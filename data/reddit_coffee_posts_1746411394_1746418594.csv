I've been actively connecting with people on LinkedIn, tailoring my connections to alumni and mutual connections who are in finance, investment banking, and the Big 4. Most of the people I reach out to are analyst, associates, managers, directors and partners. I also do cold emailing.

While many have accepted my connection requests, my messages often go unread or remain marked as ""delivered"" without being opened, even though they're active on LinkedIn. I feel like some may be ignoring me. A few have responded, and I really appreciate those who took the time for a coffee chat.

I‚Äôve extremely tailored my messages to different people, but I‚Äôm wondering what I can do to improve my response rate. I'm putting so much effort and not getting anything. I attached some of my messages below.

Here‚Äôs the plot I have in mind ‚¨áÔ∏è

The Other Side of Paradise-Ever since you were little you knew that you wanted to be a famous musician one day and that it was only a matter of time before you made your dreams happen.

You held down odd jobs in highschool but never for long because you knew it's not what you wanted to do with your life.
When you graduated your parents convinced you to go to college and offered to pay for it as long as they saw that you were trying, which you did at first.

You got a job at a local radio station which scratched your itch for musical stimulation for a while. You spent your first year conversing with the callers about whatever music was popular and sometimes getting to play your favorites when the locals weren't calling in any requests. You even started dating a barista at a cafe that was on the same block as the radio station! You really felt content in life for a bit.

As you eased into your second year though you felt that musical itch come back, stronger than ever this time.
You didn't just want to play the same pop songs and listen to the same people call in their opinions day in and day out, you wanted to be a rock and roll star.

You slowly worked towards putting together a tape and sending it out to a bunch of record labels and by the beginning of your third year in college you got a call back from one willing to take a chance.
The only problem was that it was one of the few you applied to that would require you to move across the country from your family and partner. Which is exactly why you decided not to tell anyone until the day you packed everything up and dropped out.

On the day you left you hugged your family good bye and had a very tearful goodbye turned break up with your partner. You decided to end things when you felt like they didn't support what they called ""Your irrational, spur of the moment decision"". They had screamed about the life you had planned together and how you couldn't just leave out of nowhere to pursue some wacky dream.
That didn't matter, all that mattered was your chance to rock, which actually went really well.

You sold out stadiums and arenas in the years to come afterwards and became quite the star. After about 10 years that life took a toll on you though and you decided since you had made the mark(and the money) you wanted to make that your next tour would be your last. On the way to your last tour stop you noticed that your next tour location was your hometown! You hadn't visited since you left due to your parents moving closer to you about two years after you moved.

On your first morning there you decided to visit your old work place as well as the coffee shop you remembered
frequenting so much when you were younger. You remembered that place had really good banana bread. You noticed when you and your crew went to order though that the owner was different now than it was then but still familiar somehow? They also didn't seem very fond of you, which was very odd for you to experience. Didn't they know who you were? Most people would kill to have any interaction with you at all. You made it your mission to figure out what their problem was before you leave in 3 weeks to head back home.

Hi Reddit,
I (34F) was married for 6 years. From the outside, we looked like a normal couple. I feel like I was emotionally, physically, and financially alone‚Äîwhile believing I was in a partnership


We were trying to conceive for the last 4 years and went through multiple fertility treatments‚ÄîIVF, IUI. He was emotionally ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù on the surface, but over time, I began noticing patterns that now feel impossible to ignore.

Intimacy was always disconnected. He rarely showed real interest in sex. Intercourse was brief, emotionally passive, and I never saw clear signs of ejaculation. He would go to the washroom right after, saying he needed to clean up. There was never any visible release, and I only climaxed once in six years. He avoided physical intimacy more and more as time went on, offering vague excuses.

Now I wonder if he was intentionally withdrawing to avoid conception. When I recently confronted him, he didn‚Äôt deny or confirm‚Äîhe just said, ‚ÄúIf you think that, then there‚Äôs no point in staying together.‚Äù
That shook me to my core.

Financially, he was irresponsible and evasive. He let his aging father and me carry major household expenses, including rent and bills, while he spent most of what he earned on himself. He‚Äôd lie about payments, offer no proof, or say he ‚Äúpaid in cash.‚Äù Even now, when I asked to see mobile bills for transparency, he refused to share logs digitally‚Äîsaying I‚Äôd ‚Äústart digging‚Äù.

I also discovered he had been emotionally involved with a woman from work. He admitted to meeting her for coffee and buying books together, but insisted they were ‚Äújust friends.‚Äù Meanwhile, he continued telling me he loved me and couldn‚Äôt live without me.

When I asked for honest answers‚Äîto acknowledge the deception around conception, finances, and emotional intimacy‚Äîhe went silent. No response, no accountability. Just more deflection and vague promises to ‚Äúfix everything.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt even know what I was in anymore. I feel like I was emotionally, physically, and financially alone‚Äîwhile believing I was in a partnership. I feel broken. I feel ashamed. And yet I still question myself: Am I overthinking? Did I miss something obvious?

How do you trust your instincts again after something like this? Has anyone ever experienced such subtle but deep deception?

I‚Äôve tried to manage it on my own, but today something happened that broke me and opened my eyes.

It was a normal morning. My wife, our 14-month-old son, and I woke up around 11 a.m. She stayed in the kitchen making breakfast, and I went to the garage with our son to clean the cars. I had him in one arm like I usually do‚Äîhe can walk, but he always wants me to carry him, and I love holding him while I get things done.

I was searching for an extension cord for the vacuum but couldn‚Äôt find it. Frustrated, I gave up and went back inside to get some coffee. I still had my son in my arm.

Then it happened.

As I took one step toward the fridge, I slipped. It all happened so fast. I tried to hold on to him I really did but I wasn‚Äôt quick enough. He fell from about five feet, face first.

My heart sank. I thought the worst. I thought I‚Äôd just ruined my son‚Äôs life.

We rushed him to the hospital. And here‚Äôs the part I can‚Äôt explain: he was completely fine. Not a scratch. No injury. The doctors kept asking me to explain what happened because it didn‚Äôt make sense. But I saw it with my own eyes. He should‚Äôve been hurt.

I believe I witnessed a miracle one foot away from me.

I don‚Äôt care if people want to judge me. I know I failed in that moment. But I also know God showed up. He gave me a second chance not just for my son‚Äôs life, but for mine too.

Today, I‚Äôm surrendering my life to Jesus Christ. I‚Äôve seen His mercy firsthand, and I can‚Äôt walk away unchanged. If you‚Äôre struggling with your faith or your past don‚Äôt give up. He‚Äôs still working miracles.

I‚Äôm still in shock as I write this. Honestly, I needed help putting this into words, so I asked ChatGPT to help me share it clearly. I just want someone out there to know you‚Äôre not alone, and God is real.",3,1746418066.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

TLDR: Hardcore gambler grandma with crazy loanshark debts. Crazy manipulative and even went to jail due to illegal activity to pay off debt (At 60).. Now in 80‚Äôs and still manipulative but at least no more debts as the jail term triggered a change. Also steals a lot in the past due to her debts.

Womanizing uncle who has same habits as above but not due to gambling, all money is to feed diff woman. 

Down to my mum whom never cared for me in the past as was busy with diff toxic man. 1st my drug addict dad(They didn‚Äôt get married, I was born out of wedlock) who went to jail and came out hating on me thinking I‚Äôll harass him and beg him to pls shower me with fatherly love. I grew up without him so I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs his issue. (More on this next time)
Next was the man she married and bore 2 sons with. He was a pervert and sick man whom sexually abused me when I was 6-7. She didn‚Äôt believe me when I told her. Than there were a few other man, I remember one was married and than I had to live with another one also whom was crazy controlling. Basically we were just moving a lot and staying with different man. 
Basically I don‚Äôt have really know what it is like to have real motherly/fatherly love. 
I have relied on myself since I was 15. Before that my grandpa was around so he took care of me but also he suffered greatly as he had to pay grandma‚Äôs debts and mum‚Äôs debts.

I started working my ass off at 15 and also at the same time having to pay off mum‚Äôs loan sharks debts. Similarly to her mum(grandma), they have this monstrous gambling habit which incurred massive debts from loan sharks. I‚Äôve experienced all the spray paint/ hot coffee sprayed on door and being followed by loanshark runners since teenage days. 

From staying in diff man‚Äôs house/ diff houses to staying in a rental flat. Life was a turmoil.

Always tell myself that this generational ‚Äúcurse‚Äù needs to end with me. I must not gamble and I must not borrow money from others mindlessly. 

Both grandma and mum are the worse examples. 
And tbh, up till today I hate myself and I always dwell on this because I feel really really bad that these 2 people are whom I NEVER WANT TO BECOME. Sometimes I feel like I should have just left long ago and not even fulfill the basic duty of ‚Äútaking care‚Äù of them. I always have this thought but never brave enough to do it.

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôve grown up, I‚Äôm successful (my definition is that I have a stable job, I have sufficient savings cos I worked my ass off since 15, I bought a hdb, I pay all the bills at home, I give her allowance and I really do my best to fulfill my ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù duties.) I‚Äôm happily married and I have a husband whom understands this situation I am in and always try to listen to me when I rant. Context is I‚Äôm in my 30‚Äôs now. 

But some things just don‚Äôt change, she still has a disgusting gambling habit where however money she has, she would gamble it all away, she has no savings and she just lives this way. She‚Äôs had stints of theft in her previous cashiering job and sometimes, cash at home goes missing, my gold necklace goes missing. Cancer struck her few years ago but it doesn‚Äôt scare her‚Ä¶ she is still living this way. My husband says she will never change so I just gotta accept things as it is. I don‚Äôt know how to put it into words, is it right to despise her? She‚Äôs nearly 60 and sometimes I have really heinous thoughts asking myself why must I put up with this for additional 40 years or so‚Ä¶.. The thoughts are really killing me at times and emotionally torturous. 

I just want to know if anyone faces this generational trauma issue here? Any stories to share?

1kf2n4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/USDIY/comments/1kf2n4e/what_do_you_mean_by_garbage_disposal/,What do you mean by garbage disposal?,"**What Is a Garbage Disposal?**

A garbage disposal is a kitchen appliance installed under the sink that grinds food waste into tiny particles, allowing it to flow through plumbing without causing clogs. These devices help reduce food waste in landfills and offer a convenient way to dispose of kitchen scraps.

# Types of Garbage Disposals

There are two main types of garbage disposals, each with distinct advantages:

**Batch Feed Disposals**

* Operates only when the magnetic stopper is in place and pressed down
* Safer option for households with children or pets
* Generally quieter operation due to better insulation
* Handles larger amounts of food waste at once
* Typically requires an electrical outlet under the sink

**Continuous Feed Disposals**

* Runs continuously until switched off
* Allows adding food while the disposal is running
* Requires constant water flow during operation
* More common and typically less expensive
* Fits more easily in smaller spaces
* Usually hardwired into home electrical system

# Motor Size Matters

Garbage disposals are rated by horsepower (HP), which determines grinding power:

* Higher HP = finer grinding and less chance of clogs
* Larger motors tend to be quieter due to better insulation
* Common sizes range from 1/3 HP to 1 HP
* For most households, 3/4 HP provides a good balance of performance and price

# Key Features to Look For

* **Stainless steel grinding chamber**: Resists corrosion and rust
* **Multi-stage grinding**: Different speeds for various food types
* **Auto-reverse function**: Helps clear jams without manual intervention
* **Quick-mount neck**: Makes installation easier
* **Air pressure switch**: Safer alternative to traditional electrical switches
* **Baffle**: Prevents items from falling in and reduces splashing

# Proper Usage and Maintenance

**Do:**

* Run cold water while operating the disposal
* Continue running water 30 seconds after grinding to flush pipes
* Grind citrus peels to freshen the disposal
* Use a mix of baking soda and vinegar for cleaning

**Don't:**

* Put fibrous foods (celery, corn husks) down the disposal
* Dispose of coffee grounds, eggshells, or starchy foods
* Pour grease or fat down the drain
* Use bleach in disposals connected to septic systems
* Place non-food items in the disposal

# Common Problems and Solutions

**Clogs**: Usually occur in the drain pipe, not the disposal itself. Use regular drain cleaning methods.

**Jams**: Most units have a reset button and a manual turn slot at the bottom that can be operated with a wrench to dislodge blockages.

**Leaks**: Check three common points:

1. Sink mount (apply putty to seal)
2. Dishwasher inlet (check hose clamp)
3. Waste outlet (check rubber gasket and screws)

**Noise**: Higher-end models are typically quieter. Sink quality also affects noise levels.

# Considerations for Sewer and Septic Systems

* Check local regulations if connected to municipal sewers
* For septic systems, choose higher horsepower models
* Special septic-friendly models inject enzymes to help break down waste
* Disposal use may require more frequent septic tank pumping

With proper use and maintenance, a quality garbage disposal can last 10-12 years, providing a convenient way to manage food waste while keeping your plumbing in good condition.",1,1746417654.0,USDIY,0,1.0,False

3. Couch Surfer: This is a term commonly used by someone who had a network of friends/associates and/or family who would let them sleep, typically on a couch, or the floor, or somewhere in their house, at least for the night, usually on a temporary basis from a night to several nights to weeks at best. 
2: Car Life: So you don't have a network willing to take you in, or they leave you hanging, but either way, it's okay, cause you have a car! If you didn't know, Walmart will let you sleep in your car at the back of ther parking lot free! I have also lived this life. It is not pleasant in a small sedan like I lived it in, but in a van with seats removed and a lot of blankets if it's cold, it could be not half bad for homeless! 
1. Outside Homeless: So you have nobody, and you have no car and/or no license. You're stuck outside. It doesn't get any worse than this. I've thankfully never fallen this low, but my friend who I helped get out as I got sucked into drugs and homelessness was, I watched how he survived and implemented his tactics, plus mine, and some strategy inspired by a YouTuber. 

This assumes this event is taking place RIGHT ABOUT NOW in North America and places getting warm right now!! I always emphasize IF YOU MUST BE HOMELESS, TIME IT SO YOU'RE HOMELESS IN EARLIEST APRIL TO MAY, WORK, HOARD, EVERYTHING ALL SUMMER, AND SECURE SHELTER BY OCTOBER LATEST. 

Part of the reason you have to be homeless in the summer is part of the strategy involves selling beverages. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's say you're proverbially homeless, you got a Bear Grylls style drop-off in a ""hostile"" city, for the sake of familiarity, we're gonna say you're getting dropped in Milwaukee, WI. There it's getting warm, but you can't get cozy like California cause winter on the lake can be viscous. You're given a backpack with some basic resources. Assuming you don't have them, assess your morals, as one key item is a sharpie marker. If you can accept it, steal one, rip it out tbe pack unconsciously at Walmart quick and then RUN. Not suspiciously, but get in and get tf out. If you don't wanna steal, you'll have to get creative, as your starting point comes from manhandling. You weren't given a piece of cardboard, so you'll have to use your resources. Look for recycling bins in businesses as you walk busy streets until you find a cardboard box you can rip up. 

Step 1: Acquire Base Capital:
This method involves panhandling. There is an alternative step 1 that can be ran concurrently or on its own depending on your morals values. SO You got your cardboard and your pen, draft up a nice sign that says ""Homeless, Need Money To Invest In Food and Drink to Sell"" Your whole plea is ""I just need enough to buy a case of water, please. I don't wanna be begging, I'm just trying to get enough to buy something I can sell here for a profit and not beg for your change"" people are a LOT more receptive to this concept! And if you can manage to panhandle your way up on the same block without being harassed by police, you can return where those who saw/gave before are more likely to give (again) because they're like ""He wasn't kidding! He really is selling sodas and stuff!"" and while some cops if they really wanna be assholes can harass you over certain city license ordinances, they're far less likely to do that than they are stop you for straight panhandling. 

Step 1.5:
This is the alternate to step 1. So you don't wanna panhandle? Understandable. Here's how you can come up with a product to sell for free! Although it may take multiple trips, as you'll be paying visits to every Alti trash can you can get to. Learn the garbage schedule, strike at night when it's full, and put anything good around the corner! Had I did that, I wouldn't have lost an outdoor screened in zipper up gazebo thing I figured I could marketplace for like $50 easy. They throw merchandise like that away occasionally, but they also throw away PEFEECTLY GOOD food! You may be eating it yourself!! I have! And damn proud too. Aldi Trash Can is a 3 star dining experience. I'd rather eat Aldi Trash Can sweet rolls over McDonalds any day. But you can collect these goodies like the sweet rolls, and if you're lucky enough to scoop something like the gazebo, set up with a ""FOR SALE"" Sign on a busy island. List any hard goods like the gazebo on marketplace, but since you have to take it with you, that's part of what's for ""sale"" too, you want to optimize exposure. (Note that in this scenario a ""trap phone"" was provided for your survival. A trap phone is any smart phone which does not have regular service, but usually has Facebook Messenger and Textnow to call/text/IM when connected to wifi. Another more accurate name would be ""Wi-fi phone"" but on the streets if one had a ""trap phone"" everyone knew it as such, distinguishable from a ""burner"" commonly associated with trap culture, where a seperate pay as you go phone is maintained. A burner can become a trap phone if minutes are not put on it. If one does not have a phone, it is advised to spend some of your first funds on a burner to use as a trap phone. A cheap one at Walmart is usually $30-$50)

Step 2: So you've gotten something to sell, and you've changed up your sign accordingly. Now you wait for empathetic people to buy your bargain goods for discount prices. If they ask where you got it, simply tell them ""it was a donation"" or ""It's a rollover from the funds I got begging, someone offered me a deal on this stuff for a few dollars and I took it to sell for money instead of begging"" that will get a LOT more people than you'd think who'd say ""I'm not really interested in what you're selling, but here's $5 because I like what you're doing. Keep up the good work"" or they will buy it but really intend to throw it away themselves. People see a million beggars saying ""homeless need help"" every day. People are sick of that. They say ""what good does it do if I give him a dollar? He's gonna ask for another one tomorrow!"" But with this model that argument is void, because the answer is ""Yetserday you gave him a dollar, today he's invested his dollars into product which he's retailing on the same corner for a profit, which he then rolls over into more of what he's selling, and with his profits he's either investing in expanding the business, or paying himself dividends to use on things he/she needs. (We'll get to that). This is why I say summer, not only is is fine to be outside, but a guy selling water and soda especially is popular in summer. ESPECIALLY if it's cold! I recommend water first because you can get like a 24 or a 32 pack or something of generic water for like $2 at most grocery stores. The biggest thing is keeping it COLD. Try and bum off the freezer system somewhere as long as you can to cool them puppies. You might also want to panhandle till you have money for a cooler, at least the cheap plastic one. If you're selling non-refrigerated Aldi goods, don't worry. But be mindful of how you intend to carry your warez as you only have a backpack and your pockets. This is where ""borrowing"" a shopping card on city streets becomes acceptable.

Quick tip: We've already filled you in on where to eat, at the A l√† cart√© de Aldi, but how does one sustain fluids, also FREE? It's simple! Walk into any McDonalds location, so long as the soda machine is NOT behind the counter. Scope the garbage for a large soda cup, preferably chilling on top. Snatch that puppy and take it to the bathroom, run the water on hot (I'd get it STEAMING hot!) And just run that shit though it and over it for at least five minutes. After that, you assume most major bacteria dead. Any risk you assume is to be considered negligible. Being homeless is likely to expose you to all type of nasty things, so if there is some type of bacteria, they should be nothing more than a test to help boost your immune system to fight off other bad things. Keep in mind I've done this several times and never gotten sick. You then walk up to the soda machine casually, don't look sus or out of place. Just fill your glass with your drink of choice, cap it, grab a straw, and leave. This scenario assumes you have ZILCH. Obviously if you have $1, buy the soda, then do the rest of the step, which is keep the cup you cleaned/bought, even clean it out after drinking (I STRONGLY recommend this, ESPECIALLY if you plan on changing flavors) and return to any McDonalds with said cup, walk in, beeline to the fountain, pop your cap, fill your drink, and get out. Whose that guy? He went through the drive-thru. He gets free refills too. Note I've ran this routine HUNDREDS of times, including at Wendy's and BK too. Sometimes with cups from another establishment! Out of hundreds of times I've done it, a McDonalds employee noticed ONCE and made a loud announcement about it. By the time she said anything, my cup was mostly full, so I conceded and walked away early, quick, tried to shield my profile, got in the car and took off. Did not run. Even on foot whatever you do, do not run, and do not return to that restaurant. They're highly HIGHLY unlikely to call the cops, in a big city like Milwaukee, the cops are more liable to get irritated with THEM for distracting them from real crime they're hands are full of because a guy allegedly stole a refill on a $1 soda. Even if they were to show up, he honest enough to say you did it, say you bought it, but admit it was a different store earlier in the day as cameras don't lie. Use the excuse ""I'm homeless, I can't afford to pay for another soda. If i stayed where I bought it i could have as many as I want. I had other places to go. Why can't I refill my same cup at this location? It's the same day? They don't specify ""Free refills TODAY"" or ""free refills UNTIL YOU LEAVE"" they need to be more clear"" and the cops are likely going to look at you like the wittiest homeless person they ever met and admit you got them in a gray area, which may inspire more clarity and change this circumstance. I don't see any officer in their right mind charging a homeless person with theft for going into McDonalds and filling a cup of soda that costs $1. It's so petty they'd probably cite you for disorderly at worst, and if they did charge you, go talk to the DA and I bet any money the DA drops or reduces the charge. And if they for some reason didn't, it two whole sectors let you down, I'm sure finding a judge to convict you on that would be hard up. 

Step 3: So you're selling, making money, congratulations! Looks like you're low/out of stock! Looks like a trip to Walmart is in order! Remember how much cash you spent last time? Well count up what cash you got, put it in your trap phone calculator and subtract from it the amount you spent last time. This number is your profit margin. This number is what you gained in value on your sales. Congrats! That's real money, and you earned it! Now what do you do with it? That depends on how much you have, and your circumstances. You always want to ""roll over"" or reinvest what you spent before again on the same thing, so another cycle of profits can come in off the same money you started with. With your profits, you can expand busjness, by buying bulk items like popular soda, flavors of Gatorade, or candy bars are good items that sell on an island and are easily portable. With your profits at this point you'd really like to invest in a big plastic cooler with wheels if you can get one, and a few bags of ice. Keeping all your beverages and candy in a cooler is key. If you have to, get 2 rolling coolers. Stop at Ace Hardware, go to the copper wire by the strand, look for 12 Guage wire, you'll want to buy several strands and a wire stripper (you can return the wire stripper later. It avoids awkward in and out trips if possible.) The strands should be at least 3' long. You'll want 12 SOLID not STRANDED. I REPEAT, DO NOT GET STRANDED!! STRANDED LACKS THE TENSILE STRENGTH NEEDED TO DO THIS!! Now, with one strand, starting towards the end, wrap from the bottom part of the top of the handle upwards, leaving about 6"" to the end on one left and the rest on the right. Hold the loop tight to the shape, then start wrapping the short end TIGHT, top to bottom. Like PULL hard on the wire as you pull it up and around while holding it steady, then pull TIGHT again as you go down and around the bottom half, the pull TIGHT as you wrap until it's done. This should hold somewhat tight, and the coil should be tightly would (so that each wrap around touches or is close to the previous) then kick the other wagon right next to it. Take the long end and stretch it to the other handle TIGHT, and repeat the same wrapping process. This is to start to tie the two carts together. To reinforce the bond, the second strand is wrapped tightly starting the same way OVER the securing wraps on both sides, starting on one, and bridges the gap not straight, but SPIRALING around the straight, taunt tie-wire. I recommend at least 2 of these for support. If you're using a shopping cart, I suggest a 4th and 5th of at least 6' that would be wrapped around the tie wire before the securing wires. In the center, about 6"" at most to an end would be tightly coiled around the tie wire. This would be wrapped over and secured by the reinforcing wire. These two wires would be braided together as they reach to the shopping cart, before they become unintwined, wrapping themselves taunt around the cart and with their last distance, tightly tying to each other like a twist tie to ensure rigidity. It's ghetto, but it'll haul your whole caravan with the push of a cart! I've seen electricians use 12 Guage to secure their ladders to the top of their work trucks driving 60+ so it's solid!

Step 4: Let's say business is going well, you've managed to save up some profits, what's the FIRST thing you should get? A tent. Get yourself a tent to sleep in. If it's not day one you get your tent, I'd scope out abandoned buildings in the meantime, someplace that's not super filthy, but is out the way and unlikely anyone will bother you. And it provides some shelter from the elements. A bridge or train overpass is the next best place, as it'll keep the rain off your face, but it's less secure. You always face the risk of coming face-to-face with urban explorers at best, at worst someone coming to do you harm, and in between, the police who are almost guaranteed not to show up unless you're caught going in there or some ruckus brings them there. Assuming you're caught there, plus the homeless plea, you likely won't walk away with a ticket, you'll simply be told you can't come back there again or that time you WILL get a ticket. Even with a tent, the right factory can still be an ideal shelter, the tent acts as a ""bubble"" of insulation for you from the elements around you. 

Step 4: Assuming you're at the same point we are in this tek, you have established shelter, food even if via Aldi, drink if via infinite soda glitch, and a trap phone, on top of your corner hustle to bring in profits, you're likely at a point now where you've got the bare basics, which this hustle was meant to provide. It's not gonna get you into a place to live, unfortunately. So it's time to invest those profits into some cheap pocket Tees at Wal-Mart, I rock em every day, have for years, they're like $15 a 4 pack, you can get by with 1 and maybe an extra pair of blue jeans or two. Then look for a truck stop where you can pay to shower. If they're not available, pay for a gym membership, you can shower there. In the meantime, start applying to jobs within your vicinity, places you can walk or at worse bus to. If you're gonna have to bus it, try and allocate profits to a bus pass. REMEMBER: Time is ticking! The clock is NOT your friend! This corner trick is just to root you and help you germinate. Your real growth comes from an actual JOB. Following these preemptive steps ensures you can find employment by having a wide enough variety of clean clothes and a place to shower to appear clean. If you wear the same outfit until you start work, and recycle outfits, you can likely withhold a trip to the laundromat until you can do the corner hustle on a day off at least, or until you get paid if desperate. If you have to, find a temp service near you. Some in big cities actually bus you to the job and take it out your pay. It'll be a shitty job, but it's a start and you'll need it. 

Step 5: So you found a job, congratulations! Now you must survive until your first check. Try to continue your routine, sleep in your tent, eat out the Aldi Trash Can (though you should also have stopped at the local SNAP office in the US day one and asked for emergency food share for being homeless. In Milwaukee you'd get a temporary card printed out thatd be active in 6 hours with over a months worth of benefits. This resource would cover both food and drink entirely) and even if your drinks are McDonalds, and you shower at Planet Fitness, keep your head up. Keep coming to work, and when you get that first check, go straight to a CREDIT UNION, not a bank, and ask to open a checking and a savings account. Leave $5-$10 in savings and deposit the rest in your checking for security, and ask for a debit card. This will allow you to make purchases online, which you can have securely sent to you while homeless by purchasing a PO box if you choose. Now as tempting as it may be, your goal is to be as frugal as possible. If you can eat and drink on SNAP/Aldi and McDonalds, keep doing that. Keep costs to that of laundering and showering as you want to maintain the image of a clean, non-homeless person. Purchases of any necessary personal hygiene products are obviously justifiable.

Step 6: One thing to consider when homeless from day 1: Put thought into getting a dog, especially if you can get one free. You want a LARGE dog, a Labrador, a German Shepard, something that can protect you. Do not get a freaking poodle, that is not an asset, that is a liability which defeats the dogs purpose of being there. It is a companion that can make dark times seem better too, however, the point of the dog is self-defense. The dog will hear and smell someone coming upon you while you sleep and hear them even if you're awake long before you do, their barking will either scare the intruder away, or give you time to be prepared to defend. If someone does make an attack, your dog is likely to attack back. Dogs are known to give their life for their master, even if it means you lose your dog, if it attacks a would-be attacker, run. Your dog is doing what it believes is its most honorable, most sacred duty; To give its life for its ""master"", the one to who them gave them and was everything. Keep in mind, people are NOT kind to the homeless! I've seen instances of people being killed. Shot. Set on fire. Just for being homeless sleeping in a doorway or on a bench. This drives homeless people to places like abandoned factories, where crimes committed against them are less likely to be seen. They tend to have little to no family, friends, a job, anybody who'd come looking for them if they went missing. This and the fact that police tend to put less effort into finding a homeless guy because homelessness comes with an image of perceived drug abuse, alcoholism, mental health defect, or ""lazy bum"" who ""just doesn't wanna work"" therefore they tend to get glossed over when they are reported missing, almost always after a crucial period of time passes which slashes the likelihood of a conviction ever being made. The other aspect that makes the dog viable, is the fact that it can eat human food. It can and will eat Aldi's trash can with you, even if it is tomatoes, the dog don't care. And if you do have to beg, a sign saying ""Homeless, if you can't help me, please feed my dog"" and you'd be surprised how many people will come with either money or straight food saying ""will he/she eat this?"" You may even get the super generous chap who sees you, goes to McDonalds and comes back with a bag of food at your intersection and says ""There's a burger and a fry for you and the dog, good luck, stay safe"" One thing I've learned is people HATE the blatant ""gimmes"" like ""homeless please help"" if theyre gonna be hit up for a freebe, they're more likely to say yes if for example, the sign makes them laugh like ""Too ugly for prostitution, anything helps"" some people will give because it made them laugh. Asking for food ESPECIALLY for a dog is likely to bring in possible cash and definite food offers. Asking for money as venture capital to invest in beverages will entice people to donate, ESPECIALLY if you can tell them if they donate ""Please come back past my intersection in a day or two so you can see I really did it, and if you shopped with me I'd appreciate it, but I really wanna show you what I'm doing with the money and say thank you"" but be GENUINE, and be HUMBLE. People can tell when you're being for real, showing gratitude even for the littlest bit shows you're sincere, and you truly are desperate. Your insistence to come back and see you grow goes to show serious intent.

Step 7: So you've managed to keep hoarding checks while living the homeless dream life. How are you feeling? Consult with your calendar to see where you are on the cycle. If it's June, July, well you have decisions to make. Cause we're gonna assume you've saved up enough to get a CHEAP place to live. If you're pushing September, you have no choice really. But if you have a few months, an opportunity presents itself: Stay homeless until October 1st to bank every penny you can, in an attempt to have money for a car and a place to rent by that time. If you cannot endure the conditions, nobody blames you for bailing. But you're already there, if you can handle it, keep it up, you'll save hundreds to over a thousand dollars a month! 

Step 8: It's now September, and homeless season is about over. You're exploring shelter options, you can either rent a fixed place, or you can purchase a vehicle, which you'd be able to sleep in (let's assume it's a van for comfort) your main expenses outside shower and laundry will be gasoline, you'll be able to charge your phone from the cigarette port with a converter. You can burn gas to run the heat, and investing in a few blankets. I've slept snug as a bug in my sedan in February/March as it snowed around me. Wal-Mart will let you park at the back of their lot and sleep as long as you want. I lived at Wal-Mart for a while. If the security asked why I was there, I'd tell them I'm homeless this is where I live, and I'd ask them ""Can you please keep an eye on me when you make your rounds near my vehicle on patrol? If I'm here I'm either in it sleeping or I'm in the store buying something or using the restroom."" And they'd always nod their head and be like ""Ok, just as long as we know you're here, then we know you're not out of place or anything and if there's anyone else around here that they're not with you."" Some people may opt to live this lifestyle and bank their checks until they get to the point of being able to BUY a house! Some people never leave this scenario at all. By choice in this case. I've heard of people living this lifestyle with over $1m in the bank.

Step 9: Well, by now you're sheltered, either in a car or a home. The logical next goal is to acquire the opposite of what you got. If you got a car, rent/buy a home. If you have a home, buy a new or used car. At this point, you're essentially ""free"" from homelessness. By definition you're free as soon as you have a home, but getting from nothing on that bottom level of homelessness helps get to that second level, and gets you there with a startup for gas and such. So there you go, you went from absolutely nothing and homeless to back on your feet. Congratulations! You deserve a pat on the back. 

Step 10: This is the most important step in my opinion: TEACH SOMEONE ELSE! Use the resources, the knowledge you gained, share YOUR tips and tricks you discovered as well as mine that helped you, cause it may put someone else in that same situation! 

REMEMBER: Homelessness is temporary!! Right now we are at the BEST time of the year to be homeless! Nobody WANTS to, it's like going to jail, but sometimes you MUST go, and NOW is as good a time as ever. This is just an outline, it may not work as perfect as surmised here, but if you work it, you will survive and eventually you should get ahead. Progression is the key. I tried to illustrate a scenario where you could be dead dropped in a large metro area with nothing but your clothes, a backpack, and maybe a trap phone, 0 dollars, and be able to find shelter, get money coming for basic necessities, get established to get working, survive while you save, and have the money needed to be sheltered/housed by October.

I guess it‚Äôs especially making me sad because I do everything baby and house related.

In other words, I have somewhat of a tolerance to things (copious high-doses of stimulants highly excluded, not referring to caffeine but things like meth, cocaine, etc. I was never a fan although I love  the stimulant-like effects from coffee+kratom, that's my daily go-to). I want to start low and go slow for safety purposes but I'm looking for a particular desired effect and that doesn't seem to be what people are getting from the starter doses here?

I am primarily interested in the mdma-like/connected/euphoric effects of Kanna and would like to know what a good starter dose would be for such an experience?

I'm also wondering the following:

\-Are the nasal sprays are as harsh as insufflating the regular powder?

\-Is fermented the most popular for euphoria+connected mdma-like effects? Read that it was so that's why I'm asking

\-What is the best powder (I'm planning on going w/the healing herbals brand)if I wanted to mix w/ coffee, hot chocolate, teas,etc.?

\-Lastly, I've read online it isn't safe to take higher doses (I mean about 75-100mg)of the Sceletium Tortuosum (someone on here said they noticed the desired effects I am looking for after taking 75mg of it), is this true?

I have been unappreciated, ignored, insulted for so long. I never said much back because growing up I dealt with it from my father and ended up finding someone exactly like him without even knowing it before it was too late. I complained to my husband before about my cousin growing up. When our grandma was alive she would ask us favors like rub her feet, get her coffee etc. I was always doing it with a smile on my face and my cousin either got annoyed or she had to be paid to do anything for her. She would make fun of my acne or just be rude to other people too. Years ago I asked my husband to go to a holiday dinner with my family and he usually never wanted to go. This time he went and he saw my younger cousin and decided to use it against me that I was jealous of her. This has stuck with me for so long because after everything I told him he was just stuck on looks because he couldn‚Äôt believe how pretty she was. I was already insecure before and even more now but I never was jealous of anyone. A marriage like this took such a mental toll on me because this wasn‚Äôt even the worse thing he said to me.

Wish we had more of those random diner/coffee shop get-together scenes with them like in the earlier seasons. I loved when all of them unintentionally synced up to visit Julia after Joel moved out ü•π

- Zeek and Camille‚Äôs relationship growth from S1 felt realistic. You could see her festered resentment in S1 and the emotional distance between them, then the slow buildup as he earns her back and she finds her own voice in their marriage. I really didn‚Äôt think they would show his death, and her finding him hit me hard :(

- Kristina‚Äôs cancer was probably one of the strongest storylines imo. Something about that scene where she gets sick at home after chemo and Adam takes care of her really tugged at me. Haddie flying out and wanting to take on more responsibility for her was also heartwarming; loved her appearance right before Kristina tells the whole family her diagnosis (a great scene)

- That being said, I feel like they didn‚Äôt know what to do with some characters later on? Not sure if the actress was doing other stuff, but Haddie was MIA for basically all of S5 until the very end. In S6 we atleast got a few throwaway mentions of her character but still

- ^ Likewise, Joel and Julie‚Äôs drama dragged on for WAY too long, and that plotline got worse as it progressed. The writing for S5 Joel felt like a shell of who his character actually was. We deserved more buildup and payoff for their reconciliation; there were whole eps in S6 where they had zero screen time. And then they decided to adopt Victor‚Äôs half-sister within weeks of getting back together, while still having issues to work out??.. Sure üòê

- Drew‚Äôs college romance with Natalie was honestly very dry, and her character felt messy the moment she slept with his roommate. He had more chemistry with Amy for her brief return and I wish they had been endgame! Would‚Äôve been cool to see Drew have actual college experiences in lecture, at the dining hall, etc. And with Berto!! What a funny himbo he was lmao

- Amber‚Äòs pregnancy felt forced for the sake of the generational premise. I‚Äôm glad she wanted to be a mom and they made her a larger part of the Luncheonette, but S2 Academically Driven Amber was really endearing. I would‚Äôve loved to see a plotline of her taking some community college classes and developing passion for a career path on her own. Like girl was only 22 in S6!! Sidenote- her and Ryan seemed really toxic/he was terrible at communication so I‚Äôm glad the finale didn‚Äôt force that upon us

- Oh, Sarah. I feel like her being played by Lauren Graham made us like her as much as we did bc oh boy, LOL. I am glad she became serious about photography, but I definitely was tired of her flighty / self-sabotaging tendencies throughout the seasons (case in point, Mark). Her and Hank were good together, but I also couldn‚Äôt help but think ‚Äúthat‚Äôs literally Ray Romano‚Äù every other time I saw him üò≠

- Crosby and Adam‚Äôs bromance was hilarious. I loved the random moments of them bickering with each other which usually ended with Crosby roasting Adam for being a lame white guy. Him ‚Äúcoming down with The Fever‚Äù was always a guaranteed laugh from me lolol

- The actor for Max did a phenomenal job. I think Adam/Kristina‚Äôs parenting when it came to Max was definitely too lax at times, esp during the Dylan plotline. He was harassing her, and I was surprised Kristina didn‚Äôt take it all that seriously when Dylan came to her

- I get the show is central to the Bravermans, but it would‚Äôve been interesting to dive more into the families of the spouses as well. We got a few offhanded mentions (Kristina‚Äôs mom married very young, Joel‚Äôs dad was unfaithful to his mom), but putting more energy into those backstories as full-fleshed plotlines could‚Äôve prevented some of the seemingly lackluster ones (Joel/Julia in S5, Drew‚Äôs college love triangle, Hank‚Äôs daughter)

I got off a cruise on Sunday. Never had problems with sea sickness in my entire life. My son gets motion sickness the poor little guy any time we drive further than an hour he pukes and he won‚Äôt take medicine. He triumphantly said ‚ÄúI can live like this‚Äù fist raised in the back seat after the third time he puked on our way down to the cruise. They all wore patches behind their ears the first 2/3 of the cruise I didn‚Äôt bother, I‚Äôve been on rough boats before

Anyway great cruise we get off I drive home through New York City traffic to get back to our home in western MA. When I get home and start unpacking I realize I feel like I‚Äôm still on the boat. Everything is rocking and I feel things moving just a little bit when they shouldn‚Äôt be. On the cruise I took some cough suppressant containing DXM because I didn‚Äôt want to cough on a cruise ship. I wasn‚Äôt sick before I got on so don‚Äôt give me any shit i brought it as a precaution along with a million other things I didn‚Äôt need because it was our family‚Äôs first time cruising. 

So my wife and I unpack she goes grocery shopping the angel she is I get laundry going (so much laundry after a cruise) and my kids of course help by using up all the data we didn‚Äôt while we were away by looking at 87373 screens. She‚Äôs also reporting feeling ‚Äúwavy‚Äù. I see other people online report similar.

I go to bed and go to work the next day I‚Äôm an early riser I‚Äôm up at 5:30am nearly every day. Monday night I am never able to fall asleep and end up pulling an all nighter. Every time I closed my eyes the room would spin and I‚Äôd want to puke. I wasn‚Äôt eating much but I was drinking. I had coffee Tuesday morning really early and went into work early. I knew if I was slept I was done for and wouldn‚Äôt get any work done. Did my time came home, crashed out a couple hours woke up in time to get my kids home from school and repeated until Friday. About an hour before I would normally stay I decided to leave. Later that night, I got lost in my own neighborhood about 1000 feet from my house, broken down with panic and confused where I was. I had never had any kind of mental health episode like this so I was convinced I was dying. I was absolutely soaked in sweat. This is what cats do right they go away from their family to die right? 

Anyway I did in fact not die, I make it home yadda yadda yadda. My wife and I do some research and we discover I‚Äôve had a manic episode. (We are both in therapy and we both have therapy friends, it is what it is. )

So while we navigate this I get wind of this tech test. I hop in the discord. I see someone say that they will help if you can make them laugh with a meme. Well SHIT. If you wanna laugh why didn‚Äôt you say so. I‚Äôm a really bad stand up comedian that makes Mitch Hedberg meets dad joke type nonsense jokes. So I sent 3 jokes I am working on to this guy and they gave mea cod e.  Can‚Äôt thank them more this game is fucking unreal. 

I‚Äôve been playing video games since I was 4 years old. One time I must have escaped whatever child sleep confines I had at the time and I caught my mom playing Mario brothers for the NES on the small tv in the corner of the room. She was sat on the bed and she let me play. I made her help me with the jumps that night and maybe the next night but then I was off and running. And then the Nintendo wasn‚Äôt hers anymore. I played a lot of great games I‚Äôm sure you all did too if you‚Äôre from that age. This was 1987. 

I kept gaming all through Super Nintendo and Sega. Had em both. Played all the great ones. 

I played PlayStation and all those great games in era. 

When Mortal Kombat 3 came out back in the day i somehow convinced my poor grandmother (rest her soul) to bring me and a friend to the Arcade because I wanted to be the first kid to play it. I had gotten a tip from a magazine that I could use sektor and his fatality would be simply to pull off‚Ä¶it was the compactor one if you‚Äôre familiar. Anyway we get there early. I‚Äôm a dumb kid and I just know the game comes out that day but it‚Äôs getting late. My poor grandmother hangs in there. 

Finally the cabinet rolls out. My friend and I have at this point made it clear what we are doing and since this is pre internet we are guaranteed first game. Once the machine starts a crowd starts forming and people are putting quarters on the ridges below the screen (iykyk) so we aren‚Äôt getting a second game. I pick Sektor my buddy picked Baraka I believe, I end up winning and I pull off the fatality. In a mic drop moment 20 years before there ever was one I leave my free game for the buzzards and my friend and I run to my grandmothers 90 ford escort parked out in the parking lot of the now defunct Lincoln Mall, in Rhode Island. We left from that mall champions that day in a ford escort and that is a rare thing. 


After that i picked up a computer. I played some Diablo 3 and Baulders gate but we didn‚Äôt have an internet connection and when we did I wasn‚Äôt particularly compelled to use it but that changed when I heard of EverQuest. I bought the game and begged for a subscription and was obliged. I created my character the day the servers went live in March 1999. I was barely 16 and had just flunked my drivers test because I didn‚Äôt know my hand signals. 

Over the next year and a half Everquest changed my life. I couldn‚Äôt believe the world I had been dropped into and all the unique
And unexpected interactions I was having in an immersive world. I didn‚Äôt even know raiding was a thing in a game when I started but I ended up in a guild called Afterlife in EQ and we got some world firsts and it was fun and all. Then I finally got my drivers license and didn‚Äôt game much for awhile. 

Eventually once I finished college I got back into gaming. I‚Äôve played all the extraction shooters, I‚Äôve played helldivers 2 and all the other games this draws influence from. 

This game absolutely is the most immersive and fun game I‚Äôve ever played, especially for someone my demographic, the often meme‚Äôd 40 year old dad getting dunked on in all these games once you get off school and before your Ritalin gets pissed out and you sleep. 

First thing I went in completely blind. I intended to learn as I go. 

From the legend of Zelda they have the guardian style mechanic combined with an almost metal gear solid style mechanic or maybe the star system in gta? I‚Äôm not sure how everything works but I know shit always tends to snowball pretty badly for me when I‚Äôm out in the open or can‚Äôt ditch aggro. 

From Hunt they give you the POI of the map. Good shits over in this area if you wanna get some action head here. And the compass with the extracts reminds me of hunts

They simplified all the pain points from Tarkov when it comes to crafting , stash management, gun and ammo management as far as someone that wants to know what bullets go in what guns and what attachments go where and do what I can make a kit and go quickly and not dread menu hopping for half an hour because I pushed PvP and got domed. In Tarkov I always had gear fear because it was time fear. I don‚Äôt want to spend my limited time gaming in menus. I‚Äôm a dad of two after all. 

The challenges and battle pass borrow all the great things from other games I‚Äôve played. They really knocked all of this out of the park. 

And so one thing with manic episodes is everything feels really awesome. And since I‚Äôm a fresh crazy person never having been manic before, apparently one of the things is delusions of grandeur or interpreting things incorrectly. So when I finally as a 41 year old dad got my VoIP working and every single person I encountered was echoing my sentiment, it really went a long way in helping me realize that hey, maybe im not crazy. Maybe the robots are out to get us.

1kf28ft,https://i.redd.it/ci94fv62wvye1.jpeg,"The meaning of organic life, simplified.","4:03 AM: The cylindrical mass stirred, alarmed by internal chemical processes. It emitted a wheezing noise through its respiratory tube, a signal for immediate action. The older, four-legged hairy tube paced the room, its digestive anatomy spasming with urgency. A glistening trail of excretory residue marked its path across the tiled terrain.

The bipedal reproductive tube, semi-conscious, clumsily extended appendages toward the wrinkled leash coil. The leash, a synthetic tether with a cost of $15.99, was attached to the elder‚Äôs cylindrical body, a precaution against untethered movement in the external hunting ground.

They stepped into the predawn darkness, the hairy quadrupedal tube hunching suddenly. Its waste matter erupted, steaming in the January air‚Äîa product of the digestive cycle powered by commercial brown kibble ($49.99 per 30-pound bag). The bipedal tube‚Äôs sensory organ wrinkled in a futile display of disgust as the fecal matter joined the ecosystem.

5:00 AM: Back within the containment unit, the bipedal life form, designated as ‚Äúfather tube‚Äù by the younger inhabitants of the space, began the energy restoration process. Hot liquid (coffee, $12.99 per pound) was poured into a ceramic containment vessel. The youngest cylindrical inhabitant, a partially developed genetic duplicate, stumbled to the table, clutching a rectangular carbohydrate disk covered in a viscous dairy secretion (cereal and milk: $8.00 per meal).

The father tube regarded the smaller tube, recalling the costs: prenatal care ($14,000), education to date (indeterminate). The smaller being chewed mindlessly, internal enzymes dismantling the cereal‚Äôs sugar polymers.

6:30 AM: A transition ritual. The father tube dressed its outer membrane in a cloth casing (suit, $249.99) and departed in a mobile metallic pod requiring regular liquid hydrocarbon infusion ($3.79 per gallon). Tubes in other pods swarmed the asphalt arteries of the land, each advancing toward its respective cell in the hive of economic exchange.

At the hive, the father tube exchanged time and mental processing units for monetary credits, which were converted back into survival inputs for the other tubes. These exchanges occurred under artificial light, within a cuboidal space outfitted with a chair ($150) and desk ($300).

12:00 PM: Lunch break. The father tube exchanged $9.99 for a rectangle of flattened grain encasing sliced animal muscle. This muscle was the byproduct of another tube‚Äôs circulatory collapse, its life extinguished for fuel. The tube devoured its portion, digestive acids reducing it to fuel for its own survival cycle.

5:00 PM: The tubes convened at the containment unit for another energy exchange. This time, the elder tube emitted barking sounds, its tone demanding. Its soft brown eyes reflected desperate instinct. More digestion, more excretion, endless loops of hunger, satisfaction, and waste. The smaller genetic duplicate scribbled incomprehensible symbols on a page‚Äîa $2.50 spiral notebook destined for decomposition long before it contributed to the hive.

8:00 PM: The family tubes, passive now, congregated before a glowing rectangle ($799.99) displaying moving images. Their sensory organs absorbed narratives of simulated tube life, reflections of their own cycles rendered as entertainment. Calories burned throughout the day were not replaced; the father tube gripped a beer can, bitter liquid trickling down his throat ($8.99 per six-pack).

11:00 PM: Lights dimmed. The tubes folded themselves into padded compartments, preparing for a temporary cessation of all but autonomic functions. The hairy quadrupedal tube snored softly in its corner, having evacuated its bowels five times that day.

All were quiet except for the faint hum of the refrigerator, a $499.99 device maintaining the rot of biological matter at bay for another 48 hours. The father tube lay still, its purpose undefined beyond the constant feeding, cleaning, and housing of other tubes. Its chest rose and fell, a hydraulic system fueled by no greater meaning than the survival of its kind.",2,1746416245.0,ChatGPT,2,1.0,False

He is becoming an old man. I passed out last night so when I woke up I wished him a happy birthday. I love wishing people happy birthdays since everybody deserves a special day. I got ready to go and headed to my favorite bakery. I got something new to try and the owner said hello to me. I also went to do some quick shopping and did some writing before work started. Work didn't appear like it would be busy today. It was rainy and gross but you know what. It was a packed day at work. We were constantly busy and I kept helping customers throughout the day. I had to make food quick and get it out. It was awesome to be this busy and I loved every second of it. Busy means time passes quickly and I love that. I had one customer who is usually not too nice to me, even complimenting me asking if I lost weight and then telling me I looked great when I said I did. We had a seamstress come in who had a lovely armband for putting her pins and other things in. My sister even came in and stopped by to bring me a cup and money she owed me. It had sperm whales on it repressing my aunt's favorite kind of animal: whales. I had a bunch of different food thoughts today and ideas. I even thought about the housewarming food I would make for my cousin when he has his party for the new place. My sister also returned to my job bringing me a cup of coffee from a local place which was very sweet of her. I powered through the rest of the day having fun and feeling great. After work I went to the gym doing my easy peezy cardio routine. I wish I could have done more but needed to get to the movie in time. I also didn't see anybody at the gym so the time passed quickly and my cookies were not handed out. I'll get it to them sometime soon though. The best part of the gym was when I walked in and some guy came over to me to compliment my Fallout shirt. We talked about the games for a bit before I headed away. I love interactions like those. My time at the gym ended feeling great and feeling worked out. Here was my routine: 

66 minutes on the treadmill at 3.5 mph with an incline of 15 with my backpack to end it off. 

I headed to a shop to get my brother and I something before the movie. Then it was time to head to the mall. I got there much earlier than my brother and sister who decided to arrive last second, typical in their fashion. We got our concessions quickly before going to see the movie. We all watched Thunderbolts and stayed for the post credits scenes. We all discussed it afterwards saying we all liked it quite a bit far beating any recent Marvel tragedies that have been released. After the movie I brought my brother home. We talked in the car which was really nice. It was mostly random stuff I can't remember now but I enjoyed it either way. I dropped him off, kissed my cat, and headed to my cousin's house. I was greeted by my cousin's friend and we all hung out for a while talking about many random things. One of which was me trying to get his friend's pierogi recipe since half of his family is very Polish. He said he would make me stuffed cabbage some night when they have a planned pierogi making night. I can't wait for that. My cousin and his friends were very cross faded and I loved seeing them all with them giving me hugs and one gave me a smooch. Before long they came in and my cousin started making breakfast for his friend. It had been a long day for me so I slowly drifted away to sleep. I don't remember much except for my cousin covering me with a blanket before I was out. It was a great day with great people. i love seeing my family and celebrating my brother's day of life. The man who doesn't care too much for Marvel was the one who got a good Marvel movie instead of me. I love it and loved that he enjoyed his day. No complaints here for another beautiful day spent smiling. 

SBIST was the Marvel movie Thunderbolts. It was actually a really good Marvel movie in my opinion. I also got to see it with two of my favorite people, my brother and sister. I liked a lot about this movie. I liked how it tied a lot of Marvel references and things that may or may not have ever been needed to be seen again. I liked the humor a lot more than recent movies. It didn't feel as forced or silly. Some of it definitely was but I still enjoyed it. I liked the twist and I also really liked the mental health aspect to it. I won't get into it because of spoilers but it tackled the idea of some mental health things really well. It made the villain feel relatable rather than just some big bad that showed up. This movie made me cry a little bit too and I just really enjoyed it overall. It was a really good movie and I saw it with great people. And the popcorn didn't hurt either. 

Tomorrow the plan is to celebrate Star Wars Day. May the fourth be with you my conjurers. I am excited to go to a Lego store and do a make and take of Grogu. I may also buy a Lego set depending on what gifts with purchases are still left. My sister and I are excited to go to this little event. After the event I plan on shopping at a few other stores at the mall and then heading to get my car at my cousin's house. I will then go to the gym for back and biceps. After that it will be time to return home and enjoy my evening playing some games. It should be a wonderful day. Thank you my conjurers of the misfit teams.

# What Will You Actually Learn?

In the **Bond Trading Bootcamp**, you‚Äôll learn how bonds move *together* and why trading one bond in isolation (like TLT or ZB) is a rookie move. You'll get hands-on with how the yield curve affects everything. Then, in **Swinging For The Fences**, it's all about using probability and small risk to aim for big wins. You‚Äôll understand how to leverage *without* putting your account on life support. Plus, Jonathan helps you kill bad trading habits before they wreck your account. That‚Äôs gold.

It‚Äôs not some sleepy video lecture. Jonathan uses real market setups, simple explanations, and trading psychology hacks that click. You'll watch how trades are planned and executed based on logic, not feelings. The learning is actionable from day one. And yes, there's real support‚ÄîJonathan actually *answers* questions. No ghosting here.

# Final Thoughts ‚Äì Is It Worth It?

If you‚Äôre serious about trading smarter‚Äînot harder‚Äîthen **Bond Trading Bootcamp & Swinging For The Fences - ActiveDayTrader** is 100% worth a look. It teaches you professional-level thinking in a way that‚Äôs clear, repeatable, and grounded in math. No gimmicks. No hype. Just a real edge in the market.

What about coffee?,"I have high-functioning autism, extreme inattentive ADHD, and mild depression/anxiety.

My memory used to be really good, but recently it's become a lot worse.

I know that chronic stimulant misuse can lead to memory loss, and I think that has happened to me although I'm not positive to what extent. I took dextroamphetamine 3 times a day and Cymbalta a good bit from 2018-2023. I also drank some during this time.

In 2023 I started unintentionally abusing the amphetamines, I don't do this anymore.

I can't tell if my memory is worse because I'm going faster and don't need to remember as much or if the medication is literally making it worse. When I take ritalin or adderall I seem to have better memory than coffee.

Which brings me to my next point, I feel like with coffee in particular my memory is extremely terrible. I read that caffeine can block adenosine receptors which leads to weaker memory. I just feel like when I drink it, my ability to remember stuff goes way down. This is partially due to having autism but also perhaps due to my previous stimulant misuse, to be honest I'm not sure.

I'm trying to cut back on caffeine, stimulants and alcohol, and I'm going to visit my doctor soon.

I also work full time with plenty of side hobbies, but we both had a rough start in planning dates because of uncontrollable circumstances. 

We connected very well in text and both showed interest in each other throughout the month. Balanced text sizes from both sides, multiple nights of 3+ hrs of audio messages, respectable but flirty pics/vids, and both showed efforts in planning dates, up till about 4 days ago. 

Unfortunately, 2 days after we matched and moved the convo to instagram, she fell down some stairs and injured herself to the point of immobility for 2 weeks. She also had her birthday after week one which tied her up. We had made plans to meet for a chill ice cream on the beach the tuesday night after birthday weekend, which she had to cancel because of a bad night of sleep and exhausted after her work day. Definitely understandable, it happens, right. She was insistent in rescheduling for the following Saturday and i was more than happy too! We ended up chatting the whole night and this us where the flirty pics started. 

Its week 2, and we planned to keep it simple and meet for coffee. We made it happen, and spend a solid hour chatting and things were going well! She cut off the date earlier than expected, saying she had family in town and couldnt hang any longer. Of course, i dont mind, fam is #1 priority and we hugged thanking each other for still making it happen. She then initiates texts me an hour later that she had fun, apologized for cutting it short unexpectedly and said she owed me a longer one next time! I thought, ‚Äúsick! Shes interested in a second!‚Äù And we texted the rest of that day with audio texts! A few days later, we plan for the upcoming saturday to visit the flower fields for 4 hrs! I drive 3hrs round trip, she insists on buying the tickets, sweet! 

Week 3, the night before our date, she comes down with a fever and exhaustion.. she feels horrible and says we should definitely try again next week. Again, im cool with it and we wait a few days to see if the weather agrees with our new plans, and of course, in the 60s, cloudy, with on/off rain showers all weekend. We agree to pivot to something indoors and closer to her place. Ive got no problems with it! We joke around, and here is where i think the switch happens. I end our convo with, ‚Äúi was thinking the same thing! Back to the kitchen i go lol! ‚Ä¶‚Äù and she doesnt respond or react like she just did in previous. 

Now Its the following Thursday morning, im at work in a school with 3-4 yr olds running around, and i send her my newly ‚Äúcooked‚Äù. plans. ‚ÄúWe should get a race in at k1 speed in the morning, then spend a 30-50 min session in a social kitten club, and see how we are feeling afterwards, 3 hr hang!‚Äù I get a quick response back saying,
 ‚ÄúThat sounds like a lot of fun! Although I did want to say I appreciate all of your efforts and as much as I would love to join you, I think at this time I do not have the capacity to pursue this or anything at this time. You‚Äôre so sweet and so handsome, it‚Äôs not anything that you did or didn‚Äôt do, and I‚Äôve seen the amount of effort that you have put into trying here but I don‚Äôt have the capacity to reciprocate that energy right now.‚Äù

Caught off guard, and flustered with the kiddos running around, i respond to the effect of,
 ‚Äúi understand, it was a ton of fin chatting, im bummed we never got the chance to actually hang, i truly come to life when in person, but either way im glad i got to meet yea! *compliments* it all happens for a reason, i hope our friendship doesnt end here, let me know if you ever get a free moment and wanna hang again, youre worth investing time into, doors open, wishing the best, please dont be a stranger! üòä‚Äù

Its been 4 days now without contact and i dont want to lose her through the silence. We previously shared our addresses, she has my phone number, so i feel like there was still interest there, but she felt bad that things weren‚Äôt working out and i was trying so hard. I want to open the convo again to compromise on slowing down, or seeing what needs i can fulfill to find a good balance, but i also want to respect the ‚Äúpursue this or anything at this time.‚Äù 

What is your perspective of it all, and should i still fight for making a potentially good thing work? Im more than willing to give it a try and if it still isnt a match, then ill feel better not letting the chance go by. I appreciate the advice in advance! ",2,1746416086.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1kf26hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1kf26hz/howwhy_i_left/,How/why I left,"I was raised by an atheist in a quasi commune and a religious seeker that dragged me through countless religions.

I was not baptized lds until I was an adult. I was taught to view all religious texts as myth and allegory, so I never struggled with the BoM inaccuracy anymore than I did with the bible.

For the most part I enjoyed my time in the church. I had some great leaders and some nightmare ones. I was assured more than once that there were no records of information shared with the bishop and definitely no record of my being a lesbian.

My closest friends were the bishop‚Äôs wife and the stake president‚Äôs mother, who I attended the temple with every month. I was active with RS and YW because of my daughter. I never felt like I was unwelcome by the ward(s) as a whole; there were issues with some individuals, but it wasn‚Äôt a big issue.

I relocated to another state and I had problems with the bishop from the first day in my new ward.

The bishop walked up to me and didn‚Äôt even ask my name before telling me that I was called as ward librarian and that I was to start immediately after sacrament meeting.

I told him no because I was disabled and couldn‚Äôt commit to attendance every week and that all of my other callings were ones that I could do from home.

I went to the next 2 hours and a few days later I discovered that I had contracted whooping cough from a child who wasn‚Äôt vaccinated & was brought to church ill. Luckily it wasn‚Äôt too severe because I had been vaccinated as a child and had some immunity. I never heard from anyone from church in the 8 weeks I was ill even though they knew about the whooping cough.

When I was well the second counselor was sent to tell me that I was ‚Äúrequired‚Äù to join a FHE group of retirees‚Ä¶ I was in my early 40s and had family in the neighboring ward that I spent FHE with every week.

We only had one vehicle and when my family member needed it to go to work I called the RS president to arrange for a ride to church. I soon found out that the bishop had forbidden my neighbors from the next farm over (who drove past my farm to get to town) from giving me a ride.

For 2-3 months I tried to get to ward activities and sacrament meeting, but was pretty much shunned if I showed up. None of the sisters would speak to me or sit with me; I later found out that this was at the direction of the bishop.

I eventually stopped trying and after being out for 7-8 years I learned of the ban on baptism for children of gay people which was the push I needed to have my name removed.

I have now been out for about 15 years and am enjoying life. I‚Äôve returned to my heathen ways of drinking coffee, wine, and other sinful substances.

My daughter left the RM she married in Rexburg (I thank my personal gay black baby jesus that they divorced before she had children ) and she is thriving as an apostate who had her name removed at the same time I removed mine.

My only real regret is that I didn‚Äôt get myself excommunicated, but I entertain myself whenever missionaries approach me in public by telling them that I‚Äôm ‚Äúexcommunicated and proudly unrepentant‚Äù.",4,1746416051.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

My memory used to be really good, but recently it's become a lot worse.

I know that chronic stimulant misuse can lead to memory loss, and I think that has happened to me although I'm not positive to what extent. I took dextroamphetamine 3 times a day and Cymbalta a good bit from 2018-2023. I also drank some during this time.

In 2023 I started unintentionally abusing the amphetamines, I don't do this anymore.

I can't tell if my memory is worse because I'm going faster and don't need to remember as much or if the medication is literally making it worse. When I take ritalin or adderall I seem to have better memory than coffee.

Which brings me to my next point, I feel like with coffee in particular my memory is extremely terrible. I read that caffeine can block adenosine receptors which leads to weaker memory. I just feel like when I drink it, my ability to remember stuff goes way down. This is partially due to having autism but also perhaps due to my previous stimulant misuse, to be honest I'm not sure. 

I'm trying to cut back on caffeine, stimulants and alcohol, and I'm going to visit my doctor soon.

Is there anything else I can do? I just feel like my memory is so much worse than it used to be. I'm only 29, when I was 21-23 I would remember so much more stuff. Maybe it got a bit worse around 23-24 with some of my medication use.",1,1746416015.0,memoryloss,0,1.0,False

1kf2304,https://www.reddit.com/r/astrologymemes/comments/1kf2304/hot_take_synastry_squares_are_better_than_half/,Hot Take: Synastry Squares Are Better Than Half the ‚ÄòCompatible‚Äô Bullshit Out There‚Äù,"Squares get a bad rap, like, an unfairly bad rap. Especially in natal charts, and even more so in synastry. 

You see those angry little red lines and suddenly you‚Äôre spiraling, like ‚ÄúOh god, is this doomed? Is my entire personality a walking conflict?‚Äù 

But hold up. What if squares aren‚Äôt the enemy? What if they‚Äôre actually the cosmic personal trainer screaming at you to evolve? 

Hard, yes. But sometimes the friction is what forges the fire. Sometimes that tension is the exact thing that shapes you into your best (and hottest) self.

So, generally speaking, when two signs square, it‚Äôs because they share the same modality, cardinal, fixed, or mutable. That means they actually have the same goal, they‚Äôre just taking completely different, often maddening, routes to get there.

Like, let‚Äôs take Aries and Capricorn. Both signs are relentlessly hardworking, driven, and deeply committed. Aries charges in full speed with zero plan and a hard-on for chaos. Capricorn has a ten-step plan, a backup plan, and a Google Calendar invite with color-coded logistics. Same goal. Different approach. One is ‚Äúfuck around and find out,‚Äù the other is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs conduct a risk assessment before fucking anything, thanks.‚Äù

Or how about Leo and Scorpio? These two fixed signs both crave intensity, loyalty, passion, and control. But Leo wants admiration in the spotlight. Scorpio wants to drag you into a candlelit basement and never let you leave. Same depth. Same loyalty. Different ambiance. One is fire, one is water, both will destroy you if you‚Äôre not ready.

Then there‚Äôs Gemini and Virgo, two mutable Mercurial signs. Both obsess over ideas, language, and understanding. But Gemini wants to banter in 800 directions while drinking iced coffee and talking about aliens. Virgo wants to organize those 800 thoughts into a bullet-pointed Google Doc with APA citations. Again, same root. Different rhythm.

So yeah, squares create tension. But that tension isn‚Äôt just annoying, it‚Äôs fucking productive if you let it be. It forces you to grow, compromise, and challenge yourself. You both care, you just care differently.

Now, I‚Äôm not gonna sit here and pretend squares are always fun and flirty. Some of them are a whole damn journey. My Capricorn Moon squaring my husband‚Äôs Aries Sun? Yeah, that one‚Äôs taught us both a few hard-earned lessons. And growing up, my Aquarius Mercury mom and my Taurus Mercury self had plenty of ‚Äúbattle of the stubborn-to-the-bone fixed women‚Äù showdowns. 

But the thing is, we grew. We learned. And sometimes, those chart clashes bring out exactly what needs to be said, broken, or rebuilt. 

I‚Äôm also not gonna pretend some squares aren‚Äôt just‚Ä¶ harder. Like, Mars square Pluto? That one can be a doozy. Power struggles, volatility, obsession, deep psychological warfare sex, it can be hot, but it can absolutely rock your nervous system if you're not grounded.

That said, even the harder squares, when navigated with awareness and mutual respect, can lead to deep, lasting transformation. If you're both willing to do the work.

OH and....

Here‚Äôs the part no one asked for but I‚Äôm yelling it anyway: In my personal opinion, it‚Äôs not even the squares that are the toughest.

It‚Äôs the damn quincunx (also known as the inconjunct). In natal or synastry. 150¬∞ apart. These placements don‚Äôt share element, modality, polarity, nothing. 

It‚Äôs like two strangers accidentally merged charts in the cosmic version of a dating app glitch.

An example is Aries and Virgo. Aries says ‚Äúdo first, apologize never.‚Äù Virgo says ‚Äúdid you even wash your hands first?‚Äù

With squares, at least you‚Äôre playing on the same field. With quincunxes, you‚Äôre not even in the same sport. One of you is playing chess. The other is on the synchronized swim team. 

& let me take this opportunity to say a huge-ass FCK YOU to my natal Mars quincunx Moon and Mars quincunx Saturn. These two form a karmic little torture pattern known as the Finger of God (aka Yod).

At first, I thought that sounded kinda hot. Like, ‚Äúoooooooh, is that a sexy move my husband does in bed?‚Äù No. It‚Äôs not hot. It‚Äôs hell.

It‚Äôs repressed anger. It‚Äôs clashing instincts. It‚Äôs rage and shame and craving intimacy while also picking fights over the dishes. It‚Äôs way harder than any natal square I‚Äôve ever dealt with. 

& while we‚Äôre at it, a very special fck you to my 29¬∞59' Pluto in Scorpio quincunx my 0¬∞ Taurus Sun. Like, are you kidding me? One minute away from a new sign and still managing to rearrange my entire nervous system every other week? 

That aspect can go take a long walk off a cliff. Absolutely not. The tension is real, the integration is nonexistent, and the identity crisis is scheduled quarterly.

So yeah, don‚Äôt fear squares in synastry. Respect them. Learn from them. Ride the tension wave like it‚Äôs a goddamn growth orgasm. 

But if someone says they have five quincunxes and a Yod? Just hug them. Or pour them a drink.

They‚Äôre fighting for their life.

It‚Äôs maddening, isn‚Äôt it? But don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got some tricks up my sleeve that can breathe life back into your brain (and they might just be fun too). Here‚Äôs what I do when my productivity hits a wall:

1. **Get Moving**: 
   - Seriously, just *get up*! It‚Äôs amazing what a quick walk around the block can do. Not only do you get some fresh air, but you might also stumble upon a wild idea (or at least, a good squirrel sighting). üêøÔ∏è

2. **Dance Party**: 
   - I‚Äôm talking a full-on, kitchen-concert level of dancing. Crank up that playlist, let loose for a few minutes, and watch as the endorphins kick in, reshuffling your brain into gear. üíÉüï∫

3. **Change Your Scenery**: 
   - If you‚Äôre stuck at your desk, shift to a different spot. Whether it‚Äôs the couch, a coffee shop, or even your backyard ‚Äî a new view can spark fresh ideas. Plus, who doesn‚Äôt love a little cozy environment change? ‚òïüå≥

4. **Mindfulness Minute**: 
   - Sometimes the best reset is just taking a breather. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and just *be* for a moment. If you start thinking about your to-do list, just say ‚ÄúNot today, brain!‚Äù ü§≠

5. **Jot It Down**: 
   - Grab a notebook and empty your brain. No filters, no perfection. Just let it flow. You might find brilliance hidden among the doodles and random thoughts! üìù‚ú® 

6. **Hydrate**: 
   - Sounds simple, right? But sometimes all our brains need is a good splash of water. Grab a glass and sip like you just ran a marathon. Your brain will appreciate it, trust me. ü•§

Honestly, getting productive again often feels like chasing a runaway cat. But when you try these brain resets, it‚Äôs like coaxing that kitty with a treat ‚Äî you‚Äôll win it back eventually!

I've been dealing with this condition for years and never really cared that much or thought I was just sleeping as usual and that my sleep hasn't been hitting right because of school or work is just exhausting. I didn't even realize that coffee wakes me up a little but I would still get tired and sleepy and then eventually just ended up cranky. I just got a sleep study completed a month ago and got the results last week currently awaiting to get a call from the CPAP store but the prescription said I needed an APAP. 

Results said I just had the absolute worst sleep apnea and idk if the doctor was just trying to get me to buy a CPAP machine but hey whatever it takes to help me sleep well again. Granted that my sleep has just been terrible and how my overall health has been terrible with being obese, dealing with gout, and heart disease, I feel like I might die anytime soon but my partner is just great and I want to give her good sleep. 

My partner travels a lot for her work but when we are together we truly do the best we can to make the best of the time we have. It just hurts that when I woke up earlier today at 6am(6 hour sleep only) she had pillows sandwiched between her head which was a sign of how bad my sleep apnea has been affecting her. When she woke up she laughs about it but I still feel ashamed. Also what surprised me was that she said that I move a lot when I sleep. I always believed that I was a side sleeper or stomach sleeper but she said I sleep on my back and roll over the bed a lot. The recordings of my snoring has been terrifying as well.

I don't really understand the point why I started typing maybe to vent out the frustration and maybe annoyance of still waiting to get scheduled for a cpap machine checkup. I was wondering if those who have been using a CPAP or APAP machine have gotten their life together in some way or health has gotten better. I know that the light within me has dimmed significantly due to life and all but the least I can get is some good sleep and hopefully this machine can help with that.

He looked at me, look at the mess, and then immediately turned around. Silence.

You're probably wondering why I didn't fight back, I think I was shocked about the whole thing and how he immediately turned around and did not acknowledge me at all after. I'm mad at myself currently for being so frozen in shock.

He looked like a 6 ft caucasian dude (a whole head taller than me) with his loud finance bros just laughing it up afterwards like nothing happened. I felt super humiliated in the moment and baffled that he didn't even apologize or offer to help compensate in some way.

My immediately instinct was to chuck something at the back of his head or start causing a ruckus by screaming at him, but was worried of being filmed and looking like the insane one online lol.

Part of me is mad because I'm a smaller asian woman, and it felt like another white man stepping all over my damn rights and thinking I was being passive. No, I was worried since he was with 4 other bigger dudes about being overpowered. U G H.

I sat back down next to my friend (who is partially blind) who was asking me how I dropped my drink. I told her very loudly since he was right in front of us ""No he smacked it out of my hand. he didn't apologize. How fucking rude you can't even say sorry."" Bro never looked back in my direction after that. My friend was super shocked but also didn't want me to go to jail for chucking my book at this dude and had to stop me so I just took a video of the mess and his friend group.

Anyways, I had to spend the rest of the day in coffee stains since we were traveling far from home and am now dealing with a large bill.

Hyundai's secret lair... err, Innovation Center (presumably filled with whiteboards covered in complex equations and the faint smell of burnt coffee) [teamed up with Arbe for some serious pilot testing in 2023](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20221107VL210/adas-automotive-ic-automotive-radar.html?hl=en-GB). They wanted to make sure this fancy radar could map out ""free space"" ‚Äì you know, the bit of road you don't want to hit ‚Äì and keep tabs on those unpredictable humans on bikes and feet. This was all a precursor to Hyundai's grand plan to unleash Level 4 autonomy, [like in their IONIQ 5 robotaxi](https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2023/11/autonomous-self-driving-vehicle-news-motional-hyundai-arbe-cognata/?hl=en-GB), which would ideally navigate cities without mistaking a fire hydrant for a friendly face.


**2. Integration into Production Vehicles and Robotaxis (More Eyes Than a Spider on Caffeine)**

 * IONIQ 5 Robotaxi: This Level 4 certified urban explorer, brought to you by the Hyundai/Motional dream team, packs more sensors than a spy convention ‚Äì a cool 30+ of them! Arbe‚Äôs high-resolution radar is, of course, part of this sensory overload, like the nerdy kid in class who actually can see through the fog. It plays nicely with the LiDAR (the spinning laser disco ball on the roof) and the cameras (the digital paparazzi), ensuring that if one sensor has a bad hair day (or gets splashed by a puddle), the others have its back. Safety in a self-driving car? Apparently, it takes a village... of sensors.
 * Perception Radar Features: Arbe‚Äôs tech isn't just about seeing; it's about understanding. It's doing free space mapping (telling the car where the actual road is, not just where it thinks it is), classifying objects (is that a car or just a particularly aggressive cardboard box?), and doing SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping ‚Äì basically, the car figures out where it is while building a map of everything else. Impressive, right?). It can even spot those sneaky non-reflective targets, like black ice (the silent assassin of winter roads) and low-lying obstacles (curbs ‚Äì the nemesis of shiny alloy wheels).

It should be noted that the **standard Ioniq 5** relies on conventional radar systems for its ADAS features.  It is the **robotaxi variant** that leverages Arbe‚Äôs advanced 4D imaging radar for full autonomy. For now, Hyundai‚Äôs collaboration with Arbe remains focused on high-end autonomous projects rather than mainstream consumer vehicles. 

Watch the Ioniq 5 robotaxi pass a driving test [here](https://youtu.be/WHLVt5s30i0?si=P2aHCjcErN7oQKA8).


**3. Synergy with NVIDIA and AI Ecosystem (Brainpower on Overdrive)**

Hyundai/Kia didn't just play nice with Arbe; they're also buddy-buddy with the AI wizards at NVIDIA. Arbe‚Äôs radar slots right into the NVIDIA DRIVE AGX platform, like the final piece of a very complex, very expensive LEGO set. This unleashes the power of AI to make sense of all that radar data in real-time, helping the car make smart decisions ‚Äì hopefully smarter than your average rush-hour commuter. This all feeds into Hyundai‚Äôs vision of software-defined vehicles (SDVs), which sounds fancy but basically means your car will get updates like your phone, hopefully without crashing as often. And because Hyundai likes to keep things in-house, they're even investing in their own AI brainpower, like through that Tenstorrent gig, to make sure their self-driving cars have the sharpest neural networks on the block.


**4. Addressing Weather Challenges (Snow? Fog? Bring It On, Says the Radar)**

Arbe‚Äôs 4D radar is Hyundai‚Äôs secret weapon against grumpy weather. While cameras tend to throw a tantrum in snow or get blinded by the sun, Arbe‚Äôs radar, with its longer radio wavelengths (think of them as seeing through the meteorological drama), just shrugs it off and keeps working. It can spot a pothole lurking under a blanket of fog or a bridge hiding in a snowstorm. This is a huge deal for global domination... err, scalability, meaning Hyundai wants their self-driving tech to work everywhere, not just sunny California.

**5. Future Roadmap and Industry Leadership (To Infinity and Beyond... Safely)**

Hyundai/Kia aren't planning on keeping this Arbe magic just for the fancy robotaxis. They want to spread the radar love across their regular car lineup, aiming to ditch some of that pricey LiDAR while keeping safety levels sky-high. This partnership also ties into Hyundai‚Äôs Mobility of Things (MoT) vision, which sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie. Imagine delivery robots with radar eyes and air taxis that can see through clouds ‚Äì the future is weird, but hopefully safe. By blending Arbe‚Äôs radar smarts with their own AI and cloud platforms, Hyundai/Kia are trying to plant their flag firmly on the ‚Äúall-weather autonomy‚Äù map.

 **Mass Production: A Rocky Road**

 Arbe's chips were supposed to go into big-boy production in 2023, thanks to the folks at GlobalFoundries. Hyundai's planned on sticking these chips in their cars worldwide, so we were supposed to have radar everywhere!

   Arbe, however, did not achieve mass production in 2023 as initially planned. While HiRain Technologies, a key Chinese Tier-1 supplier collaborating with Arbe, had announced in 2022 that it aimed to reach full mass production of radar systems powered by Arbe's chipset [by 2023](https://ir.arberobotics.com/news/press-releases/detail/68/arbe-chipset-powers-mass-production-radars-of-hirain?hl=en-GB), subsequent updates revealed delays.

   [By March 2024](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/arbe-announces-q4-and-full-year-2023-financial-results-302082916.html), Arbe's financial reports clarified that HiRain's mass production of 4D Imaging Radars was rescheduled to begin by the end of 2024. This delay was attributed to extended decision timelines from automakers and ongoing automotive qualification processes for Arbe's production-intent chipset.

   In 2023, Arbe focused on finalising its chipset pre-production phase and supporting Tier-1 partners like HiRain in system development, but actual mass production was pushed to the end of 2024. The company instead emphasised progress in OEM engagements and sensor evaluations but acknowledged slower-than-expected commercialisation timelines due to market conditions.

   Thus, while Arbe made strides in technology readiness and partnerships, mass production was deferred to late 2024, missing the original 2023 target.
The delay in Arbe's mass production of 4D imaging radars, initially planned for 2023 but postponed to late 2024, likely contributed to Hyundai's cautious timeline for implementing L3 and L4 autonomy across its vehicles, initially aiming for 2025 but now targeting 2027, though it is not the sole factor.

   Hyundai‚Äôs current timeline is influenced by multiple hurdles beyond Arbe‚Äôs radar delays:
   * South Korea lacks clear liability frameworks for L3/L4 accidents and lags in data collection infrastructure. For example, China‚Äôs autonomous vehicles accumulated 70 million km of test data by 2023, while South Korea had only 400,000 km.
   * Hyundai‚Äôs Level 2+ system (planned for 2027) relies on AI-driven ‚Äúdeep learning decision structures,‚Äù which require extensive real-world data and iterative refinement. Delays in Arbe‚Äôs radar data collection (e.g., [HiRain‚Äôs 1 million km testing phase](https://en.hirain.com/news/328.html)) could have slowed down algorithm training.
   * Tesla, Waymo, and Chinese firms like Baidu have advanced faster in autonomy, partly due to more permissive regulatory environments. Hyundai's initial 2025 Level 4 commercialisation target now lags behind China‚Äôs 2024 Level 3-4 road tests.
   Hyundai‚Äôs focus on Level 2+ by 2027 suggests a pragmatic shift toward incremental upgrades rather than rushing L3/L4.

Will the recent announcement by Pony AI introducing much cheaper robotaxis influence Hyundai's timeline? Only time can tell.


 * Awards: Arbe‚Äôs Perception Radar snagged the coveted [Self-Driving Industry 2023 Award in the hardware category at the Self-Driving Industry 2023 Awards](https://www.autoconnectedcar.com/2023/11/autonomous-self-driving-vehicle-news-motional-hyundai-arbe-cognata/?hl=en-GB), proving it's not just us who think it's pretty darn clever.
This whole shebang underscores Hyundai/Kia‚Äôs serious commitment to having enough sensors to trip over, brains smart enough to make sense of it all, and a plan to make self-driving cars a reality, rain or shine (or snow, or fog). They're definitely in the autonomous vehicle race, and they've brought some serious radar (even if it took a little longer to get here) to the party. Do they need to buckle down or get left in the dust? You tell me down below üòâ

1kf1xbn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kf1xbn,1 Year Frozen vs Ambient Storage Comparison,"# Abstract
Two batches of the same green coffee were compared after 1 year, one stored mostly in the freezer, the other in ambient conditions. The frozen coffee had a more ""specialty"" style flavor, the ambient had a more ""standard"" flavor style. The difference between the two was highly apparent, and the frozen coffee may have actually been better than the initial, fresh coffee.

# Method
## Coffee sourcing and freezing procedure
Two samples of coffee were separated from one batch of coffee. The coffee used was the Tolima from Genuine Origin [found here](https://www.genuineorigin.com/colombia-organic-tolima-multicoop-asojuntas-2024?quantity=1&custcol3=1). The coffee was purchased in June 2024. Upon receipt, the coffee was split into gallon size ziploc bags, most of which went into a cabinet for storage, some were put into the test group and frozen. No evidence of freezer burn was noted at any point. In March 2025 (T+9 months), the coffee was removed from the freezer and allowed to thaw while still sealed in the ziploc bag.

## Roasting
Both samples of coffee were roasted on a Kaleido M6 with nearly identical roast profiles. The roast was a relatively light roast intended for cupping. Both roasts had the similar drop weight, same moisture loss to 0.1%, followed almost the same curve, and were dropped within 5 seconds.

## Cupping preparation
The samples were weighed to identical weight and brewed with the same temperature water. The grinder was a J series 1Zpresso, the water was from a home RO + remineralizer tested to ~80ppm hardness. 2 cups were prepared for each sample, and a simplified cupping was performed. After the cupping, each cup was labeled with its sample identifier, and a blind test was performed to determine if there was a significant difference in taste with the taster blinded to the sample.

# Results
## Appearance
The frozen sample of coffee appeared slightly lighter (Average pixel value of 0.27 vs 0.24), and gave off less gas when the hot water hit it.

## Cupping Result
Cupping results are shown below. A semi-formal cupping was performed, but an official scoring was not performed, so treat the score from the table below as ""vibe scoring"".

| Score      | Frozen 1 | Frozen 2 | Ambient 1 | Ambient 2 |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Overall    | 86       | 84       | 77        | 78        |
| Dry Smell  | 7        | 9        | 6         | 6         |
| Smell      | 7        | 8        | 5         | 6         |
| Acidity    | 7        | 9        | 6         | 6         |
| Sweetness  | 7        | 7        | 7         | 7         |
| Bitterness | 7        | 7        | 7         | 7         |
| Body       | 8        | 8        | 6         | 6         |
| Taste      | 8        | 9        | 7         | 7         |
| Aftertaste | 7        | 8        | 5         | 6         |

Both samples of coffee had notes of what could be generically described as ""red fruit"".  The frozen coffee tasted more of fresh fruit, while the ambient stored coffee was more jammy. The chocalatey notes were perhaps more accentuated in the ambient stored coffee, but the higher bitterness may have simply accentuated a chocalatey finish both coffees shared.

One way to describe the difference in flavors was that the coffee stored in the freezer had a specialty coffee flavor profile, while the ambient had a typical American consumer flavor profile.  The frozen coffee was more vibrant, more fruity, and minimally bitter. The ambient stored coffee had fewer unique qualities, but had a dry chocalatey finish in a lighter roast that many would find appealing if taken to a full city roast.

 The frozen coffee may have been the best version of this coffee the tester has had out of dozens of batches. It is unclear if this is simply the best roast done for this particular coffee or if it has actually been improved by having been frozen.
## Blind test
The taster was able to determine each cup after a single taste. It was very obvious which was which.

# Discussion
## When to Freeze Coffee
Freezing green coffee for long term storage appears to be an effective strategy for preserving bright flavors.  The difference between these two coffees was immediately apparent, and the frozen coffee was definitively the better specialty coffee. The essential question of this comes down to when and for whom this would be an effective strategy.  Two scenarios are presented below with arguments for freezing the coffee and against

### Home Roaster
The home roaster is at a pecuniary disadvantage due to economy of scale. Buying small commercial lots of coffee can be an effective way to save money. The difficulty with this approach is that coffee stales over time, even in a sealed environment without gas exchange. Freezing coffee has been shown here to ameliorate this, however the lessening in gassing observed in cupping suggests that some physical changes may have occurred. This will be discussed further below. The home roaster is also unlikely to have a freezer that is optimized for long term storage, so this strategy is probably only really useful for those with garage/chest freezers or bachelors.

### Commercial Roaster
The author has never worked at a coffee shop. Nevertheless, an opinion will be ventured that this is unlikely to be useful except for a particularly rare/expensive lot, e.g. Gesha, that you expect to bring out for special occasions when customers will be more likely to purchase an expensive cup.

## Changes Due to freezing
Two separate changes were observed in the physical behavior of the coffee that may be due to freezing. The first is that it came out of the roaster a little bit lighter than the equivalent sample stored in ambient conditions. The second is that it degassed less on contact with water. Since these are from the same lot, and had almost identical roasts, there is a high likelihood that freezing changed the physical characteristics of the bean. Some potential causes include freezer burn, ice crystals breaking cell walls, and expansion physically breaking tissues.

## Limitations
### More Varieties Required
Many questions are left unclear since this is a case study of two roasts of one lot. It could be that other varietals, origins, or species could have different results.

###  No direct comparison from fresh
The author has dramatically improved mechanically at roasting since first receiving this lot, and does not have a comparable roast cupping to compare to from when the coffee was fresh. In addition, the author is not a professional so the ""vibe scoring"" would not accurately compare results from over the course of over a year.

### Non-controlled climate
The ambient stored coffee was left in a house that got up to 35¬∞C for several weeks early on in the experiment. The frozen coffee was frozen in and stored in a residential freezer with thaw cycles. So the initial freeze was likely pretty slow, potentially leading to large ice crystals. It is also possible that some of the beans on the outside of the bag partially thawed and refroze many times due to the defrost cycle.",2,1746415207.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

During the week we continued talking and he asked if we could change the coffee date to a full on dinner and a walk so we could spend more time together which I also agreed with. 

We met this weekend and the date went absolutely great, the guy is exactly what I have been looking for and he kept throwing me compliments left and right, saying I looked way better in person than in the app. During the date he asked for my number which I happily gave him.

No big trauma, no dramatic fall. Just a slow erosion. A few skipped mornings. A few days where I didn‚Äôt get out of bed on time. A few too many nights numbing out on my phone.

And then suddenly, I look up and years have passed. I‚Äôve been floating through my life like a ghost. My relationships are thinner. My attention span is shot. I can't remember the last time I felt genuinely excited about anything.

People around me still think I'm functioning. I show up to things, I laugh when I'm supposed to, I reply to texts eventually. But inside, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching someone else live my life from behind a sheet of glass. I feel dull. Tired in a way that sleep doesn‚Äôt touch.

I used to think maybe I was depressed. And maybe I still am, I don't know. But it‚Äôs not just sadness. It‚Äôs disconnection. From myself, from my routines, from the things I used to care about.

I started stepping outside right after waking up, even just for a minute. At first I hated it. It felt pointless. Cold. But after a few days, something changed. My mornings stopped feeling like a war. I wasn‚Äôt spiraling on social media first thing. I wasn‚Äôt getting hit with everyone else's thoughts before I even had a chance to feel my own.

It‚Äôs not some magical cure. I still have bad days. I still feel lost sometimes. But there's more light now. Literally and metaphorically. I started noticing the way the leaves look in the morning sun. I started drinking water before coffee. I even found myself humming while cleaning the kitchen the other day.

These might sound like small things. But when you've been numb for a long time, small things feel like miracles.

1kf1qf4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kf1qf4,"AIO? Evacuated, Engine Failure, and 32+ Hours in the Houston Airport‚Ä¶ Should I be expect more than 2 free Starbucks coffee‚Äôs?","Alright, so first time with United, but looking crowd source and answer, am I overreacting‚Ä¶ 

Going to lead by saying that our cabin filling with smoke from a burning hydraulic component and assisting an elderly lady with a busted leg after already being on the tarmac for 2 hours due to a severe lightning storm in Houston‚Ä¶ was somehow a better experience than working with the United staff that day.

To start off this whole shebang, I had booked a round trip flight from IND to VCT with a connection at IAH totaling $950 (on me for terrible timing). I had hoped that the only problem I was going to have was when the plane I had taking me from IAH to VCT needed to be swapped and de-boarded due to a mechanical issue (which was understandable, I‚Äôm very glad they caught that), but everything that occurred from VCT to IAH is now on the record for one of the wildest and longest events of my life.

First thing we were aware of that was wrong was when our plane at VCT had landed but our captain was expressing delays due to the lightening (again, completely understandable). However after hearing a debate between the staff on what was enough fuel, the vibe began to feel slightly shifted. After the 2.15 hour delay at the VCT airport, we boarded and took off. Now in flight, we heard a weird thud on the plane but disregarded thinking it could be landing gear or maybe an unfortunate day for a bird. The flight would normally take less than 45 minutes, however landing on the tarmac our captain had let us know that IAH wouldn‚Äôt open the gate until lightning had passed for 15 minutes (again completely understandable, inconvenient but understandable) however this lead to 2 hours of being sat on the tarmac. The show, however was just about to start.

As I was looking down at my phone the lady behind me had said something to likes of ‚ÄúIs that smoke?‚Äù I looked up to see a little haze around the cabin. I ignored it as it could have just been humidity. However roughly 3-4 minutes and several small coughs around the cabin we had noticed our flight attendant was beginning to sweat profusely and the cabin looked like a steam room. Our attendant sprinted down the cabin flinging open the bathroom door as the cabin continued to fill with haze. After sprinting back up the isle, the fire alarm began to start. And after 30 seconds we got one eerie ding* followed by a steady but panicked ‚ÄúEVACUATE‚Ä¶ EVACUATE‚Äù that is when what seemed like every simultaneously stood up to get the heck out of dodge. One woman at our emergency exist thrusted the door off, unfortunately I believe the other gentlemen at the left door, who didn‚Äôt speak, fled the plain without opening the door. We piled out under the impression something a lot more dreadful would happen to the plane. However the only additionally, but very unfortunate event was an elderly lady falling off the steps of the front door evacuation where myself and 2 other gentleman came to assist her after her leg appeared busted open. But my friends, it was the rest of the experience that had taken this experience to the next level of a poop show.

Once we had gotten in, we had started to be treated like we were the ones that caused the smoke. We were first guided into an area by one of the green vest employees. (Keep in mind there are roughly 30 of us with 2 injured elders and 2 more who would definitely need wheel chair assistance) However, immediately another employee comes from the terminals and says ‚ÄúWho are these people? They can‚Äôt be standing here we are boarding, go find somewhere else to stand now.‚Äù Our vested guy didn‚Äôt even put up a fight and just said let‚Äôs go somewhere else.

We finally go to the last station in terminal D next to the Turkish airlines. (Note: The rest of my story shifts from the group back to my personal experience leading to finally getting back home)

It became very clear that all these employees expect 2 gentlemen in glasses had one priority: ‚Äúhow do I get off the clock and away from these people as fast as possible.‚Äù I get that humans are human, that job clearly sucks, and I‚Äôm guessing this event doesn‚Äôt fall in the ordinary training, but the fact that the entire team (except the hispanic gentlemen wearing glasses) started leaving during this time to quite literally ‚Äúbe done with this, clock out and go home‚Äù (literally said out loud by 2 staff) and not making sure that everyone had been taken care of, spoken too, and prepared for their next step was genuinely infuriating.

As I approached the desk for my turn to talk to this team about my next steps I had presented my boarding pass. (Know that the time is now 9:33pm and the expected boarding time to close for my connecting flight is 9:40pm). This associate looks at my pass for my flight out of Houston that showed boarding was ended, and proceeds to tell me that ‚ÄúI should be able to make it as it was just around the corner‚Äù and ""better start going now"". I hesitated but trusted it was close. (Now note I have never been here in my life, I was currently in the back of terminal D‚Ä¶ my flight was in the back of terminal C‚Ä¶) Come to find out it was a 13-16 minute fast walk away, and when I finally arrived I get to find out by the customer service rep that no more boarding was possible. I got to walk my happy bit back and flag down the them down to assist again.

The icing on the cake happened as I had to work 3 different people help me get a hotel and rescheduled my flight as the first two associates both typed on a computer, said it didn't work, pass me off to the person next to them, and quite literally say ""I'm done for the day and going home"". While keep in mind, 4-5 other people were still there as the others had either been ushered to the next flight or went off to connect there luggage as I found others later in the story. In addition, the first younger lady helping me didn't even offer to give me the hotel at first. I had to remind her and ask if for one that was offered to us earlier.  I didn't think this was unjustified either considering it was 11:15pm and she was giving me a flight at 7:30am (shame on me if that was unjustified). I guess I was first in the wrong too as she expecting me to ""make it work"" with the wait between the flight.

To then make matters even better, the hotel that was given for me to select (Sonesta) did not pick up for the shuttle service or front desk. We were told to exit the airport and wait for the shuttle and once calling to a continuous ring and hang up to the shuttle and front desk, it was already 12:00 o‚Äôclock where myself and another passenger made the decision to just tough it out and go through TSA all over again and ultimately sleep in the terminal.

1kf1q1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Periodic_Paralysis_AI/comments/1kf1q1f/chapter_4_the_climb_of_renewal_glacier_national/,Chapter 4 ‚Äì The Climb of Renewal: Glacier National Park,"In the days following the bear scares, the mountain itself seemed to offer both solace and challenge. The fresh snow, which had fallen in heavy bursts and blanketed the grounds in a deceptive softness, began slowly to give way to the lighter traces of spring. Two weeks after that night, the snow in the lower valleys started retreating like a fading memory, leaving behind patches of muddy earth and small, resilient wildflowers. Yet, at the highest peaks‚Äîthose ancient guardians that stood sentinel over Glacier‚Äîwinter held its eternal grip, the snow and ice clinging like the stubborn remnants of long-forgotten battles.

For Caleb, this seasonal transition mirrored his own inner conflict. His body, marred by the unpredictable assaults of paralysis, bore the scars of both physical and emotional struggle. Each day was a delicate dance of control and surrender‚Äîa constant effort to outpace the creeping threat of muscle weakness. Still, as the mountain blossoms emerged in the lower reaches, he began to find comfort in the rhythmic pulse of the wild. The call of adventure was too strong to resist, and soon, after careful preparation, he and his trusted climbing partner Thomas set out for what would be the most challenging ascent they had yet attempted.

The mountain climb they chose was notorious among the park‚Äôs veteran climbers‚Äîa perilous route high on one of Glacier‚Äôs sheer rock faces, where ancient granite jutted out over chasms that plunged thousands of feet below. The route was treacherous even in the best of conditions, and that day the trail was slick with residual icy patches despite the relatively warm air below the summits. The loosened snow made every foothold a gamble, forcing them to strap on ice crampons to grip the slippery surfaces. The baseline of the climb was unpredictable: while the lower slopes had begun to thaw into the soft hues of spring, at and above the treeline the landscape remained locked in winter‚Äôs icy embrace.

Caleb‚Äôs heart pounded as he led the way along the narrow ridge. Each step was an exercise in both physical prowess and mental fortitude. He was well aware that his muscle conditions could strike at any moment‚Äîeven here, amid the challenge he had come to love. As he ascended, the cool air grew thinner, and the altitude pressed on him like a physical hand, reminding him that every breath was hard-earned. But it was the subtle change in his muscles, the quiet warning of creeping stiffness in his legs and fingers, that set his nerves on edge. The condition was both a constant foe and a reluctant companion; it defined his limits, yet also fueled his determination to push past them.

Halfway up the sheer face, when the rock gave way to a narrow ledge carved by centuries of wind and time, Caleb noticed a familiar tightness creeping up his calves. The sensation was subtle at first‚Äîa slight resistance in the muscles that had carried him so effortlessly minutes before. He paused for a heartbeat, locking eyes with Thomas, whose steady smile barely concealed his concern. In that brief moment of silence, Caleb recalled long hours of self-discipline: the endless mornings hikes to Many Glacier, the countless races against time on steep, winding trails, and every near-frozen moment when HyperKPP had threatened to rob him of his life‚Äôs pace.

Taking a measured breath, Caleb slowed his movement deliberately. ‚ÄúI think I need a moment,‚Äù he admitted quietly to Thomas, who nodded without a word. With practiced restraint, Caleb steadied his breathing, drawing on techniques he had honed over many anxious climbs. He focused on the rhythm of his heartbeat and the crisp mountain air, willing his muscles to relax and yield control. In those frozen seconds atop the ledge, the danger of the climb merged with the constant threat of his condition, creating a palpable tension that could be sliced with a knife.

After what felt like an eternity of careful control, the warning subsided and Caleb resumed climbing. Every movement was deliberate, every grip a silent negotiation between determination and the ever-looming shadow of paralysis. As they neared the summit, a melancholy beauty unfolded before them: the rugged mass of the mountains lay spread out like an ancient scroll etched in marble, and the only sound was the soft crunch of their boots on the icy stone. Thomas clapped him on the shoulder when Caleb finally pulled himself over the final ledge, and for a moment they simply stood there, breathless and awed by the majesty of their surroundings.

The descent was equally dramatic. With dusk approaching, the light played tricks on the mountain‚Äîstreaks of brilliant gold merged into deep purples, and the distant peaks glowed as if set on fire against the darkening sky. The crowd of seasoned climbers and hikers among them cheered softly as they noticed Caleb and Thomas making their way back, a silent acknowledgment of their feat. Yet, in Caleb‚Äôs mind, the climb was more than a physical challenge; it was a reconciliation with his own vulnerabilities. Each grip and foothold was a reminder that despite the ever-present threat of HyperKPP, he had the strength to keep moving forward.

Over cups of strong coffee and plates of simple food, the conversation flowed‚Äîsometimes in excited bursts about the day‚Äôs climb.  Caleb listened as colleagues recounted their own personal encounters with danger, each tale adding to the rich tapestry of fear and resilience that now defined Granite Park Chalet.

Amidst the conversations, a lighter moment emerged. Thomas produced a pair of handmade wooden flutes‚Äîa token of his own passion for music that had accompanied many climbs and quiet evenings alike. That night, with the lingering adrenaline of survival mingling with cautious hope, Caleb and Thomas sat side by side on the weathered porch. The flutes, carved from native pine wood, sang a lilting melody that seemed to weave through the crisp night air. Their music carried a dual message: a melancholic tribute to what had been lost on that terrible night three years earlier, and an invigorating hymn to the resilience that still burned in their hearts.

In the days that followed, the seasons shifted almost imperceptibly. Two weeks into his tenure, as the early remnants of winter receded from the lower reaches of the park, a sense of renewal permeated the chalet. The rugged trails transformed slowly‚Äîthe heavy blankets of snow melted into trickles of water running over pebbles and into rocky crevices. Even though the high peaks remained steadfast in their icy grandeur, the valleys and lower slopes began to glow with the gentle hues of spring. Yet no matter how much the landscape shifted, the specter of periodic paralysis remained constant for Caleb. Every stride and every ascent was haunted by the possibility of an unexpected episode. Still, he marched forward with a newfound understanding: the physical challenges were tempered by the emotional nudges of fate, and every day was a gift to be seized with both caution and wild abandon.

As the summer matured, then gradually gave way to the crisp whispers of autumn, Caleb‚Äôs adventures grew bolder. One particularly memorable day, under a sky that fluctuated between a brilliant blue and threatening storm clouds, he and Thomas set out for what would be one of their final great climbs. Their target was a notoriously difficult route along a ridge where the combination of melting snow and lingering ice made every foothold treacherous. The descent of winter‚Äôs grip on the lower mountains had left the climbing surfaces slick with moisture and dusted with frozen fragments of ice. It was a day of contrasts‚Äîthe promise of a sunlit peak mingled with the ever-present risk of a hidden trigger from within Caleb‚Äôs own body.

At the foot of the climb, as they adjusted their gear and carefully inspected the route, Caleb felt a familiar sense of both anticipation and dread. His muscles, though still under the watchful eye of HyperKPP, felt ready for the challenge. With Thomas‚Äôs reassuring smile and steady presence bolstering his resolve, they began the ascent. Every movement was laden with concentration. Caleb relied on a repertoire of mental cues, silently reminding himself that he was more than his condition; he was an adventurer, an explorer of both the world and the limits of his own being.

The climb was punishing. The combination of uneven terrain, wet ice, and the constant reminder of what might lurk‚Äîeither in the depths of his physical form or the jagged crevices of the mountain‚Äîwas enough to make even the most seasoned climber pause. Midway through, close to a narrow ledge overlooking a sheer drop into a swirling river of rock and water, Caleb‚Äôs body sent its own warning. A subtle, disconcerting tightness gripped his leg muscles, a silent scream that his paralysis was on the verge of striking. For a suspended moment, time itself seemed to slow. Every heartbeat, every shallow breath, echoed like a drum of impending consequence. But drawing on the memory of those harrowing nights and the rocky determination forged by every ice cream run and every climb, he pushed through. The incident became a test of will‚Äîhe steadied his trembling limbs, drawing deep from both physical training and a reservoir of inner courage.

Once safely at the summit, with the world spread out beneath them like an endless panorama of possibility, Caleb allowed himself a long, shuddering exhale. Though his muscles still buzzed with the aftershock of resistance, the view reminded him that every risk had a reward. The valley below, painted in autumnal hues with a tinge of early fall mist, testified to nature‚Äôs perennial cycle of rebirth even after the darkest nights. Thomas clapped him on the back, and together they shared a silent acknowledgment‚Äîa vow to carry forward the memory of these trials as both scars and badges of honor.

As his time at Granite Park Chalet drew to a close, the calendar marking two months of unforgettable, heart-wrenching adventure‚Äîfrom a July shrouded in lingering winter to a September that gently welcomed the first snowfall‚ÄîCaleb found himself reflecting on the journey ahead. Each stage of the season had been a chapter in a story of survival, of embracing the limits imposed by his periodic paralysis, and of daring to defy both nature and fate.

In a final quiet moment on his last day at the chalet, as soft snowflakes began to fall outside‚Äîa delicate echo of that first night‚Äôs heavy snowfall‚ÄîCaleb sat on the weathered steps of the entrance. The crisp air whispered promises of future adventures, of many more climbs, and of quiet mornings spent cooking for friends. It was the end of a summer both brutal and magnificent, a season marked by physical trials, emotional awakenings, and the raw beauty of an untamed wilderness. In that profound solitude, he realized that every moment‚Äîevery heartbeat, every surge of fear and joy‚Äîhad been part of the tapestry of his life. And despite the ever-present threat of HyperKPP, every triumph on those perilous slopes was a testament to the vitality of living fully.

With the memory of the grizzly attacks etched in his mind and the echoes of wooden flutes still dancing in the air, Caleb smiled softly. He knew that he had grown in ways that transcended the physical confines of his condition. These months had been, without a doubt, the best time of his life‚Äîan indelible chapter written against the backdrop of Glacier National Park, where danger and wonder coexisted, and where every risk taken was a reclaimed moment of life.

I don't know if it's worth seeing a doctor over.,"30 female. No medical conditions. Take cymbalta for anxiety. I've lost a lot of weight, so I don't have my current weight. 

I feel kind of stupid worrying about this, but it hurts a ton. Two days ago I noticed my tongue was very sore. Looked at it later it the mirror and there were a couple pus-filled things right where I felt the pain of a lump inside my tongue. There are a few hard lumps in my tongue and then today when I looked because it hurt so much I can see it's kind of swollen in those spots. There's cracks (I guess that's the best description) that have pus in them and then a lot of white bumps on top that hurt. The problem is, I don't know if those cracks are always there, and if the white bumps are just inflamed tastebuds. My tongue is covered in a lot of white right now. Eating certain foods stings too much. My mouth tastes bad sometimes with it. Right now, it is sore and feels sort of burned, like of I drank coffee that was way too hot. My throat hurt a lot of the day today, but it's fine now. 

I am worried it's an infection, but I also feel silly getting worked up over what could be nothing. I don't know if this is worth going to the doctor.

I also wanted to ask if it's possible it could be an STI in my mouth? My husband left me, and we sometimes hook up. He said he hasn't been with anyone, but I think that's bullshit and I'm worried that it's an STI. But my anxiety makes it hard for me to know what worries are valid, especially since I am not a doctor. ",1,1746414351.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1kf1hup,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1kf1hup/six_months_great_sex_real_feelings_until_she/,"Six Months, Great Sex, Real Feelings‚Ä¶ Until She Asked for One Last Advance","About 7 months ago, I met Sofia on SA. I was just coming out of a situationship and had a few prior experiences with sugar arrangements while traveling. I was 32, she was 27, and we met in a major metropolitan city. Over drinks at a bar, we hit it off‚Äîgreat conversation, natural chemistry. Not long after, she proposed a PPM arrangement, and we began what would become a steady sugar relationship.

From the start, the physical chemistry was undeniable. We‚Äôd go 2‚Äì4 rounds a night depending on the mood, and both of our needs were more than met. To be honest, the PPM she requested felt modest given the dynamic. We met about once a week, kept things simple‚Äîno drama, no alcohol, just great sex. Occasionally, she‚Äôd ask for an advance: once when she traveled abroad, once when I had to cancel. I always obliged.

Our time together was fun and easy. She'd come over, we'd hook up, laugh, and unwind. Over time, I learned bits about her culture. I especially appreciated when she introduced me to a foreign film from her country‚Äîit was a small gesture, but it stuck with me.

Things began to shift slightly. Before the holidays, she slept over for the first time as a kind of ‚Äúspecial occasion.‚Äù In January, we went to a concert together‚Äîshe even met some of my friends. She surprised me by showing up to cheer at the finish line when I ran a half marathon. Then came Valentine‚Äôs Day. We spent it together, and she casually mentioned she didn‚Äôt see us ending up together. I told her I hadn‚Äôt ruled anything out, and that maybe we could explore a real relationship. Through some miscommunication, she thought we¬†*were*¬†now boyfriend and girlfriend, and added me on social media for the first time. At the end of the night, I clarified the misunderstanding‚Äîshe stormed out and unfriended me.

I texted her, apologized, and said we were still just getting to know each other. Surprisingly, that didn‚Äôt end things. Our arrangement continued, but with more variety‚Äîwe started doing non-sexual things like beach days, park strolls, even a dance social. She helped me pack the day before a big trip to Argentina. If we didn‚Äôt hook up, she never asked for anything. We binged¬†*White Lotus*¬†together, and during that time, she brought a surprising sense of calm into my life.

While I was in Argentina (about six weeks ago), I realized I had real feelings for her‚Äîthis wasn‚Äôt just a casual hookup anymore. When I got back, she was dealing with a visa issue in Mexico. Before she left, we watched the¬†*White Lotus*finale together and talked seriously. I told her what I had been thinking during my trip‚Äîthat I wanted to explore something real with her. She said she‚Äôd want to spend more time together too, but still needed financial support. I asked if getting a two-bedroom condo and having her move in would be enough support. She said yes.

The night before she left, she invited me to her place to say goodbye. For the first time, we hooked up at¬†*her*¬†apartment‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt pay her. It felt... different. We made plans for me to visit her in Mexico, and a few weeks later, I did. We explored Monterrey together. I paid for the hotel and meals, but she covered her own travel from Mexico City. We had a lot of sex but didn‚Äôt talk about the relationship dynamic. It was fun, but a bit unspoken.

Ten days after she returned to my country, she texted me saying she was back and excited to see me. Then came the request‚Äîshe had overspent and needed an advance. I said I was excited to see her too, but wanted things to feel real, not transactional. She agreed in principle, said she wanted that too and hoped we could talk... but circled back to the money.

That‚Äôs when I realized I had to step back. I told her I was looking for something genuine. She wished me the best and deleted my contact. A few days later, I reached out to see if she wanted to meet for coffee. She politely declined. I assume she already lined up someone new.

Looking back, I genuinely enjoyed my time with her. I miss her. It‚Äôs jarring how quickly the mask came off, though. Part of me wishes we had just kept it simple‚Äîhookup buddies with no confusion. But maybe that would have just delayed the inevitable while I stayed stuck, still without a real girlfriend.

1kf1hgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/cuck_femdom_tales/comments/1kf1hgf/cuckold_to_be_part_2_femdom_humiliation_chastity/,"Cuckold to be. Part 2. [Femdom, humiliation, chastity, feminization]","This story is a continuation if a story I previously published.  This story will contain, hotwife, cuckold, ballbusting, female domination and some forced feminization.

I awoke with a bit of a start, but definitely groggy.  I open my eyes and see my Mistress/wife standing there radiant and sexy as hell.  She looks flush like she had just had a vigorous work out (nothing new for her) and is absolutely glowing and wearing a very pleased with herself smile on her face.  She is also wearing workout clothes that she had worn in a very sexy photo shoot she did at a friend's gym after hours.  She has on some very cheeky bottoms, that do more to reveal and frame her perfectly round and firm ass than to cover or contain it. The bright red shorts look great with her long red hair that is braided in pigtails and the white sports bra, that is doing very little other than covering her nipples and framing and pushing up her ample cleavage to form the most perfect atheletic cleavage known to man.  As I looked closely her eye makeup was in tact and she might have had lipstick on recently, but it is definitely smeared off now.  

She is standing next to a tall blonde woman of obvious German or eastern European decent.  This woman is dressed in the uniform of the hotel and stands easily 6'2"" and is just thick in all of her proportions.    She is not attractive nor unattractice in the face.  She looks like she is in her 30s.  

Kate, my wife, introduces Helga as the lead masseuse for the hotel.  She said that she thanked me for reserving a massage for her this morning, but after talking over coffee what my wife had planned, Helga proposed that I recieve a day full of her and her mate's in the spa attention.  

I recognize during her talk that i am naked.  Naked and tied down to the bed.  Spread eagle.  I feel my caged cock try to rouse, but its cage limits its movement.

My wife, seeing my eyes roam to assess my predicament, reaches for the sheet that is covering me and pulls it back exposing me to Helga.  

She continues, ""So dear, you are going to be the lucky recipient of Helga and her teams full service.  You will get a deep tissue massage, and I have asked her to focus on your genitals as they will be sore from last night.  You will also be given a high colonic, and even a full body wax.  You are hers today.  Completely.  She will be your key holder today.""  Kate removes the key around her neck and puts it around Helgas neck. ""You will do whatever she says.  And to reinforce your submission to me and her you will remain naked, caged, and plugged.""

""What will I be doing?  Well after meeting a few of the guys we saw yesterday at the pool for a morning workout in the fitness center for a vigorous workout, I was invited back to Daniels room for a protein shake.  He said he makes the best around, and he was not lying.   I am off to see a bit of the city with Jake and Chad and will hopefully grab some lunch before we all meet down at the pool.  Apparently the Saturday pool scene is pretty wild and adventurous.  We can meet then if you are up for it."" 

She turned to Helga ""I want you you to feel comfortable with a couple of key things:  1) He is a great pussy licker and you should feel free to use his face as often as you like and so should your crew in the spa."" My wife pulls down her bottoms and straddles my face and lowers herself to reinforce the sense of feeling comfortable.  ""Second, my cucky is a little pain and humiliation slut.  So there is more cash for humiliating him, but his balls should not go with out your best and most aggressive techniques.  Do your best and worst and dont let him fool you.  I have kicked him full force many times and stood on his little nuts and they are tough as nails.  He is not but they are.  Third, be flexible as you know plans evolve.  I do want to say thank you for this."" 

With that she begins to rock back and forth grinding her very wet pussy across my face and over my mouth.  I am licking and sucking for all I am worth and fairly suspicious that I am tasting Daniel's protein shake and that it is 'cream pie' flavored.  Kate reaches down and squeezes my balls and helps Helga establish her grip.  Soon Helga is wrenching my poor bruised balls while I lick and groan into my wifes (possibly well fucked pussy).  Kate cums and my face recieves a sizeable deposit of juice and cream on it.  Kate stands up and invites Helga to take her seat and thanks her for making me scream into her wet cunt as it made her cum so hard.  (My bollocks were not thanking her as her grip was that of a machinist, and I was sure that my left nut had been destroyed, only to have her adjust her grip and squeeze it differently and to find out there are higher levels of pain.) 

Helga wiggles out of the bottom half of her uniform, leggings and a pair of full bottom panties.  I see a trimmed snatch and darkness as she moves to straddle my head and reaffirm her grip on my tender balls.  She squeezes and mounts my face, she is much thicker than my wife and breathing will become an issue.  I hear Kate close the door to the bathroom as she goes to take a shower and am lost for the next 30 minutes as I lap at Helgas oversized clit and lips as she grips and mangles my tinder and now swollen balls.  

I am finally allowed to breathe as Helga collapses next to my prone and panting body.  I see Kate blow through, showered, fixed and ready for her lunch dates.  She is wearing a tiny tennis skirt that bounces around her round bottom, a half shirt tank top that shows her ample cleavage and her erect nipples as she is not wearing a bra.  She always wears matching bra and panties.  She comes over to me, kisses my forehead, and then spins around showing me under her skirt. Her panties match her bra and like the old joke says, the drapes are natural ginger, but the floor is brazilian.  

She bring something tiny down to my face.  She asks me if I know what this is.  As my eyes focus, I see it is the pink plastic 'nub' chastity cage.  A year ago on this trip when this day seemed impossibly far away, I remarked that ""she could put me in this tiny cage (its less than an inch long and makes my dick disappear) when she decides to cuckold me and I will wear it, in public to the hotel pool, and not take it off until I am allowed access to her pussy again.""  She recites to me those exact words and says her pussy is off limits to my now inadequate cock, and my inadequate cock is now banished to the nub.  She tosses it to Helga and asks her to put it on me when she waxes me down there.  

She picks up her bag and sunglasses and heads out in her high heeled sneakers that really make her ass look good and will make everyman wonder if she is wearing panties.  She heads out the door to be seen by men, to be near men and most likely to experience younger men.

I am left naked, caged, tied to a bed and awaiting the days activities.  

Helga rouses and says 'Lets go down zee stairs to the spa and specifically to my table.  I think you will like what I have planned for you.'  She puts back on her pants and then unties me and lets me use the restroom and wash my face ( it was covered in pussy juice, and maybe Daniel's 'protein shake.')

I come out in my bathrobe and she tells me ""no"".  She removes my bathrobe but does allow me to carry a wash cloth in my hands that are crossed in front of my waist and covering parts of my caged cock and balls.  I am led to the service elevator at the far end of the hall.  We pass a couple and a pair of 20 somethjng girls already drunk and on their way to the pool.  I soon find myself nude, caged and squished against the wall by a laundry cart as a pair of cleaning ladies as Helga about why my cock is so small and caged and why I am naked.  I am led through the service entrance of the spa, past a pair of workers on their break who stop to gawk at my nudity and soon in Helgas massage room.  

She has me crawl onto her table and for the next 90 minutes she pummels all of my major muscle groups leaving me relaxed and sore.  My balls also get similar treatment as the tense muscles in my shoulders, heavy kneading and lots of strong gripping and rubbing.  Needless to say I could have said 'fuck' from the pain for the entire 90 minutes.  

Soon i am on my feet and off to the next station.  My high colonic.  I am put on a table face down and am give a series of enemas to 'cleanse me'.  

Next I am off to be waxed.  Like everywhere.  ""Especially there"", I am told.  I spend the next 2 hours screaming and imbibing liquor to relax.  Soon I am pronounced baby smooth. Balls, cock, ass, arms, arm pits and legs and back and yes everywhere is smooth.  

During my massage, Helga removed my ""normal"" cock cage.  One that Kate and I had been experiementing with.  And now she is back. I am still in what could be an Ob/Gyn's office with the stirrups.  And my arms are bound behind my back.  Helga comes in with a bowl of ice water.  She dips my cock and balls in it and both shrink up within minutes.  Next she takes some silocone lubricant and slathers up my cock and balls.  Then she threads my shriveled cold penis into the tiny opening, and my balls through the smallest of the available rings.  Soon my shriveled manhood is enshrined in pink sissy plastic and locked away.  

This feeling and its implication gets to me.  Like kind of swirling in the twin feelings of being in a smaller and long term chastity and the sense that complete strangers are getting access to what had been my pussy.  My exclusive use pussy. My hot wife's pussy.  Or more concisely, my hotwife's pussy.  Its not mine anymore.  I may get to lick it.  I may get to see it.  But fucking it, feeling its tight velvety embrace.  That is for younger and more fit men.  Not chaste, cucks who like their balls busted and have sissy tendencies.

In all of my head swirl, i did not notice that I had been moved to the nail salon.  Here i am in what could easily be a room of 10 women, and I am naked, except for my cage, getting my finger nails and toe nails painted... pink to match my cage.  Awesome.  I begin to recoil just as Helga walks up behind me and puts my wife on the phone up to my ear.  ""I just had the best time at lunch, Jake and Chad were surpisingly suoer fun to hang out with.  I have never felt so full. Sure they are quintessential fuckboys but anyway.  They loved hearing about you and may find you later for some additional training.  Anyway, i am changing and about to head to the pool.  Ill text you a pic once I settle on an outfit.  I think my binkinis may be too boring, and I dont want to be boring anymore. Enjoy your time at the spa, ill send you a pic with what I decide.""

She talks to Helga a few minutes more. I do not notice but a few women, dressed in comfy robes come in.  They do not recoil in horror at my nudity but rather seem intrigued and Helga stops by to explain.  Soon I am asked to model my micro chastity cage.  One of the women remarks that this is perfect revenge for having to wear a micro bikini.  ""Good for your wife.""

I am then escorted to another room.  Its ver relaxing with calming music and dim lightting. My arms are bound to the arms of the chair and my ankles to the the feet of the plush chair.  I am given cucumber slices to cover my eye lids held in place by a mask. I can feel more people enter the small space and i hear the mistakeable sound of one maybe two men stroking.  A firm strong hand grabs my visible balls and begins to squeeze.  The other pushes my head back so that i would be looking straight up at the ceiling.  I hear the stroking pick up pace and two different voices grunt.  My mask is ripped off in time to see a black dick and a white dick being stroked over my face. I manage to close my eyes just in time for the anglo first then the afro dick explode and shoot ribbons of hot cum all over my face.  I am held there by Helga's strong grip on my chin and my balls.  She has has gripped and stretched my balls and held them close together and then planted her strong knee right on top of them as she places her body weight on my testicles.   The men above me continue to drain their cocks onto my face.  Eventually, my nose is covered and i have to open my mouth to breathe.  One of the cocks begins to trace along my lips.  I absent-mindedly trace my tongue along the head and and open up my mouth first to breathe and then to accommodate the thick cock, tasting the end of his orgasm.  I suck the tip and take the entire tip into my mouth.  

Here I am, bound to a comfortable chair, head pushed back by my wife's gargantuan assisstant who has also planted her knee and her considerable heft right on my balls.  Two dudes have just glazed my face with loads of cum and now I am sucking a dick.  I feel the weight shift Helga's grip on me is released as I continue to suckle the cock that should be softening in my mouth.  I feel the cock move from the side of my face and his feet move to stand on the arms of the chair.  He grabs the sides of my head and he eases his still hard cock into my mouth and he begins to fuck my mouth then my throat. His cock gaining access in part due to the amount of training I have been given and due to the amount of cum I have already sucked out of his cock. He stands over me and really starts fucking my throat pinning my head down and bouncing his balls off my chin.  I concentrate on swallowing his cock and finding ways to breathe.  I open my eyes enough to realize it was the black cock and also to realize that Helga is filming my debasement.  I hear her talk into the camera, ""After a relaxing day at the spa, with a massage, colonic and mani - pedi, I arranged for your husband to recieve a facial.  Now it looks like he is being given a deep tissue massage and throat stretching from our in house trainer, Daniel.""

""Is the taste familiar to you, little cocksucker?"" Daniel said grinning down at me, his defined arms, chiseled chest and perfect teeth mocking my soft submissive self.  He picks up the pace and his cock hardens and really begins to stretch my jaw and work the back of my throat.  ""Your wife was right, you are a natural cock sucker.  She is a beautiful woman, with a tight body and a very tight pussy.  You should have heard her moan when I split her open with my cock. But of course she is tight, if the only thing she had inside her was your pathetic dicklet."" He throws his muscular thigh over my shoulder, further asserting his dominance.  Looking down in my cum covered face, ""You are not enough of a man for her, you are hardly a man at all.  With that he grabs my chin, tilts my head back and proceeds to crawl up on my face, dipping his shaved black balls in my mouth.  I suck dutifully, he takes the phone from Helga and films me up close and personal, sucking his scrotum, probably still coated in my wifes juices, contentedly.  He continues to berate me, ""Your wife has finally seen the light, she has deciced to live a life for her.  Your life will be very different, and as submissive as you are... ""  He positions himself so that his asshole is right over my mouth, spreads his firm cheeks and lowers his puckered hole down to my mouth.  His huge balls are covering my nose and his hard slimy cock lays on my forehead.  He commands me to "" lick his ass then to 'tongue-fuck it."" I respond in a trance and do exactly as he says burying my tongue in his ass hole and moving it in and out. He strokes his cock above me.  I hear laughter from Helga and my wife who is watching my humiliation via facetime.  Eventually i am allowed to breathe.  I feel my arms and legs being released.  I am told to stand and put my face close to the seat of the chair, spread my legs and keep my legs straight.  Helga places the phone on facetime on the seat.  My wife/mistress gets her first look at me.  My face is covered in jizz. My mouth now tastes like Daniels ass hole and further my humiliation ... unnnnnggggg.... Daniel is penetrating my ass with his thick cock.   And my wife gets to watch my facial expressions real time.  Daniel takes his time, enjoying my humiliation.  Once fully inside me, he makes me ask for permission to be fucked by his Dick from my Mistress and then beg for his big black Master cock.  He makes sure that I recognize his cock as my Master.  Soon I am panting like a bitch in heat as my Master fucks me so good.  He has control of my hips slamming his meat into my hungry ass then as he gets close to cumming, he has me lean back and maintain my grip on the chair.  He grabs my hair and wrenches my face around to his and has me beg for his cum from Master cock.  I beg as Helga films the whole thing part amused, part aroused and part finding my submission and humiliation hilarious.  He pulls my head straight back and puts his his fingers in my mouth, 'fish hooking' me, as he continues to fuck me deep and hard.  My back is arched and I am staring at the ceiling, totally submitted to and enraptured by the power of this Alpha that earlier had fucked my wife.  I feel Master flex deep in my ass hole and his balls have stopped slapping against my taint as Master pulses then shoots rope after rope of hot cum deep in my guts.  My clitty would be hard in its micro cage, if it could get hard.  But instead I am left leaking.  His hands move out of my mouth as he just wraps one around my neck and chokes me as he drains his cock in my ass.  His other hand finds my balls and squeezes them and pulls them down as he commands me to my knees.  Soon his cock is back in my mouth as I suck him dry and clean his cock from my ass, which was very clean due to the set of enemas I had taken earlier.  He tells me to keep the last bit in my mouth as he pulls out grabs his shorts and walks out of the room, his big semi hard dick swinging to his thighs as he walked.  I am left a sweaty cum covered and well fucked wreck.  

I look around as I regain my senses.  Helga is approaching with a bundle of something in her hands.... 

To be continued.

I‚Äôm a coffee-loving creative on the east coast of Florida who values depth, humor, and emotional honesty. Faith is a daily part of my life, not just Sundays, but something that grounds me and helps shape how I treat people and myself. I grew up Seventh-day Adventist, walked through a season in Messianic faith, and now find myself aligned with non-denominational Christianity, walking closely with God and seeking someone who gets that.

I‚Äôm in a season of growth‚Äîspiritually, emotionally, and creatively. I share my home with people I love and a few lovable pets. I have two small tattoos (if that‚Äôs a dealbreaker, I understand), and I‚Äôm always seeking to become more grounded, healed, and whole. Growth, in every sense, is part of my rhythm. I care deeply about emotional depth, discernment, and gentleness paired with strength. Accountability and self-awareness matter to me, as does a steady pursuit of peace, purpose, and alignment with God.

Family is incredibly important to me, and while I live in a close-knit home now, I hope to start my own someday. I‚Äôve been through enough to know what I don‚Äôt want, but I haven‚Äôt let that make me hard. 

Vulnerable? Yes. 
Bitter? No. 
Healing and hopeful? Absolutelyüíï

Then one day I started seeing her every time I went, but it never went further than her handing me the drink and me saying thank you

Then one day she complimented me but I didn‚Äôt think anything of it, I‚Äôm a regular at this point.

Then I started getting notes on my cups and she would always pop her head out to say hello to me even tho she never worked at the window anymore

Still never thought anything of, but then after a lot of coffees with Hearts on the cup and stuff like ""heyyy king"" with hearts and stuff.

So one day I just decided to ask the window girl to tell her to come, I asked for her number and got it. We texted for 3 days and then she ghosted me.

PLEASE do not think I am mad, I just took it as me misreading the customer/barista relationship and I let it go. Tbh I stopped going to Starbucks for a week lol but I started going back again. She didn‚Äôt work the first couple times and now I‚Äôve gone twice and seen her twice. Both time my cup just says ""heyyy"" and the time today said ""heyyyy‚Ä¶"",

**What Is ‚ÄúMetabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh‚Äù?**

Let‚Äôs kick things off with the ‚Äúwhat.‚Äù *Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* is a deep-dive, science-backed, no-fluff course for anyone wanting to truly understand how the body works at a biochemical level. It‚Äôs not your average wellness fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs the real academic deal made digestible. Dr. Walsh, known for blending clinical depth with real-world practicality, guides you through 15 massive modules filled with everything from the basics of cellular biology to complex pathways like methylation, inflammation, and metabolic integration. You don‚Äôt just learn *what* happens‚Äîyou learn *why* it matters.

**Who Is It For? (Spoiler: It‚Äôs Not Just for Nerds)**

This course is ideal for functional medicine practitioners, health coaches, nutritionists, and advanced biohackers who are tired of surface-level advice and want to connect the dots at the cellular level. But here‚Äôs the cool part: if you‚Äôre just a super-curious health enthusiast with a passion for learning, *Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* gives you the tools to decode the body‚Äôs processes like a pro. Just be ready‚Äîit‚Äôs intense, but in the best way.

**Where Does All the Learning Happen?**

Anywhere, my friend. This entire program is delivered online, so you can take it at your own pace, on your own terms, whether you're on a tablet in a cozy coffee shop or pulling a late-night study session on your laptop. No need for a lecture hall‚Äî*Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* meets you where you're at.

**When Should You Dive In?**

Honestly? Yesterday. But now works too. Since it's self-paced, you can start whenever you're ready and move at a rhythm that fits your life. Whether you want to binge it like a Netflix series or pace it week-by-week, the structure is there to support your learning style.

**Why This Course Stands Out (aka the Gold Underneath the Hood)**

Most nutrition or fitness courses barely scratch the surface‚Äîthey tell you *what* to do, but never *why* it works. This course flips the script. Dr. Bryan Walsh doesn‚Äôt just teach‚Äîyou‚Äôre going to *understand* how metabolism works, how energy is made, how nutrients are transformed, and what happens when things go wrong. From glycolysis and lipolysis to mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, this course is like opening the hood of a Ferrari and learning how every part fits together. It empowers you to think critically about health, instead of just memorizing facts.

**How Does It All Work? (Brace Yourself for the Curriculum)**

You‚Äôre looking at 15 detailed modules packed with video lectures (think: over 60 units!). It all begins with Functional Cellular Biology, then ramps into macronutrients‚Äîcarbs, proteins, and fats. As you progress, you‚Äôll get into the juicy stuff: biochemical pathways like glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, beta-oxidation, gluconeogenesis, and more. The final modules tie it all together with practical clinical application, metabolic integration, and systems-level understanding of inflammation, the nervous system, and mitochondria.

**Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?**

Absolutely. If you want to be *dangerously smart* when it comes to nutritional biochemistry, *Metabolic Fitness Pro Lv. 1 - Nutritional Biochemistry - Dr. Bryan Walsh* delivers. This isn‚Äôt some glossed-over course with fancy graphics and empty promises‚Äîit‚Äôs the kind of education that changes how you see the body and empowers you to make smarter decisions, whether in clinic or daily life.",1,1746413288.0,OberonLearning,1,1.0,False

1kf18r8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1kf18r8/the_friends_i_made_at_the_beginning_of_university/,The friends I made at the beginning of university made it hard for me to make new friends,"Long story, but I appreciate it if you read the whole way through. I am now 23 (F), but this happened several years ago and I'm still so bitter about it.

Before I started university I was in an abusive relationship that had left me graduating high school with no close friends and I was just coming to terms with my anxiety disorder. I started university during the pandemic, so that meant regularly I only spent time with my family and ex, but I really wanted to make friends so I joined several student groupchats and discords. I met my friend Alia at that time and we hit it off. We were texting all the time, facetiming, sharing book recommendations, and planning things to do together when she finally moved to the town where our university is located. One big thing we talked about is how hard isolation was and how when we were back in person we would form the best friend group ever and make friends with lots of new people. This year took a particular turn for the worse because I broke up with my ex after I found out they cheated and an important family member died.

A year later we finally meet in person at a party and I was so excited to meet her, but when I got there she was so drunk. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to chatting with her and supporting each other at our first big uni party, but she kind of abandoned me. I let it slide because I knew she had bad anxiety and was drinking to cope, so I kept an eye on her but decided to talk to new people. I then met Samantha and we hit it off too. She was cool, funny, and it felt like we had a lot in common. Soon the three of us were thick as thieves. We regularly had sleepovers, texted daily, travelled to each others hometowns, spent our birthdays together, and went to a concert together. Third year rolls around and everything is back to the way it was pre-covid. I confide in my friends telling them that I'm feeling anxious because I really want to make new friends, but I've always found talking to new people tricky (particularly due to my social anxiety). On the first day of school I meet up with Alia and she's hanging out with a new friend, and I immediately feel like the third wheel. At a later date when Alia and I are hanging out just the two of us I mention the fact that I'd love to become friends with her new friends too because they seem really cool and I'd love to be invited to things as a group. She gets defensive and essentially says ""Well it really isn't up to me but sure I'll keep that in mind"". Then Thanksgiving rolls around and this is when shit starts to happen. I new that Alia was having a friendsgiving with some of her other friends who were also from out of town, and I was happy for her while I celebrated the holiday with my family (my hometown is also where my university is). However, the next time the three of us have class together I find out through another person that Samantha also was at the friendsgiving. That would totally normal if it wasn't for the fact that Samantha is from the same town as me/our university and she was with her family earlier that day. I reach out to Alia later that day to express my frustration that it hurt my feelings how Samantha was invited and I wasn't which made me feel excluded, and Alia just kept making excuses. The argument ended in Alia telling me we should just be ""casual friends"". I was heartbroken. Alia was the friend I was closest with and she had been there for me when I had gone through all those hard things in first year, so she felt like the person I trusted most in my life. A few weeks later Samantha posted on social media about hanging out with Alia, and this is after I had isolated myself from people for a while (leaving as soon as class was done, not making the first move to text/hangout, and generally being quiet in class) and Samantha had not said anything about it. I asked Samantha if she was mad at me, to which she replied that we hadn't talked in a while and that her and Alia hanging out was ""perfectly normal"". I just isolated further because I truly felt so judged for wanting time and care from my friends. Alia never said anything else and Samantha never tried to reach out to find out what was going on with me or get my perspective.

Another year later I'm in a loving relationship with the most patient, understanding, caring person I have ever met and I begin to open up about how I was abused and how my previous friends really made it hard to trust. My partner got me feeling so good about myself again and I began reaching out more to new people, going to more events, and generally putting myself out there. The one part that I really struggled with was having all my classes with my ex-friends. It was so uncomfortable. So I reached out to Alia asking if we could meet sometime to talk to hopefully make things less uncomfortable. She agreed and we scheduled a time. 10 minutes before the meetup she said nevermind and that she hopes I have a good time with the rest of my studies. I felt so stupid and resentful, but I still felt like I had no closure with Samantha. So I texted Samantha asking how she was and how come she never reached out when I started getting distant. She replied with the longest, cruellest, least willing to take responsibility message I have ever read. She told me my mental health was too much, that we had nothing in common, that I was too needy, and then she ended it with ""do not try to reach out to me again"". I felt so blind-sided and angry because Samantha had mental health struggles too. In fact, she was at the beginning of understanding some new diagnoses and I was trying my best to be there for her, but she was incredibly private. I admit that isolating myself wasn't necessarily the most mature way to handle everything, but her response essentially shamed me for my openness about my social anxiety and made me feel like a burden she was glad to be rid of.

I tried so many times now to make new friends in my program, but it seems every time they just become best friends with Alia and Samantha. I became friends with Chloe and I told her that being around Alia and Samantha made me uncomfortable, but I was always happy hanging out with her when they weren't around. Chloe began getting closer and closer to Alia and Samantha and more and more distant from me, but I wanted to keep our friendship going. I invited Chloe to my birthday party and she told me ""I don't think it's a good idea if I come, but happy birthday!"" She never brought up why she didn't think it was a good idea with me and whenever we had class together she acted like everything was just fine. I then became friends with Marsha and from the get-go I told her I really wanted to make new friends in my program because I'd had such a bad falling out with my past friends. She was kind and told me she'd be wary and keep that in mind, but I did know she was friends with Chloe so she would interact with Alia and Samantha often enough. In my last semester of university Marsha began posting about hanging out frequently with Alia and Chloe, and I reached out to have a talk with her over coffee. She left me on read. We ran into each other about a month later and she was like ""I saw your message and I promise I'll reply soon!"" It's nearly a year later and it's still crickets. Another friend I made was through my student job and she was also in the same university program as me, but now she regularly posts about group hangouts with Alia, Marsha, and Chloe.

If you made it this far thank you for reading, I really appreciate it. I'm hoping by posting this into the void of the internet that maybe it'll give me some solace. I have many new friends now who are so caring and understanding, I just find sometimes I'm still so resentful and they left me with serious trust issues that have been an obstacle at times for getting closer to others.

Prunilda Plum never lacked self-confidence. An overachiever, there was much she couldn't do if she applied her mind. But that same mind compelled her to snack without restraint on everything sweet and savory. She had a notorious weakness for Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups and could devour an entire tub by herself. Being fat in America is the norm and she was proud of her full figure. But beneath her confident exterior, her plush blanket of flesh told a different story.   
  
Her skin was a topographic map of turbulence, with stretch marks that resembled the aftermath of a lightning storm on steroids. They felt like tender, sensitive terrain, and the slightest touch sparked a storm of synaptic transmissions. Jagged, ivory-white streaks zigzagged across her skin, once stretched taut by her weight, now loose and flabby like bolts of lightning that had short-circuited and decided to take up permanent residence. The pearlescent lines streaked across her skin like the lingering imprint of lightning bolts, seared into her flesh as indelibly as the flash of a bolt still burns in your eyes long after you've looked away.   
  
These flesh expansion striations were a constant reminder of her struggles with weight, and she often found herself covering them up with clothing layered like lasagna. Her body had become a real-time lightning map. Each mark pulsed with the promise of another impending thundergust, as if her skin was daring the universe to unleash another tempest. The sheer drama of these lightning strikes made it seem as though her skin was aggregating cosmic weather reports from all ages, with stretch marks serving as the electrifying evidence.   
  
Determined to rewrite her body's weather forecast, Prunilda dialed Dr. Dryman's hotline to schedule a Brain Dehydra procedure, a revolutionary new technique that desiccated her brain to the consistency of a prune, eliminating entire snack aisles from her consciousness. She was willing to risk turning her brain into a mustard seed if it meant no more late-night runs to Trader Joe's for oatmeal cookies with white chocolate.   
  
Two weeks later, after a crowded subway ride reeking of stale onion sweat and unwashed ass ‚Äì a savvy decision to avoid the $9 Congestion Relief Zone toll ‚Äì Prunilda walked into Dr. Dryman's bustling clinic, situated in the busy heart of Midtown Manhattan, where the unconventional Brain Dehydra procedure awaited.   
  
Dr. Dryman carefully inserted a nasopharyngeal catheter into Prunilda's nasal cavity, guiding it through the nasal passages and into the sphenoid sinus. The procedure was surprisingly comfortable, and Prunilda found herself wondering if the good doctor moonlighted as a nose whisperer, reconstructing broken noses for the world's most unfortunate mixed martial artists. With the catheter in place, Dr. Dryman connected a high-flow nasal cannula to a heated air generator, which would blow warm air directly into Prunilda's brain, initiating the dehydration process.   
  
The hot air, precisely controlled by a thermistor-regulated heating element, would gradually dry out the brain tissue, reducing its volume and, thereby, eliminating the neural pathways responsible for Prunilda's snack cravings. It was a bit like using a blowtorch to dehydrate tropical fruits. As the procedure progressed, Dr. Dryman monitored Prunilda's vital signs and brain activity using an electroencephalogram (EEG) and adjusted the airflow and temperature as needed to ensure a safe and effective brain-drying treatment. The EEG looked like a seismograph during an earthquake, but Dr. Dryman assured her it was all perfectly within beta parameters.

A week later, Brain Dehydra procedure's side effects began to manifest, Prunilda's thoughts took an unexpected plunge ‚Äì into the depths of an all-consuming obsession with water. As the dehydrated neural pathways in Prunilda's brain reached a critical state of desiccation, it was as if her cerebral cortex had initiated a desperate salvage operation, forcibly rerouting all extraneous thoughts through a singular, water-logged lens. Every thought was like a drop of water tracing an erratic path down a rain-slicked glass surface. Every fleeting notion, every stray idea, was hijacked and transformed into a water-themed variant, as if her brain's electrical impulses were frantically seeking solace in the fluidity of H2O.   
  
As the hydra fixation reached its zenith, Prunilda's living room transformed into a veritable aquatic shrine. Water-patterned wallpaper seemed to ripple on the walls as she lounged on her plush couch, surrounded by a mesmerizing array of indoor fountains, their gentle gurgles harmonizing with the soothing sounds of ocean waves emanating from her Bluetooth speaker. The aroma of saltwater and seaweed rising like incense, tendrils of smoke reaching for the sky, as if she had lit a thousand sticks to honor the hydration gods.   
  
The soft hum of aquarium filters and the gentle lapping of water from the miniature pool in the corner created a calming ambiance, further amplified by the fine mist dispersing from the water fountain cap perched atop her head Prunilda felt like an obese mermaid, her senses lulled into a state of tranquility by the watery symphony. Her specially designed 'Hydra Hydration Suit' circulated water through visible tubes, creating an otherworldly aura as she basked in the aquatic ambiance. The suit's transparent tubes pulsed with a soft blue glow, like a network of glowing jellyfish suspended beneath her skin.   
  
On the coffee table, a collection of hydra figurines seemed to nod in approval as she sang along to Tyla's 'Water' on repeat, her voice barely audible over the cacophony of water sounds. Prunilda's singing was woefully off-key, but the water fountains seemed to appreciate her enthusiasm. As Kevin Costner battled the villainous Deacon in the Waterworld movie playing on her TV, Prunilda's obsession reached a fever pitch, setting the stage for the tragic denouement that would soon follow. The movie's aquatic action scenes seemed to mirror Prunilda's own descent into hydra madness, and she felt an unsettling sense of kinship with the film's water-obsessed characters. In the grips of hydra fixation's insidious side effect, Prunilda's parched psyche was consumed by an unquenchable thirst. Her mouth was a Sahara dryland, and her tongue felt like a strip of camel jerky left to desiccate in the calcining sun.   
  
She stumbled back to her apartment, fixated on the office-style water cooler in the corner, its 5-gallon jug precariously perched on top. With a fervor bordering on delirium, Prunilda triggered the dispenser, unleashing a deluge of water that she gulped down with reckless abandon, draining the entire jug in a matter of minutes. The water gushed out like the Ocoee Rapids, its cool liquid rush a momentary balm to Prunilda's moistureless soul. The ensuing waterlogged catastrophe sent her electrolyte balance into a catastrophic nosedive, precipitating a fatal arrhythmia, her heart thrashing like a fish out of water, its final, futile beats a desperate bid for life.  
  
As the ER docs would later report, Prunilda's hyponatremic havoc culminated in a textbook case of water intoxication-induced cardiac arrest ‚Äì a tragically absurd finale to her quest for snack liberation. In the end, Prunilda's pursuit of moderation had been replaced by a lethal excess. The desiccated remnants of her brain having paradoxically spawned a thirst for destruction, testament that sometimes the cure for a craving is fatally flawed.",1,1746412876.0,Unstyle,0,1.0,False

1kf13ka,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1kf13ka/chips_chapter_1/,Chips - Chapter 1,"The snow floated, lazy and soft, blanketing Whitley Gap in a hush that even the plow trucks seemed reluctant to break. After a day and night of freezing rain, followed by a thick snowfall, the Kentucky roads were treacherous and devoid of traffic. Most people had the good sense to stay home. Liam Birch never paid much attention to good sense.

He gripped the steering wheel with one gloved hand, the other cradling a coffee thermos wedged into his cup holder. His truck roared beneath him, tires crunching over the hard-packed ice that lined the back roads into town.

Animal Control had called earlier that morning‚Äîshort-staffed, over-capacity, and desperate. A dog needed out. Today. Snowstorm or not. Liam didn‚Äôt ask questions. He just pulled on his boots and grabbed a leash.

 The roads leading to the county shelter wound through overgrown pasture and hollowed-out barns, the kind of scenery that made people nostalgic for a Kentucky only their grandparents remembered. He passed Earl‚Äôs co-op, the old mill that no one had touched since the flood of ‚Äô97, and finally the squat concrete building that housed the county‚Äôs unwanted.

He parked, the engine idling for a moment before he cut it. The silence that followed was nearly complete‚Äîexcept for the distant, muted barking that cut through the cold, a reminder that there was work to be done.

Liam pulled his hood down and stepped through the double doors into the front lobby. Inside lay the familiar smell of bleach and wet dog. Industrial fans whirred, creating a constant rumble that accompanied the busy clutter of barking and metallic clanging. A phone rang in a nearby room, Liam knew it would likely go unanswered.

‚ÄúBirch!‚Äù called a voice from the back. ‚ÄúWe were about to call out the search and rescue dogs to go find you. People are running off the roads left and right out there. I‚Äôm surprised we have anyone here at all. How was your drive in?‚Äù A familiar face peered through the service window, Isaac, one of the Animal Control officers, smiled through to Liam.

‚ÄúNot bad, but I know how to drive in weather like this, and having the truck helps.‚Äù

The officer nodded. ‚ÄúWell, we appreciate you coming out to pick her up. I think you‚Äôll like her. She‚Äôs just your type.‚Äù

Liam‚Äôs brow rose. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if I should be nervous or excited to hear that. What‚Äôs her deal?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a 6-year-old Staffy. She was surrendered to us after she attacked the other household dog. Owner said it was unprovoked. We just got her in and haven‚Äôt tested her with anyone yet, but being a surrender, especially with a history of aggression, she‚Äôs at the top of the chopping block,‚Äù Isaac went on. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not suited for shelter life. She‚Äôs terrified back there, looking for her owner. She‚Äôs not doing well.‚Äù A look of pity came over the officer‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúWell, that does sound like my type.‚Äù Liam sighed, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go get her.‚Äù

Isaac led him down the corridor, jingling his keys as he walked. Chain-link kennels lined the hallway, each with its own melody ‚Äî tail thumps, claws on concrete, dogs of every size vocalizing their displeasure for their confinement. At the end of the row was another chain link gate, but no face waiting behind. It wasn‚Äôt until the men were right in front of the gate that Liam saw her: a tan huddle of dog, curled behind the elevated cot, facing away from the gate. She didn‚Äôt look up when they approached, even when Liam knelt and tapped the gate, she lay still.

‚ÄúThis is Chips,‚Äù the officer said.

Liam smiled. ‚ÄúChips,‚Äù he said softly through the chain link. The dog‚Äôs ear twitched, but she didn‚Äôt turn. 

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been through it,‚Äù Isaac went on. ‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs sweet. I know she‚Äôs missing her person. She needs out of here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll take her.‚Äù

 

As they walked back toward the front, Chips stepping hesitantly at his side, Liam‚Äôs phone buzzed in his coat pocket. He shifted the leash to his left hand and fished it out.

‚ÄúHey, Ren√©e. Yeah, I got her. We‚Äôre heading out now. I‚Äôll update you when I get her home,‚Äù and after a brief response from the other end, he ended the call and dropped the cell phone back into his coat pocket.

From behind him, a woman‚Äôs voice called out. ‚ÄúRen√©e from APOD?‚Äù

She was standing near the front desk, bundled in a navy hoodie with the All Paws on Deck logo stitched on the chest. He noticed her eyes first, blue and bright, like they were carved from stained glass ‚Äî her blonde hair was styled in two French braid pigtails, streaked with a hint of pink.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my boss,‚Äù the woman said, stepping forward. ‚ÄúWell, sort of. I‚Äôm a volunteer with APOD. Faith.‚Äù She held out her hand to Liam.

Liam took her hand in his, her grip firmer than he was expecting, ‚ÄúLiam.‚Äù

She glanced down at Chips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one with the nice barn setup out at the Run, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard of you. Ren√©e says you‚Äôve got a good eye for the rough cases.‚Äù

He shrugged. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not so rough once you get to know them. You just gotta hear their side of the story sometimes.‚Äù

Faith smiled up at him, her blue eyes clear and inviting, ‚ÄúI see why Ren√©e spoke so highly of you.‚Äù

Liam looked at her‚Äîreally looked. She seemed so at ease in a place filled with fear and sorrow. She knew this place front to back. He had a feeling Faith could name every animal in here, without a moment‚Äôs hesitation. She radiated with determination and confidence.

‚ÄúYou come out in this snow just to clean kennels?‚Äù he asked.

She smiled, one corner of her mouth curled up, ‚ÄúDogs don‚Äôt get snow days.‚Äù‚ÄÉ",2,1746412423.0,creativewriting,1,1.0,False

Long story short he has always told me that faithfulness to him is very important. And since we were sexual very early on in the relationship he asked me if I watched any porn or looked at any in general I answered that no I don't since I never really liked it nor was interested in it. After that he told me that he'd like it to stay like that since we were in it for the long run he wanted that both of us be exclusive to each other not just physically but also mentally and emotionally. Of course to me this sounded amazing and nothing really happened that was until this January. We were both going through a very stressful time at school despite that though I made an effort to visit him still often and bring him food and so that he could have time to relax. I even made him a exam survival kit filled with his fav coffees, snacks, and even some school materials I knew he needed. The same day I gave it to him we made out and just stopped ourselves from having sex because I knew he needed to get work done. Once I got home we hopped on a call but suddenly I had the urge to go through his google account (he logged it into my laptop himself early on in the relationship) I scrolled only once and saw him searching for ""hot girls"" that were nude on reddit. My heart immediately sank because all trust I had seemingly went away. And when I looked at the time stamp of the search it was at 4pm I left his house at around 3:50pm so while I was heading home he was doing that behind my back.

Fast forward we've talked about it and I've went to counselling and therapy for it because it really did kind of kill something inside me. He's been a good bf since he hasn't done anything wrong but I still can't help having resentment towards him.

**At the Mill Tonight**

The high school wasn‚Äôt much to look at,The walls were chipped in places, the floors worn smooth from years of students walking the same halls. We all knew each other¬† at least, that‚Äôs how it felt. You couldn‚Äôt walk down the hallway without seeing the same faces, the same half-smiles from kids who‚Äôd been in your class since kindergarten. Some days, I didn‚Äôt mind it. There was actually a lot of comfort in knowing everyone. Mr. Blue, who talked about the weather like it was the most interesting subject on earth, Mrs. Malone, who wore the same cardigan every day, never seemed to notice when kids weren‚Äôt paying attention, and somehow seemed to be pregnant every single year she taught English. I didn‚Äôt have to think much about my family either. Mom stayed home and made dinner, Dad worked at the library, and my brother, Kyle, went off to college, he was barely home enough to talk to even before that anyway. The same bus ride every morning, the same group of friends who gathered at the same diner after school.¬† Nothing ever changed, which was comfortable like a blanket knitted by someone's elderly grandma, and so mind numbingly boring that I casually thought about walking into the lake every Tuesday night and never walking out again.¬†

	

That Tuesday was no different. I slid into my usual seat on the bus, second row from the back, knees against the cracked vinyl, earphones in but no music playing. Casey dropped into the seat across from me, his father‚Äôs russet skin sharply contrasted by his mother‚Äôs strawberry blond hair. His sparsely freckled face adorned with his usual grin, sharp and a little too wide,the kind that always made you feel like you‚Äôd missed the joke. He was the kind of person you just fell in with, without remembering how it started. One day he was peeling labels off soda bottles at the diner; the next he was leaning against your locker, showing up at the lake with a stolen six-pack and some half-baked dubious plan for the night.

Bri sat up front, pressed against the window, tracing little spirals in the fog on the glass. Nate and Jordan piled in next, laughing about something that had happened in the gym, shoving each other as they squeezed down the aisle. We all had our places in a little drifting orbit,barely different day to day, like planets circling a sun.

The bus rattled along the familiar route, past the corner store, the old cemetery, the turnoff toward the hills. I barely noticed it anymore. Casey tapped his foot against the seat in front of him, humming something under his breath, something I didn‚Äôt recognize. It was one of those mornings when everything felt a little too bright, the air a little too crisp, like the world was waiting for something to happen or maybe that‚Äôs colored by hindsight, either way by the end of Saturday October 15th, 2016 Casey would be dead.¬†

	Like every other Tuesday the cafeteria smelled like overcooked fries and bleach. I sat on the edge of our usual table, picking at the crust of my sandwich, half-listening, half-floating somewhere just behind my own eyes.

Brooksie was in full rant mode, soccer jersey tied around her waist, an apple in one hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, if Coach benches me again for ‚Äòattitude,‚Äô I‚Äôm done. I swear I‚Äôll walk.‚ÄùAcross the table, Casey smirked, balancing a fork on the tip of his finger.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, sure. You‚Äôd miss the applause too much.‚ÄùBrooksie shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass.¬†

‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm not failing bio, genius.‚Äù Casey flashed his signature grin at that.¬†

‚ÄúC-plus is basically a B if you squint.‚Äù

Wren was half-hidden behind their sketchbook, charcoal on their fingers, eyes flicking up now and then to check on me. I could feel it before they even said anything. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Wren asked quietly, tilting their head just enough to catch my eye.

I pulled my mouth into something that was supposed to be a smile. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a headache.‚Äù That low hum in my skull had been there all morning, under the noise of lockers slamming, teachers droning, feet scuffing linoleum.

Nico dropped into the seat beside me so hard his tray nearly slid off the table. ‚ÄúGuys, guys, you won‚Äôt believe this, did you know the old mill on Lockhart used to be a quarantine site? Like, actual plague quarantine. In *this* town.‚Äù His voice dipped lower, like he was unveiling a great conspiracy.

Brooksie groaned. ‚ÄúNico. Please.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm serious! I found this archive page‚Äù

¬†Brooksie cut in,‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going ghost hunting at the mill,‚Äù crunching into her apple like punctuation.¬†

But Casey‚Äôs eyes lit up.‚ÄúWait. Why not?‚Äù

Wren let out a soft, resigned sigh.‚ÄúThink about it,‚Äù Casey leaned in, elbows on the table, voice all bright mischief. ‚ÄúFriday night. No parents. Flashlights. Creepy abandoned building. Come *on*. It‚Äôs basically a rite of passage.‚Äù

Brooksie tossed her hands up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so predictable.‚Äù

I rolled a piece of sandwich crust between my fingers, feeling that quiet thrum under everything, like something pacing just out of sight. ‚ÄúLiza?‚Äù Wren‚Äôs voice pulled me back. They were all looking at me now. Brooksie. Nico. and Casey, with that grin.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Sure,‚Äù I heard myself say somewhere in the distance. ‚ÄúWhy not.‚Äù

Casey let out a victorious whoop, slapping the table. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the row of cafeteria windows.¬†

	He¬† caught me by my locker right before the last bell, looking like he always did too comfortable in his own skin, like he had all the time in the world to make sure everyone knew it. His elbow rested against the row of lockers as if the whole hallway belonged to him.¬†

‚ÄúHey‚Äù he said, flipping a set of keys around his finger with a practiced, bored motion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking you up after dinner, cool?‚Äù

I paused, sliding my books into my bag, eyes focused on the half-scribbled note I‚Äôd left for myself earlier. Could I even go? Mom would have a fit. But then again, I hadn‚Äôt been able to say no to Casey in months.

I nodded, biting my lip. ‚ÄúCool.‚Äù

He leaned closer, his shoulder brushing against the cold metal of the lockers, his voice low. ‚ÄúJust so you know, I‚Äôm not taking ‚Äòno‚Äô for an answer. So, don‚Äôt chicken out on me.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my face neutral. ‚ÄúNot planning on it.‚Äù

But my stomach fluttered in that annoying, nervous way. Not from the idea of sneaking out¬† I‚Äôd done it before, always with a bit of adrenaline and excitement which was, to no one's surprise, rare around here. It was him. There was something about the way he looked at me, like he was waiting for something, expecting it, and I hated that it made me feel like I was standing on the edge of something without knowing if I was going to jump or not.

His grin widened, though it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. They were distracted, flicking toward the doors where the bell was already ringing. ‚ÄúGood. Don‚Äôt make me chase you down.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, but there was a lump in my throat I couldn‚Äôt swallow down. Instead, I shoved my books into my bag a little harder than necessary, just to distract myself. I managed a weak smile, watching him disappear down the hall. My thoughts raced ahead of me, jumping from one thing to another. I pushed most of them aside though. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like I was digging myself into a hole I wasn‚Äôt sure how to get out of anyway. I grabbed my bag, hoisted it over my shoulder, and shoved my way through the crowded hallway as the final bell rang. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was already in too deep. And, for once, Casey wasn‚Äôt going to be the only one getting us all in trouble.

My mom was standing in the kitchen, wearing that apron she always wore when she cooked, the one that had strawberries all over it and was starting to look a little faded at the edges. She didn‚Äôt look up when I entered, her back turned as she worked on something at the stove. I took a deep breath before I spoke.

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I said, my voice a little hesitant, but I pushed through it. ‚ÄúCan I have a sleepover at Brooksie‚Äôs tonight?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt turn around immediately, and for a second, I thought she hadn‚Äôt heard me.

‚ÄúLiza, it‚Äôs a school night,‚Äù she said, her voice already tightening with that tone she used when she wasn‚Äôt in the mood to argue. ‚ÄúYou need to be home. We‚Äôve already tried this before and you were two hours late for school.‚Äù

I bit my lip, trying not to let the frustration show on my face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one night, Mom. We‚Äôre not doing anything crazy. We‚Äôre just hanging out.‚Äù

She finally turned to face me, wiping her hands on the towel. There was a flicker of disbelief in her eyes. ‚Äú You‚Äôre already on edge with your grades. This is *exactly* the kind of thing I‚Äôve been warning you about, Liza.‚Äù

I could feel my frustration rising. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking for much. I just want one night to relax. I‚Äôve been doing everything you‚Äôve asked me to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even start with that.‚Äù She shook her head, the edge in her voice growing sharper. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just keep just making excuses and expecting the world to pave the way for you on its own sweetheart you‚Äôve gotta put in some actual work here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making excuses,‚Äù I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a sleepover. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going out to party or something.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightening into a thin line. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a *school night*, Liza. You have responsibilities. This is not a joke.‚ÄùI opened my mouth to argue, but she held up a hand, cutting me off.

‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre not going. End of discussion.‚Äù

I felt my chest tighten, the pressure building. I needed to get out. My thoughts spun, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt just stay here. There was no way I was staying home tonight‚Äînot when Casey was waiting for me.

‚ÄúMom, please,‚Äù I tried again, my voice softer, but she wasn‚Äôt having it.

‚ÄúNo. Absolutely not.‚Äù She folded her arms across her chest, that finality in her tone that meant there was no room for negotiation.

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat. She didn‚Äôt understand. She never did.

Without thinking, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to my room,‚Äù I muttered, trying to hide the irritation in my voice.

‚ÄúYou can stay in your room, but you‚Äôre *not* leaving this house,‚Äù she called after me.

I slammed my bedroom door behind me, the sound reverberating in the quiet house. My heart was pounding, but I had a plan. I wasn‚Äôt going to stay here, not tonight.

Later that night, at 12:07 A.M., I yanked my bag out from under the bed, not caring if it was messy. I needed to move fast.

I packed quickly. I grabbed my phone and texted Casey at 12:10 A.M.

*I‚Äôll meet you in ten minutes.*

I could already feel the rush of adrenaline starting to take over.¬† My mom wouldn‚Äôt notice until it was too late. I crept over to the window and slowly cracked it open. The cool evening air hit me, and I could hear the distant hum of the neighborhood, the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

I could do this.

I climbed out the window, holding my breath as I gently pulled myself onto the roof. I kept low, praying my parents wouldn‚Äôt hear me. The moonlight illuminated the path ahead of me, the familiar street stretching out like an open invitation to freedom. I dropped down to the grass below, the soft thud of my feet against the ground muffled by the cool night. My heart was racing as I made my way down the street, heading for Casey‚Äôs truck.

It wasn‚Äôt until I rounded the corner and saw the truck parked a few houses down that I allowed myself to breathe again. Casey was leaning against the side of the truck, looking like he was ready to roll his eyes at the whole situation. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, the same one he wore every night.

‚ÄúAbout time,‚Äù he said with a grin, pushing off the truck as I approached.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just slipped into the passenger seat, tossing my bag next to me. Casey closed the door behind me, and we pulled away, the engine of the truck rumbling to life.

For a second, the tension in my chest eased. I‚Äôd made it. I was out.

I stared ahead, the dark streets rolling by, but my mind was still racing. Casey didn‚Äôt say anything at first, but then he glanced over at me, his smile fading just a little.

‚ÄúSo, you really snuck out?‚Äù he asked quietly, like he was unsure if it was a joke or something serious.

I nodded, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI had to. She wouldn‚Äôt let me go.‚Äù

Casey chuckled softly, but there was a strange tension in his voice.¬†

I turned to look at him, the moonlight catching the sharp angles of his face. ‚ÄúWell, sometimes you have to. You don‚Äôt always get to do what you want, do you?‚Äù

He was silent for a moment, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Then, he finally said, ‚ÄúYeah. I guess you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

For a moment, there was a strange kind of weight between us, like something was about to be said but never quite reached the surface. Instead, the truck‚Äôs headlights sliced through the darkness, and we drove on, the quiet stretching between us.

The truck hummed as it sped down the darkened streets, the glow of the dashboard casting a soft light over the two of us. The silence wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly easy either. Casey's hands gripped the wheel, his knuckles slightly white as he drove. I could hear the faint rhythm of his foot tapping on the pedal, like he was trying to drown out the quiet.

I could feel it, though. The tension. It was like there was something hanging in the air, something both of us were avoiding but both knew was there. I could feel it building with every second of silence between us.

Finally, Casey cleared his throat, but didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúSo, uh... what happens if your mom finds out?‚Äù

I shrugged, trying to keep things casual. ""She won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs fine.""

He glanced at me then, just for a second, like he was trying to figure out if I was lying or if I really believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre brave, sneaking out like that.‚Äù

I smirked, trying to hide how my chest tightened with his attention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly scared of my mom,‚Äù I said, but my voice felt thin. Like it wasn‚Äôt quite me.

Casey grinned a little, but his eyes were still glued to the road. ‚ÄúYeah, well, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be the one to explain it to her,‚Äù he muttered under his breath, but then there was a pause, one that dragged on longer than I expected.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd care that much if she knew,‚Äù I said quietly, and I could feel the words sink between us, heavy and awkward. There was something in the way he was looking at the road‚Äîsomething that told me he wasn‚Äôt just looking at the road.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders tight. Then he laughed, but it wasn‚Äôt the usual carefree laugh. It was a little strained, like he was trying to make light of something that wasn‚Äôt light at all. ‚ÄúYeah, well, it‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not about her, is it?‚Äù he said, voice dropping a little, like he was testing the words as they left his mouth.

I turned to face him, suddenly feeling like my heart had skipped a beat. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

He avoided my gaze again, running a hand through his hair, his fingers tugging at the strands like he was trying to pull the right words out. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Äî‚Äù He let out a shaky breath and, for a moment, I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt going to say anything at all.

But then, almost too quietly, he said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want you to get in trouble for something dumb. You know?‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to piece together what he was actually trying to say. I knew Casey. He wasn‚Äôt usually like this. And I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if he was talking about me sneaking out or something else entirely. Something I hadn‚Äôt expected.

His grip on the wheel tightened again, and I could feel the space between us stretch out, too wide to ignore now. His voice dropped even lower, almost too soft for me to hear. ‚ÄúI just‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want you to... I mean, not to get hurt or whatever, but also...‚Äù

I tilted my head, frowning. ‚ÄúCasey... what are you trying to say?‚Äù

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might actually admit it. That he might say whatever it was that was crawling under the surface, the thing neither of us had ever said out loud. But then his shoulders slumped, and he gave me a half-smile, the kind he always gave when he was trying to play it off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Forget it,‚Äù he said, his voice a little too casual.

And just like that, the moment slipped away, like water through my fingers. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the sting of it, though. He had almost said it, whatever *it* was. But in the end, he didn‚Äôt.

We drove on in silence after that, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between us, but neither of us had the guts to bring it up again.

Maybe next time.

The truck slowed as we neared the mill, the familiar outline of the old building in the thick wooded area looming ahead in the darkness. We climbed out of the truck and walked toward the others, who were already gathered near the front of the mill. The group stood in a loose circle, their faces illuminated by the dim light of a few flashlights they‚Äôd brought along.

The gravel crunched under our shoes as Casey and I approached the group huddled near the mill‚Äôs rusted double doors. The place looked worse than I remembered,its roof sagging like a spine too long bent, windows like blank eyes staring out at nothing. The air smelled of wet wood, rust, and something fainter, something off,like dried blood soaked into old earth.

Nico was already halfway through a retelling of the mill‚Äôs cursed history, waving his flashlight like a sword. ‚Äúand they say if you step through the northern doorway at midnight, the ghosts of the quarantined patients will follow you out.‚Äù

Brooksie rolled her eyes so hard I could practically hear it. ‚ÄúNico, if I get tetanus from this dump, I‚Äôm blaming you and your sixth-grade ghost stories.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a story,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *documented*. There were, like, plague doctors and everything‚Äîactual masks. One guy apparently walled himself in. They found bones.‚Äù

Casey smirked and tossed a rock at Nico‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúThen maybe you can join him, if the floor gives out.‚Äù

Wren stood with her arms crossed, hoodie zipped up to her chin covering her platinum bleached hair which stood out like a sore thumb against everyones black clothing, she eyed the building like it might lunge at her. ‚ÄúSo how exactly are we getting in? Those doors look like they‚Äôve been rusted shut since the Cold War.‚Äù

‚ÄúBack window,‚Äù Casey said smoothly, already moving toward the side of the building. ‚ÄúNear the northeast corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd just how are we going to open-‚Äù Casey interrupted her sentence by throwing a large stone through the window.¬†

I followed behind them, the beam of my flashlight catching on twisted ivy, broken shingles, and graffiti-scrawled concrete. The others trailed close, their chatter dying as we rounded the side of the building and the woods pressed in around us.

Casey stopped by a warped piece of plywood half-covering a jagged window just above shoulder height. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, gesturing like a magician revealing the trick. ‚ÄúOne of you boosts me, and then I‚Äôll pull everyone else up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is it always you first?‚Äù Wren asked softly, but there wasn‚Äôt real resistance in their voice.

Casey shot them a wink. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm charming, and you‚Äôd miss me just the right amount if I disappeared.‚Äù

He handed me his flashlight and set a foot against the wall. I knelt instinctively, threading my fingers together for a boost. He stepped up and pushed himself through the window with practiced ease, vanishing into the darkness with a faint grunt and the sound of old wood creaking.

There was a pause.

Then a *click*.

The side door creaked open an inch.

‚ÄúHey look at that!‚Äù He boasted triumphantly. ‚ÄúNow I don‚Äôt have to touch any of you.‚Äù¬†

Everyone shuffled inside, grimacing at the failed comedian we‚Äôd brought along, flashlights sweeping the dark interior. The air was heavier here, the smell of dust, mildew, and something older like scorched metal. My stomach tightened.

Inside, the mill was skeletal. Rotting beams framed the long-dead heart of the building, broken furniture lay scattered like old bones, and somewhere above, something dripped steadily‚Äî*plip... plip... plip*‚Äîlike a leaky faucet in a house long abandoned.

Nico took point, already narrating again. ‚ÄúLegend says this place was condemned after a fever outbreak in 1906. They say‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNico,‚Äù Brooksie cut in. ‚ÄúShut up and help us figure out where we‚Äôre going before you summon something by accident.‚Äù

Casey lifted his flashlight, its beam landing on a spiral staircase at the far end of the room, half-swallowed by shadow. ‚ÄúUp there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old loft. Probably the safest place to sit and drink this sad excuse for beer.‚Äù

He patted the backpack slung over his shoulder, and Brooksie raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you even *get* beer?‚Äù

Casey grinned. ‚ÄúNico‚Äôs older brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Nico objected.

We gathered near the base of the stairs, debating whether they‚Äôd hold our weight. Nico gave the first step an experimental bounce, then climbed three steps before turning back. ‚ÄúStable enough,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt all come up at once.‚Äù

One by one, we followed him, Wren‚Äôs hand brushing mine briefly as we ascended. They offered a faint smile, the kind they saved for when they were worried and wanted someone to worry with them so they didn‚Äôt feel alone.

The loft creaked ominously but held. A shattered window let in a shaft of moonlight, pale and cold. The group sat in a rough circle on crates, torn tarps, or the floor. Casey passed out warm cans of beer, and Nico launched into yet another urban legend. This time a staple of the area,¬† about some man who goes crazy when he finds his wife cheating on him and murders her and their children, But of course inside an abandoned Steel Mill¬† the story didn‚Äôt exactly feel casual.

It felt like waiting.

Like holding your breath before something breaks.

I leaned back against the wall, can untouched, my fingers brushing the floor where something sticky clung to the wood¬† rust maybe. The scent of burnt sweetness curled faintly into the air.

I stiffened.

The others didn‚Äôt seem to notice. But something shifted behind my eyes, a memory tugging at the edges of the present.

That smell again. Burnt sugar.

Wet iron.

And somewhere outside, just beyond the walls, I swore I heard it quiet, distant

**Laughter.**

Just for a second.

Then it was gone.

**Thunderstorms**

Wren looked up sharply. ‚ÄúDid anyone else hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Nico asked, halfway through some gory twist in his ghost story.

‚ÄúThat scraping sound.‚Äù And there it was¬† slow, deliberate, something dragging itself across concrete somewhere below us.

‚ÄúRats?‚Äù Nico offered, but even he sounded unsure.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Brooksie said, standing. ‚ÄúNope. No rats make *that* noise.‚Äù

We all went quiet.

The sound came again. Closer. Louder. Not skittering like claws scraping, like rusted nails across steel.

Then a thump. Heavy. Like something fell.

We all jumped.

Casey swung his flashlight toward the staircase, but it barely pierced the black. ‚ÄúYou guys heard that, right?‚Äù

Brooksie muttered, ‚ÄúI knew this was a stupid idea.‚Äù She looked at me angrily.¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even say anything,‚Äù I shot back.

‚ÄúYeah, but you‚Äôve been weird all day. You knew something was off. And you still said yes.‚Äù

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. ‚ÄúOh, so now this is my fault?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you and Casey came in here like it was a date night‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, *what?*‚Äù Casey said, cutting in.

Wren stepped between us. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not do this now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Brooksie said, pointing at me. ‚ÄúShe dragged us into this. She‚Äôs been off for weeks moping around, acting like she‚Äôs haunted or something. And now *this* place feels like it‚Äôs watching us and we‚Äôre just supposed to pretend it‚Äôs fine?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair,‚Äù Wren said quietly, but the damage was done.

Brooksie grabbed her bag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out. I don‚Äôt care if we have to hike through the woods. I‚Äôm not staying in here to get cursed or possessed or whatever this is.‚Äù

Nico stood too, clearly spooked. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm with her. I came for some spooky vibes, not a seance.‚Äù

Wren lingered, looking between me and casey. ‚ÄúDo you want me to stay?‚Äù

I almost said yes. But Casey hadn‚Äôt moved. His face was tight, unreadable, his flashlight beam frozen on the stairs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust... get them out safe?‚Äù

Wren nodded slowly, then disappeared down the stairs with the rest.

Suddenly, the silence was sharp.

Casey exhaled. ‚ÄúThat got intense.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck. ‚ÄúBrooksie‚Äôs always like that when she‚Äôs scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not wrong though. That noise wasn‚Äôt nothing.‚Äù

We both went still.

Below us something moved. Not scraping this time. Footsteps. Measured. One step. Pause. Another.

Casey‚Äôs eyes locked on mine. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone down there.‚Äù

My blood went cold. ‚ÄúThen why are they not using a light?‚Äù

We both crouched low. Casey shut off his flashlight. The only light now came from the moon, stretched long across the floor like cold fingers.

The footsteps stopped. Right at the base of the stairs.

We waited.

And then

**tap**.	 **tap**.	 **Tap**.

Something began to climb.

Casey grabbed my hand.

I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd reached for him first.

‚ÄúLiza,‚Äù he whispered, breath warm against my ear, ‚Äúwe need to move.‚Äù

We backed toward the far side of the loft. No floorboards creaked beneath our feet, like the building wanted silence.

The tapping got louder.¬†

Closer.

We ducked behind an old workbench and dropped low.

I turned to him, my voice barely there. ‚ÄúWhatever this is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it wants the others.‚Äù

He looked at me. ‚ÄúYou think it wants *us*?‚Äù

And then something **laughed**.

Right at the top of the stairs.

A voice like static and syrup.

But when Casey stood up and shone his flashlight toward the sound

There was nothing there.

Just dust. Just silence. We ran.

Not down the stairs, not at first. Just away. Across the loft, away from that spot at the top of the staircase where the laughter had curled into the air like smoke.

Casey pulled me with him, flashlight bouncing in jerky arcs across the broken floor, throwing long shadows that moved when we didn‚Äôt. The beam stuttered over splintered wood, old crates, rusted machinery but nothing human. Nothing solid. Just that sound behind us.

Dragging. Scraping.¬†

Low and wrong and echoing from places it shouldn‚Äôt reach.

We hit the opposite edge of the loft, and Casey turned in a tight circle, scanning for another way down.

‚ÄúLadder!‚Äù he hissed, pointing to a rusted fire escape ladder bolted crookedly against the far wall. Half the rungs looked ready to give under a sneeze, but it was that or go back toward the stairs.

We didn‚Äôt hesitate.

I went first, my palms slick on the cold metal, heart pounding so loud I thought it might give us away.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back,‚Äù Casey murmured above me. ‚ÄúJust go.‚Äù

A sound split the air sharp, high-pitched, like metal tearing in half. Screeching.

My foot slipped on a rung slick with rain, but Casey caught me before I fell.

We hit the ground behind the mill and didn‚Äôt stop running.

The woods loomed dark and close, branches clawing at our arms, brambles catching on our jeans. We crashed through them, blind and breathless. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled, and the sky cracked open.

Rain began to fall in cold sheets.

I didn‚Äôt look behind us. I couldn‚Äôt. Every instinct in me screamed not to turn around, not to give it shape by seeing it. But I felt it. In my bones. Breathing down our necks. Smiling**.**

We hit the clearing by the old drainage pipe and turned hard. Mud sucked at my shoes, my jacket plastered to my skin. The rain turned everything to black glass, every tree a silhouette twisted wrong. Casey‚Äôs hand was still gripping mine like a lifeline.

The truck was just ahead.

A bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the hill and for a split second, in the space between thunder and breath, I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

Tall.¬†

Too tall.

Head tilted. Limbs too long. Like a man whose skin didn‚Äôt quite fit.Then darkness swallowed it again.

Casey unlocked the truck with shaking hands and we dove inside, slamming the doors, locking them immediately. The moment the truck was sealed up, the rain turned violent sheets of it crashing onto the windshield, thunder rattling the frame.

We sat there, panting, soaked, staring out into the woods like it might crawl into the cab next.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Did you see‚Äù Casey started.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I cut him off, voice cracking.¬†

He swallowed, nodded once.

The interior lights flickered. My breath fogged the window.

‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù I asked suddenly.

Casey‚Äôs eyes went wide. He leaned forward, scanning the lot, the road, the trees. ‚ÄúThey were supposed to head back,‚Äù he said, voice too tight, too quiet. But there was nothing. No shapes in the dark. No flashlights. No footsteps in the mud outside the truck but ours. The world outside was just rain and trees and shadows that didn‚Äôt move right. I felt a sharp jolt of panic seize my chest. ‚ÄúCasey,‚Äù I said, voice barely audible over the downpour, ‚ÄúWhere the hell are they?‚Äù

The truck was still parked at the edge of the lot, headlights off, rain blurring everything outside into watercolors. The only light came from the dashboard‚Äôs faint glow and Casey‚Äôs phone screen, which he kept checking every few seconds like maybe someone would materialize just by him staring hard enough. I‚Äôd peeled off my jacket and draped it over my lap, water soaking into the seat beneath me. My fingers were numb. My teeth wouldn‚Äôt stop chattering. They were *gone*. The others. Brooksie, Wren, Nico. No lights, no shouting our names, no tracks in the mud. Just the woods. Just that thing.

Just us.

I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes and tried to breathe. One. Two. Three. Don‚Äôt think about it. Don‚Äôt,

Casey‚Äôs phone buzzed.

He jumped like someone had slammed the hood, then turned the screen toward himself.

And froze.

‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù I asked, my voice hoarse.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, uh. It‚Äôs Wren.‚Äù

I leaned in as he read out loud:

**Wren:** hey. you two good? **Wren:** we made it home like 20 min ago. **Wren:** didn‚Äôt see you leave. was kinda worried.

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúTwenty‚Ä¶ twenty *minutes* ago?‚Äù

Casey looked at the clock on the dash. 1:41 a.m.

We‚Äôd only left the mill *maybe* fifteen minutes ago. Maybe. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù he muttered, thumbs already tapping out a response.

**Casey:** wait what?? we just got to the truck. storm‚Äôs insane. thought you were still inside.

The reply came fast.

**Wren:** what? **Wren:** we left before it even started raining. Nico said you two were right behind us.

Casey and I looked at each other, the same sick understanding blooming between us.

They‚Äôd left *before* the rain started.

But it had been pouring‚Äî*slamming*‚Äîby the time we even hit the woods. The downpour had chased us the whole way.

Casey stared at the screen, then typed something else.

**Casey:** When did you leave exactly?

A few seconds passed. Another buzz.

**Wren:** idk exactly. like 1?? maybe a little before **Wren:** definitely before the rain started. **Wren:** why?

I swallowed hard.

**One.**

We were *still in the loft* at one. I‚Äôd seen it on my phone right before we heard the knocking.

And then we heard it again.

And again.

Casey dropped his phone into the center console like it had burned him. Rain hammered the roof above us, steady and unrelenting.

I didn‚Äôt speak.

I couldn‚Äôt.

Because something about this felt wrong.

Like the forest had changed the rules. Bent time. Bent *us*.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

**Brooksie:** u alive or what **Brooksie:** Nico says he saw something in the rearview **Brooksie:** said it was tall af. hope it wasn‚Äôt you lol

I stared at it.

Read it again.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Casey?‚Äù I said, barely more than a whisper.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we should leave. *Now.*‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt argue. Just turned the key, the engine rumbling back to life. The headlights cut through the rain, casting long, spidery shadows through the trees.

And as we pulled onto the road, I checked the rearview mirror.

Nothing followed us.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it had *let* us go.

For now.

The truck‚Äôs heater kicked in about five minutes after we hit the road, and I started to feel my toes again. My jeans squished every time I shifted, and the seatbelt strap was sticking to my damp neck.

Casey kept looking at the road like it had personally betrayed him.

We‚Äôd barely spoken since pulling away from the mill, except for a few grunts and one dramatic ‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù when a raccoon darted across the road and nearly gave us both matching heart attacks.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take the silence anymore.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I said, teeth still chattering a little. ‚ÄúOn a scale of one to existential crisis, how dead do you think we should be right now?‚Äù

He let out a short, unsteady laugh. ‚ÄúNegative three. Like we entered a different plane of reality and shouldn‚Äôt *exist* anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúSame page.‚Äù

Another beat of silence. Then:

‚ÄúDo you think this counts as a first date?‚Äù he asked, completely straight-faced.

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Äù He gestured vaguely at the soaked truck, the empty road, his own shirt still clinging to him like a sad dishrag. ‚ÄúCreepy building, shared trauma, adrenaline. You literally grabbed my hand while we were being chased by... I dunno. Tim Burton‚Äôs wet dream ,He paused, I‚Äôm just saying, you climbed out your window and risked death for me. That‚Äôs at least coffee-worthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said we were going ghost hunting,‚Äù I deadpanned. ‚ÄúWe found actual ghosts. You *owe* me coffee.‚Äù

He let out a loud, relieved laugh. It echoed in the cab like it didn‚Äôt know whether to be joy or hysteria.

I laughed too‚Äîbig and sudden‚Äîuntil I was doubled over, wiping tears from my face.

‚ÄúThis is the dumbest night of my life,‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúWorse than homecoming sophomore year?‚Äù

‚ÄúI broke my heel and got gum in my hair this *wins* by a landslide.‚Äù

Casey reached over, still smiling, and nudged my arm gently. ‚ÄúHey. Seriously, though... thanks for not freaking out on me.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI *did* freak out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but like. In a manageable, *deeply* charming way.‚Äù

I turned toward him, still smiling. He looked back at me for half a second too long before snapping his eyes back to the road, suddenly sheepish.

‚ÄúYou are, uh...‚Äù He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúA lot braver than you think.‚Äù

My smile faded to something softer. My heart did a weird somersault I blamed entirely on adrenaline.

‚ÄúSame to you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEven if your ‚Äòbravery‚Äô looks suspiciously like poor decision-making.‚Äù

‚ÄúI contain multitudes.‚Äù

We were quiet for a few more seconds. The rain was starting to let up. Steam fogged the windows, and the world outside looked sleepy and unfamiliar.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I said eventually, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre either trauma bonded or this is the beginning of a really weird love story.‚Äù

Casey grinned. ‚ÄúWhy not both?‚Äù I rolled my eyes, but it didn‚Äôt stop the warmth from creeping into my chest.¬†

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I stuttered out. ‚ÄúCan we just park the truck somewhere, I don‚Äôt think I can be alone yet.‚Äù I stutter the words out nervously. He eyes me cautiously before turning the opposite direction of my house. ‚ÄúCasey please tell me you didn‚Äôt take that to mean I wanted to go to the old cemetery right now?‚Äù I mutter in disbelief.

‚ÄúActually we are going to the cemetery and I am a genius because even the cops don't want to go over that direction this late at night.‚Äù He says confidently as he slows down to drive on the twisty dirt road leading toward the gray pillar gravestones. I put my hands on my face, beginning to regret having said anything at all as he parks the truck and looks over at me expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he leans his head in my general direction, ‚Äúfor someone who isn't usually much of a risk taker you've sure had one hell of a night.‚Äù A soft breathy laugh escapes before I can make any effort to hold it in. He sees this as some kind of opportunity to reach forward and move a lock of my hair behind my ear. My eyes open wide, like a deer caught in a semi-trucks headlights.¬†

‚ÄúCasey, I really hope you‚Äôre not trying to do what I think you‚Äôre trying to do because this is a piss-poor time to do it.‚Äù He smirked an unforgettable smirk, an ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember this for 20 years‚Äù smirk. Of course he did.¬†

‚ÄúThen when should I do it Liz?‚Äù The question is rhetorical. He leans in and kisses me regardless.¬†

His lips were warmer than I expected, soft, hesitant at first, like he was giving me a chance to pull away. I didn‚Äôt. Maybe I should‚Äôve. Maybe five hours ago I would‚Äôve. But now?

Now I was in a fogged-up truck, parked in a haunted cemetery, soaked to the bone, having barely outrun something I couldn‚Äôt explain and Casey¬† was kissing me like it was the one thing in the world that still made sense.

My hands moved without thinking, one curling into the fabric of his hoodie, the other finding the side of his neck, damp skin and too-fast pulse under my palm. He leaned in harder at that, shifting closer until the gearshift jabbed him in the hip and made both of us laugh against each other‚Äôs mouths.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really bad at logistics,‚Äù I murmured, breathless, forehead pressed to his.

‚ÄúI never claimed to be good at logistics,‚Äù he muttered, already leaning back in.

This time it wasn‚Äôt hesitant. His mouth was insistent, hungry not desperate exactly, but like we‚Äôd both been teetering on a ledge for too long and finally decided to jump. His hand came up to cup my cheek, thumb brushing just beneath my eye, grounding and gentle in a way that made my stomach flip.

I pulled him closer, not even thinking, knees bending under me so I could shift half into his lap. The truck‚Äôs cab was suddenly too small, the air too warm, my heart way too loud.

His hands found my waist, tentative like he was still asking permission even now. That made something in my chest go soft, sore in the best possible way.

We broke apart for air, just barely, our faces still close enough that I could feel his breath against my lips.

He grinned, all teeth, all trouble. ‚Äú I stand by that being a first date.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insufferable,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù he murmured, pressing another kiss to the corner of my mouth, ‚Äúhere you are.‚Äù

I could‚Äôve kissed him again. I wanted to. But then something in the shadows shifted, probably just wind, or maybe the groan of an old oak tree and both of us flinched like idiots.

We stared at the foggy window for a beat, hearts still racing.

Then Casey whispered, ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs enough horny-in-a-haunted-graveyard for one night.‚Äù

I snorted, flopping back into my seat. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre putting that on my tombstone when this all eventually kills us.‚Äù

Not the big things,not the night at the barn, not the grave, not even the woods,but that thin, bitter reek of burnt sugar and wet iron. I remember it clinging to his¬† jacket in the days before he changed, seeping under my door at night, thickening in the rain. Some nights, I still hear him laughing out there, in the dark, somewhere I can‚Äôt follow.*



**At the Mill Tonight**

The high school wasn‚Äôt much to look at,The walls were chipped in places, the floors worn smooth from years of students walking the same halls. We all knew each other¬† at least, that‚Äôs how it felt. You couldn‚Äôt walk down the hallway without seeing the same faces, the same half-smiles from kids who‚Äôd been in your class since kindergarten. Some days, I didn‚Äôt mind it. There was actually a lot of comfort in knowing everyone. Mr. Blue, who talked about the weather like it was the most interesting subject on earth, Mrs. Malone, who wore the same cardigan every day, never seemed to notice when kids weren‚Äôt paying attention, and somehow seemed to be pregnant every single year she taught English. I didn‚Äôt have to think much about my family either. Mom stayed home and made dinner, Dad worked at the library, and my brother, Kyle, went off to college, he was barely home enough to talk to even before that anyway. The same bus ride every morning, the same group of friends who gathered at the same diner after school.¬† Nothing ever changed, which was comfortable like a blanket knitted by someone's elderly grandma, and so mind numbingly boring that I casually thought about walking into the lake every Tuesday night and never walking out again.¬†

	

That Tuesday was no different. I slid into my usual seat on the bus, second row from the back, knees against the cracked vinyl, earphones in but no music playing. Casey dropped into the seat across from me, his father‚Äôs russet skin sharply contrasted by his mother‚Äôs strawberry blond hair. His sparsely freckled face adorned with his usual grin, sharp and a little too wide,the kind that always made you feel like you‚Äôd missed the joke. He was the kind of person you just fell in with, without remembering how it started. One day he was peeling labels off soda bottles at the diner; the next he was leaning against your locker, showing up at the lake with a stolen six-pack and some half-baked dubious plan for the night.

Bri sat up front, pressed against the window, tracing little spirals in the fog on the glass. Nate and Jordan piled in next, laughing about something that had happened in the gym, shoving each other as they squeezed down the aisle. We all had our places in a little drifting orbit,barely different day to day, like planets circling a sun.

The bus rattled along the familiar route, past the corner store, the old cemetery, the turnoff toward the hills. I barely noticed it anymore. Casey tapped his foot against the seat in front of him, humming something under his breath, something I didn‚Äôt recognize. It was one of those mornings when everything felt a little too bright, the air a little too crisp, like the world was waiting for something to happen or maybe that‚Äôs colored by hindsight, either way by the end of Saturday October 15th, 2016 Casey would be dead.¬†

	Like every other Tuesday the cafeteria smelled like overcooked fries and bleach. I sat on the edge of our usual table, picking at the crust of my sandwich, half-listening, half-floating somewhere just behind my own eyes.

Brooksie was in full rant mode, soccer jersey tied around her waist, an apple in one hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, if Coach benches me again for ‚Äòattitude,‚Äô I‚Äôm done. I swear I‚Äôll walk.‚ÄùAcross the table, Casey smirked, balancing a fork on the tip of his finger.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, sure. You‚Äôd miss the applause too much.‚ÄùBrooksie shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass.¬†

‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm not failing bio, genius.‚Äù Casey flashed his signature grin at that.¬†

‚ÄúC-plus is basically a B if you squint.‚Äù

Wren was half-hidden behind their sketchbook, charcoal on their fingers, eyes flicking up now and then to check on me. I could feel it before they even said anything. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Wren asked quietly, tilting their head just enough to catch my eye.

I pulled my mouth into something that was supposed to be a smile. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a headache.‚Äù That low hum in my skull had been there all morning, under the noise of lockers slamming, teachers droning, feet scuffing linoleum.

Nico dropped into the seat beside me so hard his tray nearly slid off the table. ‚ÄúGuys, guys, you won‚Äôt believe this, did you know the old mill on Lockhart used to be a quarantine site? Like, actual plague quarantine. In *this* town.‚Äù His voice dipped lower, like he was unveiling a great conspiracy.

Brooksie groaned. ‚ÄúNico. Please.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm serious! I found this archive page‚Äù

¬†Brooksie cut in,‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going ghost hunting at the mill,‚Äù crunching into her apple like punctuation.¬†

But Casey‚Äôs eyes lit up.‚ÄúWait. Why not?‚Äù

Wren let out a soft, resigned sigh.‚ÄúThink about it,‚Äù Casey leaned in, elbows on the table, voice all bright mischief. ‚ÄúFriday night. No parents. Flashlights. Creepy abandoned building. Come *on*. It‚Äôs basically a rite of passage.‚Äù

Brooksie tossed her hands up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so predictable.‚Äù

I rolled a piece of sandwich crust between my fingers, feeling that quiet thrum under everything, like something pacing just out of sight. ‚ÄúLiza?‚Äù Wren‚Äôs voice pulled me back. They were all looking at me now. Brooksie. Nico. and Casey, with that grin.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Sure,‚Äù I heard myself say somewhere in the distance. ‚ÄúWhy not.‚Äù

Casey let out a victorious whoop, slapping the table. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the row of cafeteria windows.¬†

	He¬† caught me by my locker right before the last bell, looking like he always did too comfortable in his own skin, like he had all the time in the world to make sure everyone knew it. His elbow rested against the row of lockers as if the whole hallway belonged to him.¬†

‚ÄúHey‚Äù he said, flipping a set of keys around his finger with a practiced, bored motion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking you up after dinner, cool?‚Äù

I paused, sliding my books into my bag, eyes focused on the half-scribbled note I‚Äôd left for myself earlier. Could I even go? Mom would have a fit. But then again, I hadn‚Äôt been able to say no to Casey in months.

I nodded, biting my lip. ‚ÄúCool.‚Äù

He leaned closer, his shoulder brushing against the cold metal of the lockers, his voice low. ‚ÄúJust so you know, I‚Äôm not taking ‚Äòno‚Äô for an answer. So, don‚Äôt chicken out on me.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my face neutral. ‚ÄúNot planning on it.‚Äù

But my stomach fluttered in that annoying, nervous way. Not from the idea of sneaking out¬† I‚Äôd done it before, always with a bit of adrenaline and excitement which was, to no one's surprise, rare around here. It was him. There was something about the way he looked at me, like he was waiting for something, expecting it, and I hated that it made me feel like I was standing on the edge of something without knowing if I was going to jump or not.

His grin widened, though it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. They were distracted, flicking toward the doors where the bell was already ringing. ‚ÄúGood. Don‚Äôt make me chase you down.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, but there was a lump in my throat I couldn‚Äôt swallow down. Instead, I shoved my books into my bag a little harder than necessary, just to distract myself. I managed a weak smile, watching him disappear down the hall. My thoughts raced ahead of me, jumping from one thing to another. I pushed most of them aside though. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like I was digging myself into a hole I wasn‚Äôt sure how to get out of anyway. I grabbed my bag, hoisted it over my shoulder, and shoved my way through the crowded hallway as the final bell rang. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was already in too deep. And, for once, Casey wasn‚Äôt going to be the only one getting us all in trouble.

My mom was standing in the kitchen, wearing that apron she always wore when she cooked, the one that had strawberries all over it and was starting to look a little faded at the edges. She didn‚Äôt look up when I entered, her back turned as she worked on something at the stove. I took a deep breath before I spoke.

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I said, my voice a little hesitant, but I pushed through it. ‚ÄúCan I have a sleepover at Brooksie‚Äôs tonight?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt turn around immediately, and for a second, I thought she hadn‚Äôt heard me.

‚ÄúLiza, it‚Äôs a school night,‚Äù she said, her voice already tightening with that tone she used when she wasn‚Äôt in the mood to argue. ‚ÄúYou need to be home. We‚Äôve already tried this before and you were two hours late for school.‚Äù

I bit my lip, trying not to let the frustration show on my face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one night, Mom. We‚Äôre not doing anything crazy. We‚Äôre just hanging out.‚Äù

She finally turned to face me, wiping her hands on the towel. There was a flicker of disbelief in her eyes. ‚Äú You‚Äôre already on edge with your grades. This is *exactly* the kind of thing I‚Äôve been warning you about, Liza.‚Äù

I could feel my frustration rising. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking for much. I just want one night to relax. I‚Äôve been doing everything you‚Äôve asked me to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even start with that.‚Äù She shook her head, the edge in her voice growing sharper. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just keep just making excuses and expecting the world to pave the way for you on its own sweetheart you‚Äôve gotta put in some actual work here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making excuses,‚Äù I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a sleepover. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going out to party or something.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightening into a thin line. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a *school night*, Liza. You have responsibilities. This is not a joke.‚ÄùI opened my mouth to argue, but she held up a hand, cutting me off.

‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre not going. End of discussion.‚Äù

I felt my chest tighten, the pressure building. I needed to get out. My thoughts spun, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt just stay here. There was no way I was staying home tonight‚Äînot when Casey was waiting for me.

‚ÄúMom, please,‚Äù I tried again, my voice softer, but she wasn‚Äôt having it.

‚ÄúNo. Absolutely not.‚Äù She folded her arms across her chest, that finality in her tone that meant there was no room for negotiation.

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat. She didn‚Äôt understand. She never did.

Without thinking, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to my room,‚Äù I muttered, trying to hide the irritation in my voice.

‚ÄúYou can stay in your room, but you‚Äôre *not* leaving this house,‚Äù she called after me.

I slammed my bedroom door behind me, the sound reverberating in the quiet house. My heart was pounding, but I had a plan. I wasn‚Äôt going to stay here, not tonight.

Later that night, at 12:07 A.M., I yanked my bag out from under the bed, not caring if it was messy. I needed to move fast.

I packed quickly. I grabbed my phone and texted Casey at 12:10 A.M.

*I‚Äôll meet you in ten minutes.*

I could already feel the rush of adrenaline starting to take over.¬† My mom wouldn‚Äôt notice until it was too late. I crept over to the window and slowly cracked it open. The cool evening air hit me, and I could hear the distant hum of the neighborhood, the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

I could do this.

I climbed out the window, holding my breath as I gently pulled myself onto the roof. I kept low, praying my parents wouldn‚Äôt hear me. The moonlight illuminated the path ahead of me, the familiar street stretching out like an open invitation to freedom. I dropped down to the grass below, the soft thud of my feet against the ground muffled by the cool night. My heart was racing as I made my way down the street, heading for Casey‚Äôs truck.

It wasn‚Äôt until I rounded the corner and saw the truck parked a few houses down that I allowed myself to breathe again. Casey was leaning against the side of the truck, looking like he was ready to roll his eyes at the whole situation. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, the same one he wore every night.

‚ÄúAbout time,‚Äù he said with a grin, pushing off the truck as I approached.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just slipped into the passenger seat, tossing my bag next to me. Casey closed the door behind me, and we pulled away, the engine of the truck rumbling to life.

For a second, the tension in my chest eased. I‚Äôd made it. I was out.

I stared ahead, the dark streets rolling by, but my mind was still racing. Casey didn‚Äôt say anything at first, but then he glanced over at me, his smile fading just a little.

‚ÄúSo, you really snuck out?‚Äù he asked quietly, like he was unsure if it was a joke or something serious.

I nodded, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI had to. She wouldn‚Äôt let me go.‚Äù

Casey chuckled softly, but there was a strange tension in his voice.¬†

I turned to look at him, the moonlight catching the sharp angles of his face. ‚ÄúWell, sometimes you have to. You don‚Äôt always get to do what you want, do you?‚Äù

He was silent for a moment, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Then, he finally said, ‚ÄúYeah. I guess you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

For a moment, there was a strange kind of weight between us, like something was about to be said but never quite reached the surface. Instead, the truck‚Äôs headlights sliced through the darkness, and we drove on, the quiet stretching between us.

The truck hummed as it sped down the darkened streets, the glow of the dashboard casting a soft light over the two of us. The silence wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly easy either. Casey's hands gripped the wheel, his knuckles slightly white as he drove. I could hear the faint rhythm of his foot tapping on the pedal, like he was trying to drown out the quiet.

I could feel it, though. The tension. It was like there was something hanging in the air, something both of us were avoiding but both knew was there. I could feel it building with every second of silence between us.

Finally, Casey cleared his throat, but didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúSo, uh... what happens if your mom finds out?‚Äù

I shrugged, trying to keep things casual. ""She won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs fine.""

He glanced at me then, just for a second, like he was trying to figure out if I was lying or if I really believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre brave, sneaking out like that.‚Äù

I smirked, trying to hide how my chest tightened with his attention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly scared of my mom,‚Äù I said, but my voice felt thin. Like it wasn‚Äôt quite me.

Casey grinned a little, but his eyes were still glued to the road. ‚ÄúYeah, well, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be the one to explain it to her,‚Äù he muttered under his breath, but then there was a pause, one that dragged on longer than I expected.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd care that much if she knew,‚Äù I said quietly, and I could feel the words sink between us, heavy and awkward. There was something in the way he was looking at the road‚Äîsomething that told me he wasn‚Äôt just looking at the road.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders tight. Then he laughed, but it wasn‚Äôt the usual carefree laugh. It was a little strained, like he was trying to make light of something that wasn‚Äôt light at all. ‚ÄúYeah, well, it‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not about her, is it?‚Äù he said, voice dropping a little, like he was testing the words as they left his mouth.

I turned to face him, suddenly feeling like my heart had skipped a beat. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

He avoided my gaze again, running a hand through his hair, his fingers tugging at the strands like he was trying to pull the right words out. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Äî‚Äù He let out a shaky breath and, for a moment, I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt going to say anything at all.

But then, almost too quietly, he said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want you to get in trouble for something dumb. You know?‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to piece together what he was actually trying to say. I knew Casey. He wasn‚Äôt usually like this. And I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if he was talking about me sneaking out or something else entirely. Something I hadn‚Äôt expected.

His grip on the wheel tightened again, and I could feel the space between us stretch out, too wide to ignore now. His voice dropped even lower, almost too soft for me to hear. ‚ÄúI just‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want you to... I mean, not to get hurt or whatever, but also...‚Äù

I tilted my head, frowning. ‚ÄúCasey... what are you trying to say?‚Äù

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might actually admit it. That he might say whatever it was that was crawling under the surface, the thing neither of us had ever said out loud. But then his shoulders slumped, and he gave me a half-smile, the kind he always gave when he was trying to play it off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Forget it,‚Äù he said, his voice a little too casual.

And just like that, the moment slipped away, like water through my fingers. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the sting of it, though. He had almost said it, whatever *it* was. But in the end, he didn‚Äôt.

We drove on in silence after that, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between us, but neither of us had the guts to bring it up again.

Maybe next time.

The truck slowed as we neared the mill, the familiar outline of the old building in the thick wooded area looming ahead in the darkness. We climbed out of the truck and walked toward the others, who were already gathered near the front of the mill. The group stood in a loose circle, their faces illuminated by the dim light of a few flashlights they‚Äôd brought along.

The gravel crunched under our shoes as Casey and I approached the group huddled near the mill‚Äôs rusted double doors. The place looked worse than I remembered,its roof sagging like a spine too long bent, windows like blank eyes staring out at nothing. The air smelled of wet wood, rust, and something fainter, something off,like dried blood soaked into old earth.

Nico was already halfway through a retelling of the mill‚Äôs cursed history, waving his flashlight like a sword. ‚Äúand they say if you step through the northern doorway at midnight, the ghosts of the quarantined patients will follow you out.‚Äù

Brooksie rolled her eyes so hard I could practically hear it. ‚ÄúNico, if I get tetanus from this dump, I‚Äôm blaming you and your sixth-grade ghost stories.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a story,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *documented*. There were, like, plague doctors and everything‚Äîactual masks. One guy apparently walled himself in. They found bones.‚Äù

Casey smirked and tossed a rock at Nico‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúThen maybe you can join him, if the floor gives out.‚Äù

Wren stood with her arms crossed, hoodie zipped up to her chin covering her platinum bleached hair which stood out like a sore thumb against everyones black clothing, she eyed the building like it might lunge at her. ‚ÄúSo how exactly are we getting in? Those doors look like they‚Äôve been rusted shut since the Cold War.‚Äù

‚ÄúBack window,‚Äù Casey said smoothly, already moving toward the side of the building. ‚ÄúNear the northeast corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd just how are we going to open-‚Äù Casey interrupted her sentence by throwing a large stone through the window.¬†

I followed behind them, the beam of my flashlight catching on twisted ivy, broken shingles, and graffiti-scrawled concrete. The others trailed close, their chatter dying as we rounded the side of the building and the woods pressed in around us.

Casey stopped by a warped piece of plywood half-covering a jagged window just above shoulder height. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, gesturing like a magician revealing the trick. ‚ÄúOne of you boosts me, and then I‚Äôll pull everyone else up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is it always you first?‚Äù Wren asked softly, but there wasn‚Äôt real resistance in their voice.

Casey shot them a wink. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm charming, and you‚Äôd miss me just the right amount if I disappeared.‚Äù

He handed me his flashlight and set a foot against the wall. I knelt instinctively, threading my fingers together for a boost. He stepped up and pushed himself through the window with practiced ease, vanishing into the darkness with a faint grunt and the sound of old wood creaking.

There was a pause.

Then a *click*.

The side door creaked open an inch.

‚ÄúHey look at that!‚Äù He boasted triumphantly. ‚ÄúNow I don‚Äôt have to touch any of you.‚Äù¬†

Everyone shuffled inside, grimacing at the failed comedian we‚Äôd brought along, flashlights sweeping the dark interior. The air was heavier here, the smell of dust, mildew, and something older like scorched metal. My stomach tightened.

Inside, the mill was skeletal. Rotting beams framed the long-dead heart of the building, broken furniture lay scattered like old bones, and somewhere above, something dripped steadily‚Äî*plip... plip... plip*‚Äîlike a leaky faucet in a house long abandoned.

Nico took point, already narrating again. ‚ÄúLegend says this place was condemned after a fever outbreak in 1906. They say‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNico,‚Äù Brooksie cut in. ‚ÄúShut up and help us figure out where we‚Äôre going before you summon something by accident.‚Äù

Casey lifted his flashlight, its beam landing on a spiral staircase at the far end of the room, half-swallowed by shadow. ‚ÄúUp there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old loft. Probably the safest place to sit and drink this sad excuse for beer.‚Äù

He patted the backpack slung over his shoulder, and Brooksie raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you even *get* beer?‚Äù

Casey grinned. ‚ÄúNico‚Äôs older brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Nico objected.

We gathered near the base of the stairs, debating whether they‚Äôd hold our weight. Nico gave the first step an experimental bounce, then climbed three steps before turning back. ‚ÄúStable enough,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt all come up at once.‚Äù

One by one, we followed him, Wren‚Äôs hand brushing mine briefly as we ascended. They offered a faint smile, the kind they saved for when they were worried and wanted someone to worry with them so they didn‚Äôt feel alone.

The loft creaked ominously but held. A shattered window let in a shaft of moonlight, pale and cold. The group sat in a rough circle on crates, torn tarps, or the floor. Casey passed out warm cans of beer, and Nico launched into yet another urban legend. This time a staple of the area,¬† about some man who goes crazy when he finds his wife cheating on him and murders her and their children, But of course inside an abandoned Steel Mill¬† the story didn‚Äôt exactly feel casual.

It felt like waiting.

Like holding your breath before something breaks.

I leaned back against the wall, can untouched, my fingers brushing the floor where something sticky clung to the wood¬† rust maybe. The scent of burnt sweetness curled faintly into the air.

I stiffened.

The others didn‚Äôt seem to notice. But something shifted behind my eyes, a memory tugging at the edges of the present.

That smell again. Burnt sugar.

Wet iron.

And somewhere outside, just beyond the walls, I swore I heard it quiet, distant

**Laughter.**

Just for a second.

Then it was gone.

**Thunderstorms**

Wren looked up sharply. ‚ÄúDid anyone else hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Nico asked, halfway through some gory twist in his ghost story.

‚ÄúThat scraping sound.‚Äù And there it was¬† slow, deliberate, something dragging itself across concrete somewhere below us.

‚ÄúRats?‚Äù Nico offered, but even he sounded unsure.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Brooksie said, standing. ‚ÄúNope. No rats make *that* noise.‚Äù

We all went quiet.

The sound came again. Closer. Louder. Not skittering like claws scraping, like rusted nails across steel.

Then a thump. Heavy. Like something fell.

We all jumped.

Casey swung his flashlight toward the staircase, but it barely pierced the black. ‚ÄúYou guys heard that, right?‚Äù

Brooksie muttered, ‚ÄúI knew this was a stupid idea.‚Äù She looked at me angrily.¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even say anything,‚Äù I shot back.

‚ÄúYeah, but you‚Äôve been weird all day. You knew something was off. And you still said yes.‚Äù

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. ‚ÄúOh, so now this is my fault?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you and Casey came in here like it was a date night‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, *what?*‚Äù Casey said, cutting in.

Wren stepped between us. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not do this now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Brooksie said, pointing at me. ‚ÄúShe dragged us into this. She‚Äôs been off for weeks moping around, acting like she‚Äôs haunted or something. And now *this* place feels like it‚Äôs watching us and we‚Äôre just supposed to pretend it‚Äôs fine?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair,‚Äù Wren said quietly, but the damage was done.

Brooksie grabbed her bag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out. I don‚Äôt care if we have to hike through the woods. I‚Äôm not staying in here to get cursed or possessed or whatever this is.‚Äù

Nico stood too, clearly spooked. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm with her. I came for some spooky vibes, not a seance.‚Äù

Wren lingered, looking between me and casey. ‚ÄúDo you want me to stay?‚Äù

I almost said yes. But Casey hadn‚Äôt moved. His face was tight, unreadable, his flashlight beam frozen on the stairs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust... get them out safe?‚Äù

Wren nodded slowly, then disappeared down the stairs with the rest.

Suddenly, the silence was sharp.

Casey exhaled. ‚ÄúThat got intense.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck. ‚ÄúBrooksie‚Äôs always like that when she‚Äôs scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not wrong though. That noise wasn‚Äôt nothing.‚Äù

We both went still.

Below us something moved. Not scraping this time. Footsteps. Measured. One step. Pause. Another.

Casey‚Äôs eyes locked on mine. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone down there.‚Äù

My blood went cold. ‚ÄúThen why are they not using a light?‚Äù

We both crouched low. Casey shut off his flashlight. The only light now came from the moon, stretched long across the floor like cold fingers.

The footsteps stopped. Right at the base of the stairs.

We waited.

And then

**tap**.	 **tap**.	 **Tap**.

Something began to climb.

Casey grabbed my hand.

I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd reached for him first.

‚ÄúLiza,‚Äù he whispered, breath warm against my ear, ‚Äúwe need to move.‚Äù

We backed toward the far side of the loft. No floorboards creaked beneath our feet, like the building wanted silence.

The tapping got louder.¬†

Closer.

We ducked behind an old workbench and dropped low.

I turned to him, my voice barely there. ‚ÄúWhatever this is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it wants the others.‚Äù

He looked at me. ‚ÄúYou think it wants *us*?‚Äù

And then something **laughed**.

Right at the top of the stairs.

A voice like static and syrup.

But when Casey stood up and shone his flashlight toward the sound

There was nothing there.

Just dust. Just silence. We ran.

Not down the stairs, not at first. Just away. Across the loft, away from that spot at the top of the staircase where the laughter had curled into the air like smoke.

Casey pulled me with him, flashlight bouncing in jerky arcs across the broken floor, throwing long shadows that moved when we didn‚Äôt. The beam stuttered over splintered wood, old crates, rusted machinery but nothing human. Nothing solid. Just that sound behind us.

Dragging. Scraping.¬†

Low and wrong and echoing from places it shouldn‚Äôt reach.

We hit the opposite edge of the loft, and Casey turned in a tight circle, scanning for another way down.

‚ÄúLadder!‚Äù he hissed, pointing to a rusted fire escape ladder bolted crookedly against the far wall. Half the rungs looked ready to give under a sneeze, but it was that or go back toward the stairs.

We didn‚Äôt hesitate.

I went first, my palms slick on the cold metal, heart pounding so loud I thought it might give us away.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back,‚Äù Casey murmured above me. ‚ÄúJust go.‚Äù

A sound split the air sharp, high-pitched, like metal tearing in half. Screeching.

My foot slipped on a rung slick with rain, but Casey caught me before I fell.

We hit the ground behind the mill and didn‚Äôt stop running.

The woods loomed dark and close, branches clawing at our arms, brambles catching on our jeans. We crashed through them, blind and breathless. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled, and the sky cracked open.

Rain began to fall in cold sheets.

I didn‚Äôt look behind us. I couldn‚Äôt. Every instinct in me screamed not to turn around, not to give it shape by seeing it. But I felt it. In my bones. Breathing down our necks. Smiling**.**

We hit the clearing by the old drainage pipe and turned hard. Mud sucked at my shoes, my jacket plastered to my skin. The rain turned everything to black glass, every tree a silhouette twisted wrong. Casey‚Äôs hand was still gripping mine like a lifeline.

The truck was just ahead.

A bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the hill and for a split second, in the space between thunder and breath, I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

Tall.¬†

Too tall.

Head tilted. Limbs too long. Like a man whose skin didn‚Äôt quite fit.Then darkness swallowed it again.

Casey unlocked the truck with shaking hands and we dove inside, slamming the doors, locking them immediately. The moment the truck was sealed up, the rain turned violent sheets of it crashing onto the windshield, thunder rattling the frame.

We sat there, panting, soaked, staring out into the woods like it might crawl into the cab next.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Did you see‚Äù Casey started.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I cut him off, voice cracking.¬†

He swallowed, nodded once.

The interior lights flickered. My breath fogged the window.

‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù I asked suddenly.

Casey‚Äôs eyes went wide. He leaned forward, scanning the lot, the road, the trees. ‚ÄúThey were supposed to head back,‚Äù he said, voice too tight, too quiet. But there was nothing. No shapes in the dark. No flashlights. No footsteps in the mud outside the truck but ours. The world outside was just rain and trees and shadows that didn‚Äôt move right. I felt a sharp jolt of panic seize my chest. ‚ÄúCasey,‚Äù I said, voice barely audible over the downpour, ‚ÄúWhere the hell are they?‚Äù

The truck was still parked at the edge of the lot, headlights off, rain blurring everything outside into watercolors. The only light came from the dashboard‚Äôs faint glow and Casey‚Äôs phone screen, which he kept checking every few seconds like maybe someone would materialize just by him staring hard enough. I‚Äôd peeled off my jacket and draped it over my lap, water soaking into the seat beneath me. My fingers were numb. My teeth wouldn‚Äôt stop chattering. They were *gone*. The others. Brooksie, Wren, Nico. No lights, no shouting our names, no tracks in the mud. Just the woods. Just that thing.

Just us.

I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes and tried to breathe. One. Two. Three. Don‚Äôt think about it. Don‚Äôt,

Casey‚Äôs phone buzzed.

He jumped like someone had slammed the hood, then turned the screen toward himself.

And froze.

‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù I asked, my voice hoarse.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, uh. It‚Äôs Wren.‚Äù

I leaned in as he read out loud:

**Wren:** hey. you two good? **Wren:** we made it home like 20 min ago. **Wren:** didn‚Äôt see you leave. was kinda worried.

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúTwenty‚Ä¶ twenty *minutes* ago?‚Äù

Casey looked at the clock on the dash. 1:41 a.m.

We‚Äôd only left the mill *maybe* fifteen minutes ago. Maybe. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù he muttered, thumbs already tapping out a response.

**Casey:** wait what?? we just got to the truck. storm‚Äôs insane. thought you were still inside.

The reply came fast.

**Wren:** what? **Wren:** we left before it even started raining. Nico said you two were right behind us.

Casey and I looked at each other, the same sick understanding blooming between us.

They‚Äôd left *before* the rain started.

But it had been pouring‚Äî*slamming*‚Äîby the time we even hit the woods. The downpour had chased us the whole way.

Casey stared at the screen, then typed something else.

**Casey:** When did you leave exactly?

A few seconds passed. Another buzz.

**Wren:** idk exactly. like 1?? maybe a little before **Wren:** definitely before the rain started. **Wren:** why?

I swallowed hard.

**One.**

We were *still in the loft* at one. I‚Äôd seen it on my phone right before we heard the knocking.

And then we heard it again.

And again.

Casey dropped his phone into the center console like it had burned him. Rain hammered the roof above us, steady and unrelenting.

I didn‚Äôt speak.

I couldn‚Äôt.

Because something about this felt wrong.

Like the forest had changed the rules. Bent time. Bent *us*.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

**Brooksie:** u alive or what **Brooksie:** Nico says he saw something in the rearview **Brooksie:** said it was tall af. hope it wasn‚Äôt you lol

I stared at it.

Read it again.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Casey?‚Äù I said, barely more than a whisper.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we should leave. *Now.*‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt argue. Just turned the key, the engine rumbling back to life. The headlights cut through the rain, casting long, spidery shadows through the trees.

And as we pulled onto the road, I checked the rearview mirror.

Nothing followed us.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it had *let* us go.

For now.

The truck‚Äôs heater kicked in about five minutes after we hit the road, and I started to feel my toes again. My jeans squished every time I shifted, and the seatbelt strap was sticking to my damp neck.

Casey kept looking at the road like it had personally betrayed him.

We‚Äôd barely spoken since pulling away from the mill, except for a few grunts and one dramatic ‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù when a raccoon darted across the road and nearly gave us both matching heart attacks.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take the silence anymore.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I said, teeth still chattering a little. ‚ÄúOn a scale of one to existential crisis, how dead do you think we should be right now?‚Äù

He let out a short, unsteady laugh. ‚ÄúNegative three. Like we entered a different plane of reality and shouldn‚Äôt *exist* anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúSame page.‚Äù

Another beat of silence. Then:

‚ÄúDo you think this counts as a first date?‚Äù he asked, completely straight-faced.

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Äù He gestured vaguely at the soaked truck, the empty road, his own shirt still clinging to him like a sad dishrag. ‚ÄúCreepy building, shared trauma, adrenaline. You literally grabbed my hand while we were being chased by... I dunno. Tim Burton‚Äôs wet dream ,He paused, I‚Äôm just saying, you climbed out your window and risked death for me. That‚Äôs at least coffee-worthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said we were going ghost hunting,‚Äù I deadpanned. ‚ÄúWe found actual ghosts. You *owe* me coffee.‚Äù

He let out a loud, relieved laugh. It echoed in the cab like it didn‚Äôt know whether to be joy or hysteria.

I laughed too‚Äîbig and sudden‚Äîuntil I was doubled over, wiping tears from my face.

‚ÄúThis is the dumbest night of my life,‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúWorse than homecoming sophomore year?‚Äù

‚ÄúI broke my heel and got gum in my hair this *wins* by a landslide.‚Äù

Casey reached over, still smiling, and nudged my arm gently. ‚ÄúHey. Seriously, though... thanks for not freaking out on me.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI *did* freak out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but like. In a manageable, *deeply* charming way.‚Äù

I turned toward him, still smiling. He looked back at me for half a second too long before snapping his eyes back to the road, suddenly sheepish.

‚ÄúYou are, uh...‚Äù He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúA lot braver than you think.‚Äù

My smile faded to something softer. My heart did a weird somersault I blamed entirely on adrenaline.

‚ÄúSame to you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEven if your ‚Äòbravery‚Äô looks suspiciously like poor decision-making.‚Äù

‚ÄúI contain multitudes.‚Äù

We were quiet for a few more seconds. The rain was starting to let up. Steam fogged the windows, and the world outside looked sleepy and unfamiliar.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I said eventually, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre either trauma bonded or this is the beginning of a really weird love story.‚Äù

Casey grinned. ‚ÄúWhy not both?‚Äù I rolled my eyes, but it didn‚Äôt stop the warmth from creeping into my chest.¬†

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I stuttered out. ‚ÄúCan we just park the truck somewhere, I don‚Äôt think I can be alone yet.‚Äù I stutter the words out nervously. He eyes me cautiously before turning the opposite direction of my house. ‚ÄúCasey please tell me you didn‚Äôt take that to mean I wanted to go to the old cemetery right now?‚Äù I mutter in disbelief.

‚ÄúActually we are going to the cemetery and I am a genius because even the cops don't want to go over that direction this late at night.‚Äù He says confidently as he slows down to drive on the twisty dirt road leading toward the gray pillar gravestones. I put my hands on my face, beginning to regret having said anything at all as he parks the truck and looks over at me expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he leans his head in my general direction, ‚Äúfor someone who isn't usually much of a risk taker you've sure had one hell of a night.‚Äù A soft breathy laugh escapes before I can make any effort to hold it in. He sees this as some kind of opportunity to reach forward and move a lock of my hair behind my ear. My eyes open wide, like a deer caught in a semi-trucks headlights.¬†

‚ÄúCasey, I really hope you‚Äôre not trying to do what I think you‚Äôre trying to do because this is a piss-poor time to do it.‚Äù He smirked an unforgettable smirk, an ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember this for 20 years‚Äù smirk. Of course he did.¬†

‚ÄúThen when should I do it Liz?‚Äù The question is rhetorical. He leans in and kisses me regardless.¬†

His lips were warmer than I expected, soft, hesitant at first, like he was giving me a chance to pull away. I didn‚Äôt. Maybe I should‚Äôve. Maybe five hours ago I would‚Äôve. But now?

Now I was in a fogged-up truck, parked in a haunted cemetery, soaked to the bone, having barely outrun something I couldn‚Äôt explain and Casey¬† was kissing me like it was the one thing in the world that still made sense.

My hands moved without thinking, one curling into the fabric of his hoodie, the other finding the side of his neck, damp skin and too-fast pulse under my palm. He leaned in harder at that, shifting closer until the gearshift jabbed him in the hip and made both of us laugh against each other‚Äôs mouths.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really bad at logistics,‚Äù I murmured, breathless, forehead pressed to his.

‚ÄúI never claimed to be good at logistics,‚Äù he muttered, already leaning back in.

This time it wasn‚Äôt hesitant. His mouth was insistent, hungry not desperate exactly, but like we‚Äôd both been teetering on a ledge for too long and finally decided to jump. His hand came up to cup my cheek, thumb brushing just beneath my eye, grounding and gentle in a way that made my stomach flip.

I pulled him closer, not even thinking, knees bending under me so I could shift half into his lap. The truck‚Äôs cab was suddenly too small, the air too warm, my heart way too loud.

His hands found my waist, tentative like he was still asking permission even now. That made something in my chest go soft, sore in the best possible way.

We broke apart for air, just barely, our faces still close enough that I could feel his breath against my lips.

He grinned, all teeth, all trouble. ‚Äú I stand by that being a first date.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insufferable,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù he murmured, pressing another kiss to the corner of my mouth, ‚Äúhere you are.‚Äù

I could‚Äôve kissed him again. I wanted to. But then something in the shadows shifted, probably just wind, or maybe the groan of an old oak tree and both of us flinched like idiots.

We stared at the foggy window for a beat, hearts still racing.

Then Casey whispered, ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs enough horny-in-a-haunted-graveyard for one night.‚Äù

I snorted, flopping back into my seat. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre putting that on my tombstone when this all eventually kills us.‚Äù

**At the Mill Tonight**

The high school wasn‚Äôt much to look at,The walls were chipped in places, the floors worn smooth from years of students walking the same halls. We all knew each other¬† at least, that‚Äôs how it felt. You couldn‚Äôt walk down the hallway without seeing the same faces, the same half-smiles from kids who‚Äôd been in your class since kindergarten. Some days, I didn‚Äôt mind it. There was actually a lot of comfort in knowing everyone. Mr. Blue, who talked about the weather like it was the most interesting subject on earth, Mrs. Malone, who wore the same cardigan every day, never seemed to notice when kids weren‚Äôt paying attention, and somehow seemed to be pregnant every single year she taught English. I didn‚Äôt have to think much about my family either. Mom stayed home and made dinner, Dad worked at the library, and my brother, Kyle, went off to college, he was barely home enough to talk to even before that anyway. The same bus ride every morning, the same group of friends who gathered at the same diner after school.¬† Nothing ever changed, which was comfortable like a blanket knitted by someone's elderly grandma, and so mind numbingly boring that I casually thought about walking into the lake every Tuesday night and never walking out again.¬†

	

That Tuesday was no different. I slid into my usual seat on the bus, second row from the back, knees against the cracked vinyl, earphones in but no music playing. Casey dropped into the seat across from me, his father‚Äôs russet skin sharply contrasted by his mother‚Äôs strawberry blond hair. His sparsely freckled face adorned with his usual grin, sharp and a little too wide,the kind that always made you feel like you‚Äôd missed the joke. He was the kind of person you just fell in with, without remembering how it started. One day he was peeling labels off soda bottles at the diner; the next he was leaning against your locker, showing up at the lake with a stolen six-pack and some half-baked dubious plan for the night.

Bri sat up front, pressed against the window, tracing little spirals in the fog on the glass. Nate and Jordan piled in next, laughing about something that had happened in the gym, shoving each other as they squeezed down the aisle. We all had our places in a little drifting orbit,barely different day to day, like planets circling a sun.

The bus rattled along the familiar route, past the corner store, the old cemetery, the turnoff toward the hills. I barely noticed it anymore. Casey tapped his foot against the seat in front of him, humming something under his breath, something I didn‚Äôt recognize. It was one of those mornings when everything felt a little too bright, the air a little too crisp, like the world was waiting for something to happen or maybe that‚Äôs colored by hindsight, either way by the end of Saturday October 15th, 2016 Casey would be dead.¬†

	Like every other Tuesday the cafeteria smelled like overcooked fries and bleach. I sat on the edge of our usual table, picking at the crust of my sandwich, half-listening, half-floating somewhere just behind my own eyes.

Brooksie was in full rant mode, soccer jersey tied around her waist, an apple in one hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm telling you, if Coach benches me again for ‚Äòattitude,‚Äô I‚Äôm done. I swear I‚Äôll walk.‚ÄùAcross the table, Casey smirked, balancing a fork on the tip of his finger.¬†

‚ÄúYeah, sure. You‚Äôd miss the applause too much.‚ÄùBrooksie shot him a glare sharp enough to cut glass.¬†

‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm not failing bio, genius.‚Äù Casey flashed his signature grin at that.¬†

‚ÄúC-plus is basically a B if you squint.‚Äù

Wren was half-hidden behind their sketchbook, charcoal on their fingers, eyes flicking up now and then to check on me. I could feel it before they even said anything. ‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù Wren asked quietly, tilting their head just enough to catch my eye.

I pulled my mouth into something that was supposed to be a smile. ‚ÄúYeah. Just a headache.‚Äù That low hum in my skull had been there all morning, under the noise of lockers slamming, teachers droning, feet scuffing linoleum.

Nico dropped into the seat beside me so hard his tray nearly slid off the table. ‚ÄúGuys, guys, you won‚Äôt believe this, did you know the old mill on Lockhart used to be a quarantine site? Like, actual plague quarantine. In *this* town.‚Äù His voice dipped lower, like he was unveiling a great conspiracy.

Brooksie groaned. ‚ÄúNico. Please.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm serious! I found this archive page‚Äù

¬†Brooksie cut in,‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going ghost hunting at the mill,‚Äù crunching into her apple like punctuation.¬†

But Casey‚Äôs eyes lit up.‚ÄúWait. Why not?‚Äù

Wren let out a soft, resigned sigh.‚ÄúThink about it,‚Äù Casey leaned in, elbows on the table, voice all bright mischief. ‚ÄúFriday night. No parents. Flashlights. Creepy abandoned building. Come *on*. It‚Äôs basically a rite of passage.‚Äù

Brooksie tossed her hands up. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so predictable.‚Äù

I rolled a piece of sandwich crust between my fingers, feeling that quiet thrum under everything, like something pacing just out of sight. ‚ÄúLiza?‚Äù Wren‚Äôs voice pulled me back. They were all looking at me now. Brooksie. Nico. and Casey, with that grin.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Sure,‚Äù I heard myself say somewhere in the distance. ‚ÄúWhy not.‚Äù

Casey let out a victorious whoop, slapping the table. Outside, the wind picked up, rattling the row of cafeteria windows.¬†

	He¬† caught me by my locker right before the last bell, looking like he always did too comfortable in his own skin, like he had all the time in the world to make sure everyone knew it. His elbow rested against the row of lockers as if the whole hallway belonged to him.¬†

‚ÄúHey‚Äù he said, flipping a set of keys around his finger with a practiced, bored motion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm picking you up after dinner, cool?‚Äù

I paused, sliding my books into my bag, eyes focused on the half-scribbled note I‚Äôd left for myself earlier. Could I even go? Mom would have a fit. But then again, I hadn‚Äôt been able to say no to Casey in months.

I nodded, biting my lip. ‚ÄúCool.‚Äù

He leaned closer, his shoulder brushing against the cold metal of the lockers, his voice low. ‚ÄúJust so you know, I‚Äôm not taking ‚Äòno‚Äô for an answer. So, don‚Äôt chicken out on me.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow, trying to keep my face neutral. ‚ÄúNot planning on it.‚Äù

But my stomach fluttered in that annoying, nervous way. Not from the idea of sneaking out¬† I‚Äôd done it before, always with a bit of adrenaline and excitement which was, to no one's surprise, rare around here. It was him. There was something about the way he looked at me, like he was waiting for something, expecting it, and I hated that it made me feel like I was standing on the edge of something without knowing if I was going to jump or not.

His grin widened, though it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. They were distracted, flicking toward the doors where the bell was already ringing. ‚ÄúGood. Don‚Äôt make me chase you down.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt respond, but there was a lump in my throat I couldn‚Äôt swallow down. Instead, I shoved my books into my bag a little harder than necessary, just to distract myself. I managed a weak smile, watching him disappear down the hall. My thoughts raced ahead of me, jumping from one thing to another. I pushed most of them aside though. The more I thought about it, the more it felt like I was digging myself into a hole I wasn‚Äôt sure how to get out of anyway. I grabbed my bag, hoisted it over my shoulder, and shoved my way through the crowded hallway as the final bell rang. I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that I was already in too deep. And, for once, Casey wasn‚Äôt going to be the only one getting us all in trouble.

My mom was standing in the kitchen, wearing that apron she always wore when she cooked, the one that had strawberries all over it and was starting to look a little faded at the edges. She didn‚Äôt look up when I entered, her back turned as she worked on something at the stove. I took a deep breath before I spoke.

‚ÄúMom,‚Äù I said, my voice a little hesitant, but I pushed through it. ‚ÄúCan I have a sleepover at Brooksie‚Äôs tonight?‚Äù

She didn‚Äôt turn around immediately, and for a second, I thought she hadn‚Äôt heard me.

‚ÄúLiza, it‚Äôs a school night,‚Äù she said, her voice already tightening with that tone she used when she wasn‚Äôt in the mood to argue. ‚ÄúYou need to be home. We‚Äôve already tried this before and you were two hours late for school.‚Äù

I bit my lip, trying not to let the frustration show on my face. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just one night, Mom. We‚Äôre not doing anything crazy. We‚Äôre just hanging out.‚Äù

She finally turned to face me, wiping her hands on the towel. There was a flicker of disbelief in her eyes. ‚Äú You‚Äôre already on edge with your grades. This is *exactly* the kind of thing I‚Äôve been warning you about, Liza.‚Äù

I could feel my frustration rising. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking for much. I just want one night to relax. I‚Äôve been doing everything you‚Äôve asked me to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even start with that.‚Äù She shook her head, the edge in her voice growing sharper. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just keep just making excuses and expecting the world to pave the way for you on its own sweetheart you‚Äôve gotta put in some actual work here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making excuses,‚Äù I snapped, my voice louder than I intended. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a sleepover. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm going out to party or something.‚Äù

Her eyes narrowed, her lips tightening into a thin line. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a *school night*, Liza. You have responsibilities. This is not a joke.‚ÄùI opened my mouth to argue, but she held up a hand, cutting me off.

‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôre not going. End of discussion.‚Äù

I felt my chest tighten, the pressure building. I needed to get out. My thoughts spun, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt just stay here. There was no way I was staying home tonight‚Äînot when Casey was waiting for me.

‚ÄúMom, please,‚Äù I tried again, my voice softer, but she wasn‚Äôt having it.

‚ÄúNo. Absolutely not.‚Äù She folded her arms across her chest, that finality in her tone that meant there was no room for negotiation.

I stared at her, the words choking in my throat. She didn‚Äôt understand. She never did.

Without thinking, I turned on my heel and headed for the stairs. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to my room,‚Äù I muttered, trying to hide the irritation in my voice.

‚ÄúYou can stay in your room, but you‚Äôre *not* leaving this house,‚Äù she called after me.

I slammed my bedroom door behind me, the sound reverberating in the quiet house. My heart was pounding, but I had a plan. I wasn‚Äôt going to stay here, not tonight.

Later that night, at 12:07 A.M., I yanked my bag out from under the bed, not caring if it was messy. I needed to move fast.

I packed quickly. I grabbed my phone and texted Casey at 12:10 A.M.

*I‚Äôll meet you in ten minutes.*

I could already feel the rush of adrenaline starting to take over.¬† My mom wouldn‚Äôt notice until it was too late. I crept over to the window and slowly cracked it open. The cool evening air hit me, and I could hear the distant hum of the neighborhood, the soft rustle of leaves in the wind.

I could do this.

I climbed out the window, holding my breath as I gently pulled myself onto the roof. I kept low, praying my parents wouldn‚Äôt hear me. The moonlight illuminated the path ahead of me, the familiar street stretching out like an open invitation to freedom. I dropped down to the grass below, the soft thud of my feet against the ground muffled by the cool night. My heart was racing as I made my way down the street, heading for Casey‚Äôs truck.

It wasn‚Äôt until I rounded the corner and saw the truck parked a few houses down that I allowed myself to breathe again. Casey was leaning against the side of the truck, looking like he was ready to roll his eyes at the whole situation. His hands were shoved into the pockets of his hoodie, the same one he wore every night.

‚ÄúAbout time,‚Äù he said with a grin, pushing off the truck as I approached.

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just slipped into the passenger seat, tossing my bag next to me. Casey closed the door behind me, and we pulled away, the engine of the truck rumbling to life.

For a second, the tension in my chest eased. I‚Äôd made it. I was out.

I stared ahead, the dark streets rolling by, but my mind was still racing. Casey didn‚Äôt say anything at first, but then he glanced over at me, his smile fading just a little.

‚ÄúSo, you really snuck out?‚Äù he asked quietly, like he was unsure if it was a joke or something serious.

I nodded, my voice barely above a whisper. ‚ÄúI had to. She wouldn‚Äôt let me go.‚Äù

Casey chuckled softly, but there was a strange tension in his voice.¬†

I turned to look at him, the moonlight catching the sharp angles of his face. ‚ÄúWell, sometimes you have to. You don‚Äôt always get to do what you want, do you?‚Äù

He was silent for a moment, eyes fixed on the road ahead. Then, he finally said, ‚ÄúYeah. I guess you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

For a moment, there was a strange kind of weight between us, like something was about to be said but never quite reached the surface. Instead, the truck‚Äôs headlights sliced through the darkness, and we drove on, the quiet stretching between us.

The truck hummed as it sped down the darkened streets, the glow of the dashboard casting a soft light over the two of us. The silence wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable, but it wasn‚Äôt exactly easy either. Casey's hands gripped the wheel, his knuckles slightly white as he drove. I could hear the faint rhythm of his foot tapping on the pedal, like he was trying to drown out the quiet.

I could feel it, though. The tension. It was like there was something hanging in the air, something both of us were avoiding but both knew was there. I could feel it building with every second of silence between us.

Finally, Casey cleared his throat, but didn‚Äôt look at me. ‚ÄúSo, uh... what happens if your mom finds out?‚Äù

I shrugged, trying to keep things casual. ""She won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs fine.""

He glanced at me then, just for a second, like he was trying to figure out if I was lying or if I really believed it. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre brave, sneaking out like that.‚Äù

I smirked, trying to hide how my chest tightened with his attention. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly scared of my mom,‚Äù I said, but my voice felt thin. Like it wasn‚Äôt quite me.

Casey grinned a little, but his eyes were still glued to the road. ‚ÄúYeah, well, I wouldn‚Äôt want to be the one to explain it to her,‚Äù he muttered under his breath, but then there was a pause, one that dragged on longer than I expected.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd care that much if she knew,‚Äù I said quietly, and I could feel the words sink between us, heavy and awkward. There was something in the way he was looking at the road‚Äîsomething that told me he wasn‚Äôt just looking at the road.

He shifted in his seat, his shoulders tight. Then he laughed, but it wasn‚Äôt the usual carefree laugh. It was a little strained, like he was trying to make light of something that wasn‚Äôt light at all. ‚ÄúYeah, well, it‚Äôs, uh‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not about her, is it?‚Äù he said, voice dropping a little, like he was testing the words as they left his mouth.

I turned to face him, suddenly feeling like my heart had skipped a beat. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

He avoided my gaze again, running a hand through his hair, his fingers tugging at the strands like he was trying to pull the right words out. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs just‚Äî‚Äù He let out a shaky breath and, for a moment, I thought maybe he wasn‚Äôt going to say anything at all.

But then, almost too quietly, he said, ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want you to get in trouble for something dumb. You know?‚Äù

I stared at him, trying to piece together what he was actually trying to say. I knew Casey. He wasn‚Äôt usually like this. And I couldn‚Äôt quite tell if he was talking about me sneaking out or something else entirely. Something I hadn‚Äôt expected.

His grip on the wheel tightened again, and I could feel the space between us stretch out, too wide to ignore now. His voice dropped even lower, almost too soft for me to hear. ‚ÄúI just‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want you to... I mean, not to get hurt or whatever, but also...‚Äù

I tilted my head, frowning. ‚ÄúCasey... what are you trying to say?‚Äù

He hesitated, and for a moment, I thought he might actually admit it. That he might say whatever it was that was crawling under the surface, the thing neither of us had ever said out loud. But then his shoulders slumped, and he gave me a half-smile, the kind he always gave when he was trying to play it off.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing. Forget it,‚Äù he said, his voice a little too casual.

And just like that, the moment slipped away, like water through my fingers. I couldn‚Äôt help but feel the sting of it, though. He had almost said it, whatever *it* was. But in the end, he didn‚Äôt.

We drove on in silence after that, the weight of the unspoken words hanging between us, but neither of us had the guts to bring it up again.

Maybe next time.

The truck slowed as we neared the mill, the familiar outline of the old building in the thick wooded area looming ahead in the darkness. We climbed out of the truck and walked toward the others, who were already gathered near the front of the mill. The group stood in a loose circle, their faces illuminated by the dim light of a few flashlights they‚Äôd brought along.

The gravel crunched under our shoes as Casey and I approached the group huddled near the mill‚Äôs rusted double doors. The place looked worse than I remembered,its roof sagging like a spine too long bent, windows like blank eyes staring out at nothing. The air smelled of wet wood, rust, and something fainter, something off,like dried blood soaked into old earth.

Nico was already halfway through a retelling of the mill‚Äôs cursed history, waving his flashlight like a sword. ‚Äúand they say if you step through the northern doorway at midnight, the ghosts of the quarantined patients will follow you out.‚Äù

Brooksie rolled her eyes so hard I could practically hear it. ‚ÄúNico, if I get tetanus from this dump, I‚Äôm blaming you and your sixth-grade ghost stories.‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a story,‚Äù he insisted. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs *documented*. There were, like, plague doctors and everything‚Äîactual masks. One guy apparently walled himself in. They found bones.‚Äù

Casey smirked and tossed a rock at Nico‚Äôs feet. ‚ÄúThen maybe you can join him, if the floor gives out.‚Äù

Wren stood with her arms crossed, hoodie zipped up to her chin covering her platinum bleached hair which stood out like a sore thumb against everyones black clothing, she eyed the building like it might lunge at her. ‚ÄúSo how exactly are we getting in? Those doors look like they‚Äôve been rusted shut since the Cold War.‚Äù

‚ÄúBack window,‚Äù Casey said smoothly, already moving toward the side of the building. ‚ÄúNear the northeast corner.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd just how are we going to open-‚Äù Casey interrupted her sentence by throwing a large stone through the window.¬†

I followed behind them, the beam of my flashlight catching on twisted ivy, broken shingles, and graffiti-scrawled concrete. The others trailed close, their chatter dying as we rounded the side of the building and the woods pressed in around us.

Casey stopped by a warped piece of plywood half-covering a jagged window just above shoulder height. ‚ÄúHere,‚Äù he said, gesturing like a magician revealing the trick. ‚ÄúOne of you boosts me, and then I‚Äôll pull everyone else up.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is it always you first?‚Äù Wren asked softly, but there wasn‚Äôt real resistance in their voice.

Casey shot them a wink. ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm charming, and you‚Äôd miss me just the right amount if I disappeared.‚Äù

He handed me his flashlight and set a foot against the wall. I knelt instinctively, threading my fingers together for a boost. He stepped up and pushed himself through the window with practiced ease, vanishing into the darkness with a faint grunt and the sound of old wood creaking.

There was a pause.

Then a *click*.

The side door creaked open an inch.

‚ÄúHey look at that!‚Äù He boasted triumphantly. ‚ÄúNow I don‚Äôt have to touch any of you.‚Äù¬†

Everyone shuffled inside, grimacing at the failed comedian we‚Äôd brought along, flashlights sweeping the dark interior. The air was heavier here, the smell of dust, mildew, and something older like scorched metal. My stomach tightened.

Inside, the mill was skeletal. Rotting beams framed the long-dead heart of the building, broken furniture lay scattered like old bones, and somewhere above, something dripped steadily‚Äî*plip... plip... plip*‚Äîlike a leaky faucet in a house long abandoned.

Nico took point, already narrating again. ‚ÄúLegend says this place was condemned after a fever outbreak in 1906. They say‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNico,‚Äù Brooksie cut in. ‚ÄúShut up and help us figure out where we‚Äôre going before you summon something by accident.‚Äù

Casey lifted his flashlight, its beam landing on a spiral staircase at the far end of the room, half-swallowed by shadow. ‚ÄúUp there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs an old loft. Probably the safest place to sit and drink this sad excuse for beer.‚Äù

He patted the backpack slung over his shoulder, and Brooksie raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you even *get* beer?‚Äù

Casey grinned. ‚ÄúNico‚Äôs older brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù Nico objected.

We gathered near the base of the stairs, debating whether they‚Äôd hold our weight. Nico gave the first step an experimental bounce, then climbed three steps before turning back. ‚ÄúStable enough,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt all come up at once.‚Äù

One by one, we followed him, Wren‚Äôs hand brushing mine briefly as we ascended. They offered a faint smile, the kind they saved for when they were worried and wanted someone to worry with them so they didn‚Äôt feel alone.

The loft creaked ominously but held. A shattered window let in a shaft of moonlight, pale and cold. The group sat in a rough circle on crates, torn tarps, or the floor. Casey passed out warm cans of beer, and Nico launched into yet another urban legend. This time a staple of the area,¬† about some man who goes crazy when he finds his wife cheating on him and murders her and their children, But of course inside an abandoned Steel Mill¬† the story didn‚Äôt exactly feel casual.

It felt like waiting.

Like holding your breath before something breaks.

I leaned back against the wall, can untouched, my fingers brushing the floor where something sticky clung to the wood¬† rust maybe. The scent of burnt sweetness curled faintly into the air.

I stiffened.

The others didn‚Äôt seem to notice. But something shifted behind my eyes, a memory tugging at the edges of the present.

That smell again. Burnt sugar.

Wet iron.

And somewhere outside, just beyond the walls, I swore I heard it quiet, distant

**Laughter.**

Just for a second.

Then it was gone.

**Thunderstorms**

Wren looked up sharply. ‚ÄúDid anyone else hear that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Nico asked, halfway through some gory twist in his ghost story.

‚ÄúThat scraping sound.‚Äù And there it was¬† slow, deliberate, something dragging itself across concrete somewhere below us.

‚ÄúRats?‚Äù Nico offered, but even he sounded unsure.

‚ÄúNope,‚Äù Brooksie said, standing. ‚ÄúNope. No rats make *that* noise.‚Äù

We all went quiet.

The sound came again. Closer. Louder. Not skittering like claws scraping, like rusted nails across steel.

Then a thump. Heavy. Like something fell.

We all jumped.

Casey swung his flashlight toward the staircase, but it barely pierced the black. ‚ÄúYou guys heard that, right?‚Äù

Brooksie muttered, ‚ÄúI knew this was a stupid idea.‚Äù She looked at me angrily.¬†

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even say anything,‚Äù I shot back.

‚ÄúYeah, but you‚Äôve been weird all day. You knew something was off. And you still said yes.‚Äù

I felt heat rise to my cheeks. ‚ÄúOh, so now this is my fault?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, you and Casey came in here like it was a date night‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, *what?*‚Äù Casey said, cutting in.

Wren stepped between us. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs not do this now.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Brooksie said, pointing at me. ‚ÄúShe dragged us into this. She‚Äôs been off for weeks moping around, acting like she‚Äôs haunted or something. And now *this* place feels like it‚Äôs watching us and we‚Äôre just supposed to pretend it‚Äôs fine?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not fair,‚Äù Wren said quietly, but the damage was done.

Brooksie grabbed her bag. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm out. I don‚Äôt care if we have to hike through the woods. I‚Äôm not staying in here to get cursed or possessed or whatever this is.‚Äù

Nico stood too, clearly spooked. ‚ÄúYeah. I‚Äôm with her. I came for some spooky vibes, not a seance.‚Äù

Wren lingered, looking between me and casey. ‚ÄúDo you want me to stay?‚Äù

I almost said yes. But Casey hadn‚Äôt moved. His face was tight, unreadable, his flashlight beam frozen on the stairs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúJust... get them out safe?‚Äù

Wren nodded slowly, then disappeared down the stairs with the rest.

Suddenly, the silence was sharp.

Casey exhaled. ‚ÄúThat got intense.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck. ‚ÄúBrooksie‚Äôs always like that when she‚Äôs scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs not wrong though. That noise wasn‚Äôt nothing.‚Äù

We both went still.

Below us something moved. Not scraping this time. Footsteps. Measured. One step. Pause. Another.

Casey‚Äôs eyes locked on mine. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs someone down there.‚Äù

My blood went cold. ‚ÄúThen why are they not using a light?‚Äù

We both crouched low. Casey shut off his flashlight. The only light now came from the moon, stretched long across the floor like cold fingers.

The footsteps stopped. Right at the base of the stairs.

We waited.

And then

**tap**.	 **tap**.	 **Tap**.

Something began to climb.

Casey grabbed my hand.

I didn‚Äôt even realize I‚Äôd reached for him first.

‚ÄúLiza,‚Äù he whispered, breath warm against my ear, ‚Äúwe need to move.‚Äù

We backed toward the far side of the loft. No floorboards creaked beneath our feet, like the building wanted silence.

The tapping got louder.¬†

Closer.

We ducked behind an old workbench and dropped low.

I turned to him, my voice barely there. ‚ÄúWhatever this is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it wants the others.‚Äù

He looked at me. ‚ÄúYou think it wants *us*?‚Äù

And then something **laughed**.

Right at the top of the stairs.

A voice like static and syrup.

But when Casey stood up and shone his flashlight toward the sound

There was nothing there.

Just dust. Just silence. We ran.

Not down the stairs, not at first. Just away. Across the loft, away from that spot at the top of the staircase where the laughter had curled into the air like smoke.

Casey pulled me with him, flashlight bouncing in jerky arcs across the broken floor, throwing long shadows that moved when we didn‚Äôt. The beam stuttered over splintered wood, old crates, rusted machinery but nothing human. Nothing solid. Just that sound behind us.

Dragging. Scraping.¬†

Low and wrong and echoing from places it shouldn‚Äôt reach.

We hit the opposite edge of the loft, and Casey turned in a tight circle, scanning for another way down.

‚ÄúLadder!‚Äù he hissed, pointing to a rusted fire escape ladder bolted crookedly against the far wall. Half the rungs looked ready to give under a sneeze, but it was that or go back toward the stairs.

We didn‚Äôt hesitate.

I went first, my palms slick on the cold metal, heart pounding so loud I thought it might give us away.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look back,‚Äù Casey murmured above me. ‚ÄúJust go.‚Äù

A sound split the air sharp, high-pitched, like metal tearing in half. Screeching.

My foot slipped on a rung slick with rain, but Casey caught me before I fell.

We hit the ground behind the mill and didn‚Äôt stop running.

The woods loomed dark and close, branches clawing at our arms, brambles catching on our jeans. We crashed through them, blind and breathless. Somewhere in the distance, thunder growled, and the sky cracked open.

Rain began to fall in cold sheets.

I didn‚Äôt look behind us. I couldn‚Äôt. Every instinct in me screamed not to turn around, not to give it shape by seeing it. But I felt it. In my bones. Breathing down our necks. Smiling**.**

We hit the clearing by the old drainage pipe and turned hard. Mud sucked at my shoes, my jacket plastered to my skin. The rain turned everything to black glass, every tree a silhouette twisted wrong. Casey‚Äôs hand was still gripping mine like a lifeline.

The truck was just ahead.

A bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the hill and for a split second, in the space between thunder and breath, I saw it.

Standing just beyond the treeline.

Tall.¬†

Too tall.

Head tilted. Limbs too long. Like a man whose skin didn‚Äôt quite fit.Then darkness swallowed it again.

Casey unlocked the truck with shaking hands and we dove inside, slamming the doors, locking them immediately. The moment the truck was sealed up, the rain turned violent sheets of it crashing onto the windshield, thunder rattling the frame.

We sat there, panting, soaked, staring out into the woods like it might crawl into the cab next.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Did you see‚Äù Casey started.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt,‚Äù I cut him off, voice cracking.¬†

He swallowed, nodded once.

The interior lights flickered. My breath fogged the window.

‚ÄúWhere are the others?‚Äù I asked suddenly.

Casey‚Äôs eyes went wide. He leaned forward, scanning the lot, the road, the trees. ‚ÄúThey were supposed to head back,‚Äù he said, voice too tight, too quiet. But there was nothing. No shapes in the dark. No flashlights. No footsteps in the mud outside the truck but ours. The world outside was just rain and trees and shadows that didn‚Äôt move right. I felt a sharp jolt of panic seize my chest. ‚ÄúCasey,‚Äù I said, voice barely audible over the downpour, ‚ÄúWhere the hell are they?‚Äù

The truck was still parked at the edge of the lot, headlights off, rain blurring everything outside into watercolors. The only light came from the dashboard‚Äôs faint glow and Casey‚Äôs phone screen, which he kept checking every few seconds like maybe someone would materialize just by him staring hard enough. I‚Äôd peeled off my jacket and draped it over my lap, water soaking into the seat beneath me. My fingers were numb. My teeth wouldn‚Äôt stop chattering. They were *gone*. The others. Brooksie, Wren, Nico. No lights, no shouting our names, no tracks in the mud. Just the woods. Just that thing.

Just us.

I pressed the heels of my palms into my eyes and tried to breathe. One. Two. Three. Don‚Äôt think about it. Don‚Äôt,

Casey‚Äôs phone buzzed.

He jumped like someone had slammed the hood, then turned the screen toward himself.

And froze.

‚Äú‚Ä¶What?‚Äù I asked, my voice hoarse.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, uh. It‚Äôs Wren.‚Äù

I leaned in as he read out loud:

**Wren:** hey. you two good? **Wren:** we made it home like 20 min ago. **Wren:** didn‚Äôt see you leave. was kinda worried.

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúTwenty‚Ä¶ twenty *minutes* ago?‚Äù

Casey looked at the clock on the dash. 1:41 a.m.

We‚Äôd only left the mill *maybe* fifteen minutes ago. Maybe. ‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt make sense,‚Äù he muttered, thumbs already tapping out a response.

**Casey:** wait what?? we just got to the truck. storm‚Äôs insane. thought you were still inside.

The reply came fast.

**Wren:** what? **Wren:** we left before it even started raining. Nico said you two were right behind us.

Casey and I looked at each other, the same sick understanding blooming between us.

They‚Äôd left *before* the rain started.

But it had been pouring‚Äî*slamming*‚Äîby the time we even hit the woods. The downpour had chased us the whole way.

Casey stared at the screen, then typed something else.

**Casey:** When did you leave exactly?

A few seconds passed. Another buzz.

**Wren:** idk exactly. like 1?? maybe a little before **Wren:** definitely before the rain started. **Wren:** why?

I swallowed hard.

**One.**

We were *still in the loft* at one. I‚Äôd seen it on my phone right before we heard the knocking.

And then we heard it again.

And again.

Casey dropped his phone into the center console like it had burned him. Rain hammered the roof above us, steady and unrelenting.

I didn‚Äôt speak.

I couldn‚Äôt.

Because something about this felt wrong.

Like the forest had changed the rules. Bent time. Bent *us*.

My phone buzzed in my pocket.

**Brooksie:** u alive or what **Brooksie:** Nico says he saw something in the rearview **Brooksie:** said it was tall af. hope it wasn‚Äôt you lol

I stared at it.

Read it again.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Casey?‚Äù I said, barely more than a whisper.

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we should leave. *Now.*‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt argue. Just turned the key, the engine rumbling back to life. The headlights cut through the rain, casting long, spidery shadows through the trees.

And as we pulled onto the road, I checked the rearview mirror.

Nothing followed us.

But I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that it had *let* us go.

For now.

The truck‚Äôs heater kicked in about five minutes after we hit the road, and I started to feel my toes again. My jeans squished every time I shifted, and the seatbelt strap was sticking to my damp neck.

Casey kept looking at the road like it had personally betrayed him.

We‚Äôd barely spoken since pulling away from the mill, except for a few grunts and one dramatic ‚ÄúJesus Christ‚Äù when a raccoon darted across the road and nearly gave us both matching heart attacks.

Eventually, I couldn‚Äôt take the silence anymore.

‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I said, teeth still chattering a little. ‚ÄúOn a scale of one to existential crisis, how dead do you think we should be right now?‚Äù

He let out a short, unsteady laugh. ‚ÄúNegative three. Like we entered a different plane of reality and shouldn‚Äôt *exist* anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúCool,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúSame page.‚Äù

Another beat of silence. Then:

‚ÄúDo you think this counts as a first date?‚Äù he asked, completely straight-faced.

I blinked at him. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean‚Äù He gestured vaguely at the soaked truck, the empty road, his own shirt still clinging to him like a sad dishrag. ‚ÄúCreepy building, shared trauma, adrenaline. You literally grabbed my hand while we were being chased by... I dunno. Tim Burton‚Äôs wet dream ,He paused, I‚Äôm just saying, you climbed out your window and risked death for me. That‚Äôs at least coffee-worthy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said we were going ghost hunting,‚Äù I deadpanned. ‚ÄúWe found actual ghosts. You *owe* me coffee.‚Äù

He let out a loud, relieved laugh. It echoed in the cab like it didn‚Äôt know whether to be joy or hysteria.

I laughed too‚Äîbig and sudden‚Äîuntil I was doubled over, wiping tears from my face.

‚ÄúThis is the dumbest night of my life,‚Äù I gasped.

‚ÄúWorse than homecoming sophomore year?‚Äù

‚ÄúI broke my heel and got gum in my hair this *wins* by a landslide.‚Äù

Casey reached over, still smiling, and nudged my arm gently. ‚ÄúHey. Seriously, though... thanks for not freaking out on me.‚Äù

I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI *did* freak out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, but like. In a manageable, *deeply* charming way.‚Äù

I turned toward him, still smiling. He looked back at me for half a second too long before snapping his eyes back to the road, suddenly sheepish.

‚ÄúYou are, uh...‚Äù He cleared his throat. ‚ÄúA lot braver than you think.‚Äù

My smile faded to something softer. My heart did a weird somersault I blamed entirely on adrenaline.

‚ÄúSame to you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEven if your ‚Äòbravery‚Äô looks suspiciously like poor decision-making.‚Äù

‚ÄúI contain multitudes.‚Äù

We were quiet for a few more seconds. The rain was starting to let up. Steam fogged the windows, and the world outside looked sleepy and unfamiliar.

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù I said eventually, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre either trauma bonded or this is the beginning of a really weird love story.‚Äù

Casey grinned. ‚ÄúWhy not both?‚Äù I rolled my eyes, but it didn‚Äôt stop the warmth from creeping into my chest.¬†

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I stuttered out. ‚ÄúCan we just park the truck somewhere, I don‚Äôt think I can be alone yet.‚Äù I stutter the words out nervously. He eyes me cautiously before turning the opposite direction of my house. ‚ÄúCasey please tell me you didn‚Äôt take that to mean I wanted to go to the old cemetery right now?‚Äù I mutter in disbelief.

‚ÄúActually we are going to the cemetery and I am a genius because even the cops don't want to go over that direction this late at night.‚Äù He says confidently as he slows down to drive on the twisty dirt road leading toward the gray pillar gravestones. I put my hands on my face, beginning to regret having said anything at all as he parks the truck and looks over at me expectantly.¬†

‚ÄúYou know,‚Äù he leans his head in my general direction, ‚Äúfor someone who isn't usually much of a risk taker you've sure had one hell of a night.‚Äù A soft breathy laugh escapes before I can make any effort to hold it in. He sees this as some kind of opportunity to reach forward and move a lock of my hair behind my ear. My eyes open wide, like a deer caught in a semi-trucks headlights.¬†

‚ÄúCasey, I really hope you‚Äôre not trying to do what I think you‚Äôre trying to do because this is a piss-poor time to do it.‚Äù He smirked an unforgettable smirk, an ‚ÄúI‚Äôll remember this for 20 years‚Äù smirk. Of course he did.¬†

‚ÄúThen when should I do it Liz?‚Äù The question is rhetorical. He leans in and kisses me regardless.¬†

His lips were warmer than I expected, soft, hesitant at first, like he was giving me a chance to pull away. I didn‚Äôt. Maybe I should‚Äôve. Maybe five hours ago I would‚Äôve. But now?

Now I was in a fogged-up truck, parked in a haunted cemetery, soaked to the bone, having barely outrun something I couldn‚Äôt explain and Casey¬† was kissing me like it was the one thing in the world that still made sense.

My hands moved without thinking, one curling into the fabric of his hoodie, the other finding the side of his neck, damp skin and too-fast pulse under my palm. He leaned in harder at that, shifting closer until the gearshift jabbed him in the hip and made both of us laugh against each other‚Äôs mouths.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really bad at logistics,‚Äù I murmured, breathless, forehead pressed to his.

‚ÄúI never claimed to be good at logistics,‚Äù he muttered, already leaning back in.

This time it wasn‚Äôt hesitant. His mouth was insistent, hungry not desperate exactly, but like we‚Äôd both been teetering on a ledge for too long and finally decided to jump. His hand came up to cup my cheek, thumb brushing just beneath my eye, grounding and gentle in a way that made my stomach flip.

I pulled him closer, not even thinking, knees bending under me so I could shift half into his lap. The truck‚Äôs cab was suddenly too small, the air too warm, my heart way too loud.

His hands found my waist, tentative like he was still asking permission even now. That made something in my chest go soft, sore in the best possible way.

We broke apart for air, just barely, our faces still close enough that I could feel his breath against my lips.

He grinned, all teeth, all trouble. ‚Äú I stand by that being a first date.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insufferable,‚Äù I whispered.

‚ÄúAnd yet,‚Äù he murmured, pressing another kiss to the corner of my mouth, ‚Äúhere you are.‚Äù

I could‚Äôve kissed him again. I wanted to. But then something in the shadows shifted, probably just wind, or maybe the groan of an old oak tree and both of us flinched like idiots.

We stared at the foggy window for a beat, hearts still racing.

Then Casey whispered, ‚ÄúOkay, that‚Äôs enough horny-in-a-haunted-graveyard for one night.‚Äù

I snorted, flopping back into my seat. ‚ÄúPlease tell me you‚Äôre putting that on my tombstone when this all eventually kills us.‚Äù

1kf0uiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1kf0uiw/getting_over_ex_who_reached_out_but_is_in_long/,"Getting over ex who reached out, but is in long term relationship","TLDR: My ex(24m) from 3 years ago reached out to let me(23f) know he has been dating someone for 2 years. He also invited me to join his relationship, but I didn‚Äôt want to be in a poly situation. What kills me is I have missed him a lot, and wanted to see him, but not like this. It feels like all of the baggage from the past is being drudged up.

This is a vent, and an attempt to process my emotions over this situation, and I appreciate anyone who reads this or offers any support or advice.

3ish years ago, I got out of a long term relationship with a really toxic ex and very soon after met someone new. We never officially dated because I was so fresh out of a relationship that had traumatized me that I didn‚Äôt want to dive into anything serious, but wanted to meet new people. I was very clear from the beginning that I didn‚Äôt want a relationship, but we got along very well. We also had similar sexual desires, and had very good sexual chemistry. It was a big part of our relationship. We saw each other for about 5 months, and during that time we went on vacations together, and he was overall a very supportive, kind, and good partner. At the time, the only reason I wouldn‚Äôt date him was because I had just gotten out of my other relationship and was scared to officially date someone new. He wanted a serious relationship, and after 5 months decided to leave because I couldn‚Äôt give him what he needed. I understood totally why he needed to leave, and thought it was for the best that we stop seeing each other because I didn‚Äôt want to hurt him anymore. I was definitely sad about us breaking it off, but I didn‚Äôt cry about it. 

Fast forward a year later. I reached out to him on my way to Spain to tell him it reminded me of a trip we took together, and how fond my memories of it were, and how I hoped he was doing well. It led us to talk for about a month, and it felt like old times. I was excited at the prospect of potentially rekindling our relationship, and I was at a point where I was ready to actually date. However I was studying abroad and wouldn‚Äôt be back for 8 weeks. Then one day we had a minor argument about something trivial, and he never responded. And I have my own issues, so I didn‚Äôt message him back either since he didn‚Äôt respond to me. I was definitely sad that we wouldn‚Äôt see each other when I got home, but again, I didn‚Äôt cry about it, and I moved on with my life. 

Fast forward again 2 years. About a month ago, I get a text from him. It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúhey how are you‚Äù text, it was a reply to his own message from 2 years ago about a coworker he mentioned that he was getting along with, letting me know that they have been dating these last two years. Of course my immediate thought was, ‚Äúwow are you trying to rub it in my face?‚Äù Which is probably being unfair, but thats how I felt. I didn‚Äôt say anything negative though, I just responded positively and asked him how he was. We texted a bit to catch each other up about our lives, and I thought that was going to be it. But he kept messaging me. Then he asked if we could call on the phone, which I thought was a little strange, and thought might be a serious conversation. But we just talked on the phone like normal for an hour. At this point I was starting to feel uncomfortable with how often he was texting because he‚Äôs in a relationship, so I let him know that I don‚Äôt want to cause any problems for his relationship. Then he tells me, his girlfriend is okay with him talking to other women and seeing other women. I don‚Äôt take the bait, and still keep things platonic. 

My issue with talking with him at this point has been that every time he mentions his girlfriend, or what they‚Äôre doing, I get this intense feeling of envy or jealously. I will really enjoy talking to him, and then he mentions his partner, and I have to stop myself from being like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care‚Äù. And I don‚Äôt want to feel this way, I am sure his girlfriend is a great person, and I have no personal problems with her. He asked to call again, which we do, and it is pleasant, and he asks if I want to meet for coffee. At first I say yes, because I do really want to see him. But then I start thinking about how all of this communication has really thrown me for a loop emotionally. Its starting to feel uncomfortable with how upset I am getting about his new relationship. So I text him telling him. That I‚Äôm sorry, but I don‚Äôt think its a good idea for me to see him. And he says he understands. And I thought that would be the end of it.

A week later, this man texts me asking if ‚Äúim doing okay‚Äù. Which at first kind of pissed me off, because I was doing okay until you messaged me, but again I might be being unfair here, if he is actually concerned about how I am doing. He asks if I want to cut contact completely. And I don‚Äôt want to cut contact completely, but I also don‚Äôt think we need to be messaging everyday. And that‚Äôs what I told him. I asked if he‚Äôs just looking for friendship. And he says ‚Äúyes‚Äù. And I tell him, since our previous relationship was so defined by sex, I can‚Äôt really separate those two, so platonic friends isn‚Äôt something I see working. And then he suggests the potential of me joining his relationship. Which on the one hand I was actually kind of interested in, because again, I miss him a lot. I have been wanting to see him. I thought him reaching out again was to maybe rekindle something. But the reality is, I will not be able to function well in a poly relationship. I have worked really hard to understand myself and my emotions, and I‚Äôm already having intense reactions to just hearing about his partner, I don‚Äôt need that to be my constant state. I told him the next day that I didn‚Äôt think it was going to work out, and basically wished him good luck. He then tried asking me for a threesome with his gf, and also suggesting we only see each other. And at this point emotionally, I am devastated. It‚Äôs so painful that he is trying to reach out to me, and see me, which I have wanted him to do, but his current situation makes me so sad. Like I have wanted to see him again romantically, but not like this. 

I have been so upset these last few days having to reject his advances, because I know it‚Äôs the right thing for me, but it still hurts so much. I have been crying about it, and now it feels like every little thing is reminding me of him and all the wonderful times we had together in the past. Part of me feels like he‚Äôs the one that got away, but I could be being dramatic. It just hurts thinking that if he had first met me when I was not fresh out of my last relationship, that it would be us that had been together for 2 years. It is also weird for me because the first two times we stopped talking I was not this devastated about it. I think it may have something to do with me smoking weed a lot during those times, and now I have stopped. So maybe part of my emotions are feeling everything I felt for him in the past all at once, but damn it hurts so bad. 

I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs going to keep messaging me anymore, but what I wish I could say to him is that if he is ever single again, to reach out to me. Not that I am waiting for him, but if I am single, I would want a chance to be together. I don‚Äôt want to tell him that though, because I don‚Äôt want to be planting any seeds in his mind that might hurt his current relationship, because they seem to be really happy together, and I don‚Äôt want whatever relationship we do have to be because of me creating problems. 

If you got this far, thank you for reading. I feel better just typing this all out. Again, I appreciate any comments of support, advice, or your own opinions.‚ù§Ô∏è
