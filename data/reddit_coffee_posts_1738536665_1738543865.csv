Being a mob boss was something you didn‚Äôt want to do. With how you got roped into becoming a mob boss, it was a family business. Your mom and dad ran one of the biggest mobs in the world. Officials were paid off so your family was untouchable. Or so they thought. You wanted to get your MBA and be a businesswoman to help others. You had a boyfriend that you were going to marry and have a family with. But, that all changed as you, your parents, and boyfriend went out to dinner together. All of a sudden, there was a shootout against a rival gang. Your parents were shot and your boyfriend tried to stick up to you, but he ended up getting shot too. They left you alive to be forced to endure that trauma. You had to go through therapy and still had nightmares and terrors. After cohesion from the gang‚Äôs higher ups, you decided to take control of the gang. You went from being the sweet, bubbly, person that you were to being cold hearted, fueled with revenge, and straight to business. You found the rival gang and pretty much ended them. Instead of pursuing your dream of creating a business, you decided to allow your family‚Äôs mob business to continue. People feared you and that if anyone dared to look at you the wrong way, they would endure your wrath. You were in need of an assistant. Someone to get you coffee, book your trips, represent you in meetings. I was one of the few applicants. However, you did not interview me, you had your people interview me.

The battery died and they were trying to move it into a parking space that was on the other end (the only available spot and their friend was holding it down so they could get their car out of the way.) I dropped my bag into their car and told them to get in the drivers seat so they could steer and I went to the back of the car to start pushing. I ended up pushing that car into the parking space about two thousand feet away up an incline in the parking lot. Something I would have never been able to do a year ago.

Folks, he is making an entire deductive code book using ChatGPT. I asked him if he mentions this in methodology in his proposal. I read his methodology section of his proposal. No mention of how the deductive code book was developed using this particularly novel ‚Äúiterative‚Äù process.

We have a whole discussion on citing AI. I show him resources. He needs to do this because he‚Äôs having the machine craft entire paragraphs of his proposal- make it sound better.
Move this here, make this argument there. Good discussion. End of coffee date. We leave.

A day or so later, he tells me he‚Äôs submitted his proposal to his supervisor. I asked if he added a line about how he used ChatGPT to develop his code book. 

Nope. Not a line. Said it required 1-2 paragraphs. Fair; but it‚Äôs the proposal. He could‚Äôve just added a single line and prepared for an oral defense and expanded for the dissertation.

I'm wondering if there's a way of doing this that involves less cleaning up afterwards? I really enjoy matcha lattes and prefer how they make me feel to coffee so I'd really like an easy way to incorporate them into my life more. Many thanks üòÅ",1,1738542571.0,Matcha,1,0.6,False

Think for a second about hyper or highly palatable foods and cigarettes by themselves; without chemicals, are they even as nearly satisfying?

You are valuable, and I can prove it. You're all probably very good, very nice people and your worth is not tied to whether Dean Ingber liked you or if Dean Andy thought you smelled bad.  As a matter of fact- they need you. Not only for their tuition, but for their alumni network, and for their bragging purposes.

AND you are at your most valuable now!  Schools will not give you a scholarship if you transfer after your 1L year.  It doesn't matter if you're coming from Harvard or Villanova.  They have lost out on your juicy juicy stats. They usually won't save your scholarship if you decide to defer.  They want what you've got and they want it now!

My point is that you are valuable whether you like it or not, to some school- somewhere.  You may think it's some podunk backwater school but I'm sure they're not waking up going- hey GRWM as I go to teach at my shitty law school. Most law schools have excellent faculty who went to really good schools.  Remember how hard it is to get into legal academia!? 

Also! It's law school people, it's doctrinal, it's not studio art. The law is the law. You're learning the same ones at New England School of Law or whatever its called as the boys and girls at HAhvard yahd. 



RANKINGS CHANGE:

I have a relative who went to a school that was ranked in the T30 in the 90's and now sits in the 100's. Conversely, TAMU jumped 100+ spots in a year.  Johnnie Cochran went to Loyola Marymount.  You're allowed to be successful outside of the T-14. 

  
Think about why you really want to go to X law school... it is because you LOVE their environmental law program? Or is it because everyone else would like to go there?  The reason it is hard to get into certain schools is because they're not exactly original. You're special in your own way but you're not a special snowflake who ""deserves"" anything.  


It's a hard, shitty, tough cycle.  I know.  Your worth is not decided by 200 some odd Deans, and they will tell you the same thing.  If you get into a law school- Amazing.  There are a bajillion people I could introduce you to who would not be able to.  If you don't- Amazing. Lawyers hate their lives. Open up a coffee shop. Build community. It's not the only thing... not by a mile.

‚ÄúThis is insane!‚Äù Rose exclaimed, pouring a vanilla latte as fast as she could.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre telling me! Yesterday was nothing compared to this. Is the line getting bigger?‚Äù Bob shouted, slapping another BLT onto a plate.

‚ÄúYes, it has!‚Äù Rick said, running the next order out.

‚ÄúShut up and work!‚Äù Chief Richard said while taking another order.

The Orc Caf√© was the morning‚Äôs hot spot; everyone craved breakfast. The Orcs hadn‚Äôt planned on being so popular. Bob was sure he‚Äôd set a new counting record if only he could remember where he left off.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen an Orc cook this fast since the old Chief was late for dinner after the battle of Ant-anox-ore-a Pass,‚Äù Battleax chuckled, ‚ÄúYou pups are mighty busy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSure are, Battleax,‚Äù Richard said as he took a customer‚Äôs money, ‚ÄúSay, you need breakfast?‚Äù

‚ÄúI could eat,‚Äù Battleax said, getting out some coins.

‚ÄúExcuse me,‚Äù A man said, ‚ÄúWe're next.‚Äù

Battleax gave the man a stern look, and the woman beside him slapped him in the back of his head. ‚ÄúShhh, that‚Äôs the Legendary Battleax Battleax from the Region of Battleax, you idiot. Let him order.‚Äù

The man looked at his companion and then back to Battleax, ‚ÄúSorry, uh, you‚Äôre next.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù Battleax said with a big grin.

‚ÄúUh, I‚Äôll have a BLT and uh, coffee, you know, black, with uh, extra black, yeah,‚Äù Battleax said, nodding like it was an important decision.

‚ÄúHow about a vanilla latte instead?‚Äù Rose teased.

‚ÄúWell, uh,‚Äù Battleax looked at the line and saw many smiling faces, ‚ÄúWell, if you‚Äôre offering, it‚Äôd be rude to say no,‚Äù Battleax replied, trying to sound serious.

‚ÄúBLT and a Vanilla Latte for Battleax,‚Äù Richard shouted. Battleax stuck his tongue out through the gap in his front teeth.

Rick passed Battleax his food and drink. The old barbarian grinned and gave a nod. He attempted to give coins to Richard, but Richard waved him away.

""You're keeping the town safe, and you're family,"" Chief Richard said.

‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Battleax flashed a toothy grin. ‚ÄúIf you can, stop by the tavern later. I‚Äôll be telling the story of my people.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there!‚Äù Rose shouted.

‚ÄúThankfully, Bob talked me into having Doug, the twins, and George cover later,‚Äù Richard said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to need a break.‚Äù

‚Äî Rose, Rick, Bob, and Richard handed off the still-busy Orc Cafe booth to the new crew. It was lunchtime, and they had switched to hot dogs and fries.¬† The group made their way to the tavern, where they found a small stage with long rows of seats set up. Sitting in the back was Thorn.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Rose said, sliding into the seat beside Thorn. ‚ÄúHere for the story?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here to hear an old fool ramble,‚Äù Thorn grumbled.

A small figure climbed onto the raised platform. She was clad in all purple with her unique purple hat. The Orcs recognized her as the woman who‚Äôd opened the ceremony.

‚ÄúGentlefolk,‚Äù She said, raising her hands for silence, ‚Äútoday we will be blessed to hear the story of the barbarians told by a legendary barbarian, Battleax.‚Äù

With the introduction, Battleax walked out of the tavern; he was still wearing his apron and had a hair net attempting to contain his wild hair.¬† He gave his signature gapped-tooth smile and sat down on the chair on the stage. A large crowd had gathered. It was rare for the old Barbarian to want to tell the tale of the origin of the barbarians. Lately, nostalgia had crept in with age, and today felt like the right day to tell the story. Everyone had an origin story: the dwarves, the elves, the orcs, even the imps. Humans, everyone knew, had fallen from the sky. But the barbarians... the barbarians were more than just human; they, well, they were barbarians.

Battleax raised his arms high to silence the crowd and began his story. ""Listen up, everyone. Listen to how we, my people, came to be. A group of humans had started to explore the mountains of my homeland. They were mountaineer tribes that wandered the mountains, surviving off berries, nuts, and wild game. But they are not part of my story. They were the ones who abandoned the woman who would birth all barbarians. Her name was Barbara.""

""Barbara was part of the group exploring the mountains, but she was small and weak compared to the others. They felt she held them back when the snow came, so they abandoned her in a cave. They told her that she would stay and die. But she found freshwater, berries, nuts, and small game and thrived in that cave system. She used it to protect herself from larger wildlife. Even though she was smaller than the other mountaineers, she learned the ways of the mountain. No one knows what happened to those who abandoned her; history itself abandoned them.""

‚Äî

One day, outside Barbra‚Äôs cave, there was a strange noise; she peeked out to investigate, knowing that some wild animals would occasionally wander near. She used fire and traps to scare them off. What she found that day was not a wild animal but a giant, or rather, a small giant. He was small for a giant, standing only 7 feet tall, though fully grown. At first, she was afraid, thinking she might be under attack. But he sat by the cave, softly crying.

Barbra knew what it was like to be alone and scared, so she slowly ventured out of her cave. ""Why are you crying?"" she asked.

The boy was startled. He looked at her, surprised that anyone would be there. ""I‚Äôm sorry,"" he said. ""My family exiled me.""

""Why?"" Barbra asked, but deep down, she knew.

""I'm too small. I am not tall, strong, or stout like my brothers and father. I cannot wage war. I‚Äôm too little for war. Even the orcs are about the same height as me. So they sent me to the mountains to die."" The not-so-giant giant said.

Barbara sat beside him, ""I'm Barbra, what's your name?""

""They call me Tiny. I am a tiny giant,"" he said.

Barbra and Tiny became fast friends. Barbara showed him which berries were poisonous and which were safe. He taught her how to make better weapons to hunt with. Together, they created a home for themselves in the cave, keeping watch over the mountains.

Tiny and Barbara soon met more runts and outcasts from other tribes. Slowly, they grew a found family. Many of these outcasts brought skills valuable to their new community: farming, metalwork, medicine, and knowledge. They began to thrive as a community.

Years later, Barbara and Tiny were blessed with twins, a male and a female. The female was named Barbara after her mother. Tiny refused to name the boy after himself, so they called him Barbarian, the first of his kind.

They made the mountains their home and created their families. Soon, many more were born. They refused to honor those who abandoned them, so they named their children after the weapons that defended their home: the battle axes, the spears, the shields, the daggers. All of them were descendants of Barbara, Tiny, and their twins.



""Now, my people are barbarians. We look to the mountains far to the west, knowing those roads take us home. After our time here is done, we know that we return to our people in those mountains."" Battleax stood up with pride.

The crowd applauded the old Barbarian. He blushed and took a bow. The purple-clad storyteller applauded.¬† She bowed her head to Battleax.

The storyteller turned to the audience and said, ‚ÄúThe Barbarians are a proud, stout race. Few can stand against them.‚Äù¬†

Thorn huffed at the comment, but Rose nudged her gently.

Battleax waved and returned to the inn. The Orcs and Imp gathered together.

‚ÄúWell, we have a break for a bit.‚Äù Bob said, ‚ÄúI want to go check out the rest of the festive.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you,‚Äù Richard said.

‚ÄúThorn, do you want to go with me and Rick?‚Äù Rose asked. ‚ÄúWe are going to check out some of the other booths.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Thorn said, ‚ÄúI got business with someone.‚Äù She waved her hand to the others as she left them confused.

‚ÄúI wonder what business she has here?‚Äù Richard asked.

‚ÄúShamans. Always mysterious,‚Äù Bob muttered.

‚ÄúCareful, or I‚Äôll turn your gold into iron,‚Äù Rose teased.

Bob‚Äôs eyes grew large, ‚ÄúWhat, wait, can you do that?‚Äù

Rose laughed as she took Rick‚Äôs hand and wandered off into the festival.

tldr:¬† Absolutely worth the time and money for the Dessert 101 Course if you:

* Have made attempts at 8-10+ different homemade ice cream recipes so you know what success and failure looks like - (Cuisinart ICE or an old rock salt machine is perfectly fine or borrow something don‚Äôt buy anything big for this).
* Do some textbook reading beforehand so technical lectures won‚Äôt be over your head.
* Engage with the vendors and grab their contact info, even if still forming a concept.

Prior to Attending:

I have been fairly active in the kitchen for the last three years, first attending and later volunteering to assist as sous chef for classes at a local culinary center, covering cuisines all over the world - altogether about 500 hours of experience as an understudy for very experienced executive chefs in said commercial kitchen.¬† Additionally most every Saturday for the last two years I have challenged myself to create either dish completely foreign to me or something familiar using a new cooking technique.¬† This includes about a dozen reasonably successful ice creams starting from a French vanilla base, a couple of sub-par attempts at sorbet and gelato.¬† Everything I‚Äôve attempted I‚Äôve captured the recipes along with complete notes and alterations so I know what to do (and not do) next time.

I read chapters 1-4 and 7-9 of ‚ÄòIce Cream‚Äô, Goff, 7th edition, from a PDF online.¬† In retrospect chapters 5 and 10 would have  been helpful, but I ran out of time.¬† My reading helped me significantly because the class was not the first time I was seeing these words and hearing these concepts; they had been previously introduced to me and Dr. Roberts and others were able to put the textbook information in context of what I as a small batch processor would actually use in the United States at present.¬† I would consider those chapters required reading for anyone wanting to maximize their experience.

Registration and Travel:

Sign ups for the course opened up the morning of July 18th, 2024. I had checked the page \*at least\* every day since the first of June.¬† The 7-day course was already full so I immediately signed up for the Ice Cream 101 course.¬†

The Monday of the week of the event, I received an email with the agenda attached.

On Thursday I flew in from KC to Pittsburgh, got a rental car and did the 2.5 hr drive to State College, PA without incident, arriving about 3:30pm local time.¬† I stayed at the Hyatt off of Beaver Ave, but pretty much any hotel in the area is going to be within 10 minutes of the venue. There are also flight options to State College, PA itself (really!), Philadelphia, or Baltimore.¬† Get your hotel early, college events scheduled that weekend may cause rooms to fill up closer to the date and prices may skyrocket.

Event Experience:

Registration was Friday, 11am at the Penn Stater.¬† It‚Äôs handled like any small conference event in a hotel, signed in at the registration table, got my swag and box lunch (sandwich, cookie, chips, fruit, drink) and headed to the assigned conference room.¬† All class materials and slides, probably around 150 pages, are given out in a large 3-ring binder.

The room held 100 people, there were a little over 75 attendees on the contact info sheet with 7-8 staff members/presenters and 7-8 speakers and vendors in attendance.¬† Of those 75 people, 17 states were represented and several countries including Japan, China, Mexica, Singapore.¬† Most of the US attendees¬† were within 300 miles of PA.¬† Everyone gave a brief 45-60 second introduction, while there were some people that were new to ice cream making and there to learn, most either owned or had stated plans to own a restaurant, coffee shop, or ice cream shop and were looking to gain skills.¬† Several had been in business for quite a few years and were looking to hone their skills in the interest of continuing education.¬† There were a few dairy farm owners that were seeking to make the jump to ice cream manufacture.

The first day‚Äôs reception event was reasonably well attended, I met a few contacts and am glad I stayed. ¬† Also, there were three ice creams available to sample - Peachy Paterno, Raspberry Torte, Death by Chocolate.¬† I didn‚Äôt have any official Berkey Creamery after that, but had about 10-14 other flavor samples during labs, not counting the 10-12 vanilla and chocolate samples in the tasting lab.

Course Content:

(not including lunch/breaks)

First day was 5 hrs of lecture.¬†

Second day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.

Third day contained 4.5 hrs of lecture, 3 hours of lab.¬†

For labs, the class was split up into three groups of approximately¬† 25 people each.

Session topics included: Ice Cream Overview, Composition, Ice Cream Operation, Ingredients, Fresh Fruit, Mix Processing, Make Your Own Mix?, Flavors and Inclusions, Self Serve and Fresh Serve, Gelato, Entrepreneurial Topic, Freezing and Hardening, Post Freezing and Customer Engagement, Non-Dairy Desserts, Equipment Choices, Choosing Mix Suppliers, and Food Regulations.

Lab Exercises/Demonstration topics included: Soft Serve/Direct Draw machine maintenance and use, alcohol freezing, handheld treats, and Batch Freezers types and use with ice creams, gelatos and custards, ice cream formulations (taste testing 10-11 different samples and judging respective quality, defects, etc.)

I am sure the above is subject to change based on need and speaker availability.¬† Class flow was excellent and modules built on each other with little to no overlap on topics.¬† Dr. Roberts ran a tight ship, this entire event was on time to the minute.¬† Class attendees asked great questions, no one got off topic or meandered into any side discussions.¬†

Personal Notes:

I'm glad I did the 101 course, it was stated during the sessions that the primary difference between the 101 and the 7-day short course was days of additional content (and presumably labs) on each individual ingredient and mix formulation.¬† While the labs would have been fun, the lecture would have not been useful to me as someone not employed by a large-scale manufacturer.

I was not at the point where I had a defined concept and business plan, so I was not quite ready to establish formal relationships with vendors and suppliers.¬† But I took down everyone‚Äôs information, am sending thank you emails now and will follow up when my plans have ‚Äòhardened,‚Äô pun intended.¬†

However, this course did accomplish all of my personal goals: I will be digging deeper into the regulations around starting my own small business, reaching out to local commissaries to inquire about capabilities in hosting me as a startup, getting my own at-home blast freezer, developing relationships with my restaurant contacts to get placement in their venues, and putting together an ice cream class that I myself will teach where I‚Äôve previously been volunteering.  So very successful all around.

Hope the above write-up was helpful; best of luck to future classes and attendees.",10,1738541689.0,icecreamery,0,1.0,False

I Just Need A Bigger Role.","Alright, I (26F) am not sure if this is the right place to post, but I need opinions on something that kind of relates to the show.

Like in the slightest possible way but still

I‚Äôm an ER nurse, and I was absolutely lied to in nursing school.

They told me, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nothing like those medical dramas! It‚Äôs all hard work, no drama, no doctors and nurses dating, no wild storylines.‚Äù And sure, we‚Äôre not sneaking off to supply closets for steamy hookups (at least not in my hospital, I can‚Äôt speak for other hospitals ), but let me tell you, hospital drama is very real.

But People are dating. Doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff are constantly getting together, breaking up, and stirring up all kinds of chaos. Relationship drama?, Cheating allegations? Trust me Gossip spreads faster here than norovirus at a potluck.

Up until now, I‚Äôve been more of a background character, the nameless nurse who pops in, says a few lines, and disappears into the chaos. But I think if I have to be apart of this I should at least have a bigger role. 

And what better way than playing matchmaker for our resident will they won‚Äôt they couple?

Now, hear me out. This plan is a little crazy, but honestly, that‚Äôs perfect. Medical drama storylines are crazy.

I work in a busy ER in a high crime city, so we get a lot of patients in police custody. One of the cops who regularly brings in suspects is Derek (28M). And let me tell you, this man looks like he walked straight off the set of Hot Cops The Series. Tall, muscular, disgustingly attractive, and worst of all? Genuinely nice.

Naturally, the first time I saw him, I flirted. Shamelessly. Because damn, a man in uniform.

Unfortunately for me, Derek is very much not into women (tragic), but he was super sweet about it. No big deal. I‚Äôve been rejected before, and I will absolutely be rejected again.

But here‚Äôs where things get interesting.

Over the past year, Derek has been showing up a lot more, usually with gang related cases, which have been a huge problem in our city. We see a lot of gunshot and stab wounds. And in that time, it has become painfully obvious that he is extremely into my coworker Miles (27M).

Miles is another ER nurse and the one who usually handles the paperwork when Derek brings in a suspect. Most cops rush through it and try to push the nurses around, but not Miles. He takes no shit. He makes them sign every last damn line before they leave.

Derek never gives him trouble. If anything, I think he just see it as fa excuses to stick around longer.

It‚Äôs embarrassing how obvious he is. He flirts. He lingers. He chats with Miles about absolutely nothing.

One time, he brought coffee for the entire night shift but handed it directly to Miles while the rest of us stood there like chopped liver.

And the best or worst part? Miles is completely oblivious.

Like, classic cheesy drama storyline oblivious.

Now, you might be thinking, ‚ÄúMaybe Miles just isn‚Äôt into him.‚Äù Nope. Not the case.

When Derek first started coming around, Miles joined our little nurse gossip group, raving about how hot he was. We actually referred to him as The Hot Cop until we learned his actual name.

Miles also isn‚Äôt afraid to turn people down. He‚Äôs an attractive guy, a little too nerdy for my taste, but still good looking nonetheless. He‚Äôs had multiple med students, interns, and others hit on him, and he‚Äôs shut them down immediately. If he wasn‚Äôt into Derek, he would have made it very clear.

No, this isn‚Äôt a case of disinterest. This is a case of sheer, dumb obliviousness.

And every good medical drama has a meddling friend who pushes the will they won‚Äôt they couple together, right? And I feel like that could be me.

Of course, I‚Äôd have to be subtle. I can‚Äôt be too obvious. I‚Äôd rather not get reported, written up, or you know, fired for meddling. Unlike on TV, you can‚Äôt just break all the rules and keep your job.

So, I need advice. On how to get them together with out being obvious. Because I am so ready to upgrade from Background Nurse Number Four",1,1738541033.0,greysanatomy,4,0.67,False

It was all salvage material ‚Äî I used

* leftover plywood from building a partition in a basement
* 1x2 common board from the hardware store leftover from a fence/rodent wire project
* an extra closet rod we had from gf changing her mind about a closet
* staples & company wood filler & beher stain & poly leftover from a mini entryway console table built last year
* minwax polycrylic spray for the slats leftover from butcher block desktop built a few years ago
* handles bought in a set of 12 for refinishing a bathroom cabinet set

In true ill-advised-and-making-it-harder-than-it-needs-to-be fashion, I didn't rent anything but used what I had at home: hand held rotary saw, handheld orbital sander (wow this took a long time), clamps, countersinks, impact driver, etc ‚Äî cut and glued the plywood in 1.5"" strips as pictured.

We had an ugly coffee table under the TV before and feels like an upgrade. To a certain extent I wish it wasn't so dark and featured the funky end grain more, but at the same time the high gloss and dark color make me appear to be far more talented than I really am to the untrained eye of our guests lol. It's flawed and weird and I like it :)

¬†
2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The Clarke family took a content making trip to the Ripley‚Äôs aquarium in Gatlinburg.¬† Katie readily admits that it‚Äôs been hard trying to find things to do (i.e. film) in this cold winter season.¬† Travis filmed while Katie pointed and said ‚Äúlook‚Äù, ‚Äúlook‚Äù, ‚Äúsee??‚Äù to her 2 babies.¬† Later, we see Hailey scribbling all over a paper that Katie says is a picture of Granny.¬† They take lunch to Granny Kelly Jo at the big house and Gil greets them at the door. Before they can get inside, they have to make it through the tons of junk piled up on the front porch, including a workout system.¬† The big house is a dang mess.¬† There is trash on the floor, the door frame appears to have been chewed/scratched up, cups and things sitting around everywhere, toys scattered and the big brown couch has stains everywhere.¬† Gil is just walking around through that mess and Kelly is piled up on the couch.¬† I guess Michael can only do so much.¬† Gil points out that Hailey left him out of her picture for Granny, but she did add in JebJud.¬† In their weekly vlog Travis offers an apology to their followers for NOT showing their kids enough and promises to move away from house content and back to filming his family.¬† You read that right‚Ä¶ this ‚Äúman‚Äù is apologizing for not exploiting his kids enough.¬† We see Katie and Travis struggling to choose the perfect white paint, and Carlin and Evan show up to make the decisions for them.¬† Travis also admits that it was a huge mistake to buy a white couch while having a dog and babies.¬† Katie snags a HomeGoods sponsorship and shows off her freshly painted very white walls and very neutral floor.¬† She will probably get in trouble with Travis for not having Hailey star in the ad.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Josie Balka is back on social media and she is all in.¬† The hair pool noodles have restocked and you just know Josie‚Äôs baby hairs are screaming in terror for what is to come.¬† She sneaks a like on Kelly‚Äôs birthday post to Lexi Webster and that hasn‚Äôt happened in years.¬† We see a picture of baby Miles with Kelton at what appears to be a construction site‚Ä¶ are they building their McMansion yet?¬† Josie shares a minivlog of her 5am wake up that is really an ad for a protein powder.¬† After her workout, we see Hazel floating about in the ever present polyester princess dress.¬† Josie seems thinner than ever.¬† Josie decides to give her followers a tour of her nightstand because she has so many questions about what is on it.¬† She links a $170 alarm clock, $400 hair vitamins, Rihanna‚Äôs Fenti lip mask, and a $1400 bed cooling system.¬† SO damn relatable.¬† Meanwhile, her followers have an iphone to wake up, Suave shampoo and conditioner, Chapstick and an oscillating fan.¬† This week, Josie does every single thing while in her hair roller.¬† She bakes sourdough cinnamon rolls for Lydia, and films several tutorials and GRWMs. Her how to video has about 87 steps for washing and curling hair and the commenters say they don‚Äôt have that kind of time.¬† Josie appears to have endless time, even though she also has 3 children.¬† She tells us that she and Kelton are working hard to perfect latte art.¬† Every picture she shows on IG appears to be either a fist or‚Ä¶ lady parts.¬† But she‚Äôll keep trying because what else could she possibly have to do?¬† She films herself getting ready to get a haircut and rips the tags off of a brand new pair of Levi‚Äôs.¬† She tags and links the jeans so I guess they are a new sponsor.¬† She happily tells us the size of the jeans‚Ä¶ they are size 000/xxs and feature a 24 inch waist.¬† They have a built in button system to cinch the waist, and of course she needs the very last button.¬† Like I said‚Ä¶ girlie is thin.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Alyssa Webster finally posted for Lexi‚Äôs birthday, after Kelly Jo stole her thunder.¬† It appears that Lexi‚Äôs birthday celebration involved a stop at her mom‚Äôs favorite coffee shop, a 20 dollar bill and a tiny little cake at her grandparent‚Äôs house.¬† At least she didn‚Äôt have to wait 5 months to celebrate this year.¬† Of course Lurch took her out on the yearly creepy daddy daughter date and it appears they went to the deserted park where Alyssa forced everyone to give her their most painful smile.¬† A random little girl appears in the pictures and Alyssa says her mom is a ‚Äúchildhood friend‚Äù‚Ä¶. Her name is Mary and I really believe she just happened to be at the park with her daughter and Alyssa convinced her to pose for a picture and have her face filtered off with the rest of them. Later in the week Alyssa reverts back to the new ‚ÄúClean‚Äù filter that leaves only nostrils and hair behind.¬† She sits in her car talking to her phone and tells us that she is patting herself on the back because she finally worked up the courage to take her heathen children to both a park and a bounce house.¬† She tries to keep a smile on her face as she fake laughs through a story about the chaos she and her 5 children caused at the bounce house.¬† I don‚Äôt understand why she makes these kids sound so awful, but maybe it‚Äôs because they never go anywhere and have no clue how to act in public?¬† Anyway, Rhett whined and cried and the others squirmed and called her name over and over and she came off like a desperate mom (her words) so the staff and other customers had to assist her.¬† She is saying all of this through a filter that gives her 2 holes in the middle of her face and fried wild hair and‚Ä¶ whew‚Ä¶ she is just a tragic figure.¬† Congratulations to the Webster kids for finally getting beyond the sidewalk.¬† Keep giving her hell!

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Whitney Bates is a one woman show these days.¬† Her sidekick Carlin seems to be nowhere in sight and Whitney has to handle everything at the boutique as Carlin becomes a (very) silent partner.¬† BSB has started featuring a Bible verse on Sunday and they are pushing the ‚Äúmodest fashion‚Äù hashtag while also selling shorter and shorter dresses.¬† They are also selling sweaters for $80 and $80 jeans.¬† How long until their average price point is $100?¬† This week they took their $40 sale online and show markdowns that are only $10 off the original prices on most items.¬† While she runs the boutique, she is also not slouching on influencing and has scored a Chick-fil-a sponsorship.¬† In the comments, someone asks her what her husband does.¬† She says he ‚Äúdoes real estate‚Äù, helps at the boutique and ‚Äúhas fun‚Äù filming his cooking show.¬† We see you Whitney.¬† We HEAR you.¬† After a Chick-fil-a lunch, there is a tagged Waffle House supper, and then Whitney shows off a bowl of ground beef, tortilla chips and shredded cheese and calls it taco salad.¬† Zach sows up to take the girls to their tumbling lesson and that earns him major praise from the wife.¬† Whitney also has a Joanna Gaines sponsorship this week and shows off the new Magnolia cookbook.¬† Meanwhile, she tells the same tales over and over for the same products‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the same old easy plant, and the same old picture of a scrape on the skin repair ad.¬† In this week‚Äôs Bates Kitchen, it‚Äôs an old show featuring that jerk Chef Tim teaching Zach how to cook a frozen steak.¬† This was filmed when Zach had a messed up thumb so if you want to watch him stick his dirty hand brace in all the food‚Ä¶ this one is for you.


¬†
6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The world‚Äôs most boring pregnancy rolls on over at the Trace Bates house.¬† Lydia sends Trace out for a late night McDonald‚Äôs Sprite that she is craving and films him walking back in the house, chunking it at her and walking off, rolling his eyes.¬† Trying to drum up excitement for their gender (non)reveal, Lydia films a reel about old wives tales.¬† She says 8 of them fit a girl, and 3 fit a boy.¬† Then she takes Ryker to the mall to walk around and waste time.¬† The baby is dressed in all white.¬† Wonder how much she spends a month on Spray and Wash?¬† Commenters on her reel keep saying that they already know the baby‚Äôs gender because Trace said it in the Clark‚Äôs video‚Ä¶and Trace loses sleep staying up to delete every comment.¬† JebJud gets dropped off at the tiny house for a birthday sleep over.¬† I think this is the youngest JebJud and he shares a birthday with Trace.¬† The weekly vlog goes back in time almost 2 months to show their gender reveal.¬† First up though‚Ä¶ Trace reveals why Kelly is in a wrist cast.¬† She tells us that Duke the dog was staying with them‚Ä¶and he is not leash trained.¬† She tried to take him on a walk and he drug her and broke her wrist.¬† Just to recap‚Ä¶we now have Alyssa on record saying the dog is terrifying, Kelly Jo with an actual injury from the dog‚Ä¶ and Tiffy who obviously appears afraid of the dog.¬† Moving on‚Ä¶. The reveal is at Lydia‚Äôs parents‚Äô house and they all visibly hate Trace sticking a camera in their face.¬† Gil and Kelly show up separately and Josie is there alone‚Ä¶ with natural people looking hair.¬† Seriously‚Ä¶ where are the big, blow out curls she only seems to have in her bathroom? Anyway‚Ä¶ Lydia puts her siblings to work setting up an entire backdrop of white so they can sit on it with a white cake that Ryker is supposed to tear up and reveal the gender.¬† He doesn‚Äôt want to get cake all over his beige outfit, so he hits the cake with a spoon and‚Ä¶ surprise, surprise‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a girl.¬† Lydia is less than enthused. Trace Bates with a daughter‚Ä¶ yikes.


¬†
7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Erin Paine is living that suburban life now and happy that Chad has no choice but to let her document it all.¬† It‚Äôs JaneJane‚Äôs birthday and we see her kids facetiming with their great grandma.¬† She also films her family around the dinner table.¬† It‚Äôs a sobering look at very thin children, with heads bowed in prayer and plates sparsely filled with beans, lettuce and sour cream.¬† There is a basket of tortilla chips on the table and we see Chad side-eyeing the camera while clinching his jaw.¬† Good luck choking down that head of lettuce sprayed with sour cream CHEE-ADD.¬† This week‚Äôs vlog features Erin and Chad front and center, grasping each other‚Äôs hands and ready for a Q and A.¬† Erin is dressed like a PTA president from 1988 in a bright orange blazer and Chad is dressed like‚Ä¶a dead beat.¬† In any case‚Ä¶ this Q and A is really just a way to promote their products, and what they want future content to be.¬† Erin is marketing herself as a self-educated health guru and Chad is encouraging her. She continually looks to him for reassurance‚Ä¶ She also explains again why they are suddenly calling Carson his given name of Charles. After telling us that everyone has been calling him Charles for at least a year‚Ä¶ She immediately calls him Carson again. I‚Äôm not sure who she is attempting to convince.  They tell us over and over again how happy they are to have their church community to lift them up and help them‚Ä¶ The church gave them a washer and dryer, a swing set and helped with their moving expenses. Chad does not mention Work beyond saying he plans to build out a school room in the new rental. They both say this is the largest house they have ever lived in although Erin continues to say. it has been a huge adjustment for her, and she misses living in the country.  As soon as those cotton tops in that church realize that the Paine family are master grifters‚Ä¶ She will be back in the woods playing with goats.



    8. Michael and Brandon were not spotted all week. Their social media break should be coming to an end now that it‚Äôs February. I guess we will see what the Keilans have to offer‚Ä¶ Maybe Brandon will film Michael toiling away at the big house and running from one sibling‚Äôs house to the next caring for their children.



    9.  Lawson and Tiffany flew home from their Miami vacation and Lawson had to point out. He was crossing over the Gulf of America‚Ä¶ No one has to guess how terrible these people are because they show us daily. Tiffany posted another dumb Wife reel to her Instagram and showed plenty of close-ups of baby Will. Just to prove that she is equally as terrible as her husband‚Ä¶ She posts herself cheering that ‚ÄúAmerica is back baby.‚Äù  They show a few clips from their vacation and Tiffy tells us what a real man Lawson is because he is carrying all of the bags. They also received promotional gifts from Cracker Barrel and a baby clothing company. They finally drop a new Vlog and it starts three weeks ago when Nashville had a snowstorm. Lawson runs in and out of the house acting like a complete jackass over the snow while Tiffy over explains every single thing they are doing‚Ä¶ Lawson shows Duke the dog in their garage‚Ä¶ Lawson takes him out in the snow and tells us that Duke is now going back into the warm house with the family to hang beside the fireplace‚Ä¶ This is a lie because we later see Duke eating his food out in the garage‚Ä¶ We have never seen Duke inside the house lounging while Tiffy and the baby are there.  Every time Duke shows up‚Ä¶ Tiffany has a look of dread on her face.  They flashback to Christmas Eve in California with Tiffany‚Äôs family heading to the beach to see the sunset‚Ä¶ Lawson and Tiffany mention a sibling for Will or more babies at least four times. This is a super Lawson heavy Vlog, where Tiffy only makes a few appearances. This Vlog has about 100,000 less views than Lawson‚Äòs last Vlog featuring his dad‚Äòs birthday. Lawson wishes Trace and JebJud a happy birthday with several posts, including one where he and Trace are pretending to be a brooding young Elvis Presley. The King is surely rolling in his grave‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt feel so well myself.



    10. Kelly Jo has a bevy of birthdays to post about this week beginning with her mother-in-law Janie. Momma Jane is turning 85 and Kelly just now seems to be getting to know her. She also promotes a months worth of her kids Vlogs and says she‚Äôs had lots of time to catch up while she is recuperating. Everyone gets promoted so I guess Kris Jo  gets her 10%. Kelly really lays it on thick in Layla‚Äòs birthday post calling her a real life princess and the absolute star of their show. She also says Layla is mature beyond her years‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs five! She calls Trace her best friend in his birthday greeting and rains praises on him for all he does for Jeb‚Ä¶ She makes it sound like Trace and Lydia are raising the child.



Have a great week friends‚Ä¶ The groundhog saw its shadow and the crows are feeding in the fields‚Ä¶ My granddaddy used to say that meant the weather was going to be changing soon‚Ä¶ Sunshine and almost 80 in my neck of the woods this week gives me a little bit of spring fever!

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Josie Balka is back on social media and she is all in.¬† The hair pool noodles have restocked and you just know Josie‚Äôs baby hairs are screaming in terror for what is to come.¬† She sneaks a like on Kelly‚Äôs birthday post to Lexi Webster and that hasn‚Äôt happened in years.¬† We see a picture of baby Miles with Kelton at what appears to be a construction site‚Ä¶ are they building their McMansion yet?¬† Josie shares a minivlog of her 5am wake up that is really an ad for a protein powder.¬† After her workout, we see Hazel floating about in the ever present polyester princess dress.¬† Josie seems thinner than ever.¬† Josie decides to give her followers a tour of her nightstand because she has so many questions about what is on it.¬† She links a $170 alarm clock, $400 hair vitamins, Rihanna‚Äôs Fenti lip mask, and a $1400 bed cooling system.¬† SO damn relatable.¬† Meanwhile, her followers have an iphone to wake up, Suave shampoo and conditioner, Chapstick and an oscillating fan.¬† This week, Josie does every single thing while in her hair roller.¬† She bakes sourdough cinnamon rolls for Lydia, and films several tutorials and GRWMs. Her how to video has about 87 steps for washing and curling hair and the commenters say they don‚Äôt have that kind of time.¬† Josie appears to have endless time, even though she also has 3 children.¬† She tells us that she and Kelton are working hard to perfect latte art.¬† Every picture she shows on IG appears to be either a fist or‚Ä¶ lady parts.¬† But she‚Äôll keep trying because what else could she possibly have to do?¬† She films herself getting ready to get a haircut and rips the tags off of a brand new pair of Levi‚Äôs.¬† She tags and links the jeans so I guess they are a new sponsor.¬† She happily tells us the size of the jeans‚Ä¶ they are size 000/xxs and feature a 24 inch waist.¬† They have a built in button system to cinch the waist, and of course she needs the very last button.¬† Like I said‚Ä¶ girlie is thin. 


¬†
4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Alyssa Webster finally posted for Lexi‚Äôs birthday, after Kelly Jo stole her thunder.¬† It appears that Lexi‚Äôs birthday celebration involved a stop at her mom‚Äôs favorite coffee shop, a 20 dollar bill and a tiny little cake at her grandparent‚Äôs house.¬† At least she didn‚Äôt have to wait 5 months to celebrate this year.¬† Of course Lurch took her out on the yearly creepy daddy daughter date and it appears they went to the deserted park where Alyssa forced everyone to give her their most painful smile.¬† A random little girl appears in the pictures and Alyssa says her mom is a ‚Äúchildhood friend‚Äù‚Ä¶. Her name is Mary and I really believe she just happened to be at the park with her daughter and Alyssa convinced her to pose for a picture and have her face filtered off with the rest of them. Later in the week Alyssa reverts back to the new ‚ÄúClean‚Äù filter that leaves only nostrils and hair behind.¬† She sits in her car talking to her phone and tells us that she is patting herself on the back because she finally worked up the courage to take her heathen children to both a park and a bounce house.¬† She tries to keep a smile on her face as she fake laughs through a story about the chaos she and her 5 children caused at the bounce house.¬† I don‚Äôt understand why she makes these kids sound so awful, but maybe it‚Äôs because they never go anywhere and have no clue how to act in public?¬† Anyway, Rhett whined and cried and the others squirmed and called her name over and over and she came off like a desperate mom (her words) so the staff and other customers had to assist her.¬† She is saying all of this through a filter that gives her 2 holes in the middle of her face and fried wild hair and‚Ä¶ whew‚Ä¶ she is just a tragic figure.¬† Congratulations to the Webster kids for finally getting beyond the sidewalk.¬† Keep giving her hell!


¬†
5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Whitney Bates is a one woman show these days.¬† Her sidekick Carlin seems to be nowhere in sight and Whitney has to handle everything at the boutique as Carlin becomes a (very) silent partner.¬† BSB has started featuring a Bible verse on Sunday and they are pushing the ‚Äúmodest fashion‚Äù hashtag while also selling shorter and shorter dresses.¬† They are also selling sweaters for $80 and $80 jeans.¬† How long until their average price point is $100?¬† This week they took their $40 sale online and show markdowns that are only $10 off the original prices on most items.¬† While she runs the boutique, she is also not slouching on influencing and has scored a Chick-fil-a sponsorship.¬† In the comments, someone asks her what her husband does.¬† She says he ‚Äúdoes real estate‚Äù, helps at the boutique and ‚Äúhas fun‚Äù filming his cooking show.¬† We see you Whitney.¬† We HEAR you.¬† After a Chick-fil-a lunch, there is a tagged Waffle House supper, and then Whitney shows off a bowl of ground beef, tortilla chips and shredded cheese and calls it taco salad.¬† Zach shows up to take the girls to their tumbling lesson and that earns him major praise from the wife.¬† Whitney also has a Joanna Gaines sponsorship this week and shows off the new Magnolia cookbook.¬† Meanwhile, she tells the same tales over and over for the same products‚Ä¶it‚Äôs the same old easy plant, and the same old picture of a scrape on the skin repair ad.¬† In this week‚Äôs Bates Kitchen, it‚Äôs an old show featuring that jerk Chef Tim teaching Zach how to cook a frozen steak.¬† This was filmed when Zach had a messed up thumb so if you want to watch him stick his dirty hand brace in all the food‚Ä¶ this one is for you.


¬†
6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The world‚Äôs most boring pregnancy rolls on over at the Trace Bates house.¬† Lydia sends Trace out for a late night McDonald‚Äôs Sprite that she is craving and films him walking back in the house, chunking it at her and walking off, rolling his eyes.¬† Trying to drum up excitement for their gender (non)reveal, Lydia films a reel about old wives tales.¬† She says 8 of them fit a girl, and 3 fit a boy.¬† Then she takes Ryker to the mall to walk around and waste time.¬† The baby is dressed in all white.¬† Wonder how much she spends a month on Spray and Wash?¬† Commenters on her reel keep saying that they already know the baby‚Äôs gender because Trace said it in the Clark‚Äôs video‚Ä¶and Trace loses sleep staying up to delete every comment.¬† JebJud gets dropped off at the tiny house for a birthday sleep over.¬† I think this is the youngest JebJud and he shares a birthday with Trace.¬† The weekly vlog goes back in time almost 2 months to show their gender reveal.¬† First up though‚Ä¶ Trace reveals why Kelly is in a wrist cast.¬† She tells us that Duke the dog was staying with them‚Ä¶and he is not leash trained.¬† She tried to take him on a walk and he drug her and broke her wrist.¬† Just to recap‚Ä¶we now have Alyssa on record saying the dog is terrifying, Kelly Jo with an actual injury from the dog‚Ä¶ and Tiffy who obviously appears afraid of the dog.¬† Moving on‚Ä¶. The reveal is at Lydia‚Äôs parents‚Äô house and they all visibly hate Trace sticking a camera in their face.¬† Gil and Kelly show up separately and Josie is there alone‚Ä¶ with natural people looking hair.¬† Seriously‚Ä¶ where are the big, blow out curls she only seems to have in her bathroom? Anyway‚Ä¶ Lydia puts her siblings to work setting up an entire backdrop of white so they can sit on it with a white cake that Ryker is supposed to tear up and reveal the gender.¬† He doesn‚Äôt want to get cake all over his beige outfit, so he hits the cake with a spoon and‚Ä¶ surprise, surprise‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a girl.¬† Lydia is less than enthused. Trace Bates with a daughter‚Ä¶ yikes.


¬†
7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Erin Paine is living that suburban life now and happy that Chad has no choice but to let her document it all.¬† It‚Äôs JaneJane‚Äôs birthday and we see her kids facetiming with their great grandma.¬† She also films her family around the dinner table.¬† It‚Äôs a sobering look at very thin children, with heads bowed in prayer and plates sparsely filled with beans, lettuce and sour cream.¬† There is a basket of tortilla chips on the table and we see Chad side-eyeing the camera while clinching his jaw.¬† Good luck choking down that head of lettuce sprayed with sour cream CHEE-ADD.¬† This week‚Äôs vlog features Erin and Chad front and center, grasping each other‚Äôs hands and ready for a Q and A.¬† Erin is dressed like a PTA president from 1988 in a bright orange blazer and Chad is dressed like‚Ä¶a dead beat.¬† In any case‚Ä¶ this Q and A is really just a way to promote their products, and what they want future content to be.¬† Erin is marketing herself as a self-educated health guru and Chad is encouraging her. She continually looks to him for reassurance‚Ä¶ She also explains again why they are suddenly calling Carson his given name of Charles. After telling us that everyone has been calling him Charles for at least a year‚Ä¶ She immediately calls him Carson again. I‚Äôm not sure who she is attempting to convince.  They tell us over and over again how happy they are to have their church community to lift them up and help them‚Ä¶ The church gave them a washer and dryer, a swing set and helped with their moving expenses. Chad does not mention Work beyond saying he plans to build out a school room in the new rental. They both say this is the largest house they have ever lived in although Erin continues to say it has been a huge adjustment for her, and she misses living in the country.  As soon as those cotton tops in that church realize that the Paine family are master grifters‚Ä¶ She will be back in the woods playing with goats.



    8. Michael and Brandon were not spotted all week. Their social media break should be coming to an end now that it‚Äôs February. I guess we will see what the Keilans have to offer‚Ä¶ Maybe Brandon will film Michael toiling away at the big house and running from one sibling‚Äôs house to the next caring for their children.



    9.  Lawson and Tiffany flew home from their Miami vacation and Lawson had to point out he was crossing over the Gulf of America‚Ä¶ No one has to guess how terrible these people are because they show us daily. Tiffany posted another dumb Wife reel to her Instagram and showed plenty of close-ups of baby Will. Just to prove that she is equally as terrible as her husband‚Ä¶ She posts herself cheering that ‚ÄúAmerica is back baby.‚Äù  They show a few clips from their vacation and Tiffy tells us what a real man Lawson is because he is carrying all of the bags. They also received promotional gifts from Cracker Barrel and a baby clothing company. They finally drop a new Vlog and it starts three weeks ago when Nashville had a snowstorm. Lawson runs in and out of the house acting like a complete jackass over the snow while Tiffy over explains every single thing they are doing‚Ä¶ Lawson shows Duke the dog in their garage‚Ä¶ Lawson takes him out in the snow and tells us that Duke is now going back into the warm house with the family to hang beside the fireplace‚Ä¶ This is a lie because we later see Duke eating his food out in the garage‚Ä¶ We have never seen Duke inside the house lounging while Tiffy and the baby are there.  Every time Duke shows up‚Ä¶ Tiffany has a look of dread on her face.  They flashback to Christmas Eve in California with Tiffany‚Äôs family heading to the beach to see the sunset‚Ä¶ Lawson and Tiffany mention a sibling for Will or more babies at least four times. This is a super Lawson heavy Vlog, where Tiffy only makes a few appearances. This Vlog has about 100,000 less views than Lawson‚Äòs last Vlog featuring his dad‚Äòs birthday. Lawson wishes Trace and JebJud a happy birthday with several posts, including one where he and Trace are pretending to be a brooding young Elvis Presley. The King is surely rolling in his grave‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt feel so well myself.



    10. Kelly Jo has a bevy of birthdays to post about this week beginning with her mother-in-law Janie. Momma Jane is turning 85 and Kelly just now seems to be getting to know her. She also promotes a months worth of her kids Vlogs and says she‚Äôs had lots of time to catch up while she is recuperating. Everyone gets promoted so I guess Kris Jo  gets her 10%. Kelly really lays it on thick in Layla‚Äòs birthday post calling her a real life princess and the absolute star of their show. She also says Layla is mature beyond her years‚Ä¶ She‚Äôs five! She calls Trace her best friend in his birthday greeting and rains praises on him for all he does for Jeb‚Ä¶ She makes it sound like Trace and Lydia are raising the child.



Have a great week friends‚Ä¶ The groundhog saw its shadow and the crows are feeding in the fields‚Ä¶ My granddaddy used to say that meant the weather was going to be changing soon‚Ä¶ Sunshine and almost 80 in my neck of the woods this week gives me a little bit of spring fever!

‚ÄúAlright, everyone, it‚Äôs time for ‚ÄòOn This Day 10 Years Ago,‚Äô‚Äù our editor announced, kicking off our Monday meeting.

This was our weekly ritual: revisiting notable events from a decade prior and assigning stories. A niche concept, but people loved digging up the past, especially the dark stuff. Think of us as a ‚ÄúWhatever Happened To‚Ä¶‚Äù for those obsessed with reliving human misery.

December 21 ‚Äì Winter Solstice ‚Äì gave us plenty of material: darkness, survival, winter madness (The Shining, anyone?), and other morbid tales. After a rundown, we claimed our pieces.

‚ÄúJimmy, you‚Äôre on the ‚ÄòJefferson Junior High Band Fire,‚Äô‚Äù Roger assigned.

I grimaced. ‚ÄúCan I hear the other options? Reporting on grieving families and band-aides isn‚Äôt my vibe today.‚Äù

‚ÄúToo late,‚Äù Roger shot back. ‚ÄúBesides, you‚Äôve got all year. Nothing says Christmas like Krampus.‚Äù

‚ÄúKrampus is overdone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not the editor,‚Äù Roger said, dismissing the argument with a belly-cupping lean.

I spent the morning researching‚Äîrefreshing myself on the band story and tumbling into the eerie rabbit hole of Krampus folklore. Later, I packed up to attend my daughter Erica‚Äôs holiday band concert.

The event was classic: dressed-up kids, proud families, and squeaky renditions of festive songs. With winter break officially underway, I promised my wife, Rowan, and Erica I‚Äôd take a week off work. I mostly stuck to it, though reading up on Krampus didn‚Äôt feel entirely like cheating.

By January 1, I was ready to dive back in.

\*\*\*\*\*

The Jefferson Junior High Band Disaster occurred on December 21, 2014, in Cordova, Wisconsin, a town known for its location between the North Pole and equator, music festivals, and a devastating fire at the school. The fire during a band concert claimed 56 students, 110 family members, and 8 staff members, trapping them inside an auditorium where the doors locked automatically. Despite footage being removed from the school‚Äôs website, it still exists online.

The band's last song, ‚ÄúKrampus Comes to Christmas,‚Äù included eerie narration before things went horribly wrong. Survivors‚Äô accounts are unclear, but one person, Kel, the sound guy, filmed the disaster. His footage reportedly shows a giant flaming ball and Krampus appearing, followed by chaos and screams. Kel, now in a psychiatric hospital, accidentally knocked the camera, capturing only screams and a dark scene.

The official story was that faulty doors and an electrical fire caused the tragedy. Since then, the school‚Äôs band program has been canceled, and the auditorium remains untouched. I‚Äôm now heading to Cordova to investigate further, with a list of two people to speak to: Shelly O‚ÄôCavenaugh, the band director‚Äôs widow and Liesel Evans, the principal. There are a few more randoms I might be able to meet ‚Äì not too many, but a few people responded to the Facebook Post we put out looking for leads.

\*\*\*



The North Woods in the winter are bleak. It is dark for much of the day ‚Äì the sun usually doesn‚Äôt rise until 8:00, and it begins to set around 4:00. It‚Äôs also cold ‚Äì the cold that drives people in ‚Äì either to their homes or to bars. Snow blankets the ground and the buildings, and won‚Äôt melt until March. This insular quality can be charming if you‚Äôre up there for something like snowshoeing or cross country skiing. But, when you‚Äôre turning up stories about a mass child casualty, it can seal you like a tomb.



I got into town after the long drive, much of which was on two-lane country roads. I settled into my room in the town motel, and took the front desk clerk‚Äôs advice to have dinner at Otto‚Äôs ‚Äì the local bar and grill. The building creaked, as the wind battered the old windows; ice was building inside the rooms. I‚Äôll tell you, the entire time I was there, I don‚Äôt think I took off my coat. Obviously, I was an outsider.¬†



While this town had its share of visitors during the summer months and in the wake of the tragedy, my outsider vibe stood out like a banner. In a back booth, I sipped my Spotted Cow, and dug into my burger, while I read over some notes.¬†



‚ÄúYou busy?‚Äù a gruff voice asked from behind.



I looked up to see a middle aged man, full beard, a lot of camo, standing at my table with three other men, who could be related, or could have just adopted the same Wisconsin winter look.¬†



‚ÄúNo, not really,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù



‚ÄúWe heard you‚Äôre hear to talk about what happened at Jefferson. That Krampus stuff.‚Äù



He said it as a statement ‚Äì which was slightly accusatory.¬†



‚ÄúWell, yeah. I got assigned the story for my job. I wanted to see it, and talk to a few people.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo one‚Äôs left, you know. That wiped out our kids ‚Äì most of our friends. Anyone who did live, we drove away. Don‚Äôt put your nose where it doesn‚Äôt belong, you read me? We let those others leave because they‚Äôre one of ours. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôd treat you so kindly, if you catch my drift.‚Äù



With that, they strode away, and returned to their seats at the bar, turning back frequently, for effect ‚Äì or to see if what they said was enough to make me leave.¬†



It was. I quickly finished, left some money on the table, and returned to my room. When i got to my door, I saw a piece of paper folded into the door jamb. I took it, and quickly brought it inside, double latching the door behind me. Taking a breath, I opened it. It was a faded postcard. A grotesque creature with horns and chains loomed over a terrified child. ‚ÄúSeason‚Äôs Beatings!‚Äù it read. Beneath the cheap humor, the image stirred an unease I couldn‚Äôt shake. Probably those guys ‚Äì punctuating the message.



I learned that Shelly and Liesel no longer lived in Cordova, likely because they weren‚Äôt welcome after the fire. My plan to get reactions from the townsfolk was now off the table. Instead, I'd visit the site the next day for photos, then head north to find Shelly and Liesel.¬†



That night, I barely slept, worried the men from the bar might come after me. The wind howled against the window, and the sound of a loose shutter kept waking me, making me think they were at my door.¬† My mind also kept drifting to Krampus. The terrifying images of him‚Äîhalf-goat, half-demon, leading a procession with flaming torches, chains, bells, and a bundle of birch branches‚Äîhaunted me. The unsettling sound of his bells and the thought of the sack he used for capturing misbehaving children made the nightmares worse.



\*\*\*\*\*



Groggy, I woke up, thankful for surviving the night. It was early yet, no later than 6. I stopped at a gas station, got some coffee, and headed to the site of the junior high. The building stood ‚Äì the area where the auditorium had been was changed into a memorial. Though it was still dark out, the memorial was lit brightly. All the names of the children, towns members, and staff were listed ‚Äì except for Director Karl O‚ÄôCavenaugh. This was intentional, I found out. As I stood, taking pictures, I heard a light clicking behind me. I paused and listened, and heard the clicking magnified. Afraid I had been founded, I turned quickly.



Behind me, a herd of deer had gathered, their glassy eyes fixed on me. They stood motionless, save for the occasional flick of an ear. My breath caught‚Äîthe stillness wasn‚Äôt natural. Somewhere in the back of my mind, a snippet of folklore surfaced: animals sense what humans can‚Äôt. Suddenly, they all began to slowly shake their heads, left and right. Motionless, I watched. I heeded their warning, and moved towards my car, avoiding the herd. As I drove away, they continued to watch me, in disdain, as I headed into the darkness.¬†



On the way, I had to see more than 40 deer. Many were mangy, fur coming off in patches. I couldn‚Äôt drive more than 40 miles an hour, straining my eyes as I watched the sides of the road. Each one did the same thing ‚Äì shaking it‚Äôs head, as if telling me this was not a good idea. I was already 7 hours from home, and I was close, I could feel it. I‚Äôd talk to Shelly. Find a place to stay, head up to Liesel‚Äôs and see if I could at least get a ‚ÄúNo Comment‚Äù in person. And, then I‚Äôd drive the 9 hours home and be done with this.¬†

\*\*\*\*\*

Shelly had returned my emails. As the widow of the band director, she had lost her husband in the fire ‚Äì and should have been there. Her son was sick, so she stayed home with him, viewing the concert on TV. Shelly was well-liked ‚Äì she was a secretary at the elementary school, and had grown up in Cordova. Some expressed their sympathies ‚Äì it wasn‚Äôt her fault. But most expressed a persistent, persuasive controlled isolation that gave her the message she was no longer welcome in town. Her parents had died in the fire ‚Äì they had gone to the Christmas Concert for as long as she could remember. With no one left but David, she moved an hour North, changed her last name, and took a job at the Walmart.



She had settled in Winterland, Wisconsin. The name was fitting as I worked my way through the narrow main road. Snow removal was a creative endeavor in small towns like this ‚Äì mounds of white were pushed in the center of the road, and filled large parking lots, creating mountains among the squat building. Shelly‚Äôs home was on a side street, and I parked somewhat in the middle of the road. I had not seen another car the whole way up from Cordova, and there were no cars out this morning, either. Shelly was waiting by the window, expectantly, as I walked up, and met me at the door.¬†



‚ÄúQuick, come in,‚Äù she said, pulling the door shut behind her. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt want to let the cold air in,‚Äù she said nervously, taking my jacket.



The home was warm, and cozy. It smelled of soup and coffee. We sat in the front room, and Shelly wrapped in a crocheted blanket. She recounted, slowly, the evening. At first we focused on her ‚Äì i always find you get to the story once you get them talking about themselves. We talked about her guilt ‚Äì for not being there, and the way the townspeople treated her like she had a contagious disease, causing her and David to move up North. David, for his part, no longer a small child, but now an adult, passed in and out. He had on headphones ‚Äì the large kind, and didn‚Äôt acknowledge our presence.¬†



‚ÄúI think he‚Äôs had a mental break. Noises bother him ‚Äì any noise. He wasn‚Äôt really like that before his dad died. I did keep the house very quiet after this happened. No music, no TV. I didn‚Äôt want to see the news, and any music reminded me of Karl. So, we lived in silence. I think it shocked Davey‚Äôs system ‚Äì he went from a house full of of instruments and singing and dancing ‚Äì to silence.‚Äù



Her recollection of the events were similar to what Kel‚Äôs video had shown. According to her, the lines read ‚Äì mixed in to be narrated over the band, which played discordant chords, were written to summon the beast himself. It had been a rumor, among the music community. Something like this had happened before at the first performance. Only, in that case, the group performing were in a sound studio. But, that space had also caught on fire, and the doors to the studio showed marks from where the musicians had tried to claw their way out before they burned alive, being found in pugilistic posture with a clenched position due to the contraction of muscles in the heat. Karl had heard this ‚Äì but, when he found the piece, he was convinced it wasn‚Äôt true. And, he reasoned, if it was, Liesel would have told him no.



In all my research, I had not heard of this case. I questioned her on this.



‚ÄúThey changed the name. It had gotten a little press in Nashville, I think. But, they just changed the name ‚Äì not the words, not the song.‚Äù



She looked down, and I saw a teardrop on her folded hands.



‚ÄúWe ruined a town. We killed them. And, now I‚Äôve ruined my son. We ruined Christmas.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo, no. These things happen. Really ‚Äì look, I write about stuff like this all the time. There‚Äôs always a logical explanation ‚Äì which doesn‚Äôt make it better. But, it‚Äôs not his fault.‚Äù



She looked up, her face suddenly changed. Her looked angry, her mouth drawn.



‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs Ms. Evans. If she hadn‚Äôt approved this song ‚Äì had just said something, it never would have been chosen. She had the authority. It was her job. And, she told him to play it.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo what you‚Äôre saying is, Karl had to have his music approved? And, Liesel, gave him the greenlight.‚Äù



‚ÄúYes ‚Äì it was her. She was the evil one. She‚Äôs the one who told him to try something new. She‚Äôs the one who gave him the idea to check out the warehouse. Do you know this music was over 75 years old? It had been stored for a reason. But, since she got out ‚Äì she goes on. And, no one cares.‚Äù



This was interesting. I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about Liesel, other than the fact that she had escaped. It made more sense about how she had reacted to my requests. There wasn‚Äôt much more to talk about, and I timed it out so I could make the couple hour drive during daylight to Lake Superior. I thanked her.¬†



As I made my way to the door, she handed me an envelope.¬†



‚ÄúJust open this when you get where you‚Äôre going.‚Äù I nodded.



Getting back into my car, I turned on the defrost. The heat I generated on the way up had left a sheen of ice on the interior of my car. Opening the envelope ‚Äì she couldn‚Äôt see me anyway in this ice box, I found the narrator‚Äôs lines for the Krampus song. According to her account ‚Äì as soon as the final line was read, the fire began. How these words ever made it into a middle school band concert are beyond me:



In the cold of winter's grip,A shadow stirs with frosty lip,Hooves that echo, chains that clink,Krampus comes with eyes that blink.

Fur like night and horns like stone,He moves through towns where lights have grown,A whistle sharp, a chilling sound,A monstrous figure, creeping 'round.

With a sack to carry children‚Äôs cries,He steals away beneath dark skies.The bell‚Äôs harsh jingle rings the doom,As flames rise high in endless gloom.

He knows the weak, he knows the sin,And haunts the hearts that dwell within.A cruel laugh splits the silent air,For Krampus seeks those who despair.

Beware the night, the cold and fear,When Krampus‚Äô steps draw ever [near.No](http://near.No) prayer will save, no door will lock,His cold embrace the final shock.

In neat script, Shelly (I assume) had written:

*These are the words that were read;¬† I don‚Äôt believe any copies remain. You need to see the words, you need to understand that this is what brought Krampus. If they‚Äôre uttered aloud, he comes. Please do not print, and please destroy.*¬†

So, these words were read ‚Äì and the town ended up dead. It was chilling. I imagined the kids ‚Äì screaming, as the fire spread. The parents, trying to find their children, and having these words be the last thing they heard ‚Äì aside from the anguished screams engulfed in smoke and flames. I looked up ‚Äì and my windshield was clear. I put my car in reverse, and stopped immediately ‚Äì flagged by the back up detector.¬†

Looking through my rearview mirror ‚Äì I caught the reflection of a buck. Its horns stretched outward, it had to be a 14-point buck. He stood there, steam emanating from his nostrils. Like all the deer before him, he slowly shook his head. Again. I kind of waved my acknowledgement, and went as quickly as I could to the main road to take me out of Winterland, and on to Baycliff.

\*\*\*\*\*

Liesel had been a little less forthcoming in our discussions. Liesel was also at the concert ‚Äì she had left before the final song, checking her cell phone. She too had a sick one at home ‚Äì her other two boys, though, were in band. The babysitter had called, asking if Nate could have some ice cream ‚Äì he had made a miraculous recovery ‚Äì and while explaining no in five different ways, she heard the doors click behind her, and then the screams. When interviewed about it, she had tired to get it ‚Äì reports indicate she actually scratched into the heavy wood doors with her nails in an attempt to pry them open.. Liesel had left town not long after the fire; she resigned, and headed even farther north, to Lake Superior, with Nate. They too took new names. She was not willing to do an interview ‚Äì but, I can be pretty convincing. And, the benefit of sparsely populated places ‚Äì you can find people pretty easily.



Baycliff was almost in Michigan. On the most northern point of the state, it was even colder, and even more bleak. There was no motel in Baycliff ‚Äì in fact, it was not even a true town, and from what I had gathered, Liesel didn‚Äôt live in town. I made my way into Ashland, found a room, and quickly got fast food. I didn‚Äôt want to run into locals. I didn‚Äôt want to see more deer. The same thing that had happened on the way to Winterland happened on the way here. Deer ‚Äì everywhere. In various forms of decay, lined the road. Each of them stared at my approach and passing, their black eyes fixed, their heads shaking slowly.



The night proved uneventful ‚Äì aside from the banging of the wind, and the dreams of Krampus. I awoke, and lay in bed, lulled by the sound of the radiator blasting heat. Getting up to make coffee, I pulled aside the heavy curtain to see if it was yet light. I took a step back when I saw a shadowy, horned figure etched into the frost on the window, resembling Krampus. It wasn‚Äôt a simple condensation pattern or a natural frost formation; it was deliberate, almost as though someone‚Äîor something‚Äîhad crafted it overnight. The room felt small, as this image only reiterated what I was feeling ‚Äì I had been marked. This eerie omen was left, as if the creature had marked me for some unknown purpose. I felt as if I was being watched, trapped in a cycle I couldn‚Äôt escape. I went outside, felt the blast of the below zero temperatures, and tried to scape off the ice from the window. Then, I quickly packed up my room, got dressed, and headed to a local diner for breakfast.



I scanned the room again, my eyes darting to the door every few minutes, and then focused on my coffee. When the waitress came back to refill my cup, I decided she seemed harmless enough.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù I began, keeping my tone casual. ‚ÄúYou wouldn‚Äôt happen to know a woman around here with a son‚Äîhe‚Äôd be about 18 now. Moved up this way maybe ten years ago?‚Äù

She tilted her head, giving me a curious look. ‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶ you mean Lila? Why? What‚Äôs going on? She in some kind of trouble?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, no, nothing like that,‚Äù I said quickly, forcing a laugh. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just an old friend. We were supposed to catch up while I was passing through, but I misplaced her address. And her number, too, somehow.‚Äù I added a sheepish shrug for good measure.

The waitress seemed to relax, her suspicion melting into mild interest. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs who I‚Äôm thinking of, she‚Äôs out by Beaver Creek. Not much out there but trees and a couple of houses. She‚Äôs kind of‚Ä¶ different, you know? Keeps to herself. Her son‚Äôs a hell of an athlete, though. I think he‚Äôs headed to college in Florida next year. I saw something about it in the paper.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gotta be her,‚Äù I said, nodding as if I were relieved. ‚ÄúWeird Lila. Yeah, that‚Äôs what we used to call her,‚Äù I added with a chuckle, trying to sell the lie.

The waitress didn‚Äôt seem to notice anything off and went back to tidying up behind the counter, clearly satisfied with the exchange. Just another stranger in a town happy to gossip about someone on the fringe.

When my food came, I thanked her, ate about half of it, and left some cash on the table. My stomach churned as I walked to the car, though I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was from the food or something else entirely.

I pulled up Beaver Creek on my GPS and started east, trying to shake the uneasy feeling that settled over me. I didn‚Äôt like this place, didn‚Äôt like how it made my skin crawl, but I had to find Lila‚Äîor at least say I tried. Then, maybe, I could leave this town behind for good and get back to Illinois.

¬†



\*\*\*\*\*



The drive, as all had been, was desolate. The landscape was white ‚Äì the ground, the road, the trees ‚Äì the sky had even taken on the quality of blankness. The only contrast were the dark shape of deer, spotted every so often along the road. Only, now they appeared more sinister. I know they were deer. But they looked different ‚Äì larger, with larger horns. Their faces took on the look of something sinister. Their eyes blacker. I avoided their gaze and kept my head straight until I hit a road that ran along the river.¬†



The water churned, dark and brown. The road had one single set of tire marks in it, and I followed those, hoping this was the clue I needed. It was. About a quarter mile up, I saw a Baycliff High School Banner, with the last name Nilsen, and the first name Nathan. I would bet this one was them. And, the tracks I had been following went right to this home. Smoke billowed from the chimney of a small, river stone home. I parked in the drive, and opened my door. The blast of the cold stopped me momentarily.¬†



As I walked to the front door, I saw movement in the window, just the flutter of a curtain. Before I reached the front door, it opened quickly.¬†



‚ÄúWell, you are certainly persistent,‚Äù said a small woman, with gray hair and large classes.¬†



Thought I was at least a foot taller than her, she was intimidating, even in a purple sweatsuit. This was her ‚Äì I could tell she was a principal by her stance and the way she seemed to look right into my conscious.



‚ÄúLiesel?‚Äù I asked.¬†



‚ÄúYes, unfortunately. You might as well come in ‚Äì no sense standing in the cold, and letting all my heat out. Take off your boots.‚Äù



I did as I was told, and entered the home.¬†



I would love to tell you I got to the bottom of this. And, that there was a rational explanation for everything. That wasn‚Äôt the case. As we sat down, we began to talk about her time in Cordova over coffee. Nate wasn‚Äôt home; he was working in Ashland at the Home Depot. He was going to Florida on an athletic scholarship, and Liesel planned on following down there. Winter wasn‚Äôt the same, Christmas had been ruined. It was pretty much the same feeling Shelly had shared. Liesel lost her two sons that day, and she and Nathan had decided to not celebrate the holiday anymore. Liesel‚Äôs husband had left her, taking hsi own life a few years after, addled by alcohol and grief.¬†



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much left to tell. It was awful. It was the worst day of my life. There have been days I wish we were all in there together, and there were days I wished I never made the older two play an instrument. But, you can‚Äôt ask questions. You‚Äôll find answers you didn‚Äôt need to know.‚Äù



‚ÄúI do have one more question, if you don‚Äôt mind,‚Äù I said, pulling the envelope out of my coat pocket. ‚ÄúI saw Shelly. She gave me something. A poem, it looks like‚Ä¶‚Äù



Liesel shot up immediately, and in one swift movement, grabbed me by the arm, pulling me out of the seat.



‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù she said, picking up my boots. She opened the door and threw them outside.¬†



‚ÄúGet out!‚Äù she said again ‚Äì louder this time. She looked into the treeline, back and forth, her eyes filled in terror. ‚ÄúWhy would you bring that! That lady wanted you to summon them. She has never accepted she wasn‚Äôt the only one who lost anything. We all lost. A part of all of us died that day. But this ‚Äì she won‚Äôt let it stop. If you‚Äôve read it ‚Äì even to yourself, you‚Äôve summoned it. Get out, and don‚Äôt come back. Don‚Äôt even take that out again.‚Äù



With that, I stood there, shocked. I too looked around, as the door bolts click, click, clicked.¬†



What had I done? What did Shelly do to me?



\*\*\*\*\*



I drove back to Illinois as quickly as I could. The trip was a blur. I kept my eyes on the road, and didn‚Äôt reach home until midnight. Somewhere, on a lone stretch of highway, I had taken the envelope and threw it out the window. The words, harmless, probably, made me paranoid. Having them on me, or even near me, was too much. My only hope was they‚Äôd be picked up by a snowplow, and gone forever.



Back in town, I was anxious to get this written and out of my hands. At this point, I was hoping I wouldn‚Äôt be on staff by the time this was published. None of this felt right, and I didn‚Äôt want to be associated with the story I was about to write. Once done, I‚Äôd put out my feelers and find a position writing about prep sports or something.



Roger loved the story ‚Äì of course, sick bastard. It had just enough mystery. I didn‚Äôt include anything about the poem, and I embellished a bit. The final printed article suggested that Liesel admitted the doors were done in a shoddy way; it was the doors. The fire had been due to a malfunctioning sound system they were aiming to replace.¬†



Krampus did not cause this. Krampus‚Äôs words were not to blame. Now, if only I could convince myself of this, I would be fine. It wasn‚Äôt that easy though. Each month, something would happen, taking me back to those three days up North. Deer, stopping and judging. Krampus images showing up out of season. Banners across internet pages, where his sinister smile would seemingly eat me alive.

  


August 2025



I did end up finding that other job. Jimmy Jansen was now the beat reporter for local sports in the Glendale area ‚Äì and, I couldn‚Äôt be happier. Very little drama ‚Äì aside from the sidelined hero dealing with a torn ACL. I could handle that. The hours were better too, and there was no travel ‚Äì which meant no deer.



I finished early, one afternoon, and let Rowen know I would pick up Erica. She had started a new year, and I was eager to get a little more one on one time with her. I watched her come out and make her way to my car after leaving her friends.¬†



‚ÄúHow was the day,‚Äù I asked, easing out of the pickup line, glancing at her, smiling.



‚ÄúReally, really good. Guess what?‚Äù I loved when Erica was this animated. I was so fortunate to have some an amazing kid ‚Äì it got me thinking about Cordova, and all those families. All that tragedy. I thought of Shelly, alone with Davey in Winterland ‚Äì a perpetual winter for them. I wondered what Liesel was doing, and if Nate made it to Florida. I was lucky.¬†



‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked, keeping my eyes on the road.



She continued,¬† ‚ÄúWe already picked Christmas music for the concert ‚Äì and, we‚Äôre doing this really, really weird piece. Mr. Brown said it‚Äôs not even published anymore ‚Äì something about some tragedy. Anyway, he found an old copy in the music room. It‚Äôs about this guy ‚Äì his name is Krampus. Have you heard of him? Anyway, he‚Äôs super weird and is the opposite of Santa ‚Äì so he like, beats you if you‚Äôre bad. Anyway, it‚Äôs called ‚ÄúKrampus Comes to Christmas‚Äù and I get to be the reader ‚Äì I read all this really dark stuff about him coming for all of us. Isn‚Äôt that cool? I am already counting down to Christmas‚Ä¶‚Äù

This was all fine with me, so I checked in and easily found a seat to set up and work.

This place was tranquil. Sure, it had the amenities of a dentist office waiting room. But it was a quiet and peaceful place to get some work done.

The best part...observing all the people showing up en masse and abruptly turning around when they heard about the restrictions above. Large groups, the stroller brigade, and so on. ""Oh, I guess we'll eat somewhere else."" ""Where is the food court?""

It reminded me of how the Sky Clubs used to be 10+ years ago.

When I went February

Who went just me for a staycation 

Rooms booked a king room with a garden view that was very comfortable and nice. Watching the sunset from the huge windows was definitely a bonus and the bed was Amazingly comfortable 

Service 5
Honestly some pretty bad service overall unfortunately. Not so bad that I think you should never stay there but bad enough that I had multiple weird experiences. Felt way more like 3 star hotel service. For example- I booked the winter offering which came with meal credit and a spa discount but they kept acting like the spa credit didn‚Äôt exist even after I showed them my receipt? Then took soooo long to manually go in after a ton of back and forth. I saw another couple go through this same thing right after me and the line itself for checking in was randomly long. 

My room wasn‚Äôt ready until 430 which again was fine because I was out and about but again odd for the price point to have no apology or even acknowledgement that the room wasn‚Äôt ready at check in (4pm). I left my bag with the front desk and they said that my bag would be in my room when it was ready however I had to call multiple times to even get it sent up later that evening. 

My massage was great but felt some pressure to get upgrades and the steam room was out of order which is a bummer for a nice spa. They comped with a glass of champagne but honestly I don‚Äôt even like champagne! Also the masseuse was talented but in the last 5 minutes after only doing my back she asked what I would like her to focus on as she only had five minutes left even though it was supposed to be full body?? Not the most relaxing end unfortunately.

Property 9: the property is beautiful so close to fun restaurants and shopping in dumbo and the waiters were super nice. However the bar was not that busy and took forever to take my order. But it was nice to get a free glass of wine at happy hour! 

The lobby is gorgeous and the rooftop bar has the most amazing sunset views. 

Food 6
I was having a staycation so I ordered in for dinner one night and breakfast a couple days. Food was mediocre at best and doesn‚Äôt make sense to order when you‚Äôre so close to so many amazing restaurants.
The eggs I got were watery and coffee was luke warm. The fruit bowl was like from an airport üòÇ.
I also got a smash burger one night and it was honestly bad. The fries are yummy tho! 

The osprey restaurant itself is good but definitely not the best option for food in the area. 

Overall, everyone was nice the hotel is beautiful and in a convenient area but the service left something to be desired. You‚Äôre better off staying at the William vale or Wythe than here in my opinion! ",10,1738539484.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

**Does Java Burn Work?**



The effectiveness of Java Burn has been a topic of interest for many potential users. Based on the scientific principles behind its formulation and the positive user testimonials, there is a strong argument that it can indeed work as intended. The combination of coffee with the proprietary blend of nutrients in Java Burn is designed to enhance metabolism, increase fat-burning, and support energy levels throughout the day.



Many users have reported noticeable results when incorporating Java Burn into their daily routine. These results may vary from person to person, depending on individual metabolism, lifestyle, and adherence to the recommended usage guidelines. However, the general consensus is that Java Burn can provide a helpful boost for those who are looking to enhance their weight loss efforts.



It is essential to note that while Java Burn can support weight loss, it is not a magic solution. For optimal results, it should be combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. This aligns with the broader understanding of weight management, which emphasizes that supplements can be effective tools but should not replace healthy lifestyle choices.



In summary, Java Burn appears to work for many users by leveraging the natural benefits of coffee and enhancing them with its unique formula. While individual results may vary, there is enough evidence to suggest that it can be a valuable addition to a weight loss regimen.

1igb44c,https://www.reddit.com/r/AstralProjection/comments/1igb44c/dont_forget_to_taste_your_coffee/,Don‚Äôt Forget To Taste Your Coffee,"I think it would make more sense for me to start almost backwards. A few days ago, I had an opportunity to sit and speak with what I consider to be a great mentor and friend. I was seeking advice to a recently very big change in my life. I went to him through a sort of natural sequence. We work together and bonded over long talks of Ekhart Tollie, meditation, and spirituality. I‚Äôd like to think he plants seeds in my head and always gives me plenty to chew on. But that‚Äôs a story for another time. 

During our conversation, he says ‚Äúso I see your meditation is working then.‚Äù I did not think so. Or at least I didn‚Äôt see it in that way before him bringing it to my attention. He says this because I‚Äôve come to a sort of self realization. And now I see it in a way that I don‚Äôt think I would have gotten to this point without meditation. This realization is that I have a bad relationship with cannabis. 

This seed started to sprout because I‚Äôve been very focused and strict on meditating every day. I ran into a roadblock. I could feel myself not growing - I wanted more out of my meditations. This all brought me to the idea of being clear mindedness. I told myself maybe this is the problem. Maybe because I am high, I cannot grasp a level of clear mindedness that is needed. There really wasn‚Äôt any other reason in my mind to stop smoking. It was really only to see if I can quiet my mind more during meditation. I didn‚Äôt think there was any issue other than that. 

It‚Äôs funny how we convince ourselves of things. I use cannabis to sleep, I use it to clear my mind, I have pain (which is semi true so I have yet to figure that out). Or as a crutch, you don‚Äôt deal with the things happening now, even if it is a bad day, at least I get to go home and smoke so let‚Äôs just ignore and not deal. 

I‚Äôm terrible with wording things, and maybe I‚Äôd like to see myself work on that so I can express myself better. But it really all comes down to this- I think weed can be a tool maybe used once in a blue moon for meditation and such, but other than that I think I realize it‚Äôs no good. I was doing some research as well, it messes up your sleep cycle to where you don‚Äôt dream and don‚Äôt even really fully rest correctly. Weed has taught me that it makes you comfortable feeling uncomfortable. You don‚Äôt handle your emotions correctly, you can‚Äôt think clearly. I feel a lot more connected with everyone. The emotions were very strong the first couple of days, it‚Äôs still intense for sure everything that I didn‚Äôt deal with for the last 10 years correctly. Probably gonna take some time.  It‚Äôs only been a few days and I feel more present and I‚Äôm hoping that it only grows. The power of presence is everything to me now. I really think you can only elevate yourself so much with weed. Yes, it can help you see new perspective and be very useful, but if that‚Äôs all you know it‚Äôs no good if you know what I mean. I never really thought of myself as an addict, but it sure does feel that way. A lot of other things too, can‚Äôt sleep anymore I‚Äôm lucky if I can get 3/4 hours a night. Dreams about all kinds of things that I didn‚Äôt deal with from the past. To be present is everything. To sit and enjoy your coffee and to watch the sun. To not be caught up in past emotions and emotions of the future. I told my mentor that I was scared for my future, that I wouldn‚Äôt feel the same without weed - but as he told me ‚Äúare you tired of watching the same episode over and over again? Isn‚Äôt it time for a new one?‚Äù I‚Äôm scared of change, and I think most people are but change can lead to a lot of big things. I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I will get out of all of this, but I‚Äôd like to keep an open mind. I stopped for chances of better meditation, that was the goal, but as you see there‚Äôs a lot along the way. So I guess the moral of the story is don‚Äôt forget to taste your coffee 

My plan is to take a break from these things. I hope I can get to a point in the future where I can smoke from time to time, maybe on a Friday meditation or maybe a Saturday when I‚Äôm hanging out with friends. Again, cannabis is not good nor bad. It‚Äôs a double edge sword, you just have to be very careful and respectful towards these things and yourself using them.

I know this is probably kinda sad but sometimes I feel like I cannot get through my shifts without some sort of ‚Äúreward‚Äù. I just use them as something to keep me going. 
So does anyone have any advice on how I can avoid this?

1igb0hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/vagabond/comments/1igb0hk/got_attacked_and_boarded_last_night/,Got attacked and boarded last night...,"I got woken up by the sound of something hammering on my deck right above where I sleep. I could hear my solar panel wires being moved back and forth violently. Tap tap tap tap tap tap tap! Yelling. Wires moving. Tap tap tap tap! Yelling. Wires moving. Tap tap tap tap tap tap! Yelling. Tap tap tap tap tap tap!

'Sounds like I've been boarded by enemies.' Out of bed. Tactical flip flops on. Companionway hatch and door open. Out on deck ready for battle.

One of the birds I've been chasing off the boat  flies off. Just one. At a time when birds are usually sleeping. No other invaders in sight.

He decided he wasn't having this person taking over his sweet ass boat, and was gonna come declare war. By himself. At four in the morning.

I lived in what used to be a prayer house from an 1800s church years ago. I had a couple warblers build a nest in the prayer box right above my couch. Watched them build a nest, lay eggs, hatch babies, raise them, and call them out of the nest to go live their lives elsewhere. All within a few feet from my head. It's one of my favorite experiences in life. 

I have the feeling the attacker this morning was the original one who came out when I was still here. I was cool with him and later his partner coming out. I kinda figured they might hatch some chicks. I'm cool with helping the animal world out a little. I didn't know at the time that I was leaving.

I've scoured the deck from the first morning on to make sure there aren't any nests built or eggs laying in ropes. There's nothing. I've looked in every nook and cranny. There really isn't anywhere they could hide them. No signs that they're using anything as nest material. Nothing.

Word got around in the bird world that it was a safe place to sleep. Can't blame them for that, but I have to evict them. The amount of bird shit is staggering. My deck is typically close to spotless. 

I know they're gonna come back as soon as I leave, but at least they'll be used to the idea of not being here when I get back. Most of the forty or so that were here when I got back got the hint and haven't returned. There's about ten left that give it a couple tries every night, and then fly off and don't return.

I've got to admire this little guy. He didn't give one fuck about the odds. He felt wronged, and was gonna risk it all to try and get rid of me. Gotta have some respect for that.

In other news...

I finally got to wake up, make some coffee, and sit here enjoying my coffee and a couple smokes while listening to some tunes. It was glorious! Once the coffee kicked in I text my friend. I'm running low on drinking water.

'Hey' Give it a while. Lately he's been the early riser and I've been sleeping in. It was the opposite before I left. An hour goes by. I get the 'nocs out, check his boat. His dinghy's there. 'Kinda odd.' Shoot him another text.

I see my first text hasn't been delivered. ""Message will be delivered when recipient is online."" 'He must need to go get his service re-upped.' I try calling just in case. Get a message confirming his service is out.

An hour or so later I go up on the bow to get some sun and watch boats go by. I see his dinghy leave his boat and head for the dock. 'Good. He'll get that handled. I'll talk to him later.' 

Back down below. I open the entire boat up. The more I can air this thing out the better. Breakfast. Reddit. Nap. Shoot him another text, 'Hey.' 'Hey. I'm trying to fix my motor.' 'Shit. What happened?' No response. (We all remember about getting boat stuff done first, right?) No big deal.

I go up on deck with the 'nocs. Watch him fight with his motor. Leave. Come back. Fight some more. Finally I see his dinghy slip away from the dock. He's got a paddle in his hand. I had no desire to watch him paddle against the current back to his boat. I go back down below.

I checked my anchor rope earlier. The other thing I wanted to do was check my batteries. Had some lunch first. Smoke. 'Time to get it done. I'll probably pack my gear tonight so next time he can come get me I can get the fuck out of here and go work. Then we can have two dinghies fucking up all the time. üòÜ'

I disconnect my charge controller in the right order. Panels first, then battery. I grab some tools and a flashlight. Climb down into one of that lazarettes. Unhook both batteries. Pull them up on deck. Climb out of lazarette. Pop the caps. 

They're low, but the plates are still covered. 'Perfect.' I add some distilled water untill each cell is full but there's still room for venting during a stabilization charge. A few extra drops for good measure since I'm leaving soon.

Caps back on. Light cleaning of all connections. Batteries reinstalled, cables linking them to gether, power wires to inverter and charge controller hooked back up. Out of lazarette. Charge controller hooked up to batteries. Solar panels hooked to charge controller. Quick check for operation. All good.

That's all I came here for. Now I just have to wait until my friend figures out how to get us back to shore and I'll be out of here. Hopefully I don't run out of water.

>Reflecting on Lue‚Äôs ‚Äúfuture remote viewing‚Äù words, I realized precisely what I believed to have happened. Sean was passing on to Lue tidbits of personal information on me, much the same way that ‚Äúpsychics‚Äù in road shows do to their audience with the help of the TV show producers‚Ä¶ But Sean didn‚Äôt have the whole picture, so Lue didn‚Äôt have the entire picture; it all made sense. Lue saying my daughter (not my youngest, had he known I have two) but only referring to her as my daughter would go to the most prestigious university in the US showed that he had no idea I have two daughters. His comment about my ex-wife (not my first or second ex ‚Äî just my ‚Äúex-wife‚Äù) having a drug addiction problem showed me that Lue had no idea that I had been twice previously married. Again reflecting on the conversation Sean and I had on the trip up to Wyoming, I vividly recall telling Sean that my ex-wife had an ‚Äúaddictive personality.‚Äù This statement, apparently, made it to Lue, who potentially misinterpreted it to mean that my ex-wife was struggling with an addiction to drugs. When I told Sean about my ex-wife having an addictive personality, I never elaborated what that meant ‚Äî when it had absolutely¬†**NOTHING**¬†to do with drugs or alcohol. The ex-wife I was referring to is a¬†**health addict, a gym rat, a marathon runner**¬†‚Äî someone who is¬†**addicted**¬†to¬†**fitness**, and she‚Äôs also a Mormon who¬†**doesn‚Äôt even drink coffee**¬†due to the caffeine. And even if a rare instance happened when I inadvertently spoke about my first ex-wife (which I did not), she doesn‚Äôt have any addiction issues either ‚Äî she‚Äôs a¬†**Full Bird Colonel in the USAF**. But it appeared that Sean had misunderstood, combined with not knowing I was twice previously married, and told Lue that my ex had an addiction issue ‚Äî which appears to have been exploited by Lue during his ‚Äú**remote viewing of me in the future**.‚Äù It was all garbage, smoke, and mirrors, and I was pissed off. It couldn‚Äôt have been staged better unless Lue wore a turban while staring into a crystal ball.

This is just the tip of the iceberg.

[In Jesse Michael's podcast/documentary featuring Lue Elizondo](https://youtu.be/1f16VvXaSSE?si=Ijy3XsVVYNRBqSz5), at one point Elizondo (somewhat reluctantly) discusses a period of time when he was assigned working in the CIA, and assigned to Guantanamo Bay to conduct ""Psychic Espionage"".

[One of the experiences he shares with Jesse](https://youtu.be/1f16VvXaSSE?t=3489)¬†is how he and others on his team somewhat jokingly decided to try torturing high value detainees using remote viewing, which in this case seems to be via astral projection. He jokingly recounts how they made a game of astrally projecting themselves into the sleeping prisoner's cells and carried out various activities like shaking their bed, screaming at them, etc.

The second lue elizondo claimed he could remote view to torture terrorists and refused to demonstrate his ability should have been enough to disregard him.

The second he claimed green orbs came inside his house dozens of times should have been enough to disregard him as a liar.

¬†

# Part 1 - Post Corporeal Existence

¬†

The meeting room was a rectangular space, well-lit, and with a long table in the center made of light wood with dark trim. Margaret straightened the black upholstered chairs, placing one chair against the wall. She only needed seven chairs for this meeting.¬†¬†

There was a knock on the door and a slender woman with short dark hair stepped through.

‚ÄúIs this the right room?‚Äù She looks toward Margaret. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for the Validation review.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúYes, it is. I‚Äôm Margaret Wise, Assistant to the Secretary of The Sophia Foundation.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is Janice,‚Äù she offered her hand.

‚ÄúWelcome. I‚Äôm just getting the room ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan I help?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, there is a box of notepads and pencils over by the window. If you could place one at each seat.‚Äù

Two other people stood at the door: a young man and an older woman.

‚ÄúPlease, come in,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúThere is tea, coffee, and sparkling water over there.‚Äù¬† Margaret pointed to a table at the far end of the room. ¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Peter Nguyen,‚Äù replied the young man.

‚ÄúLinh Ch√©n,‚Äù offered the women. ‚ÄúAre we late?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm expecting a few more,‚Äù replied Margaret as they shook hands.

Peter went to the table and poured himself a coffee. He looked over a bookcase, lifted out one book, flipped through it, then put it back.

Linh took a seat, opening her handbag to take out a pen and notebook.

Another woman arrived. She introduced herself as [Kate Piane ]()and then went to make herself a cup of tea. ‚ÄúCan I get anyone anything?‚Äù she asks.

‚ÄúThank you, I'm fine,‚Äù replied Margaret. Peter gestured with his cup to indicate he had a coffee. Linh continued writing some notes.

A man wearing a grey suit and tie arrived.

‚ÄúReverend John,‚Äù said Margaret as she went over and hugged the new arrival.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pleased you could attend.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could I refuse a mysterious e-mail inviting me to an urgent meeting!‚Äù He smiled broadly, greeting the others.

‚ÄúHow are you; your family.‚Äù

John looked contemplative. ‚ÄúOh, the new normal.‚Äù

They stood together for a moment, then Margaret turned aside. ‚ÄúIf you could all take a seat,‚Äù

Margaret walked to the front of the table. ‚ÄúI need to explain the agenda. I apologise that I could not tell why the urgent invitation.‚Äù She took a seat and waited as the others shuffled about taking their own seats. ‚ÄúI am expecting one other, but I‚Äôd like to start.‚Äù¬†

Those at the meeting nodded in affirmation.

‚ÄúFirstly, The Sophia Foundation‚Äôs Board of Directors has a meeting tomorrow evening. For reasons I shall explain, the Secretary wants your advice on a particular matter the Board is to consider.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt to review grant applications?‚Äù asked Peter.

‚ÄúWell, a review of research,‚Äù replied Margaret as she shifted in her chair. ‚ÄúBut not assessing grant applications for the Foundation as you have previously undertaken.‚Äù ¬†She picked up a pencil twiddling it in her fingers. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll explain as best I can.‚Äù

The door opened and a man wearing a suede jacket came it. ‚ÄúSorry, I am late.‚Äù He muttered.

‚ÄúGood you could make the meeting, Lewis,‚Äù said Margaret as she half stood. ‚ÄúPlease take a seat. Perhaps we could start with introductions. I know some of you have met, but not all.¬† Lewis, if you can go first.‚Äù

‚ÄúLewis Wiseman. I‚Äôm a journalist with the Argust.‚Äù He nodded to John.‚Äù We‚Äôve been at a few of the grant application reviews.‚Äù

‚ÄúMargaret was just explaining that this isn‚Äôt about grant applications,‚Äù replied John.

‚ÄúIf we could do introductions; then I‚Äôll explain,‚Äù interjected Margaret. ‚ÄúJohn, could you go next.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy name is John Davies. I am a pastor and sometime lecturer at State University.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs next?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll go. My name is Kate Piane. I am CEO of the Womens Health Service.‚Äù She adjusted her collar.

‚ÄúKate has advised on Access and Equity issues for many years,‚Äù added Margaret.

¬†The older women look around the table. ‚ÄúI am Linh Ch√©n. I am a social worker with Child Protection Services.‚Äù ¬†

Margaret gestured toward Peter Nguyen. ‚ÄúOur youngest and a mathematician.‚Äù

‚ÄúA PhD candidate in Mathematics.‚Äù

‚ÄúPeter Nguyen,‚Äù interrupted Lewis. ‚ÄúThat is Smith in Vietnamese, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Peter lolled his eyes. ‚ÄúA common name.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe name of a revered Emperor,‚Äù added Kate.

‚ÄúMore a historical dynasty,‚Äù Peter clarified.

‚ÄúI guess I am last. My name is Janice Black. ‚ÄúI am a Theater Nurse and educator.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúJanice teaches about medical ethics, and we have been pleased she has recently been helping the Foundation,‚Äù concluded Margaret.  
  
Peter stood and went over to refill his coffee cup. ‚ÄúAnd we have been invited to this esteemed meeting for?‚Äù

‚ÄúI best tell you why we need your help. It is a bit complicated. Perhaps you might like to get a drink before I start.‚Äù

Those at the table remained seated and after a moment Margaret opened a document she had in front of her.

‚ÄúFirstly, the Secretary has asked me to stress that if you don‚Äôt wish to stay, you may leave at any time. I only ask that you treat what we discuss with confidence.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the same as with the grant application process,‚Äù mentioned Peter.

‚ÄúThis is somewhat different.‚Äù Margaret fidgeted. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôll respect the Foundations‚Äô work.‚Äù

Peter sipped his coffee.

‚ÄúI have here a research application. It is 50-years-old. Approved by a former Board of the Foundation.‚Äù Margaret took out some copies and started passing them around. It was typewritten and a tad faded in parts.

‚ÄúHalf a century‚Äù, remakes Kate as she is lifted through.  
  
‚ÄúI need to explain why we are looking at this now,‚Äù continued Margaret. ‚ÄúThe Foundation had agreed to be a party to this research. Not just to fund it. It had the right to decide if the results would be published. The research was to be undertaken over 50 years. The Foundation is to decide if they will publish the results.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy wouldn‚Äôt the results be published,‚Äù raised Peter. ‚ÄúThat is the principle of any research; to be accountable.‚Äù

¬†Margaret lifted through the pages and cited. ‚ÄúThe proposed study is to comply with the National Statement on Ethical Conducts in Human Research to include:

‚ÄòThe likely benefit of the research must justify any risks of harm or discomfort to participants.¬†

The likely benefit may be to the participants, to the wider community, or to both.‚Äô‚Äù¬†

She closed the document. ‚ÄúIf I can continue, I am sure this will become clear.‚Äù¬†

Peter nodded and sipped his coffee again.

‚ÄúAccording to the minutes of the Board that I have read over, there were two other organisations that made applications for the Foundation to contribute to some complex research. The two organisations also had contrary views on the research.‚Äù Margaret sighed.

‚ÄúThe Catholic Universities‚Äô Nursing and Health Department had published a study of Near-Death-experiences, which they purported supported their views on an after-life.‚Äù She held up her hand to dissuade Peter from interrupting. ‚ÄúThis research was interviews of 47 patients who had experienced cardiac episodes and were revived, and then asked about any experiences.‚Äù¬†

Margaret flipped through her notes. ‚ÄúThere were over 150 patients who had been revived over an 18-month period, and 47 were interviewed, or agreed to be interviewed.¬† They reported on Out-of-body experiences, Feelings of peace, Seeing a light, and meeting deceased loved ones.‚Äù

Margaret paused, then continued. ‚ÄúThere had been a public meeting to discuss this research that included the Humanist Society. They are the two parties to this research. At this ‚Äì debate -the Humanist argued that the research was semiotics in nature, and while valid about a persons‚Äô experiences, could not support a general outcome about an after-life.‚Äù

‚ÄúA post-hoc-ergo-porta-hoc-error,‚Äù injected Peter.

‚ÄúA what error?‚Äù asks John.

‚ÄúObserving something after the fact and imputing an effect,‚Äù replied Peter.

John squinted his eyes.

‚ÄúMy dog has four legs, my cat has four legs, therefore my dog is a cat,‚Äù said Janice. ‚ÄúExcept it isn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm confused,‚Äù said Kate.

‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúThe thing is the two organisations agreed that the research of cardiac patients was not compelling.‚Äù

Linh looked up from her notepad. ‚ÄúThat is interesting.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúApparently, a member of the audience asked what methodology might produce valid results. The Humanist said this would be a hypothesis that predicted a certain outcome that could be tested.¬† There had apparently been experiments involving asking revived patients if they could recall a message written out of view; on top of a cupboard in an operating theatre. This was dismissed as not showing experience after death. They settled on the idea of linking unique numbers that would produce a very-rare output ‚Äì The candidate would be asked to memorise these numbers and see if a person experiencing a near-death experience might know the sum of a number known to someone who had previously died. The two organisations agreed to work together to refine this idea; and determined it would need to be broadscale, long-term, and costly. So they approached the Foundation to provide funding, and to audit the results. This proposal is the document in front of you. I suggest you take time to read through it, and then I‚Äôll return.‚Äù

Those around the table looked from side to side; as if finally comprehending why they were there.

‚ÄúThere has been a result,‚Äù said Linh. ‚ÄúYou have recently had a result.¬† That is why you have asked us here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like you to read through the report. The Board wants advice on whether to publish or not.‚Äù Margaret gathered her documents and stood. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you read through, and I‚Äôll return shortly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am leaving,‚Äù said Lewis.

‚ÄúWhy are you leaving?‚Äù asked John.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to explain my decision.‚Äù He stood up. ‚ÄúI can leave, can‚Äôt I?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be paid for the entire day.¬† You can leave at any time.¬† Anyone, can leave if they want to.‚Äù

¬†Margaret walked with Lewis to the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be back in half an hour. The toilets are down the hallway. Call on my mobile phone if you need anything.‚Äù

The two of them left.

¬†

# Part 2 - Post Corporeal Existence

¬†

Kate flipped through the copy of the research proposal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure if I want to be involved. I don‚Äôt understand what the researchers were on about.‚Äù She stood and walked over to the coffee stand and poured a glass of water.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll need to read through the proposal,‚Äù remarked John. He lifted the report and leafed through the dozen or so pages. ‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt that long.‚Äù

Kate strolled over to Linh, who was scrawling notes as she read the report. ‚ÄúWhat do you make of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt finished reading it.‚Äù

‚ÄúPerhaps we ought all to read it through, as Margaret advised,‚Äù offered John as he made himself a coffee.

¬†‚ÄúWe can call Margaret back to ask for any clarifications,‚Äù added Janice. ‚ÄúBut I need a cup of tea.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a tea too, black,‚Äù said Kate.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be Mom,‚Äù chimed Peter.¬† He went to the table and started arranging cups, clarifying who wanted what. ‚ÄúIt is really not that complicated.‚Äù He dangled tea bags, adding milk and sugar as required. ‚ÄúThe proposal mentions the researchers felt that a sample of 10,000 would be required, to give a reasonable chance of a result, while not being too many for a catchment area. They settled on patients from the Catholic University Hospital. So only one place to look out for responses.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat responses?‚Äù asked Kate. ‚ÄúWhat are these 3-digit numbers about?‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúA number that was not too large to remember,‚Äù offered John as he lifted a page pointing to a line.

‚ÄúWhat page,‚Äù queried Janice? ‚ÄúAnd what are Triangular numbers?‚Äù

Peter went to a Whiteboard on one side of the room, wiped it clean. ‚ÄúWould you like me to explain Triangular numbers?‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù nodded Janice.

Peter looked around at the others. ‚ÄúRemember what Margaret said about patients being asked to memorise numbers? Then if a person had a near-death experience was able to express a number which was the sum of that number and another a number assigned to someone who had died.‚Äù

‚ÄúSum of,‚Äù said John.

‚ÄúAn amount from the addition of two or more numbers; addition, 1 plus 1 = 2‚Äù.

‚ÄúThank you. Mathematics was not my strong point.‚Äù

Peter grinned. ‚ÄúAnyway, they did not want just any old number as that would be unwielding. It seems they also thought Special numbers would be harder to predict at random.‚Äù Peter took up a marker and started writing. ‚ÄúA special number is something that can create an unusual result or application.‚Äù He wrote œñ (Pie).¬† ‚ÄúThis is an example - the constant of the ratio of the circumference of a circle. A prime number is another; it can only be divided by 1 or itself.‚Äù He wrote¬† 3, 5, 7, 11.

‚ÄúThe researchers settled on Triangle number. These are numbers that can be arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle when represented as dots.‚Äù He wrote it down:

T1=2(1+1)=1 ^(1)

T2=2(2+1)2=3T

T3=3(3+1)2=6T

‚ÄúI‚Äôm more confused,‚Äù whined Kate.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. It is a formula that creates a list of different numbers. There are 31 triangular numbers between 1 and 499. They assigned patients one of these numbers to remember.‚Äù

¬†Linh was circling something on her notepad. ‚ÄúWhere does 499 come from?‚Äù

Peter sipped his coffee. ‚ÄúLukewarm.‚Äù

‚ÄúWould you like me to make a fresh cup of coffee,‚Äù asked Janice.

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

Janice walked to the table.

‚ÄúI mentioned 10,000 samples. That is on page - ‚Äù. ¬†Peter picked up the report and thumped through it. ‚ÄúPage 11. But if you read on the researchers decided that was too large. It would require a 4-digit number for patients to remember. ¬†999 is the maximum number a 3-digit number allows.‚Äù

Janice held up a jug. ‚ÄúMilk?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust a little.‚Äù

‚ÄúSugar?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Janice poured from the jug.

‚ÄúThey also wanted the result to be no more than 3-digits. If the numbers are to be added to give this maximum it can be no more than 499.¬† There are 31 Triangular numbers between 1 and 499.‚Äù

Janice carried the cup to Peter and handed it to him.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúPleasure.‚Äù

‚ÄúFinally, the researchers wanted to exclude numbers less than 100 as they would have zeros in front of them, such as zero-five-four, or zero-zero-three. They felt zeros would add undue confusion. This left 18 Triangle numbers between 100 and 499.‚Äù¬†

Peter lifted his cup and sipped

Linh looked up, then down at her notes, and up again. ‚ÄúI understand.¬† It does not matter how the numbers were created; just that there were a series of unique numbers.‚Äù

‚ÄúEssentially‚Äù, responded Peter.

‚ÄúI am more interested in the use of the numbers‚Äù, offered Linh. ‚ÄúThe proposal says the candidates were to be selected from patients of the Catholic University Hospital. Over a period of 4 weeks, patients aged between 18 and 65 would be assigned numbers. The numbers would be added to their existing patient number, with an explanation that it was an identifier for a blood test.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere are you reading,‚Äù inquired Janice now standing near the window holding the report in her hands.

‚ÄúAppendix C, page 23.‚Äù

Janice leafed through the report.

‚ÄúYou said they had a result,‚Äù interjected John. ‚ÄúOught we talk about that?‚Äù

¬†Linh ran her hand through her short hair. ‚ÄúI deduced there has been a result. ‚Äù She rested her chin on her hand.

‚ÄòI believe we need to work through the report, so we can understand any result,‚Äù offered Peter.

‚ÄúI want to go home,‚Äù said Kate.

‚ÄúPlease stay,‚Äù replied Janice. ‚ÄúWe need your help. This is important.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said ‚ÄòI wanted to go home‚Äô but I am staying. I don‚Äôt feel it fair to leave this problem to a few. Lewis should have stayed. I‚Äôm annoyed at him.‚Äù ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúIf I might continue,‚Äù proffered Linh.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù said Peter.

Linh, turned over her own notes. ‚ÄúIt says the study was to be incorporated in unrelated medical research. A study of liver disease to develop a diagnostic test for Hepatitis B.¬† The scientist involved in that study would be unaware of the secondary purpose. The idea was that the candidates would observe this 3-digit identifier without being aware of its other purpose.‚Äù

John looked up. ‚ÄúWhat about the issue of consent and ethics for this secondary study?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt says that the patient would consent to the blood sample,‚Äù answered Linh.

‚ÄúYou have to remember that practices and ideas about informed consent were different in those days,‚Äù offered Janice.  
  
‚ÄúThey did not care about up-turning folks' entire Religious and spiritual views,‚Äù interjected John.¬†

‚ÄúThe candidates were expected to be dead,‚Äù snickered Peter.

‚ÄúThe 50-year time frame was selected as actuarially the patients were expected to have died,‚Äù said Linh. ‚ÄúA database of who had been assigned which number ‚Äì the numbers would be used more than once ‚Äì would be kept by the Foundation.‚Äù She turned back a few pages in the report. ¬†‚ÄúThere is consideration as to extracting the results.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúExtracting what? Blood samples!‚Äù John

‚ÄúRemembrance; of the numbers. Rather the sum of two numbers as Peter described. Any patient who experienced a serious medical episode ‚Äì the researchers are clear about using that term as opposed to Near-Death-Experience, which is not a scientific concept.¬† A patient expressing a 3-digit number would be checked against the list of candidates at the Foundation; to see if they were valid.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what perplexes me,‚Äù said Janice. ‚ÄúWho at a hospital collects random remarks of patients who are likely to be *not fully there*. ¬†Who do they advise? How does this information get to the Foundation?‚Äù

Linh turned over her notes. ‚ÄúThis was clearly an issue for the researchers. The protocol was that three people at the Hospital were to be aware of the secondary purpose of the numbers; The CEO, the senior medical registrar, and the Director of Nursing. They were to advise hospital staff under some pretext to note any expression of 3-digit numbers. The researchers acknowledged this was unusual, but did not feel there was any better option. I guess it was no stranger than asking patients about lights-at-end-of-tunnel, meeting great aunt Maud, and what other studies were doing. They were trying to improve the methodology. They state in the conclusion it was not perfect; and that over the half-century time-frame, people might just not bother, thinking it all pointless.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpending a lot of time and money on silly research,‚Äù interjected Peter.

‚ÄúThe result would be considered positive if a number offered by a patient, when subtracted from the number they had been assigned previously, matched the number assigned to another now deceased patient.‚Äù Linh.

‚ÄúPerhaps we ought to ask Margaret back,‚Äù said Kate. ‚ÄúShe may have some thoughts.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt sounds quite spurious,‚Äù said John.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôd also like something to eat. Let's get Margaret.‚Äù

‚ÄúAs spurious as Talking snakes, virgin births, and zombies,‚Äù quirked Peter.

‚ÄúLunch time, then,‚Äù said Kate. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll get Margaret‚Äù.  


# Part 3 - Post Corporeal Existence

¬†

‚ÄúI brought a range of items for lunch,‚Äù offered Margaret as she came into the room holding a tray, covered in plastic wrap, along with a bottle of fruit juice. ‚ÄúThere is Ham and Cheese wraps, Rice- Paper-Rolls ‚Ä¶‚Äù She laid the tray down and pulled off the plastic wrapping.

‚ÄúVegan?‚Äù asks Kate.

‚ÄúSome of the Rice Paper Rolls are vegetable, and I think this is a quinoa salad,‚Äù she said as she uncovered a bean mix; then proceeded to place out paper plates and cutlery.

Kate came over, poked at the salad, and then laddered some onto her plate

‚ÄúThere is a selection of pastries.‚Äù Margaret.

Peter hopped off a bench on which he was leaning and went to the array of lunch.

¬†‚ÄúThe toilet is down the hallway?‚Äù asked Janice.

‚ÄúTo the left, two doors down.‚Äù Margaret.

‚ÄúI need to go too,‚Äù announced John. ‚ÄúLeave some pastries for me, Peter.‚Äù

Peter smirked as he continued filling his plate.

Linh remained sitting. ‚ÄúThe results of the study‚Äô what were they?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf we can wait till everyone has gotten something to eat. Then I‚Äôll go over the information that I have.‚Äù Margaret placed a few things on a plate and poured herself a fruit juice.

‚ÄúHow long have you been Assistant Secretary,‚Äù asked Peter as he sat down with his plate.

‚ÄúI am assistant to the Secretary; not quite as grand.‚Äù She sat next to Peter.

‚ÄúStill, that must be fascinating; issues of cosmology, biology, consciousness, and the nature of reality, ethics, and meeting eminent Business Leaders, academics, and public figures.‚Äù

‚ÄúI met Professor Frank Wilcocks last year. He was enthralling. He listened to you ‚Äì I felt valued, not just responded to.‚Äù

‚ÄúNobel laureate. I wish I could have been there. I find the connection between quarks and gluons fascinating.‚Äù Peter.

Margaret sipped her drink. ‚ÄúHe mentioned that briefly, but mostly spoke about his religious feelings, Catholicism, and how it influenced his growth and development.‚Äù¬†

John returned. ‚ÄúWho was talking about Catholicism? Did that come up in the study?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were talking about Professor Wilcocks,‚Äù mentioned Peter.

‚ÄúProfessor who?‚Äù retorted John.

‚ÄúIf we might continue,‚Äù intruded Margaret. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt mind eating while I speak.‚Äù

‚ÄúJanice isn‚Äôt back,‚Äù said Kate.

‚ÄúLet me fill my coffee cup.‚Äù Peter.¬†

‚ÄúI want to hear,‚Äù said John and took another mouthful.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúAnyone else needs to use the toilets before I start?‚Äù ¬†

They moved around the table, taking seats. Then Janice came back and sat. She ignored her plate.  
  
¬†Margaret smoothed her skirt and looked at her notes. ‚ÄúAs I mentioned, the research required collecting and checking any 3-digit expressions made by patients who had *Return of Spontaneous Circulation*. That is the medical term used.‚Äù Margaret looked at Janice.

‚ÄúThat is correct; perhaps post-arrest or Post-Resuscitation.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù Margaret smoothed her dress again. ‚ÄúThere were a few occurrences; twelve in total, where hospital staff documented 3-digit expressions. Most were in the initial decade; and two about 20 years ago. None met the studies criteria.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúThe numbers, when subtracted from the number originally assigned to the person did not match any number of a deceased patient,‚Äù clarified Peter.

Margaret nodded. ¬†¬†

‚ÄúI wonder if lack of interest by hospital staff, influenced the decline in records.‚Äù Kate¬†

Linh moved about collecting the paper plates and putting them in the rubbish bin.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt see nurses paying much attention to a procedure that they had no understanding of the purpose,‚Äù added Janice. ‚ÄúEven if they had known the purpose, nurses have much to do for the living without concern for the long dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was a result,‚Äù John stood. ‚ÄúWhat was it?‚Äù

¬†Margaret sighed. ‚ÄúFour weeks ago; just after the last Board meeting, the current Hospital CEO sent an email. He said he was following protocol in contacting the Foundation. It took some time for the Secretary to be advised. I didn‚Äôt know anything about the Study; it seems no one else did.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut what was the result.‚Äù John stepped toward Margaret.

Margaret read slowly and clearly. ‚Äú""Upon experiencing a cardiac arrest, the patient, once resuscitated, verbally communicated a sequence of six numerals, which he reiterated five times as reported by the attending nursing staff. Subsequently, the patient suffered another cardiac arrest, and despite resuscitative efforts, could not be revived.""‚Äù¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúSix numbers. No result then?‚Äù stated Peter.

John remained standing glaring at Margaret.  
  
‚ÄúThe number was comprised of 3 digits, repeated twice. The 3-digits were checked against the data-base and when subtracted, matched a number of a former patients at the Hospital, now deceased.‚Äù Margaret looked directly at John. ‚ÄúThis circumstance is not covered by the research protocol.¬† Nothing about sequences of numbers.¬† The Secretary determined this was a negative result, and so intends to advise the Board.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is not a negative result,‚Äù exclaimed John. ‚ÄúIt is just the number repeated twice.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is what you may conclude,‚Äù said Margaret from her seat¬†

John turned about and returned to his own seat ¬†

‚ÄúThe researcher must have considered that seriously ill patients might quickly die,‚Äù mentioned Janice, ‚ÄúNothing in the proposal about interviewing patients about what they may have meant.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are we here then?‚Äù asked Kate.

Peter smiled. ‚ÄúBecause others will learn of the result. The Catholic University, the Humanist ‚Äì the protocol says they must be advised. They‚Äôll make statements. Contradictory statements to be sure. If the Foundation says nothing, it will appear foolish.‚Äù

‚ÄúFoolish for agreeing to the research, in the first place.‚Äù Linh.

‚ÄúWe are the public relations cover.‚Äù Peter.¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúThe Board can announce what it chooses; say it has consulted; followed procedures; looks much better than anyone else‚Äô assertions.‚Äù Kate stood up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any need to discuss this further. This is the Board‚Äôs problem. I suggest we leave them to it.‚Äù She gathered her handbag and looked about. Then, walked to the door, opened it, and left¬†

¬†‚ÄúYou are free to leave if you choose.‚Äù Margaret.

The remainder looked at each other as they sat around the table.

¬†

# Part 4 - Post Corporeal Existence

¬†

‚ÄúThe result is important; a message from the dead,‚Äù stated John. ‚ÄúThat must be published.‚Äù¬†

Janice looked toward Margaret. ‚ÄúWhat will be published?‚Äù

‚ÄúAs I previously said, the Secretary is to advise that the research failed to meet its objectives; and in hindsight could not have.‚Äù Margaret leaned forward, ‚ÄúHowever, the Secretary wanted further advise, considering the significant funding devoted to this research.‚Äù

¬†‚ÄúThere was a result; it wasn‚Äôt a failure.‚Äù John.¬†

‚ÄúWhat could we possibly add,‚Äù said Janice ignoring John.

‚ÄúWe can say there was a message!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is ambivalent as best,‚Äù argued Janice.  
  
‚ÄúIf we could address the concern that had you invited.‚Äù Margaret.¬†

‚ÄúWhat else ‚Ä¶‚Äù John began to spatter before Peter sounded Ahem-hem over him.

‚ÄúThe issue of the Foundation's reputation,‚Äù inserted Peter. ‚ÄúWhen the results are published; which they must be as the Foundation does not control what the Catholic University or Humanist Society may say.‚Äù He tilted his head.¬† ‚ÄúThe Foundation is a lauded body for supporting research, it has associations with a wide range of folk; professors, Bishops, Business, and Politicians. It receives considerable donations toward its work.‚Äù Peter looked directly at the others. ‚ÄúDo we want to see the Foundation continue its work?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy is that a concern!‚Äù John.

‚ÄúIt may not be,‚Äù continued Peter. ‚ÄúI am merely saying this is what we were invited to consider.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe Foundation has been around for generations,‚Äù said Janice. ‚ÄúWhat does this matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI guess the Secretary feels it might,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúHe wanted your advice as to how this research might be best dealt with.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf the Foundation asserted it was bogus, there would be acquisitions of covering up. If it says it is plausible the practices of the Foundation will be critiqued.‚Äù¬† Peter lifted his cup, seeing it empty, placed it down again. ‚ÄúQuite a quandary.¬†

John cupped his hands together on his mouth, leaning forward.

Peter tilted his head, tapping his fingers.

Linh leafed through her notes.

‚ÄúCan we offer our own personal views?‚Äù asked Janice, as she rolled some anti-bacteria gel through her hands.¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be unanimous,‚Äù answered Margaret. She waited with hands resting on the table¬†

Johns‚Äô mobile phone rang. He picked it up and stifled the ring.

‚ÄúI have a thought,‚Äù offered Peter.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to hear your thoughts.‚Äù Janice.

The others nodded to indicate affirmation.¬†

‚ÄúThe result is interesting, but inconclusive. I feel the researchers exaggerated the statistical unlikeliness of their methodology.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù asked Janice.

‚ÄúThe researchers assumed the chance of matches of any Triangle number to be quite small, whereas there is a good chance of numbers adding up, or this case, subtracting.‚Äù¬† Peter went to the whiteboard and wiped off his earlier work. ‚ÄúThe assessment was based on a Bayesian test of probability on an event.‚Äù

He wrote ‚ÄúX = match‚Äù.

Then ‚ÄúX = a x b x c x d x e x f‚Äù

‚ÄúIf ‚Äòa‚Äô is the chance of any two patients being in hospital at the time numbers were assigned; we could assign 0.5 or fifty-fifty, for the sake of argument.¬† Then ‚Äòb‚Äô is the chance of one of these two dying and being revived; again we assume fifty-fifty, ‚Äòc‚Äô is the chance of the person expressing a 3-digit number, which is also fifty-fifty, ‚Äòd‚Äô a nurse writing down this number,¬† and ‚Äòe‚Äô the number being passed on to the Foundation, and ‚Äòf‚Äô a match.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you assuming fifty-fifty for these odds?‚Äù raised John as he lent back. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt possibly know if it might be one in two, one in a thousand, or anything.‚Äù

Peter paused and clasped one hand over the other which was holding the Marker.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following,‚Äù added Janice shaking her head.

‚ÄúThe ratios don‚Äôt matter. I am just imputing them to demonstrate how the researchers calculated the probability. They did not know either. If you look at page 25, last paragraph they explained their methodology.‚Äù

Janice turned over the pages and looked down.¬†

‚ÄúCan I continue‚Äù Peter.

No one said anything.

Peter wrote 1√ó(0.5) ^(6)¬†¬†¬† \[one multiplied by 0.5 to the power of 6\]

‚ÄúI thus have a calculation of one multiplied by point-5 which equals 0.25; multiplying this result again by point-5 the answer is 0.0125; and if I keep multiplying the result by point-5.‚Äù Peter wrote out the figures as he spoke. ‚Äúand again, and again ‚Äì 6 times in total.‚Äù He stopped for a moment. ‚ÄúThe answer is ¬†0.015625 or 1.5%.‚Äù He walked back to his seat. ‚ÄúThe researchers took what they felt as the conservative assumption of fifty-fifty, so thought that the odds of any number being obtained at random as 1.5%. Then with the results needing to be a Triangular between 1 and 500, they further compounded this by 31. If you look at the second last line, the researchers offer that as this was a conservative assumption; that is, what is the likelihood of a nurse decades later seeing any significance in a random expression by a patient ‚Äì they suggested a number coming up by chance was thousands, millions.‚Äù Peter sat down¬†

¬†‚ÄúI‚Äôm more confused,‚Äù stressed Janice.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry,‚Äù replied Peter. ‚ÄúThe only thing we might observe is the researchers were really bad at statistics. The research was actually around the chance occurrence of 13 numbers: the number of Triangle numbers between 100 and 499.¬† A single event. The odds are one in thirteen. Not likely but possible.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the research project was bollocks from the start.‚Äù Margaret¬†

¬†‚ÄúPretty much so.‚Äù Peter¬†

‚ÄúAnd you had observed this from the beginning,‚Äù stated Linh. She folded her notebook. ‚ÄúYou might have mentioned this sooner.‚Äù

Peter chortled. ‚ÄúI thought there was going to be a video recording of a poltergeist, ghostwriting or the resurrection.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being Blasphemous,‚Äù asserted John.  
  
‚ÄúI apologise, John.‚Äù Peter clasps his hands together in a mocking gesture. ‚ÄúI was more quiring what sort of evidence would demonstrate ‚ÄòPost Corporeal Existence‚Äô or the oxymoronic ‚Äòlife after death.‚Äô

John glower.

‚ÄúBut you already have evidence in your sacred script.‚Äù ¬†Peter.

‚ÄúI appreciate if you could focus on the issue at hand,‚Äù interposed Margaret.

‚ÄúBoys,‚Äù smirked Janice.

‚ÄúI read a novel by Robert Harris,‚Äù began Linh. ‚ÄúThe main character said the sin he feared most was certainty. If there was only certainty, and if there was no doubt, there would be no mystery, and therefore no need for faith.‚Äù ^(2)

‚ÄúMysticism compared to science,‚Äù said Peter. ‚ÄúTwo different magisterial. And that is what we have here?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I could propose that we determine what we can advise the Board, if anything.‚Äù Margaret.

‚ÄúWhat can we say other than the research is inconclusive.‚Äù offered Janice.

‚ÄúCould any such research produce compelling evidence?‚Äù continued Magaret before anyone else could speak.

‚ÄúThere were 3-digits that match; merely repeated for clarity.‚Äù John.¬†

‚ÄúPeter said this might have been by chance.‚Äù Janice.

‚ÄúAnd it may not; another study might provide more responses.‚Äù John

‚ÄúThe Board is not going to approve another research project,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúThey are clear they would not have funded this research if given a choice. They feel this research erodes the public trust of institutions, with scant prospect of advancing knowledge, and diversion of funds from¬†¬† productive endeavors.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúDemonstrating a power beyond own; that we may aspire to be supremely contentment regardless of flaws of the World.‚Äù John held his open hands in front of him. ‚ÄúThat is certainly a laudable advancement knowledge regardless of the cost.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut, Peter, has advised that the research is flawed; well from a mathematical point of view.‚Äù Janice.

‚ÄúWe really need to be winding up,‚Äù said Margaret. ‚ÄúI have to help prepare for the Board meeting, including any advice you may offer.‚Äù

Peter leaned to one side while doodling on a piece of paper. ‚ÄúI said the methodology was unsound. I didn‚Äôt say there wasn‚Äôt a viable mathematical construct.

The others looked toward Peter.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why the researchers chose Triangle Numbers. They are not that rare, and are predictable. Perhaps, they looked tidier or easier for the researchers to understand.‚Äù¬†¬† He continued doodling. ‚ÄúI still cannot see why anyone would bother;¬† what does it matter.‚Äù

‚ÄúGod matters,‚Äù declared John.¬†¬†

‚ÄúTo you, to religious adherents for sure.‚Äù Peter glances at John. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôll believe regardless of any proof. Faith, and all.‚Äù He looked around at those at the table. ‚ÄúBut most of us are indifferent to the god/not god thing. It matters little how we live, thrive, and survive.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow would you set up research, Peter?‚Äù asked Janice.

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù injects Linh. ‚ÄúPeter might not want to say.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt alright. I suggest other special numbers that are rarer. Amicable Numbers, Perfect Numbers.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is a Perfect Number.‚Äù Janice.

‚ÄúA perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors, except itself:

6, 28, 496, 8128.¬† The chance of such in a set is very rare.‚Äù¬† Peter tapped his pencil. ‚ÄúThe reliance on ill folk being revived still seems odd. Is there any reason a message from beyond can‚Äôt be received in any other way; s√©ance, deaf-mute speaking, signs written in sand?¬† But this is wishful thinking; nothing to do with science.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCan you suggest a proper method of receiving messages?‚Äù Janice.

‚ÄúThe resurrection of a dead person.‚Äù¬† Peter stood up. ‚ÄúI have to go; work to do.‚Äù

John shook his head.

Peter walked over to John and placed his hand on John‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúThat didn't work out for Lazarus; Thomas still doubted.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI feel empty,‚Äù said Janice with a forlorn look. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to talk with my mother again.‚Äù¬†

Peter turned toward the others. ‚ÄúI wish I could talk to my sister. She teased me when we were young, but looked after me, prepared dinner when mum was late. I miss her.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe all miss someone,‚Äù offered John as stood up. ‚ÄúThank you for your input, Peter.‚Äù He picked up a copy of the report, then placed it down again. ‚ÄúI know a bit more about mathematics.‚Äù

John took Peter‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Ok.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis has been fascinating,‚Äù said Linh. ‚ÄúI hope I met you all again.‚Äù She picked up her notes, shuffled them so they were even and put them in her handbag.¬†

‚ÄúI guess I need to go too.‚Äù Janice stood up.

‚ÄúThank you for your attendance.‚Äù Margaret.

>Reflecting on Lue‚Äôs ‚Äúfuture remote viewing‚Äù words, I realized precisely what I believed to have happened. Sean was passing on to Lue tidbits of personal information on me, much the same way that ‚Äúpsychics‚Äù in road shows do to their audience with the help of the TV show producers‚Ä¶ But Sean didn‚Äôt have the whole picture, so Lue didn‚Äôt have the entire picture; it all made sense. Lue saying my daughter (not my youngest, had he known I have two) but only referring to her as my daughter would go to the most prestigious university in the US showed that he had no idea I have two daughters. His comment about my ex-wife (not my first or second ex ‚Äî just my ‚Äúex-wife‚Äù) having a drug addiction problem showed me that Lue had no idea that I had been twice previously married. Again reflecting on the conversation Sean and I had on the trip up to Wyoming, I vividly recall telling Sean that my ex-wife had an ‚Äúaddictive personality.‚Äù This statement, apparently, made it to Lue, who potentially misinterpreted it to mean that my ex-wife was struggling with an addiction to drugs. When I told Sean about my ex-wife having an addictive personality, I never elaborated what that meant ‚Äî when it had absolutely¬†**NOTHING**¬†to do with drugs or alcohol. The ex-wife I was referring to is a¬†**health addict, a gym rat, a marathon runner**¬†‚Äî someone who is¬†**addicted**¬†to¬†**fitness**, and she‚Äôs also a Mormon who¬†**doesn‚Äôt even drink coffee**¬†due to the caffeine. And even if a rare instance happened when I inadvertently spoke about my first ex-wife (which I did not), she doesn‚Äôt have any addiction issues either ‚Äî she‚Äôs a¬†**Full Bird Colonel in the USAF**. But it appeared that Sean had misunderstood, combined with not knowing I was twice previously married, and told Lue that my ex had an addiction issue ‚Äî which appears to have been exploited by Lue during his ‚Äú**remote viewing of me in the future**.‚Äù It was all garbage, smoke, and mirrors, and I was pissed off. It couldn‚Äôt have been staged better unless Lue wore a turban while staring into a crystal ball.

This is just the tip of the iceberg.

[In Jesse Michael's podcast/documentary featuring Lue Elizondo](https://youtu.be/1f16VvXaSSE?si=Ijy3XsVVYNRBqSz5), at one point Elizondo (somewhat reluctantly) discusses a period of time when he was assigned working in the CIA, and assigned to Guantanamo Bay to conduct ""Psychic Espionage"".

[One of the experiences he shares with Jesse](https://youtu.be/1f16VvXaSSE?t=3489)¬†is how he and others on his team somewhat jokingly decided to try torturing high value detainees using remote viewing, which in this case seems to be via astral projection. He jokingly recounts how they made a game of astrally projecting themselves into the sleeping prisoner's cells and carried out various activities like shaking their bed, screaming at them, etc.

The second lue elizondo claimed he could remote view to torture terrorists and refused to demonstrate his ability should have been enough to disregard him.

The second he claimed green orbs came inside his house dozens of times should have been enough to disregard him as a liar.

Hey, I‚Äôm an INTJ, and it would be ridiculously easy for me to fake being unbothered‚Äîthrow out some clich√© lines about intelligence, wisdom, and not caring what people think. But the truth is, when you‚Äôre stuck in an office for six years with people who are nothing like you, who avoid you, and who see you as some emotionless, untouchable entity, it gets suffocating.

I have a naturally sarcastic, sharp sense of humor‚Äîcreative, even‚Äîbut most people around me don‚Äôt get it, let alone appreciate it. The majority are shallow, trivial, and interested in things that feel mind-numbingly stupid to me. I‚Äôve tried to adapt since I spend ten hours a day at work, but it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre speaking entirely different languages. I stay busy with my job, but in the rare moments I take a break, grab a coffee, and hope for a decent conversation, there‚Äôs nothing.

Meanwhile, there‚Äôs this incompetent woman, far less capable than me in both intelligence and skills, who thrives purely on excessive giggling and playing cute. She‚Äôs actively tried (and succeeded) in ruining my reputation. People avoid me, and I can‚Äôt even ask why because they‚Äôd just gaslight me with, ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs nothing wrong.‚Äù And that‚Äôs just not who I am.

I don‚Äôt need the usual ‚Äústay strong, don‚Äôt care‚Äù pep talk. I need a logical, no-BS perspective on this.",13,1738538318.0,intj,37,0.88,False

i wish i never had to experience what this man decided to put me through specifically at the end. really scary fellow with bad intentions, and admits to doing evil things since he was a kid too apparently.

I always dreamed of becoming a teacher. The type of teacher who decorate‚Äôs their classroom in hope to brighten everyone‚Äôs day. Especially during the holidays. I‚Äôd go all out, not caring about the cost or how long it took to finish. Seeing their little faces light up as they walk in. I‚Äôd be worth it. I want, no‚Ä¶ I need to become my student's favorite teacher. A teacher that they will never forget. Whenever my name is mentioned, a memory of me would crawl out of a hidden corner of their mind and brighten their day. That‚Äôs the dream. 
But life has a way of forcing you down, keeping you from your goals. After college it was damn near impossible finding an elementary school position. The excuses they gave where, ‚ÄúThe school funding is being cut, lack of students in the community‚Äù. Or worst of all the lack of teachers refusing to retire. Refusing to pass the torch to that new generation. These old incompetent, waste of human space refusing retirement, makes my blood boil. They‚Äôd rather keep their cushy positions, causing the children to suffer from their lack of nuance and 50-year-old lesson plans they reuse decades after decades! These senile wrinkled flesh bags should be thrown out! Sorry I get a bit huffy over things I have a passion of. 
 But I shouldn‚Äôt get upset because I, Victoria Fe Hancock has some amazing news! I was finally offered a teaching position! Know that I have a chance to make my dream come true, I will do whatever it takes to achieve it, even if it kills me.
2. 
	‚ÄúHello?‚Ä¶ miss Hancock.. anyone there?‚Äù A young man questioning the dead air of the phone call, only hearing deep shallow breathing.
‚ÄúYES! Yes, i‚Äôll take it!‚Äù My cell phone shakes in my and slides as I struggle to hold it.
‚ÄúOh.. umm ... perfect. Well like I said... it‚Äôs an Elementary school called ValleyHaven... in ValleyHaven Pennsylvania.‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôd don‚Äôt know how‚Äôs many times you need me to agree with you Mr. Phone man, but I already said yes.‚Äù My frustration rises.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, yes I understand that... I‚Äôm just giving you the information that my boss told me to give you.‚Äù
I hold in my breathe and excitement.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶. Ple ‚Ä¶ please go on...‚Äù Phone shakes as palm sweet makes it even harder to hold up th phone.
I quietly holding down my shaky knees as I pay close attention to the recruiter. 
 ‚ÄúMs. Hancock are you still there?‚Äù
‚Äú‚Ä¶yes...‚Äù
‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ I have one more request from the school's principal.‚Äù I sit up and continue to listen.
‚ÄúIs it possible to be there Monday morning-?‚Äù
‚Äú. yes.‚Äù
 ‚Äú-uh 1hr early to meet the principal before class? I understand you live 4 states away and this is last min-‚Äù  cutting him off one last time.
 ‚ÄúMr. Recruiter... you need not to worry, daddy always said. ‚ÄúOn the path to your salvation, do what must be done‚Äù‚Ä¶ I will be there... besides, I‚Äôm currently living in my car, so packing is literally already done!‚Äù I said my thank and hung up on him. 
That Friday night I drove 13.25hrs to ValleyHaven.
Not sleeping a wink! Just gas, potty, and coffee. Just what daddy taught me.
I arrived there at 7:45am.
From what seemed to be hours surrounded by trees and dirt paths. Twisting and curving. It finally showed itself. ValleyHaven, it was everything I could‚Äôve dreamed it to be. The smell of cedar and sulfur filling the air, I‚Äôm  in heaven.
I had pulled out all my money found the local motel inn  and rented my room for the month. That‚Äôs all I could afford. Daddy says I could always make a lil extra cash the next town over, plus I remember seeing a plasma center also.
I spent the weekend getting my lesson plans ready and exploring the town. Daddy told me not to wonder off too far but, he was just being an overbearing bear.
It‚Äôs Sunday afternoon now, 
I freaken love this town. It‚Äôs the kind of place where everyone smiles at you! When walking into stores you will always hear a 
‚ÄúHello friend!‚Äù 
You literally can‚Äôt walk down the street without someone stopping you to say 
‚Äúhi‚Äù or a 
‚ÄúHow do you do?‚Äù I‚Äôve talked to almost everyone in town. And the best part, they actually listen to me and we have a real conversation! I never had siblings or friends, kids mostly ignored me. It didn‚Äôt change the older I got, I was lonely. The only friend I have, is a brown/red teddy bear that I found outside my window.
The next morning I overslept! I rushed around putting on my clothes doing my hair and makeup, skipping a shower so the smell of mildew from the room will be joining me in school today. If it wasn‚Äôt for Daddy waking me up I would‚Äôve been late. I looked down at the cute little bear staring at me with black moistened eyes. 
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only one I can ever count on‚Äù I give daddy a tight squeeze.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but today I can‚Äôt bring you, It‚Äôs my-‚Äù
‚ÄúOf course-‚Äú
‚ÄúI know if it wasn‚Äôt for you, I wouldn‚Äôt be her-‚Äù
 ‚Äú..Ok‚Ä¶Well what the heck.‚Äù I let him win this time. Grabbing him up with both my arms. I kiss his little rough nose and shove him inside my backpack. Turning to taking last minute a look around, I head out the door.


3.
	The school was hidden away outside of town, one road that takes you inside he thick forest. I was forced to turn on my headlights. After a short while, I drove out of the forest. My jaw dropped as I took in the view. The building was less of a school and more of an Cathedral church.A massive bronze bell was placed hanging over the entrance. With some sections taller than others, with the highest point in the middle. The school had carvings in every corner. Some depicting stoned children playing hide n seek. Closer I look. The children weren‚Äôt hiding, they were chasing... who are they chasing? A bronze statue of a cross with a naked woman hugging it form behind caught my eye.
I must‚Äôve been tired because from down here the bronzed woman seemed to move.
 Heavy wooden doors open.
A middle-aged man with peppered beard made his way towards me.
 ‚ÄúMiss. Hancock?‚Äù. As he approached, I noticed on his toe the cross and woman symbol sewed on it.
‚ÄúCall me Victoria, Vicky for short.‚Äù I reach out shaking his hand with both my hands in excitement. 
‚ÄúWelcome, I hope finding the academy wasn‚Äôt a trouble? I‚Äôm Mikeal, the Principal‚Ä¶ May I show you around.‚Äù I follow him as we make our way through the massive doors.
	As he showed me around, I felt underwhelmed, the outside was a lot more appealing.
 It was just a typical school hallway,
White paint with a shade of yellow dripping from every corner. The classrooms had the bare minimum decoration, just crosses and more of the stone children, except they were more detailed. The teachers were lifeless husks moving seats and tables.
‚ÄúSo much work‚Äù I muttered, Mikeal continued giving a brief history of the school, I ignored, my mind already knew what to do.
A quiet whisper crawled to my ear. As I agreed with him.
‚ÄúYes Daddy‚Ä¶ I will.‚Äù
4.
5 mins till class begins and no one has entered‚Ä¶
I got up form my seat mind racing, what should I do, what would ‚Ä¶
I notice the white board didn‚Äôt have my name or anything. So, I rush and write down my name. 
Maybe what is expect of them?
No no, it‚Äôll make me seem demanding.
Decorate it! I grabbed the varied colors and try to draw a smiling sun, clouds, motivational quotes daddy told me... 
A Deep bell flooded the hallways and room. 
Am I in the wrong class, placing the dry erasers down. I turn to grab my chair.
My students where here. 
Twenty-four children. All seated. All watching me.
Their faces were still, eyes wide and alert, like they were waiting for something.
I swallowed hard and forced a smile.
 ‚ÄúGood morning, class. My name is Miss Hancock. I will be your new teacher.‚Äù
For a moment, silence stretched between us like a taut string.
Then, as if on cue, every single child smiled.
One girl with black hair seated near the front, stood up. 
‚ÄúHello Miss Hancock, we‚Äôve been waiting for you.‚Äù
The hairs on my arms prickled in excitement.
I look down at my bag, but daddy didn‚Äôt say a word.
‚ÄúLet‚Äôs, uh, get started,‚Äù I said, clearing my throat.
And just like that, the class began.
I had every child stand up and tell me 
1-Their name
2- Interesting fact about them
3- what makes them happy
They all gave topical answers, good drawers, they can dance, this one boy made me laugh when he said he can eat a whole horse, and if he‚Äôs really hungry the man on top of it. It wasn‚Äôt my type of comedy, but I still forced a laugh joining my students.
They were perfect.
They followed every instruction without hesitation. 
Even tho they did whisper a lot, Sarah helped me keep them in line, that‚Äôs the girl who stood up in the beginning of class.
 No fidgeting. No interruptions. 
Their handwriting was acceptable.
They all worked hard.
 After the first day I tried to give everyone a high five, trying not to step over boundaries. But instead, they all hugged me, at the end the only one left was Sarah.
‚ÄúEverything alright sweetheart?‚Äù
She got up and walked straight up too me.
‚ÄúPlease stay‚Äù before I could say anything she hugged me tight. I hugged her back,
‚ÄúI promise.‚Äù

	The next few days were fantastic, the class and I were clicking.
I also found out that I wasn‚Äôt the only new teacher. There was about 5 of us, not including the 2 new janitors and 1 P.E. Coach. The school was from 1st grade to 8th grade. After, I was told the children would be bused to other schools near our area. I didn‚Äôt understand the reasoning for that, the school was big enough to have the kids all the way up until high school. Daddy told me I should worry about it. I ask him why he doesn‚Äôt speak to me at school. He says he‚Äôs sleeping; I don‚Äôt believe him. 
Today was an eventful day. Daniel accidentally bites the P.E. Coach Mr. Richardson. 
Richardson overreacted and sent Daniel to the nurse's office with a broken nose, well that‚Äôs what Sarah had told me before taking the class too church studies.
Church studies is about 2hrs and after they have an hour for lunch. So, I had about 3 hours free until the children came back to class. I decided to check on Daniel.
As I was passing by the different classes, I‚Äôd glance in and see that the children would stop what they were doing and follow me with their eyes. Ignoring them, I turned left at the end of the hall to the nurse's office. Two white doors with a stained mirror reading Nurse. Blood smired the handle.
How hurt was he? I quickened my steps worried for Daniel.
Pushing the door open I walk in.
‚ÄúDaniel!?
My eyes meet a short heavy-set nurse in a typical nurse's outfit.
Hovering over a scrawny 10year old boy, attapting to push his nose.
‚ÄúHi, miss Hancock‚Äù Daniel answered with a blood-filled nose.
‚ÄúHow you feeling?‚Äù
The nurse bonks Daniel in the head and looks at me. I‚Äôm trying to reposition his nose, can you 2 wait till I‚Äôm done.
‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù We both answer.
‚ÄúAlright now‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt move ok, on the count of 3‚Äù 
‚ÄúPop‚Äù a loud bone popping back into place filled the room.
I cover my mouth. 
‚ÄúHe broke your nose! What kind of a monster breaks a 10-year-old nose?‚Äù 
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean to bite him... I was just h...‚Äù I hold his head and rub his shoulder 
‚ÄúI know sweetie its gonna be ok, he‚Äôs not coming back, I bet you he‚Äôs getting fired.‚Äù
The new nurse cleaning the area up and grabbing the trash can.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame him, if you would‚Äôve taken a chunk out of me like that, I wouldve done the same.‚Äù She lifted the small metal trash can to show me. A bloody mouth sized chunck of human meat.
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean too... I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù Daniel pulling me to him faster then I could react. 
The nurse staying as far away as she could. Look at him and questioning me.
‚ÄúWell, if you're feeling better, you should head out to church studies or whatever the hell that is.‚Äù
Daniel‚Äôs face brightens and jumps off the nurse‚Äôs bed.
‚ÄúBye Mis Handcock‚Ä¶  see you later Rebecca.‚Äù
Daniel leaves before I could scold him. 
‚ÄúYour new here too, right?‚Äù
I look back at the nurse and node my head.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt find this place weird?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù Fustration fills her face.
‚ÄúOh, come on! The people who work here? Emotionless shells. The building, I keep hearing screams and grinding gears coming from the church‚Äôs doors! I try to bring it up to others and they just ignore me or ask me to go in and join the service‚Ä¶ I ain‚Äôt fucking doing that. Oh, and the children! That ain‚Äôt the first time a student bite or bite off a piece of someone‚Äôs skin. These fucking kids are demo-‚Äù 
‚ÄúSHUT UP.‚Äù A deep anger leaking out surprising the both of us.
The nurse walks to her desk quietly.
‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving‚Ä¶ I suggest you do the same...‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt respond, but before I leave, I look back at the metal trash can. Only thing in it, blood-stained gauze and gloves.

	6
	The next day I was told 5 new students were joining my class.
‚ÄúThe more the merrier.‚Äù I told the student to have a seat.
‚ÄúMrs Handcock, do you mind if we talk outside the class?‚Äù
I follow the principle outside my classroom, he shuts the door and faces me.
Before you hear it from anyone else, I‚Äôm here to tell you that. Mr. Richardson and Nurse Sanchez were fired this morning before entering the school. 
‚ÄúWas it because of the incident with Daniel‚Äôs?‚Äù Nodding his head,
‚ÄúYes, when you assault a minor. It is an immediate termination. As for Nurse Sanchez, she was caught intoxicated during church studies.‚Äù
‚ÄúBut.‚Äù I stop myself...
Examining my face.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre you too friends?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know what to say, but I should lie. But what if It was all a mistake?
‚ÄúI actually-‚Äù Mikeal gutters a deep moan. His face freeze in place. I watch in confusion. Blood trickles down his ears.
‚ÄúOh my god, are you alright?‚Äù Asking hesitantly.
As if being released, he starts breathing again. Looking around at me in surprise, or fear?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, I am sorry for disturbing you... please excuse me.‚Äù
He turns and walks in a fast pace down the hall blood drips follow. Concern fills and drains as soon as I hear a deep female voice. I tilt my head closer to the door. But I don‚Äôt understand it, the language is one I never heard before.
I glance through the class window and see her. Sarah towering over one of the new students. Face sunken in red, black think vines popping from her neck, fear cementing me from entering. Her eyes, Black slug pulsing out consuming the entire eye. Slowly spilling out and spreading past her eye sockets in every direction of her face. 
Daniel‚Äôs face covered the window with his smile. Door swinging open as he grabs my wrist and pulls me in.
‚ÄúHow was your conversation with the principle?‚Äù
I grab my pulsing wrist, I look at him close the class door then make his way to his seat. I don‚Äôt look at her, I don‚Äôt want too. I try to act like everything is normal and reach for a dry eraser. Warm hands cup over mine as I feel a marker be places on it. Expecting to know who it is. She stands right next to me looking into my eyes. Face back to normal, a smile fills her face. That same warm smile as the first day of school. But the warmth it offered, isn‚Äôt there anymore. Fear has replaced it. 
	7
	After class ending the children left. I stayed in the classroom. Afraid to leave, I grab daddy and hold him tight. 
‚ÄúAre you there?‚Äù
Nothing‚Ä¶ even his fur is cold and empty
I throw the stuff bear in the trash. And hide my head into my arms. As fear and exhaustion spill out of my eyes. Sleep over takes me.
I awaken in a shadow consumed classroom.
‚ÄúShit shit shit!‚Äù The realization that this was the last place I wanted to be at night.
I look outside the window... the sun hasn‚Äôt set yet. I grab my bag and run out the door. I stop my sprinting when I see the teachers gathering at the end of the hall. They are all in naked covered in slug with chains around their arms.
 They are holding down someone.
Sharp chilling scream fills the hall. As nurse Sanchez is held down hands blacked hands forcing her jaws to stay open.
She sees me and tries to break free squirming and kicking. What do I do? 
White empty eyes, flesh tightening over their widening gaping mouths.
‚ÄúRUN!‚Äù  Sanchez‚Äôs guttering scream forces my mind back to flight mode.
I run the opposite way. Dreading the thought of what will happen to her. I can‚Äôt think about that right now I have to get the hell out of here. I Turn right then left, 
‚ÄúFuck where‚Äôs the exit!‚Äù But every turn is the same. I pass hallways that mirror each other. It has me trapped.
I stop at a 4way intersecting hallways. Heart faltering as the shadows around me start to enclose on me.
A familiar growling voice fills my ear
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù fire igniters in my stomach, that dads voice.
‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù I don‚Äôt hesitate and run. 
‚ÄúIgnore them? What white doors? Why have you been ignoring-‚Äù 
The sound of bone crunching and wailing stop my running. I look left and find coach Richardson and‚Ä¶ Daniel?
Its not him‚Ä¶ The thing that has Richardson is hidden in the shadows of the classroom, grey moist elongated arms.
One has spit in two crucifying him face down on top of a broken desk. Slowly extending out of the shadow, is another arm, this one isn‚Äôt split but whole thick and grey.
Bone and ligaments crack and stretch as it hovering over the coach.
His face looks up in terror as he continues to wail and squirm. Hope leaves him as I hear his wailing quiet down to a deep sobbing crying.
Black fingers protracting from the arm, slowly stretching into sharp needle ends. It hovers and moves aligning its directory, readying to penetrate. Thick black slug start seeping out of the fingers and onto Richardsons screaming face and down his throat.
His eyes finally find me, but no words just deep liquid filled guttering sent out my way.
Daniel‚Äôs face stays in the shadow, but I know he sees me.
Then I notice them.
Smaller grey skinned child cautiously crawls out of the shadow trying not to get closer to Richardson but‚Ä¶ 
It looks at me, staring back to Daniel then back too me. I start walking backwards as I see its over stretched face. Arms not as long as Daniel‚Äôs but they‚Äôre shaped the same way, and their sharp. More grey children come out of the shadow curious to what‚Äôs outside the classroom. I don‚Äôt wait any longer I run not looking back as I hear a loud door close and what sounds like muffled wailing. 
I see the white doors and run through them, falling onto grass.
Grass. I touched the grass and get up I look behind me and see a quiet school. No screaming, no nothing. Just a school ground under the night sky.
‚Äú‚Ä¶..‚Äù
Daddy.. I turn. 
Sarah walks out of the forest. Eyes blacken, skin grey as the moon. But she doesn‚Äôt look like what Daniel is. 
She‚Äôs Sarah.
She holds my Teddy Bear. 
‚ÄúWhy do you have him!‚Äù
Terrified of what she can do to me I still let out my anger.
She walks too me slowly‚Ä¶
Everything inside me is telling me to run, but her smile. I wait, accepting what death may have for me.
She stops in front of me and hands me the bear.
I grab him holding him tight.
I hear his voice but.
It doesn‚Äôt come from the bear anymore..
Sarah smiles and walks besides me holding my hand and facing the forest.
I look in the same directions, trees crack and break.
The voice, my dads voice is coming from whatever is behind those trees. A deep breathe blows our way, stronger then any breeze but gentle and warm as a loving hug.
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs my dad also, he‚Äôs all ours. I look behind me. Dark Silhouettes fill the schools windows. I look back at the forest, where he hides.
I feel Sarah‚Äôs hand slightly tighten.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been waiting for you, he‚Äôs showed us your dreams. We‚Äôve felt what you felt, stay here and you will never be alone ever again.
Tears fall as I turn to Sarah. My heart bleeding torn open. I break and hug her.
She puts her hands around me holding me tight. The silhouettes start shaking the windows. Deep vibrations surround the school yard. A deep warm breathe passes by us again.
I feel Sarah body slowly stretch matching my height. 
Stretching bones and ligaments fill my hear as I feel her breath get closer to my ear.
No long in Sarah‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶ but something older and deep.
‚ÄúNo longer will you be the servant of pain, for we are the hands of the new Gods.‚Äù

1igao4c,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmotionalLARPing/comments/1igao4c/loneliness/,loneliness,"I just watched a 50 minute long youtube video 'why we are lonely' and my emotions were hopeful that perhaps they would suggest some specific and practical ways to help ease the suffering of loneliness, maybe activity or friend apps or specific ways to connect with others maybe like how to ask someone for connection or how to have more meaningful conversations with others... nope. 

My emotions got the impression it was describing what loneliness is, but people who are watching already feel it and know they are looking for more meaningful connection, but then the damn author started shitting on social media and ai and digital medium in a way that was 'lol stop using it and go outside' but where broski, you want people to fucking walk into a coffee shop and start talking to random fuckers or some shit? 

Fuck that, no body is doing that bub even you dude, so all these 'lol go outside' comments to people looking to nurture their loneliness need to seriously fuck off if they aren't going to dive deep into how to nurture fear, trauma, boundaries, consent, emotionally suppressive behaviors, dehumanization, etc from 'going outside' talking to 'randos on the street' to help loneliness because if they don't? They are asking people to fucking traumatize their own fear and doubt because those emotions are going to come up and this asshole would be suggesting they 'power through' fear and shit. 

Basically this video and the comments below can be summed up 'yeah bro i'm lonely too but stop using digital means to connect with people or ai and like read a fucking book or do laundry or find a hobby where you are alone in your apartment' like what the actual fuck kind of shit advice is that because I know my loneliness would be  scowling at me watching me read a fucking book while it is standing there going 'bro why is reading a book going to help me, your loneliness, whose emotional need is for meaningful connection with other human beings??' 

The state of advice for helping people care and nurture their loneliness on youtube is fucking terrible and could harm someone because this video is asking people to disconnect themselves from their current coping mechanisms of social media and ai and replacing it with fuck-all....

Youtube commentors: 

""Better to have a one-sided conversation with dead authors than a two-way conversation with an AI....It really is that damn phone. 

Seriously, what a well written, filmed, edited, paced, thought out video. Truly well written. I personally believe social media, smartphones, and the time we spend online are the biggest causes for loneliness. 

And somehow we always hesitate to acknowledge this, as if we were scared to lose something if we just deleted all of the apps that don't even help us to stay connected in the first place. Instead, people keep making excuses to justify them ‚Äî even as they contribute to the very loss, not just our sense of self, but of genuine human connection and the meaning of community....

How did we get so lonely? By replacing genuine, in-person, community activities, and relationships with online ""community,"" remote work, etc. 

Aristotle tells us that friendship/relationships require proximity; I think he's 100% correct. It's simple man is an inherently relational animal and when we isolate ourselves from other people we WILL become lonely and mentally ill....People need the life skills of personal physical interaction...I normally find something that can immediately act on within 5 mins. 

Because the task feels kinda dumb and can be started immediately, its usually fairly easy to do. They don't usually have a massive impact, and usually you don't expect them to. But I've had major obstacles in my life clear up as the problems face a 'tipping point' where enough of the small, dumb contributing factors get cleared up that the big stuff starts to move.

For loneliness it can be hard, but sometimes something as simple as ironing your shirts, or changing your dog-walking route, or scheduled gym time, or something that feels like it mattered a little but is kinda dumb in comparison to the problem. 

Big dramatic changes get all the attention 'phone detox' or 'start a new social circle', but the small dumb stuff really does add up, and if you keep trying small dumb stuff eventually you find that some really affects you.""

Last Sunday I wake up with a sore throat up in my sinus. I pay attention to it because it doesn't clear with my morning coffee (I have had a lot of allergy related sinus problems that clear with coffee), and by the end of the day it's gone.

Nothing else is really a problem until Tuesday afternoon when I feel slightly under the weather and leave work early. 

On Wednesday I know I'm sick, but decide to keep a prior speaking engagement I had set up with work. I made it through the presentation with no issues and chalk up my illness to a slight cold.

Thursday all hell breaks loose, I have a deep and painful dry cough that sometimes is so hard to shake that sometime I feel like I'm going to tear my esophagus, running a consistent fever of 103, massive body load, chills that touch my soul, sweat that I can wring out of my sheets, physical and mental disassociation, sleeping close to 12-14 hours a day, fever dreams, no voice, the inability to eat any solid food, loss of taste.

I am now on day 4 of these crazy symptoms. Through I feel like today was the first day I felt a slight improvement, but I am heavily medicated so I'm not sure. I am still running a fever when the medicine wears off and will probably be in urgent care in the AM if I am still running a fever over 100.

Sorry, I'm just complaining. I have had a ton of illness, I work in sales so I have a lot of physical contact with people and travel often. Never in my life have I had it this bad, not COVID, not other hard flu seasons, not ever swine flu (which I was blessed to have caught) did me in like this one. And I'm vaccinated.

A few weeks ago it died :( But eventually I brought it back to life be replacing a solenoid and elbow joint. While I was researching I saw a video about running rice through the grinder to clean it out, so I did.

Something has gone weird along the way. Suddenly I need the internal grind setting on 1 and outside dial around 7-10 to get the pressure gauge around 12. This is while actually measuring out 18g, but even then 36g takes about 22s at most.

I have so much embarrassment and shame about having them in public / work which is almost always where it happens. I also feel shamed by a lot physicians because they treat me like I‚Äôm drug seeking when I ask for Ativan, especially due to my history with weed.

* Homebody who enjoys the simple pleasures and the freedom that comes with being permanently childfree (getting sterilized soon, yay!)
* Non-religious, smoking/drug-free, and mostly alcohol-free

1igaclf,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1igaclf/instacart_shoppers/,Instacart Shoppers,"I don't think I've encountered a less generally competent group of people than Instacart shoppers. Granted, the normal interactions I have with them don't really stand out in my memories, but holy hell, The bad ones sure do. 

It usually goes something like this:

I'm stocking something, turn around and get jumpscared by a phone approximately 3 inches from my face. They then mumble something resembling, but not quite, human speech. Assuming they're looking for the item displayed on their phone (which I am physically leaning backwards to actually be able to see), I point them towards the item (usually not in my department), and they wordlessly trundle off to go find it. Sometimes that's the end. Otherwise, they'll walk across the store, find what they were looking for AND THEN DRAG THEIR ASS back to me (where I have resumed, you know, doing my job) and the cycle starts again. 
I've sent people to the oposite end of the store from me, they would have had to walk past multiple other employees, through multiple grocery aisles, just to come back to me, the only person working in the produce section, just to ask about pasta or coffee or something that's obviously not in my department. 

We have a big ass guide hanging in the middle of the store, we also have them hanging off the end of every aisle. I would write that they must not be able to read as a joke, but it's not. I have genuinely encountered instacart shoppers who could not read english, they literally just went off the pictures. It's almost commendable.
One lady in particular needed help weighing something, a fairly common ask, our scales kind of blend in with the surroundings so people need help finding them all the time. After showing her the scales, and some more mumbled speech the actual problem became clear.

It wasn't that she didn't know where to find the scales, it was that she did not understand the imperial mesurement system in the slightest.

After a second of dumbfounded shock and silently wondering how the hell the signup process for this app even works, I then had to explain that ""the scale is pointing at 2 1/2 lbs, so click this box here, and type in 2 1/2"".

It's extra fun when I have to play tech support for them because they don't know how to use their phone. They'll accidentally close the app, and then stand there and scroll through every single tab and application on their phone to try and find where it went. Every single time I think, ""yep, this is gonna be the day I see a straight up dick pic"".

Somehow, none of this is the weirdest thing I've encountered. One day, someone walked up to me and instead of wordlessly shoving their phone in my face, they tried to hand it to me. Not wanting to grab this random guys phone, I did the usual routine of telling him where the item was located. He was confused at this, and through what could once again, be charitably described as heavily accented english, I discovered he was looking for someone to shop an order for him.
Ahhh I see, he's just confused. We have a grocery pickup service that works through instacart (or something similar, I'm not sure on the specifics as I've only really worked over there once, but thats a separate story...), he's here to pick up an order, not shop for someone. So I try to explain to him where he needs to go, but slowly while that's happening I'm realizing ""wait, no that doesn't make sense"", and finally I realize whats happening. 
He's not looking for his online order, he thinks the store employees do the shopping for instacart deliveries. By this time he's already walking towards the service counter, he delivers one final gem, ""if I have to shop it, I just cancel their order. Is too much walking"". 
I remember those words exactly because I think I had an aneurysm trying to understand his thought process, I think I just went catatonic for a full 5 seconds.
May God help whatever poor soul was working the service counter that day, I'm sorry. I didn't know what I was dooming you to, please forgive me.

Look man, I don't have a problem helping out people. Even if you're asking something dumb or obvious, as long as you're polite I'll get you what you need, no problem. I DO HOWEVER, have a problem if you decide to make me do half of your job for you. I'm here to help customers and stock the shelf, I'm not a subcontractor. I got shit to do. Its not MY job to fix YOUR inability to do YOUR job.

Seven years ago, when my wife and I and I bought our first house, the Purple Lobster sneakers released around the same time.

Then, the pandemic hit, and the price skyrocketed. Fast forward five years, and now finding any new pair would be paying well over 20x the price they were then. 

Recently, I received a great promotion at work thanks to hard work (and u/recalledtuna) During this time, I kept coming back to these shoes, constantly checking for an available pair. I found one on StockX that was the ‚ÄúSpecial Box‚Äù version and I kept going back and forth, debating whether to buy them and one day they were just gone. It was a bit of a letdown, but I figured I‚Äôd just grab a used pair eventually. 

Then, last night, my wife and her friends called me into the dining room, and there, sitting on the table, was a brand new pair of Purple Lobsters.

He didn‚Äôt want to go. CN didn‚Äôt want to look stupid. He didn‚Äôt like the idea. This is the man who will go to the ends of the earth to take his emotional affair partner/subordinate out for expensive lunches to celebrate her big days, on coffee dates, spend months curating special and personalized gifts for her, etc. But I can‚Äôt get a single diner dinner? Okay, then.

He finally agreed to go, but he sat there like an angry mute with a scowl on his face, making what was supposed to be a silly and fun event totally miserable. But, of course, I can‚Äôt say anything about his behavior, because then I am ‚Äúpicky and mean.‚Äù

What Exactly is the Keto Diet?

The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, moderate-protein, and extremely low-carbohydrate eating plan designed to push your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. In this state, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. To achieve this, you'll need to dramatically reduce your carbohydrate intake and replace it with healthy fats.

Essential Foods for Your Keto Diet

When considering what do I need for keto diet success, food selection is crucial. Here are the key food categories you'll want to stock in your kitchen:

1. Healthy Fats
- Avocado
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Coconut oil
- Butter and ghee
- Fatty fish
- Nuts and seeds

2. Protein Sources
- Grass-fed beef
- Free-range chicken
- Wild-caught fish
- Eggs
- Lamb
- Turkey

3. Low-Carb Vegetables
- Spinach
- Kale
- Broccoli
- Cauliflower
- Zucchini
- Bell peppers

Macronutrient Breakdown

Understanding the right macronutrient ratios is critical for keto diet success. Typically, your daily intake should consist of:
- 70-75% fat
- 20-25% protein
- 5-10% carbohydrates

Supplements to Support Your Keto Journey

To ensure you're getting all necessary nutrients while minimizing potential side effects, consider these supplements:

1. Electrolytes
Maintaining electrolyte balance is crucial during the initial transition to a keto diet. Look for supplements containing:
- Sodium
- Potassium
- Magnesium

2. MCT Oil
Medium-chain triglycerides can help:
- Boost energy
- Support ketone production
- Enhance mental clarity

Kitchen Tools for Keto Meal Preparation

Equipping your kitchen with the right tools will make your keto journey smoother:

1. Food Scale
Precise measurement is key to tracking macronutrients accurately.

2. High-Quality Blender
Perfect for making smoothies, sauces, and bulletproof coffee.

3. Air Fryer
Allows you to cook crispy foods with minimal oil.

4. Digital Meal Prep Containers
Helps with portion control and meal planning.

Potential Side Effects and How to Manage Them

The **keto flu** is a common initial challenge when starting the diet. Symptoms might include:
- Fatigue
- Headaches
- Irritability
- Difficulty concentrating

Manage these by:
- Staying hydrated
- Consuming adequate electrolytes
- Getting enough sleep
- Gradually reducing carbohydrates

Meal Planning and Preparation Strategies

Successful keto dieting requires strategic planning:
- Prep meals in advance
- Create a weekly meal schedule
- Stock up on keto-friendly snacks
- Learn to read nutrition labels
- Keep emergency keto-friendly foods on hand

Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Not drinking enough water
2. Consuming low-quality fats
3. Neglecting vegetable intake
4. Overlooking hidden carbohydrates
5. Not tracking macronutrients

I dont need clothes, I have casual office clothes and weekend clothes.  If its a really good mark down i might pick something up.  I don't need much right now.  I'm going to need several pair of sandals.  Its hot here and sandals are worn all the time.

FOOD:  I have zero idea how to budget for food.  This is what brought me here.  I have celiac and a couple food allergies.  Groceries always run on the high side and convenience  is important.  I do like to bake but again, convenience.  So I'm more likely to pick a packaged back mix vs going 100% from scratch.

Medical is costly. I can't just stop medication or dr's appointments,  health insurance is insane.  Dental and vision is the same-  RX is a mystery.

My downfall is books, (and yarn).  I love to read and I tend to buy most of my books, i try to wait for buy 2 get 1 free.  I do utilize the library as well.

1igaa8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/woodworking/comments/1igaa8b/furniture_made_from_decking_boards/,Furniture made from decking boards ?,"Hello guys,

  
I¬¥ve playing with an idea recently since hardwood boards in general are pretty expensive for me.

  
As examples to relate to prices and the reason why I¬¥m thinking about this. Wood species does not really matter. It¬¥s all about using hardwood and being able to not use plywood :

Hardwood board 2000x300x19mm around 200USD

Plywood 2440x1220x12mm AA Grade around 70 USD

Hardwood decking board 2500x140x19mm 16USD

So I found some insanely cheap hardwood decking boards. Visiually I think they look really beautiful. Of course it¬¥s not 1 continous board it¬¥s made from around 3-4 pieces which is why it¬¥s so cheap. But still they look really beautiful... and it¬¥s REAL wood.

  
My idea was to build a bookcase, coffee table, desk/computer table, bed table and a Dresser/Tallboy to replace my unbeloved MDF Ikea furniture. that would be at least the project for the next months weekends.

  
With the decking board all I have to do is to plane the sides down to squares (they¬¥re pencil rounded) and then I can already directly join them together as there is the option to buy them either oiled or without any finish (I wanted to use Danish oil and definitely oil them myself). I admit I¬¥ve never joined such long boards together before so I probably either have to build a clamp rig or might buy even a rig since I could keep using decking boards in future as a cheaper alternative for some fun projects. Also they¬¥re also available in different species and at the end it¬¥ll remain much cheaper for me to build from decking boards.

Of course it¬¥s nothing premium, but to me somebody who had only particle board or plywood furniture, having real wood furniture is already premium. 

  
So did anybody ever try before building furniture out of decking boards ?

Did you see something or notice something I might have not seen.. maybe something obvious I turned a blind eye on ?

  
So my question might be a bit stupid but I wanted to ask this because I thought maybe somebody did it before and can stop me from doing something really stupid. But as far as I see it decking boards are also just hardwood and as long as I buy them unfinished it should be fairly simple to join them to the needed width to build the furniture I want to build.

  
FYI: I¬¥m just a guy enjoying a hobby. It doesn¬¥t matter to me if it takes 1 week or 1 month or 3 months to finish to build 1 furniture piece. My ikea crap furniture is still fine but just unbeloved. I even use mainly hand tools. So I do not have a powered planer, I¬¥ll do it by hand. But I don¬¥t see a problem as the decking board is 19mm in width so my jack plane could do it as for the width in one go (but probably I¬¥m gonna buy a joint planer (hand tool)).",1,1738537075.0,woodworking,0,1.0,False

1iga9gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/OrthodoxChristianity/comments/1iga9gx/we_received_pledge_request_form/,We received pledge request form?,"Greetings! Christ is risen! 

Recently, around the new year, our church was setting out a new budget, and asked everyone there that day to stay after coffee hour and meet about the budget. We were informed about various spending the church does each year and so forth. Then, they passed out pledge forms to everyone asking to make a weekly, monthly or yearly pledge. Now, I grew up protestant, my wife grew up catholic, we both converted and were chrismated (and I, baptized) at Pascha 2024. We have given what we can in offering since then. Sometimes, several hundred, or at the lowest, 40 dollars. Lord have mercy on me for reporting the offerings, but I do so to mention that we are not avoiding giving to the church, at all. My wife and I do not make very much together, though we are blessed to have what we need. We had a lot of unexpected financial hardship last year, and so, reluctantly and after much discussion, we chose not to make any kind of pledge. We still plan on giving every month, we are simply unsure of what we will be able to give each month, as this are still fluctuating. I work a day job at a warehouse, and at night I run my own martial arts school with my wife, and a partner also runs it with his wife. It's a great business and we're incredibly blessed, though, it's certainly not any kind of cash cow. I was informed last week that my day job will be closing their only location in my city, so I will be at half income for an unforseen length of time. Today, at church, the treasurer (I think that's what you call them?) Gave us another pledge form, with the clear undertone of ""you haven't turned in your pledge yet."" Yes, I'm inferring these words in my head. But, how could I not? It was not an appropriate time to have any sort of conversation about our finances. However, I just want to; 

1. Vent a little bit. I'm hurt. I feel embarrassed. The day I gave $40, I cried driving home, because I accidentally saw the amounts on the ledger that other members were giving, and I felt so ashamed at the size of my offering. I don't want to pledge some tiny amount. I REALLY don't want to have this conversation with anyone at the church. We are really good members. We're just young newlyweds, my wife sings in the chior, and I have a son from a prior relationship. A big part of our financial hardship was because of lawyer costs from custody hearings to get my son back. (He was taken from me when his mom found it I was getting married.) Now I have 50/50 time with him, but we went from having zero debt last year, to $30,000 this year. We live very modestly, in too small of a space. I don't want to tell the church all these things. I don't feel I should have to in order to be left alone about this pledge stuff. So the other thing I wanted to know is; 

2. Is this normal? Is this how orthodox churches are usually run? I have such severe social anxiety, finding liturgy was an absolute Godsend (well yeah haha üòÑ), but now I feel so uncomfortable to be there. My wife is equally offended, as far as I can gather. 

Tl;dr our church asked for a weekly/monthly/yearly monetary pledge. Is this normal?

I finished the Gaggiuino build today. The functional part, at least. 

Need to print the display enclosure, but I have non-standard 3.5"" display and no knowledge of Blender, so it will require some more effort to complete.

I started buying parts on Aliexpress around June 2024 and the last one arrived just last Wed. Because they sent incorrect parts twice (it was my fault the first time,  the second one sellers'). Other things I had to order twice because It got lost (we had a post office strike that time).

The assemble itself is medium level of difficulty, I would say. I organized hard challenges by myself because I bought a differently sized display. Didn't know at the beginning that the display is a big problem of this project. (one of the latest commits has message ""[shitxtion hates programmers](https://github.com/Zer0-bit/gaggiuino/commit/94e0fdbc49386892e0d24ca0ab477691eb215739)"")

I got a lot of new experience debugging this project in VSCode with PIO, even listening to the USART signals using a special hardware. I needed all of these just to clarify issues with the display. It has a binary firmware that is compiled in their ugly looking proprietary program that lacks many basic features.  

So, that I want to say for the big audience here...

1) This mod is amazing. 

2) The author of this mod, questionable. 

3) The Discord community- solved almost any possible issue. 

4) Instructions are correct, I hope they will not delete the source code. 

  
I'm thinking, are you interested in a full sized video about the mod assembly experience or there are enough of it on the internet? 

Generally speaking, I have only two doubts: 

1) For some reason I decided that this project was an open source, but it actually wasn't. And now it's fully **commercial**. You must buy a license\*.

\*the old Lego build is still available but there is no any development planned. 

2) The community was helpful, but it didn‚Äôt seem ready for a dialogue. Any discussions about the code base, sensor choices, or support for different displays were met with the response, 'You can do whatever you want, but we can‚Äôt help you with that.'. Now I understand that they didn't have any interest because new version is significantly different and somehow profitable. Hope it will not destroy the whole project in the longer perspective. 

Besides that I'm extremely satisfied with the result and experience. ",0,1738536954.0,gaggiaclassic,5,0.4,False
1iga8cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/tinnitus/comments/1iga8cj/like_clocks_ticking_ignore_it/,"Like clocks ticking, ignore it.","I have tinnitus since I can remember. Due to this Subreddit, I have been paying more attention to it lately, to the point that, in a day I had too much coffee to drink and some trouble sleeping at night, I got very upset by the ""crickets"" living in my ears - something that hadn't happened for many years before, until I joined this group.

Today I woke up before my wife, went to the kitchen for a sip of water and, on my way back, since it was past 9 o'clock already, I left our bedroom door opened, so to let the morning sun slowly wake us up. Sunlight came not alone, and the ticking of the clock in our entrance hall felt so loud!

Thoughts came and went for a while until I decided to finally stand up. It was then that I realized: I could barely listen to the tick-tack that irritated me so much before.

I guess that it is the same with tinnitus. It is not only a matter of what we hear, but also of where we decide to tune our attention to. For everyone out there struggling with their ringing ears, I say: Stay strong! Go to the doctor, but once there's nothing much more one can do, quit giving it much more attention than it really deserves.   ",1,1738536936.0,tinnitus,4,1.0,False
1iga7nd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1iga7nd/aio_or_am_i_being_led_on/,AIO or am I being led on?,"I (24M) have been talking with this girl (25F) on and off for the last few years. We currently have not seen each other in about 6 years (last time we saw each other was when her older brother was enlisting). I have had some bad experiences with dating in the past that has left me with some abandonment issues and I try my best not to smother her or bug her too much, but I recently feel like I'm being led on. 

I know distance can make things a little rocky as we currently live about 11 hours apart. She's been saying she feels burned out at work and has little energy to do much else which I totally understand but, I can't help but feel as if I'm being used for a confidence boost at this point. We have both shared feelings that we would be interested in making things official and pursuing a relationship, we flirt pretty consistently, I offer to buy her a coffee in the mornings or doordash her dinner after a long day but she never takes me up on it. I feel like things have slowly just been getting more and more distant as of late. The last couple weeks have been nothing but radio silence on her end as well, I've tried calling and texting to try checking in on her but still nothing. Same thing has happened multiple times over the last few years. I'm not one to obsess over a girl until things are at the point that I should be and I know she's her own person with her own life but I just don't know what to do or how to feel anymore.

TLDR: this girl and I have been talking for years and want to make things official but suddenly drops contact. I think I might be getting led on and used as a confidence boost.

1iga59p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1iga59p,Top of The Morning Coffee really is as good as Se√°n says it is! ‚ÄìA side-by-side comparison of ToTM Golden Hour and a commercial brand in a professional kitchen,"I work as a cook in an assisted living home, so I am constantly making coffee for myself and the residents. Yesterday and today, I decided to conduct a blind taste test with the residents. I regularly share my personal orders of ToTM with them, when I can, but more often than not they get the brand the Kitchen Manager orders. Both coffees were prepared in the same grinder, filters, and brewer. Both coffees were Medium Roast, and were fresh from unopened bags.

The results were:
- The residents drank twice as much ToTM as their normal brand
- ToTM was smoother and less acidic tasting
- ToTM had a stronger, more pleasant aroma
- ToTM beans are cleaner and less oily
- ToTM Coffee is more clear and rich, with no visible oil sheen

So, if you're a coffee drinker, definitely consider switching to ToTM if you haven't already. It really is the best! Believe the hype!",20,1738536704.0,jacksepticeye,1,0.92,False
1iga4ws,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogAdvice/comments/1iga4ws/this_is_super_random_but_is_it_possible_that_i/,"This is SUPER random, but is it possible that I could get an infection from a bite from my 11 m/o puppy? (Read for full story)","Ok, so, my dad adopted a ‚Äútoy‚Äù aussiedoodle pup back in April. His name is Tuca, we love him to bits.

unfortunately, he has a tendency to have accidents around the house like most puppies. Recently, he has begun getting into my cat‚Äôs litterbox and well... he‚Äôll eat his poop. We‚Äôve tried our best to keep the door to that room closed as much as possible, but sometimes, someone will forget to close it.

That happened earlier today, and Tuca got into some poop and was laying underneath our coffee table. I could smell it, and he had already eaten it. Usually what we do when he has accidents or gets into the litterbox is we put him in his ‚Äúhouse‚Äù, a cage big enough for him to be comfortable   
I had attempted to grab him out from underneath the table, and he bit me. I have a brief tooth puncture on my hand, but I don‚Äôt think he broke skin. Once I wrapped him with a blanket to get him out from underneath and got him inside, I went and throughly washed my hands and put on some hand sanitizer.

It‚Äôs probably a simple answer with the fact that that he didn‚Äôt break skin, but I‚Äôm not sure. My cat doesn‚Äôt have any health problems that I‚Äôm aware of, but I‚Äôm sure the bacteria in the poop is more than likely harmful, just like any animals.   
I‚Äôll keep an eye on the bite, but can anyone give me any idea if the bite can possibly become infected?",1,1738536678.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False
