1la324m,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsPhilippines/comments/1la324m/married_last_week_and_all_the_things_i/,"Married last week, and all the things I overthought? Wala pala. Everything turned out sooo beautifully.","Just wanted to share a bit about our wedding because grabe, I still can‚Äôt get over it. It rained so hard the day before, as in ulan na parang walang bukas. So syempre, kinabahan ako, nakatameme na ko day before. On top of that, ang dami ko talagang inoverthink, the weather, my arms (LOL), our first dance (we only practiced for two days kasi nga life), yung cocktail hour, and even the church. I love our church, pero kasi ang dami na rin nagpapakasal dun lately so I thought baka ‚Äúsame old‚Äù na siya sa mata ng guests.

Pero nung araw na mismo, wala. As in lahat ng worry ko, nawala.

The weather? Cloudy all day, not hot at all, and it only started raining nung reception na, and everyone was already inside the venue by then. Literal na perfect timing. Our church? Everyone kept saying how beautiful and solemn it was. I honestly thought gasgas na siya, but turns out, people were in love with it. So that made me really happy.

The ceremony was one of my favorite parts. It was so intimate and full of love. And the priest, oh my gosh. First time lang namin siya na-meet on the day itself, pero ang ganda ng homily niya. Guests kept saying how great the message was. Nakakatuwa siya and at the same time, super sincere. Parang siya talaga yung taong pinadala ni Lord para i-bless kami that day.

And our first dance? Despite the limited practice, kaya pala. üòÇ We enjoyed it, and I‚Äôm so glad we just let go and had fun. Also, yung braso ko? Ako lang pala may pake. Literally no one noticed hahaha.

Cocktail hour was super chill, we got to eat, mingle with guests, and drink coffee! What I loved was even our suppliers got to enjoy it, which made it feel more personal and shared. And our photos and SDE? Ugh, everything. I keep rewatching and reliving the day through them. ü•π

And the food ‚Äî grabe, rave reviews talaga. One guest even said na first time niya makaubos ng buong plate sa wedding! üòÇ Sobrang natuwa din sila sa lechon (of course haha). Nakakatuwa na even the food left such a good impression.

If I could give advice to anyone planning right now:

**Enjoy your day. Trust your suppliers and your guests. You chose them for a reason.**  
And don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself. Most of the time, tayo lang talaga yung naglalagay ng pressure sa sarili natin.

Everything will fall into place. Promise. Just hold on, breathe, and let the day surprise you. üíñ

**Also, thank you to this subreddit ‚Äî for all the tips, ideas, and stories that helped me so much along the way. You guys were part of my planning phase more than you know.** ü´∂",2,1749776179.0,WeddingsPhilippines,0,1.0,False
1la31o9,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeleyca/comments/1la31o9/looking_for_a_place_to_play_piano_and_drink/,Looking for a place to play piano and drink coffee or beer,"Used to be a serious pianist ‚Äî played everything from jazz and neo-soul to classical and rock. These days I work a desk job, but I really miss sitting down at a real piano and just getting lost in it, especially with a coffee or a beer in hand.

I‚Äôve got a nice and expensive keyboard at home, which is great for some stuff, but it‚Äôs just not the same as feeling the resonance and weight of a real piano.

Does anyone know of any public pianos in Berkeley where I could drop in and play for a bit? Maybe buy a beer or coffee and chill -- ideally in a place where it wouldn't be weird if I played piano for an hour.

I've been in Berkeley for 9 months now and I haven't ever seen one.",1,1749776140.0,berkeleyca,0,1.0,False
1la31n4,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudioApartments/comments/1la31n4/would_a_workoutfurniture_hybrid_be_helpful_in_a/,Would a workout-furniture hybrid be helpful in a studio apartment?,"Hey everyone! I‚Äôm a high school student working on a summer entrepreneurship program, and I‚Äôm developing an idea for a product designed with small-space living in mind, including people in **studio apartments**. The concept is a **coffee table or ottoman that doubles as workout equipment**. It functions like normal furniture when not in use, but can be quickly converted to do exercises like seated leg lifts, step-ups, resistance band work (which allows for exercises like lat pulldowns, rows, curls, and many others), and tricep dips. The goal is to make it easy to stay active *without* needing to rearrange your entire apartment or buy bulky gym equipment that takes up precious space.

I know how limited space can be in a studio, so I‚Äôm hoping to learn from people who actually live in them:

* Is this something you could see being useful in your space?
* What features would make it more practical or appealing?
* Is there anything about the idea that might not work for you?

It‚Äôs still in early development, but I believe there‚Äôs real potential here, and I‚Äôd love to keep improving it beyond the summer. Thanks so much. Any feedback (good or bad) is super appreciated!",1,1749776137.0,StudioApartments,0,1.0,False

Hoping to meet someone who'd also like to develop chemistry over a cuddle and a conversation. It's been a long few weeks and I've been having some trouble sleeping over work, recent events, and life all together. Being lonely is nothing new so I'm challenging myself to connect with other lovely folk and talk about anything that comes up. There's something deeply fulfilling about prospering from one another's presence and dialogue.

About me: 28, 5'6"", latino, i thoroughly enjoy exercising, watching and identifying birds, jazz clubs, museum visitations, and movie watching.

1la2ta5,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1la2ta5/more_of_a_vent/,More of a vent.,"I have been in my current relationship for almost 11 years. I immediately entered this relationship from a 20 year verbally, physically, and sexually abusive marriage. We both actually came from relationships that were very bad. He helped me through my entire divorce. He has been a good father figure to my 4 sons. We now have a 7 & 9 year old together. He is legally married still. From the beginning he would keep me on the phone with him for hours while he was at work (local truck driver) and I have been a stay at home mom which he has financially supported. My older children‚Äôs father relinquished all rights and he stepped right in. When we met I was volunteering at a local church thrift store and I would volunteer at my children‚Äôs schools and the local boys and girls club where they participated in sports. Once we became a couple he slowly made me feel guilty about doing any of those things. If a friend called and he was home (yes he immediately moved in with me) he would look at me like he was sad that I would use the little time he was not working to talk to others so I would quickly wrapped it up. Quickly I stopped taking calls. I stopped having people to hang out with because if I would even say I was going to take the kids to the park he would want to FaceTime me and see if there were others there. If they were he would still keep me on the phone with him. He would ask to see what I was wearing each day which I thought was him just wanting to see me. Slowly I lost all connections. He told me when I talked to people and looked them in the eye I was giving them the impression that i ‚Äúwanted them‚Äù. So I began looking down so as not to make him feel disrespected. I thought all of this was love. I have been homeschooling our children because he wants to protect them from the system- which to me is funny since one of my older children is trans. On April 5th something happened that triggered me maybe? He is a little league coach and we were at the field. I was with our youngest at the playground and he must‚Äôve seen me walk towards the concession stand because as I was talking to the people inside he came up behind me and hit my butt with the notebook and said ‚Äúwhat are you doing?‚Äù In quite the dad voice.Which shocked me and scared me. It didn‚Äôt hurt. When I looked at him he smiled and one of the ladies working told him to not abuse me and to leave me alone. He defended himself and said he was only joking but then quickly again in a softer voice asked me again what I was doing?? I told him getting water to which he told me I should‚Äôve come to him for some. Anyway, after that I have had ALL THE REALIZATIONS! It‚Äôs all come to light. I was always the initiator with sex and he would always have reason why we couldn‚Äôt. But since April when I told him I was done and pointed everything out to him he has sworn he will change. He has changed some things but it‚Äôs like 2 steps forward 3 steps back. Now he always wants sex. He makes me coffee in the morning. He writes me sweet notes. He tells me he‚Äôs not going to get jealous about things but then will watch me from the window when I go check the mail or tell me I‚Äôm showing myself to the world when I‚Äôm in his truck with fully tented windows. I‚Äôve stopped taking his phone calls during the day while he‚Äôs working. He‚Äôs gotten an attorney and his divorce will be finalized soon. 
He‚Äôs a great dad. The sex is great. We don‚Äôt have much in common besides our kids though. He just takes on whatever opinions I have. I have been praying for guidance and I must be doing it wrong because I am more confused. ",1,1749775447.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Been poly for 8 years because I never understood why society said I had to be constrained to one intimate partner. After all, I have capacity to kiss, get coffee, walk around the park, dress up at a winery, or cuddle all my friends, because all relationships kind of feel the same to me regardless of platonic vs fwb vs ""romantic"" nature. ""Romantic gestures"" just seem like regular gestures to me because I can consider my friends and do things for them just the same as I would for a partner or FWB.

I spend a lot of time with people, some I consider partners and some I consider friends, but the label on the relationship is entirely based on whether or not we've discussed enmeshment and commitment of some kind to one another. For example, I have a commitment to remain in S' life as an emotionally supportive and sexually connected ""partner,"" but we only talk a little bit and see each other every one to four weeks, but my homie W and I are arguably more enmeshed given our more frequent interactions and our plans to potentially buy a house together and co-own some projects. I'd be equally devastated to lose either S or W, but W isn't technically a partner just because we haven't explicitly discussed a commitment like that.

My willingness to enmesh, support, and depend on someone is basically based on a combination of physical attraction, objective compatibility (values, time, etc.), and interactive chemistry (does conversation flow naturally? do we bounce energy off each other?), but I don't really ""feel"" different for partners vs friends vs FWBs. I care about all of them similarly and can experience excitement and anxiety all the same, regardless of the label on the relationship.

In the past, the only indicator that I felt ""romantic"" towards someone was my capacity to feel anxious if I got insecure about losing them, but it doesn't feel right to have to use a negative emotion like anxiety to identify ""romance,"" and I think losing anybody you spend a lot of time with can cause anxiety.

It doesn't ultimately matter since it's all just a construct, but it's definitely interesting. I don't know if I'm aromantic or aplatonic but I do know that I can't tell the difference between romantic and platonic feelings. Thoughts?",1,1749775020.0,aromantic,3,1.0,False

I informed her dad that we have a celebration at church afterwards and my wife got on to me days later because she didn‚Äôt like the fact that I said we have a church event and thinks I confused her dad. Anyways, after I told her I‚Äôm not going today.. she knocked my coffee out of my hand and started saying things such as her and baby would be better off with me. I‚Äôve done nothing but work hard and love my family. I was working a dead end job $16 an hour (landscaping) and coming home to do software engineering praying that the Lord would provide me with a better job to take care of my family and he provided that job a few weeks ago right on time before baby will be here. It was all for my family but I just don‚Äôt know if I can go on like this. I feel like I‚Äôm walking on egg shells around my wife. I‚Äôm happier at work than home.

Asleep on the jumpseat twice in first
Class 


I just worked fwd galley with a flight attendant as a purser. They were two years in. Our flight was going just OK. I noticed he wasn‚Äôt as active or engaging with the passengers but I‚Äôm very positive and easy
Going and didn‚Äôt mind giving  great service and doing  purser
Responsibilities just as long as it got done.  But now I‚Äôm upset 

The real problem: when it came time to final and getting into our jump seats. I believe we may have circled for a little bit. I had noticed his phone drop and then it dropped the second time and when I looked over, I realize that he was actually falling asleep on the jump seat. But more sitting up. I rubbed his arm waking him up and him making sure that he was OK, thinking that would do the trick. Which is normally does‚Ä¶. :/ 

A few moments later I had my head to the left looking out galley window to see where we were when I turned back his head was legit slumped over/down in the jumpseat and I jerked him up, more stern this time I told him it‚Äôs my job on the line now too like I need you awake do you need a cup of coffee legit anything and he said no he was fine and apologized


I‚Äôm just super worried that someone and 1EF or 2EF saw him sleeping maybe even before I realized it 

This is all added extra but besides doing our meal service, he did not do compliance. Never a trash pick up. It was a longer Flight. Kept asking
To use
My device for meal service or announcements cuz his was in his purse. He sat on his jumpseat with his phone very loud scrolling through social media while I was taking care of
First
Class. he said sorry I normally wear my AirPods (on the jumpseat?). I think one of the reasons that he was so sleepy was because he legit didn‚Äôt do any purser responsibilities just delivered trays that I set up for
Meals :/ 

I am really torn right now because I pray every day that I don‚Äôt get involved in anything and now I‚Äôm left with this circumstance. I‚Äôm trying to think that he just had a bad day, but his behavior makes me think otherwise 

I‚Äôm just trying to save myself in this matter tbh if a passenger does report it. I dont condone sleeping on the jump seat, I‚Äôm cool but not that cool. 

Above all else I didn‚Äôt feel safe next
To him or that he cared about safety 

I really feel like I‚Äôm damned if I do and I‚Äôm damned if I don‚Äôt :/ 

I freaking love my job I love being out there and being a great host to my
Peeps even when company treats us like hell :/ please help me I don‚Äôt want to get anyone in trouble but I don‚Äôt want someone else‚Äôs bad actions to get me in trouble or fired ?! 

It‚Äôs very odd because I feel like when it comes to safety in the passengers I have no problem saying anything to them but when it comes to other flight attendant, I am afraid that my crew will turn on me or I‚Äôll just get this bad confrontation even when I know
I‚Äôm in the right ",2,1749774638.0,flightattendants,6,1.0,False

I am a bit worried. I will be 4 months postpartum next week.

I am very sleep deprived at the moment, most nights getting 4-5 hours. A good night I will get 6 and a bad night 3. Before I would usually sleep 8-9 hours a night. I also have had other stressors in my life at the moment. I am slightly overweight with a bmi of 26.5.

My fasting numbers tend to be 5.8-6.1ish in the morning after 8-12 hours of not eating and even after eating very healthy the day before. 

Sometimes my numbers after eating are high but usually only after I have had a treat or had a white carb heavy meal. I am also usually having 2-3 black coffees a day, but take my morning number before I have my coffee.

I did have gestational diabetes this pregnancy that I managed through diet alone and I my numbers are worse now then when I was pregnant. 

Did anyone else have a similar experience to this and did their sugars return to normal after they started getting more sleep/had less stress?

I am going to go do blood work soon, just worried.

1la2b7x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1la2b7x,Week of 6/15/25 - What I'm feeding my family of 5 this week for $125,"People seemed to find the first week‚Äôs menu helpful, so I decided to put together a menu post for next week as well. If you didn‚Äôt see my first menu post you can find it here:

>[What I'm feeding my family of 5 this week for $125](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/1l6ocmu/what_im_feeding_my_family_of_5_this_week_for_125/)

To recap, we are a family of 5 (2 adults & 3 teens). We live in a large urban area in the Midwest. Our grocery budget is around $500 a month, so I average about $125 on an average week for groceries. We have no major food allergies & no special diets being followed. Just trying to feed my family filling, reasonably healthy meals without breaking the bank.

**TLDR;**  
The first part of this post is explaining some about the process I use to plan our menus since people seemed interested. Skip down to just see this week‚Äôs menu & complete shopping list. As you scroll down it will be - menu plan, my personal shopping list, a complete shopping list for this week, then recipes.

**How I Menu Plan ‚Äì Reverse Meal Planning**

The first thing I do when I want to plan a menu is take a quick look at our pantry, fridge & freezer to see what we have on hand.

Normally, people making a meal plan base it off whatever random recipes they feel like eating that week, then creating their shopping list from that.

In reverse meal planning you look at what you have on hand FIRST, then plan your meals around the (hopefully inexpensive!) ingredients you‚Äôve already bought.

After I‚Äôve ‚Äúshopped my pantry first‚Äù I then make a list of whatever ingredients I still need at the store to make that week‚Äôs recipes. I also include any items that are running low on the list. If someone uses the last or second to last of something they add it to the shopping list on the whiteboard on the side of the fridge.

Then I sit at the laptop and spend about 30 min checking the prices of the items on my shopping list on the websites or apps of the stores I most commonly shop at. Each item, more or less, goes on the list for the store it‚Äôs currently the cheapest at. The stores are all within 5 miles of each other. I shop in a loop, hitting the bargain outlet store first to get whatever I can there, then move onto the regular stores like Meijer, Aldi, Kroger, Sam‚Äôs or Walmart.

Since I usually base our menu around proteins (as they‚Äôre one of the more expensive ingredients each week) I‚Äôll give an example of reverse meal planning for this week ‚Äúshopping‚Äù our freezer first‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

This week we‚Äôll start with steak & chicken on the grill for Father‚Äôs Day. Steak was his Father‚Äôs Day dinner choice, and we got SUPER lucky finding 4 steaks on clearance at Meijer for $13.82! We also recently found huge boneless skinless chicken breasts on sale for $2.49/lb. We fileted them into normal size portions making two smaller breasts out of each single, and will grill up two of those ($3) as well for the kids who don‚Äôt care for steak.

This is definitely a more expensive meal for us, but our goal isn‚Äôt to deprive ourselves or be super hardcore about the budget either. We were lucky to find steaks on sale, but if we hadn‚Äôt we absolutely would have bought him steak for Father‚Äôs Day either way!

The next thing I see in the freezer is a large whole ham I bought back at Easter for $0.79/lb. It‚Äôs giant and takes up a ton of room (we only have an over fridge freezer). I‚Äôll roast it, then we‚Äôll portion the meat up. I‚Äôll set aside what I need for this week‚Äôs meals & the rest will go into baggies to freeze & use as needed later. Total price for the ham shank was $6.83. We‚Äôll probably use about ‚Öì of the ham this week, so about $2.29 for the ham on the menu.

I also see a couple packages of bratwurst we got on clearance for $1.96 & $2.36 each, so we‚Äôll do those on the grill one night.

And I‚Äôll take out two pounds of ground turkey ($3.98) for Unstuffed Cabbage Rolls another night because I have a cabbage in the back of the fridge that needs to be used up.

In all, meat for this week‚Äôs meals will cost us around $27.

We will also have two vegetarian meals and our usual Friday night meal of Take n‚Äô Bake Pizza

Now I‚Äôll look at the recipes I decided on and check the pantry & fridge for any ingredients I‚Äôm missing. I‚Äôll also look for items we‚Äôre running low on while I do this. Those (plus the best sale items this week) will become my shopping list.

Being flexible and paying attention to prices are the keys to saving money with your groceries. When we transitioned to stocking our kitchen from sales & doing price comparisons before we bought items, and then added in reverse menu planning, our grocery bill finally went way down.

Was it a mistake to ask her?,"So i met my lady friend last year at a summer job. I developed feelings quickly. Just felt like someone i had good chemistry with, someone i wanted in my life. We met up for coffee a week later. And then after this was when i snooped for her on facebook and came across stuff that hinted at her having a boyfriend. There wasnt signs on instagram from when i added her.

As the months go on, we start hanging out more. We've hung out a lot recently. And guess what, she still hasn't told me directly or mentioned having a boyfriend. A fiance, no less. Long distance.

So she's leaving to another state soon. And so i felt compelled the other day when we were hanging out to finally address this. So i asked her about it, and asked why she hadnt told me.

She got defensive and said im just her film friend to talk about movies with. I guess saying theres no reason to mention her boyfriend. But she always talks to me about her sister, her family?

So after this conversation, yeah. She didnt respond back me yesterday.

She finally reached back to me just now. Everything seemed fine, we were kind of ignoring whatever was bothering us and talking about other stuff. And then i see she blocked me on facebook....

We're still good on instagram and other places.

I couldnt help but ask her about it. Like heyy i thought we were good, whats up with facebook?

and this is what she said: ""yea, i think we'll just continue to be film friends. But everything else was weird to me idk i cant, im already dealing with a lot of shit""

that could mean sooo many things. Like did she realize i do in fact like her and basically friendzoned me? or was she just weirded out and wants at least some place where we're not connected?

i didnt ask her what she meant exactly. i did tell her that if its because of what i said, that i understand. Cause facebook is the only place where she mentions her boyfriend.

we are hanging out Monday.

My point with all this is that yes, i have feelings for her and it thus made things difficult for me. I havent told her how i feel. I wanted to other day, but i dont think its a good idea anymore. She'll move soon. We'll still be friends but it will be different and i've already accepted that.

I just felt compelled to get some answers or closure before she left, instead, i ruined things a bit :(

So yeah, i guess i was officially friendzoned. She finally established that boundary after a year of not telling me she had a boyfriend lol im not looking to get out of it and like date her. Just to fix things to how it was maybe",2,1749773954.0,dating,3,1.0,False

It wasn‚Äôt just social media or YouTube. It was the constant switching, notifications, background noise, sugar, caffeine, scrolling before bed, group chats, podcasts during breakfast‚Ä¶ My brain never had peace.

At some point, I couldn‚Äôt focus for more than a few seconds. I would jump from video to article to idea, and then forget what I was even trying to do. My sleep sucked. I was tired, wired, and anxious for no reason.

I decided to test what would happen if I cut out *everything* that constantly stimulated me, but not forever, just for 30 days.

Here‚Äôs what I did:

* No social media at all
* No YouTube or short-form content
* No sugar or caffeine
* No podcasts, news, or background stimulation
* Woke up and went to bed at the same time
* Ate clean, drank water, walked, and journaled

Week 1 was brutal. I was bored, agitated, and constantly reaching for stimulation.  
Week 2 I started noticing actual thoughts returning like full, connected ones.  
Week 3 I could go hours without checking my phone. I was calm.  
Week 4 I didn‚Äôt *want* the chaos anymore. It felt like I got my brain back.

Since then, I didn‚Äôt go back to 100% clean living, but I also didn‚Äôt go back to the old chaos.  
Now I check social media maybe once a week, and even then it feels... gross. I still drink coffee, but it‚Äôs not my life source. I watch videos, but I‚Äôm not trapped in autoplay. I have space in my day now. 

I think the biggest thing I learned is that you don‚Äôt have to quit everything forever at once ,you just have to reset the baseline. Once your nervous system calms down, you stop craving the constant noise. You start choosing what you consume, instead of letting it choose you.

I still use the same basic reset principles anytime I feel like I'm slipping again like a ‚Äúsoft reboot‚Äù for my brain.

I tracked what worked and what didn‚Äôt, and wrote everything down for myself what to avoid, what to bring in, and how to make it sustainable. That later became a guide I now share with others.

I won‚Äôt go into that here unless someone‚Äôs curious but just doing one single day without stimulation (no sugar, no caffeine, no scrolling, no background noise) is eye-opening on its own.

1la25n6,https://www.reddit.com/r/countrymusic4ever/comments/1la25n6/crazy_country_songs/,Crazy Country Songs,"Welcome back to Country Music 4 Ever! Country music has so many songs that make you wonder how someone could ever come up with such a crazy story. Today I want to look at some of those songs.

The first song I want to discuss is ‚ÄúJohn Deere Green‚Äù by Joe Diffie. This song tells the story of Billy Bob and Charlene, who are high school kids. Billy Bob climbs on a water tower and paints a heart that is ten feet high and the words ‚ÄúBilly Bob loves Charlene‚Äù in a John Deere green color. The Town makes fun of him for not using red, but Charlene thinks it looks good because she‚Äôs so in love.

The next song is ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Even Know Your Name‚Äù by Alan Jackson. This song is about him going to a restaurant and sees a beautiful waitress wiping ketchup off a table. His waitress, however, was missing her front tooth and was not as attractive as the one cleaning up the ketchup. He then flags down the beautiful waitress for some coffee and tells her he loves her. He later has a bit too much to drink and proposes marriage. However, he doesn‚Äôt realize until the wedding that he actually proposed to the waitress who was missing her front tooth.

The last song I want to discuss is ‚ÄúGood Directions‚Äù by Billy Currington. This song is about him selling turnips off the back of his truck. As he‚Äôs eating a pork rind, a beautiful woman pulls up asking for directions. He then gives her directions to a little country store and tells her to go in and ask Miss Bell for some sweet tea. We later find out Miss Bell is his mom. Anyhow, he tells her a left will take her to the interstate, but a right will bring her right back to him. She then disappears into a cloud of dust, and he wonders why he let her go. But like all good stories, she comes back to him, and they live happily ever after.

I‚Äôd love to hear what your favorite crazy country storylines are. Thanks for reading. I‚Äôll be back soon!

1la24fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raypeat/comments/1la24fz/what_can_i_do_to_support_my_body_while_on_birth/,What can I do to support my body while on birth control?,"TLDR: What can I do to support my body while I'm still on the birth control pill, and to prepare to get off of it so I can minimize potential negative effects from withdrawal?

I am unwilling to come off of it now because I'm 27 and single - not because I want to have unprotected s\*x, but because I'm absolutely terrified of getting cystic acne again or gaining weight. I want to be married (and a mother someday) more than anything, and I feel like I need to be in a stable relationship before I take the risk of ruining my appearance.

Background: Been on multi-hormone BCP since 16 for cystic acne. Supposedly a ""low dose"" one. Before BCP, I didn't have any menstrual issues, or other PCOS-like symptoms, just acne, which my dad and brother also suffered from. I also took low dose spironolactone on and off from 16-26ish for acne, stopped taking that sometime last year after slowly messily tapering off, haven't noticed any bad effects.

Now I'm 27, almost 5'10"", 125lbs. I'm generally physically healthy. Yes I'm borderline underweight but I've maintained the same weight for the past 12+ years without really ""trying"" - I suppose a combination of naturally lower appetite, reasonably healthy ingrained habits, and a healthy metabolism, which I'm terrified of losing. I've never been a health nut, but I've always tried to eat sanely and over the past few years, have gradually taken my diet more and more seriously. I'm not 100% strict about it, but I try to eat as minimally processed as possible. I've been learning more and more about Peat's ideas and incorporating them into my diet. I don't exercise besides walking, but I love to walk, I try to walk at least some on most days, but many days I walk quite a bit.¬†

I don't know if I have side effects from the birth control. I've suffered from depression since I was 11-12, so I don't have a sense of a healthy normal adult baseline off of BC. I still suffer now but I'm doing significantly better and improving. I have a very high libido despite being on BC.

My mother took BC also from 15-16 with only a short break in her mid 20s. She got off of it when she was 36 to have me, and I was conceived very quickly with no difficulties. My mom went on to have my brother at 40 and my sister at 45, also without difficulty. My family is generally healthy on both sides. I'm not sure if any relatives have PCOS or fertility issues.

When I ask my mom what coming off BC was like for her, she always tells me she doesn't remember anything unusual or bad symptoms, but she is also notorious for having a bad memory.

However, my mom was 6' (in her prime) and I am 5'10"", and I wonder if being larger than the average woman, combined with favorable genetics, could insulate us from the negative effects of the BCP? No idea though.

I'm curious if progesterone while still taking BCP would be helpful? I hear so much about it, but I want to make sure I fully understand what I'm getting into before I supplement any hormones, so resources on this would be appreciated.

What else can I do? What foods are particularly helpful to minimize the damage to my body? Should I start exercising more intensively, maybe try to build up muscle mass before stopping the pill?¬†

PLEASE, please don't scare me with predictions of doom. I'm not trying to stick my head in the sand, I know about the many potential issues from the BCP, but this really stresses me out and I want to be optimistic and focus on what I can do.

ETA my general diet currently: eggs for breakfast every morning, whole milk, butter, ground beef/steak/beef shank (trying to do shank more), cheese, collagen powder, coffee with honey, fruit, baby carrots, nixtamalized corn tortillas, occasional ice cream. I make stews, curries, and chili a lot, from scratch. Non-peaty things I eat: pasta (I get non-enriched tho), bread, ham occasionally, some PUFA-containing condiments in moderation, tomatoes, berries. I do eat out but that's only 1-2 a week.

For three years, this was my morning ritual. Before my feet hit the floor, before I even remembered my own name, my phone was in my hand. Instagram, Reddit, Twitter, TikTok just the endless scroll of other people's lives while mine rotted away in bed.

I'd tell myself ""just five minutes"" and suddenly it's 9:47 AM. I'm late for work again, haven't brushed my teeth, and that sick feeling of self-hatred is already settling in my chest. You know the one like those voices that hollow shame that says *""You're pathetic. You can't even get out of bed without your digital shiny box""*

**I was a grown adult who couldn't handle 30 seconds of silence with my own thoughts.**

The breaking point came on a Tuesday morning in March. I'd been scrolling for TWO HOURS watching strangers live their lives while I pissed away another morning. My friend brought me coffee and just looked at me with this... disappointment. Not anger. Disappointment. I felt a horrid sense of feeling from that experience.

That night, I admitted something that scared me: *I was addicted.* Not to drugs or alcohol, but to the dopamine hit of infinite scroll. I was choosing pixels over relationships, strangers  I don't care about over my own life.

The first week felt like literal withdrawal. I was anxious, irritable, and bored. My brain kept screaming for stimulation. I almost gave up on day 4.

On day 8, I woke up and actually *noticed* the sunlight coming through my window. I hadn't seen morning light without a screen glare in years. I nearly cried.

**Here's how I broke free (and you can too):**

* I bought a $12 alarm clock and moved my phone to the bathroom. Sounds simple? It was torture at first. My hand would literally reach for where my phone used to be like a phantom limb. But that 10-second walk to the bathroom was enough friction to break the autopilot.
* Instead of scrolling, I started writing three pages of stream-of-consciousness thoughts. No editing, no judgment. Just brain dump onto paper. It gave my mind something to do instead of craving digital stimulation.
* For the first two weeks, I couldn't touch my phone until I'd been awake for 10 minutes. Then 20. Then 30. I worked up to a full hour. Baby steps, because cold turkey just made me binge harder.
* Every morning, I texted my best friend ""Morning check-in: Phone-free for \[X\] minutes."" Having to report my progress (or failures) made it real.

Three months later, I wake up naturally around 6:30 AM. I meditate for 10 minutes, write in my journal, and actually eat breakfast while looking out the window instead of at a screen. My anxiety is lower, my relationship is better, and I feel like I got my mornings  and my life  back.

I hope this post is helpful to you guys too. The screens are becoming way too addicting.

It's time to break free from this digital madness.

Good luck!

I first thought it was just her being a bit busy and didn't mind it at all but during the mid-flight snack service, she didn't even bother asking for my drink order until she served everyone else. I wasn't sleeping or doing anything else but listening to a podcast with my airpods on without noise cancelling. In stark contrast, the other FA who handed out snacks offered snacks to me first and insisted I take one even though I first said I didn't want any. 

During the snack service, I asked for a coke with no ice after she walked past me after getting orders for those in Row #4. When she finally stopped ignoring me, she kept asking me ""with ice?"" even though I said ""no ice"" very clearly a couple of times as if I couldn't speak any English and made hand motions. I'm a Black American and I can speak English very clearly. I want to point out that I was nothing but courteous. After she takes my order, she makes herself a coffee and sits down and doesn't even bring my drink order. The passenger in 2A got up and went to the galley telling her that I did not get my drink and she was first denying that I ordered. After the passenger in 2A said that he heard everything, she was like ""oh whoops, slipped my mind"" and then came with a coke with ice while we were starting the descent in the LGA and claimed that she said she was a bit frazzled but didn't apologize. I said I didn't want the drink as it was going to spill but she plopped it on my armrest.

I know it's just a stupid drink order and I can live without drinking a coke on a plane but I'm not that happy with what happened. I was the only black man in the entire first class cabin and was coming straight from a meeting in Montreal to immediately go to another meeting back at the office and hold SK Diamond status, to provide some context/extra info. 

On one hand, it's a really stupid thing to complain about over drink orders but on the other hand, it's annoying that I was repeatedly ignored while everyone else was properly served by this FA and she was happy to chat with everyone in F but me. I've never had a negative flight with Delta but I've never been treated this way even when I flew Royal Air Maroc or Aerolineas Argentina in J (two airlines that are not that great in service compared to Delta). 

I just don't want to be a karen as I know what it's like to deal with them having worked at McDonald's when I was back in high school years ago. Appreciate the input and comments.

1la209q,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1la209q/ive_been_taking_care_of_my_friend_since_her/,I've been taking care of my friend since her accident. She's been begging me to kill her.,"""Come on, Penny,"" The swaying oaks cast a rain of leaves around me as I climbed the forest incline. ""Trust me, the view is amazing!"" I reached a hand out, waiting for Penny to take it. She stood at the bottom, arms wrapped around herself, freckled face pinched in hesitation. Her lips pursed softly, face partially obscured through her clothes. A few gold strands framed her face, the rest tucked under her hat. ""I know you're going to love it. I promise,"" I added, trying to reassure her.

""I don't know..."" She murmured, eyeing the off-shoot path I'd led her on. Penny was, and always had, been a strict follower of rules, and one of those being that you didn't stray from the trail. ""I just... Maybe we should head back."" I frowned, lowering my hand as she started to turn around. ""It's starting to get cold out, a-and we've already been out long enough. I'm sure there are better views that aren't so, uh... dangerous?""

""Penny,"" I called, catching her attention. She turned to look at me like a dog that had just heard a whistle, eyes curious yet guarded. ""Can you at least try to trust me on this?"" I watched her eyes flick away for a second, her gloved hands curling together as she weighed her options, and finally she looked back at me with a nod.

""Okay. But just for a little bit,"" Penny finally relented, and I smiled as she finally slipped her hand into mine, and I hoisted her up with ease.

""See? No cops coming after us,"" Her already-red face flushed deeper. Her blue eyes narrowed in a glare, and she huffed, adjusting her hat. ""Kidding, kidding!"" I grinned. ""Come on. It's not far at all from where we parked."" With that, I let go of her hand and began to climb the rest of the incline.

""Aaaaaand, here we are!"" I proudly announced, hands at my hips as I stepped on the top of the hill. Though not the most impressive thing, the relatively flat nature of the forest made it a bit more special. Penny joined me a second later, brushing the raging strands of hair away from her face. She looked up, and her face lit up in awe. I grinned, following her gaze to the small clearing we now stood in. A small pond sat in the centre, reflecting the surrounding trees in a perfect mirror image. Leaves drifted down, sending ripples across the surface‚Äîcolliding, then calming again.

""Wow,"" Penny breathed. ""It's... it's beautiful.""

""Isn't it?"" I grinned, looking at her. She turned to look at me, returning a smile. ""Told you it'd be worth it."" She blushed, nodding. ""Let's go down and see the pond!"" A slope of wet leaves and pebbles stood between the edge and the clearing. Though a bit risky in terms of slipping, it wasn't anything to worry about, and I descended without an issue. ""Your turn!"" Her eyes swept the slope, calculating each pebble and patch of wet leaves as if they were traps. A shallow breath left her lips before she finally gave a small, reluctant nod.

""Okay,"" Penny carefully slid herself down the wet and muddy slope, taking meagre step after meagre step, legs practically shaking with the strain.

""See? Nothing to-""

A quiet gasp escaped her as her foot slid on loose soil. Her arms shot out, grasping for anything, but nothing stopped her fall.

The sickening crunch that followed rang through the forest, a cacophony of flapping wings and startled animals fleeing the scene. Her body lay still, limbs splayed haphazardly where they‚Äôd fallen. Her head rested against a jagged rock, neck bent at an angle no living person could survive. Blood trickled down the slope in winding streams, painting the rocks red like a river in miniature.

I froze, breath caught in my throat. I stumbled forward, crumbling to my knees. My lips parted, and an unbidden sound escaped, barely a whisper of what I had been hoping for. I swallowed and tried again. ""Penny?""

The burbling sound of water running through a nearby stream filled my ears. Birds chattered as they returned to their homes in the trees overhead, unaware and uninterested in what had happened. The world narrowed on her form as blood continued to seep out, painting the leaves like ink in water.

She wasn‚Äôt breathing.

The caw of a crow echoed overhead, tearing through the fog settling over my thoughts. I stumbled up and scooped her into my arms. ""Penny?"" I repeated, shaking her. She was weightless in my arms, any tension present mere seconds before gone. I pressed her against my chest, blood seeping through my coat. I‚Äôd dreamed of holding her before, but not like this.

""Oh, god..."" The pounding grew stronger and louder, the world spinning faster than I could process it. ""Fuck, fuck fuck..."" I looked her over with blurry eyes, chest tight with suppressed anguish. ""Y-you're going to be okay, Penny. I'll get you some help."" I bundled her against my chest, arms trembling as I carried her back the way we came. Every step up that hill felt steeper than the last, the ground dragging me down like it knew what I‚Äôd done.

I clutched her tighter as I climbed. Her blood soaked through my shirt, already cooling.

Adrenaline dragged me through the woods until the car was in sight. I threw open the door and laid Penny in the passenger seat, hands shaking as I fumbled for the keys.

""Please..."" I whispered, slamming the door and peeling onto the road. ""Hospital, hospital, hos‚Äî""

As I typed the word into the search bar, I stopped right before my finger could hit the 'L.' She was... Dead. Not by my hands, but close enough. The town would hate me‚Äîand I couldn‚Äôt blame them.

I glanced over. Penny‚Äôs head leaned limp against the window, the seat beneath her already dark with blood. She wouldn't have wanted that for me. I knew her, and she would've already forgiven me. I couldn‚Äôt throw everything away‚Äînot after all this. My hands gripped the wheel, knuckles bone white from the strain.

And so, I drove home.

I took residence in my late grandfather‚Äôs house, which he left for my family after his passing. It was close to town, but far enough away that I could live peacefully, without fear of noisy neighbours or people prying on what went on within it. As long as no one found out where I had taken her, then nobody would suspect I had anything to do with it.

The door opened and slammed shut behind me. ""Hold on, I'm going to get something to fix you up, okay, Penny? You're going to be okay."" I whispered to the corpse I carried. Kicking the door open, I hobbled to a couch and slowly lowered her on it. I fluffed the pillow beneath her head, combed her hair from her eyes with trembling fingers, and brushed my thumb against her cheek. She looked like Sleeping Beauty, her body perfectly intact and at ease. As long as I ignored her neck and the dark, purple bruises marring the once porcelain flesh around it, I could almost imagine that she was merely resting peacefully.

I left her side and began pacing the floor, trying to gather my thoughts. But the pounding in my chest made it hard to think. Still, one thought managed to persevere amongst a sea of static; I needed to get rid of the body. At the very least, I should bury it. It was the least I could do for her.

After retrieving a shovel from the basement, I ventured off into the thick grove of trees behind the house. It took me a few minutes to find the right place, a location far away enough that I could barely see my house, yet close enough that I could make it back in less time if I needed to.

As I thrust the shovel into the ground and lifted the first pile of dirt from the earth, I paused.

This was where she would rest for the rest of eternity.

I shook my head. No, it had to be more than this. It had to be more special, more fitting for such a beautiful girl. My head scanned the surrounding area, eyes landing on a bed of flowers. Red, yellow, white, and purple flowers littered the ground, swaying in the breeze. I smiled, the beauty of it reminding me of her. Raising the shovel high, I brought it down, expecting the familiar crunch of dirt beneath the metal.

Instead, I flinched as the shovel flew from my hands, knocked loose by the jarring clang of metal on metal. My brows furrowed in confusion, and I bent down to investigate. I clawed into the loosened earth until I uncovered the edge of something solid. Buried beneath was a small, black cube, no bigger than an orange. I pulled it out, wiping away the dirt.

Some of Penny's blood, which I neglected to wipe off of my fingers, had rubbed off on the surface. The crimson liquid seeped into the strange divots that covered every side of the box. I blinked, watching as the bloody droplets disappeared into the grooves. After waiting a moment, expecting for something else to happen, I was met with nothing.

A broken music box or some weird radio thing? Now it had Penny's blood on it, too. Another thing I'd need to dispose of. Pocketing the item, I kept digging until the hole felt deep enough. I stood over the grave for a few moments longer, my grip tightening on the shovel. Then, my fingers went slack, and the tool fell to the ground with a soft thud. Without another glance at the hole I'd made, I turned and headed home.

The moment I turned the handle on the back door and pushed it open, my heart stopped.

‚ÄúGhhhuuh...‚Äù

From across the kitchen, a faint gurgling noise escaped from the couch. I nearly tore the door off of its hinges as I slammed my body against it, sprinting towards the couch.

""Penny! Penny, can you hear me?"" She answered with a low, broken groan. As I rounded the corner to see her, my breath caught in my throat.

Penny's chest, which lay so deathly still just moments ago, now quaked and moved with laboured breathing, every gasping inhalation followed by a shuddering exhalation. And yet, they were the most hauntingly beautiful sounds I'd ever heard. She writhed, back arching and falling in a slow, rhythmic motion, her eyes fluttering open. One was hazy, looking past me with wistful, glossy look.

The other, however, was frozen, locked upward in a grotesque, unnatural gaze. It didn‚Äôt blink. Didn‚Äôt shift. Just stared skyward with no purpose or control.

""Penny?"" I dropped beside her, cupping her cheek. It emanated no warmth, but she was moving, and that was enough. ""Are you okay? Do you need some water?""

The sound that escaped her lips was raw, like her voice was clawing its way past a wall of thorns. A pitiful whimper, a broken moan.

I nodded, standing up and heading back into the kitchen to fetch her a cup of water and hoping, praying, that it would help her. As soon as it filled up halfway, I ran back, nearly slipping on my own feet. I sank beside her, setting the glass down for a moment as I brushed her hair from her face, letting my fingers linger just a little too long. Her lips were parted slightly, cracked and still.

Gently, I tilted her chin toward me, thumb resting on her lower lip. I picked up the glass of water and brought it to her mouth, letting the edge of the cup kiss her lips.

""Take as long as you need,"" I murmured, brushing aside the golden hair that obscured her face, the same ones I had watched her adjust and playfully fuss with not an hour ago. She choked, a horrific sound reverberating from her throat before a spray of liquid burst through the corners of her lips. The water came back wine-red, muddled by dirt and congealing blood. ""It's okay, it's okay... take it easy,"" I said, wiping the corner of her cold lips.

""It's okay. We're gonna get through this. We're okay. We'll figure something out, I promise."" She was breathing. Barely, with stilted gasps, but breathing. That meant there was hope. I just wished she wasn't so... Unresponsive. ""I promise,"" I repeated, almost to convince myself of her recovery more than to comfort Penny. It proved to be futile either way.

The ticks of the grandfather clock bore into my head, minutes passing with no change in her state. Penny just continued to take those constant gasping breaths of air, one eye peering at the ceiling and the other, forever unmoving. She made no move of her volition to sit upright, instead laying in the exact same position that I left her in.

I must've sat there for hours, listening to her faint, choking breaths. The sun had long dipped below the horizon, casting darkness over my living room and covering her face in a dark shroud. She looked... Stunning. Like an angel. A fallen one.

As the moon peaked above the trees, my eyelids grew heavy. Eventually, I forced myself to stand, legs numb and tingling from sitting so long. I carried Penny up the stairs and caught sight of the wound at the base of her neck. It hadn‚Äôt closed, but it also hadn't worsened. Just... Stagnant. I didn‚Äôt question it, as it was one less mess to clean.

""Here..."" My voice sounded foreign to me, worn and tired from the day's events. I pushed open the door to my room, carrying her to the bed and setting her down on it. She sank into the soft fabric, limbs limp and pliant, her head lolling to the side as it rested on the pillow. I pulled out the extra blankets and threw them on top of her. Maybe she was cold? Maybe that's what it was? Did the dead feel cold?

No, that was a stupid question. After all, she wasn‚Äôt dead anymore.

""All warm now?"" I brushed her hair from her face, and her eyes followed the movement, or... tried to. Only the one managed to meet my gaze. The other stayed trained on the ceiling. ""Good night, Penny. You‚Äôre safe now."" I whispered, bringing my lips to the cold surface of her forehead. Her lips twitched, parting for the slightest second to utter another choked groan.

I firmly closed the door behind me, fingers remaining on the brass knob until the coolness of the metal numbed my hand entirely. I pressed my head against the door and sighed. She was back. That was all that mattered, right?

The outside world became noise‚Äîsearch parties, missing person reports, her parents' grief. None of it mattered. The only thing that mattered was taking care of her. And that was what I did. I would be a liar if I said it wasn't rewarding. I‚Äôd wake up, check on her, clean the sheets, try to feed her soup she couldn‚Äôt swallow, watch the sun go down, whisper goodnight, and then start again.

Day in, and day out, until the cycle became routine.

It was Friday when something changed.

I got home late, the fluorescent hum of the supermarket still buzzing behind my eyes. Despite being away from Penny for eight hours, it felt like I never left her side. I saw her face on every telephone pole, heard her name whispered by every customer, and felt the pity in everyone's gaze.

But they didn‚Äôt know her like I did. They didn‚Äôt know where she really was.

She was here. Safe. With me.

I flicked on the lights, dropped my keys, and headed up the stairs. The house was still and silent, but not in the way that it used to be. Now there was another presence in it. A second body to care for. I pushed open the bedroom door and stepped inside, a smile already tugging at my lips.

""Hi, Penny. Sorry I'm so late."" My voice was a whisper, as she didn't respond well to loud noises. Either with a scowl or a whimper, both of which I hated hearing from her. I told her about my day at work, knowing this was a one-sided conversation at best. Still, it was nice to have someone to talk to. ""You're a great listener, you know that?"" I joked once I finished, and she blinked, her lips twitching at the corner.

Then, she opened her mouth.

My heart stopped. She was speaking, trying to speak. Something was clawing its way up her throat, scraping against the silence. ""Penny? What is it?"" I leaned closer, her cold breath fanning over my cheek as I hovered over her face. But then it stopped. Whatever sound she'd been about to utter died in her throat, and the moment was gone.

She went silent, staring at the ceiling once again.

I cursed silently, sitting on the side of the bed and running my hands through my hair. I'd been so close, so close to hearing her again. I looked to her, the dim lamplight casting a golden hue across her skin, the soft shadows accentuating the curve of her face, the softness in her cheeks.

""Goodnight, Penny,"" I relented, brushing my fingers against her cheek. Flicking the lamp beside her off, I turned and headed out the door. Then came the whisper of shifting fabric. Then a click. Then light.

I whirled around. Her hand fell limp, dangling over the side of the bed, and her eyes closed, serene. I, however, felt no such peace. She... Moved. I should have felt relief, but a knot of dread formed in my stomach. I closed the door and looked at the cabinet down the hall. That would definitely be enough to hold the door. Maybe I should...

I immediately shot the idea down, chastising myself for daring to think something so barbaric. I had to trust her just as she trusted me now.

And so I forced the thought away and turned on the television to help lull my sleep-addled brain into submission.

When I woke up, the door to her bedroom was ajar, the blankets tossed haphazardly over to the other side of the bed. I shot to my feet, legs stiff from sleep, and nearly fell trying to get downstairs. My eyes scanned the room‚Äîleft, right‚Äîthen caught her. Penny was halfway out the front door, a hand clutching the frame to keep herself upright. Her steps were clumsy, the result of her head drooping to the side and throwing off her balance.

Panic gripped me, and I ran.

Before she could reach the threshold, I grabbed her by the waist and hauled her up. She resisted for just a moment before collapsing in my arms like a marionette with its strings cut. The sudden weight nearly dropped us both. I kicked the door shut behind me and staggered back into the house, dragging her into the living room. I eased her onto the couch as gently as I could.

Her one good eye wandered aimlessly around the room, examining her surroundings in silence as if it was her first time here.

""Penny?"" I asked, gauging her level of consciousness. Her gentle swaying stopped, like a deer hearing a twig snap, but nothing followed. Still not a word in response. She could move, but lacked any sense of awareness. It would be... Dangerous, to leave her on her own, without someone to guide her away from danger, or from wandering off. ""Penny, we're gonna go downstairs, alright?""

A quiet, strangled breath escaped her throat in response, and I moved beside the couch.

""Up we go..."" I scooped my arms beneath her and cradled her like a bride as I descended into the basement. She didn't resist, sagging against me with unnerving pliancy. Although, this time she made an effort of keeping her head upright, unlike the last time I carried her. What I was about to do wasn‚Äôt moral. It wasn‚Äôt humane. But it was the only thing I could think of to keep her safe.

Her discomfort was a necessary price, one I would repay when the time was right.

I set her down on the most comfortable sofa, which, admittedly, wasn't much. ""Sorry,"" I mumbled, grabbing a length of rope from one of the nearby shelves. I wrapped it carefully around her waist and the back of the couch, threading it through the frame before tying it off with a loose knot. Loose enough that any true effort could undo it. That she could escape, if she ever fully came back to me.

My hands lingered near hers for a moment before I pulled back. She sat still, blank-eyed, arms resting in her lap like a porcelain doll. I exhaled, tension bleeding from my shoulders. This was fine. She was safe. We both were.

The moment she gained enough awareness to recognize the atrocity I've committed against her, I'll free her from her restraints. I would beg her forgiveness and allow her all the time she needed to recover and accept whatever fate she chose for me.

But for now, I was the only one who could keep her safe. I left the lights on, the door ajar, and even moved the television in the living room downstairs. It was a process that took a little less than an hour, but the grateful expression Penny made‚Äîone I had to partially fill in myself‚Äîmade it worth it.

I rarely slept in my own room after that, electing instead to sleep on another sofa in the basement. It was hard, dusty, and short enough that my feet hung off the edge. But I wanted to be near her. Every night, I watched the faint blue flicker of the television reflect off her face, casting shadows in the hollows of her cheeks.

During that time, she started to change. Imperceptibly, at first; a grimace when static buzzed on the screen or a small sigh at a particularly happy scene in the romcom. I was elated. My patience, and the time I spent with her, had been rewarded.

But progress was too... Fast. I couldn‚Äôt keep up.

The changes became more noticeable as the days passed. Her eye movements became more purposeful, scanning the room instead of wandering about like a drunkard. No longer did they look past me, or through me. Instead, they looked at me. Right at me.

It would only be a matter of weeks, maybe less, before she had the strength to untie herself. And then she could go... Anywhere.

Anywhere but here. Away from me.

The fear that once felt like a pinprick, a slight worry in the back of my mind, was now a gaping hole in my chest. I couldn't face it. The possibility that her first step might be towards the door instead of me.

I couldn‚Äôt imagine my life without her. The thought caused bile to rise in my throat. My legs moved before I could stop myself. I walked upstairs, into the garage, and found the old sliding bolt I‚Äôd never gotten around to using. The small, insignificant piece of metal felt heavy in my palm, rust flaking off the edges. It would have to do.

I screwed it into the door before taking a step back to admire my handiwork. It was the only thing keeping the world from her.

Just for now, I promised her in my thoughts. Just until I was sure. If she ever needed to go, I‚Äôd open it. I‚Äôd let her go.

I just‚Ä¶ needed more time.

My stomach churned as I stepped into the basement, and the flickering light of the TV washed over my face. I sat beside her, placing a gentle hand on her shoulder. She leaned into the touch, her head rolling to the side to meet my gaze. Her eyes, though unfocused, looked brighter, more alive, than they had in weeks.

""You're getting better,"" I murmured, brushing a stray lock of hair from her forehead. She opened her mouth, and I waited for the gurgling, raspy breath that always followed.

""J...""

The world stood still. Her lips moved, and I held my breath. Just as I convinced myself it was all in my head, she continued.

""...Ohn.""

She spoke. My Penny spoke.

It was the most haunting, beautiful sound I had ever heard. My heart swelled with ecstasy and hope. But when I saw her arms straining against the ropes, reality crashed back down. Her eyes met mine, and a soft whimper slipped from her throat.

‚ÄúH‚Ä¶‚Äù she rasped. ‚ÄúHelp. Me.‚Äù Her voice was broken, hoarse with disuse. Each word sounded like she was choking, each syllable dragged across gravel. Her arms strained, fingers curling against the fabric of the couch. But they were weak, and no matter how much she struggled, the ropes were too tight. ""Help,"" she whispered again, staring at me with a single, pleading eye.

""I-I know, Penny."" I stammered, forcing a smile. ""I... I can't, not yet. So... Here. Here, watch this. It's your favourite show, remember?"" I scrambled for the remote, turning on the television. Anything to distract her. But her remaining working eye never left my face. I swallowed hard, avoiding her gaze and fiddling with the remote in my hands.

""...Please."" It was so quiet that I almost couldn't hear it. And yet, the weight of that word, of the pain behind it, was enough to make my chest ache. ""John, please.""

""It'll... It'll only be for a little while. Promise."" I assured her, though the way she stared at me now was utterly unreadable. I couldn‚Äôt stand it. The desperation in her voice was unbearable, and a part of me wanted to set her free right then and there. Crimson tears spilled from the corners of her eyes, painting her lifeless cheeks red. ""Please, Penny, don't... Don't look at me like that. I can't let you leave."" I begged, desperately wiping away the seemingly endless waterfall of blood. Her gaze softened somewhat and she tilted her head slightly. Then, finally, the silence was broken by the quietest of words I had to strain myself to hear.

""K...kill me.""

""Kill-..."" I reeled back from shock and horror at the very thought, my feet stumbling over themselves. ""Kill...? Kill you?"" The mere idea felt sacrilegious. I had spent so long caring for her, hoping and praying she'd get better, and now... And now she wanted me to destroy everything I had worked towards? ""No. No, no... Penny, please... Just... Get better, and I promise I can explain everything when you get bett-"" She let a gurgling, keening wail, the loudest sound she had ever made in the last few weeks. I felt my heart drop to the pit of my stomach, and I fell silent. She just kept repeating those words.

""Kill me. Kill me. Kill me.""

I couldn't take it anymore. I shot up, slammed the door behind me, and slid the bolt shut. My head hung low, tears stinging at the corners of my eyes. I pressed my forehead against the wood. Her cry echoed in my head, worming into my ears, my skull, until they were all I could hear.

""Please..."" I whispered to no one, my nails scraping against the wood grain. ""Don't hate me."" My breath rattled in my throat, and the silence that followed was deafening. I didn't hear her again, even when I pressed my ear against the door. ""Please..."" I begged, a sob wracking through me. ""I'm sorry. I love you. Please... Don't hate me."" My words died in my throat, and I collapsed against the door, knees buckling and hitting the floor.

I couldn't go downstairs for the next 2 days, spending the most time away from her since she arrived in my home. At first it was the guilt. Then it was the fear. But finally, it was the dread that she would never forgive me for what I did. I didn‚Äôt want to see it‚Äîher face twisted in hatred, her eyes narrowed in disgust. It made it harder to imagine a smile tugging at her cold, dead lips.

When the third day rolled around, however, I found the will to enter the basement again. I pushed open the door and stepped inside, the dimly-lit room illuminated by the faint light of the television. The moment I turned the corner and entered her line of sight, her whole body stiffened, and her head snapped towards me. The movement was so sharp, so sudden, that I flinched.

""...Hey, Penny,"" I said, offering her a weak smile. ""It's been a while, huh?"" Silence. I expected that. ""How are you feeling today?""

Her eye narrowed into a scowl, but she didn't make a sound. That alone was already a blessing.

""I know you're probably mad at me. A-and you have every right to be,"" I added quickly, sitting on the ground in front of her. ""But, I promise, I'm going to make it up to you. Just... Give it some time. Get better, stronger, and then you can decide where you go."" She stared at me, the blue of her iris overtaken by a sea of white. I could barely make out the rise and fall of her chest, and the occasional twitch of her fingers.

""Hurts."" The word came like a punch to the gut, knocking the wind out of me. ""Hurts."" She repeated, more urgently this time. My eyes fell upon where the rope was wrapped, digging into the skin hard enough to bruise.

""I-I thought I was being careful..."" I muttered to myself, kneeling in front of her and reaching for the rope. ""Sorry, I'm so sorry."" I loosened the knot, just enough for her to have some wiggle room, and she let out a soft whimper of relief. ""There, better now?""

Nothing.

""You'll be out of these soon. I promise."" My fingers reached out to tuck a strand of hair behind hear ear, but she turned her head away impudently, and my hand retracted. ""Okay. Okay. I'll... I'll see you later.""

I wanted to do something for her. So, the next day I went out and bought a bouquet of her favourite flowers, sunflowers, and a small stuffed animal.

""Hey, Penny."" I called out. ""Look what I got you."" Again, I was met with little more than a scowl and a glare. I smiled weakly, setting the bear in her lap and the flowers on the coffee table. ""Do you remember these? They‚Äôre your favourites."" I brushed a hand over one of the yellow petals. ""And I know you've been a little lonely lately, so I got you a friend."" I lifted the stuffed animal and held it up to her face. The brown, plush fur brushed against her cheek, and her eye widened. ""What do you think?""

Her head tilted to the side, her gaze fixated on the toy. She seemed entranced by the toy, the first sign of emotion I had seen from her since the other day. Finally, I did something right, and she would be happy.

""John..."" But the tone in her voice wasn't one of delight or appreciation, but something else. Something that sent chills down my spine. ""John..."" Her lips parted, and a choked noise escaped her lips. Her gaze left the bear, trailing upwards with agonizing slowness until it landed upon jacket. ""John... What's in your pocket?""

My blood ran cold. I froze, my grip tightening around the bear. ""I... I don't know what you're talking about,"" I lied, too quickly. My right hand slid into my jacket, fingers curling instinctively around the cube. How she knew about it was beyond me. I had kept it hidden ever since I found it, and I was the only one who knew where it was. I was the only one who knew what it could do. So how did she know where to look? Could she... Sense it?

Her eye flickered across my features, as if absorbing every detail of my expression. ""Okay, John."" She said, her tone soft, almost disappointed. Her words were broken, each syllable pronounced with the utmost care. I stood there like a fool, the plush still clutched in my hands, unable to move. Her gaze fell back to the stuffed animal, and a faint smile graced her features. The sight made my chest tighten, but not in the way it usually did. ""Thank you.""

I swallowed, nodding stiffly before setting the bear back on her lap. ""Of course.""

It wasn't much, but it was progress. It was progress. I sheepishly left the room, the feeling of her gaze lingering on me long after I closed the door.

That night, I couldn't sleep. Every creak of the floorboards reminded me of her footsteps, and every passing gust of air sounded like her voice. She plagued my mind even when I tried to force her out, my thoughts returning to her no matter how hard I tried to resist. I tried everything, from reading to watching TV, but nothing could distract me. Soon, the sun crept over the horizon-line, and I had gone without so much as a wink of rest.

Unable to spend another second not by her side, I dragged my half-awake self to the first floor. As I reached for the handle of the basement door, a voice stopped me in my tracks. This time, without any hint of the despair that had wracked it prior.

""John?""

It was a sweet salve on my wounded mind and aching heart, and I melted at the sound. I opened the door, in order to bask in the dulcet tones of that beautiful, haunting voice. ""Y-yes?"" I asked, leaning against the frame.

""I..."" Her words were careful, measured with a practiced calmness that made my hair stand on end. But her tone was warm, at least, and the first words she spoke didn't fill me with the dread of her prior requests. ""I'm hungry.""

Hungry? The mere word made my eyes widen and I couldn't help the smile that formed across my lips. She was hungry, she wanted to eat. It was a miracle! ""Yes! Yes, of course!"" I answered, not bothering to contain the excitement in my voice.

""Just a sandwich, please."" Before she could finish speaking, I was already swinging the fridge door wide open, grabbing everything I needed to craft her the perfect sandwich. I assembled the ingredients in between two pieces of toast, cooked it, and rushed down the basement stairs holding the plate. Penny still remained tied to her chair and watched the doorway I walked through. She looked tired, and remnants of those bloody tears remained as a mark of the torment I caused, but she smiled the second she laid eyes on me.

""I hope this is good,"" I chuckled nervously, gently lifting the first half to her lips. She leaned forward, ever so slightly. Her lips parted just enough to accept the edge of the toast. And then‚Äî

A sharp jolt of pain shot up my leg.

""Ah-!"" I yelped as my knee buckled beneath me. The plate slipped from my hand, crashing to the floor in a clatter of porcelain and scattered food. I fell forward, catching myself on the armrest beside her. ""Penny?"" Her eye was wide with a mix of shock and regret, and I realized that it was an accident.

""I-I tried to lean in, but my leg... I-I didn't,"" The bashful tone in her voice made my cheeks burn, and she stared at the sandwich, a pout on her lips. ""I'm sorry.""

""It's... Okay, no harm done. I'll get started on another one,"" I peeked at the mess of broken porcelain beneath her. ""As soon as I clean that up."" I stepped out briefly to fetch the broom and dustpan. The sweeping of the shards didn't take too long, although I made careful work to not cut her. She watched me silently the whole time. Once I was done, I excused myself and rushed to dispose of the broken plate. But before I could dump the remains into the trash, I noticed something. It didn't seem like the shards accounted for the entire plate.

I gently spread the fragments on the counter and got to work trying to piece them back together. Each puzzle piece fit perfectly, one after the other, until I was left with the near-complete plate.

Except for a large, jagged triangle that was missing from its centre.

The realization set in immediately, and I dropped the porcelain back onto the counter. My heart hammered in my chest as I sprinted back downstairs, praying to whatever god would listen that I was wrong. That she was better than that.

I was wrong.

The ropes lay in a heap on the floor, loose and limp, like shed skin. A few strands clung to the frame, the knots unravelled, their purpose lost. The cushions still bore the shape of her body, the only sign that she was ever there at all.

""Penny?"" I cried out, scanning the room for her in the darkness. ""Penny, please, what's going on?"" My heart was in a panic and I peeked behind one of the shelves. Nothing. ""Penny, talk to me. Where are you? Just... Just calm down."" She had to be in here, somewhere. She wouldn't leave, right? She couldn't leave, not again. Not like this. ""Penny, please, don't do this. Don't leave me. We can work this out!""

Then came a creak from behind. I turned around and, for a moment, saw a blur of gold and blue before a searing pain exploded in my side. A sharp gasp escaped my lips as I fell to the ground, desperately clamping my hand over the location of the searing pain. My palm burned, the warm liquid seeping between my fingers and onto the floor. I staggered backwards, holding my wound shut, only to see Penny's form looming over me.

The shard gripped in her hand leaked a steady trickle of red, but from how hard she was gripping it, I wasn't sure if it was mine or hers.

Worst of all was her expression; pity. It was as if I was some wounded animal, ready to be put out of its misery.

""Penny..."" I rasped, clutching at my side. The blood stained my fingers red, warm and sticky. I felt sick. ""Please, please, don't do this."" Her eyes were empty, devoid of any emotion or remorse. She took a slow, calculated step forward, no longer encumbered by stiff joints, and her grip on the shard tightened. I tried to move away, to escape, but the pain in my side flared up, causing me to collapse to the ground with a pathetic thud.

I slammed my eyes shut and awaited for her to plunge that blade deep into my skull.

However, she instead knelt beside me and fished the object from my pocket. I didn't even try to stop her. I just watched with wide, fearful eyes as she held the cube in front of her face, her thumb hovering above the divot.

""It... It's what brought you back,"" I explained, despite knowing deep down she already figured it out. ""It's what gave you a second chance. To... To live, again. You don't deserve to have your life taken away from you just because I..."" I gritted my teeth, a fresh wave of pain shooting through my side. ""I was an idiot and kept asking more of you, even though you were scared and hurt. I should have seen it, that I was being cruel and controlling and that... You died because of me. B-but I'm trying to make things right, Penny. I just want to keep you safe.""

Her pale-blue eye left the cube for just a moment to lock with my gaze, and this time, both eyes were focused on me. There was a softness in her gaze, a hint of sorrow, that made me think that she understood. That she forgave me. That she would accept this second chance.

""You don't believe a single word of that.""

The sharp end of the shard plunged into the centre of the cube. Over. And over. And over again. Crimson droplets splattered across her face and stained her pale skin red. A faint glow emanated from the cracks, and I felt the same energy from that day, With a loud snap and an inhuman screech that echoed throughout the entire room, it crumbled into bloody ashes that trickled from between Penny's fingers.

Her body was next, dropping like a discarded doll, limbs folding in on themselves. Her breathing, her twitching, and her heartbeat, all of it ceased in an instant. The light from her eyes dimmed, and her body slumped to the floor, as dead and unmoving as it had been that day.

With my consciousness rapidly fleeing me, I could do little but lay there on my back, clutching at my bleeding wounds and letting the pain take over.

I had failed her.

I don't know how long I was unconscious for. The exhaustion from no sleep probably caused me to black out for a few hours, at least. When I finally came to, I found myself in the same spot as before. It was noticeably quieter, and the chill that hung in the air was palpable. I tried to push myself upright, but a sudden numbing pain shot through my side, and I fell back to the floor. The wound was shallow, and I wasn't sure if that was because of Penny's mercy or my own luck. Either way, I was alive, for better or for worse.

Penny.

Ignoring the pain, I shot up and looked around the room. She still lay in a crumpled heap, the same spot I'd last seen her before she‚Ä¶

My breath hitched, and I slowly made my way to her. A wave of nausea passed through me as the subtle signs of decay made themselves clear. With the artifact no longer present to keep her with me, the process was quick and merciless. I flinched away, tears pricking my eyes. Muttering a silent apology, I wrapped her body up with the sheet I used during the first night.

The hole I dug from before was still intact, and still large enough to fit her in. I placed the body inside, grabbed the shovel from where I had abandoned it, and began filling the hole. I could only dump one pile of dirt on her before I stopped, my fingers unable to hold the tool any longer.

I couldn't.

The shovel fell from my fingers, and I collapsed beside the half-filled hole, burying my head in my hands. It was too much. Too much. This aching pain in my chest that tore my heart to pieces. This agonizing, crushing weight of guilt that pressed down on my shoulders, threatening to crush me. And that loneliness. That unbearable loneliness.

I didn't want to live in a world without her. I couldn't.

I didn't bother filling the hole up. Instead, I left it as it was and dragged my aching body back into the house. The house felt impossibly empty now. Every room echoed with her absence, every shadow reminded me of what I'd lost. No one would ever be able to replace her. Nothing would ever seal the hole she'd left in my heart.

No, not ever.

I know what I have to do now, what I should've done from the beginning. To make amends, to take responsibility.

I'll join you soon, Penny.",5,1749773140.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I will put the link in the comments but I have also put some screenshots here.

All the descriptions of the items are 100% ai, and the images for the products are ai and not at all what the products are.  For example, for a rodent water bottle, it shows a dog beside a disposable human water bottle.  For any and all cages, it literally shows an ai image of a sad looking rodent in a rusty cage.  There are also some fake reviews and two fake reviewers who is am pretty sure they swapped the names of.  One says its written by ""Mike R."" With a super femme looking person as the picture.  The other says ""Olivia G."" With a pretty basic looking masc guy as the pfp.  These little mistakes make the website feel like its not meant to be published yet?  The fake reveiws are also potentially giving bad medical advice for rodents, since they are written with ai and some say they are vet technicians in the review itself.

I feel like I was enslaved...,"This is my first post here... and I‚Äôm not usually the type to talk about my life experiences, but I feel like I really need to share this one...

In the summer of 2024, I worked at a caf√© where I was scheduled 7 days a week, from 5h30 to 1h00...

The first two days weren‚Äôt even about serving customers.. I spent them cleaning the entire place from top to bottom and preparing everything for the opening. It took me all day on both days to get the caf√© in shape. Tables, floors, machines, counters, everything had to be spotless before we could open.

After that, I would wake up around 5h30 or 5h45, head to the caf√©, set up the tables outside, warm up the press machine, and have everything ready by 6h00. I handled all the work alone. I served customers, cleaned, washed the dishes, made the coffee, managed the payment for deliveries and bakeries, managed the money, and even unloaded the merchandise from the delivery trucks. I was in charge of literally everything.

The caf√© was right by the beach, in a very busy area with only a few other caf√©s around. Since it had a reputation for serving really good coffee, I had a constant stream of customers from morning until night. The pressure never stopped.

Despite that, the owner often spent his time helping his friends in the nearby restaurants instead of helping me during the busiest hours. The caf√© and the restaurants along with a sup√©rette were all part of the same villa, shared by several owners.

In the evening, the owner would finally show up, and I would still be the one helping him. I assisted with decorations, fixed lights, and helped set up bamboo roofing for the summer season, all while still dealing with customers.

At one point, he bought an oven and told me I would be baking croissants in the morning. He brought it up several times and insisted on it, but I refused. I was already doing more than enough. And right before I left, he even mentioned he was thinking of setting up an ice cream stand, so I could serve ice cream in the evening and coffee during the day. Is this person sane at this point? 

Anyways.. most days, I worked from 6h00 to around 23h00. Then I would clean the place, which took about an hour. After that, I often helped with extra tasks until 1h00. I had started at the end of June, right during the peak of the summer season.

Since I didn‚Äôt have my own place, I stayed in an empty apartment nearby with my friends who worked in the restaurants. It was the same apartment given to us for free by the caf√© owner and his co-owners. We shared the space and slept on the floor. It wasn‚Äôt comfortable, but at least we were together. Sometimes they (my friends) would call me late at night to share whatever food was left where they work (the restaurants): meat, pur√©e, drinks, anything.

For all of this, I was paid 1500 DZD per day (which he refused to raise), with payment promised at the end of the summer. I also got two ‚Äúfrites omelette‚Äù sandwiches every day, one for lunch and one for dinner. The owner told me, ""You can grab drinks from the fridge, but protect my business and I‚Äôll protect yours.""

I knew I was being overworked and underpaid. But because the owner always spoke kindly to me, gave me full access to the caf√©, and trusted me with the money, I convinced myself that maybe the effort was worth it. He also gave me a 1000 DZD bonus on my first day, although he refused to pay me daily, saying the caf√© wasn‚Äôt making much in the beginning.

In the end, I quit after 6 days. I got my full payment, but I returned the 1000 DZD bonus. I told him I didn‚Äôt want anything extra, just what I had earned..

There were way too many other issues too... If I could list them all it'd need a couple of hours üòÖ

For context, I am a university student currently living with my grandparents, one of whom is currently not diagnosed with dementia but is very much in the midst of a cognitive decline, struggling with his memory, and is an alcoholic. On top of studying, I am also working on a research project - of which I mention because I am frequently reading and working on my laptop. 

Recently it just seems like my grandfather has no awareness of social cues relating to himself. He wants me to sit and spend time with him, and gets upset if I spend time in the house but away from him. He notices if I interrupt, or if I'm not responding in conversations appropriately (because I'M BUSY) and gets upset about it.

My problem is that we've reached a point where despite me explicitly telling him that I am working, and reminding him constantly, he will. not. stop. talking to me. I understand that he wants to be social, but OH MY GOD. I literally cannot sit down anywhere in my house for more than 5 minutes without him coming to tell me something (which is usually one of the same 8 stories he rotates through, or whatever is on the news). I'm at my wits end. I have so much work to do, but I can only do it outside of my house. I've resorted to spending much of my time at coffee shops, but the only problem is part of the reason why I'm living with my grandparents is to help out around the house - which I can't do if I'm not home. 

Anyways - thanks for reading if you got this far :) I have found great solace reading so many posts here, and it has helped me have conversations with other family members and my grandmother + push for more testing regarding his cognitive decline.

Turns out your coffee is pretty average, so you're losing customers, and life is shit.


You come up with this amazing idea: reward your loyal customers and keep more of them coming back.

But then every single other coffee shop starts to offer the same thing. Now you're back to square one except you're worse off because now losing 50c on each cup. Sux.

The Liquidity Trap and the Digital Valve
How XRP Could Rewire the Economic Engine

The economy isn‚Äôt responding to the controls anymore. Central banks pull the levers, raise the rates, lower them again, but nothing seems to work like it used to. Inflation rises, markets wobble, and debt climbs anyway. Something deeper is broken. And that something is trust in the system‚Äôs core mechanics.

Interest rates were once the signal fire of monetary discipline. Now they‚Äôre just theater. When Jerome Powell admitted he‚Äôs keeping rates high because a rate cut might make Trump look good, the illusion slipped. It was never just about inflation. It was about narrative. Optics. Timing. Politics. That one moment exposed what many already felt ‚Äî the people running the machine are more concerned about who wins the story than whether the machine works.

This isn‚Äôt monetary policy anymore. It‚Äôs controlled demolition.

When interest rates are held high not to curb inflation, but to protect narratives, to punish the masses, or to corner political outcomes, what you‚Äôre seeing isn‚Äôt economics ‚Äî it‚Äôs a form of institutional theft. Silent. Legal. And devastating.

Because high rates don‚Äôt hurt the rich. They crush the working class. The borrower. The small business owner. The first-time homebuyer. They trap people in cycles of rent, interest, and delay. And all while the system prints new money for itself.

This isn‚Äôt about managing inflation. It‚Äôs about managing control.

But the issue isn‚Äôt just political. It‚Äôs mechanical. The system‚Äôs plumbing is cracked. Liquidity ‚Äî the lifeblood of global commerce ‚Äî is stuck. Trapped in outdated processes and decades-old infrastructure. Most people don‚Äôt know that over $27 trillion sits idle in nostro-vostro accounts around the world, locked in place just to make international settlement possible. That money doesn‚Äôt flow. It waits. It earns nothing. It builds nothing. It‚Äôs dead capital.

And in a world that runs on real-time data, streaming video, and AI that can trade in microseconds, it makes no sense that value still moves like it‚Äôs the 1970s.

That‚Äôs where XRP enters, not as noise, but as structure. It doesn‚Äôt need hype. It doesn‚Äôt need press. It simply works. XRP moves value instantly across any currency or asset class, without the need for pre-funded accounts or central intermediaries. It doesn‚Äôt just message like SWIFT. It settles. Final. Neutral. Global. It‚Äôs what money movement was always supposed to be.

Ripple, the company building around XRP, has already partnered with over 300 financial institutions. Their On-Demand Liquidity product cleared over $30 billion in volume last year. Quietly. Efficiently. While the old system limped forward, XRP ran beneath it like a silent river.

Even the Digital Euro Association acknowledges Ripple‚Äôs infrastructure role in the new era. And the Bank for International Settlements no longer hides its frustration. The system, they admit, is slow, fragmented, and expensive. Everyone knows it‚Äôs broken. The only question is what replaces it.

Some say XRP is too centralized. But Ripple doesn‚Äôt control the XRP Ledger. The validators are globally distributed. The ledger is public. The truth is, XRP works with or without a brand behind it. Because math doesn‚Äôt need permission.

And as all of this unfolds, a darker pressure builds ‚Äî the weight of debt. The U.S. national debt has passed $34 trillion. Interest payments alone now exceed $1 trillion annually. That‚Äôs more than the country‚Äôs military budget. This isn‚Äôt a long-term concern anymore. It‚Äôs a fuse.

As foreign buyers walk away from Treasuries and auctions become unstable, confidence in the dollar‚Äôs solvency begins to flicker. All it takes is one missed payment, one geopolitical misstep, one liquidity freeze ‚Äî and the system stalls.

That morning feels like any other.

A man wakes up, pours coffee, checks his phone. Markets are red, but nothing unusual. He grabs his briefcase, kisses his daughter on the forehead, and heads out. At the gas station, his card declines. He tries again. Then his second card. The attendant shakes his head ‚Äî system‚Äôs down. A woman at the next pump can‚Äôt pay either. Then the line behind them starts growing.

Across town, an ATM flashes Temporarily Offline. A wire transfer for a commercial real estate deal fails to confirm. Payroll systems begin flagging transactions. Not because the money isn‚Äôt there ‚Äî but because the rails it rides on are jammed.

Something broke. Something big.

A Treasury auction failed. Liquidity vanished. Risk algorithms locked the system. Interbank settlements grind to a halt. SWIFT messages go out, but no value moves. Trust, the invisible current behind all money, evaporates in minutes.

People rush to ATMs, but they‚Äôre empty. Those who still carry cash get through ‚Äî for a while. Stores stop accepting cards. Then they stop accepting bills. They don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôll clear. They don‚Äôt know what to price anything at. Gold and silver sit in drawers, useless at checkout. It‚Äôs not about value anymore. It‚Äôs about settlement.

And in that moment, the question isn‚Äôt who‚Äôs in charge. It‚Äôs what still works.

Behind the scenes, the answer isn‚Äôt printed. It‚Äôs switched on.

RippleNet corridors go live. XRP flows in seconds where fiat cannot. Institutions that once used it in test environments begin routing real settlement. Asia. Europe. Latin America. Not because someone made an announcement. But because nothing else clears.

The Black Swan didn‚Äôt announce XRP. It just made it obvious.

The system didn‚Äôt upgrade. It failed over.

And the world realized the backup was already running underneath it.

When that happens, what‚Äôs needed is not a speech or a bailout. It‚Äôs something that moves capital fast, across borders, without asking for approval. Something already functioning. Already tested.

That‚Äôs when XRP stops being a theory and becomes the circuit breaker.

Because when the machine seizes up, it won‚Äôt wait for permission. It‚Äôll reach for what works.

XRP doesn‚Äôt speak in headlines. It doesn‚Äôt need to. It was designed for this moment. To replace rusted infrastructure with precision. To turn a system of delay into a system of instant response.

Bitcoin is resistance. Ethereum is the lab. XRP is the rails.

Not loud. Just early. Just ready.

‚∏ª

TLDR
The Fed revealed interest rates are political tools, not inflation solutions. The system extracts from the public while freezing $27 trillion in idle capital. The national debt crosses $34 trillion. Interest payments surpass $1 trillion. And when the next Black Swan hits, it won‚Äôt be theory ‚Äî it‚Äôll be failure. ATMs down. Wires blocked. Trust gone. XRP won‚Äôt be announced. It‚Äôll already be on.

Not loud. Just early. Just ready.

On february of this year I took a flight from Sapporo to Tokyo in Japan Airlines, while on the air a person in front of me started to watch a movie and I got totally into it, but I can't find or remember the name.

The movie, as far as I understand, is set around the 2000s and the plot is about two friends who start suspecting that their friend is cheating on his fiancee as he starts behaving uncommonly (working extra hours, arriving home late, etc).

These two friends start to follow him around \[I dont remember how the all the movie goes since I just glinced the screen of the person in front of me\]. Towards the end, they end up following him into a bar with hostees and when his friend go to talk privately with one of the hostees the confront him.

They end up finding that his friend was not actually cheating on his fiancee, but reaching to old friends of his girlfriend in order to record audios and make a tape for their wedding.

I know it's not much info sorry. In other flight with the samer airline a few weeks later I took a photo of the japanese movies catalog. I tried reverse seach all of them and they are not the movie I described. The only one I can't reverse search no matter what I do is the one called ""Single"", Im not sure if it's the one anyway.

1la1cou,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_BigCatsAreAwesome/comments/1la1cou/my_stay_in_ayia_napa_cyprus/,"My stay in Ayia Napa, Cyprus","Here we go again, the super cute Benjamin steps, once again, out into the wide colorful world. This time, I chose Cyprus. It's an island in the Levantine Sea (the easternmost part of the Mediterranean Sea) and geographically belongs to the Middle East and therefore Asia (actually, Europe and Asia are one continent called Eurasia). It's the only Middle Eastern country I'm not afraid to visit. In the other countries, there's a strict regime that would rip my soft soul to shreds. Yes, I'm a very soft Benjamin, a gigasoftie. Men can be soft-hearted too. Cyprus has a Greek-speaking part (in the south) and a Turkish-speaking part (in the north). In 1974, the north was illegally invaded by Turkey, which makes the very soft Benjamin sad. The north sees itself as an own country, but it's not recognized internationally, therefore the north officially still belongs to the Republic of Cyprus. Cyprus is also the 10^(th) country I've been to (including my home country Austria). I actually already wanted to go to Cyprus in 2020, but that dumb corona said no. 4 years later, I had the courage again, so a new adventure took place. Get ready for cute power 'n crazy vibez.



It was the year 2024, end of October. It was autumn, I got up in the middle of the night and went outside. The taxi came and brought me to the airport in Munich. During the drive, it was getting bright, but it was overcast and rainy. As I arrived at the airport, I gave up my luggage and made my way to the gate. The security control went without any problems, I just hoped that they won't hack my brain because it's full of stuff that would drive philistines nuts. After some waiting at the gate, I got into the plane, which rolled to the runway, then rushed along the runway with full blast and finally took off. The plane flew through the clouds and then over Austria (Salzburg, Graz), Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia (Belgrade), Bulgaria and Turkey (Bosporus, Antalya) before it reached Cyprus. I could see the Bosporus and the Black Sea from the plane. Fun fact: The region around Antalya is already in the habitat of the caracal, a medium-sized wild cat species that is native to the Middle East and Africa. Also caracals are super cute. Hail wild cats! During landing, the plane flew along the south coast of Cyprus and I could see the Troodos mountains. The very soft Benjamin is impressed. Oh what a masterpiece of the Holy Mother Nature! After three hours of flying, the plane landed in Larnaca. I experienced a mini jet lag because Cyprus is located in a time zone that is one hour ahead from the Central European time. As I left the airport building, I felt I time traveled back into the summer. Suddenly, it was hot and sunny. Cyprus has a subtropical climate, so the summer lasts longer here. The taxi brought me to Ayia Napa. During the drive, I could marvel at the landscape and the coast.



As I arrived in Ayia Napa, I put my stuff into the hotel room and explored the town. Ayia Napa is fully a tourist ghetto, there's a water park, an amusement park, discotheques and stuff. I walked along the beach and could see the Cavo Greco. The most beautiful part of Ayia Napa begins after the beach, it's the wild rocky coast in the eastern part of the town. There's a rock bridge above the sea that is called the Bridge of Love and it's a masterpiece of the Holy Mother Nature. Once again, the very soft Benjamin is impressed. The sun was already setting and I was amazed by the rocky coast and the sea. So Ayia Napa isn't just concrete jungle. Yeah, I'm an ecobenjamin, am I not? There are discotheques where the party people go off (rumors say that there's even the Salty Spitoon, but they wouldn't let me in anyway because I'm too soft), and my favorite area of Ayia Napa is the natural landscape in the east. In Ayia Napa, you can also find the usual shops where you can buy souvenirs (such like drinking mugs with Cyprus pictures). You can also buy sweets and snacks (Cypriot and international), clothes, toys and other knick-knacks. I got a stylish loose fit jeans that is actually designed for women, but also suits me well. Is this Benjamin totally nuts? He's acting against gender norms. Why can't this Benjamin behave for once? Now the western world is in peril. Whatever, Ayia Napa has some stuff to offer, such like statues that tell some things about the town and its history. There are also lots of super cute cats, I also encountered black cats. The enlightenment Benjamin has to remind you that black cats are not bad luck, even if superstitious nonsense spillers see it differently. Even at the end of October and at the beginning of November, the sun really rocks, so I needed a 50 spf sunscreen for my delicate baby skin to not burst into flames. When crossing the road, you have to look to the right instead of looking to the the left because Cyprus has left-handed traffic.



I once visited the famous Nissi Beach, an artwork of nature. Due to the white sand, the water was crystal clear and azure and there's a small island off the shore that you can reach through knee-deep water. But there were many people and there was music coming out of the beach bar that sounded across the whole beach. Without the crowds, the loud music and the big hotel buildings, the beach would be even more beautiful. I spent the rest of the beach days at the beach east of the harbor. At this beach, I could spread my hippie propaganda very well. Yes, I'm a propaganda Benjamin. I wrote slogans like ‚ÄúBig cats are awesome‚Äù, ‚ÄúWolves are super cute‚Äù, ‚ÄúPraise Mother Nature‚Äù or ‚ÄúLove 'n Peace 4 Ever‚Äù into the sand at multiple places, I turned the beach into a propaganda machine. This put a smile in the face of the people who passed by and saw the slogans. Two women don't seem to be too amazed as I could read from their facial expression. Two men from Jordan however loved it and also liked wolves. They were also amazed after I told them that I was traveling alone. Some people took photos or videos of my slogans, maybe I will see them on Instagram someday. It's also likely that some philistines will gossip on the internet about what an eco hippie I am. Not only that, I also used these slogans as names of the mobile hotspot of my phone, so other people could read things like ‚ÄúIt's OK to be different‚Äù on their phone when they searched for a Wi-Fi hotspot. Yes, you can also spread your word this way. This damn Benjamin with his wholesome and flowery mindset, how dare this Benjamin? Well, I'm just a dreamer and idealist. At the beach, I also met a group of middle-aged Cypriots. They're from Nicosia, the capital of Cyprus. I told them about Austria and the nature of Austria, where I also mentioned lynxes and wolves (that are basically the Natives of Austria) and about the tourism in Austria. Both in Cyprus and Austria, the hard tourists rush into the country during holiday season to drink like crazy and get wasted. They were also impressed that I know so much about Cyprus. I also met a Romanian couple that was happy about my ‚ÄúWolves are super cute‚Äù writing. They love wolves, dogs and (wild) cats too. They had a son with them who was very shy. I told them that I was also extremely shy as a kid and hardly talkative and that my personality evolved slowly and I became less and less shy, so I could give them some hope. Swimming in the sea in October and November and eating a lunch snack at the beach bar with reggae music is something special to me, I had the feeling that I got teleported to Jamaica. I also was fascinated by the alternation between rocky coast and sand beach, that seemed so magical to me. Blessed be the mystic energy.



In the evening, I enjoyed the sunset and the evening mood at the rocky coast, then I roamed through Ayia Napa and ate a delicious meal at one of these taverns. I wasn't interested in the discotheques (techno isn't really my kind of music), but I discovered a bar that played rock and metal (the name of the bar is ‚ÄúAsylum rock bar‚Äù), where I enjoyed a beer and some Cypriot booze. I had a conversation with a young woman from Greece. She loves wolves and wild cats too. I also showed her a photo of my cat that accompanied me in my life for 19 years and that I still miss. After roaming in the town, I returned to the hotel room to enjoy the rest of the evening with some Cypriot snacks. While the hard people flipped out in the clubs, I sat in my safe space and enjoyed being alone. Such an introverted Benjamin.



Regarding food, there's English cuisine (due to the many British tourists), Asian restaurants, schnitzel, McDonald's, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Pizza Hut. But I couldn't resist to try Cypriot (and Greek) cuisine. I got to know some new favorite dishes like sheftalia, koupepia, kleftiko and stifado. Cyprus is also known for that delicious grilled cheese called halloumi. At the beach, I enjoyed a halloumi pita snack. At the shops, I looked for Cypriot, Greek and Turkish snacks and found loukoumi (a Cypriot delight with powdered sugar), pastellaki, halva, kataifi und baklava. I also recommend kefalotyri cheese. I trank Cypriot beer (KEO and Leon) and Cyprus coffee. I also loved to devour olives, calamari, shrimps in garlic butter sauce and dates and I found a new favorite ice cream flavor: masticha ice cream. My other favorite ice cream flavors are coconut, mango, pineapple, passion fruit, melon, kiwi, pistachio, tiramis√π, panna cotta and amaretto. Yes, this Benjamin isn't really normal, eats such foreign stuff, such a Benjamin. But I can only recommend to try that stuff, maybe people will get to know some new favorite dishes or favorite snacks. They're so delicious, their taste is balm for my soul. I also recommend pita bread with tzatziki or olive paste. So many stuff that makes the very soft Benjamin happy.



I took part in a trip that went to Paphos. On the way there, I saw Curium, an ancient Roman city with 1500 years old mosaics and buildings. And the very soft Benjamin is impressed again. I learned something about the history of Cyprus and the Roman rule. I also got to see Aphrodite's Rock. In the Greek mythology, this rock is the birthplace of Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Near the beach, there's a small store where I bought a black cat figure with colorful butterfly patterns as souvenir, then it went to Paphos where I saw the medieval castle (a former byzantine fortress) and roamed along the promenade and the alleys. There are many hotel buildings.



Right at the next day, I joined a jeep safari that went through the Troodos mountains. Early in the morning, the driver picked me up with is jeep, there was already a family from the Czech Republic sitting in it, so basically neighbors of me who resided in Protaras at the east coast of Cyprus. The driver is also half Czech and half Cypriot (and quite crazy, but still not even near as crazy as me). The drive was 400 km altogether, and this on such a small island. The drive went from Ayia Napa into the hinterlands, you could see Nicosia in the far and the Kyrenia mountains behind it. We drove towards west, north of the Troodos mountains, where you could see the north coast of Cyprus, then it went towards south through the Troodos mounains. We drove through a village and in front of us, a car dragged two pipes along the road that were like four meters long. We laughed and the driver said that it's normal in Cypriot villages, people are a bit more chill there. We stopped at multiple villages where we could see churches, mountains and old buildings. In a village caf√©, old people where sitting there and enjoying the day. We also saw a former strip mine that was already abandoned for decades. Meanwhile, the stip mine is covered with trees again. The Holy Mother Nature basically rebels against destruction and regenerates itself. You can also see it on animals that got hunted to near extinction by nature haters (such like lynxes and wolves in central Europe or tigers in Asia that are returning into their former habitat). Further up in the mountains, it was getting cooler and the vegetation changed, it turned into that typical autumn landscape and it partially looked like my homeland Tyrol. The drive was full of action because it went along tight and rough roads, it was like a ride on a rollercoaster. You wouldn't be able to drive there with a regular car, but the jeep aced the drive without any problems. We stopped in a mountain village called Pedhoulas to visit a tavern. I ordered some soup with halloumi and couscous and koupepia (mint leaves that are filled with rice, meat and tomato sauce). Then I topped it with a cup of Cyprus coffee. I talked with the Czech family about Cyprus and the natural beauties the island has to offer. Also we stopped at a waterfall with a pond that was located in a mountain forest. When I looked up, I was amazed by the beauty of the colorful trees. I felt the nature vibes the trees were radiating. I hugged a tree and took a photo of it. The forest is my church and I pray by hugging trees. The fox is my spirit animal (foxes are also native to Cyprus). Oh Benjamin, when will you finally behave? We visited a winery to taste Cypriot wine, then the drive went on along country roads. We left the Troodos mountains and drove by Larnaca towards east. In Protaras, I said goodbye to the Czech family. They said that I'm special and that they will miss me. The very soft Benjamin is flattered. Then it went to Ayia Napa, where I also said goodbye to the driver. This was one of the most exciting days in my life, I will never forget the rough drive through breathtaking landscapes, mountains and forests.



At one day, I decided to take a bus ride to the easternmost part of Ayia Napa, the Cavo Greco National Park. That majestic rock is another masterpiece of nature. On the top of Cavo Greco, I had a wide view over the natural landscape and over the sea. There were also a few people up there who were enjoying the view or doing a picknick. After I enjoyed the view, I decided to slowly hike towards west. I was pretty much alone, just saw other hikers here and there. But I didn't feel unsafe. You only need to be careful here due to the partly high and steep cliffs (don't go too close to the edge) and it's also recommended to bring sunscreen and enough water with you. I walked through a desert-like landscape. It was very quiet, I only heard the waves of the sea and the wind. Only nature sounds, and this in such a hard party hotspot called Ayia Napa. I could take a video of the landscape and the coast before the party boats passed by. You can find this video in my YouTube channel. Just type ‚ÄúKnuffiger Benjamin‚Äù into the YouTube search, then you will find my nature content. After a good hike, along different sand beaches and rocky coasts, I was approaching the town of Ayia Napa. I encountered two Dutch women who also enjoyed their time in Cyprus and were quite impressed after I told them that I hiked the whole way from Cavo Greco. After another kilometer, I reached the harbor and I was quite amazed after I looked back to Cavo Greco in the far and thought that I was standing up there two hours ago. I'm a wanderbenjamin. After that, I enjoyed a pita gyros snack.



My last trip went to the capital city Nicosia, which is located inland. I roamed through the old town. I even went over to the Turkish-speaking part. I had to go through two passport control, one on the Greek side, then across the Green Line and then the second passport control on the Turkish side. It all went without any problems. On the Turkish side, I also found old town alleys and some kind of bazar, but the vendors weren't pushy at all. Everything is written in Turkish here, but the people also speak English. After I went back to the Greek part, I viewed even more old town buildings and took a seat at a cozy old town caf√© to sip some Cyprus coffee. I need my caffeine dose. Then I devoured some Greek pastry at a bakery. Nicosia is a very big city, at least to me as a countrybenjamin.



I enjoyed the last days at the beach, then I headed for the airport in Larnaca to return into my homeland. After the usual procedure of passport control, security control and waiting at the gate, I entered the plane. During the flight, I thought about the time I've spent in Cyprus and all the things I've experienced there. I thought it was a shame that the vacation was already over, but I was also thankful for the good time I've had. I met some super cute peeps, saw some majestic landscapes and tasted some delicious food. I caught up for the summer that I missed due to work. However, I realized that there was rubbish lying around in the landscape of Cyprus because people throw their trash on the ground carelessly, this is super uncute. Awareness needs to be raised (be it among tourists or locals) that we shouldn't treat nature with so much disrespect. Three hours later, I landed in Munich. I was quite stunned when the weather was suddenly way cooler. Only a few hours ago, I still had summer weather. The taxi brought me back to my home town, and so this adventure full of magic, impressions and emotions ended. Oh what an emotional Benjamin I am.



Now let's count what this Benjamin has done wrong:



* He acts against gender norms and general societal norms.
* Finds animals like wolves and wild cats super cute (and not only that, he also loves other unpopular animal species like snakes, sharks, slugs, Komodo dragons, blindworms and earthworms).
* Eats all kinds of exotic stuff.
* Is enchanted by nature and hugs trees instead of going into the discotheque.
* Writes idealistic slogans at the beach instead of chasing women.
* Prefers to swim in the sea instead of swimming in the pool.
* Sits on the balcony alone instead of going into the crowd.
* Hums cringe melodies.
* Grins like he's plotting something evil.
* Can't stand stress.



Yes, this Benjamin is really not normal, his mere existence already lets the upright citizens boil with anger. So it's no wonder that he got declared a troublebenjamin. But this has also a good thing because as long as they are hunting for this Benjamin, other creatures like lynxes or wolves aren't in their firing line. He directs the attacks towards himself, a true guardian Benjamin. They will never get him.



Finally, I would like to say I've spent a relaxing and exciting time in Cyprus. I fled the daily routine and could be fully myself with my sunny mind, my idealism and my soul vibes, and this in Ayia Napa, which is considered a hotspot of the hard checkers. Instead of eating normally, I enjoyed dishes that were completely unknown to me, dipped pita bread in tzatziki and olive paste and got to know new tastes. Cyprus is likely the only Benjamin-friendly country in the Middle East and one of the few Benjamin-friendly countries in the world. In most countries of the world, my soft soul wouldn't survive because they're too conservative and traditionalistic (and often also totalitarian), and I'm an abnormal, freaky and rebellious Benjamin. I'm thankful to live in a country like Austria where I can express myself freely and be my authentic self without having to fear for my life. However, there are signs that give hope that the world will slowly but surely change for the better. We dreamers will never give up to break the chains of fascism and head for a more wholesome world. The healing Benjamin already has inspired some people and given them hope during his life. Oh dear, I'm rambling again in such an idealistic and playful way. It will be interesting where my next journey will go. In the meantime, I will wander in the forests in my homeland and spread my message.



May the Benjagenda embrace the whole world.

I work at a neighborhood cafe so we get lots of regulars and gaggles of little/teenage girls. I came into Starbucks wanting to learn more about coffee but this is not the experience I wanted. Since training I've mostly been taking orders, warming food, and taking out trash and stocking. It's just feeling too fast foody and like a colossal waste of my time.

I've gotten perhaps 2-3 hours in total of bar time since my training, and despite having lots and lots of questions, I think I'm doing pretty good. It's hard though, because I quickly get booted off once it becomes busy, which in part I understand.

I'm not feeling fulfilled or like this job is serving a purpose for me. Perhaps that was my mistake for accepting a fast food cafe job. 

I'm thinking about sticking it out until end of summer and finding another job that's more relevant for me. I want to make sure that I don't quit out of fear, though.

I just wanted to vent. Has anyone had a similar experience?",1,1749771193.0,starbucksbaristas,3,0.6,False

1la1aia,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1la1aia/ro_til_death_does_us_part/,[RO] Til Death Does Us Part,"    When Elijah saw Mason for the first time it was like he was in awe. The soft glow of the autumn sun on his skin with the wind blowing in his hair made his beauty seem godlike. The wind smelled of woodsmoke and promises, and the world seemed unusually still as if time had stopped to bear witness. Mason was sitting alone on a blanket in the grass, reading a worn looking novel. His fingers, long and ink-stained, gingerly traced the pages like a lover memorizing every curve. Elijah didn‚Äôt believe in fate, but something in his chest stirred like he recognized the man in front of him, something ole, aching, and real. 

	They fell in love fast, like how a stream becomes a river, first slow and calm and then rushing towards the sea as riding the current as you go. Through whispered confessions over coffee, secret kisses in their parents homes, and the gentle folding of laundry in shared silence, they built a life that wasn‚Äôt perfect but it was perfectly and uniquely theirs.  

	Years passed like turning the pages too quickly, never being able to fully understand and feel the messages the story is trying to teach you. 

	Now, in a hospital room filled with sterile light and the light beeping of monitors, Elijah sat beside Mason once more. His hand rested on Masons, he could feel his pulse flutter like a moth against glass. The cancer had come quietly like a mouse, but took everything quickly like a blazing fire. Mason's weight, color, and breath had all changed dramatically due to the effects. Yet even now Mason's eyes still held the same light from the autumn day. Yes dimmer but not extinguished.

	‚ÄúDo you still love me?‚Äô Mason whispered, voice raspy and weak. 

	‚ÄúAlways,‚Äù Elijah replied, brushing Mason's hair out of his face. ‚ÄúEven when the last star burns out.‚Äù

	Mason smiled, and for a moment they were twenty-two again reckless, carefree, radiant, and invincible. Love had not only saved them from pain but it gave them meaning.

	As the final breath slipped like a mist between parted lips, Elijah pressed his forehead against masons. With tears in his eyes he whispered the vow they‚Äôd once made in secret, because the law had not yet seen them:

	‚ÄúTill death does us part‚Äù

	But even death knew, they would never be enough to part them.

	The funeral was small and intimate. Mason had never cared for fanfare, and Elijah honored that, even if every nerve in his body was screaming for more, more people, more time, more Mason. A soft rain began to fall on the cemetery as if the sky too was mourning. Elijah stood with a trembling hand clutching Mason's favorite shirt, the one he had worn all the time no matter the season or weather. He hadn‚Äôt washed it, he couldn't bear himself too, it still smelled faintly like Mason‚Äôs soap and cologne he had bought in a small french store downtown. 

	When the final handful of earth hit the coffin, Elijah didn‚Äôt cry. Not yet. Grief was still curling inward, like a giant wave preparing to crash on the shore. Instead he whispered one final promise letting the wind carry it away.

	‚ÄúI‚Äôll carry us both.‚Äù

	The days that followed came in slow, painful waves. Friends checked in, neighbors brought meals. The house-Their house- stood still in the middle of it all, filled with shadows and echoes of what was. Elijah would catch himself reaching for Mason's toothbrush, turning to ask him a question, setting two plates instead of one. Every room was a memory. Every room was a wound. 

	He started writing letters that would never be sent. They pilled up in a wooden box in their bedroom. 

Dear Mason, 

I still wake up expecting to find you in the kitchen, humming off-key and burning the toast. I still reach for you in the dark, forgetting, for one perfect second, that the bed is too quiet now. 
It‚Äôs strange how love stays behind when a person goes. You‚Äôd think it would fade, soften, dissolve. But ours hasn‚Äôt. If anything, it‚Äôs grown heavier. Not in a way that drags me down, but in a way that keeps me grounded, reminding me that what we built was real.

You once told me that love is like water. Always moving, always reshaping. At the time I didn‚Äôt understand. But I do now. We began as a gentle stream, remember? Careful touches, shy smiles, holding hands when no one was looking.  We didn‚Äôt know what we were becoming, We only knew that it felt right. But love has current, and ours pulled us forward until it became a river. Bold, unrelenting and wide enough to hold everything: our joy, our fears, our shared life. 
Now I sit on the banks of that river, and even though you are no longer beside me, I still hear the water rushing. I still feel you in the air, in the wind that brushed my cheek the way your hand once did.

I miss you. I love you. I carry you with me, not as a ghost, but as a part of everything I am now.
And when my time comes, I hope I find you on the other side of that river waiting.

Till death did us part-and even then, not really.

Forever Yours,

Elijah

	On the first anniversary of Mason‚Äôs death, Elijah returned to the park where it all began. The sun was setting warm and golden.

	He closed his eyes and whispered, ‚ÄúYou kept your promise.‚Äù

	And somewhere, carried on the hush of the autumn whined, he felt it: a presence. A touch.

	So did you.

	The years passed softly, like turning the pages of a well loved book. Elijah aged gently, alone but never lonely, not really. He filled the quiet with music Mason had loved, watered the plants they once joked about naming, rereading the poems that Mason had dog-eared. Time moved in slow, thoughtful waves. And Elijah, like a stone polished by a river's flow, became smoother, quieter, and more certain.

	One morning, the light came in softer than usual. The world was still, bathed in gold. Elijah sat in his favorite chair by the window, Mason‚Äôs shirt folded neatly in his lap. He closed his eyes to rest and didn't open them again.

	There was no pain. No fear.  Just Warmth,He felt weightless, as if he were floating downstream, carried by a gentle current. The air smelled like lilac and rain. There was sound too, laughter, familiar and full of sunlight.

	And then he saw him.

	Mason stood at the edge of the water, looking just as he did the day they met: eyes bright, hair tousled by wind, and a smile that could stop time. He opened his arms without a word.

	Elijah ran to him, young again, whole again. Mason caught him like no time had passed at all. They held each other for a long moment, not speaking, because there was nothing that needed to be said. Everything has already been written in the spaces between their lives. When they pulled apart, mason took his hand,

	‚ÄúYou found your way back,‚Äù Mason whispered, tears in his eyes.

	‚ÄúI never really left,‚Äù Elijah replied.

	They turned together and walked toward the horizon, where the river widened into something shimmering. It wasn't the end.

	It was the beginning of forever.

	And this time nothing would part them.

	Not time.

	Not death.

	Nothing.

‚òï[Tip Jar](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29) I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I‚Äôve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page. Never expected, always appreciated ‚ù£Ô∏è (P.S. if you‚Äôre having trouble getting to the ‚Äúcheckout‚Äù page, you might need to turn off content blockers on your phone.)",24,1749771106.0,Minneapolis,1,0.93,False

My heart says this would be the last knife I would purchase, it's perfect....but...will that last?  What is everyone's opinion on the ""last knife"" concept, is that possible?  Just some coffee talk...",3,1749771044.0,EDC,6,0.67,False
1la18v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1la18v3/dating_advice/,Dating advice,"Hi, I met a girl online and we've been talking pretty good. For about 2 weeks now, and Tuesday we went on a nice date. We got along really well, great banter, humorous fun and flirty and equally awkward! Literally felt like something out of a movie. we stayed and talked at the restaurant until closing. After we got ""kicked"" out of the restaurant, we hugged and she gave me a flirtatious kiss on the cheek.(or so it seemed that way) that has never happened to me before at the end of a first date. Ever. We agreed we both wanted to go on a second date.

But heres where my request for advice comes in. Because I dont want to blow it with this girl. I wanna make sure im not getting in my head and thinking the worst. 

Yesterday and today she has barely been chatty, and it seems like the vibes are off. I see she's online, every so often, but will not open my messages and leave me unopened for hrs. Im a little worried she may have lost some interest in me. Which is fine, but I dont really want to ask her yet... because she agreed to a second date. And she wants to do a cute date, which i brought up casually and I had no response to it when I did. Then I got off work early today, brought it up again, as like a hey im off early, if you wanna grab a coffee and do our date.  But the message was never opened. As of posting this its still on delivered. But im not trying to be pushy either. I dont want to scare her away. Lol

Anyway, im gonna patiently wait for her response back.. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Do I wait it out or call it quits? I know people get busy and stuff which is fine. But I have a bad habit of getting in my head. (Ive been working on it) 

Also I know this girl doesn't owe me anything, or quick messages. Her bio did say she was a bad texter. But If it was just meant to be a great date, then I got super lucky, and It gave me a huge confidence boost. Otherwise ill take the loss. The dating scene is hard! I am usually never this lucky! Thats why im posting. 

Hope this makes sense",1,1749771002.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

1la1794,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1la1794/i_think_cigarettes_are_slowly_killing_me_and_i/,"I think cigarettes are slowly killing me, and I don‚Äôt know how to stop","I‚Äôm 26 years old. I‚Äôve been smoking for 7 years. Right now, it‚Äôs 10 to 12 cigarettes a day‚Äîalmost without thinking. Some days more‚Ä¶

I wake up and light one. I make coffee and light one. I take a shower, light one right after. Before work, after lunch, while watching a show, talking on phone, trying to think‚Äîit‚Äôs all tied to a cigarette. Smoking has become a part of everything I do. Every time I try to quit, I come crawling back. And each time, I hate myself a little more for it.

I‚Äôve started to feel it in my body. I can‚Äôt smell or taste much anymore. I get winded walking across the street. My skin has worsened. My chest feels hollow when I haven‚Äôt smoked in a few hours‚Äîlike something inside is caving in. I gave up soccer, a sport I loved, because I just couldn‚Äôt keep up anymore.

For the past two years, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve been slowly sinking. I‚Äôm sad almost all the time. I feel tired even after a full night‚Äôs sleep. I try to be social, to show up in life, but it takes everything out of me. So I just don‚Äôt go out anymore. Lost the few friends I had made. I don‚Äôt feel joy. I don‚Äôt feel proud of anything I do anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm just going through the motions while something inside me is breaking.

I‚Äôve tried to build a good life.On paper, my life probably looks the most ideal.  I just finished my Master‚Äôs at Georgetown University - Valedictorian. I‚Äôve done well in cybersecurity‚Äîpublished papers, won a few awards. I‚Äôve tried to do everything right. But none of it has filled the emptiness. Nothing has made me feel okay. And I don‚Äôt say that to brag‚Äîhonestly, I say it because it scares me that even ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù doesn‚Äôt make this emptiness I feel go away.

I‚Äôm lonely. I don‚Äôt have a real support system. I don‚Äôt have friends. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. And the truth is, I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm scared that this version of me‚Äîthe one who smokes through every emotion, who isolates, who‚Äôs slowly giving up‚Äîmight be the one that sticks.

I want to quit smoking. I want to feel something again. I want to believe there‚Äôs still a version of me who can be healthy, who can breathe deeply, who can feel peace.

I never thought I would ever be writing something like this or doing something like reaching out for help. The ‚ÄúAIfa male‚Äù in me didn‚Äôt think I needed help. But here we are. If you‚Äôre out there and you‚Äôve felt like this‚Äîor made it out‚ÄîI‚Äôd be grateful for anything. Advice. Encouragement. A story. Just‚Ä¶ something to remind me I‚Äôm not completely alone in this. :)",6,1749770877.0,stopsmoking,6,1.0,False

Hello, selling off some pens and ink I don't use; trying to narrow my hobbies down. Would ideally like to sell all of this as a bundle, the stand is included as part of the bundle - I'll also throw in a Robert Oster sampler I have sitting unused.

**Shaeffer -** Coffee Limited Edition, M. Barely used this tbh, never felt comfortable in my hands but it was always nice to look at so its still in excellent condition. I have some Colorverse Coffee Ink in it still; honestly still full. Comes with full packaging, two ink refiils and the converter.

**Lamy** \- Safari, Clear Demonstrator Edition, F. Has seen more use at the office, but hasn't been since I picked up a TWSBI Mini for pocket use so I can just keep it one around for court work. Not that beat up, but obviously not new looking. Has some Colorverse blue ink left in the converter.

**Pilot Ink** \- Iroshizuku Three Pack. Barely used; plenty of ink. I'd say over three fourths full still, closer to full than not. I just ended up using my Coffee ink for all of my pens lol..

To recap, Shaeffer, Lamy, Pilot Inks x3, with stand and ink sample as freebies.

1la14fb,https://i.redd.it/9wuwdmzjyk6f1.jpeg,How Central Banks Will Tackle Inflation and Interest Rate Challenges in 2025,"Inflation is Not Just a Headline‚ÄîIt‚Äôs in Our Rent, Our DMs, and Our Grocery Carts

So let‚Äôs talk about something that‚Äôs bigger than just the numbers scrolling across CNBC or that one econ prof‚Äôs rant on TikTok.

Inflation isn‚Äôt this abstract monster‚Äîit‚Äôs your iced coffee hitting ‚Çπ450 in Delhi, or rent jumping $300 overnight in Austin. It‚Äôs your weekend plans getting canceled because Uber surged and your paycheck didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs personal. It‚Äôs exhausting. And it‚Äôs messing with everything from savings goals to dreams of buying property before 35.

2025‚Äôs economic vibe is murky. Central banks are still catching their breath post-pandemic, post-supply chain chaos, and now‚Äîpost everything-just-got-way-more-expensive. So, how are they planning to fix this? Are interest rates gonna stay sky-high? Are they even working? Are central banks in their ‚Äúwe got this‚Äù era, or are they winging it like the rest of us?

Let‚Äôs break it all down‚Äîno jargon, no lectures. Just clear, people-first answers that actually hit.



Monetary Policy Shifts: How Central Banks Are Adapting in 2025

üîß What monetary policy tools will central banks prioritize in 2025?

The old-school toolkit‚Äîinterest rate hikes, open market operations, forward guidance‚Äîyeah, it‚Äôs still around. But in 2025, central banks are remixing their strategy like a Spotify DJ who knows the crowd‚Äôs tired of the same beat.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs rising:
	‚Ä¢	Quantitative tightening 2.0: Instead of hoarding government bonds like collectibles, banks are actively offloading them to mop up excess liquidity.
	‚Ä¢	Interest rate corridor fine-tuning: They‚Äôre narrowing the space between the policy rate and deposit/lending rates to increase control.
	‚Ä¢	Dual mandate balancing: Central banks are starting to care about unemployment again‚Äînot just inflation. That‚Äôs new.

Basically, they‚Äôre trying to chill the economy without nuking it.

Real talk: A friend who works at a fintech startup told me their entire hiring plan got iced because their VC investor thinks rates will stay punishing until late 2025. The cost of capital is the new villain, and central banks are rewriting the rules of the game.



üß≠ Are inflation targets being redefined to reflect post-pandemic realities?

Short answer: kind of. The classic ‚Äú2% inflation target‚Äù isn‚Äôt dead, but it‚Äôs no longer the holy scripture it once was.

Post-COVID, central banks are recognizing that:
	‚Ä¢	Supply shocks aren‚Äôt temporary‚Äîthey‚Äôre becoming cyclical.
	‚Ä¢	Climate disruptions make price stability harder.
	‚Ä¢	Gen Z and Millennials don‚Äôt care about abstract inflation‚Äîthey care about rent, food, and fuel.

So, we‚Äôre seeing a shift toward flexible average inflation targeting (FAIT). That‚Äôs nerd-speak for ‚Äúwe might let inflation run hot for a bit if the economy needs breathing room.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs risky. Let it run too hot, and affordability crumbles. Let it cool too fast, and growth tanks.



ü§ù How will coordination between fiscal and monetary policy impact rate decisions?

This is where it gets spicy. In 2025, monetary policy isn‚Äôt acting alone. Governments (fiscal policy) are spending big on green energy, social welfare, and tech infrastructure. That‚Äôs pumping demand‚Äîsometimes clashing with central banks trying to slow things down.

So instead of working in silos, there‚Äôs a low-key alliance forming:
	‚Ä¢	Central banks drop hints in speeches. Then fiscal policymakers adjust budget plans.
	‚Ä¢	Behind closed doors, they‚Äôre syncing timelines‚Äîlike planned tax cuts happening after interest rates peak.

The goal? Avoid a scenario where rate hikes are trying to cool the party, but fiscal spending is out here pouring shots.



ü™ô What role will central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) play in monetary control?

CBDCs were the theoretical hot topic in 2020. In 2025? They‚Äôre real, and they‚Äôre starting to matter.

CBDCs give central banks direct access to consumer-level data and control. Think:
	‚Ä¢	Instant stimulus payments through digital wallets
	‚Ä¢	Real-time tracking of spending habits
	‚Ä¢	Potential for programmable money (yes, they can set expiration dates on funds üëÄ)

It‚Äôs controversial, but central banks see CBDCs as a precision tool‚Äîespecially when they need to stimulate spending in one sector without flooding the entire economy.



üí° Insight Drop: ‚ÄúThe Price of Tomorrow‚Äù by Jeff Booth ‚Äì Chapter 7: The Monetary Illusion

‚ÄúTechnology is deflationary. Fighting it with inflationary monetary policy is like running uphill in flip-flops‚Äîpossible, but reckless.‚Äù

Central banks in 2025 are finally starting to get this. They can‚Äôt just keep printing money to patch structural gaps. The new game is about agility, not brute force.


Inflation Forecasting and the Data Behind the Decisions

Okay, let‚Äôs get into the guts of it. Behind every rate hike, every ‚Äúwe‚Äôll monitor the situation closely‚Äù press release, and every shocking CPI headline‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs data. A lot of it. But here‚Äôs the kicker: not all data is created equal, and in 2025, the models that central banks use are finally catching up to the real world (kind of).

We‚Äôre talking machine learning, high-frequency spending data, and indicators that didn‚Äôt even exist five years ago. Let‚Äôs peel back the curtain.


üìà What inflation models are central banks using to forecast in real time?

Central banks used to rely heavily on lagging indicators‚Äîstuff like the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is basically the equivalent of checking yesterday‚Äôs weather to plan tomorrow‚Äôs outfit. Cute, but useless in a storm.

Now in 2025, real-time modeling is finally having its moment. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the new mix:
	‚Ä¢	Nowcasting models: These use real-time inputs‚Äîretail scanner data, UPI payment volume, logistics movements‚Äîto project inflation days or even hours ahead.
	‚Ä¢	DSGE 2.0 (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium): The nerdy old model just got a neural network upgrade. It‚Äôs still deeply theoretical, but better at accounting for shocks.
	‚Ä¢	Hybrid AI frameworks: Think GPT-style models, but trained on energy prices, weather patterns, and even X (Twitter) sentiment to detect price pressures early.

The goal? Shorten the feedback loop between real-world signals and policy response.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered why central banks are always ‚Äúbehind the curve,‚Äù it‚Äôs because their vision was blurry. In 2025, it‚Äôs finally getting HD.



üßæ How are wage growth, housing costs, and energy prices affecting core inflation?

Let‚Äôs break this down like a group chat rant after payday:
	‚Ä¢	Wages: Paychecks are rising in tech, healthcare, and skilled trades‚Äîbut not fast enough to match rent hikes. Central banks see this as a wage-price spiral risk, but workers just see it as survival.
	‚Ä¢	Housing: Rent is inflation‚Äôs most stubborn beast. With global housing shortages, even a 1% rate tweak doesn‚Äôt dent price pressure in urban areas. Central banks are watching rent data obsessively in 2025‚Äîespecially across cities like London, Singapore, and Bengaluru.
	‚Ä¢	Energy: Oil‚Äôs no longer the single king. Volatility in renewables, gas, and even battery storage is creating wild swings in utility costs. That‚Äôs reshaping how ‚Äúcore‚Äù inflation is defined.

For real people, this means inflation feels worse than the official number. And honestly? They‚Äôre not wrong.

A friend of mine moved out of Mumbai this year because his rent jumped 40% in 18 months‚Äîeven though inflation was ‚Äújust‚Äù 5.8%. This is what economists miss. Lived inflation hits harder than printed stats.



üîç What new data sources (like real-time consumer spending) are influencing rate moves?

This is where things get futuristic. Forget delayed economic reports‚Äîcentral banks in 2025 are tapping:
	‚Ä¢	Banking APIs to track anonymized spending patterns across millions of accounts.
	‚Ä¢	E-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart for instant price trends.
	‚Ä¢	Fintech aggregators (like Plaid or Perfios) that show early signs of financial stress‚Äîmissed EMI payments, falling average balances, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Social listening tools that pick up on rising frustration or optimism before it reflects in numbers.

This real-time pulse check is turning into a secret weapon. If people start tightening spending this Friday, central banks might know by Monday.

And yes, privacy concerns are real‚Äîbut in a world where policy can make or break economies, data is power.



ü§ñ Will central banks rely more on AI-driven inflation modeling in 2025?

They already are. But they‚Äôre moving cautiously‚Äîbecause AI, while fast, can hallucinate. Sound familiar?

Here‚Äôs the tea:
	‚Ä¢	AI models are great for identifying anomalies, like when food prices spike due to a drought 3,000 miles away.
	‚Ä¢	But they‚Äôre bad at interpreting emotion‚Äîlike fear, hesitation, or public sentiment shifts that affect how people respond to inflation.

So central banks are using AI as an assistant, not a driver. It gives early warnings, flags risks, and suggests paths‚Äîbut humans still make the final call.

That‚Äôs a good thing. Because the last thing we need is a rate hike because an AI misread a meme trend.



üí° Insight Drop: ‚ÄúThinking, Fast and Slow‚Äù by Daniel Kahneman ‚Äì Chapter 20: The Illusion of Understanding

‚ÄúOur comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance.‚Äù

In 2025, central banks are finally admitting what most of us already knew: predicting inflation is messy. No single model holds all the truth. But the closer we get to seeing inflation as people live it, the better our odds of getting it right.



Interest Rate Strategies in a Slower Growth World

By now, most of us have accepted it: the turbo-charged, YOLO-growth economy of the 2010s isn‚Äôt coming back anytime soon. 2025 is a different beast. Productivity is plateauing, tech valuations are sobering up, and even emerging markets are feeling the drag of global slowdown vibes.

So how do central banks play this slower game? Interest rates used to be the emergency brake‚Äîbut now they‚Äôre being treated more like a thermostat: slow, intentional, and deeply sensitive to every economic shiver.

Let‚Äôs unpack the playbook.



üìâ Will central banks in developed economies maintain higher-for-longer interest rates?

Yep. And they‚Äôre not shy about it.

The phrase ‚Äúhigher for longer‚Äù has gone from economist jargon to financial reality in countries like the US, UK, Canada, and even parts of the Eurozone. It means central banks aren‚Äôt rushing to cut rates‚Äîeven if inflation cools‚Äîbecause they don‚Äôt want to accidentally wake the beast again.

Why the cautious stance?
	‚Ä¢	Sticky services inflation: Think haircuts, insurance, gym memberships. These prices don‚Äôt fall easily, and they make up a huge part of the inflation basket now.
	‚Ä¢	Asset bubble PTSD: Policymakers are haunted by how low rates in the 2010s inflated everything from real estate to NFTs.
	‚Ä¢	Demographic slowdowns: Aging populations = slower demand = less urgency to stimulate.

The result? Expect real interest rates (after inflation) to stay positive. That hasn‚Äôt been normal for a decade, and it‚Äôs already changing how people borrow, spend, and invest.

Personal note: I was banking on a mortgage rate cut to buy my first apartment in Pune. But when the RBI signaled no cuts till Q4, my broker literally laughed and said, ‚ÄúWait longer or settle smaller.‚Äù Yeah, felt that.



üåç How will emerging markets respond to diverging rate paths in the US and EU?

This one‚Äôs a tightrope walk. Emerging markets (EMs)‚Äîthink India, Brazil, Indonesia‚Äîcan‚Äôt just copy-paste what the US Fed or ECB is doing. Here‚Äôs why:
	‚Ä¢	Currency pressure: If US rates stay high while EMs cut, their currencies weaken. That fuels imported inflation‚Äîespecially in energy and tech.
	‚Ä¢	Capital flight risks: Global investors chase returns. Higher US yields can suck money out of EM debt markets in a snap.
	‚Ä¢	Domestic fragility: Most EMs are still healing from pandemic-era disruptions. Aggressive rate hikes hurt small businesses, informal workers, and rural credit.

So what‚Äôs the 2025 vibe? Asymmetric flexibility. EM central banks are:
	‚Ä¢	Holding rates steady longer than they‚Äôd like.
	‚Ä¢	Using macroprudential tools (like credit limits and capital controls) to buffer local economies.
	‚Ä¢	Tapping into FX reserves to keep currency volatility in check.

It‚Äôs a balancing act‚Äîeconomic chess at global scale.



‚öñÔ∏è What is the ‚Äúneutral rate‚Äù in 2025 and how are central banks defining it?

Let‚Äôs simplify. The neutral rate (r*) is the Goldilocks interest rate‚Äînot too hot, not too cold. It‚Äôs the rate where the economy isn‚Äôt speeding up or slowing down.

In 2025, figuring out this number is harder than guessing a friend‚Äôs ‚Äúreal‚Äù job from their LinkedIn profile. Why?
	‚Ä¢	Post-COVID shifts have scrambled labor force trends.
	‚Ä¢	Tech productivity is boosting some sectors, but not all.
	‚Ä¢	Geopolitical risks (like supply chain fragility and trade blocs) are distorting investment flows.

Still, most central banks now peg the neutral rate higher than before the pandemic‚Äîoften around 2.5%‚Äì3.5% real (adjusted for inflation). That‚Äôs a big shift.

Why it matters: If rates stay above neutral, they cool the economy. If they‚Äôre below, they stimulate. And in 2025, we‚Äôre hovering right at‚Äîor slightly above‚Äîthat line.



üå´Ô∏è How does persistent inflation uncertainty shape long-term rate planning?

Here‚Äôs the core dilemma: central banks are driving with foggy headlights. Inflation has proven stubborn, nonlinear, and driven by variables (like war, weather, and wages) that don‚Äôt obey traditional logic.

So, how do they plan rates 6‚Äì18 months out?
	‚Ä¢	Scenario modeling: Instead of one forecast, they run 50.
	‚Ä¢	Conditional forward guidance: Central banks now use phrases like ‚Äúdata-dependent‚Äù and ‚Äúuntil inflation expectations are anchored.‚Äù Translation: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll raise or cut when we feel like it, based on vibes and spreadsheets.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Yield curve management: Some are even experimenting with explicitly targeting long-term rates, not just short ones. Japan started it. Others are watching closely.

This strategy keeps their hands on the wheel‚Äîbut gives them wiggle room if the road turns.

A friend who trades bonds told me: ‚ÄúWe used to bet on rate moves quarterly. Now we watch central bankers like they‚Äôre TikTok creators‚Äîreading tone, expressions, even who they follow on social.‚Äù Wild, but real.



üí° Insight Drop: ‚ÄúThe Alchemy of Finance‚Äù by George Soros ‚Äì Chapter 2: Reflexivity in Financial Markets

‚ÄúMarkets are not merely passive reflectors of underlying realities; they can shape the reality they reflect.‚Äù

This insight is everything in 2025. Central banks know their rate decisions don‚Äôt just respond to inflation‚Äîthey also influence it by shaping how people think, react, and prepare. That reflexivity is the silent force behind every meeting, every speech, every basis point.

1la14cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthatbook/comments/1la14cp/short_story_collection_about_cats_from_early_90s/,Short story collection about cats from early 90's or before,"Ok, I tried last night about one of my two white whale books I can't find from my childhood and got the answer in literally less than 15 minutes. So, let's try the other. 

This was in the early 90's, had to be prior to 95' or 96' for sure. Same time frame as the other book which turned out to have come out in 93'. 

It was a collection of stories about cats. 

There was one story I remember fairly well. Though I may have details wrong bc I did on the other one. There is a girl at all girls school. She only has one friend. She hates the main teacher who runs the school. The girl has the really nice corner room. She feeds this stray cat outside her window. She loves him. She has a radio she likes as well. Over the course of the story things start going missing including the radio and the cat. She knows it is the headmistress. She knows she hurt the cat. She gets into a huge fight with her and the headmistress is playing coy like she knows nothing of what she is speaking about. 

The girl starts fully freaking out and she falls over the coffee table or something and skewers herself on a like spear or something. I don't know, she does accidentally. After her death we start to see the headmistress really did not have any idea about what she was upset about and is quite shaken up. The friend is also super upset. The headmistress wants to help her through this tough time and asks if there is anything she can do. The friend says she would like to move into the corner room in order to be closer to the memories of her friend. 

Headmistress agrees so friend goes and starts packing. She stops crying when she gets to her room opens the closet and pulls out a radio, several other objects that were the friends, and a black trash bag with a dead cat in it. She is going to dispose of them and then move into the room she wanted. 

It is the only story I remember at all. ",2,1749770664.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

My dad schedules his day around it (I wish I was joking). He‚Äôs retired but is responsible for the housework. We go to get coffee in the morning to get out and socialize but he doesn‚Äôt want to stay as long as normal because he wants to watch the trail. The second we get home he watches it. He sits in front of the TV and will only engage in conversations or other activities when they‚Äôre on a break or in a sidebar. If I try to talk during the trial, he ignores me, or he shushes me. I‚Äôm only home for the summer and it hurts.

I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôs becoming a problem because he is supposed to food shop on Fridays but he has decided to stay home to watch the trial. He‚Äôs neglecting his job.

As design professionals, I‚Äôd love your perspective:

* Do you think furniture that doubles as exercise equipment could be a desirable addition to modern interiors?
* What design elements or features would be important to ensure it blends seamlessly with a variety of styles?
* Are there challenges you foresee with usability or aesthetics that I should keep in mind?

Take first thing in the morning,  with or without food. 
I normally don't have breakfast,  but just coffee. So, today,  for the first time,  I took as instructed. Well  within first 30 mins, I had headaches, then followed with stomach intensity, wasn't pain or anything, just felt pressure.

I spent 5 hours in bed today, had some tingle limbs, headaches and tiredness. I was sitting through the whole side effects. 

I know for some people they had to switch medicine until they found the right one for them, but since my doctor didnt get back to me today, should I still take it as prescribed or wait for the doctor to get back to me? Im worried it might affect me for work again tomorrow.

That itch under your skin that whispers of cobblestone streets, ancient castles, and caf√©s where coffee is a ritual, not just a caffeine fix. And if you're starting from the concrete jungle, from the city that *literally* never sleeps, well, the leap across the pond feels particularly epic, doesn't it? We're talking about the ultimate adventure, the big one: getting from **nyc to europe**. It‚Äôs more than just booking a flight; it‚Äôs a state of mind, a logistical puzzle laced with excitement, and ultimately, an unforgettable journey. So, buckle up, buttercup, because we're about to dive headfirst into planning your European escapade from the Big Apple. This isn't your grandma's travel guide; we're going to get real, get granular, and get you across the Atlantic without feeling like you've been put through the wringer. Ready? Let's get started!

### The Genesis of a European Dream: Why Leave the Greatest City on Earth?

Seriously, why *would* you abandon the bright lights and siren song of New York City for a while? It‚Äôs a fair question, and one posed by perplexed friends and family alike. But for those of us bitten by the travel bug, the allure of Europe is undeniable. It's a continent steeped in history, bursting with diverse cultures, and offering a kaleidoscope of experiences. From the sun-drenched beaches of the Mediterranean to the snow-capped peaks of the Alps, there's something for everyone. Maybe you're craving a romantic getaway to Paris, a historical deep dive into Rome, an artistic pilgrimage to Florence, or perhaps you just want to wander aimlessly through the charming villages of the English countryside. Whatever your motivation, the call of Europe is a powerful one, a siren song that‚Äôs hard to resist, especially when you‚Äôre staring at the same skyscrapers day in and day out.

#### Unpacking the ""Why"": The Irresistible Pull Across the Pond

So, let‚Äôs get down to the nitty-gritty. Why the big jump from NYC? What's so darn appealing about Europe that it makes you want to brave jet lag and currency exchange rates? For starters, there's the history, palpable in every ancient ruin, every medieval castle, and every grand cathedral. You can literally walk in the footsteps of emperors, artists, and revolutionaries. It‚Äôs a living, breathing history lesson, far more engaging than any textbook. Then there's the culture ‚Äì the art, the music, the food! Oh, the food! From flaky croissants in Paris to authentic pasta in Italy and hearty stews in Germany, your taste buds are in for a wild ride. Beyond the famous sights, there's the chance to slow down, to savor life at a different pace. New York is all hustle and bustle, a relentless march forward. Europe, in many places, encourages you to linger, to people-watch at a cafe for hours, to get lost in winding streets. It's a reset button, a chance to breathe deeply and experience the world through a different lens. And let's be honest, bragging rights play a small part, don't they? ""Oh, I just got back from hiking in the Swiss Alps,"" sounds pretty darn impressive, even if you only made it halfway up.

### Navigating the Airways: Getting from nyc to europe

This is where the rubber meets the road, folks ‚Äì the actual act of getting over there. Flying from **nyc to europe** is undoubtedly the most common way to traverse the Atlantic. It's a long flight, no two ways about it. Think 7-8 hours minimum to Western Europe, and even longer to Eastern European destinations. But with advancements in aircraft technology and increasing competition among airlines, the journey has become more comfortable and, dare I say, even enjoyable (if you're lucky enough to score a seat with decent legroom!). There are direct flights galore from the major New York airports (JFK, LaGuardia - though less common for transatlantic, and Newark Liberty) to a plethora of European hubs like London, Paris, Rome, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and many more. Non-stop is always the dream, minimizing layovers and getting you to your destination faster. However, sometimes connecting flights can offer significant cost savings, forcing you to weigh convenience against budget. It‚Äôs a classic travel dilemma, like choosing between a great slice of pizza and a killer bagel ‚Äì both delicious, but different experiences!

#### The Nitty-Gritty of Booking Your Flight: A Tactical Approach

Booking your flight from NYC to Europe can feel overwhelming, a bit like trying to find a specific grain of sand on a beach. There are so many airlines, so many routes, and prices that seem to fluctuate with the wind. So, how do you tackle this beast?

- **Start Early:** Seriously, this is perhaps the most important piece of advice. Especially if you're planning to travel during peak season (summer, holidays), booking several months in advance can save you a bundle. Airlines release their tickets far in advance, and waiting until the last minute is a sure-fire way to pay top dollar.
- **Be Flexible with Your Dates:** If your travel dates are rigid, you're limiting your options. Even shifting your departure or return date by a day or two can dramatically impact the price. Tuesdays and Wednesdays often have the lowest fares, while weekends tend to be the most expensive. Think of it as playing the stock market of airfare ‚Äì timing is everything!
- **Consider Different Airports:** Don't just focus on the mega-airports. Sometimes flying into a smaller, secondary airport near your desired destination can be cheaper. For example, instead of flying directly into Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG), consider Orly (ORY). Research ground transportation options from these smaller airports; a little extra travel time on the ground might be worth the savings on your flight.
- **Utilize Flight Comparison Websites:** Google Flights, Skyscanner, Kayak, Momondo ‚Äì these are your best friends. They aggregate prices from various airlines and travel agencies, making it easy to compare options. Set price alerts so you're notified when fares drop.
- **Be Mindful of Hidden Fees:** Read the fine print! Baggage fees, seat selection fees, and even credit card processing fees can add up. Factor these into the total cost when comparing flights. Low-cost carriers (like Ryanair or EasyJet, which you might connect to for intra-European travel) are notorious for nickel-and-diming, so be prepared.
- **Think About Alliances:** If you're loyal to a particular airline or have frequent flyer miles, check if they're part of a global alliance (Star Alliance, SkyTeam, Oneworld). Flying within an alliance can help you earn and redeem miles and sometimes offer perks like lounge access.
- **Consider Budget Airlines (with caution):** For intra-European travel after you've crossed the Atlantic, budget airlines can be incredibly cheap. However, they often fly to secondary airports (requiring longer transfers) and have strict baggage restrictions. Don't expect a gourmet meal or lots of legroom! It's a no-frills experience, but it can save you a pretty penny.

### Beyond the Ticket: The Logistics of Your European Journey

Okay, you've booked your flight. High fives all around! But getting from NYC to Europe is more than just buying a ticket. There are myriad other things to consider to ensure a smooth and stress-free trip. Think of it like packing for a marathon ‚Äì the flight is just the start of the race; you need to be prepared for everything that comes after. From passports and visas to currency and connectivity, the devil is in the details, as they say. Getting these ducks in a row beforehand will save you a lot of headaches and allow you to fully immerse yourself in your European adventure.

#### The Pre-Departure Checklist: Ticking All the Boxes

Before you even think about packing that suitcase (more on that later!), you need to get organized. This is where being a planner pays off in spades.

- **Passport Power:** Is your passport valid? Does it have at least six months of validity beyond your planned departure date from Europe? This is crucial! Some countries are very strict about this. Does it have enough blank pages for stamps? If not, you'll need to renew it, and that can take time. Don't wait until the last minute!
- **Visa Verifications:** Are you an American citizen traveling to Europe? For stays up to 90 days within a 180-day period in the Schengen Area (most European countries), you typically don't need a visa for tourism or business. However, it's ALWAYS a good idea to check the specific entry requirements for *each* country you plan to visit. The rules can and do change. Better safe than sorry!
- **Travel Insurance: Your Safety Net:** Don't skip this! Travel insurance is like a superhero cape for your trip. It can cover unexpected medical expenses, trip cancellations or delays, lost luggage, and even emergency evacuations. The cost is usually a small percentage of your overall trip, but the peace of mind it provides is invaluable.
- **Money Matters: Euros and Beyond:** While the Euro is the common currency in many European countries, others use their own (British Pounds in the UK, Swiss Francs in Switzerland, etc.). Research the currency of each country you're visiting. Inform your bank and credit card companies of your travel plans to avoid having your cards blocked. Consider using a travel credit card with no foreign transaction fees. Having some local currency on hand for small purchases or tips is also a good idea.
- **Staying Connected: SIM Cards and Wi-Fi:** How will you stay in touch? Will you rely on free Wi-Fi (which can be spotty), purchase a local SIM card (usually a good value), or use an international roaming plan (can be expensive)? Decide on your strategy before you go. Having data is incredibly helpful for navigation and communication.
- **Getting Around Europe: Trains, Planes, and Automobiles:** Once you're on the continent, how will you travel between cities and countries? Europe has an excellent rail network, which is often a scenic and efficient way to travel. Budget airlines are also an option for longer distances. Renting a car can be great for exploring rural areas, but be prepared for narrow roads, different driving rules (driving on the left in the UK!), and potentially expensive parking.
- **Learning a Few Phrases:** While many Europeans speak English, especially in tourist areas, knowing a few basic phrases in the local language (hello, please, thank you, excuse me, do you speak English?) goes a long way and is always appreciated. It shows respect for the local culture.

### Packing for Your European Adventure: Less is More, Usually

Ah, packing. The bane of many a traveler's existence. Packing for a trip from NYC to Europe, especially if you're planning to visit multiple destinations with varying climates and activities, can feel like a complex Tetris game magnified by a thousand. The key, however, especially if you plan on moving around a lot, is to pack light. ""Less is more"" is the mantra here. Every extra ounce you pack is an ounce you'll have to lug onto trains, up stairs, and through cobblestone streets. Trust me, your back will thank you.

#### The Art of the Savvy European Suitcase: What to Bring and What to Leave Behind

Packing efficiently is a skill, my friends. And for a European trip, it‚Äôs a skill worth mastering. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of how to build your perfect European wardrobe and essentials:

1. **Layering is Your Friend:** European weather can be unpredictable, even in the same season. Pack layers that you can easily add or remove. Think t-shirts, long-sleeve shirts, sweaters, and a versatile jacket.
2. **Comfortable Footwear is Non-Negotiable:** You *will* be doing a lot of walking. Leave the stilettos (unless you're *strictly* going out for fancy dinners in taxis) and uncomfortable shoes at home. Prioritize comfy sneakers, walking shoes, or sturdy boots. Your feet will thank you after a day exploring ancient ruins or navigating busy city streets.
3. **Versatile Clothing:** Pack items that you can mix and match to create multiple outfits. Neutral colors work wonders. Scarves are great for adding a pop of color or covering your shoulders in churches.
4. **Travel Adapters and Converters:** European electrical outlets are different from those in the US. You'll need a travel adapter to plug in your devices. Check if your electronics are dual-voltage (most modern ones are); if not, you'll also need a converter.
5. **Medications and First-Aid:** Pack any prescription medications you need, along with a small first-aid kit containing essentials like pain relievers, band-aids, antiseptic wipes, and any over-the-counter medications you might need for common travel woes (like upset stomachs).
6. **Copies of Important Documents:** Make photocopies or take pictures of your passport, visa (if applicable), and travel insurance information. Store them separately from the originals in case of loss or theft.
7. **A Good Quality Travel Bag/Backpack:** Whether you prefer a suitcase or a backpack, choose one that is lightweight, durable, and easy to maneuver. If you plan on moving frequently, a backpack might be more practical.
8. **Reusable Water Bottle:** Stay hydrated and save money by refilling your water bottle. Many European cities have public fountains where you can fill up.
9. **An Open Mind and a Sense of Adventure:** This is arguably the most important thing to pack! Be open to new experiences, different cultures, and unexpected detours. Embrace the serendipity of travel.

### Arriving in Europe: Stepping Onto a New Continent

The long flight is over. You've navigated customs and immigration. You've officially made it from NYC to Europe! Now what? Stepping off that plane and onto European soil is an exhilarating feeling, a mixture of exhaustion and pure excitement. The air might smell different, the language around you might be unfamiliar, and suddenly, you're truly *there*. But before you rush off to find the nearest gelato stand or pub, there are a few practicalities to consider upon arrival.

#### Your First Steps on European Ground: From Airport to Accommodation

The first few hours in a new country can be a little disorienting, even for seasoned travelers. Having a plan for getting from the airport to your accommodation will make a world of difference.

- **Public Transportation: Your Best Bet:** European cities generally have excellent public transportation systems. Trains, buses, and metro lines are often the most affordable and efficient way to get from the airport to the city center. Do a little research beforehand on the best route to your accommodation.
- **Taxis: Convenient, but Pricier:** Taxis are readily available but will be significantly more expensive than public transport. Make sure you use official taxis and agree on a fare or ensure the meter is running.
- **Ride-Sharing Apps:** Uber and similar ride-sharing services are available in many European cities, offering a convenient alternative to traditional taxis.
- **Airport Transfers:** Some hotels offer airport transfer services, which can be convenient but are usually more expensive than public transport.
- **Validate Your Tickets:** If you use public transportation, make sure you validate your ticket! There are often machines for this, and ticket inspectors can be strict, issuing hefty fines if you don't.
- **Orientation and Getting Your Bearings:** Once you‚Äôve reached your accommodation, take a moment to get your bearings. Locate nearby landmarks, familiarize yourself with the local area, and figure out the nearest public transit stops. A quick walk around the block can help you feel more settled.

### Embracing the European Experience: More Than Just Sightseeing

You didn't come all the way from NYC to Europe just to snap photos of famous landmarks, did you? (Okay, maybe a little bit!). But the true magic of Europe lies in immersing yourself in the local culture, in savoring the little moments, and in allowing yourself to slow down and simply *be*. It's about sitting in a piazza and watching the world go by, getting lost in a charming neighborhood, and striking up conversations with locals (even if it‚Äôs just with smiles and gestures).

#### Savoring the Journey: How to Truly Experience Europe

This is where the rich tapestry of Europe unfolds. It‚Äôs about more than just ticking items off a list; it's about building memories.

- **Wander Aimlessly:** Don't overschedule yourself. Leave room for spontaneity and just wandering around. Some of the best discoveries are made when you get a little bit lost (in a safe way, of course!).
- **Eat Like a Local:** Venture beyond the tourist traps and seek out local restaurants and cafes. Ask for recommendations from locals. Try the regional specialties. Food is such an integral part of European culture.
- **Embrace the Cafe Culture:** Find a cozy cafe, order a coffee or a glass of wine, and simply people-watch. It's a quintessential European experience and a great way to soak in the atmosphere.
- **Visit Local Markets:** Markets are fantastic places to experience the sights, sounds, and smells of a city. You can find local produce, cheeses, baked goods, crafts, and often delicious street food.
- **Attend Local Events:** Check for local festivals, concerts, or sporting events happening during your visit. Participating in these can offer a unique glimpse into the local culture.
- **Learn a Few Words of the Local Language:** We mentioned this before, but it bears repeating. Even a few words show respect and can open doors to more meaningful interactions.
- **Strike Up Conversations:** Don't be afraid to talk to locals. They can offer invaluable insights and recommendations that you won't find in guidebooks.
- **Slow Down and Observe:** New York is fast-paced; Europe often encourages a slower rhythm. Allow yourself to adjust to that pace. Sit on a park bench, watch the world go by, and simply observe.

### Common Potholes and How to Avoid Them: A Heads-Up for the NYC Traveler

Alright, let's be real for a second. Even the most perfectly planned trip can hit a snag. Travel isn't always seamless, and knowing some of the potential pitfalls beforehand can help you navigate them with grace (or at least minimize the stress). Coming from NYC, you're probably pretty street-smart, but Europe has its own unique quirks and challenges. A little foresight goes a long way in preventing those frustrating moments that can sometimes put a damper on your adventure.

#### Anticipating Obstacles: Preparing for the Unexpected

Being forewarned is being forearmed, as the saying goes. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you explore Europe:

- **Pickpocketing and Petty Theft:** Unfortunately, pickpocketing can be an issue in crowded tourist areas in some European cities. Be aware of your surroundings, keep your valuables secure, and consider wearing a money belt or a cross-body bag that's difficult to access.
- **Scams:** Be wary of overly friendly strangers offering unsolicited help or trying to involve you in street games. These can often be scams. Trust your gut instinct.
- **Language Barriers:** While English is widely spoken, especially in tourist areas, don't assume everyone will understand you. Have a translation app handy or a small phrasebook. Patience and clear communication are key.
- **Different Customs and Etiquette:** Research the local customs and etiquette of the countries you're visiting. Simple things like tipping practices or mealtime customs can vary greatly. Being respectful of local traditions is important.
- **Navigating Public Transport:** While generally excellent, public transport systems can be confusing at first, especially in large cities. Plan your routes in advance, understand how to buy and validate tickets, and factor in potential delays.
- **Strikes:** Strikes, particularly involving transportation, can be a reality in some European countries. Keep an eye on local news for any potential disruptions.
- **Jet Lag:** It's a beast, especially coming from NYC to Europe. Try to adjust to the local time as quickly as possible. Get some sunlight upon arrival and try to stay awake until a reasonable bedtime.
- **Over-Tourism:** In popular destinations during peak season, expect crowds. Be patient, try to visit popular sights early in the morning or late in the day, and explore lesser-known neighborhoods.
