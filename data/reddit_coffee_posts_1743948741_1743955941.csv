I‚Äôm up with a good book. Let‚Äôs chat!

A bit about me‚Ä¶. I enjoy the great outdoors, reading books, and relaxing in the evening with a puff of weed. My favorite food is pizza. The best part of the day is that first sip of coffee. Zoom meetings are the worst thing ever. And if I could go anywhere in the world it would be Japan (though Italy is a close second). 

Care to chat? How‚Äôs this for an icebreaker: what‚Äôs your favorite book? 

Can‚Äôt pick one? Send a couple!

My favorite is‚Ä¶. I‚Äôll go with Pachinko. But it‚Äôs tough to pick just one.

1jsxh0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1jsxh0t/update_6_years_post_affairdivorce/,UPDATE: 6 years post affair/divorce,"What a crazy last few years it has been.  Things are finally calmed down between me and my Narc ex wife.  This is a long recap and update, but hopefully it gives someone hope ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Recap:  After 21 years and 2 kids she decided to have an affair with my (now former) best friend.  He and I served together in Afghanistan and he started grooming me over the year we were deployed there together.  He was going through a divorce and blamed his wife for cheating on him.  Turned out he was caught sleeping with 2 other friend‚Äôs wives and was sent to Afghanistan to get him away from them so those families could heal and work on their relationships.  After we came home from Afghanistan I left the military and started working for an airline.  When my former best friend retired I helped him get an airline job too (not the same company as he failed the interview at mine!  The interviewers said he had psychopathic traits and turned the interview around on the interviewers).  He came to visit for work and it was just me going to take him out to dinner when he was in my city.  Eventually my now ex wife said her and the kids would like to meet him since he was my best friend and we talked all the time.  So I brought them out to meet him on his next trip and he charmed her and the kids like he does everyone‚Ä¶super manipulative and deceptive.  He then asked if he could come visit ( not just for work) and I invited him to stay with us in our home.  That turned into a monthly thing.  I thought it was great to get to spend so much time with my best war buddy, he had alternate reasons‚Ä¶

After a few trips to visit us he shared that he wanted to move to our city and asked if he could rent my guest suite from me until he found a place of his own.  I welcomed him in and didn‚Äôt think twice about helping my buddy out.  As soon as he moved in I barely saw him anymore‚Ä¶

I would get my airline schedule and give it to my wife, and she would send it to him.  Then his airline would bid for schedules AFTER mine was released and he made sure he was in my house when I was working and he was working when I was home.  This went on for 6 months!  Not only did I not see him but he never paid me a dime and used those six months to have complete access to my family and home.  Looking back I see how utterly dumb this was to allow a divorced man to be in my house around my family when I wasn‚Äôt there.  My empath nature burned me.  He is a Psychopath, he groomed me for years to get me comfortable and be able to manipulate me like this.  I was weak and didn‚Äôt have any boundaries against him (or my wife).

I started getting the oompa-lompa vibes around my birthday when she started dressing nicer, doing her hair and nails, and I would see them drinking coffee together in the morning (she never drank a drop of coffee before him living with us).  My 40th birthday came up and she didn‚Äôt even say HBD to me that morning!  Something was off, way off.  We were still having sex, in fact it was more frequent than ever.  But not even a Happy Birthday on my 40th???  Something was up.  We had a Ring camera in the living room to watch the dog when we would travel.  I hadn‚Äôt been snooping on my family while on the road, but should have been.  They both knew the camera was there too‚Ä¶

2 days after my bday I was on a trip and the camera goes off in the middle of the night, she‚Äôs running downstairs from the guest suite in nothing but her birthday suit ü§¨.  I rewound the video and watched the previous few weeks and saw it all.  They had sex in my living room.  Groped each other and made out in front of my kids while I was at work.  It was BRUTAL.  I kicked him out and took my wife to intensive marriage counseling.  She lied through her teeth to the therapist and made me feel bad about her cheating.

I wasn‚Äôt attentive enough, I was a bad dad, I never let her do what she wanted, I didn‚Äôt speak her love language, etc etc etc.  All blame shifting to me.  I was gaslit so hard my head was spinning.  I lost 40 pounds in 2 months and was a wreck.  3 therapy sessions a week weren‚Äôt helping and she was caught sneaking out to see him over and over.  When I would present her with the proof on the continued affair she would deny non stop.  She lied to the therapist constantly until the last session where I showed proof of a recent sexual encounter with him 2 days earlier (she swore she had been NC for over a month).  The therapist‚Äôs jaw was on the floor.  After that session I finally decided this wasn‚Äôt the life I wanted and initiated the divorce.



So nearly 6 years later here we are.  She got a job teaching at my kids High School and manipulates the kids daily.  They know what she‚Äôs doing but they still want ‚Äúa mom.‚Äù  My kids hate her for what she did to me and all the lies she told them about me.  They are 15 and 17, they know the truth about what happened and my ex is STILL with the guy!  She told them 5 different stories about how they started dating AFTER the divorce, I set the kids straight and then the kids find her hand written cheating love letters IN HER HOME, that detailed their affair while we were married.  I can‚Äôt make this up ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

She has lost all of her friends.  She has made some new acquaintances at work but they don‚Äôt know her.  All of her old friends have seen the videos/emails/texts and wrote her off like a bad case of herpes.  She spends every free minute with him and he‚Äôs still sleeping around on her according to mutual friends who have kept tabs on him.  My ex wife is just one of many for this Psycho.  

As part of the divorce I agreed to a $1 Million settlement over 11 years, nearly all of it in cash minus $125k in an IRA for her.  We had a lot of retirement accounts, military retirement, home, brokerage, etc to divide. I kept everything and agreed to pay 1/2 up front in cash (and IRA) and the rest over 11 years‚Ä¶with restrictions.  The alimony has the standard clause that it will end if she gets married, but I also added in that it ends if she co-habitates!  That is NOT part of state law at all, but I got it added in mediation.  So 6 years in they STILL aren‚Äôt engaged or living together!  He has the perfect setup, he can tell her she has to keep her house and can‚Äôt live with him.  Since my kids LOATHE him she can‚Äôt bring him around the kids so he is free to play with other women while she has the kids 1/2 the month!  In 5 years when the alimony ends, do you think he will finally moved her in (11 years in?!?!)?  I‚Äôm almost enjoying watching this!

She has burned through every penny I gave her up front.  $480,000, It‚Äôs all gone.  I double her paycheck with my alimony/child support each month but she has expensive tastes for a school teacher.  Our last year of marriage she averaged $11,000/month on her credit card.  I now give her just $3,000/month!  I‚Äôm saving a fortune by not having to support her reckless spending.  If you subtract out the money she was bringing into the marriage from her avg monthly bill that left me with $8,000 in credit card debt to pay off each month.  Now just giving her $3k means I save $5k/month!  That‚Äôs a $60,000/year savings just on her credit card alone.  Divorce has been an amazing financial boost!

My income has increased 4 fold since the divorce!  And she gets NONE of the extra (I also wrote that in tot he divorce!).  My net worth has also quadrupled and I‚Äôm well on my way to an early retirement if I so choose.  She on the other hand JUST started working for a city school at age 43 and has no retirement savings other than the IRA I gave her.  She will be working for a longgggg time unless she finds someone to marry her and pay for her.

I took the divorce hard and my weight went up and down in unhealthy ways.  I lost 40 pounds this past year and have finally prioritized my health over taking care of everyone else.  It has been amazing!

But the best part, and why I needed to share the other crap before this‚Ä¶I have had the most amazing partner for the last 2.5 years.  She was also married to a physically/sexually/emotionally abusive Narc.  And we have helped each other heal and grow.  We ‚Äúget‚Äù each other and our relationship is so loving and amazing!  It made being abused for 21 years worth it to teach me what I wanted (and would never tolerate again), and my kids see it too!  We share 2 dogs together and everyone in our world is happy.  There is an abundance of love, smiles, hugs, money, time, empathy in my home now and everyone is thriving.  I never thought it would happen‚Ä¶

My ex has gained a ton of weight and is almost unrecognizable to me.  I‚Äôm guessing at some point her AP will finally write her off for good and she will be left with a big nothing-sandwich to chew on.  She‚Äôs living paycheck to paycheck (on $6k/mo), and has had to curb all of her expensive tastes.  Meanwhile my kids and GF travel abroad and are living an amazing life together free of her drama and manipulation.  

I was the one who fought to keep our family/marriage together while she disrespected me and our marriage over and over.  If this sounds like you, leave that person.  You should never be a ‚Äúchoice‚Äù to your person.  If they don‚Äôt prioritize you over EVERYONE else, then they are not your person and it‚Äôs time to move on.  Love, healing and empathy do exist for us all out there.  You just have to walk away from your Narc cheater to heal. When you are ready, the right person will show up in your life!  

My friend group has grown a ton with friends who have been cheated on as well, we all help each other with the cheating recovery as well as the Narc co-parenting struggles.  There is strength in numbers and love and healing do happen, in time.

I have been in therapy for the last 6 years and have learned so much.  If you are struggling, pay the money, find a good therapist or support group, and do the work on yourself.  It takes an average of 1/2 the time you were in a relationship to get over it when it ends traumatically.  I‚Äôm a little over 1/2 way on my ‚Äúhealed‚Äù timeline.  Everyday it gets a little better!

As for our cheating exes, let them go!  No longer your circus or your monkey!  They were never worthy of our time, energy, and love.  Someone else out there is waiting for you to heal and be ready for them, and they will treat you like GOLD!  You deserve to be happy and your kids want to see you happy too!  Get away from your cheater and never look back.  They aren‚Äôt worth the mental real-estate in your brain that you‚Äôve been allowing them to occupy rent free!

Personal info: I am f27 and he is m36.

About a month ago I wrote about work colleague I went out few times and talked a lot, but he never even tried to go for any intimacy. Then, two weeks ago I told him I like him and need some clarity on whether we are friends or is there potential for anything more. He talked about how screwed up he is currently, how much negative consequences there might be (more-less all imagined, worst thing at work that can happen is that people gossip about us - they already gossip about everyone), how I might not understand his friends and family because they are ‚Äúweird‚Äù but after three hours of talking we ended up kissing and cuddling and, his words, ‚Äúhe is definitely ready to risk it‚Äù. It was very obvious that he was aroused. We were together 2 weeks, laughed, had some short dates, texted and joked basically everyday and then he invited me on another date and left me.

He spent an hour talking about how he is not sure what he feels, whether he is in love and doesn‚Äôt wanna hurt me. How he has hard time falling in love and fears lying both to me and to himself he is in love and that he horribly fears he will take my virginity (this is not a big deal for me but obviously is to him) and then later realise its not it and will hurt me. That apparently broke some of his ex-relationships. I was to shocked to really say anything, I just said emotions cannot be forced and that I understand him and do not want to push him. However, when I wanted to go home, he practically pleaded me to stay and we talked for 3 more hours. He talked about wanting to remain friends, that he doesn‚Äôt have anyone who he is able to talk so freely about some subjects, about how fun I am and that he doesn‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with him not to fall in love with such ‚Äúcool girl‚Äù. He talked about how we are too different and literally said so much stupid stuff I cannot even comprehend it - I would think his family is crazy (I told him no family is perfect), how I am wild and he is boring, how he is not as innocent as I am (?!)‚Ä¶ It basically turned into break up where I was comforting him that he is not a bad person more than I was comforting myself. We also laughed, joked, he looked me deeply in my eyes several times and he had to adjust himself a lot (so physical attraction is obviously not lacking). He basically begged for our friendship to continue and I told him ok, I just need some short time to figure things out. We remained friends on social networks, I watched his stories and he watched mine but we didn‚Äôt react‚Ä¶

Anyway, I keep thinking about that breakup and in that shock I didn‚Äôt say all what I wanted. What I get from that, looking at this today, is that he expects love to strike him like a lighting bolt while I think it is something that grows with time. And that he expects to be able to promise me forever while truth is we never know what life brings. He doesn‚Äôt wanna hurt me, but I‚Äôd rather be hurt in future if things don‚Äôt work out, than now when I feel he stopped us even before we had a chance to develop some deeper connection. And reason why I never was with a guy before is not because I am prude or afraid to get hurt but because I just wanted someone that I like. It really doesn‚Äôt need to mean forever - I mean, we could die in car crash tomorrow. And I really really want to tell him all that because I want at least to try with him.

So basically, should I reach out and say what I wrote? Invite him for a short coffee and tell him? And if yes, should I do it this week, or rather give him a week of pause and then reach out next week? My friends tell me he is toxic and to move on, that life is not romcom (which I know), but I was always very direct in life and deeply believe that open communication is key to success of relationships.

1jsxbdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/afterlife/comments/1jsxbdo/how_knowledge_of_the_afterlife_changed_my_life/,How Knowledge of the Afterlife Changed My Life,"For my entire life (I'm currently in my mid-60's,) even since I was a young child, I believed in an afterlife of some sort, but I did not **know** there was actually an afterlife until early 2018, about a year after my wife died.

Even though I had consumed some various media and information concerning the afterlife for decades before her death, the despairing, devastating grief I experienced after her death clearly defined the gaping chasm between *believing* and *knowing*. Even though I consciously, intellectually believed in the afterlife, my body, emotions and psychology were reacting as if she was gone forever and I'd never see her, talk to her, or hold her again.

After about a year of intense, virtually 24/7 research into afterlife evidence and information, and using various methods of communicating with here, recognizing communication from her, interacting with her through various methods and experiences, and using various self-programming techniques to counteract the constant *social reinforcement* that ""dead = gone forever,"" I reached the point where I **knew** there was an afterlife, with zero doubt whatsoever.

Knowing something is vastly different from simply believing. It changes you at a fundamental level, deep in your psyche and subconscious. This is evident in how so many NDErs live's are completely changed by their experience, and the same is true for people that have similar experiences. All it usually takes for even the most hardcore materialist skeptic is one experience, *just one,* to completely change their minds. NDE and other experiential reports from former, hardcore materialist skeptics attest to this. For others, exposure to the wealth of evidence can do the trick; many scientists involved in afterlife research began as hardcore, materialist skeptics, but their own research changed their minds.

For me, that knowledge entirely ended my grief and sadness, and I was happy again. WRT my wife, we still love each other and greatly enjoy our ""transdimensional"" relationship. It's fun and exciting. Nothing in this world worries or concerns me, and believe me, that has been very seriously put to the test. I have zero existential angst. I am at peace, feel completely fulfilled and whole. I know what's coming. I am ready to either continue living or die today - it's all good with me. While I eagerly anticipate what is to come, right here and right now is very, very enjoyable - and that's coming from a legally blind disabled guy who is living near the poverty line in terms of income.

With all integrity and honesty, for what it is worth, I can tell you that there is, in fact, an afterlife, and as long as you are not a corrupt, evil, cruel, malicious bastard, you're going to love it. And even **those** other people will probably love where they find themselves after they die, because it reflects their nature and is the home world of cruel, corrupt evil bastards. Let them do their evil deeds on each other in their world as long as they like; my wife and I will be in our beach house making love like Edward and Bella, enjoying some coffee and a smoke on the deck afterwards, gazing out at the wondrous astral ocean and sunset, baby.",2,1743954933.0,afterlife,0,1.0,False

**Government-Supported Community Spaces: Revitalizing Public Life & Reducing Digital Dependency**  
*A Practical Framework for Social Reconnection*

# The Challenge: Isolation in a Digitally Dominated World

While social media platforms offer a veneer of connectivity, they often prioritize engagement metrics over genuine human interaction. This results in digital spaces cluttered with algorithm-driven content, bots, and commercial agendas. Meanwhile, public spaces‚Äîparks and recreation centers supported by taxpayer dollars‚Äîare underused. This initiative proposes a government-coordinated, weekly gathering that transforms these spaces into warm, unbranded hubs for organic, low-pressure connection. The goal is to reintroduce the simple pleasure of face-to-face interaction in a setting that feels safe, human, and free of overt market influences.

# Core Proposal

**1. Weekly Community Hours in Public Spaces**

* **Structure**:
   * **Fixed Time/Location**: Every Saturday from 10 AM‚Äì2 PM at centrally located parks or recreation centers, with indoor backup plans for inclement weather.
   * **No-Cost Amenities & Food**:
      * Complimentary light refreshments such as coffee, sandwiches, and community potluck-style offerings.
      * Food is provided in a way that emphasizes community sharing rather than commercial branding, creating a space that feels removed from market pressures.
   * **Activity Zones & Games**:
      * **Interactive Games**: Gentle physical activities like tug-of-war, board games, or other simple challenges that are fun yet not overly competitive.
      * **Small Prizes & Rewards**: Winners of these games or challenges receive modest, community-sourced prizes (e.g., tokens, handmade items, or local crafts) to incentivize participation without creating a commercial atmosphere.
   * **Subtle Support**:
      * Social workers or community volunteers are available at an informal ‚ÄúHelp & Conversation‚Äù booth, offering guidance only upon request.
* **Activities**:
   * Optional, themed sessions such as ‚ÄúSkill Swap Hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúLocal History Talks‚Äù encourage dialogue and skill sharing without making participation feel obligatory.

**2. Funding & Partnerships**

* **Taxpayer Efficiency**:
   * Redirect 3‚Äì5% of existing budgets from mental health and park maintenance to fund these events, ensuring a responsible use of public funds.
   * For example, a city with a $2M parks budget could allocate between $60,000 and $100,000 annually to support staffing, supplies, games, and modest prizes.
* **Community & Nonprofit Collaborations**:
   * Engage local nonprofits, community groups, and volunteers to contribute supplies and coordinate activities‚Äîkeeping the initiative grassroots and free from overt corporate influence.
   * Partnerships with local artisans or community kitchens can supply food or prizes in a way that underscores communal support rather than market branding.

**3. Safety & Accessibility**

* **Discreet, Friendly Security**:
   * Off-duty police or trained community staff will be present in a non-intrusive manner to ensure everyone‚Äôs safety while preserving a welcoming atmosphere.
* **Universal Access**:
   * Venues will be fully ADA-compliant, with clear multilingual signage and dedicated quiet or sensory-friendly zones to cater to all community members.
   * No registration or ID checks are required, ensuring an open, unguarded environment where everyone feels welcome.

# Addressing Key Concerns

# 1. Avoiding Stigma: ‚ÄúFor Everyone, By Everyone‚Äù

* **Neutral Framing**:
   * Events are marketed simply as ‚ÄúCommunity Hours‚Äù or ‚ÄúNeighbor Days,‚Äù emphasizing collective belonging without labels or therapeutic implications.
   * Example tagline: *‚ÄúYour park. Your people. Every Saturday.‚Äù*
* **Voluntary, Enjoyable Participation**:
   * Attendees are free to join group activities, engage in a friendly game of tug-of-war, or simply enjoy a quiet moment‚Äîensuring that no one feels pressured into interaction.

# 2. Practical Benefits for Taxpayers

* **Preventive Value**:
   * Utilizing existing public spaces and resources helps prevent more costly social and health issues by fostering community support networks.
* **Community ROI**:
   * Enhanced face-to-face interactions can lead to new job leads, shared skills, and local volunteer initiatives, ultimately boosting overall community productivity.

# 3. Realistic Social Dynamics

* **Organic Interaction**:
   * Whether through casual games, shared meals, or unstructured time in communal seating areas, the design encourages natural, spontaneous connections.
* **Overcoming the ‚ÄúStranger Barrier‚Äù**:
   * The visible presence of others who are seeking similar experiences removes the hesitation often experienced during isolated park visits, building a shared sense of purpose.

# 4. Digital Detox Incentive

* **A Human-Centric Alternative**:
   * These Community Hours provide a safe space where real identities, local shared experiences, and tangible interactions replace the superficiality of digital platforms‚Äîhelping reduce overall screen time.

# Expected Outcomes

# Short-Term (6‚Äì12 Months)

* **Enhanced Park Utilization**: A projected 30‚Äì40% increase in weekend foot traffic at pilot locations.
* **Stronger Local Networks**: Surveys may show around 25% of participants exchanging contact information for future meetups or casual play dates.
* **Reduced Digital Reliance**: Participants might report reducing their daily social media use by 1‚Äì2 hours on average.

# Long-Term (3‚Äì5 Years)

* **Economic Efficiency**: For every $1 invested, the program is expected to save $3‚Äì4 in reduced healthcare, policing, and social service costs.
* **Cultural Transformation**: Parks and public spaces evolve into symbols of community vitality and genuine connection rather than areas associated with isolation.
* **Scalability**: The adaptable model can be tailored‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúFriday Night BBQs‚Äù in rural areas or ‚ÄúUrban Lounge Hours‚Äù in cities‚Äîand replicated across communities nationwide.

# Conclusion: Reclaiming Public Life

This initiative is a grounded, realistic response to the challenges of digital isolation and underused public spaces. By leveraging existing community assets and emphasizing organic interaction, Community Hours offer a safe, unbranded environment where genuine human connections can flourish. It‚Äôs not a grand experiment but a return to the fundamentals of social life‚Äîwhere fun games, shared meals, and small rewards create a welcoming space for all.

**Why This Works**:

* **Low-Cost, High-Impact**: Makes optimal use of existing resources with only modest budgetary adjustments.
* **Apolitical and Inclusive**: Focuses on universal human needs‚Äîbelonging, safety, and the joy of connection‚Äîwithout commercial influence.
* **Human-Centric and Realistic**: Emphasizes dignity, choice, and natural social interactions over forced or overly marketed approaches.

*Proposed by the Office of Civic Engagement & Community Vitality*  
*Public feedback is welcome through town halls and online portals.*

**Tagline**: *‚ÄúCome as you are. Leave a little more connected.‚Äù*",2,1743954688.0,SeriousConversation,2,1.0,False

He had a troubled upbringing, which culminated in him ultimately passing away from sui***e. He was young, having not even graduated from high school yet.

The Year 1 Recap,"HegeCoin ($HEGE) launched one year ago. One full trip around the sun for the hedgehog that refused to fade Hegena. From humble beginnings to multiple CEX listings, global street art campaigns, NFT collections, DRiP adoption, community fundraising and viral TikToks, the Hege journey has been anything but boring.

Along the way, it‚Äôs built a vibrant, creative, and fiercely loyal community that punches way above its market cap. If you missed the 6-month recap, check it out here for the early days:

With a revamped merch store on the way, more exchange listings in the pipeline, and a community that's shown it can punch way above its market cap, $HEGE is gearing up to lead the memecoin recovery rally and evolves into a fully-fledged brandcoin.

For a project with this amount global reach, universal appeal and grassroots strength, $HEGE remains massively undervalued. The upside potential is huge. $HEGE your bets.

The Year 1 Recap,"HegeCoin ($HEGE) launched one year ago. One full trip around the sun for the hedgehog that refused to fade Hegena. From humble beginnings to multiple CEX listings, global street art campaigns, NFT collections, DRiP adoption, community fundraising and viral TikToks, the Hege journey has been anything but boring.

Along the way, it‚Äôs built a vibrant, creative, and fiercely loyal community that punches way above its market cap. If you missed the 6-month recap, check it out here for the early days:

1jswury,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jswury,"Starlux A350 Business Class for only 75,000 points ‚Äì San Francisco to Taipei","Starlux has been making waves as Asia‚Äôs newest full-service premium airline ‚Äî and as Taiwan‚Äôs third carrier, it‚Äôs already carving out a niche with its luxury-first approach. Its flagship A350-900 is outfitted with just 306 seats, offering an experience that feels more boutique than big-box.

**How I booked Starlux A350 Business Class**

I scored a seat in Business Class from San Francisco (SFO) to Taipei (TPE) for only 75,000 points‚Äî all thanks to an award alert from [Roame.Travel](https://roame.travel/).

I used Roame‚Äôs powerful flight alert tool to track premium cabin award space, and as soon as Starlux released availability, I jumped on it.

Starlux is a partner of Alaska Airlines Mileage Plan, which is currently the best (and only) way to book its long-haul flights with points. One-way business class from the U.S. to Taipei prices at a flat 75,000 miles, and award availability has been surprisingly decent ‚Äî especially from San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Considering this flight often retails for over $4,000 one-way, redeeming Alaska miles here yields \~5.2 cents per mile, which is excellent value.

For comparison, ANA business class on similar routes costs 52,500 points through Virgin Atlantic, but the experience onboard Starlux arguably beats ANA in design and even hard product.

**Alaska Lounge San Francisco (SFO) Review ‚Äì Lounge Access for Starlux Business Class Passengers**

Starlux Airlines operates from Terminal 1 at San Francisco International Airport (SFO), granting its business class passengers access to the NEW Alaska Lounge located near Gate B6.

This 11,000-square-foot lounge, which opened in June 2024, offers a comfortable environment with various seating options, including caf√©-style tables, high-top workspaces, and lounge chairs with tarmac views. Nearly all of the seats are equipped with power outlets.

The lounge provides a selection of complimentary snacks and beverages. In the morning, guests can enjoy fresh fruit, oatmeal, and the signature made-to-order pancakes. Throughout the day, options include deli meats, cheeses, and a variety of soups and salads. There‚Äôs also a cute self-serve candy station, featuring local treats like Ghirardelli chocolates and jelly beans.¬†

When I went, it was already late and there was a wonderful dinner spread of pasta, salads, sauteed green beans, a dessert station, and a pancake ‚Äúprinter‚Äù

For beverages, there are 2 high-end Eversys coffee machines with coffee from San Francisco-based Ritual Coffee Roasters, a Coca-Cola soda machine, and teas. There‚Äôs also a full-service bar offering local craft brews, West Coast wines, and spirits.

All the staff members were super friendly! I would say the new Alaska Airlines lounge at SFO is one of the best domestic lounges I have experienced.

**Inside the Starlux A350 Business Class Cabin**

Walking onboard the A350-900, the mood lighting and warm ambient tones immediately impress. I would say it‚Äôs futuristic meets classy.

The Business Class cabin is laid out in a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone configuration, with a total of 26 seats. Each seat offers direct aisle access though not all the windows match up with the seats, so you‚Äôll have to look them up on Aerlopa beforehand to confirm.

Each seat was styled with copper and dark wood texture. Each seat had a metal privacy door as well.

The overall design is space-themed, but done in a classy, understated way.

‚ÄãUpon boarding, passengers receive a THREE-branded amenity kit, featuring popular skincare essentials: a lip balm, overnight oil serum, and moisturizer.

Additionally, passengers are provided with slippers and high-quality, camel-colored pajamas that tastefully have the Starlux logo on the back collar area. (I kept mine!)

The in-flight entertainment system features a 24-inch 4K high-definition touchscreen offering an extensive selection of over 145 movies, including recent Hollywood releases and classics.

The system supports Bluetooth connectivity, allowing passengers to use their personal headphones, though Starlux-branded noise-canceling headphones are also provided.

Each seat is equipped with multiple charging options, including USB-A, USB-C ports, a wireless charging pad, and a standard international outlet, ensuring devices remain powered throughout the journey.

I personally consider Starlux‚Äôs hard product one of the best business class seats out there and even better than Qatar Airways‚Äô Qsuites.

**Dining**

Meal service kicked off about 45 minutes after takeoff and was quite tasty.

The dinner menu included:

\- Appetizer: Chicken liver terrine with rhubarb compote, salad, pistachio

\- Main course: Braised beef cheek with truffle mashed potatoes

\- Dessert: Assorted ice cream and fruit

You can also pre-order your meal online before departure, which I did ‚Äî opting for the braised beef cheek (absolutely worth it).

Mid-flight snacks included japanese chashu ramen and braised beef burger.

I‚Äôve flown Starlux quite a few times now and it seems that they keep on experimenting with their menu.

**Sleeping Experience**

After the meal service, the attentive cabin crew transformed my seat into a fully flat bed, measuring 6 feet 7 inches (200 cm) in length and 23.6 inches (60 cm) in width at its widest point. The bed was outfitted with a plush mattress pad, a soft duvet, and a comfortable pillow, creating an inviting sleep environment.

Even though there were no individual air nozzles, the cabin maintained a pleasantly cool temperature throughout the flight. The footwell was a little awkward on one of the sides because of a slight kink so it was more comfortable to sleep on my side.

**Final Verdict**

From the design-forward cabin and gourmet dining to the high-level of service, Starlux was a true flagship business class experience.

For just 75,000 Alaska miles, it‚Äôs also one of the best redemptions across the Pacific right now and much easier to book than ANA or JAL business class.

* In the summer 2022 a working group was formed to ""bring to **RESOLUTION** Credit Suisse""
* This group consisted of the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the FDIC and the SEC. (What is the SEC doing at THIS table of all senior level banking institutions?)
* In March of 2023 the weekend before puts that were briefly viewable on Bloomberg expired, the Swiss government forced UBS to take over Credit Suisse and sealed the records for 50+ years! ... **NOTHING TO SEE HERE**
* In August of 2023 the working group published a paper saying the were big sad that the Swiss government chose this route instead of bringing the situation to **RESOLUTION** and explicitly stated they felt they had ***$$$$*** ready for this operation! (side note it has been mentioned that their are 2 accounts that are involved, CS was one but I am not 100% sure who the second one is but their are several possible candidates) 
* Credit Suisse is now owned and operated by UBS
* Fast forward to 2025 and UBS financial auditor have expressed an ""adverse opinion"" on the bank's internal controls over its financial reporting for 2024 after it failed to resolve issues related to misstatements inherited from Credit Suisse, the Swiss lender said on Monday, Mar 17, 2025

That said; my back hurts. all day, everyday. I just went to my 2nd Physical Therapy appointment, which is new. I am on week two of extensive back stretching. I do about 20 minutes of stretches in the morning and about 15 minutes in the evening. I must admit, my back muscles feel better than they have in years. However; my lower spine and hips still hurt. Ibuprofen doesn't seem to lover the pain at all. I haven't tried Tylenol in a while so I'm not sure if that works, but even if it did, talking Tylenol everyday sounds like it's bad for the kidneys or liver. I don't know, I'm not well educated on that.

I was watching an ad for chiropractors, because I was considering it, and saw this thing called a **Thompson drop-table** being used and I did a Hick maneuver without thinking. It was like my brain was feeling artificial relief watching that motion happen.

I sleep with my knees curled up to my chest because my brain things this helps reduce pain at night. Truth be told it doesn't.

The only thing that has ever taken the pain away was when I asked someone to put their palm on my tail bone and put their full body weight on it. That lasted about 10 seconds, which felt great, however; when they let up it was super painful. The down motion felt great but the up motion was so bad.

I haven't asked my doctor for pain medication. I am considering it but I don't want to be *altered* all the time, especially of there are side affects, specifically long term. I want to live into my 80's, at least.

Is there something I can do to reduce my pain without medication? Is there a certain stretch, or a vitamin, or a food, or a diet, or a \_\_\_\_\_? I feel like this is a stupid question. I feel like ""Of course there's not a diet that reduces spinal pain."" But I don't know what else or where else to ask. Best case scenario someone smarter tan me opens my eyes to \_\_\_\_\_.

I thought our 13w old was a good sleeper up until the last few weeks because she has always been pretty good about going down in her bassinet or crib at night independently. However, she started showing signs of rolling around 9w and we‚Äôve been transitioning her from being swaddled by having one arm out, which has been going pretty well. She still startles herself, but is able to put herself back to sleep sometimes. We put a sock on her free hand so that if she hits her face, it‚Äôs soft.

For the last few weeks, though, she‚Äôll sleep one 3 hour stretch and then wake every 60-90 min the rest of the night. I hate to admit that the 5 times she‚Äôs slept more than 4 hours are days when I‚Äôve had a couple glasses of wine. I track her sleep in the Huckleberry and we follow approximately 75-90 min wake windows. She is in the 70th percentile of weight, happy baby during the day, EBF, no reflux. She sleeps in her own room in the crib that is dark, noise machine, 71degrees. I only have one cup of coffee per day. I just don‚Äôt understand why her sleep seems to be getting worse over time. She used to only wake 3 times per night to feed and now it‚Äôs like 5-6 times.

We‚Äôve tried feeding her a bottle an hour or so before bedtime routine with a nursing top off and that hasn‚Äôt helped. Should I try to give a formula bottle before bed? Is there anything I can do? Is this the 4 month sleep regression early or will things get even worse next month? 

I think we‚Äôre going to start Ferber right at 16w. I just need advice until then. ",0,1743953512.0,newborns,0,0.5,False

 Room 1 was completed working with my inventory on hand (except for the furry chairs cause they matched the furry bench). 



 In room 2, I knew the darker blue was risky but I was pulling colors from the horizon. That cheap rug was the best rug I could find/ afford for the space.



In room 3, I loved the rug effect that I created and those chairs. ( There were similar "" coastal"" chairs but they were more expensive). I was struggling with not using duplicate artwork and I only had 2 compasses and one of the waves. In hindsight, I should have left out the compass altogether.



In room 4, I left out a plant on the left because it obscured the lovely tidal pool ( the space was too bare to leave the plant out on the right). It was an expensive all- out LE fest for sure!



In room 5, I think there were major scale problems...mostly on DHs part, but I believe that  coffee table is too small and was used as it fit the requirement. All in all I was pleased as  I tend to dislike designing traditional rooms.

Knick knacks on the tv entertainment center will also be moved and rearranged for a more aesthetically pleasing look. Hopefully we‚Äòll get a new entertainment center that will match the space better, in time.

Not Stockholm, not Malm√∂, just Gothenburg. [I used to scroll through sites like this one](https://www.bokadirekt.se/places/kaloriraknare-129167), imagining what it‚Äôd feel like to finally book something real. I don‚Äôt even know why. Maybe it was a photo I saw once‚Äîsome glossy magazine spread with a woman floating in a candlelit pool under a high stone arch, steam curling up around her like it had nowhere better to be. I think I was about 11. The magazine was from 1998, and I remember tearing out the page and folding it into a tiny square I kept in my sock drawer for years.

It took me 20 years and 4 different jobs to finally go. I‚Äôd saved $9,600 in total, most of it from skipping takeout and brewing my own coffee‚Äîat last count, 2,183 homemade cups. My final spreadsheet had 47 entries just for ‚ÄúGothenburg stuff.‚Äù When I landed at Landvetter Airport, it was a Tuesday, 3:14 p.m. local time, temperature 6¬∞C. I‚Äôd only slept 4 hours on the plane, but the adrenaline had taken over. My bag weighed 18.7 kg, which the woman at the SAS counter had reminded me with a deadpan ‚ÄúJust under the limit.‚Äù

I took bus 91 to the city. The driver had ABBA playing quietly‚Äî""Knowing Me, Knowing You."" I checked into a small boutique hotel near Kungsportsavenyen. Room 302. No view, but I didn‚Äôt care. My focus was on Hagabadet. It's a 19th-century bathhouse turned modern spa, and they say the water is maintained at exactly 36.5¬∞C. There‚Äôs a salt pool, an aroma sauna, and something called a ""mindfulness rain shower,"" which sounded vaguely ridiculous but I was all in. I booked the signature massage package: 80 minutes, 895 SEK. The masseuse, a guy named Erik who said he used to be a carpenter, worked my back like he was restoring an old farmhouse.

Somewhere between the hot stone placement and the peppermint oil, I felt every spreadsheet, every Uber skipped, every passive-aggressive family comment about ‚Äúthat Sweden thing‚Äù just melt. There‚Äôs a point in a massage, I think it‚Äôs around minute 47, where time stops being real and your bones forget they have jobs. Erik told me later that most clients fall asleep. I didn‚Äôt‚ÄîI counted 126 ceiling tiles instead.

Afterward, I sat in the spa caf√© with a tiny espresso and a slice of raw chocolate cake that had 12 ingredients I couldn‚Äôt pronounce. The woman beside me said she‚Äôd lived in Gothenburg her whole life and still came to Hagabadet once a month. ‚ÄúIt resets you,‚Äù she said. I believed her. I left the spa 4 hours later, having spoken 37 Swedish words (6 of them correctly), and feeling like I‚Äôd done something deeply irrational and absolutely right.

I think I‚Äôll come back in 973 days. I already started a new spreadsheet. ",1,1743952708.0,u_Rampant_Surveyor,0,1.0,False

Full story: I‚Äôm going to be straight up: I‚Äôm not a roaster. Never tried it. Im just a dude who likes coffee. This is my first post in this sub, so maybe it‚Äôs an issue that‚Äôs been raised before. But it‚Äôs worth mentioning again. Commercial and recreational roasters alike: STOP OVER-ROASTING YOUR BEANS!

I came of age in my coffee snobbery era in Melbourne, Australia, where I was very lucky to be exposed to many excellent roasters and amazing coffee.

I‚Äôm now in the USA, where there are of course great roasters as well, but they‚Äôre not as easy to find. That has been my experience across several major cities. 

One difference in norms I‚Äôve noticed between places is that in Melbourne, beans are either labeled ‚Äòfilter roast‚Äô or ‚Äòespresso roast‚Äô. I understand that it‚Äôs a spectrum and this is a false dichotomy. But if I went to a reputable roaster and got some single origin espresso roast, I could be confident that it would taste good straight out of my mocha pot or (later) Breville Barista Pro, nothing added. 

Contrast that with the USA, where the trend seems to be labelling beans as light roast, medium roast, or dark roast, sometimes including a sliding scale, sometimes not. 

This is where the problem lies. What these American roasters are calling medium roast is often not, in fact, medium roast.

I just picked up an organic single origin Peru in FL, 2 weeks from roasted date, labeled medium roast. Brewed in the mocha pot. Served black.

By medium roast, I think they must have meant darker than the blackest pits of hell. 

I could not stomach this thing. Added ice - nope. I‚Äôm not going to add milk while I‚Äôm fasting, don‚Äôt tell me to. I even got some acid reflux. I think that only happened once in my life when I drank roughly 37 beers during a bachelor party weekend.

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm preaching to the choir here for some of you, but hopefully this hits home for others who are new to the game, or maybe even some roast commercially but actually don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing.

Please. Roast lighter.

More than a hundred thousand people turned out in Boston, marching and standing in the rain for hours to show their determination.

There is power in numbers. People need to see they aren't alone. They need to see there is nothing to fear from this wannabe tyrant. Trump is only as powerful as we are weak. So we need to roar him down, show the whole world America is against him.

What are some ways we can boost our numbers? Here are a couple of ideas. You must have better ones.

**A pre-protest**

A week before the next mass protest, launch an informational protest where people walk around their towns and cities with signs, letting people know where and when the protest will take place. Hand out flyers. Post messages in libraries and coffee shops. Knock on doors. We think everyone knows these mass protests are coming, but that's only because we are in an information bubble. Most people have no idea. When they hear about them, they want to join in.

**A competition for the highest turnout**

The informational protest could be motivated by a competition to turn out protesters. Tell the media about the competition a week before the next mass protest so they will report on it. Get people enthusiastic about turning out more protesters than their rival towns and cities. And after the next mass protest takes place, post the official results on web sites.

‚Ä¢Age: 23 (turning 24)

‚Ä¢Gender: Male

‚Ä¢Location: Iloilo City, Jaro.

‚Ä¢Employment Status: Working full time in a tech job and financially stable for now.

‚Ä¢Hobbies: Archery, Reading books, Cooking, and anime/manga/manhwa.

‚Ä¢About me: I've been told that I'm witty, funny and sarcastic. I like to think that I'm good with conversations, patient, and emotionally intelligent. I'm good at listening to your problems, talking to you about my (or your) hobbies, and I like to think that I'm interesting.

I'm 5'6, on the heavy side (but not morbidly obese). I jog with my friends on weekdays, shoot arrows at the range and hang out with people on weekends. I love to talk about anything and everything. I love getting to know new people, learn about their hobbies and what they like to do.

Preferences:

‚Ä¢Age range: 20-28. I don't put too much stock into age. I like people who have hobbies, no matter what they are. I think it's really cool if you're passionate about something, whether that's something mundane like rock collectiong, or extreme sports.

I value personality over looks, for the most part. What's important is that we can talk, vibe and enjoy the time we spend together. If you're comfortable, we can exchange pics after some light conversation to see if we like each other. Be warned however, that my personality is definitely better than my looks HAHAHA ü§£ 

‚Ä¢Relationship Goals: We can start off casual. We go get some coffee, talk about our lives, and then go for a romantic walk along the esplanade, under a beautiful moonlit sky.

We can take our time and keep things casual, for a while before we progress to something serious

üü¢ Pros of dating me:

I can cook your favorite dish.
I bring flowers to the first date.
I'm great at both talking and listening.
I get along with everyone. I love making new friends, and I have lots of friend groups. I will absolutely get along with your friends.

üî¥ Cons of dating me:

I work morning shifts (6am), and my saturdays are usually reserved for training.

I'm a little clingy, but I know how to manage it.

I will drag you around from archery ranges, to museums, to cozy little cafes with no rhyme or reason to the order.

I inherently do about 12-14k steps a day, plus I‚Äôm climbing in and out of a semi trailer as well as pushing pallets up to 2,500lbs around so I knew if I could just get my calorie intake under control I could lose some weight.

Temps I‚Äôve tried: 
88-94 bitter
85 less bitter/better
82- dull/muted

Used from a medium, medium coarse to coarse grind sizes.

Water: RO with PCW, adding aquafina (tds of 2ppm) on top to reduce tds.

Ratio: I‚Äôve been using 1-14 and 1-13.5 lately.

Today I tried a coarse grind size or between a coarse and medium coarse with a 1:13.5 ratio but the coffee lacks more flavour but I can also taste that fruity bitterness. I can‚Äôt really tell if it tastes more bitter because of the lack of clarity. I‚Äôm wondering if it has anything to do with using 1 degree lower temp (84 instead of 85c) or if it‚Äôs because I started adding a bit of Aquafina to the water dissolved with mineral packets; I started doing that yesterday.

I don't know how to exactly put it since I'm not a native english speaker, but I've had a psychomotor screening as a child, which showed lower attention than average, but not enough to be ADHD. I however do have ASD.

Anyways, they said some stuff about how I'm able to get an intense focus on dumb stuff or stuff I like, but on the other hand easily wander around when it comes to work on stuff I don't like.

So now that I'm 18 and struggling in college hating most of what I do, I thought to myself it'd be great if there was a way to enhance my focus.

So far here's what I've been through :

\- Exercising for 1h30 4 times a week (I love it. Dunno if it enhances my mental clarity, but I love the progress I'm making with my body nonetheless)

\- Vaping, nicotine pouches - Since Nicotine is a stimulant, it actually has some degree of beneficial effects on focus. I felt an intense mental clarity when I took it the first time. It was like ""silence"". For the first time since middle school, where it had actually happened, I felt like my mind was blank, in a good way. I stopped after almost fainting due to a nicotine-induced panic attack.

My issue with nicotine is how quick the tolerance goes up and down. Take it for three days ? You'll need pouches to feel the clarity. Cut it for three days? A 4mg pouch will knock you out. So I stopped.

\- Coffee - Meh, not that good + hurts my stomach. I can have a Monster Energy drink and go to sleep right after it, it really is nothing compared to the nic.

\- Tea - Doesn't hurt my stomach as much, doesn't skyrocket my stress, it's better.



Reading NCBI, I found that meditation would supposedly help with focus. So I have a couple questions :  
\- Can you go through your daily tasks thinking about your breathing in order to meditate or do you actually have to sit and close your eyes?

\- Have you perceived that kind of positive effects on your mental clarity after practicing meditation?",2,1743951911.0,Meditation,0,1.0,False

When I didn't get a response on that, the following day I mentioned to her that I'll be travelling to my hometown the day after so that we can plan the meetup accordingly. As she had some office work we couldn't meet but we were interacting on Instagram where I would reply to her stories and have some conversation. When she got back, I had texted her on Instagram but she hadn't seen my message. I thought she might be busy but the very next day she was posting stories (smh). I again sent a reel and then she replied to me after a day and said that she was very busy with some stuff and couldn't get time to respond. She again asked me if I would like to go out for coffee. I said would love to and asked her for some time to figure out a place. I said I'd like to talk over a call to finalize on where and how we were meeting. She gave her number; I texted her on WhatsApp, got a response and then I asked for a call and again no response. I thought maybe she didn't want to talk over call so I sent her the idea that I had in my mind for our date (ut was something related to our mutual interest to make the date fun and not just coffee). She responded after 12+ hours that she slept early and then mentioned that she was sorry that she would not be able to come for the date as she had to go to her hometown for some occasion. I said it's okay and that we'll meet when she's back (but again no response on that message). Bruh wtf.

She had beef with one of the other girls in the flat and they always went at it arguing about petty stuff. I wasn't too involved as I have a lot of friends outside and usually spent time with them. I also ate out a lot and hardly used the kitchen, which is the only shared space in the house.

She's always been on friendly terms with me so I've always kept her at an arm's reach. Not too friendly, not too unfriendly. Recently, she brought up the fact that a lot of ingredients in the kitchen kept going missing - stuff like salt, sugar, oil etc. She was upset as she's been really broke and can barely afford groceries, I empathized with her at that point. A couple weeks later, I noticed a lot of my ingredients going missing too. Like I said, I don't cook very often and barely use things but i noticed that my coffee, garlic powder, sugar and my olive oil were all gone. I mentioned it to her at some point because I knew she'd been struggling with the same issue.

At this point she got very defensive and started justifying that it wasn't her, which made me suspicious but I decided to just let it go. When I restocked my stuff, I just decided to keep stuff in my room. A few days after this, I really wanted to do my laundry and hadn't been able to get a hold of the shared washing machine all week. It is usually Bianca who always has her stuff in there and I really needed my washing to be done. I put a message on the group chat asking if we could make a rota for it, so it's more fair to everyone. 

The morning after, I was in the kitchen when Bianca came in. I thought she would take her laundry out so I could put mine in. She said she still needs to do her uniform. I simply accepted my fate and said ""Oh, are you going to put it in right after?"". At this point she started yelling at me saying I leave the kitchen messy everyday (as I mentioned, I eat out 2/3 meals a day and hardly am ever in the kitchen) and she said I told her about my missing ingredients because I thought it was her - which isn't true. 

I know now that she's going to do to me what she did to the other girl in the first semester, and i don't want to deal with it. I could be petty and fight back but it really wouldn't solve much. What should I do?

1jsw2v3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1jsw2v3/does_anyone_have_a_link_to_this_novel/,Does anyone have a link to this novel?,"Help please need a link I think the title is ""running from my mate""

""Mommy, will I have a mate when I grow up?""

My head snapped up to look at beautiful grey eyes which mirrored mine. Not only that. Almost all her features were similar to mine, just in a smaller version.

She was Cherry Houston, my beloved daughter. ""Yes, honey. Goddess will send one to you."" I answered, giving her the warmest smile. She was almost four and on the stage of having a lot of curiosity about everything. This made me prepare myself for her next question.

""I don't want one.""

Her reply slightly took me aback. Girls were usually excited when talking about finding their future mates. At least, it was what I felt when the little me imagined my man in the white horse. ""Why?""

""Because Daddy hurt and always makes you cry. I don't want to cry every day, Mommy.""

I swallowed hard. Cherry's words were like a giant stone was thrown at me. It was like a realization that my misery had affected her deeply.

I stood up, making the screeching sound of the chair from an abrupt movement. But I didn't care, even if it fell on the ground. My daughter was more important as I rushed and sat beside her.

I extended my hand to stroke her cheek. ""You won't, honey. You will get a very kind person who will treat you like a queen. He will love you and protect you with his life."" I consoled her.

I always wished for her to get a different fate than mine. Having a happy life and family and no sorrow cry‚Äîsomething I didn't have or used to have.

Cherry stretched her little arm, mirroring what I was doing by touching my face. ""Does it hurt?"" She asked. Her cute finger landed on my bruise, carefully pointing it. Her eyes flitted with sadness as if she also felt the pain I got from her father.

Yes. It was my husband, my mate doing this to me.

""No, baby. It's healing now."" I lied, or maybe not. All the pain was like disappearing in front of her.

""I hope Daddy won't come back so you won't get hurt anymore.""

My husband, Ian Huston, an Alpha of the Lake Pack, was on a business trip to another pack. He said it was only for three days. But it was day four, and he was still nowhere in the pack house, though it relieved me because there was no beating, shouting, or crying during his absence.

My life actually didn't suck at first. Ian was kind and treated me well in the first stage of our relationship. We met at a mating party like other mates' stories. We fell in love and decided to get married there months later although, in fact, we had been living together since day one. It was just a ceremony because Ian was an Alpha, automatically making me a Luna.

Then I was pregnant, and it completed our happy life. I had all I wished for‚Äîa lovely mate and, soon, a pup.

However, everything turned upside down the moment I gave birth to Cherry‚Äîa daughter, not a son. Soon, I learned the dark side of the Hustons. They were rarely blessed with a son‚ÄîIan's mother had born to two daughters before Ian came to her, and after him, it was another daughter. So when I couldn't give the Hustons a son, an heir, my mate began to insult and humiliate me. Then one day, he started landing a punch on me, which worsened as the days passed.

His family pushed me to give him a son as soon as possible. But I couldn't do it because my body was weak due to constant abuse. I hurt physically and mentally.

Then why was I still staying after all the pain he caused me?

I wasn't. I once tried to free myself from this agony.

I offered a divorce or a rejection, but he refused right away. His ego wouldn't let him do that, as he didn't want to be the first Alpha to cut the mate bond. It would put him in nasty gossip.

I was angry, only to find myself being imprisoned in this house and becoming a punching bag whenever he vented out of his anger.

Those had been my life for the past three and a half years.

I wiped tears forming in the corner of my eyes. I couldn't let my daughter see me crying. ""Mommy is fine, sweetheart,"" I reassured her one last time before suddenly the smell reached my nose.

Ian was back.

And I must move fast.

""You're done with your dinner, right?"" I asked her while putting down the napkin tucked on her neck, though I knew her spaghetti was still half-eaten. But I couldn't wait any longer and forced her to stand up. I was in a hurry, or Ian would see us. ""Let's go to your room. It's bedtime.""

I carried her in my arms and ran up the stairs to reach her room faster.

""Now, close your eyes and-""

""Don't make a noise."" Cherry finished my words while clutching the blanket. She blinked a few times, but her eyes still flashed with a nonstop worry. ""Is Daddy home?""

I smiled despite my anxiety about my fate for the next few minutes. ""Yes, and you know what to do.""

""Always stay in my room and pretend to be asleep.""

""Yes."" I pinched her nose lightly. ""You're such a clever girl.""

But my compliment seemed couldn't wash her worry away. ""Can you stay with me?"" She was pleading with her eyes and voice.

""No, honey. But I promise I'll be here when you wake up.""

She merely looked at me before I heard her little voice again. ""Promise?"" She extended her hand and showed me her pinkie.

I did the same and entwined our fingers. ""Promise.""

I stayed a minute longer, saying goodnight and sharing hugs and kisses before deciding it was time to leave her and face my fate which Goddess threw at me.

""You're drunk."" I pointed as I entered our room, and the smell of alcohol swirled around. But I frowned my forehead when another scent hit me.

I smelled a female, and it was definitely not me.

I closed the door and walked to the bed as if nothing had happened. Wasn't I jealous?

Of course. But it was long ago.

I had spotted him coming home like this many times until I felt numb. In fact, I already closed my heart the moment he refused his own daughter's presence.

""It's none of your business."" He chuckled in a disgusting way, which made me want to spit out. But I only swallowed it because speaking with him in such a condition was useless.

Thus, I kept walking without looking at him.

Unfortunately, it didn't sit well with him as I heard rushed steps in my direction. And before I realized the situation, he had already turned my body around, so we faced each other. His breath was fanning my face, and I wanted to vomit, inhaling it.

""That's it? You only said I'm drunk?"" He gritted. Anger radiated on his face.

""What were you expecting?"" I asked him back. I usually didn't respond to him, as I knew how it would end. He would beat me no matter what I said, even when I begged him to stop.

But he suddenly changed his expression and looked at me up and down while licking his lips. ""You're stripping off.""

I rolled my eyes annoyingly. How could Ian demand sex when he already had one with whom I didn't know?

""You're drunk."" I turned around. However, it was the wrong move because I felt a pull on my arm, and a second later, I saw the anger on his face was back.

""That's not how you answer your mate. You must follow my every word.""

Just as he said it, I heard a ripping sound. My eyes widened before they fell down, and I found a big hole in the front of my shirt. It caused my bra to be half visible.

Then he grasped my chin, forcing me to look at him. Without notice, he moved forward, crushing his lips onto mine. He was kissing me bruisingly hard, biting my lip when I refused to kiss him back until I tasted my own blood.

I fought back. I tried to push Ian away, but he managed to lock my hands while he continued to assault my lips. He secured my position by caging my body tightly, leaving no room for me to free myself.

My eyes watered from his actions, especially when he began rubbing his calloused palm under my dress.

No.

I had let go of myself.

So I bit his lip hard and used all my energy to push him away.

He was staggering after the link was broken. He licked his lips, and soon, his eyes became black as he realized he was bleeding from what I did.

Oh, Goddess! This wasn't going well!

I rushed to the door. My plan was, undoubtedly, to escape his wrath.

However, I had never been faster than an Alpha. He grabbed my hair, tugged it, and then slapped my face, which caused me to knock the edge of the nightstand and fall to the ground.

""How dare you fight me!"" He stood before me as if guarding me so I couldn't run away while his hand started unbuckling his pants.

I blazed a glare. "" you, Ian!"" I shouted back but regretted it as soon as my gaze landed on something far behind him. The door opened slightly, and I saw glowing greys in the darkness.

Cherry!

I was stunned in place even when he, again, ripped my dress. And when he forced himself on top of me, the door was wide open.

""Mommy!""

The call brought back my sense. I looked at Ian, now staring at our daughter with his eyes black and rage rising from his body. He clearly hated being interrupted.

""No, Cherry! Don't come here! Go back to your room!""

..............................................................................
CARLA

""No, Cherry! Don't come here! Go back to your room!"" I yelled to prevent my daughter from coming to my place.

But what could a four-year-old girl do in this situation?

She might think being in her mother's arms was safer, although it meant she would run straight into the crime scene.

""Mommy."" She slipped below Ian, and I immediately caught her in my arms. Tears were welling in her eyes.

""Shh, baby. Everything is alright."" I was comforting her while hiding her fragile body behind mine. I must protect her from the danger, which was her own father.

""Children should be in their bedroom, not here,"" Ian growled. He walked closer, and my hold on Cherry tightened.

""I want to be with Mommy.""

But her words weren't affecting him. He gripped her arm and pulled her hard. So I was slowly losing her.

""No, Ian. Let me bring her to her room."" I was pleading in desperation. I would never leave Cherry alone with him!

Again, he didn't listen to my words and our daughter's cry. Instead, he pulled Cherry harder, and I completely lost her.

""No, Mommy!"" She screamed, which made his anger rise up.

Ian dragged her a bit, only to throw her on the ground. ""You should listen to Daddy, not Mommy.""

Then everything went fast.

I saw Ian lifting his hand, ready to hit her, and the mother instinct inside me kicked in. I picked up the lampstand. And before I realized everything, I swung it to his head with all my might. My impulsive action must have hit hard, so he lost his balance and fainted.

But I kept my guard on until seconds later, and he was still lying on the ground. He really fainted.

Only then did I release my grip on the lampstand and hold Cherry. ""Shh, baby. Everything is alright now."" I replayed the same words I usually used to calm her down whenever this situation happened. I knew she was terrified, but I didn't know how to comfort her except for the promise that everything was going fine.

I hoped I could keep my promise somehow.

I looked at my fainted mate while stroking Cherry's hair in my embrace. My brain was working on the future. Ian definitely wouldn't let us go when he woke up. He probably did worse after learning about my rebellion.

It wasn't merely about my fate here but also my daughter's. He could do everything to me, punishing and beating me. But he couldn't hurt Cherry. She was the only reason I was still alive.

I was her mother and must protect her with my life.

My gaze shifted back to Cherry, who was crying in my arms. Maybe it was time to wash the tears away. As she wished, it was probably the right time to get rid of this  life.

""Cherry, honey,"" I called for her attention. If I really wanted to make this happen, I must do it quickly. ""You said you wanted to visit the theme park, right?""

Cherry was still sobbing but tilted her head up and nodded at my question.

""Let's visit that.""

""Really?""

I nodded and then gave a wide smile. ""Yes. But we must go now so we can arrive in the morning.""

And like other children, when they got permission to play around, her face was slightly lit up. ""Can I bring Choco?""

Choco was her favorite bear doll.

""Of course. Now, get up and go get her."" I helped my daughter stand up and fix her clothes.

But she didn't move and only stared at the unmoved Ian. ""How about Daddy?"" Fear flitted in her voice.

""Let's leave Daddy and the house quietly. Remember, we must go now.""

""Yes, now."" She copied my words in a more confident tone. Then she slowly walked and began running after passing Ian's body.

I saw her leaving the door open before fixing myself. I noticed blood on my head‚Äîit must have resulted from a bump on the nightstand. It wasn't a big wound, so I left it like that.

I proceeded to the closet and picked a quite big duffel bag. For the next five-minute, I was busy stuffing my clothes into the bag and other basic necessities, including some cash I hid in case this opportunity came.

And finally, it happened, so I emptied the hidden storage before moving into Cherry's room.

""You only want to bring Choco with you?"" I asked while putting Cherry's clothes inside the bag.

""Yes.""

""Wear your jacket, please,"" I ordered after glancing at her, and she hadn't put a jacket on. She already had shoes, though.

I heard a movement telling me she had complied with my order.

""Ready?""

She nodded her head. ""Ready, Mommy.""

Thus, the next thing I did was to carry her as I made my way out of the pack house. It was almost midnight, and there was no activity in the house. That was why I could leave the house without a problem and no one spotting us.

I was running on my feet toward the border‚Äîit was the only option because I couldn't possibly shift. Someone could easily notice us in my bigger form, though it must be faster to reach the border. However, I didn't want to take the risk. I wanted this to succeed. If this failed, then our fate would fail, too.

After five years of living in this pack, I learned that warriors would run the perimeter once an hour. There would be a gap between when warriors left the post and before others came to occupy it. And that was my way out.

I almost reached the border and already had warriors in sight when suddenly a hand pulling me. I was utterly shocked because it was Tricia, Ian's younger sister.

""What are you doing here?"" She asked in a hushed tone, looking at Cherry and me alternately.

I swallowed hard. What should I tell Tricia? I ran away from her brother? Impossible!

""Cherry couldn't sleep, so,"" I paused before completing my story. ""So, bring her to walk around.""

Stupid me! How could I make such a lie? No one would believe it.

There was silence for a few seconds as I waited for her reaction. I could feel nervousness slowly eating me.

Tricia raised her hand, which I initially thought would grab mine. But instead, she pointed to a fresh wound on my head. ""Did Ian beat you again?""

The story of the Alpha of this pack abusing his Luna wasn't new. His family knew it, as well as his people.

I smiled weakly and said, ""It's okay."" The same answer I would give to whoever asked about my condition. Unfortunately, only a few people were concerned about me. ""I will return home then."" I continued.

I guessed the plan had failed. So did my hope. There was no freedom for my daughter and me.

""Wait."" She stopped me, which made me look back at her. ""Take this."" She grabbed my hand and then left something there. It was a car key.

I watched my hand, then Tricia. My brows furrowed in confusion.

""The one guarding the entrance is the warrior leader. You know he's always cautious. And he won't believe whatever reason you give."" She started explaining. ""But if you take my car, he won't stop you as he often sees me leaving the territory.""

Only then did I realize there was a car nearby.

""I know what you're going to do, Carla. And I really hope it succeeds.""

I looked at her with mixed emotions, as I didn't know what to say. I rarely talked to her and thought she was the same as Ian's other sisters. Turned out she was willing to help me.

Tricia put a hat on my head before hugging me. ""You should have done this sooner when he abused you for the first time. You and Cherry deserve a better life than stuck beside him.""

A lone tear trickled down my eyes. ""Thank you, Tris.""

We stayed in this position for a few moments without no one speaking until Tricia pulled away.

""Take care of my niece."" She said while staring warmly at Cherry. Then she spun around and left us.

I couldn't even say goodbye to her.

I looked in her direction until her figure disappeared into the dark forest, and I couldn't see her anymore. I wasted no more time and proceeded to the car.

I found a blanket in the backseat, which I could use to cover Cherry's body. Then I placed the bag underneath the seat before taking the driver's seat.

This was it. Now or never.

I slowly drove the car toward the entrance. However, I couldn't help my heart from beating fast as I approached the warriors.

Of course, they noticed us. But Tricia was right. They might see her often leaving the territory, so no one stopped the car. And it was real freedom when we could pass the border safely.

I looked at the rearview, and a glimpse of Cherry's face sleeping soundly was visible. I smiled in joy. Although I still didn't know where to go, it was the freedom I was waiting for and promised her.

It was real now.

..............................................................................
CARLA

I kept driving for I didn't know how long. All I knew was I had to go away as far as possible so no one from Lake Pack, especially Ian would find us.

But my option was limited. I couldn't possibly go to other packs. Who was I? I wasn't part of their packs. Also, they would recognize me as Luna of Lake Pack and would definitely tell Ian. Then all my effort to run away was in vain.

What about my old pack?

Well, I had thought about it. My family would undoubtedly accept me back if I told them everything. However, it was too far from here as I was from a different continent. Besides, it was a small pack. We were too fragile to fight Ian's wrath.

Then, where should we go?

I let out a heavy sigh. The only choice was to keep driving until... I didn't know.

""Mommy."" A small voice came into my hearing. ""Have we arrived at the theme park?"" It was my daughter. She was awake.

I looked at the mirror above the dashboard and saw Cherry rubbing her eyes with both hands. She was still lying, covered by the blanket. ""Morning, sweetheart."" I greeted cheerfully. Looking at her was like erasing the burden on my shoulders. ""Not yet. But we'll arrive there soon."" Her question reminded me to stop in the nearby city to keep my promise.

She was trying to get up, causing the blanket to fall, and now revealing her full small figure. ""I'm hungry, Mommy.""

Right.

I must have been too focused on how to escape as soon as possible that I forgot to bring food, even water. I gazed around, hoping to find a restaurant. If not, just a food truck was okay, too.

But nothing. There was only a road and a forest.

""Can you wait? Mommy will find a restaurant soon."" Just a convenience store was enough as long as it sold food.

And I found one. A pretty big restaurant that was already open in the early morning.

I slowed down the car as we approached the place and parked in an empty spot. Turned out it was pretty crowded. There were few cars, and I could see people coming and leaving.

And I knew why the moment I stepped out of the car. I smelled unfamiliar wolves.

We must have been near a pack because they smelled the same. Or I unintentionally crossed the border.

I swallowed hard. I shouldn't have been here.

I turned around, only to feel a tiny hand on mine. Cherry was already outside, clamping Choco in her arms.

""Choco is hungry too."" She chirped, her eyes twinkling.

I swallowed an invisible lump for the second time. There was no turning back. My child needed to eat.

Therefore, I continued the plan.

""Let's go.""

We walked hand in hand toward the building. I could smell butter, toast, egg, coffee, milk, and more as we were getting closer. I subconsciously licked my lips.

It seemed I was also hungry.

I opened the door, and all eyes instantly fell on my daughter and me. Some had a frown on their foreheads, and others just glanced at us, but I knew they had their guard on.

After all, we were an outsider.

""Cookies!"" Cherry exclaimed excitedly, slipping from my grip, and ran to the counter displaying cake and cookies. ""Mom, can we have a cookie?"" She asked, but her sight was set on them. Cookie was always her favorite.

I lowered my hat so it would cover my eyes from the surrounding. If I wanted to do this, I needed to be bold, and setting my focus only on Cherry was the best way. ""Yes, honey,"" I responded as I took steps closer to the counter. The staff was waiting for me. ""I want two sets of breakfast and milk,"" I told the staff. ""And cookies, please.""

She was silent for a few seconds as if scanning me before finally answering. ""You want to eat here or takeaway?""

I looked at my daughter, whose eyes were still on the cookie. ""We want to eat here.""

Less than ten minutes later, my order came. Cherry was chewing sausage, causing both cheeks to puff while I ate mine. It was, indeed, nice to see her enjoying the food.

But it didn't erase my nervousness, which was getting more potent. My skin felt like burning from the people's gaze. And the smile on my face completely disappeared when I sensed a strong aura. It wasn't from an ordinary wolf or warrior.

""Honey, can you eat faster? We need to leave soon."" I said as I began putting my food‚ÄîI lost appetite‚Äîinside the cookie bag. It was better to resume eating in the car instead of here.

""Is the theme park already open?"" Cherry answered with a full mouth.

""Yes. We will have much time to play around if we arrive soon.""

Cherry looked excited, which made her take a big bite of toast and try to chew quicker.

However, Goddess knew how fast a child could finish their meal. It almost spent the whole mealtime.

""Can we save the rest for our ride? You can finish it later.""

She nodded her head at the exact time I heard a voice.

""Hi, there.""

My body stiffened, recognizing it was from the strong aura.

""Do you mind if I join?""

I was silent, but the male still did what he asked for. He sat next to my daughter.

""This is the first time I see you around here. May I know you?""

Still no answer. I continued doing what I was doing and now put Cherry's food into the bag.

""Hi, lovely."" But he didn't give up. He greeted Cherry instead. ""What's your name?"" He asked, which caused Cherry to be confused and shift her attention between him and me.

I wanted to stop her from replying to him. But I also didn't want to make scenes that would disadvantage our situation more. Hence, I let Cherry answer him.

""Cherry."" My daughter said softly and hesitantly.

""Nice name, Cherry."" He showed a wide smile. ""Why are you and your mom here? Do you know where you're from?""

That was it. I couldn't take any longer.

""We want to go to the theme park. And-""

I abruptly stood up and, in an instant, went to Cherry's side, hugging her as I hurriedly walked toward the entrance.

""I only want to know where you're from. Nothing will harm you if you just tell me that.""

But I didn't give a shit. We were in the running, and if the male knew where we were running from, he might call Ian. Then there would not be a chance like this anymore.

I kept striding my way in faster and longer steps, completely ignoring him. Soon, I heard a growl behind me.

I must have been annoying him.

The door was only a meter ahead when it suddenly opened. A male came inside, and the world was fading away the moment I saw the most beautiful blue eyes I had ever seen. They were so clear, like a clear blue sky and glowing, although we were not in darkness.

But then, something hit me hard and forced me back to reality. I felt a powerful aura stronger than the male behind me. And it was Alpha aura.

Shit!

 I get it, he's excited and wants the best for our baby, but it's starting to feel like he's controlling my every move.

The latest thing is that he's hired a nutritionist to plan out my meals. At first, I thought it was sweet and caring, but now I'm starting to dread food. 

The nutritionist has me on this super restrictive diet that's all about veggies, fruits, and nuts and grains.

 Don't get me wrong, I'm a vegetarian and I love healthy food, but this is taking it to a whole new level.

I'm not even allowed to have a tub of ice cream or a slice of cake once in a month.

And the worst part is, the food is just so boring. I'm talking mashed veggies, bread, and fruit salad every day. It's like eating a six months old kids food.

 I've asked the nutritionist if she can mix it up a bit, but she just says she's the ""professional"" and I should trust her.

Yesterday, I was out with friends and they all ordered coffee and hearty lunch. I was resent ful.

 I had to sit there and watch them eat while I had to wait till later to go home and eat the bland food.

My friends think my husband is controlling.

I'm scared to bring it up with my husband because I don't want him to think I'm being ungrateful or that I'm not taking care of myself. 

But honestly, I'm feeling really nauseous and I have no appetite. I also started having this habit of crying in the bathroom after trying to force feed myself the food she makes.

I just want to enjoy food again without feeling like I'm being monitored.

However, one of the drawbacks of prototyping in concrete, cement, plaster, or stabilized earth is that your prototypes are inevitably going to be unusable in one manner or another AND made of massive, non-recyclable materials. The experimental process creates heavy trash.

Along the way I realized that I could experiment with multipart mold designs while making bars of soap instead. By using ‚Äúmelt and pour‚Äù bulk soap on Amazon I could find what works and what needed further optimization before designing for silicone or concrete. 

Obviously, I‚Äôm not making concrete bars with the same mold designs. But, the lessons about layer line transfer, overhang design, planned post-processing operations, and relief zones translate.

Other positive results:
-each casting costs less than a Dove bar
-materials don‚Äôt need to be purchased 90lbs at a time
-it can be used for its intended purpose whether it turned out perfectly or not 
-it literally lets me wash away the sins of prototyping

The party was on at a Saudi-backed LIV Golf tournament at the president‚Äôs Doral resort in Florida and a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago, even as markets tumbled.

LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed league, has sponsored a tournament at the Trump family‚Äôs Miami golf resort four times
The financial market meltdown was underway when President Trump boarded Air Force One on his way to Florida on Thursday for a doubleheader of sorts: a Saudi-backed golf tournament at his family‚Äôs Miami resort and a weekend of fund-raisers attracting hundreds of donors to his Palm Beach club.

It was a fresh reminder that in his second term, Mr. Trump has continued to find ways to drive business to his family-owned real-estate ventures, a practice he has sustained even when his work in Washington has caused worldwide financial turmoil.

The Trump family monetization weekend started Thursday night, as crowds began to form at both the Trump National Doral resort near Miami International Airport, and separately at his Mar-a-Lago resort 70 miles up the coast.

Mr. Trump landed on the edge of one of the golf courses in a military helicopter ‚Äî just in time for a dinner at Doral. The next day, LIV Golf, the breakaway professional league backed by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs sovereign wealth fund, was scheduled to hold a tournament at the course for the fourth time.

On Thursday at Mar-a-Lago, hundreds of guests gathered for the American Patriots Gala, a conservative fund-raiser that featured Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and President Javier Milei of Argentina, who told his supporters back home that he was hoping to catch up with Mr. Trump while there, seemingly unaware that Mr. Trump was double-booked at two of his family properties that night.

And that was just the weekend‚Äôs lead-up.

Mr. Trump ordered a new set of global tariffs on Wednesday from the White House using his trademark Sharpie pen, a version of which is on sale at Mar-a-Lago for $3.

The announcement set off one of the largest market crashes in American history, erasing $5 trillion in market value from companies in the S&P 500 in just two days. Mr. Trump has said his policy would reverse what he calls unfair trade practices, and that eventually the ‚Äúmarkets are going to boom.‚Äù

On Friday, as markets continued to tumble, thousands of golf fans visited Doral, as did Eric Trump, Mr. Trump‚Äôs son, and Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs $925 billion sovereign wealth fund. Mr. Al-Rumayyan is also the chairman of LIV Golf, and was there to see its stars compete.

‚ÄúIt is a nice club,‚Äù Mr. Al-Rumayyan said as he walked around the golf course watching the players tee off.

LIV Golf ‚Äî a venture intended to lift the Saudi profile worldwide even as it has burned through hundreds of millions of dollars of state funds ‚Äî is styled as a daylong party, with club music pumping out of speakers lining tournament courses and machines dispensing wine and large beers. On Friday, fans watched a bit of golf and danced on the edges of the course. Others in MAGA hats walked around smoking cigars.

In short, the economic turbulence seemed far away.

‚ÄúYou are all looking a little too stiff!‚Äù said Matt Rogers, a LIV Golf announcer, as he yelled into a microphone, blasting his message across the greens as the first group of golfers on Friday prepared to play with dance music blaring in the background. ‚ÄúYou need to turn this up! This is LIV Golf.‚Äù

Every room at the 643-room Trump Doral, including the $13,000-a-night presidential suite, was sold out through the weekend. Not a seat could be found at the BLT Prime steakhouse bar, where a porterhouse steak cost $130.

‚ÄúThis is the perfect venue,‚Äù Eric Trump said as he strolled the golf course Friday.

He had driven his father in a golf cart from the military helicopter to the resort dinner the day before, as the festivities over the big moneymaking weekend were getting underway.
The president spent much of Friday at yet another Trump family venue, Trump International Golf Club, not far from Mar-a-Lago, sending out social media messages during the day, including, ‚ÄúTHIS IS A GREAT TIME TO GET RICH, RICHER THAN EVER BEFORE.‚Äù

By Friday night, the center of attention had shifted back to Mar-a-Lago, as Mr. Trump held another in a series of $1 million-a-head dinners at his private club in Palm Beach.

Since he was elected in November, Mr. Trump has hosted at least four of the fund-raisers, including one in December, two in March and the one Friday night, with a fifth planned for April 24.

The fund-raisers unfold in similar ways, according to people who have attended them.

Roughly 20 people gather around a candlelit table with big white flowers in the club‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhite and Gold Room‚Äù after a photo session. Mr. Trump speaks, then listens to the guests discuss their businesses, one by one. In just an hour or two, he can raise as much as $20 million ‚Äî a great return on his time investment, associates say.
Attendees at some of the post-election dinners at Mar-a-Lago hosted by MAGA Inc., one of Mr. Trump‚Äôs fund-raising political action committees, have included the casino owner Miriam Adelson, the sugar magnate Pepe Fanjul and James Taiclet, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, the world‚Äôs largest military contractor, along with representatives from the cryptocurrency and energy industries.

On Friday, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir, and Steve Wynn, the former casino executive, both billionaires, were among the guests at the Mar-a-Lago fund-raiser, according to two people briefed on the matter. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the event.

The dinners have been just the start. Mar-a-Lago remains a popular site for Republican candidates to host their own fund-raisers, Federal Election Commission records show.It is not clear to some Republicans why Mr. Trump has been raising money so aggressively, according to eight people involved in conservative fund-raising who have kept track of his Mr. Trump‚Äôs efforts. Never before has a president ineligible for re-election vacuumed up so much money for a super PAC.

Some of Mr. Trump‚Äôs associates believe it is prudent to fund-raise when the money is available, as corporate interests and others seek to get access to the president or make amends for perceived slights, people close to him acknowledge.

The packed agendas at the two Trump venues recalled the constant buzz and spending by lobbyists, members of Congress and foreign leaders at Trump International Hotel in Washington before the Trump family sold its lease after Mr. Trump‚Äôs first term.

In addition to the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, top sponsors of the Doral golf tournament included Aramco, the Saudi oil company; Riyadh Air, the airline owned by the sovereign wealth fund; and TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media company whose fate Mr. Trump is helping to decide, according to a large billboard outside one of the event‚Äôs party tents.

Mr. Trump‚Äôs merchandise shops ‚Äî there are at least three of them at Doral ‚Äî were also doing swift business, selling everything from a $550 Trump-branded crystal-studded purse to $18 Doral-branded paperweights made in China. The store clerk said that he did not know if new tariffs on imported products would mean price increases.

Fans in the crowd said that they had traveled from as far as South Africa to attend the event. Some purchased special tickets that cost as much as $1,400 to enter exclusive party areas with free drinks and food ‚Äî tickets that were sold out as of Saturday.

In interviews, tournament attendees and others said that they did not mind the disconnect between the Wall Street meltdown and the events at the Trump properties.
‚ÄúThe sky is falling every day,‚Äù said Mike Atwell, a Key Largo, Fla., restaurant owner who was attending the LIV event with his wife enjoying lunch and drinks. ‚ÄúWhen you are happy, you drink. When you are sad, you drink. It all works out.‚Äù

Tyrell Davis, a 39-year-old entrepreneur spending Saturday afternoon in Palm Beach, said that he admired Mr. Trump for focusing on his own businesses while also implementing tariffs that he believed would benefit Americans.

Mr. Davis said that the United States had given away money to other countries for years while not investing in American cities, and that it only made sense Mr. Trump would continue to bolster his own businesses while in office.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all about business and money,‚Äù Mr. Davis said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what it‚Äôs all about. America is a business. It‚Äôs a corporation.‚Äù

On Saturday, as the tournament continued at Doral, Mr. Trump showed up at yet another family golf course, in Jupiter, Fla., which is holding its own, more modest tournament.
Good news was announced by the White House staff: ‚ÄúThe president won his second round matchup of the senior club championship today in Jupiter, Fla., and advances to the championship round on Sunday.‚Äù Reporters and photographers were prohibited from watching him play, and were held down the street at a coffee shop.

As Mr. Trump returned to Mar-a-Lago, one of his political committees sent out an offer to his followers: They could buy a signed replica of his executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. The minimum contribution was $50. ‚ÄúI want you to have a PIECE OF HISTORY in your home,‚Äù Mr. Trump said in the solicitation.

I will be visiting Tobe Zoo in May and I saw the zipline activity and would love to try it, so I was wondering how I would get back to Tobe Zoo after ending up at the Children's Park? Is it possible to also do a zipline back to the zoo if I would like?

Lastly, it seems like the only option to eat around Tobe Zoo is the Sky Garden Restaurant, any other nearby suggestions for food or coffee please?

The dreadful feeling of being in a foreign country and attempting to pay for a meal but your card declining. I‚Äôm not a traveler by any means (literally avoid foreign travel at all costs) but recently I found myself in England for travels - something came up so I had to go. 

Oh boy using my CCs was mostly a disaster, I extra prepared and brought 3 cards and at various times I was stuck playing musical chairs with my cards for every purchase until one of them worked. The cards I carried were a mix of FTF and no FTF, not sure if this matters.

I kept getting those ‚Äúwe detected possible fraud, press C to confirm blah blah‚Äù text messages and I responded everytime. But my friends, their cards worked seemingly without hassle for every purchase. 

What are your tricks to ensure your cards don‚Äôt keep declining when abroad? I was thinking: to login to my account upon landing so the algo detects that I‚Äôm abroad & make a small purchase at the airport (coffee, water, etc) so the algo detects I‚Äôm abroad. Could it be since I never travel abroad I‚Äôm out of luck? Besides that I don‚Äôt know so I‚Äôm all ears! Thank you. 

Edit: I‚Äôm American and the cards were from TD bank and WF. Both don‚Äôt require travel notices. ",0,1743951233.0,CreditCards,10,0.29,False

1jsvwaa,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1jsvwaa/why_local_seo_services_are_essential_for_your/,Why Local SEO Services Are Essential for Your Business Growth,"In today‚Äôs highly competitive digital landscape, businesses need to make a strong online presence to attract local customers. While global visibility is important, focusing on local SEO can significantly boost your chances of standing out in your community. Local SEO services are tailored strategies designed to improve your business's visibility in search engine results when potential customers are looking for products or services near them. If you're not already utilizing local SEO, you may be missing out on a large segment of customers who are actively searching for what you offer. Let's explore why local SEO services are essential for your business growth.

# 1. Targeted Audience Reach

Local SEO helps your business reach customers in your specific geographical area. Unlike global SEO, which targets a broader audience, local SEO focuses on driving traffic from local search results. This means your business is more likely to appear in searches made by people in your area who are genuinely interested in your products or services. Whether you're a local bakery, a plumbing service, or a fitness center, optimizing for local searches ensures you capture the attention of those nearby.

# 2. Higher Conversion Rates

One of the primary benefits of local SEO is the potential for higher conversion rates. People who search for local businesses are often ready to make a purchase or inquiry. For example, if someone types ""best coffee shop near me"" into Google, they are likely to visit the coffee shop soon after finding it. When your business ranks well in local search results, you are putting yourself in front of people who are actively looking to spend money. This targeted exposure leads to higher conversion rates compared to a broader, less focused approach.

# 3. Increased Local Visibility

Local SEO services help improve your visibility within your community. Search engines like Google prioritize local businesses when users search for products or services in specific areas. This is especially evident in features like Google‚Äôs ""Local Pack"" ‚Äî the map with a list of businesses that shows up at the top of search results. By optimizing your website and online presence for local SEO, you increase your chances of appearing in this Local Pack, which significantly improves your chances of attracting foot traffic to your business.

# 4. Better User Experience

Optimizing for local SEO is not only beneficial for search engines, but it also provides a better experience for users. Local SEO ensures that potential customers find accurate and relevant information, such as your business hours, location, and phone number, all in one place. This makes it easier for customers to make decisions quickly and reduces the frustration that comes with finding information about your business online. When people can easily locate your contact details and learn about your offerings, it creates trust and encourages them to visit or contact you directly.

# 5. Competitive Advantage

Many businesses still overlook the importance of local SEO, which creates a significant opportunity for those who implement it effectively. By investing in local SEO services, you give your business a competitive advantage over competitors who aren't yet optimizing for local searches. Even if you're in an industry with a lot of competition, local SEO can help your business stand out by targeting highly relevant, nearby customers who are looking for what you offer.

# 6. Long-Term Results

Another key advantage of local SEO is that it provides long-term results. Once your business starts ranking well in local searches, it can continue to benefit from that visibility for months or even years. Unlike paid advertising campaigns, which require constant investment, local SEO is a cost-effective strategy that can deliver long-lasting organic traffic. This means you get consistent exposure without having to continuously pay for ads.

# Conclusion

Incorporating local SEO strategies into your digital marketing plan is one of the most effective ways to grow your business. It helps attract more customers from your local area, boosts conversion rates, and enhances your overall online visibility. Whether you're a small business or a larger company, investing in local SEO services can provide a significant return on investment by ensuring that your business is seen by the people who matter most ‚Äî your local customers. Don't miss out on this valuable opportunity to drive more targeted traffic to your business.",1,1743951161.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False
1jsvu9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cruise/comments/1jsvu9z/dcl_fan_sails_on_royal_caribbean_for_the_first/,DCL fan sails on Royal Caribbean for the first time,"I am, admittedly, a fan of Disney Cruise Line. I've completed, I think, 14 cruises with DCL (covering all of their current ships except the Treasure). Recently, my family (myself, wife, and 2 kids) went on an 8 night sailing on Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas, along with some family members (2A, 3C). Here are my thoughts on how the lines compare:

**Ship first impressions:**  
Walking into RCCL, there's no grand atrium, instead you're right in the middle of all the shops. 1 shop with RC merch, the rest are fancy jewelry and watches and art. The pizza restaurant is there, and a small cafe, and 2 bars. Also, for some reason, 2 Starbucks within a hundred yards of each other. *Edge: Disney*

**Rest of the ship:**¬†  
There's a lot of stuff to do on Oasis. There's an outdoor park with some benches (and more jewelry stores, and a bar) that was pretty nice, there's a boardwalk area with a (free!) carousel, there's a multi purpose area that is sometimes an ice rink, 4 or 5 pools and hot tubs, a casino (didn't partake), a giant dry slide, a zip line, flow rider surf simulators, a rock climbing wall, and more. *Edge: Royal (although no dedicated movie theater and no poolside movies, which both lose points)*¬†

**Pools:**¬†  
The pool deck had 3 pools, plus a good sized splash area for kids who are out of diapers, and a much smaller splash pad for the diaper crowd. I think there were 3 hot tubs. Plus there was a pool and hot tub in the adult only area. The pools were never super crowded (at least when we were there), and the water was a reasonable temperature. The pool towel policy (you have to sign out your towels, and you will be charged if you don't return them to the attendant) is absurd.. *Edge: Disney, because of the towel policy. The actual pools were pretty even*

**Rooms:**¬†  
Smaller and with less storage space than on Disney. Only 1 single electrical outlet near the bed (and 3 near the vanity), no USB charging ports. I missed the split bathroom. Shower was tiny. Had a dispenser for ""body wash and shampoo in one"". No conditioner. *Edge: Disney*

**Stateroom cleanliness/maintenance:**¬†  
The bathroom always had a bit of a smell, but everything looked pretty clean. We had to call maintenance for a broken drawer, leaky shower head, and the balcony door wouldn't stop whistling. All were fixed, but I feel like the stateroom host should have noticed these things and called them in for us. Only 1 service per day (no turndown). Sink in the bathroom wouldn't get hot or cold, it was always just about warm. Shower temp and pressure were good. *Edge: Disney*

**Ship cleanliness:**¬†  
Never noticed any dirty restrooms or anything. There seemed to be fewer public restrooms than on Disney ships. Didn't see as much constant cleaning (interior and exterior) as DCL. Also didn't see the constant pool deck squeegeeing that we see on DCL. *Edge: Disney, but not really by much.*¬†

**Other Guests cleanliness:**¬†  
Like Disney, the buffet had hand washing sinks at the entrance and a crew member watching to make sure you wash. Unlike Disney, no hand wipes as you enter the dining rooms. There were sanitizer dispensers, but you weren't forced to use them, and half the time I tried, they were empty. *Edge: Disney*

**Main dining rooms:**¬†  
Oasis had 3, all right above each other, but you would always go to the same one (well, on the first night they took us up to the 5th floor because the first floor was slammed, but this was unusual). Some people had set dining times, we had the ""my time"" dining which was flexible. But since we were traveling with family, we made a reservation for the same time each night, all together. On the nights we showed up at our reserved time, we had the same table and servers. The other nights we didn't. Our assigned servers were pretty good, 1 of the others was mediocre and 1 of the others was bad. Food quality was pretty good. DCL has more ""upscale"" things included - RCCL had a NY strip steak for free every night, but filet was an upcharge, whereas DCL has a few different types of steaks on different nights, plus the NY strip. (Admittedly, NY strip is not my favorite cut, so I didn't order it, but family members said it was good)

*Food quality edge: Even*  
*Food variety edge: Disney*  
*Service edge: Even*¬†

**Buffet:**¬†  
The buffet on Oasis was called Windjammers, and it was in the same basic area - top rear of the ship. I feel like Cabanas/Marceline on DCL has more variety of the ‚Äúrotational items‚Äù, while keeping the staples all the time. Food was pretty decent, and the French fries were better than Disney, but I would've enjoyed a little more variety, even if it's just ""sour cream and chive mashed potatoes vs plain mashed potatoes"". Windjammers did feel like it had more seating available, we never had to go around more than once to find a table. *Edge: Disney, slightly*¬†

**Other free food options:**¬†  
There was a pizza place on deck 5 that was open until 3am every day. Pizza was not great but better than Disney. There were a few small cafe type restaurants with premade sandwiches, these usually closed at 530. On the pool deck, there was a taco quick service, also closed at 530 daily. The hot dog place on the boardwalk also closed at 6. Royal gets some points for being able to get pizza later, and the buffet served dinner (including burgers and hot dogs and chicken strips), so overall you could pretty much get all the food that you can on Disney, but I didn't like that the places closed so early. *Edge: Disney*

**Upcharge dining options:**  
There are a ton of them - Italian, steakhouse, hibachi, BBQ, French cuisine, and Johnny Rockets. (For JR, breakfast is free, other meals are $15 each, which includes entree, side, drink, and possibly dessert. They also have milkshakes, which you can purchase a la carte, or they're included with some of the beverage packages). We only ate at the steakhouse, and we put the kids in the club, so we could enjoy an adult meal. We prepaid before we got on the ship, and it was $35/person. If we hadn't prepaid, it would have been $65 each. (They also offer multi night premium dining packages). The food was really good, the service was not. There was only 1 host, who was checking everyone in, showing everyone to their table, making reservations, and clearing tables. We waited about 15 minutes to be seated, with only 2 parties ahead of us, and everyone's table was ready. Then we waited another 10 minutes for the waiter to take our drink orders. Pacing of the meal was inconsistent - there was a gap between appetizers and mains, but no gap before dessert. I was expecting service on par with a Ruth's Chris, or Capitol Grille, or yes, Palo. Instead, we got service that was a step up from Outback, but not much. I would have been very disappointed if we had paid full price, but as it was, the food justified what we paid. *Edge: Disney*

**Soda:**  
Soda is not included on Royal. You can buy one of 3 beverage packages that will get you soda - the ""classic soda"" package, the ""refreshment"" package, it the ""premium beverage"" package. The classic gets you just soda, refreshment adds Johnny Rockets milkshakes, cocktails, bottled water, Powerade and non Starbucks coffee, and the premium included alcoholic drinks. I had the refreshment package and probably could have gone with just the classic soda package, but the milkshakes were pretty good, and getting a bottled Powerade once in a while was nice. You also get a refillable cup to get soda from 3 Coke freestyle machines (one near the pizza place, one in the buffet, and one near the taco place on the pool deck) and you can order soda in bars and the main dining rooms. I'm not a big fan of the freestyle machines - Coke Zero is my poison of choice, and it is always awful from those machines. Diet Coke is my second choice and is tolerable from the freestyle machines, so that's what I drank all week. *Edge: Disney*

**Kids clubs:**¬†  
Both lines offer youth programming for all ages from 6 months up to 18. The nursery is an added cost but all the other ages are not. The nursery on Oasis is cheaper than the DCL nurseries, but both of them were pretty good and 2 y/o daughter enjoyed it. For bigger kids (4 y/o son's age), DCL has both the Oceaneer club and Oceaneer lab, which are both pretty big areas, and kids can usually move between the 2. RCCL has one small room for kids 3-6. They did a lot of arts and crafts activities, but I think he got bored sometimes because there wasn't as much space and not as much to do. *Edge: Disney*

**Shows:**  
Disney has really great shoes, we all know this, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the shows we saw on Oasis. Aqua 80 was a water show with an 80s music soundtrack. Frozen in Time was a figure skating show based on Hans Christian Andersen stories (although there was no dialogue or singing). We also saw Cats, which remains my all time least favorite musical that I've ever seen. The actors were talented, but you really can't do much with a show that has zero plot. *Edge: pretty even*

**Private Island:**¬†  
We went to Coco Cay, and it was pretty nice. We pretty much only did the splash pad, but it was a pretty big area - some zero depth water features, and some small water slides (2 y/o daughter could go with an adult, 4 y/o son could go by himself) that dump you out into a 2 foot deep pool. Son did the slides for probably 45 minutes or an hour. He just kept getting off and getting right back in line, he loved it. Our family said the beach party was nice but the water was cold (End of March, not surprising). We were one of 2 ships there that day, the other was the Independence of the Seas, which is smaller than Oasis, but still larger capacity than anything currently in Disney's fleet. Because we never made it past the splash pad, I don't know how crowded the other areas felt. Lunch was pretty much the same as at castaway - grilled food, but there was also a taco station that doesn't exist on castaway. *Edge: Royal, for what we saw.*

**Activities and musicians:**  
We only did one music trivia, just because of the way schedules worked out. It was a Disney music trivia, and we came in 3rd place. The event host was fine, maybe not quite as personable as some of the Disney hosts, but not bad. We saw a few musicians (guitarist, reggae band, jazz quartet) and they were all pretty good. There were some others on board that we didn't get to see, like the pianist and the guitar/vocal duo. We saw the musicians outside in the park area, but they also had some sets in various bars around the ship. The ship also had a music hall, but we didn't see anything there. (Oddly, the music hall has a digital sign showing upcoming events ... at other venues on the ship, but not what's coming up in that venue. I think DCL does better with that, every venue has a sign showing that days events) *Edge: Disney for the signage issue, but overall pretty even for the performers*¬†

**Shopping:**  
Oasis had one store dedicated to RCCL merch and one small ""beachwear"" store. Everything else was upscale brands. Hublot, Breitling, Kate Spade, Michael Kors, Effy. They also had a few vending machines that sold toiletries, sunscreen and a few OTC meds - think Tylenol, Advil, Pepto type stuff. Nowhere to get extra diapers or wipes if you run low. *Edge: Disney*

**Pricing:**  
Royal Caribbean IS cheaper than Disney, but I didn't find the price differences to be the ""you can do 2 cruises on RCCL for the cost of 1 comparable DCL cruise"" level of difference that is sometimes mentioned on this subreddit. RCCL frequently does promos such as ""Kids sail free"" or ""2nd adult 50% off"", and Disney doesn't often run those type of promos. I don't remember exactly what promos were offered when we booked this cruise, but I know some were applied.

**Overall thoughts:**  
We enjoyed ourselves, and if we are going with friends or family, we would do RCCL again (although possibly booking 2 cabins to have more space, even though we're only a family of 4). However, at least for the next few years, until the kids are big enough to do more of the things, if it's just us, we will stick to DCL.",3,1743951012.0,Cruise,4,0.8,False

# 32 oz Hydro Flask Straw Lid Showdown (2025): Best Options & Alternatives Compared!

Staying hydrated is crucial, whether you're hitting the trails, crushing a workout, or simply navigating a busy day. And for many, the 32 oz Hydro Flask is the trusty sidekick that makes it all possible. But let's face it, the lid situation can make or break the entire experience.While the standard cap is great, many crave the convenience and practicality of a straw lid.

This comprehensive guide dives deep into the world of the 32 oz hydro flask straw lid. We‚Äôll explore the best options available in 2025,weigh the pros and cons of different designs,and even unveil some fantastic alternatives you might not have considered. Whether you're a seasoned Hydro Flask aficionado looking for a hydro flask straw lid replacement,or a newbie wanting too upgrade your hydration game,this is for you.## Why Choose a Straw Lid for Your 32 oz Hydro Flask?

Before we get into the nitty-gritty of specific products, let's address the elephant in the room: why choose a straw lid in the first place? The appeal is undeniable.

   **Effortless Hydration:** A straw lid makes it incredibly easy to take a sip without tilting the entire bottle. This is a game-changer during workouts,commutes,or any situation where you need quick and convenient access to water.
   **Reduced Spills:** While not all straw lids are created equal (more on that later!),a good design can significantly reduce the risk of spills,especially for kids.   **Temperature Regulation:** Minimizing the amount of time the bottle is open helps maintain the temperature of your drink for longer.
   **Style and Personalization:** Let's be honest, a cool straw lid can elevate the overall aesthetic of your Hydro Flask. With various colors and designs available, you can personalize your bottle to match your style.
   **Improved Posture:** For some, consistently tilting a large water bottle back can cause neck strain over time.Using a straw lid eliminates this need, promoting better posture.

## Understanding Your Needs: Key Considerations Before Buying a 32 oz Hydro Flask Straw Lid

Not all 32 oz hydro flask straw lids are created equal. To make the best choice, it's crucial to consider your specific needs and priorities.

   **Leak-Proof Design:** This is arguably the most crucial factor, especially for parents and those who carry their hydro flask in a bag. Look for lids that are specifically advertised as ‚Äúhydro flask straw lid leak proof.‚Äù Read reviews carefully to get real-world insights.
   **Compatibility:** Ensure the lid is compatible with your specific 32 oz Hydro Flask. Most are designed for wide-mouth bottles,but it's always best to double-check. Pay close attention to whether it fits the standard Hydro Flask wide mouth 32 oz.
   **durability:** A flimsy lid won't last long. Look for materials that can withstand daily wear and tear. Also consider the availability of replacement straws.
   **Ease of Cleaning:** A complex design with hard-to-reach crevices can become a breeding ground for bacteria. Opt for a lid that's easy to disassemble and clean, preferably dishwasher-safe. A hydro flask straw lid with cleaning brush included is a bonus!
   **Material:** Make sure the lid is BPA-free and made from food-grade materials. This is especially important for kids. Look for ""hydro flask straw lid BPA free"" in the features.   **price:** Hydro Flask straw lid 32 oz price can vary widely depending on the brand and features.Set a budget and stick to it. Keep an eye out for a hydro flask straw lid sale!
   **Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, you also want a lid that looks good! Consider the color, finish, and overall design.

   **Leaking:** Ensure the straw is properly inserted and securely attached to the lid. Check the silicone seals for damage or wear. Consider replacing the seals if necessary. Ensure the lid is screwed on tightly but not over-tightened.
   **Restricted flow:** Clean the straw and valve thoroughly. Use the included cleaning brush or a small pipe cleaner to remove any blockages.
   **Strange Taste or Odor:** This is usually due to bacteria buildup. Disassemble the lid and soak all parts in a solution of warm water and baking soda. Rinse thoroughly before reassembling.

I was at a tough school and one day we had to get inprocessed by the Battalion CO and CSM. Morning was ASU/AGSU and afternoon was ACU. Went to lunch, changed, made some coffee and went back. 

During lunch I ate a great Soldier lunch of Girl Scout thin mints I had in the freezer. Then was sipping on coffee while the CO was talking. Suddenly my stomach was rumbling (not from hunger, but from a demon trying to crawl its way upward) and I tried my hardest to just swallow it down. I got up, found a DS in the room and told them I need to use the latrine cause I think I‚Äôm gonna throw up. Walk down the hall and push my way in. 

As I entered the latrine, I started to lose the battle. I rounded the little wall that was there and suddenly the demon escaped. I sent vomit shooting from my face hole all over the floor. None of it was solidified, it was pure liquid. It covered the ENTIRE floor. I finished what I could in the toilet and instantly panicked upon leaving the stall. My god, I was fucked. 

I found a role of skill craft toilet paper (the best and finest for such an occasion) and started wiping it up. I used the whole roll and there was no end in sight. I promptly looked around, threw what I could away and went back to the CO talking so it didn‚Äôt look like I was a piece of shit. Vomit still all over the bathroom. 

I came by a little later to a DS checking in there and screaming at privates to go clean that shit up. They were the saddest looking troops I‚Äôve ever seen. It was never brought up again. Until now. Let me hear some of your embarrassing stories while you‚Äôve been in so I don‚Äôt feel like a monster. ",29,1743950947.0,army,5,0.89,False

I have been a heavy caffeine user for always although only started to get some awareness around it in the last 10 years.  have had 3 decent quits (6-9 months) but hung onto the chocolate.  So haven't actually quit all caffeine, ever, I guess.  Thinking that Ill do ust that this time (ie no choc) as last time it was choc that got me hooked again.  Plus I now know about cacoa and moderating that shit goes about as well as moderating any caffeinated drink for me (not very).

Im not going to write a misery-log - but it is bad.  I know how much many people consume - but i take insane quantities by anyone's measure.  All i can think about is caffeine and when Im going to quit, and increasingly IF I can quit.   It's got scary for me now.  I can sense the effect on my body and mind so acutely.  Literally driving my partner crazy, in tandem to the pretty good job im doing on myself..

Anyhow, I really do want to get off it and see whats after this hell - but mostly I just HAVE to get off it as I cant live many more days in this state.  It's unbearable.  And this state is always where I end up.  I cant moderate, its full on addiction and my life is plainly not manageable like this.

Tried tapering and subbing with caff pills - but i cant stick to a plan for more than 2 days and the pills are just dangerous for me.  Next best thing i found was eating coffee which sort of helps as the ritual etc is removed - and it's hard to be in denial of your addiction when you're eating coffee at 6am.

I dont even know what im scared of in quitting again; im so fed up with this shit so what the fuck is there to loose?

Here's my problem, that manifested EXTREMELY dangerously today on the road. I have a licence for a couple of months now, I enjoy driving (although it's extremely stressful for me), but I still have some problems like turning at the last possible second (even after the last possible second, that's how I blew up a tire on the way to fix a leak in the steering wheel) and not paying attention to the road while looking at it - I just don't register what I see sometimes. I do MY BEST literary I put all my resources to paying attention and I still miss somethings, which is life threatening. Today I had to swich lanes, from the left to the right in order to do a right turn later. So, I was constantly looking for an opening to the right. At the same time I was king of keeping an eye on the road, but probably not enough, because I WAS TURNING LEFT RIGHT INTO THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC IN THE OTHER DIRECTION! AND I DID THIS TWICE!! My husband was on the passenger seat and if he hadn't alerted me, I WOULD HAVE NEVER REALIZED THAT I'M CROSSING THE DOUBLE LINE AND TRYING TO DRIVE IN THE ONCOMING TRAFFIC, while looking for an opening. I have an idea what's the problem - I tend to fixate my attention on something. I try to remedy it by playing a game, while waiting on the red lights (you need to see the change immediately, but also to look at the light, which makes me fixate my attention on one thing - once I enter the fixed-on-one-thing attention mode, there is almost no turning back) - I try to count all the red/green/silver/black cars that are passing by. I try to always drive well rested and at most an hour after I've had a coffee (it really helps me concentrate). The trick and the coffee help, but they do not solve the problem. Right now I feel extremely ashamed of myself and at a total loss - I truly do not know how I can help myself with this. I tend to find solutions for most of my problems like forgetting the time  to get ready to leave (I have one long timer an I set shorter timers for the particular task I'm doing), I have a playlist of music and some podcasts ready to encourage me to do things instead of brainrot, etc. As long as I see the problem, I fix it.

Here‚Äôs what I remember:

\-  The menu had this old computer with a glowing blue on the screen.

\-  The game takes place in an office setting. 

\-  You had to do little tasks like folding origami such as fish, swans, stuff like that. There were instructions for how to fold them.

\-  There was also a coffee machine somewhere I think next to papers? there was paperclips.

\-  One part I remember clearly: a woman was crying because her goldfish died (I think??), and you had to fold an origami fish and give it to her, and she felt better after that.

\-  You could walk around the office, and each employee had a little desk space with dividers.

\-  There were multiple rooms you could explore, but they requires a key.

\-  I‚Äôm pretty sure it was a 3D game, probably made in Unity by Indie devs.

Appreciate if you give me some advice.

1. The Black Ice of Greenland

""Run! Don‚Äôt look back!""

My mother yanked me down the steel corridors of Pituffik Space Base. Behind us, automated gunfire ripped through the air. My father‚Äôs body lay just outside the lab door.

The shouts of U.S. soldiers were closing in. My mother came to a sudden stop and tore open her protective suit. Two grenades were strapped to her chest.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no time...‚Äù Her face was pale as death. She pulled out a tactical knife, pressed her left hand against the wall‚Äîand slashed.

Snap!

Her pinky finger landed in my palm. No blood, just a writhing black-gold liquid at the severed edge. It slithered like a living thing, curling around my fingers.

‚ÄúTake it. Bury it. Never let the Americans get their hands on it.‚Äù She shoved me into the emergency exit and turned back.

The last thing I saw was her charging into the enemy line, grenades primed.

Then‚Äîeverything was fire.

2.

The truck bounced violently across the snowfields. The diesel engine‚Äôs roar was the only sound.

I huddled in the seat, clutching my mother‚Äôs severed finger. It had stopped moving, now just a lump of black-gold amber embedded in my skin.

Outside, the storm howled. Frost bloomed across the window, blurring the jagged outline of distant mountains.

‚ÄúRun. Get off Greenland...‚Äù

My mother‚Äôs voice still echoed in my mind. But where was I supposed to go?

This morning, I was just another kid thinking about the video game release this month, annoyed by a social studies assignment on how U.S. elections affect Greenland.

Now‚ÄîI was an orphan.

I pressed the finger fragment to my chest, pretending it still carried her warmth.

Suddenly, a sharp sting in my chest. The blackened fingertip fused to my skin, releasing a burnt asphalt stench. It crawled into my chest like a leech, inch by inch.

I ripped off my coat, but it was gone‚Äîonly a black mark remained, no larger than a fingertip, smoldering like scorched tar.

‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?!‚Äù

I dug at it with my nails‚Äîand the moment I touched it‚Äî

Buzz!

A vision flashed before my eyes: my mother standing in front of a frozen cave in Dickson Fjord, her hand reaching toward a vein of black-gold ore...

Then it vanished.

I gasped for air, heart hammering.

Was it... showing me her memories?

3.

If I could access my mother's memories again, maybe I‚Äôd finally learn why the U.S. military killed them‚Äîand what this black substance really was.

I shut my eyes and pressed the black mark on my chest.

Instantly, I was pulled back to September 2023.

Dickson Fjord, Eastern Greenland

A strange seismic wave had been detected near the fjord, so my parents went to investigate. Dickson Fjord was a maze of icy cliffs and glacier walls. Deep inside a newly exposed cavern‚Äîunmarked on any map‚Äîthey found it.

The quake had reshaped the terrain, revealing a prehistoric cave sealed for millions of years.

At the cave‚Äôs heart, a pulsing black ore veined the walls. It looked like frozen tar, but something flowed beneath its surface.

‚ÄúThat quake‚Äîit came from this thing,‚Äù my father whispered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs... breathing.‚Äù

My mother, gloved and cautious, reached out to touch it‚Äî

Shhhk!

The black-gold liquefied instantly, crawling up her hand like oil. She yanked it back, but it was too late‚Äîa sliver had lodged itself in her pinky.

Three days later, the lab‚Äôs test mice chewed through steel cages and escaped, only to die from massive internal bleeding‚Äîovereating themselves to death.

‚ÄúIt makes organisms stronger‚Ä¶ but it also amplifies desire,‚Äù my father muttered, pale as a ghost.

My mother stared at her finger. The black substance squirmed beneath her skin like a parasite.

‚ÄúWe have to keep this secret.‚Äù

4.

The truck finally stopped.

Uummannaq‚Äîmy childhood fishing village‚Äîlay ahead.

Tiny wooden houses, frozen boats, cod drying in the wind. Nothing had changed. But my world was shattered.

I stumbled home. The spare key was still hidden above the doorframe. Inside, dust floated in sunbeams. My father‚Äôs computer hummed in standby. My mother‚Äôs coffee mug sat upside down in the cabinet, as if they‚Äôd just stepped out for a walk.

‚ÄúCalm down. First, survive.‚Äù

I found the first-aid kit and scrubbed at the black mark on my chest with alcohol. It didn‚Äôt fade. It was like a birthmark‚Äîdeep, immovable.

‚ÄúGoddammit!‚Äù I grabbed a fork and stabbed at it. The tines sank into my chest‚Äîfour neat, one-centimeter holes.

No pain. No blood.

Beneath the skin, black-gold veins flashed‚Äîthen the wounds sealed themselves instantly.

‚ÄúWhat... are you?‚Äù

My father‚Äôs computer lit up. Blue light flickered across my face.

A pre-recorded video played.

‚ÄúKid‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre seeing this, it means we didn‚Äôt make it back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have much time to explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúTwo years ago, in a cave at Dickson Fjord, we discovered something we called ‚ÄòBlack Ice.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúIn small doses, it bonds with living tissue and accelerates healing.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can even reshape itself in response to brainwave patterns.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut in large amounts, it emits a neurotoxin‚Äîone that inflames desire and eventually drives the host insane.‚Äù

‚ÄúI kept it secret‚Ä¶ fearing what the military would do.‚Äù

The video froze.

Offscreen: pounding on a door. My mother rushed past, hiding a vial of black ice in the bedroom safe.

Then the screen went dark. A voice, calm and American, spoke in the background:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here under orders from President Trump.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre coming with us.‚Äù

‚ÄúBring the child.‚Äù

5.

I sprinted to the bedroom, cracked open the safe with my birthday code.

Inside:

* A syringe filled with boiling black-gold.
* My father‚Äôs research journal.
* A hand-marked map of Dickson Fjord, veins of black ice circled in red.

The last page was my mother‚Äôs handwriting:

‚ÄúThe risks of Black Ice are too great. It doesn‚Äôt belong to anyone.‚Äù

Dogs barked outside. Then‚Äîthe crunch of boots on snow.

They were here.

Radios crackled. I heard them outside the house.

‚ÄúTarget confirmed inside. Prepare to breach.‚Äù

I slammed the safe shut‚Äî

BOOM!

The doorframe exploded. Splinters flew. Three armed U.S. soldiers stormed in, rifles aimed.

Laser sights locked on my chest.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt move! Hands up!‚Äù

The lead officer‚Äôs eyes darted to the syringe in my hand. His pupils shrank.

‚ÄúPut it down, kid,‚Äù he said, slowly raising his weapon. ‚ÄúUnless you want to end up like your‚Äî‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt wait for him to finish.

As the trigger clicked, I rammed the syringe into my neck.

If Black Ice really responded to brainwaves, then right now, I was thinking one thing:

Kill them all.

Time shattered.

I could see the bullet spiraling from the barrel.

Hear the unspoken curse in the officer‚Äôs throat.

Count the floating splinters in midair.

And then‚Äî

Agony erupted.

I silently plead with my dog not to shake herself so that her tags won't ring and escalate the meltdown that way.

I hope I've been careful enough about morning food that I don't need to use our one bathroom; it's inaccessible until she's back in her bedroom. I have a commode if I'm desperate, but I desperately hate cleaning the thing when I finally can get to the bathroom.

And she might just come up with something she needs me to do during her meltdown. To be honest, that's not the worst part: the worst part is deciding if she wants me to help her with something or not. If I ask, ""Do you need me to do something?"" and she doesn't, *that* escalates the meltdown. I am supposed to be taking care of her, however, so if she needs me, I should be there.

When she's done with her first meltdown, I am done for the day. Exhausted. Depressed. Oh, I'll get all the things that absolutely have to be done finished, but I'll pretty much just wait for the end of her second meltdown, after which I am allowed to go to bed and hope there won't be a third one overnight. There isn't any progress. We're trapped here, like this, forever.

And when my sister expresses this sentiment herself, I have to smile and pretend that tomorrow might be better. I must become the accomplice of the sweet-tongued, sharp-clawed monster that is Hope and put on a makebelieve so my sister doesn't hurt herself.

I am hoping the ""Everyone Must Work!"" brigade will take a page from the Nazi playbook and put us up against a wall and shoot us. It's the only near end I can see. Otherwise, we're here like this for *decades*. I am only just turning sixty, and the Evil Pseudomother is in her late eighties.",2,1743949495.0,CaregiverSupport,3,0.75,False

I'm in a bit of a limbo between being super relaxed about stuff and super anxious this pregnancy lol. I'm currently 4w 3d

Little background. I have a 4.5 year old, he is wonderful, largely uncomplicated pregnancy. I abstained from caffeine most of that pregnancy. However, I also had a missed miscarriage in 2023 around 7-8 weeks (they said likely due to a chromosome abnormality). 

With that being said, I know the recommended limit is 200mg per day. Honestly I just want some coffee in the morning, if I don't have that maybe a soda in the afternoon. I also saw another post on here about Sparkling Ice with caffeine (70mg, no taurine/extras that are in energy drinks). 

My question is, how do we feel about this in the first trimester? I don't mind decaf or half caf most of the time, but ya girl is TIRED lol. 

Thanks in advance everyone!

Coffee or sugary drinks have no effect on me neither (idk maybe because I have insulin resistance).
