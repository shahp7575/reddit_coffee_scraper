At the moment my Sim dogs are driving me nuts, cringing at everything, the toilets, the baths, the computers, the stereos, the TV, the stove, the dishwasher, the coffee pot. Since my houses tend to be open plan it ends up with me not allowing the dog inside, which is a shame. the only other alternative is compartmentalised houses with doors loked to all bathrooms, kitchen, studies, etc. I have tried a mod but that makes no difference.

1ho6bco,https://www.reddit.com/r/Separation/comments/1ho6bco/i_feel_so_trapped/,I Feel so Trapped ,"I have big time social anxiety. I have always been nothing but a lurker on Reddit… I created a post hours ago only to delete it moments later but I’m going to try again.

My husband and I were married for 17 years, together for 18. I am 36 years old and he is the only man I have ever been with or loved. I moved into my own place mid October, and we now do a 50/50 split of our 2 children.

I am incredibly alone. I followed my husband around the country for work many times. Lost friends and connections because every move was always so far. Eventually we had 2 small children and combine that with living in a new places and being a stay at home mom I barely made friends. We have been in the small town where we now live for about 5 years. There is not a single person who lives here that I would call a friend. I struggle to put myself out there and living somewhere small and full of cliques has made it feel almost insurmountable to me. 

Our situation is so complicated and so damn hard. He was not good to me. My head knows this. It eventually got so bad and I was so low I had no choice but to leave and try to pull myself out of the darkness. He could be aggressive. Verbally and emotionally abusive. Dismissive, cruel. But he was also my love. The only one I wanted to make me feel better even if he was the one who made me feel broken to begin with. We had good times. They are never all bad and the good parts of him and the good man that he can be is what I wanted to call home until the day I died. The complicated part comes from the fact that he is my boss. The small town where we live has few choices, and even fewer if you want something that pays decently. Because he is my boss I have kept every part of our separation and the reasons why to myself. I have gone into work completely broken by his words and actions with a smile on my face and never once said a bad word about him. When I moved I simply told my coworkers we were separated and left it at that. No more detail has left my mouth. I don’t want to make my work environment weird or difficult by involving them in my private life that is also their managers private life. But now he has invited a woman he recently met on Snapchat to spend some nights at his house and then he is going to take her a community New Year’s Eve party. He bought tickets for this party at the same table as several of my coworkers. I cannot escape this and I cannot even begin to describe how I feel. I feel so trapped. I wish a hole would open up under my feet and swallow me whole. I am so embarrassed. My kids teachers will be there. My coworkers. Everyone gets to see him moving on 2 months after I moved out after our 18 year relationship. I don’t know how to ever get over this. I don’t know how to be ok. I don’t know how to avoid sobbing like a crazy person when it is inevitably discussed in front of me at work. I have no one here to help me navigate this or distract me or even come over for coffee when I’m feeling overwhelmed. He said it’s my fault for leaving, and I don’t have a say over what he does. I agree to a point. But I think he could have very easily gone to the city where she lives and left the public spectacle in our very small town out of it. Not to mention the people I have to work with after. I have not been able sleep and I have no appetite. I feel like I’m strapped into the passenger seat of a car that’s about to be driven full speed into a wall and I’m completely helpless. I can’t believe he’s doing this in this way. I wish he was better. I wish he was better so I could be with him instead, so that we could be a family and I wouldn’t feel so devastated by the thought of another woman touching the only man I have ever loved.

1ho6ann,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomenosleep/comments/1ho6ann/have_yourself_a_black_sabbath_christmas/,Have Yourself a BLACK SABBATH Christmas,"Hi. My name is Randall Huckabee, I’m a retired librarian. Mr. Excitement, that’s me. As a hobby, I’ve taken to assembling music box figurines. It’s easy, you can order them from Amazon. Since they come mostly assembled, I decided to spruce things up by replacing the music. Not an easy feat, let me tell you. They come equipped with tiny keyboards that only play certain notes. Good thing I play a mean piano.

I like jazz music. Not the over-the-top, can’t-tap-your-toes-to-it jazz, but Cool Jazz. Think: Chet Baker, Miles Davis, Dave Brubeck – and if I’m feeling extra spicy – Thelonius Monk. 

My goal was to personalize some figurines and give them to my family. Sounds nice, right? It was a good idea. It truly was. But something went dreadfully wrong.

I made six in total. One for each of my three sisters (all younger), two for my kids (all grown up now), and one for my wife. She’s deceased, but don’t get choked up about that. Life, as they say, must go on. Still, I like to think she’s here with me in this rickety old house. Same house we raised our children many moons ago. 

For the kids (and their spouses), I chose Jack and what’s-her-name from the movie Titanic. You know, the scene where they’re at the bow of the ship, arms locked, gazing at the wondrous world of the ocean. And for music, I added ‘I Will Survive’. Looking back, maybe this wasn’t such a good idea, considering the Titanic sank. But hindsight is what it is, and the irony was lost on me.

For my sisters: tiny ballerinas. As children, they’d parade in their pink tutus, dancing along to the Nutcracker. So, for the music, I chose Carol of the Bells. This was extremely difficult, let me tell you. Finding a music box with that many notes was strenuous. Plus, it’s a difficult tune to play, especially for an arthritic old fart like me. But I persevered. That’s what I do. 

For my darling wife, I wanted something special, seeing how this year would’ve been our wedding 50th anniversary, so I made her an angel who plays Louis Armstrong’s What a Wonderful World. You see, this may be my last Christmas in this rickety old house. Doctors say my time left on earth is limited. But isn’t that true for all of us? Anyway, I’m sidetracking. “Get to the point, Randy!” my wife would say. “You’re procrastinating again!”

Last week, my family showed up for Christmas dinner. We chose to have it earlier in the month, to fit everyone’s hectic schedule. The dinner was nice. My sister Maybelle (the oldest of the bunch) cooked a turkey as plump as ol’ Saint Nick, with all the fixings. My youngest son Luke and his wife brought oven-baked apple pie. Mmm mmm, good.

Then there’s Eitan, my one-and-only grandchild. A real hell-raiser, he is. Damn kid nearly burned the house down, mucking about with the candles during dinner. Although looking back, maybe that would’ve done us all a favor. 

After the Christmas feast, we exchanged gifts. The sisters got me sweaters. Not the cheap ones either. The thick, woolly ones that can endure any winter hardship. The kids chipped in and bought me a TV as big as a movie screen. They even signed me up to all the latest streaming sites. If only I could get the stupid remotes to cooperate, maybe I’d catch a show or two. But I digress.

The trouble started in the wee hours of night. By then, most of the family was gone. The sisters left shortly after the gifts were exchanged (surprise, surprise), and Paul, my oldest, left later that evening; Luke, his wife Charla, and Eitan stayed the night. Eitan, the little brat, kept mucking about with my wife’s figurine, getting his filthy hands all over it. I damn-near skinned his hide, too. Would have, if that were allowed these days. 

The boy slept on the couch, Paul and Charla slept in the spare bedroom. Paul’s old room, in fact. Ralf, my dear ol’ Great Dane, slept with me on the bed, as he always does. Sometime during the night, a creature was stirring, but it wasn’t a mouse. Nor was it quiet. 

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I shot out of bed like a firecracker. Where’s the banging coming from? And why so friggin’ loud? Figuring it was the neighbors having a party, I buried my head under the pillows.

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

I nearly fell off the bed, it was that loud, and greatly distorted, like heavy metal music played full volume. I didn’t like it. Neither did Ralf. He started barking, which he rarely does. By now, the entire household was awake, wondering where the hellish racket was coming from. 

We assembled in the living room, rubbing the sleep from our eyes. Paul was hungover, I could tell. Too much eggnog. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The nightmarish noise was ear-splitting. The bass pounded our eardrums. I thought it was the TV, so I started screwing with it. I inadvertently turned it full bast which added to the mayhem. Paul was shouting at me, but I couldn’t hear him. I’m partially deaf. Meaning: if the noise was this loud to me, I can only imagine how loud it must’ve been for them.

Eitan, wearing Spider Man pajamas two sizes too small, was bawling, snot sliding down his fatty face. The kid looked like maple syrup was poured over him, and he was trying to lick it off. His mother was freaking. She stole the remote, turned off the TV, then threw the remote against the wall. Good thing it didn’t break.  

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The weight of the noise nearly knocked me over. I’d never heard anything so loud. So offensive. So rude.  

I AM IRON MAN.

The voice was sardonic and overtly cynical. A demon’s voice. And still, nobody knew where it was coming from. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The bass drum was rattling inside my brain, like some demented torturing tactic. I was shaking all over. Simultaneously sweating and cold. Hell, I thought I was suffering a stroke. A heart attack, perhaps. Then I recognized what I was hearing. It was that damned devil-worshiping group from England: Black Sabbath. 

I hate Black Sabbath. Amateur musicians, at best. But my wife loved them. Saw them in concert too. Many times. (We’d had several heated quarrels about this, but ultimately, I lost every one of them.)

What the heck was happening here? Why was Black Sabbath performing in my house? And must they play so loudly? Paul, slack-jawed, steam puffing from his cauliflower ears, was scanning every inch of the living room, grumbling. He even checked outside. Just in case. No one knew where the God-awful noise was coming from. Ralf went sniffing, searching for clues. When he approached my wife’s music box, he started barking at it.

“The music box!” shouted Paul, loud enough for the neighbors to hear. 

“What?” 

“The music box!”

“Speak up!”

This was getting ridiculous. Eitan pissed himself, like the big baby he was, urine dripping down his plump little leg. Charla was livid, shouting orders at the top of her lungs, but the boy couldn’t hear her over the blasted heavy metal music.

I started crying. I hate to admit this, but I was overstimulated. And tired. It was 3 am, for Christ’s sake. I should be sleeping. Hell, we all should be. Nothing good ever happens at 3 am. 

Eitan grabbed the harp-tooting angel and stuck it inside his mouth. The sound lowered ever so slightly, proving the racket was indeed coming from inside the music box. Impossible as it may be.

The kid’s mother was furious. “Gimme that, Eaty. Or else!”

The boy refused to give it up; instead, he leapt off the couch like a guitar villain and started rocking out, snot charging down his chin. All the while, the little angel kept blaring that devil’s music. 

HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?

“Drop dthe box, Eaty!” Charla kept shouting. 

The boy farted, and some of it leaked out. (A shart, I’d later learn.) I could’ve killed him right then and there. Amidst the chaos, Eitan threw the figurine against the bookshelf. It knocked over some books, and teetered vicariously over the edge. 

IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD?

Everyone held their breath. The bookshelf was about to topple.

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

The teetering blue angel tumbled. 

NOW HE HAS HIS REVENGE

Down came the entire bookshelf, the angel toppled by a Holy Bible. Everyone gasped. Ralf, the cowardly ol’ pooch, disappeared into my bedroom, whimpering. 

We stood transfixed, reveling in the resounding silence. A platoon of hardcovers, mostly Harry Bosch, carpeted the living room floor. The lamp was broken, the light bulb shattered. None of that mattered. What scared me most was the bulky, black Bible. It belonged to my wife’s grandfather, who brought it over from Sicily, way back when. I was warned never to harm it.   

The leatherbound bible boasted a creepy golden cross. Surrounding it, heavenly words I didn’t understand. Something about Christ being the King. The bible was from the Gothic era, so it looked creepy. It weighed as much as Eitan, I’d wager.

All eyes were on me. Nobody knew what to do. Hell, I didn’t know what to do either. Truth be told, I was terrified. If I thought too deeply about this, I’d go bat-shit bonkers. So, instead of standing around like an idiot, I joined ol’ quivering Ralf on my bed, leaving Paul and his wife and their sulky boy. 

Nightmares followed. While sleeping, I was assaulted by never-ending heavy metal music. Namely, Black Sabbath. Every damned song in their catalogue, as far as I could tell. Although they all sound the same. I couldn’t wake up soon enough.

They must’ve cleaned up the mess, because when I awoke, the books were in their rightful spot on the shelf, a bright new bulb lit the lamp. The Holy Bible was returned to its rightful spot on the bookshelf. Everything was hunky-dory. Except for one thing.

“Where’s the music box?”

Charla, looking twelve years older than she did the previous day, shot Paul a look. Paul gulped. They were sitting at the kitchen table, fully-dressed, sipping freshly-brewed coffee, wearing worried-sick faces. While waiting for a response, I poured myself a mug, praying last night was an elaborate hoax. Maybe they’d drugged me. Wouldn’t put it past them. 

“Um, Pop,” Paul stuttered. “The music boxes were a nice gesture…” Charla’s eyes never leaving his, “but...” Tomato-faced, he returned the gift.

I was stunned. “If you don’t want the damned thing, just say so!”  

Paul nodded. Charla squeezed his arm, then adjusted her glasses, which were too large for her thinly freckled face. 

“But…” pouted Eithen. “I want it!” 

I noticed he was wearing an Iron Man tee, which was covered in chocolate. Or at least, I hoped it was chocolate. Glued to his filthy little fingers was my wife’s music box. He pressed play. Then he farted. Overwhelmed by the abominable odour, the twirling blue angel sang. What a wonderful world indeed.  

Charla’s face matched Paul’s. What a bunch of nincompoops. After the most awkward breakfast in the history of the world, they decided to keep their gift, which was still in its box. Eitan wanted to reassemble it. The kid may be a jackass, but at least he was curious. 

After they left, I spent the day trying to figure out the new TV. Yeah, call me a stereotype-old-gaffer (which I am), but I couldn’t get the stupid thing to cooperate. Finally, after hours of mucking about, and several YouTube tutorials later, I got the stupid thing to work. I was set to retire for the night, when the phone buzzed. My sisters were calling. It was a group chat, which they’d never done. I didn’t like it. Figured someone must’ve died. 

“Hello?”

After an uncomfortable silence, Maybelle spoke up. 

“Um, Randy,” she coughed. “How are things?”

“Get to the point, May. I’m in bed.”

More coughing. I could hear a woman’s voice in the background. The voice didn’t sound pleasant. 

“That music box…” 

More muffled chatter. 

Melanie, the oldest, interrupted. “It’s possessed!”

Silence. 

“There,” her voice lowered, “I said it.”

I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, and once I started, I couldn’t stop. Even Ralph joined up, barking up a storm.

“Randy,” now Maybelle, “We’re serious.” 

“Unless,” back to Mel, “you triggered them to play Black FUCKING Sabbath, full volume.”

“Even when they’re shut off…”

“In the middle of the night!”

A chill dripped down my spine. I dropped my phone. What in blue-blazes were they gabbing about? Possessed? Black Sabbath? Then I remembered. It’s funny how the mind works. It tricks you. You see, by dinner, I’d forgotten about the mayhem from the previous night.  

“Hello?” Maybelle speaking, “Anybody home?”

“You two are off your rockers!”

I hung up. They could destroy the damned things for all I cared. I put my heart and soul into assembling those music boxes. Now this? I put my phone on silent and went to bed. Good riddance. 

…

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I snapped awake. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

“What the?”

Ralf was trembling, his puppy-dog eyes all droopy. He stood up, shaking, and hid half-under the bed.   

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The Noise. Loud as a 747, rude and mean and raucous. This can’t be happening. I’m dreaming. Must be. 

I AM IRON MAN.

My blood turned icy cold, the hairs standing tall on my arms. My testicles disappeared. As the electric guitar soared, seventy-seven years of pent-up rage came coursing through my veins. I leapt out of bed, tripped over Ralf, and fell face-first. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The music was FULL VOLUME. Everywhere at once. I hated it. I stood up (slowly this time), and pinched myself. This is real, I reminded myself. As crazy as it may be.  

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

I checked the time: 3:33 am. Somehow, this made it worse. Like a war-weathered tank, I barged into the living room, fists clenched, ready for battle. 

“Where’s the wretched box?”

My voice was drowned out by the noise. Something caught my attention. My wife, in the prime of her youth, regarding me via her framed high school picture. In it, she’s wearing a Black Sabbath tee, smiling mischievously. Taunting me. 

I turned and stubbed my toe. Damn, it hurt. Cursing my existence, I stole another glance at my wife. She’s probably having herself a good chuckle. Heck, she probably knows all the words. I was livid. I’m surprised the police aren’t banging on the door, the noise was THAT loud.

NOBODY WANTS HIM. 

Where IS the damned music box? Frantic, I scanned the living room. AHA! The bottom shelf. How in blue blazes did it get down there? And who repaired it? I knelt down and inspected it. The cracks it suffered were gone; it looked brand new. Still, something about the angel seemed wrong. Mostly, her eyes, callous and cold. Impossibly red. Heavenly pink heart-shaped wings cradled her Tiffany-blue body, tin whistle tucked between her ashen lips. But those eyes... 

PLANNING HIS VENGEANCE.

My heart, rickety as a wooden roller coaster, nearly exploded. I raced to the garage, sweating and shivering at the same time; and after a panicky search, I found my hammer. 

VENGEANCE FROM HIS GRAVE.

The blue angel tooted its whistle, fiery red eyes never leaving mine. 

KILL THE PEOPLE HE ONCE SAVED.

I swung the hammer. 

The angel exploded. 

And the music stopped. 

So did my heart. 

…

As the week passed, my health steadily improved. But not a day went by when I didn’t think about the damned music box; the cursed blue angel, who died not once, but twice. I thought about that dreadful band from Britain. And, of course, I thought about my wife.  

…

This morning, a package arrived. I wasn’t expecting anything. But then again, tis the season, right? The box was decently heavy and marked FRAGILE. When I opened the package, I gasped. 

The ballerinas. 

Not one, but all three. My good-for-nothing sisters sent them back to me! Not surprisingly, I suppose, since I’d been ignoring their texts and emails. Not just from them, but from Luke and his wife. They were enraged. Like I needed more stress. 

Disgruntled, I found a place for the ballerinas on the bookshelf. I wound up the little ballerinas, just in case, checking to see if they were jinxed. Carol of the Bells percolated from dancers as they twirled. Phew! Relief came instantaneously. 

After dinner, I retreated to the living room for some quality TV time before bed. I must’ve fallen asleep on the sofa, because around 3 am, I snapped awake. My heart sped up, then it stopped. Then it started up again, twice as fast. I groaned. This can’t be happening. Please God. Not again.

The boy farted, and some of it leaked out. (A shart, I’d later learn.) I could’ve killed him right then and there. Amidst the chaos, Eitan threw the figurine against the bookshelf. It knocked over some books, and teetered vicariously over the edge. 

IS HE ALIVE OR DEAD?

Everyone held their breath. The bookshelf was about to topple.

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

The teetering blue angel tumbled. 

NOW HE HAS HIS REVENGE

Down came the entire bookshelf, the angel toppled by a Holy Bible. Everyone gasped. Ralf, the cowardly ol’ pooch, disappeared into my bedroom, whimpering. 

We stood transfixed, reveling in the resounding silence. A platoon of hardcovers, mostly Harry Bosch, carpeted the living room floor. The lamp was broken, the light bulb shattered. None of that mattered. What scared me most was the bulky, black Bible. It belonged to my wife’s grandfather, who brought it over from Sicily, way back when. I was warned never to harm it.   

The leatherbound bible boasted a creepy golden cross. Surrounding it, heavenly words I didn’t understand. Something about Christ being the King. The bible was from the Gothic era, so it looked creepy. It weighed as much as Eitan, I’d wager.

All eyes were on me. Nobody knew what to do. Hell, I didn’t know what to do either. Truth be told, I was terrified. If I thought too deeply about this, I’d go bat-shit bonkers. So, instead of standing around like an idiot, I joined ol’ quivering Ralf on my bed, leaving Paul and his wife and their sulky boy. 

Nightmares followed. While sleeping, I was assaulted by never-ending heavy metal music. Namely, Black Sabbath. Every damned song in their catalogue, as far as I could tell. Although they all sound the same. I couldn’t wake up soon enough.

They must’ve cleaned up the mess, because when I awoke, the books were in their rightful spot on the shelf, a bright new bulb lit the lamp. The Holy Bible was returned to its rightful spot on the bookshelf. Everything was hunky-dory. Except for one thing.

“Where’s the music box?”

Charla, looking twelve years older than she did the previous day, shot Paul a look. Paul gulped. They were sitting at the kitchen table, fully-dressed, sipping freshly-brewed coffee, wearing worried-sick faces. While waiting for a response, I poured myself a mug, praying last night was an elaborate hoax. Maybe they’d drugged me. Wouldn’t put it past them. 

“Um, Pop,” Paul stuttered. “The music boxes were a nice gesture…” Charla’s eyes never leaving his, “but...” Tomato-faced, he returned the gift.

I was stunned. “If you don’t want the damned thing, just say so!”  

Paul nodded. Charla squeezed his arm, then adjusted her glasses, which were too large for her thinly freckled face. 

“But…” pouted Eithen. “I want it!” 

I noticed he was wearing an Iron Man tee, which was covered in chocolate. Or at least, I hoped it was chocolate. Glued to his filthy little fingers was my wife’s music box. He pressed play. Then he farted. Overwhelmed by the abominable odour, the twirling blue angel sang. What a wonderful world indeed.  

Charla’s face matched Paul’s. What a bunch of nincompoops. After the most awkward breakfast in the history of the world, they decided to keep their gift, which was still in its box. Eitan wanted to reassemble it. The kid may be a jackass, but at least he was curious. 

After they left, I spent the day trying to figure out the new TV. Yeah, call me a stereotype-old-gaffer (which I am), but I couldn’t get the stupid thing to cooperate. Finally, after hours of mucking about, and several YouTube tutorials later, I got the stupid thing to work. I was set to retire for the night, when the phone buzzed. My sisters were calling. It was a group chat, which they’d never done. I didn’t like it. Figured someone must’ve died. 

“Hello?”

After an uncomfortable silence, Maybelle spoke up. 

“Um, Randy,” she coughed. “How are things?”

“Get to the point, May. I’m in bed.”

More coughing. I could hear a woman’s voice in the background. The voice didn’t sound pleasant. 

“That music box…” 

More muffled chatter. 

Melanie, the oldest, interrupted. “It’s possessed!”

Silence. 

“There,” her voice lowered, “I said it.”

I laughed. It was a nervous laugh, and once I started, I couldn’t stop. Even Ralph joined up, barking up a storm.

“Randy,” now Maybelle, “We’re serious.” 

“Unless,” back to Mel, “you triggered them to play Black FUCKING Sabbath, full volume.”

“Even when they’re shut off…”

“In the middle of the night!”

A chill dripped down my spine. I dropped my phone. What in blue-blazes were they gabbing about? Possessed? Black Sabbath? Then I remembered. It’s funny how the mind works. It tricks you. You see, by dinner, I’d forgotten about the mayhem from the previous night.  

“Hello?” Maybelle speaking, “Anybody home?”

“You two are off your rockers!”

I hung up. They could destroy the damned things for all I cared. I put my heart and soul into assembling those music boxes. Now this? I put my phone on silent and went to bed. Good riddance. 

…

BOOM BOOM BOOM.

I snapped awake. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

“What the?”

Ralf was trembling, his puppy-dog eyes all droopy. He stood up, shaking, and hid half-under the bed.   

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The Noise. Loud as a 747, rude and mean and raucous. This can’t be happening. I’m dreaming. Must be. 

I AM IRON MAN.

My blood turned icy cold, the hairs standing tall on my arms. My testicles disappeared. As the electric guitar soared, seventy-seven years of pent-up rage came coursing through my veins. I leapt out of bed, tripped over Ralf, and fell face-first. 

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR. 

The music was FULL VOLUME. Everywhere at once. I hated it. I stood up (slowly this time), and pinched myself. This is real, I reminded myself. As crazy as it may be.  

HAS HE THOUGHTS WITHIN HIS HEAD?

I checked the time: 3:33 am. Somehow, this made it worse. Like a war-weathered tank, I barged into the living room, fists clenched, ready for battle. 

“Where’s the wretched box?”

My voice was drowned out by the noise. Something caught my attention. My wife, in the prime of her youth, regarding me via her framed high school picture. In it, she’s wearing a Black Sabbath tee, smiling mischievously. Taunting me. 

I turned and stubbed my toe. Damn, it hurt. Cursing my existence, I stole another glance at my wife. She’s probably having herself a good chuckle. Heck, she probably knows all the words. I was livid. I’m surprised the police aren’t banging on the door, the noise was THAT loud.

NOBODY WANTS HIM. 

Where IS the damned music box? Frantic, I scanned the living room. AHA! The bottom shelf. How in blue blazes did it get down there? And who repaired it? I knelt down and inspected it. The cracks it suffered were gone; it looked brand new. Still, something about the angel seemed wrong. Mostly, her eyes, callous and cold. Impossibly red. Heavenly pink heart-shaped wings cradled her Tiffany-blue body, tin whistle tucked between her ashen lips. But those eyes... 

PLANNING HIS VENGEANCE.

My heart, rickety as a wooden roller coaster, nearly exploded. I raced to the garage, sweating and shivering at the same time; and after a panicky search, I found my hammer. 

VENGEANCE FROM HIS GRAVE.

The blue angel tooted its whistle, fiery red eyes never leaving mine. 

KILL THE PEOPLE HE ONCE SAVED.

I swung the hammer. 

The angel exploded. 

And the music stopped. 

So did my heart. 

…

As the week passed, my health steadily improved. But not a day went by when I didn’t think about the damned music box; the cursed blue angel, who died not once, but twice. I thought about that dreadful band from Britain. And, of course, I thought about my wife.  

…

This morning, a package arrived. I wasn’t expecting anything. But then again, tis the season, right? The box was decently heavy and marked FRAGILE. When I opened the package, I gasped. 

The ballerinas. 

Not one, but all three. My good-for-nothing sisters sent them back to me! Not surprisingly, I suppose, since I’d been ignoring their texts and emails. Not just from them, but from Luke and his wife. They were enraged. Like I needed more stress. 

Disgruntled, I found a place for the ballerinas on the bookshelf. I wound up the little ballerinas, just in case, checking to see if they were jinxed. Carol of the Bells percolated from dancers as they twirled. Phew! Relief came instantaneously. 

After dinner, I retreated to the living room for some quality TV time before bed. I must’ve fallen asleep on the sofa, because around 3 am, I snapped awake. My heart sped up, then it stopped. Then it started up again, twice as fast. I groaned. This can’t be happening. Please God. Not again.

NNNNRRRRRRRRRR.

Is this something that can be overlooked or should this be stopped?,"So basically I(23F) and my bf (23M) work in the same office. 

His friends had recently joined us in the same office for the past six months and I had been going to lunch and coffee breaks with them. 

3-4 months ago, I felt that his friends were more of what he wanted and I was part of the friend group rather than being his gf.

This started overshadowing our relationship and we totally forgot spending time with each other. 

This got resolved but all i could feel is his friends being a little over important than I was??


So basically his friends start to mock my partition in my hair? Saying it looks like a highway. Whatever they mock about and fuck around he just laughs. Or pretty much says to shut up while laughing. 

His mom comments about something everytime I go visit their place. 

1. My nails are long
2. She asks me if I don't brush my hair and when I say no she gives me a look
3. She asks whether I don't put traditional outfits and only wear modern outfits 
4. I ""spoil"" her son by earing out with him. 
I literally told him about pringles and she was talking about that. 


He never told his mom not to say anything nor defended me to his friends. 

When I ask why he cannot say anything to his mom he says that his mom doesn't know that we're in love and thus is not in a place to say anything. 

With his friends he says he'll say something but will go ahead and say that their actions hurt me rather than what they're saying is wrong. 

I asked him whether I can ask their friends directly i.e., confront them about their ""joke"".
But he's terrified that I might say something and it might cause a rift between them. 
I confront him asking when I've behaved arrogant or have misused my words with someone but he simply tells me that's his feelings of me.

He also has anger issues and defends other people when they hurt us or me. 


This basically makes me feel like I'm less worth or our relationship is worth less compared to what he has with his friends and I should be an adjusting person. 


Apart from all this, our relationship is good. 
But I feel like what he's disrespectful and is not commited to change something that hurts me.
Something tells me he won't change. 
But still I don't know if this is a major issue. ",1,1735394481.0,relationship_advice,3,0.99,False

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

He refused to latch when he was born no matter what i tried so i was pumping but my milk supply couldn’t keep up so we started him on ByHeart formula and he’s been on it ever since. I was still pumping but barely getting any milk so i would give him whatever little i could get. When he was around 5 weeks old I tried to get him to latch one day and he magically did!! I still don’t produce enough to fill him up but he latches on about 2-3 times a day and then i top him off with formula. 

The thing is, he is a very fussy baby. I can tell when he’s gassy/ trying to poop because he turns bright red and i can tell he’s trying to push. I burp him but he’ll still cry and sound like he’s in pain. I now know that babies around this age tend to be fussy but my husband is questioning if maybe his formula isn’t helping and I’m wondering that now too. 

Me myself i have a slight dairy intolerance such as too much chocolate,coffee, cheese etc give me a stomach ache so now im wondering if he does too. The ByHeart formula is soy free but made with whole milk so im wondering if maybe that’s upsetting him stomach and causing him pain?? 

Maybe he’s just going through a phase as most babies do but i can’t help think that im not helping him by possibly giving him formula that isn’t compatible with him. He poops about once a day but the leading up to it seems to cause such discomfort. 

I guess I’m asking if anyone has similar experiences and if it’s just a phase or if they changed formula and saw a difference. And if you did, which formula did you try??

3. You can't lock the car with the fob outside the car. So when I restart the car, which is already annoying, I can't lock the kids in the car to run back inside for bags, the dog, my coffee, whatever my toddler forgot and now desperately NEEDS. Or if I wanted to go out and start the car and turn on the heat (see point 4), I can't lock the doors when I come back inside. 
4. Heat/seat warmers don't come on automatically. In my Grand Cherokee (2014 Laredo, so nothing especially new or fancy), when it's <40° and you remote start, the heat and seat warmers and front defroster automatically come on full blast. Sienna just seems to come on whatever the setting were when you got out last. 

Are these problems solved in the higher trims? Or am I missing something? These seem like such obvious issues I'm amazed every time. ",2,1735394140.0,Sienna,3,1.0,False

For me, it’s how warm it is inside EVERY SINGLE BUILDING no matter the weather outside. It’s especially noticeable (to me, at least) in the summer when it’s a chilly/windy/rainy day, I’m bundled up, and go into a coffee shop. 

My first few times in Iceland I’d take layers off after going inside. Now, I take layers off BEFORE going inside.

I know it seems like such a minor thing, but it’s made a huge difference in terms of me being comfortable.

# #NATURAL WRITING FOR YOUR NEWSLETTER💌:

**Instructions:** 

`Use this structured approach to craft content that’s not only natural and clear but also engaging, relevant, and action-oriented.**`

	`**•**	**Example 2: “A client once told me their blog wasn’t converting. We rewrote the intro to address the reader’s problem. Conversions tripled.”`

**5️⃣ Integrate a Feedback Loop**

`Add self-check questions to ensure the content aligns with the goal.`

	•Ask This:
	• Does this sentence make sense instantly?
	• Is this something I’d say out loud?
	• Can I cut any fluff without losing meaning?

**6️⃣ Enhance Engagement with Subtle Techniques**

	• Example 1: “What if you could write an entire blog post in half the time?”
	• Example 2: “Think of writing as cooking: the fewer unnecessary ingredients, the better the dish.”

**7️⃣ Optimize for Clarity and Skimmability**

`Break up long paragraphs and use bullet points or headings for readability.`

	• Example 1: “Here’s how to simplify your content:
	❶ • Use short paragraphs.
	❷ • Write clear headlines.
	❸ • Get to the point fast.”

	• Example 2: “In just three steps, you can:
	❶. Edit faster.
	❷. Write clearer.
	❸. Engage better.”

She didn't ask questions and responses became terse, so I figured ok she's not interested. She hung around a while then unmatched. We matched again on Bumble, and she doesn't remember me (or I think not). We're having a good chat, but I'm again asking most of the questions, and I'm feeling like maybe she wants me to make a move. I put my phone number as a by-the-way mid convo and said happy to stay on the app. Convo continues on the app. We're chatting more, and I say that I'm up to coffee this weekend, and then we chat about our favorite music. I think late at night, I was last to message asking her favorite food. The tone of everything seemed alright, but because she didn't ask questions, it was hard to even maintain a conversation, But she seemed nice and she is very pretty and my age, and she kept responding back up to that point. Haven't heard back since last night though.

She does work as a therapist, so maybe she is testing me out? What is this? Maybe she messages over days, but that is pretty uncommon.

I’ve held my hands up and said I was totally wrong but she has ended it stating that I humiliated her, made her feel intimidated and she no longer sees a future together.

I’ve been terrible at no contact for the first 3 weeks, however there has been a couple of times where she has messaged me although being adamant we are done. The first time was a week after to let me know she had a puncture on her tyre as we would often laugh she could never catch a break. She didn’t want me to sort the tyre as she let me know when it was already fixed.

Then, I continued to try and fix things which caused her to pull away harder and she messaged me telling me I had ruined things, she really loved and appreciated me but she doesn’t want to be with me, however in time when we have processed the breakup she would love to be friends as she thinks I’m an amazing person. 

At that point, 10 days ago I had accepted that it was over and prepared myself to focus on myself and start therapy to address my issues of sometimes being jealous and insecure, that was an issue in our relationship that I had been delaying to work on.

The day after this, she messaged me asking if she could watch a movie on my Netflix and then she would log out, I told her it’s fine, no need to log out, I wouldn’t have even noticed her using it. We exchanged a few light hearted messages and the conversation came to a natural end. The following day in the morning, she text me again to say she was annoyed we have fallen out because she had been laughing at something that she knew I’d find funny. I playfully messaged back saying “well, we can just stop falling out” to which she responded saying “no 🤣”, I asked her to tell me what was so funny, she told me and then quickly said “anyway, bye” and cut the conversation.

The next day, I messaged her to say evidently we are both upset we have fallen out, can we not try and talk and work on fixing things and I’m also taking the steps to work on me too. I also said that I’d bought her some Christmas presents that I’d appreciate if she would accept, I understand if she didn’t want to see me but if she would accept them I’d leave them by her front door and then leave to respect her boundaries.

She replied on Christmas Eve, saying ok, I’ll accept them, you can come in for a coffee and a gossip and don’t give me a sad face. She struggles with emotion and generally it makes her feel uncomfortable.

So, I spent a couple of hours with her and it was just nice to hang out, we genuinely get on so well and I said do you think we could ever make this work? She said no, she doesn’t, seeing that aggressive nasty side of me scared her and she has a 5 year old daughter to consider and her primary goal is creating a home of happiness and safety. I explained that I was prepared to not touch a drop of alcohol again, work on myself and take baby steps but she said she just doesn’t think it will work. She said she was so upset, I’d met her daughter a couple of times and it made her so happy watching me play with her and she can’t stand the thought of having to date again and start over. I told her I don’t want to date anyone else, I just want her and to make it work.

She then asked me what I was doing on Christmas Day as she knows I don’t really have any family and the family I do have, we don’t speak. I explained I’d just be at home, she said that made her sad and I told her not to worry, it’s not her responsibility and this is my fault. I left, we hugged and I accepted I’d perhaps not see her again, which was painful but I was glad we had seen each other on happier terms than the last interaction we had where I was drunk and nasty, at least it ended on a positive note so that there was no animosity should our paths ever cross again.

I text her when I left saying thanks for letting me see her, I miss her and would never close the door on her, if she needs anything then just call me and merry Christmas.

She replied saying it was nice to see your face.

On Christmas Day, I was forcing myself to not text her, there was no reason to. However she called me asking what I was doing, I said I was having a coffee and not much else, she said I’ve spoken to my mum and we don’t want you on your own on Christmas Day, why don’t I go and meet them at the pub for a Christmas drink. I asked if that would not just be awkward and she said no, my mum is excited to see you. So I went, I saw her, hugged her and gave her a kiss on the head and apologised to her parents for how I had behaved that night and that I wasn’t proud of myself. Her mum said that’s the first step, just give her time, I told her I’ve done everything to try and fix it but she won’t let me in.

Her mum then insisted I go back to the family home to join them for dinner, I said only with my ex’s blessing as I don’t want to encroach on their day, my ex said it’s fine, her mum suggested I stay over in one of the spare rooms and my ex said that’s where I draw the line and I agreed that is perhaps a little too much.

We had a lovely day together, it got to around 4pm and my ex then had to go and pick her daughter up as she had spent Christmas Day morning at her dads this year, I said I’ll leave to not make it awkward but she said it’s fine, chill, have fun and dinner hasn’t been served yet.

When she left, her parents sat down with me and said she’s really hurt, but she saw a future with you, she really liked you and was just starting to open up, especially after your holiday in September, but due to how her ex treated her she’s just got a very low tolerance for things now. I explained how I felt and that I wanted to make it work, her parents agreed they really like me but they can’t interfere but just give her time, the best way is to back off a little bit and give her space and that if I’m going to therapy, told her how I feel then there’s nothing more I can do.

After I left on Christmas Day, I sent her a heartfelt message of gratitude for what she’d done, told her I loved her and that I’m willing to take baby steps to fix this and I hope to see her again.

Since then, she’s gone back to radio silence. I find myself wanting to call her or text her to ask if we can just meet up and talk but everything I read says go no contact; which technically we have not done for more than a few days before it breaks, usually by me trying to get in touch with her.

I am genuinely so confused and have no idea what to do, hence venting on here and asking others thoughts and opinions?",1,1735393214.0,ExNoContact,2,1.0,False

1ho5unc,https://www.reddit.com/r/projectzomboid/comments/1ho5unc/feedback_after_60h_build_42_is_opposite_of_qol_by/,"Feedback after 60h. Build 42 is opposite of QoL by the design. It is annoying at best for veterans, uninstall for newer players.","So I am sort of B41 newcomer with like 1k hours into PZ. I find standard B41 PZ quite an easy game once you get hold of controls and level up paranoia to 10. This is why I usually play with at least 30% sprinter pop, water goes bad, instant shutoff and grabby zombies to name some of difficulty mods. And my loot settings was always the lowest setting in sandbox... and it felt fine.

Now with build 42 there are a lot of things that does not make any sense even for more experienced player.  I play with standard loot settings with 15% sprinters and grabby zombies. I feel like the B42 intend was to make the game as annoying as possible.

**First of all literature and armor recipes.** It's bad. Magazine armor requiring recipe? It is tedium, not difficulty. With numerous characters surviving for a week and my current char at second month with base at Muldraugh school I am yet to find a single Generator magazine. Another day I raided Muldraugh book store and it had 5 skill books in one shelf and 0 magazines, same with Fallas Lake bookstore. And this is with standard loot tables. 0 Generator magazines in 60 hours of gameplay. It is so bad that I am considering to use Electrician build over carpenter, since carpenter is just pure garbage with current game design.

**TV nerf.** Carpenter starts at level 3. Now it is useless profession when you play with electricity on at start. Anyone can level carpentry to level 3 with TV in a week, but carpenter literally get 0 starting advantage over any other profession due to TV nerf. TV nerf was necessary. But it was done at a cost of VHS removal and whole profession becoming useless. Hard cap is bad. Just XP nerf and balancing would have been better to avoid week 1 level 8 carpentry power leveling. Or better yet with increased amount of skills TV programming can be randomized with extra TV shows for different skills, carpentry at 12 can be just a relic of the past...

**Unnecessary grind and separate skills.** It is MMORPG design to be fair... To be realistic... well, it is idiotic for mostly single player game with hardcore permadeth. Separating woodworking and metalworking into 2 separate skills was unnecessary. Carving should not be a separate thing. Extra skills also dilutes book loot tables making even standard literature loot a joke. Removing disassembly XP is bad. Only reason why it was meta was the time/reward ratio. Now it will just shift to the next best thing, like spamming socks. Every action should reward XP, only XP amount should correlate to the time spent doing things.

**Bugs.** 

**-** Nails are infinite when in backpack.

\- Coffee maker use the whole coffee bag for 1 mug of coffee.

\- Soda is super OP and broken. Chicken is worse than vegetables.

\- Bread use the whole bag of flour.

\- You can infinitely butcher rabbits from containers like a fridge.

\- When making thread from rags it create 5% thread. When consolidated together it is destroyed.

\- Screwdriver and Big Flashlight do not work properly when favorited. You cannot use them to replace battery or disassemble stuff.

\- I cannot plumb sinks to rain collectors above on the roof, like it was a thing in B41. (maybe some bugs with everything situated on 2nd and 3rd floor)

**Muscle Fatigue.** Its ok. But! I play high strength (9-10) runner builds. With short blunt at level 3-4+ I can dispatch hundreds of zeds in a day. It is clear that for lower strength 0 weapon skill it is brutal, but I think it should be this way. It should enforce weapon skills and traits. Also punishment for carrying around fridges and constantly lunging 2.5 meter fences is something necessary. It was to easy in build 41.

**Building and crafting menu + 4k UI.** Even with ""what I can craft"" mod it still quite bad. Cooking is borderline broken with new liquid system. Context menu was better. A lot of things is so unclear, that I only realized that I can craft thread from rags with mod installed. Something like spin wheel menu should be a thing. Overlaying screen with huge build menu in a game about hardcore permadeth is bad. 4k UI is clearly not tested and broken for animal zones and liquid transfer system.

**Propane and battery drain over time**. Sorry but it is idiotic. Either it is a bug, or someone really think that draining propane tank or a battery in a week is ok. Now to store propane you need to have like array of BBQs. Batteries can be stored in shelved radios. System is unnecessary, broken, tedious and unrealistic.

On the opposite side, I think mappers have done really nice work and animals feels like a really nice addition to the game. Still enjoying B42 and feel like with proper balancing and UI design it can be really awesome in the future!

I'm considering a full-time move to Newport from Boston and I'm curious how dog friendly Newport is and what the community is like for dog owners. 

The neighborhood I live in in Boston is extremely dog friendly and my dog often comes to the coffee shop, the grocery store, restaurant patios, etc with me (and he'll carry the bags all the way home) and we have a ton of dog parent friends in the neighborhood, so he always has a playmate and I've made a strong wonderful community here just through him and being out and social in the park. 

I'd really hate to give that up and not have something to fill the void, but I'm just getting sick of living in the city and I'm getting priced out of living there in any comfortable housing situation. Just trying to build a happy easy life for us by the water and we love RI.

I also regularly take him to the beach to play and go swimming, especially in the warmer months, so I'm curious if I'd still be able to do that if I were to move to Newport.

This foundational truth shapes every moment of our lives, including how we begin each day. When we acknowledge that our purpose is to savor God’s goodness and reflect his glory, even our mornings—often hurried and mundane—become opportunities for worship.

Starting the day with God is essential. King David exemplified this in Psalm 5:3: “O LORD, in the morning you hear my voice; in the morning I prepare a sacrifice for you and watch.” Jesus also modeled this practice by rising early to pray, even during his busy ministry (Mk 1:35). Beginning with prayer and Scripture allows us to reorient our hearts toward God, setting the tone for a purposeful day.

Simple changes can transform your mornings. Begin with a prayer of gratitude as you wake. Thank God for his mercies, which are new every morning (La 3:22). Spend a few minutes reading Scripture or reflecting on a verse. Even mundane tasks like making coffee or showering can become acts of worship when approached with a heart of gratitude.

### What Makes an Asshole an Asshole?

Imagine assholes as the “grumpy cats” of human behavior. They strut around like they own the place, often wondering why others just can’t see that they’re the stars of the show. So what are the classic “asshole” traits?

1. **Empathy? What’s That?**: Assholes are like those people who step on your foot without even realizing it—mostly because they're too busy strutting their stuff. They just don’t get that you might not be thrilled to be a walking rug for their ego.

2. **Self-Centeredness**: The poster child for self-absorption, an asshole often thinks that the world revolves around them… and maybe the one pizza place that delivers. Their favorite phrase? “I’m not arguing; I’m just explaining why I’m right.” 

3. **Communication Fail**: Ever try talking to an asshole? It’s like trying to teach a cat to fetch. You can throw a point out there, but they’ll probably just stare at you like you’re speaking Martian. “Did you say something? I was too busy thinking about how awesome I am.”

4. **Mood Swings**: You might see them at a party; they’re charming, telling jokes, and making everyone laugh. Then, boom! They stub their toe, and suddenly they’re auditioning for a role as the villain in a soap opera. “I can’t believe they put the snacks over there! What is this, Hunger Games?!”

### Once an Asshole, Always an Asshole?

Ah, the golden question! Is it true that once someone earns their “asshole” badge, they're doomed forever? Like a reality TV show contestant, it’s complicated!

- **Self-Awareness**: If an asshole suddenly has an epiphany—“Wait a minute, maybe not everyone’s out to ruin my day!”—there’s hope for redemption. If they take a moment to reflect, they might just have a tearful realization while staring into a mirror. “Can I say I’m sorry over an entire gallon of ice cream? Because I might have to.”

- **Environmental Factors**: Let’s face it, sometimes we all act like jerks because life throws a pie in our face. Stress can transform even the most mild-mannered folks into raging tornadoes. Picture an asshole dealing with a hangry reaction: “I’m not an asshole! I just need food and coffee before my personal apocalypse begins!”

- **Support and Encouragement**: If you know someone who might need a little nudge toward the “Human Being Who Cares” club, just remind them that there’s life beyond the “asshole” title. A little kindness can go a long way—like giving them a “Get Out of Jail Free” card, but instead it’s a piece of cake. “Don’t worry, buddy, I brought dessert. Let’s talk it out!”

### Is It Human Nature?

Oh, absolutely! At the core of it, we’re all imperfect beings. Think of it like having a room filled with chaotic children. One minute they’re playing nicely, the next someone spills juice and suddenly it’s like a scene from a disaster movie. “What’s that? Oh, just my dignity lying here in the juice.”

Ultimately, we all have our moments. Just look at your dog: one minute, they’re all cuddly; the next, they’ve decided your shoe is a chew toy. It happens!

### Final Thoughts

So, if someone’s being an absolute jerk, remember: it’s just human nature having a comedic episode. We’re all capable of a little assholery from time to time. Just remind yourself, we’re all on this rollercoaster ride called life, occasionally flinging popcorn at one another while yelling, “Wheee!” If someone needs a little help climbing back to the human side, simply smile, share a laugh, and remind them we all miss the target sometimes. Because, at the end of the day, we’re all just trying to figure out how to dodge the banana peels life throws our way! 🍌",1,1735392266.0,theassholeclub,0,1.0,False
1ho5kyl,https://www.reddit.com/r/weatherfactory/comments/1ho5kyl/locksmiths_dream_review_and_thoughts/,Locksmith's Dream review and thoughts,"I saw that the guys behind Locksmith's Dream posted some new dates for next year (https://www.locksmithsdream.com/shows), and after posting a similar review for The Lady Afterwards here last year, I figured I would share my thoughts as someone who visited. Most reviews about the experience is at least somewhat sponsored (though I don’t doubt it is honest) so I wanted to give a mostly unbiased, mostly spoiler-free view of our experience for any weather factory fans considering going.

As always, this is my opinion and my opinion only, and there are likely going to be people who disagree or with some or all of it 😊

**Who am I?** Me and my partner are escape room fans, and also fans of the Secret Histories universe, primarily from playing Book of Hours and a longer Lady Afterwards-based TTRPG campaign. We visited during a vacation in Great Britain last year.

**What is The Locksmith’s Dream?** In their own words, The Locksmith’s Dream is an “immersive and interactive overnight experience like no other”. You spend 24 hours (quite literally 24 hours – the game continues untill 12 the next day) at an old country manor, embedded in the Secret Histories universe, solving puzzles, interacting with a cast of actors, experiencing events and story developments, and lots of other cool stuff. It is hosted in the historic manor of Treowen in Wales for a small amount of people each event – I think we were mostly full, around 18 guests attending out of a max of 22.

The meta-narrative is that you are sent by an occult sponsor (Secret Histories stables like the Lighthouse Institute or Orriflamme’s) to discover secrets and artifacts from the house, and are so nominally allied with some other attending couples collecting for the same sponsor.

**How integrated is The Locksmith’s Dream in the Secret Histories mythos?** The game was originally written by Alexis and Lottie, but has since moved on to be a product of the Secret Histories open game license – mostly, I was told, to make it easier to shift things around a bit as the game evolved over the years. I was positively surprised in that the core narrative and the actors remained true to the story of the Secret Histories, and that corners weren’t cut to make the experience more appealing to a broader audience. I had several fairly lore-heavy conversations with the actors, and while a few of them admitted after the experience that lore-nerds had stumped them in the past, I had a lot of fun.

**The good:**

**The actors make everything.** This is really the most important point, because the entire experience would fall apart basically immediately if the actors and staff weren’t fully committed to the bit. But everyone at Treowen perfectly juggled staying in character, being helpful if you were stuck, interacting with each other in planned and unplanned ways, and otherwise making the entire house feel alive. They were there to make us coffee when we looked tired, to engage us in conversation when we needed it and to leave us alone when we didn’t. It is a razor thin line to manage, and they did it well – for a full 24 hours, too, which is sort of amazing.

**The location is excellent.** Treowen is a beautiful location, and it is practically FILLED with props, puzzles, mysterious quotes and things to find. The game systems encourage exploration, and very few parts of the house are closed off. We spent hours just wandering around with notebooks and a cup of coffee exploring and finding things.

**The game systems are mostly really cool.** The core, mechanical gameplay is centered around spintrae – Secret History-themed currencies you receive as rewards for different types of puzzles and activities. Find a hidden key and open a puzzlebox? Simple puzzle, here is a wood spintrae. Solve a devillish puzzlebox riddle and share a secret with an actor? Here is a rarer iron spintrae. It is a smartly designed system where every type of puzzle and interaction is rewarded with a physical token, and where you always have this feeling of ‘just one more’ chasing around the house.

There is also a lot of different types of puzzles rewarding different activities – from solving an occult crossword to solving cryptexes with Secret Histories lore to finding hidden triptychs. There is a lot of different things to do, and if you don’t want to engage with one system (we rapidly became tired of matching keys with lockboxes) there is always going to be something else to do.

**The props.** I am a sucker for physical media (which might be why I loved The Lady Afterwards as much as I did) and The Locksmith’s Dream does not disappoint here. We came home with a stack of pins, notebooks, folders, hidden notes, and a ton of other fun and memorable stuff we picked up along the way. And you are routinely given other things to expand your experience or for use during the event. 

**The so-so:**

**The location is out of the way.** Treowen is (as mentioned) a beautiful venue, but it is also located in the hills of Wales, \~1½ hours from London. If you come from London and don’t have a car, the only way to get to the venue on time is to take a train to Newport and then a cab – and even with planning ahead, the total cost of transport to and from Treowen added \~300 GBP to the price. Including after-dinner drinks, transport and accomodations, we were closer to 1000 GBP per person for the full experience. Which is fine, but it all adds up.

**Not all game systems were perfectly thought out.** It mostly worked, it sometimes didn’t. A lot of official reviews spend a lot of time talking about ‘Grand Birdsong’, which are the sort of culmination of the day’s puzzle experience – your sponsor is interested in a number of physical artifacts hidden in the house, and you get to go look for those, hidden behind devillish puzzles, in secret compartments and a lot of other exciting stuff.

We were VERY excited to get started on finding one of those, but it turned out that spending 10 minutes on an after-dinner drink with another couple meant that basically everyone else was now ahead of us.. Which turned out to be true, as we ended the night without getting a Grand Birdsong of our own. This is somewhat compounded by the fact that there is little to encourage cooperation between players – everyone is mostly chasing their own goals and keeping their cards close to the chest, to avoid someone snatching a clue or a Birdsong in front of their noses.

I should note that none of this soured our experience in the end – the (always wonderful) staff helped us find other secrets and puzzles, engaged us in in-character conversation, revealed more of the narrative and generally made sure that everyone felt included. But I think some more focus on letting everyone participate in finding a Birdsong – and more heavily encouraging cooperation between attendees – would have been even better.

We heard from another couple, who had a similar experience at Locksmith’s Dream but had attended the Key of Dreams previously, that these things felt better in the other production. So maybe this will be changed for the fall 2025 events.

**The experience is mostly going to really shine for fans of escape rooms/puzzles.** This is a minor point, but the marketing spends a lot of time noting that you can experience The Locksmith’s Dream your way. And this is mostly true – you can easily spend hours chatting with the actors, learning lore, taking walks, doing a (literal) puzzle and having a drink by the fire. But the full experience, excluding food, sleep and planned events, is still \~10 hours. And if you don’t intend to spend the majority of that time engaging with the game systems, I doubt you will really feel like you are getting your money’s worth.

**Do I recommend going?**

Yes, I do. It was easily the highlight of a wonderful trip, and though we were tired, reached 25.000 steps and were thoroughly socially spent by the time we were done, it was a a truly unique experience. And I think that is really the main selling point: I have done all kinds of escape rooms, LARPs, immersive theatre and other types of events, and I have never experienced anything quite like it. For that alone, it deserves recognition from me. I also just want to give it some general visibility, because I think it is an amazing idea and I love that someone adapted the Secret Histories universe in such an innovative way.

So I measured out the 18 grams of coffee beans, popped them into the hopper, and changed my grind size, but what to do from there? I’ve been using the auto setting and set the grinding time to 20 seconds. How do I know the time to set for the grinding? I’ve been seeing people use varying times with no explanation. 

I thought it would automatically stop before the 20 seconds if there aren’t any beans left, but I was wrong. Am I possibly damaging my grinder by letting it grind for the whole 20 seconds while there might not be enough beans in the hopper?

1ho5jmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1ho5jmj/from_studio_to_spotlight_the_art_of_music/,**From Studio to Spotlight: The Art of Music Marketing Without Losing Your Soul**,"**Let's Talk Music Marketing: Hype vs. Heart**  

Ah, music marketing. The thing all of us love to hate but can’t live without. Whether you’re a garage band, an indie artist, or someone putting out lo-fi beats at 2am, it’s safe to say you *need* to market your music. I know, I know—most of us would rather write another verse, play another riff, or tweak another track than tackle the ""promotional"" stuff. But the truth is, even the best song in the world can go unnoticed if no one knows it exists. So, let’s break it down: how do you market your music without selling your soul?  

### 1. **The Golden Rule: Know Yourself Before You Sell Yourself**  
This might sound cheesy, but honestly, if you don’t know who you are as an artist, your marketing is gonna flop. Are you a mysterious, enigmatic producer? A cheerful indie duo that makes music for road trips? A hardcore metal band ready to melt some faces?  

Your image and vibe need to line up with your music. Fans want authenticity—don’t try to copy what’s trending just because it worked for someone else. If you feel like a walking ad campaign, you’re doing it wrong.  

⚠️ **Quick Tip:** Write down five words that describe your music and aesthetic. Then, look at your social media. Do they match up? If not, time for a branding overhaul.  

### 2. **Stop Yelling and Start Connecting**  
Nobody likes to be screamed at: “LISTEN TO MY SINGLE! STREAM IT NOW!” Relax, friend. You want people to love your work, but spamming links is a one-way ticket to the mute button.  

Instead, focus on building relationships with your audience. Fans love feeling like they’re part of your journey. Share snippets of what goes on behind the scenes—studio sessions, goofy rehearsal outtakes, that late-night coffee run you needed just to finish your mix.  

🎵 **Engagement Idea:** Ask your followers questions! “What should I name this track?” “Vote—Is this bridge fire or nah?” People interact more when they feel involved. Plus, it makes your page way more fun.  

### 3. **Content Is (Still) King**  
I know, groundbreaking advice, right? But hear me out: people consume music visually as much as they do audibly these days. You don’t need to drop $10K on a fancy video (unless you can—then go off). What matters is you create content consistently. Short TikToks and Instagram Reels showcasing your music or process go a long way.  

👉 **Content Examples You Can Try THIS WEEK:**  
- A quick clip explaining the story behind your latest song  
- A silly video of you trying to play your old material and failing  
- A short performance of you acoustically covering your own track  

You don’t have to overthink it. Creative is better than perfect.  

### 4. **Market Smarter, Not Harder**  
Before you spend your entire budget on ads, ask yourself: who’s your target audience? Spoiler alert: “everyone” is not the right answer. If you make ambient piano music, dumping money into a TikTok that gets shown to gamers who want upbeat workout tracks isn't helping you.  

Find small, niche audiences who actually vibe with your sound. Collaborate with micro-influencers, submit to playlists in your genre, and engage with communities that fit your style. It may take longer, but it’s way more effective than throwing spaghetti at the wall and hoping it sticks.  

💡 **Pro Hack:** Use platforms like Submithub, Groover, or Playlist Push sparingly to pitch your tracks to curators. Just keep it legit—don’t fall for bots or sketchy services.  

### 5. **Remember What Matters**  
When in doubt, focus on the music itself. All the flashy promos and gimmicks won’t help if your work doesn’t make people *feel something*. Ask yourself this: are you building hype, or are you building *connections*? One is fleeting, and the other builds lifelong fans.  

Look, I get it—music marketing can feel overwhelming, especially when so many artists are out there hustling like never before (thank you, internet). But it’s also an incredible time to share your art with the world. Channel the same energy you use to write, compose, or perform into building your audience. That passion? That’s what people will connect with, not just the hashtags you throw on your posts.  

So… how are you marketing your music right now? Crushing it? Struggling? Avoiding it like it’s your ex? Let’s share some advice and figure it out together!   🌟",1,1735392079.0,Songstuff,0,1.0,False

I decided to share it with you guys because I thought it might be helpful to many of you, as a lot of people struggle with this:

""Let’s say you get married to a model.

At first you’re ecstatic, I assume. And when she has sex with you later on…it feels so good. Physically. Emotionally. Just pure bliss.

A few weeks pass.

You get used to seeing this woman on your bed. It’s Saturday. You take her out to a cafe, and attempt to have a conversation. You try talking about the latest movies, politics, whatever. At first you’re smiling. After a half hour, you look like you’re about to fall asleep. Her answers are so generic. So boring. You would NOT love this lady if it weren’t for her face. And her smile.

A few months pass.

You come in after a long day of work. Tired. You look at her face, and think, “Oh shit.” She starts to complain about absolutely nothing, completely oblivious through the shit you go through every day to make money for the two of you. Calmly, you tell her to be quiet, just for today. She immediately starts yelling at you as if you’re the one who isn’t cooperating.

A few years pass.

You’re spending as much time away from home as possible. Drinking with your friends, lounging at the library. Wait a minute. What’s today’s date? It’s your wedding anniversary.

*She may be a pain in the ass, but at the end of the day…she’s still my wife*, you think. You feel sorry, and head home with a bouquet of flowers, or whatever.

She’s sitting behind the coffee table, with a bunch of papers in her hand. You’re about to talk to her when you look at the papers more carefully. “Divorce Notice,” they say. Before you can even ask why she starts bitching about her own problems, how life is all about her, you look like a piece of shit, I’ve met better guys than you, bla bla bla.

A decade passes.

You are a single, lonely depressed man. Your friend creates the world’s first time machine, and starts selling it. You’re the first one to buy it.

You head back to your younger years, a good month before you met that model.

You notice your friend walking home from work. Single, and probably to remain that way since she’s not the most attractive. You head to her home. Talk. You remember how much fun it was to be with her, and from there on continue your friendship. She’s so fun to talk to it’s not her face you remember. It’s her words.

Friendship evolves into love.

You start a family, enjoy your free time heading out to restaurants and movies with an equally lovable child of your own, and live your life in content. She always has something to talk about. And so do you. You forget that model even existed.""

As the title says, I am in need of some advice regarding my mother
Context: I am a 29 year old male currently living in and out of the house I have always stayed with my parents since childhood. In and out of the house meaning starting 2024 I started for the first time spending more than a day sleeping in a place different than at my parents' place. My mother has always been strict regarding spending the night at others' place saying she doesn't understand why you would want to sleep in a different bed than yours and that you can do enough activities until midnight so you can home. 
I am in a relationship for now 11 years and my partner used to live with his parents as well so indeed we would usually meet during the day and we would go at each other's home for the night. And we were OK with that for many years (we were also still very young). We are also both gay so life was extra complicated on this aspect. 
But since this year his parents left the house and he invited me in. So for most of this year I stayed at his home coming to my mother's only when his parents came home for errands and I am very happy and I think healthy to do that. 

Now the issue - since my father passed my mother gradually lost her will to do many things in her life. She was never the one to always try something new but I remember no issue before the event mentioned. Nowadays she would watch her Turkish soap operas, drink coffee and smoke and work. Important detail I think she does still consider some activities morally important and she does not slack there like for work for example or to care for me when I ask her for support.

My worry is that life is passing very fast and for years now she seems to not have enjoyed life (I don't condemn that considering some events in her life) and I want to help her somehow see the many possibilities life has to offer still. She is 57.
Additionally I feel very close to her and I would be willing to go back home to help for short time but I myself deal with similar issues which I am working on and for the last times being home triggered the same feeling not wanting to do much or having to work extra to be able to get in that mindset

Any advice please?

I bumped a cup of coffee on my desk and it spilled across, down to a Linksys LS105 unmanaged switch. I took it apart to clean it and I think I damaged an inductor (see images below). In my limited knowledge of electronics, I think I broke the ferrite core, but the wire is still connected. I pushed it down so the upper half is resting on the lower half. (Alas, I'm currently separated from my tools, so I cannot really do anything to fix this one, e.g. replace the inductor or even check continuity.)

The device itself works and I am using it right now. What I'm worried about is not so much damage to the device (I ordered a new one but it will take several days to get to me), but any more serious damage. Is there any risk of using this until the new one arrives? As in, I know this sounds stupid, but can it start a fire or something like that?

I can't find the schematic for this thing so I have no idea what inductance (I think that is the word) this little dude is taking. The switch itself takes 12V, 0.5A power according to its [manual](https://downloads.linksys.com/downloads/datasheet/en/LGS105_LGS108_English.pdf).

Been a long, long time since I posted something here. I’ve moved on but I still feel unhappy sometimes even though I should be satisfied as I’m in a new relationship.

I’ve been in no contact for almost two years now. Almost 3 years since we broke up. We dated for about 6 months but those 6 months were probably the best I’ve ever had.
 I decided to do no contact as soon as we broke up. It really really fucked with my head. We didn’t speak for about 5-6 months. 
Technically neither of us initiated contact for the first time. She got a job incredibly close to my house at a coffee shop. Whether this was on purpose I don’t know!
We obviously bumped into each other and it was awkward. She texts me about an hour after apologizing for not telling me she had got that job there. I remained a bit distant but told her congratulations and that was no problem for me. (That was a lie, it was a living hell)
Anyway she kept having her lunch in the park next to my house and posting stories, I have no idea if she wanted me to see these. One day I was walking in the park and saw her. I had avoided her every other time but this time I decided to talk to her. She asked me to sit with her and we chatted and laughed for ages. I asked her stupidly if she wanted to hang out. She said yes. We texted a bit after but I’m hindsight it was all off. She was really distant and then would become very responsive.
We ended up meeting for coffee a couple of times and she was really happy and laughing and it felt like she was starting to consider it again.
I asked her out again for a drink and she said yes. We never went for this drink she cancelled and didn’t rearrange even though she said she would. Contact faded again this was my choice, I knew something was wrong or felt weird.

I was left incredibly confused but I just tried to carry on. It was all I could think about for months.
My birthday came along and I didn’t expect her to even remember. 0 expectation of a message but first thing in the morning she messaged me wishing me happy birthday
For the first time in months I felt amazing and I felt like all this pain I had been through had finally paid off. However I was  so cautious because she had hurt me so badly.
I asked how she was doing and she started catching me up on her life the last few months. She asked me how my birthday was and I told her! We texted back and forth for a few days. It seemed different to the last time we had spoken she was interested and I felt so good about it.
I asked her if she wanted to meet up for a walk and she didn’t reply for about 3 days
I received a text saying that she would love to see me again but she had just gotten into a relationship and didn’t think it was good idea for the time being.
This broke me 
I wish I had just left it there but I didn’t.
I admitted that I still had strong feelings for her and I valued what we had.
She told me that she valued our relationship too but was only interested and in friendship. Wished me all the best for the future.
I never responded to that text. It still bugs me but I know there was nothing to say after that.
I just don’t understand why she did any of it - why put me through all of this again, she knew how I felt. Why would you text your ex in a new relationship 
It’s been a year and half since that happened we haven’t spoken since. She’s still with the same guy.
I found out who it was and it made me feel so insecure. Taller, more outgoing, maybe not amazingly good looking but it just made me so angry.
I went through probably the worst depression of my life trying to rid myself of the horrible images and try to move on. It was so hard. I tried dating but it was horrible and my heart wasn’t in it.
I took a break from dating and then went back to it after month or two. I slept around a bit and felt just awful about my self 
The one day I went on a date and I met someone really amazing who enabled me to feel something for someone else.
We’ve been dating for almost a year and she has been the change I needed and I was happy again. 
Life was working and I felt like I was finally out of the darkness that had been engulfing me for so long.
But I have to admit the excitement has gone and I find myself day dreaming about my ex and stalking her socials even though I don’t follow her on anything. I dream about her a lot too. The guilt when I wake up is horrible.
I don’t really know what to do anymore, I love the person I’m dating but it gets so confusing when this comes up again.
I don’t even know what my ex is doing anymore, she doesn’t work next to my house anymore which is a relief.
I’m confused because I don’t know what I want anymore.
So that’s my story and journey, learn from my mistakes and if you have any advice n what I should do next feel free to comment, I’d really appreciate it! 
Good luck and stay strong people! You deserve all the happiness in the world!

I see so many inspiring success stories here, and I thought it’s time to share a different perspective  my story of failure.

I’m 19 now, a med student, but my passion for tech started at 15. Coming from an average middle-class family, I loved building websites and tools for fun, hoping to earn some extra pocket money. Everything was fine until my 18th birthday, when life took a sudden, devastating turn.

My father had a serious accident and fell into a coma. At that time, we had no savings, as everything was invested in our new home. That was the moment I realized I had to step up.

For a month, I juggled hospital duties, family finances, and immense pressure. While in the hospital, I started working on a free music streaming platform, hoping it could provide some financial relief. From December 12th to the 30th, I poured my heart into building the project. I launched it on December 31st, the same day my dad underwent an 11-hour surgery.

The app initially gained some traction 10 downloads on the first day. I thought, *""Maybe this could be it. Maybe this could save us.""* But life had other plans. On January 3rd, my Google Play Store and AdSense accounts were suspended, crushing all my hopes.

From January to April, I didn’t stop. I built three more products, pouring everything I had into them. I even developed a live product in just two weeks, despite having no prior experience with Next.js. I picked it up quickly, but like the others, it failed.

During this time, I cut meals to save money and lost 24 kg. I eventually dropped out of med school to work 7-hour shifts at a coffee shop, spending my remaining time at the hospital taking care of my father.

2024 was a year of constant struggle, sleepless nights, and countless suicidal thoughts. But giving up wasn’t an option.

Through it all, I’m incredibly grateful for the people who supported me. My amazing friend Pratham paid for my food for months, and my girlfriend  who I plan to marry as soon as I succeed stood by me through every storm.

Now, I’m slowly rebuilding my life, working on new projects, and hoping for the best.

I’m sharing this not for pity but to show that life’s hardships are real, even behind the success stories. If you’re struggling, know that you’re not alone. Life may knock us down, but we have the strength to rise again.

Thank you for reading, and to anyone going through a tough time: chin up, keep moving forward, and never lose hope. You’ve got this. 💪",1,1735389418.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

-loading/unloading the dishwasher

-cutlery clanking against plates

-the squeak of old trains in the subway 

-any squeaking (I live near a playground)

-construction work nearby

After reading some of the comments and doing a little digging on this sub, as well as the general ADHD sub, I took the plunge and purchased the following - 

1. Magnesium 3 in 1 (Glycinate 1000mg, Malate 400mg and Citrate 400mg) 
2. L-Tyrosine 1000mg
3. Vitamin D3 4000iu + K2 100mcg 

Today is the second day taking them and yesterday I think I did/have noticed a difference. Of course it could have been all in my head but towards the end of the day, I noticed that I wasn’t tired, at all. By around 11pm, I made the decision to wind down and attempt to sleep however, I was physically unable to do so.

Now I’m not too clued up on vitamins, minerals or amino acids etc but I did take a magnesium capsule as well as an L-Tyrosine capsule at around 9pm, which I think may have contributed to the insomnia.

As I wasn’t able to sleep much, I was awake at 5am this morning. I made myself a coffee, bowl of cereal and had a protein bar for breakfast. Following this, I took one capsule each of magnesium and L-Tyrosine and I noticed by around 8am that I was quite alert and awake. Almost like a watered down version of how Elvanse makes me feel. 

I don’t think this has anything to do with the caffeine in my coffee as typically caffeine doesn’t do anything for me except put me to sleep lol. 

I know I’m probably better off googling this but I wanted to see if anyone else had experienced something similar here. Ideally i’d like to continue taking them if they’re seeming to be bringing about positive effects however, I’m not inclined to trade this off for the inability to sleep. 

Could it have been too strong a dose? Maybe too close to the time I was planning on sleeping? Or is it just potentially a one-off instance?",1,1735389320.0,ADHDUK,8,1.0,False

Chizuru: Sure, I still have some time.

Nanami: After she graduated from high school, she joined my family business and entered a department that I was in charge of at the time. At first sight, I was deeply attracted to her. Even though she was wearing a plain uniform and light makeup as per company rules, it couldn't hide her beautiful and extraordinary appearance.

https://preview.redd.it/zv3eome63l9e1.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=b650940b4d35066b05ceef27e9ca125d4a1b0be2

Chizuru: Did you fall in love with her at first sight?

Nanami: You could say that! What surprised me was that she was not only beautiful but also very smart and hardworking. She was a great help to me at work. I quickly promoted her, and she became my assistant. We were together day and night, often working overtime together. She gradually developed feelings for me as well.

Chizuru: You're taking advantage of your position.

Nanami: No, she's genuinely capable and has a great personality. The other colleagues also respect her.

Chizuru: Working overtime all the time? Being your assistant must be tough!

Nanami: But the overtime pay from my company is pretty good. Anyway, I finally mustered the courage to confess my feelings to her. She didn't reject me, but she was very afraid of gossip among colleagues, so our relationship was kept secret. She even told me not to take advantage of my position and to be stricter with her work requirements. This happy time lasted for more than two years before it came to an end.

Chizuru: You must be marrying Mami's mother!

Nanami: That's right, her father is a wealthy businessman in America, and her mother is my mother's close friend. We played together a lot when we were kids, and our relationship was good. So we had an engagement set up early on. However, she spent her entire college life in the United States, and I hadn't seen her for a few years. I thought that engagement would just fade away. When she came back that time, it was to marry me.

Chizuru: Are you really going to give up the woman you love? Have you thought about opposing your family's arrangement? Have you considered leaving your family to be with her?

Nanami: Things are not as simple as you think.

Chizuru: You still can't let go of what your family has given you, right? It seems like Mami has more courage than you!

Nanami: You can't compare the past with the present!

Chizuru: I think Mami's mother must be an extremely beautiful mixed-race woman. You don't want to give her up, do you?

Nanami: Admittedly she's pretty, but that's not the point. Betraying the family, not only will lose everything the family has given me. Even the family and the fiancée's father will retaliate, and our future lives will be in question. But believe me, I've really thought about it. That's why I've been so troubled for a while.

Chizuru: Two beautiful women competing for you, what a happy dilemma!

Nanami: One day, my fiancée visited me at the office, and the two of them finally met.

Chizuru: Oh, this meeting must have been filled with tension.

Nanami: Not at all! They hit it off right away and became good friends. Even though my fiancée is a rich girl, she had spent most of her time living in the West, so she was more easygoing and didn't look down on someone from a humble background. Moreover, she really had no friends in Japan at that time, so she treated this girl who is a few years younger than us like a little sister. They often went out together, even taking up the time I had for overtime work with her.

Chizuru: Oh, did you feel like someone was trying to steal your love?

Nanami: I don't know what my fiancée said to her. She told me that I should accept reality and follow my family’s arrangement.

Chizuru: Did she initiate the breakup?

Nanami: She said the life of a wealthy wife was never suitable for her, but she admitted that she really enjoyed the days spent by my side.

Chizuru: So, does she want to continue being your secret lover?

Nanami: She said I was her Master, teaching her many things, and I was also her Big Brother who took care of her. She felt that was enough happiness for her and hoped this relationship could continue. However, she also said that since I was about to become someone else's husband, we should keep some distance, to avoid any issues.

*Chizuru thought: Master? Big Brother?*

Chizuru: Are you really in a relationship? She doesn't seem to think so. How have you two been interacting during this time?

Nanami: We are indeed in a relationship! But in the eyes of outsiders, I am a strict Master, and she is often the disciple being lectured by me. No one noticed the true nature of our relationship. Our dates were disguised as work outings. We mostly just went shopping, watching movies, and dining together. The topics of our conversations often revolved around work.

Chizuru: So that kind of date is essentially just working overtime.

Nanami: Looking back, to keep up appearances, I even had to approve her overtime pay each time we went out.

Chizuru: Now I understand, no wonder she wants to continue this kind of relationship. Did you have any intimate behavior?

Nanami: We were also worried about running into acquaintances in public places, so we didn’t get too close. Each time we met, it was always hurried, and we never had the chance to go to a private place just for the two of us, so the most we could do was hold hands secretly in my car.

Chizuru: Is that all? Actually, you can do a lot in the car, that’s why the agency repeatedly warned us not to get into clients' private cars.

Nanami: What kind of eyes are you looking at me with? I've always been very proper. Even just gazing at her would be out of the question.

Chizuru: I have a feeling you’re using company resources to rent a girlfriend!

Nanami: No! She’s not what you think; she’s not with me for money.

Chizuru: But over two years, you really have a lot of patience, you Playboy! Haven't you tried to take things further?

Nanami: I told you I'm not a Playboy! I get along very well with her, and just having her by my side makes me comfortable. However, she does exude a sacred and untouchable aura. Plus, she often says she has a terrifying father who is a martial arts master. If anyone disrespects his daughter, they will be torn apart.

Chizuru: A terrifying father? That must be a scare tactic!

Nanami: No, it’s true! Her martial arts skills are quite high also. One time, a colleague encountered a pervert on the train, and she subdued him in no time. She almost broke his hand, just like my colleague who got into trouble with you earlier. Later, when I asked her about it, she said those were skills taught by her father.

Chizuru: But you don’t have any chance now; her overtime hours are monopolized by your fiancée.

Nanami: Not just that! Because of her excellent work abilities, my fiancée even asked her to help with the wedding arrangements, and in the end, she even asked her to be a bridesmaid!

**Chizuru almost spat out her coffee when she heard the word ""bridesmaid.""**

Nanami: In the end, I wore a gorgeous tuxedo, and she wore a beautiful lace gown. We went through a wedding ceremony together. Of course, I was the groom, and she was not the bride!

Chizuru: You must have had very complicated feelings that day.

Nanami: The most unforgettable moment for me that day was when she smiled brightly and said to me, ""I sincerely wish the brother and sister-in-law eternal happiness and joy.""

Chizuru: This should be how things ended, but how did the daughter come about?

Nanami: After I completed the wedding and returned from the honeymoon, I had just gotten back to work when she handed me her resignation letter. She said she would be getting married in two months and would leave Tokyo to follow her husband. A month later, on her last day at work, I invited her to dinner as a farewell.

Chizuru: You had ulterior motives.

Nanami: I didn’t! It was a gathering with other colleagues. I thought it would be our last meeting. At the end of the gathering, just like before, even on dates, she wouldn’t let me take her home. She always said not to worry; any guy who had a crush on her was out of luck. So she only allowed me to walk her to the station. After she passed through the ticket gate and disappeared into the crowd, I truly felt sad. I thought I would never see her again. My mind kept replaying the happy days we had.

Chizuru (frowning): You forgot that you just got married and returned from your honeymoon? You should forget about her!

Nanami: I know, but how could I suddenly stop missing her? I can only let time gradually fade this feeling! But two weeks later, she suddenly contacted me, wanting to see me one last time before her wedding.

# What Is Gluco6?​

Gluco6 is a natural dietary supplement designed to help regulate blood sugar levels effectively and naturally. Its unique approach centers around supporting something called **GLUT-4 receptors**, which play a critical role in how our bodies process and manage glucose.

# What Are GLUT-4 Receptors?​

Think of GLUT-4 receptors as tiny “sugar gates” embedded in your cells. Their primary job is to transport glucose (sugar) from your bloodstream into your cells, where it’s converted into energy. These receptors are crucial for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels and ensuring your body’s energy needs are met.

# The Problem with GLUT-4 Receptors​

Sometimes, these “sugar gates” don’t function as they should. This often happens when we consume too many hidden sugars in common foods like bread, sauces, or snacks. When the GLUT-4 receptors become overwhelmed, they fail to properly process glucose. This can lead to blood sugar spikes (too high) or crashes (too low), leaving you feeling:

* **Tired**
* **Shaky**
* **Dizzy**

# How Gluco6 Helps​

The primary goal of Gluco6 is to improve the function of these sugar gates. By supporting the activity of GLUT-4 receptors, Gluco6 helps your body manage sugar more efficiently, promoting steadier energy levels throughout the day. It’s like giving these “sugar gates” a gentle nudge to ensure they’re working optimally.

# Why It’s a Game-Changer​

For someone like me, who often struggles with post-meal sluggishness and unpredictable energy crashes, the idea of steady, consistent energy all day sounded life-changing. Imagine no longer battling mid-afternoon energy slumps or feeling the need for a nap after every meal. Instead, you could experience:

* **Balanced blood sugar**
* **Improved focus and energy**
* **Fewer cravings and crashes**

Gluco6 takes a science-backed approach to support your body’s natural glucose regulation systems, making it a promising option for anyone looking to regain control over their blood sugar and energy levels.

# 1. Sukre: The Healthy Sugar Alternative​

Sukre is a standout ingredient described as a “healthy sugar” that doesn’t cause the same blood sugar spikes as regular sugar.

* **How it Works:** Sukre reduces the strain on GLUT-4 receptors by slowing glucose absorption, making it easier for your body to process sugar.
* **Why It’s Beneficial:** For those like me, who enjoy sweet treats but need to avoid blood sugar spikes, this ingredient offers a promising alternative.

# 2. TeaCrine: Energy Without the Jitters​

TeaCrine is derived from traditional Chinese tea and is included for its ability to provide steady, sustained energy.

* **How it Works:** Unlike caffeine, TeaCrine delivers energy without the crashes or jitters. It also supports mental clarity, helping to combat the brain fog that often accompanies blood sugar imbalances.
* **Why It’s Beneficial:** For those mid-day slumps and periods of fatigue, TeaCrine offers a smoother, more reliable energy boost.

# 3. Gymnema: The Sugar Destroyer​

Known in Ayurvedic medicine as the “sugar destroyer,” Gymnema has been used for centuries to help manage sugar intake.

* **How it Works:** Gymnema reduces sugar cravings by blocking sugar receptors in the taste buds, making sugary foods less appealing. It also supports insulin production and overall pancreatic health.
* **Why It’s Beneficial:** If you struggle with cravings for sweets, Gymnema can be a game-changer, helping you make healthier food choices and avoid unnecessary sugar.

# 4. Chromium: For Better Insulin Sensitivity​

Chromium is a trace mineral that plays a crucial role in glucose metabolism.

* **How it Works:** Chromium enhances insulin sensitivity, helping your body utilize insulin more efficiently. It also reduces blood sugar fluctuations and cravings.
* **Why It’s Beneficial:** Many people with blood sugar challenges report fewer cravings and more stable energy levels when taking supplements containing chromium.

# 5. Cinnamon: Nature’s Blood Sugar Balancer​

Cinnamon is a well-known spice with powerful blood sugar-regulating properties.

* **How it Works:** Cinnamon improves insulin sensitivity and helps your body metabolize sugar more effectively. Its antioxidant properties also provide added health benefits by reducing inflammation.
* **Why It’s Beneficial:** Incorporating cinnamon into your routine can help stabilize blood sugar while promoting overall metabolic health.

# 6. Green Tea: A Metabolism Booster​

Green tea is celebrated for its wide range of health benefits, including its role in blood sugar management.

* **How it Works:** The polyphenols in green tea improve glucose metabolism and support insulin function. Green tea also helps with weight management by boosting metabolism and providing a gentle energy lift.
* **Why It’s Beneficial:** For those working on weight management as part of their diabetes care, green tea offers a natural, supportive solution.

# Why These Ingredients Matter​

The combination of these six ingredients makes Gluco6 more than just another supplement—it’s a targeted approach to blood sugar management. Each ingredient plays a specific role, from reducing cravings and improving insulin sensitivity to boosting energy and supporting metabolism. Together, they work to provide a comprehensive solution for maintaining healthy glucose levels and improving overall well-being.

If you’re someone looking for natural support for blood sugar management, Gluco6’s thoughtful formulation could be the game-changer you’ve been searching for.

# Does Gluco6 Really Work?​

When I first came across Gluco6 and its focus on supporting **GLUT-4 receptors**, I found the concept intriguing yet couldn’t shake my skepticism. Like many people managing blood sugar issues, I’ve tried countless supplements that promised results but failed to deliver.

However, the science behind Gluco6—specifically its role in improving **GLUT-4 receptor** function—set it apart. It wasn’t just a vague claim of “balancing blood sugar.” Instead, it addressed one of the key processes in glucose metabolism. That alone made me curious enough to dig deeper and eventually give it a try.

Here’s what I discovered about how Gluco6 works and why it matters.

# What Are GLUT-4 Receptors, and Why Are They Important?​

GLUT-4 receptors are specialized “sugar gates” in your muscle and fat cells. When you eat, your body releases insulin, which acts as a key to unlock these gates, allowing glucose to enter your cells and be converted into energy. This process helps maintain stable blood sugar levels and provides energy to your body.

# The Problem with GLUT-4 Receptors​

Over time, factors like a high-sugar diet, lack of exercise, and aging can impair GLUT-4 receptors. When these gates don’t work properly:

1. **Glucose builds up in the bloodstream**, causing high blood sugar.
2. **Insulin resistance develops**, making it harder for your body to manage glucose effectively.
3. **Energy crashes become frequent**, leaving you tired and sluggish.

For people with prediabetes or diabetes, this malfunctioning process is a core issue.

# The Role of Muscle Fibers in Blood Sugar Control​

Your muscles play a significant role in glucose regulation. Here’s why:

1. **Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers (Type 1):** These are more insulin-sensitive and help absorb glucose efficiently.
2. **Fast-Twitch Muscle Fibers (Type 2):** These are less insulin-sensitive but respond to physical activity.

Studies show that individuals with Type 2 diabetes tend to have fewer slow-twitch fibers and lower GLUT-4 density, which further hinders glucose absorption.

# How Gluco6 Targets GLUT-4 Receptors​

The key to Gluco6’s approach is its focus on enhancing the functionality of GLUT-4 receptors. It uses ingredients like **Sukre, Gymnema, and Chromium** to:

1. **Support GLUT-4 Activation:** By improving how these sugar gates function, glucose is absorbed more effectively, reducing blood sugar spikes.
2. **Enhance Insulin Sensitivity:** Ingredients like Chromium and Cinnamon help your body respond better to insulin, ensuring glucose is transported into cells.
3. **Reduce Cravings and Spikes:** Gymnema works to curb sugar cravings, preventing excess glucose from overwhelming GLUT-4 receptors.

# What Science Says About GLUT-4​

GLUT-4, often referred to as the “sugar gate,” is a key player in glucose regulation. These receptors are responsible for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells, where it’s used for energy. Their proper function is essential for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and preventing insulin resistance.

# The Harvard Study​

Researchers at **Harvard Medical School** made a groundbreaking observation about GLUT-4 receptors:

* When GLUT-4 receptors in mammals malfunctioned, **50% developed diabetes within six months**.
* Conversely, mammals with fully functioning GLUT-4 receptors not only avoided diabetes but also lived **18% longer**.

This underscores just how crucial these tiny “sugar doors” are for metabolic health. When they work efficiently, they prevent glucose buildup in the bloodstream, reducing the risk of diabetes and its complications.

# My Struggles with Blood Sugar​

Like many, I’ve always had a weakness for sweets—cookies, bread, soda, you name it. A few years ago, I began noticing troubling symptoms:

* **Constant fatigue**: Even after a good night’s sleep, I’d feel drained.
* **Mood swings**: Small irritations felt overwhelming.
* **Energy crashes**: A big lunch would leave me craving a nap instead of feeling refreshed.

After a visit to my doctor, I learned that my blood sugar was out of balance. Years of sugary eating had likely overwhelmed my **GLUT-4 receptors**, leaving my cells unresponsive to insulin. The glucose that should have been fueling my energy was instead building up in my bloodstream.

This was a wake-up call for me. I needed to make changes, but I also realized I could use some support. That’s when I came across **Gluco6**.

# How Gluco6 Helps​

Gluco6 is designed to support and improve the function of GLUT-4 receptors. By using natural, science-backed ingredients, it aims to enhance glucose metabolism and reduce insulin resistance.

# Sukre: A Key Ingredient​

* Sukre, a special type of sugar, works differently from regular sugar.
* **How It Helps:** It slows down glucose absorption, reducing the strain on GLUT-4 receptors. Think of it as a gentle “sugar detox” for your body, allowing these overwhelmed receptors to recover and function more effectively.

# Other Ingredients Supporting GLUT-4 Function​

1. **Gymnema:** Known as the “sugar destroyer,” it reduces sugar cravings and supports insulin production.
2. **Chromium:** Improves insulin sensitivity, ensuring glucose is efficiently transported into cells.
3. **Cinnamon:** Enhances glucose metabolism and reduces inflammation, further supporting GLUT-4 function.

# The Role of Gluco6 in My Journey​

After learning how GLUT-4 receptors influence blood sugar control, I felt confident giving Gluco6 a try. Its science-backed approach and focus on restoring receptor function gave me hope that it wasn’t just another supplement with empty promises.

By slowing glucose absorption and enhancing insulin sensitivity, Gluco6 addresses the root causes of blood sugar imbalances. For me, it felt like a practical and effective tool to complement the dietary and lifestyle changes I was already making.

# My Experience with Gluco6​

When I decided to give Gluco6 a try, I wasn’t expecting a miracle. I paired it with healthier eating habits and regular exercise, knowing that no supplement can work in isolation. Over the course of several weeks, here’s what I noticed:

1. **Steadier Energy Levels:** My usual post-meal crashes became less frequent, and I felt more consistent energy throughout the day.
2. **Reduced Cravings:** I found it easier to avoid sugary snacks, thanks to Gymnema’s impact on my cravings.
3. **Improved Focus:** TeaCrine’s ability to provide non-jittery energy helped me stay productive, especially during long workdays.

# Why It Matters​

What stood out about Gluco6 is its science-backed approach. By targeting a specific mechanism—GLUT-4 receptor functionality—it addresses the root of blood sugar imbalances rather than just masking symptoms.

While results vary for everyone, Gluco6 felt like a genuine tool to complement the lifestyle changes I was already making. If you’ve been let down by other supplements, its unique focus on cellular glucose regulation might make it worth considering.

**Bottom Line:** Gluco6 isn’t a magic pill, but it works in tandem with a healthy lifestyle to support balanced blood sugar and energy levels. If you’re open to a supplement that prioritizes the science of glucose metabolism, Gluco6 could be a valuable addition to your routine.

# Gluco6 Side Effects: Is It Safe?​

When I started using Gluco6, safety was my top priority. Even though it’s marketed as a natural supplement, I’ve learned that being informed about potential side effects is essential—after all, ""natural"" doesn’t always mean completely risk-free.

# My Personal Experience​

For me, the transition to using Gluco6 was relatively smooth. During the first couple of days, I noticed mild **stomach discomfort**—nothing severe, just a slight adjustment period as my body got used to the supplement. By the third day, the discomfort was gone, and I didn’t experience any further issues.

# Potential Side Effects to Keep in Mind​

While most users tolerate Gluco6 well, some individuals may experience mild side effects, especially in the initial days of use. Based on my research and user feedback, here are the most common ones:

1. **Digestive Issues**
   * **Symptoms:** Mild nausea, bloating, or stomach upset.
   * **Why It Happens:** This can occur as your body adjusts to the new ingredients, particularly if you’re not used to supplements with cinnamon or chromium.
   * **How to Manage:** Taking Gluco6 with a meal and a full glass of water can help minimize these effects.
2. **Allergic Reactions**
   * **Symptoms:** Itching, rash, or mild swelling (rare).
   * **Why It Happens:** Sensitivity to certain ingredients, such as cinnamon or herbal extracts like Gymnema or bitter melon, might trigger a reaction in some people.

# Better Business Bureau (BBB)​

Gluco6 is listed with the **Better Business Bureau**, which I checked as part of my due diligence.

* **What I Found:** There are only a couple of complaints on the BBB site, mostly related to customer service. While the limited reviews don’t give a complete picture, they reinforced the importance of sticking to the official website for purchases.

# My Conclusion: Is Gluco6 Legit?​

Based on my experience, **Gluco6 doesn’t feel like a scam.** It’s a legitimate supplement designed to support blood sugar management. Here are my key takeaways:

1. **Realistic Expectations Are Key:** Gluco6 isn’t a miracle cure, and it won’t replace medical treatments or lifestyle changes. However, it can be a helpful addition to a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper healthcare.
2. **Some Improvements:** I experienced steadier energy, reduced cravings, and better overall management of my blood sugar levels. While the results weren’t dramatic, they were noticeable enough to continue using the supplement.
3. **Varied Results:** As with any supplement, results will vary depending on the individual. For those who don’t see the benefits they hoped for, the **60-day money-back guarantee** provides some peace of mind.

# Final Recommendation​

If you’re considering Gluco6:

* **Talk to Your Doctor First:** Especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are on medication.
* **Set Realistic Expectations:** It’s a tool to support your health, not a magic fix.
* **Buy from the Official Website:** To avoid counterfeit products and access the money-back guarantee.

Gluco6 worked for me as part of a broader health plan, and while it may not be for everyone, it’s worth considering if you’re looking for a natural way to support blood sugar management.

# Cons of Gluco6​

1. **Only Available Online**
   * Initially, I found it inconvenient that Gluco6 isn’t available in local stores or on popular online marketplaces.
   * However, ordering through the official website turned out to be simple, and the shipping was faster than expected.
2. **Takes Time to See Effects**
   * This isn’t a quick fix. I started noticing small changes after about two weeks, with more significant benefits appearing after a month.
   * **Patience is key.** Results build over time, especially when paired with a healthy lifestyle.
3. **Higher Cost for a Single Bottle**
   * At $69 for a single bottle, the price can feel steep if you’re on a budget.
   * I opted for the 3-bottle deal, which brought the cost per bottle down and included free shipping and bonuses, making it more cost-effective.

# Pros of Gluco6​

1. **Supports Stable Blood Sugar**

# What Is Gluco6?​

Gluco6 is a natural dietary supplement designed to help regulate blood sugar levels effectively and naturally. Its unique approach centers around supporting something called **GLUT-4 receptors**, which play a critical role in how our bodies process and manage glucose.

# What Are GLUT-4 Receptors?​

Think of GLUT-4 receptors as tiny “sugar gates” embedded in your cells. Their primary job is to transport glucose (sugar) from your bloodstream into your cells, where it’s converted into energy. These receptors are crucial for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels and ensuring your body’s energy needs are met.

# The Problem with GLUT-4 Receptors​

Sometimes, these “sugar gates” don’t function as they should. This often happens when we consume too many hidden sugars in common foods like bread, sauces, or snacks. When the GLUT-4 receptors become overwhelmed, they fail to properly process glucose. This can lead to blood sugar spikes (too high) or crashes (too low), leaving you feeling:

* **Tired**
* **Shaky**
* **Dizzy**

# How Gluco6 Helps​

The primary goal of Gluco6 is to improve the function of these sugar gates. By supporting the activity of GLUT-4 receptors, Gluco6 helps your body manage sugar more efficiently, promoting steadier energy levels throughout the day. It’s like giving these “sugar gates” a gentle nudge to ensure they’re working optimally.

# Why It’s a Game-Changer​

For someone like me, who often struggles with post-meal sluggishness and unpredictable energy crashes, the idea of steady, consistent energy all day sounded life-changing. Imagine no longer battling mid-afternoon energy slumps or feeling the need for a nap after every meal. Instead, you could experience:

# Does Gluco6 Really Work?​

When I first came across Gluco6 and its focus on supporting **GLUT-4 receptors**, I found the concept intriguing yet couldn’t shake my skepticism. Like many people managing blood sugar issues, I’ve tried countless supplements that promised results but failed to deliver.

However, the science behind Gluco6—specifically its role in improving **GLUT-4 receptor** function—set it apart. It wasn’t just a vague claim of “balancing blood sugar.” Instead, it addressed one of the key processes in glucose metabolism. That alone made me curious enough to dig deeper and eventually give it a try.

Here’s what I discovered about how Gluco6 works and why it matters.

# What Are GLUT-4 Receptors, and Why Are They Important?​

GLUT-4 receptors are specialized “sugar gates” in your muscle and fat cells. When you eat, your body releases insulin, which acts as a key to unlock these gates, allowing glucose to enter your cells and be converted into energy. This process helps maintain stable blood sugar levels and provides energy to your body.

# The Problem with GLUT-4 Receptors​

Over time, factors like a high-sugar diet, lack of exercise, and aging can impair GLUT-4 receptors. When these gates don’t work properly:

1. **Glucose builds up in the bloodstream**, causing high blood sugar.
2. **Insulin resistance develops**, making it harder for your body to manage glucose effectively.
3. **Energy crashes become frequent**, leaving you tired and sluggish.

For people with prediabetes or diabetes, this malfunctioning process is a core issue.

# The Role of Muscle Fibers in Blood Sugar Control​

Your muscles play a significant role in glucose regulation. Here’s why:

1. **Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers (Type 1):** These are more insulin-sensitive and help absorb glucose efficiently.
2. **Fast-Twitch Muscle Fibers (Type 2):** These are less insulin-sensitive but respond to physical activity.

Studies show that individuals with Type 2 diabetes tend to have fewer slow-twitch fibers and lower GLUT-4 density, which further hinders glucose absorption.

# How Gluco6 Targets GLUT-4 Receptors​

The key to Gluco6’s approach is its focus on enhancing the functionality of GLUT-4 receptors. It uses ingredients like **Sukre, Gymnema, and Chromium** to:

1. **Support GLUT-4 Activation:** By improving how these sugar gates function, glucose is absorbed more effectively, reducing blood sugar spikes.
2. **Enhance Insulin Sensitivity:** Ingredients like Chromium and Cinnamon help your body respond better to insulin, ensuring glucose is transported into cells.
3. **Reduce Cravings and Spikes:** Gymnema works to curb sugar cravings, preventing excess glucose from overwhelming GLUT-4 receptors.

# What Science Says About GLUT-4​

GLUT-4, often referred to as the “sugar gate,” is a key player in glucose regulation. These receptors are responsible for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells, where it’s used for energy. Their proper function is essential for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and preventing insulin resistance.

# The Harvard Study​

Researchers at **Harvard Medical School** made a groundbreaking observation about GLUT-4 receptors:

* When GLUT-4 receptors in mammals malfunctioned, **50% developed diabetes within six months**.
* Conversely, mammals with fully functioning GLUT-4 receptors not only avoided diabetes but also lived **18% longer**.

This underscores just how crucial these tiny “sugar doors” are for metabolic health. When they work efficiently, they prevent glucose buildup in the bloodstream, reducing the risk of diabetes and its complications.

# My Struggles with Blood Sugar​

Like many, I’ve always had a weakness for sweets—cookies, bread, soda, you name it. A few years ago, I began noticing troubling symptoms:

* **Constant fatigue**: Even after a good night’s sleep, I’d feel drained.
* **Mood swings**: Small irritations felt overwhelming.
* **Energy crashes**: A big lunch would leave me craving a nap instead of feeling refreshed.

After a visit to my doctor, I learned that my blood sugar was out of balance. Years of sugary eating had likely overwhelmed my **GLUT-4 receptors**, leaving my cells unresponsive to insulin. The glucose that should have been fueling my energy was instead building up in my bloodstream.

This was a wake-up call for me. I needed to make changes, but I also realized I could use some support. That’s when I came across **Gluco6**.

# How Gluco6 Helps​

Gluco6 is designed to support and improve the function of GLUT-4 receptors. By using natural, science-backed ingredients, it aims to enhance glucose metabolism and reduce insulin resistance.

# Sukre: A Key Ingredient​

* Sukre, a special type of sugar, works differently from regular sugar.
* **How It Helps:** It slows down glucose absorption, reducing the strain on GLUT-4 receptors. Think of it as a gentle “sugar detox” for your body, allowing these overwhelmed receptors to recover and function more effectively.

# Other Ingredients Supporting GLUT-4 Function​

1. **Gymnema:** Known as the “sugar destroyer,” it reduces sugar cravings and supports insulin production.
2. **Chromium:** Improves insulin sensitivity, ensuring glucose is efficiently transported into cells.
3. **Cinnamon:** Enhances glucose metabolism and reduces inflammation, further supporting GLUT-4 function.

# The Role of Gluco6 in My Journey​

After learning how GLUT-4 receptors influence blood sugar control, I felt confident giving Gluco6 a try. Its science-backed approach and focus on restoring receptor function gave me hope that it wasn’t just another supplement with empty promises.

By slowing glucose absorption and enhancing insulin sensitivity, Gluco6 addresses the root causes of blood sugar imbalances. For me, it felt like a practical and effective tool to complement the dietary and lifestyle changes I was already making.

# My Experience with Gluco6​

When I decided to give Gluco6 a try, I wasn’t expecting a miracle. I paired it with healthier eating habits and regular exercise, knowing that no supplement can work in isolation. Over the course of several weeks, here’s what I noticed:

1. **Steadier Energy Levels:** My usual post-meal crashes became less frequent, and I felt more consistent energy throughout the day.
2. **Reduced Cravings:** I found it easier to avoid sugary snacks, thanks to Gymnema’s impact on my cravings.
3. **Improved Focus:** TeaCrine’s ability to provide non-jittery energy helped me stay productive, especially during long workdays.

# Why It Matters​

What stood out about Gluco6 is its science-backed approach. By targeting a specific mechanism—GLUT-4 receptor functionality—it addresses the root of blood sugar imbalances rather than just masking symptoms.

While results vary for everyone, Gluco6 felt like a genuine tool to complement the lifestyle changes I was already making. If you’ve been let down by other supplements, its unique focus on cellular glucose regulation might make it worth considering.

**Bottom Line:** Gluco6 isn’t a magic pill, but it works in tandem with a healthy lifestyle to support balanced blood sugar and energy levels. If you’re open to a supplement that prioritizes the science of glucose metabolism, Gluco6 could be a valuable addition to your routine.

# Gluco6 Side Effects: Is It Safe?​

When I started using Gluco6, safety was my top priority. Even though it’s marketed as a natural supplement, I’ve learned that being informed about potential side effects is essential—after all, ""natural"" doesn’t always mean completely risk-free.

# My Personal Experience​

For me, the transition to using Gluco6 was relatively smooth. During the first couple of days, I noticed mild **stomach discomfort**—nothing severe, just a slight adjustment period as my body got used to the supplement. By the third day, the discomfort was gone, and I didn’t experience any further issues.

# Potential Side Effects to Keep in Mind​

While most users tolerate Gluco6 well, some individuals may experience mild side effects, especially in the initial days of use. Based on my research and user feedback, here are the most common ones:

1. **Digestive Issues**
   * **Symptoms:** Mild nausea, bloating, or stomach upset.
   * **Why It Happens:** This can occur as your body adjusts to the new ingredients, particularly if you’re not used to supplements with cinnamon or chromium.
   * **How to Manage:** Taking Gluco6 with a meal and a full glass of water can help minimize these effects.
2. **Allergic Reactions**
   * **Symptoms:** Itching, rash, or mild swelling (rare).
   * **Why It Happens:** Sensitivity to certain ingredients, such as cinnamon or herbal extracts like Gymnema or bitter melon, might trigger a reaction in some people.
   * **How to Manage:** Always check the ingredient list carefully. If you have known allergies, consult your healthcare provider before use.
3. **Headache or Fatigue**
   * **Symptoms:** Mild headaches or fatigue during the first few days.
   * **Why It Happens:** Adjustments in blood sugar levels as Gluco6 begins to take effect could cause temporary discomfort.

# Why Gluco6 Felt Reassuring to Me​

1. **Quality Manufacturing:** Gluco6 is made in facilities that adhere to **FDA guidelines** and **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)**, ensuring high quality and safety standards. This gave me confidence that the supplement was produced under strict controls.
2. **Natural Ingredients:** The ingredients in Gluco6, like Sukre, TeaCrine, and Gymnema, are plant-based and free from harmful additives or artificial chemicals. Knowing this helped ease my concerns about long-term safety.
3. **Customer Feedback:** Most users report no significant side effects, and those who did experience mild issues noted that they resolved quickly.

# Tips for Safe Use​

1. **Follow the Recommended Dosage:** Stick to the advised one capsule daily unless your healthcare provider suggests otherwise.

* **My Experience:** I didn’t encounter any major issues. My order arrived on time, and the product was as described. While the results weren’t life-changing, I did notice some benefits when combined with a healthier lifestyle.

# Better Business Bureau (BBB)​

Gluco6 is listed with the **Better Business Bureau**, which I checked as part of my due diligence.

* **What I Found:** There are only a couple of complaints on the BBB site, mostly related to customer service. While the limited reviews don’t give a complete picture, they reinforced the importance of sticking to the official website for purchases.

# My Conclusion: Is Gluco6 Legit?​

Based on my experience, **Gluco6 doesn’t feel like a scam.** It’s a legitimate supplement designed to support blood sugar management. Here are my key takeaways:

1. **Realistic Expectations Are Key:** Gluco6 isn’t a miracle cure, and it won’t replace medical treatments or lifestyle changes. However, it can be a helpful addition to a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper healthcare.
2. **Some Improvements:** I experienced steadier energy, reduced cravings, and better overall management of my blood sugar levels. While the results weren’t dramatic, they were noticeable enough to continue using the supplement.
3. **Varied Results:** As with any supplement, results will vary depending on the individual. For those who don’t see the benefits they hoped for, the **60-day money-back guarantee** provides some peace of mind.

# Final Recommendation​

If you’re considering Gluco6:

* **Talk to Your Doctor First:** Especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are on medication.
* **Set Realistic Expectations:** It’s a tool to support your health, not a magic fix.
* **Buy from the Official Website:** To avoid counterfeit products and access the money-back guarantee.

Gluco6 worked for me as part of a broader health plan, and while it may not be for everyone, it’s worth considering if you’re looking for a natural way to support blood sugar management.

# Cons of Gluco6​

1. **Only Available Online**
   * Initially, I found it inconvenient that Gluco6 isn’t available in local stores or on popular online marketplaces.
   * However, ordering through the official website turned out to be simple, and the shipping was faster than expected.
2. **Takes Time to See Effects**
   * This isn’t a quick fix. I started noticing small changes after about two weeks, with more significant benefits appearing after a month.
   * **Patience is key.** Results build over time, especially when paired with a healthy lifestyle.
3. **Higher Cost for a Single Bottle**
   * At $69 for a single bottle, the price can feel steep if you’re on a budget.
   * I opted for the 3-bottle deal, which brought the cost per bottle down and included free shipping and bonuses, making it more cost-effective.

# Pros of Gluco6​

1. **Supports Stable Blood Sugar**

# What Is Gluco6?​

Gluco6 is a natural dietary supplement designed to help regulate blood sugar levels effectively and naturally. Its unique approach centers around supporting something called **GLUT-4 receptors**, which play a critical role in how our bodies process and manage glucose.

# What Are GLUT-4 Receptors?​

Think of GLUT-4 receptors as tiny “sugar gates” embedded in your cells. Their primary job is to transport glucose (sugar) from your bloodstream into your cells, where it’s converted into energy. These receptors are crucial for maintaining balanced blood sugar levels and ensuring your body’s energy needs are met.

# The Problem with GLUT-4 Receptors​

Sometimes, these “sugar gates” don’t function as they should. This often happens when we consume too many hidden sugars in common foods like bread, sauces, or snacks. When the GLUT-4 receptors become overwhelmed, they fail to properly process glucose. This can lead to blood sugar spikes (too high) or crashes (too low), leaving you feeling:

* **Tired**
* **Shaky**
* **Dizzy**

# How Gluco6 Helps​

The primary goal of Gluco6 is to improve the function of these sugar gates. By supporting the activity of GLUT-4 receptors, Gluco6 helps your body manage sugar more efficiently, promoting steadier energy levels throughout the day. It’s like giving these “sugar gates” a gentle nudge to ensure they’re working optimally.

# Why It’s a Game-Changer​

For someone like me, who often struggles with post-meal sluggishness and unpredictable energy crashes, the idea of steady, consistent energy all day sounded life-changing. Imagine no longer battling mid-afternoon energy slumps or feeling the need for a nap after every meal. Instead, you could experience:

* **Balanced blood sugar**

# Does Gluco6 Really Work?​

When I first came across Gluco6 and its focus on supporting **GLUT-4 receptors**, I found the concept intriguing yet couldn’t shake my skepticism. Like many people managing blood sugar issues, I’ve tried countless supplements that promised results but failed to deliver.

However, the science behind Gluco6—specifically its role in improving **GLUT-4 receptor** function—set it apart. It wasn’t just a vague claim of “balancing blood sugar.” Instead, it addressed one of the key processes in glucose metabolism. That alone made me curious enough to dig deeper and eventually give it a try.

Here’s what I discovered about how Gluco6 works and why it matters.

# What Are GLUT-4 Receptors, and Why Are They Important?​

GLUT-4 receptors are specialized “sugar gates” in your muscle and fat cells. When you eat, your body releases insulin, which acts as a key to unlock these gates, allowing glucose to enter your cells and be converted into energy. This process helps maintain stable blood sugar levels and provides energy to your body.

# The Problem with GLUT-4 Receptors​

Over time, factors like a high-sugar diet, lack of exercise, and aging can impair GLUT-4 receptors. When these gates don’t work properly:

1. **Glucose builds up in the bloodstream**, causing high blood sugar.
2. **Insulin resistance develops**, making it harder for your body to manage glucose effectively.
3. **Energy crashes become frequent**, leaving you tired and sluggish.

For people with prediabetes or diabetes, this malfunctioning process is a core issue.

# The Role of Muscle Fibers in Blood Sugar Control​

Your muscles play a significant role in glucose regulation. Here’s why:

1. **Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers (Type 1):** These are more insulin-sensitive and help absorb glucose efficiently.
2. **Fast-Twitch Muscle Fibers (Type 2):** These are less insulin-sensitive but respond to physical activity.

Studies show that individuals with Type 2 diabetes tend to have fewer slow-twitch fibers and lower GLUT-4 density, which further hinders glucose absorption.

# How Gluco6 Targets GLUT-4 Receptors​

The key to Gluco6’s approach is its focus on enhancing the functionality of GLUT-4 receptors. It uses ingredients like **Sukre, Gymnema, and Chromium** to:

1. **Support GLUT-4 Activation:** By improving how these sugar gates function, glucose is absorbed more effectively, reducing blood sugar spikes.
2. **Enhance Insulin Sensitivity:** Ingredients like Chromium and Cinnamon help your body respond better to insulin, ensuring glucose is transported into cells.
3. **Reduce Cravings and Spikes:** Gymnema works to curb sugar cravings, preventing excess glucose from overwhelming GLUT-4 receptors.

# What Science Says About GLUT-4​

GLUT-4, often referred to as the “sugar gate,” is a key player in glucose regulation. These receptors are responsible for transporting glucose from the bloodstream into cells, where it’s used for energy. Their proper function is essential for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels and preventing insulin resistance.

# The Harvard Study​

Researchers at **Harvard Medical School** made a groundbreaking observation about GLUT-4 receptors:

* When GLUT-4 receptors in mammals malfunctioned, **50% developed diabetes within six months**.
* Conversely, mammals with fully functioning GLUT-4 receptors not only avoided diabetes but also lived **18% longer**.

This underscores just how crucial these tiny “sugar doors” are for metabolic health. When they work efficiently, they prevent glucose buildup in the bloodstream, reducing the risk of diabetes and its complications.

# My Struggles with Blood Sugar​

Like many, I’ve always had a weakness for sweets—cookies, bread, soda, you name it. A few years ago, I began noticing troubling symptoms:

* **Constant fatigue**: Even after a good night’s sleep, I’d feel drained.
* **Mood swings**: Small irritations felt overwhelming.
* **Energy crashes**: A big lunch would leave me craving a nap instead of feeling refreshed.

After a visit to my doctor, I learned that my blood sugar was out of balance. Years of sugary eating had likely overwhelmed my **GLUT-4 receptors**, leaving my cells unresponsive to insulin. The glucose that should have been fueling my energy was instead building up in my bloodstream.

This was a wake-up call for me. I needed to make changes, but I also realized I could use some support. That’s when I came across **Gluco6**.

# How Gluco6 Helps​

Gluco6 is designed to support and improve the function of GLUT-4 receptors. By using natural, science-backed ingredients, it aims to enhance glucose metabolism and reduce insulin resistance.

# Sukre: A Key Ingredient​

* Sukre, a special type of sugar, works differently from regular sugar.
* **How It Helps:** It slows down glucose absorption, reducing the strain on GLUT-4 receptors. Think of it as a gentle “sugar detox” for your body, allowing these overwhelmed receptors to recover and function more effectively.

# Other Ingredients Supporting GLUT-4 Function​

1. **Gymnema:** Known as the “sugar destroyer,” it reduces sugar cravings and supports insulin production.
2. **Chromium:** Improves insulin sensitivity, ensuring glucose is efficiently transported into cells.
3. **Cinnamon:** Enhances glucose metabolism and reduces inflammation, further supporting GLUT-4 function.

# The Role of Gluco6 in My Journey​

After learning how GLUT-4 receptors influence blood sugar control, I felt confident giving Gluco6 a try. Its science-backed approach and focus on restoring receptor function gave me hope that it wasn’t just another supplement with empty promises.

By slowing glucose absorption and enhancing insulin sensitivity, Gluco6 addresses the root causes of blood sugar imbalances. For me, it felt like a practical and effective tool to complement the dietary and lifestyle changes I was already making.

# My Experience with Gluco6​

When I decided to give Gluco6 a try, I wasn’t expecting a miracle. I paired it with healthier eating habits and regular exercise, knowing that no supplement can work in isolation. Over the course of several weeks, here’s what I noticed:

1. **Steadier Energy Levels:** My usual post-meal crashes became less frequent, and I felt more consistent energy throughout the day.
2. **Reduced Cravings:** I found it easier to avoid sugary snacks, thanks to Gymnema’s impact on my cravings.
3. **Improved Focus:** TeaCrine’s ability to provide non-jittery energy helped me stay productive, especially during long workdays.

# Why It Matters​

What stood out about Gluco6 is its science-backed approach. By targeting a specific mechanism—GLUT-4 receptor functionality—it addresses the root of blood sugar imbalances rather than just masking symptoms.

While results vary for everyone, Gluco6 felt like a genuine tool to complement the lifestyle changes I was already making. If you’ve been let down by other supplements, its unique focus on cellular glucose regulation might make it worth considering.

**Bottom Line:** Gluco6 isn’t a magic pill, but it works in tandem with a healthy lifestyle to support balanced blood sugar and energy levels. If you’re open to a supplement that prioritizes the science of glucose metabolism, Gluco6 could be a valuable addition to your routine.

# Gluco6 Side Effects: Is It Safe?​

When I started using Gluco6, safety was my top priority. Even though it’s marketed as a natural supplement, I’ve learned that being informed about potential side effects is essential—after all, ""natural"" doesn’t always mean completely risk-free.

# My Personal Experience​

For me, the transition to using Gluco6 was relatively smooth. During the first couple of days, I noticed mild **stomach discomfort**—nothing severe, just a slight adjustment period as my body got used to the supplement. By the third day, the discomfort was gone, and I didn’t experience any further issues.

# Potential Side Effects to Keep in Mind​

While most users tolerate Gluco6 well, some individuals may experience mild side effects, especially in the initial days of use. Based on my research and user feedback, here are the most common ones:

1. **Digestive Issues**
   * **Symptoms:** Mild nausea, bloating, or stomach upset.
   * **Why It Happens:** This can occur as your body adjusts to the new ingredients, particularly if you’re not used to supplements with cinnamon or chromium.
   * **How to Manage:** Taking Gluco6 with a meal and a full glass of water can help minimize these effects.
2. **Allergic Reactions**
   * **Symptoms:** Itching, rash, or mild swelling (rare).
   * **Why It Happens:** Sensitivity to certain ingredients, such as cinnamon or herbal extracts like Gymnema or bitter melon, might trigger a reaction in some people.
   * **How to Manage:** Always check the ingredient list carefully. If you have known allergies, consult your healthcare provider before use.
3. **Headache or Fatigue**
   * **Symptoms:** Mild headaches or fatigue during the first few days.
   * **Why It Happens:** Adjustments in blood sugar levels as Gluco6 begins to take effect could cause temporary discomfort.

# Why Gluco6 Felt Reassuring to Me​

1. **Quality Manufacturing:** Gluco6 is made in facilities that adhere to **FDA guidelines** and **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)**, ensuring high quality and safety standards. This gave me confidence that the supplement was produced under strict controls.
2. **Natural Ingredients:** The ingredients in Gluco6, like Sukre, TeaCrine, and Gymnema, are plant-based and free from harmful additives or artificial chemicals. Knowing this helped ease my concerns about long-term safety.
3. **Customer Feedback:** Most users report no significant side effects, and those who did experience mild issues noted that they resolved quickly.

# Tips for Safe Use​

1. **Follow the Recommended Dosage:** Stick to the advised one capsule daily unless your healthcare provider suggests otherwise.
2. **Take It with Food:** Consuming Gluco6 with a meal can reduce the chances of digestive discomfort.
3. **Consult Your Doctor:** If you’re pregnant, breastfeeding, taking medication, or managing chronic health conditions like diabetes, it’s always best to discuss new supplements with your doctor.
4. **Monitor Your Body:** Pay attention to how you feel after starting Gluco6. If you notice persistent side effects or reactions, stop use and consult a healthcare professional.

Overall, Gluco6 feels safe when used as directed. The few mild side effects reported are manageable and temporary. As with any supplement, individual experiences may vary, so listening to your body and consulting a healthcare provider is essential.

If you’re considering Gluco6, its commitment to quality manufacturing and natural ingredients makes it a solid choice. But as with any new health regimen, it’s always better to err on the side of caution.

# Is Gluco6 a Scam or Legit? My Thoughts​

When I first learned about Gluco6, I couldn’t help but feel skeptical. The supplement market is full of bold claims, and it’s easy to become wary. After all, we’ve all heard of products that don’t live up to their promises. Here’s my honest take on Gluco6 based on my personal experience and the research I’ve done.

# Regulatory Concerns​

One of the first things I looked into was whether Gluco6 made any unrealistic or misleading claims. Regulatory bodies like the **FDA** and **FTC** have strict guidelines for supplements, especially those related to managing chronic conditions like diabetes.

* **What I Found:** Gluco6 doesn’t claim to cure diabetes or other blood sugar disorders. Instead, it positions itself as a supplement designed to **support healthy blood sugar levels** and improve glucose metabolism. This gave me some reassurance, as it aligns with what supplements are supposed to do—complement, not replace, medical treatments.
* **My Approach:** I treated Gluco6 as an **add-on to my existing health plan**. For me, it’s about working alongside my doctor’s recommendations, not using a supplement as a standalone solution.

# Customer Feedback​

Before purchasing, I read online reviews to see what others were saying about Gluco6. As expected, the feedback was mixed.

* **Positive Reviews:** Many users reported improvements in their blood sugar levels, reduced cravings, and steadier energy. Some even mentioned feeling better overall after consistent use.
* **Negative Reviews:** Common complaints were about shipping delays and issues with customer service. A few users didn’t see the results they hoped for, which is understandable since supplements often have varied effects depending on the individual.
* **My Experience:** I didn’t encounter any major issues. My order arrived on time, and the product was as described. While the results weren’t life-changing, I did notice some benefits when combined with a healthier lifestyle.

# Better Business Bureau (BBB)​

Gluco6 is listed with the **Better Business Bureau**, which I checked as part of my due diligence.

* **What I Found:** There are only a couple of complaints on the BBB site, mostly related to customer service. While the limited reviews don’t give a complete picture, they reinforced the importance of sticking to the official website for purchases.

# My Conclusion: Is Gluco6 Legit?​

Based on my experience, **Gluco6 doesn’t feel like a scam.** It’s a legitimate supplement designed to support blood sugar management. Here are my key takeaways:

1. **Realistic Expectations Are Key:** Gluco6 isn’t a miracle cure, and it won’t replace medical treatments or lifestyle changes. However, it can be a helpful addition to a balanced diet, regular exercise, and proper healthcare.
2. **Some Improvements:** I experienced steadier energy, reduced cravings, and better overall management of my blood sugar levels. While the results weren’t dramatic, they were noticeable enough to continue using the supplement.
3. **Varied Results:** As with any supplement, results will vary depending on the individual. For those who don’t see the benefits they hoped for, the **60-day money-back guarantee** provides some peace of mind.

# Final Recommendation​

If you’re considering Gluco6:

* **Talk to Your Doctor First:** Especially if you have pre-existing conditions or are on medication.
* **Set Realistic Expectations:** It’s a tool to support your health, not a magic fix.
* **Buy from the Official Website:** To avoid counterfeit products and access the money-back guarantee.

Gluco6 worked for me as part of a broader health plan, and while it may not be for everyone, it’s worth considering if you’re looking for a natural way to support blood sugar management.

# Cons of Gluco6​

1. **Only Available Online**
   * Initially, I found it inconvenient that Gluco6 isn’t available in local stores or on popular online marketplaces.
   * However, ordering through the official website turned out to be simple, and the shipping was faster than expected.
2. **Takes Time to See Effects**
   * This isn’t a quick fix. I started noticing small changes after about two weeks, with more significant benefits appearing after a month.
   * **Patience is key.** Results build over time, especially when paired with a healthy lifestyle.
3. **Higher Cost for a Single Bottle**
   * At $69 for a single bottle, the price can feel steep if you’re on a budget.
   * I opted for the 3-bottle deal, which brought the cost per bottle down and included free shipping and bonuses, making it more cost-effective.

# Pros of Gluco6​

1. **Supports Stable Blood Sugar**
   * One of the most noticeable changes was how steady my energy felt throughout the day.
   * Before Gluco6, I experienced mid-afternoon crashes, but within a few weeks, those became less frequent as my blood sugar felt more balanced.
2. **Reduces Sugar Cravings Naturally**
   * My cravings for sweets—especially after meals—gradually subsided.
   * This wasn’t something I expected, but it made a big difference in avoiding unhealthy snacks and sticking to better food choices.
3. **Boosts GLUT-4 Receptor Function**
   * Knowing that Gluco6 targets **GLUT-4 receptors**, a key mechanism in blood sugar regulation, gave me confidence in its science-backed approach.
   * It’s reassuring to know it works on a deeper level rather than just offering surface-level effects.
4. **Enhances Energy Without Caffeine**
   * I appreciated that Gluco6 doesn’t rely on stimulants like caffeine to boost energy.
   * The natural, steady energy it provided helped me stay focused during long workdays without the jittery feeling or energy crashes I’d get from coffee.
5. **Natural and Non-GMO Ingredients**
   * Knowing that Gluco6 uses natural, non-GMO ingredients was a major plus for me.
   * I’m cautious about what I put into my body, and this transparency made it an easy choice.
6. **Weight Management**
   * While weight loss wasn’t my primary goal, I noticed subtle changes—my clothes started fitting better after about a month.
   * Combined with healthier eating and regular exercise, Gluco6 seemed to support my weight management efforts.
7. **Positive Customer Feedback**
   * Reading success stories from other users reassured me that I wasn’t alone in my struggles with blood sugar.
   * Hearing relatable experiences made me more confident in giving Gluco6 a try.

While Gluco6 has a few drawbacks, such as being online-exclusive and requiring patience for results, its benefits far outweigh the cons. From supporting stable blood sugar to reducing cravings and improving energy naturally, Gluco6 is a solid supplement that fits well into a healthy lifestyle.

If you’re considering it, I recommend starting with the 3-bottle option to save money and give it enough time to show results. Paired with a good diet and exercise, it can be a helpful tool in managing blood sugar and overall well-being.

---

Looking to spend a Monday evening a week chatting with friendly redditors? Hammersmith Hang Out is for you.

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

1ho4mtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/DubaiCentral/comments/1ho4mtw/looking_for_my_partner_in_serious_crime/,Looking for My Partner in (Serious) Crime,"Hi there,

I am a woman in my early 20s and living in Abu Dhabi. I’m at a stage in life where I want to focus on something real and meaningful. I’m looking for someone who values kindness, emotional maturity, and open communication—someone who’s genuinely ready to talk about building a future together.

It’s important to me that we share similar values and that you’re based in either Abu Dhabi or Dubai, as I believe proximity helps nurture a connection. I’m not here for casual conversations or fleeting interactions—I’m looking for someone serious about commitment, and I believe that meaningful connections take time to grow.

When I’m not sipping on matcha, I love cozying up with a good movie or rewatching my favorite anime series. The winters here are chef’s kiss—perfect for long walks and quiet moments. I’m a bit of a coffee enthusiast too, always down to explore new spots for a good brew.

Late 20s preferred, but I’m open to those who are aligned with where I am in life.

If this resonates with you and you’re ready to have honest, purposeful conversations, I’d love to hear from you!

1ho4mdh,https://i.redd.it/2sh05nz11l9e1.jpeg,Our slow bar/pop-up café at home will be open for orders this week or until the holiday ends!,"If ever lang na papasyal kayo sa Cabog-cabog view deck or Tanato River, or kung dadaan kayo sa Maluang Road malapit sa Vista mall, we are inside Bataan Square Garden (straight from the guard house) and you might want to grab a cup of coffee! We're very easy to locate.

We're selling affordable coffee using 100% Arabica from Cerrado Brazil (beans from OriginsMNL) for our espresso based drinks and much more affordable Arabica/Robusta blend for our cold brew/moka pot sa mga gusto lang na magcoffee. We also have non-coffee drinks like Matcha and Chocolate drink! You may also request for a pourover drink using the Gummy Beans blend from The Good Cup Coffee.

1ho4lqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1ho4lqz/where_to_start/,Where to start,"I’m after some advice about where to start with self publishing a coffee-table style book that I’ve written and laid out in Adobe InDesign. It’s not a novel so I want it printed in full colour, edge to edge, as a large format photo book. I want to have a few copies myself and maybe to make it available for others to buy, but don’t expect it to sell loads. But, I guess you never know, so the option to print more using a print on demand service seems to make sense.

I don’t know where to start though. I’m in the UK and have the pdf’s ready to go but who do I go to for printing?? 

What companies offer this service? I’ve looked at various option (KDP, Ingram, Bookvault) but have now got myself a little confused about what I want and which would suit my needs. Does anyone have any recommendations? - essentially I want to print a small number of copies for myself and make it available for others to buy as a way of testing the waters, with the option to sell more if there is a demand.

What do I need to look out for/be aware of when doing this? 

Thanks.

1ho4lly,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1ho4lly/16_years_of_pain_and_ibs_1_hour_of_surgery_4/,16 years of pain and IBS. 1 hour of surgery. 4 grams of Cholestyramine. Relief!,"I had surgery several months ago, and now that things have settled down, I feel like throwing my own (essay length) anecdote into the subreddit pile. TLDR: I was bad, now I'm good. Bile acid sequestrants are a miracle cure.  

**Backstory**:  

The earliest I can remember experiencing the 10 out of 10 gallbladder pain (or what I called a 'flare up') was around 2007. The radiating wave of pain that occurs in your chest, back and sides, makes you shallow breathe, and that no painkiller can do anything about. It happened a few times a year, then a handful, eventually rising in frequency through the years.  

Now you may wonder why I didn't go to an urgent treatment centre the first time it happened, or any time at all in the years since. Well there's two reasons.  

a) I'm dumb and only go to emergency services if I feel like I'm about to die. (i.e - that time I had kidney stones...)   
b) More importantly, this flare up only happened to me at night, it lasted around 4 hours, and then it just went away, leaving me feeling fine afterwards.  

I assumed it was anxiety pain. I figured I must be worried about work the next day, or life in general. I have a history with anxiety and stress, and I know they can manifest in different ways. I just automatically assumed they were the cause. Because I'm an idiot. (to be fair, considering the pain is in the chest and back, I'd never had thought it was the gallbladder, and if it had ever continued into the morning, I'd have made an appointment with a GP)  

**Realising the cause**:   

Last year, I got fed up of living with IBS symptoms for over a decade. One day I'd eat something and be fine. Another day I'd eat the same thing and get the shits. It was driving me nuts, and had impacted my social life. It was the reason I haven't been on a holiday in many years.   

I went to the GP and told them I wanted to see if I was intolerant to anything. Apparently there are no tests for such a thing, instead they put me in touch with a nutritionist who put me on the FODMAP diet. This is where you avoid all FODMAP foods and slowly reintroduce ingredients to see how you react. It's the most miserable diet known to humankind. You can't eat garlic or onion. Fun fact: onion and garlic are in fucking everything! Even ketchup!  

Although this diet lowered the frequency of IBS symptoms for me quite a bit, it didn't eradicate the problem. I was still randomly getting diarrhea, despite eating non-FODMAP foods.  

Anyway, I did the diet for around 3 months, and when it ended I celebrated by going on a 3 day binge of junk food. Five Guys one day, Pizza Hut the next, KFC on day three.  

And then the old familiar flare up came back with a vengeance in the middle of the night. And that my friends, was the first time in 15 years that I asked myself in bewilderment: ""is this pain because of my *diet*? This entire time!?""  

Google told me it was my gallbladder, and specifically the intake of too much fat. So many things in my life made sense, including why the pain would hit me in the evening, i.e - after the biggest meal of the day.  

Anyway, I went to the GP and asked for an ultrasound. Sure enough, there were gallstones in there. I was referred to a consultant at hospital in August 2023. I was asked if I wanted it removed, and after a week of thinking about it, I confirmed I did. My reasoning is that it was better to go through the hassle of surgery now than when I'm older, plus the complications of stones getting stuck are always a risk.  

I was on the waiting list for almost a year, and coincidentally despite switching to a low fat diet the gallbladder started to ache most days which it never had before. Thankfully no 'flare ups' due to my low-fat diet, but the gallbladder started to feel like a foreign object by this point aching every day for no reason.  

I had to keep reminding the hospital that I existed, I'm not sure I'd have had surgery by now otherwise. I only chased them about 4 times during that year-long wait, so it's not like I was being annoying. Please advocate for yourselves everyone, write a formal complaint if you go past your hospital's average wait time. The NHS has a service called PALS which I ended up writing to in desperation, and they speeded things up dramatically.  

**Surgery**:  

Surgery finally happened in July 2024. Because I've had a history with anxiety and hypochondria in the past, you'd assume I'd be nervous, but this was the least nervous I have EVER been in a hospital in my life. Which is a testament to how badly I wanted this gallbladder out of me.  

Everyone there was professional and light-hearted. I asked the anaesthetist if I should expect to wake up with a breathing tube, and he explained how as they lower the anaesthetic level and raise you into consciousness, they time the tube removal just as you're coming awake. But apparently most people have no memory of having the tube taken out, even though technically they're conscious for it.  

I can confirm, I have zero memory of it happening to me. In fact I had no sore throat at all. I don't know if the person who did it was amazing, or if tubes these days are designed better than ever.  

**Recovery**:  

I woke up in mild pain as expected. The worst thing was the nausea though. I puked up twice. Took me a while to feel well enough to be sent to the other recovery ward. I had a cracker and some water there. The nurse was surprised I didn't want tea, coffee or a sandwich, but there was no way I was ready to eat anything by that point.  

When I got home I puked twice again. I'm not sure if it was due to the anaesthetic or the painkiller (morphine?) they gave me while I was in bed. Actually I puked so hard it tore up the stitching on one of my wounds, I put a plaster on it to keep it protected.  

Later that day I started to notice the notorious gas pain that this subreddit had prepared me for. It got a lot worse over the next two days, but I kept walking and drinking water and mint tea to deal with it. It was honestly the worst part of the entire experience.  

I'm kind of laughing in hindsight at everyone who posts in this subreddit worried about surgery. The hospital is the easy part! Nothing can prepare you for the shoulder pain...  

By day 5 I was doing ok though. The wounds looked clean and healing, but the belly button wound in particular was taking its time. It's where they pull the gallbladder out apparently, so I assumed it would take the longest to heal.  

The worst part of recovery was something else...  

**Complication**:  

On day 2 I woke up with a pain in my left leg, followed by numbness, and then random burning pain. After spending 6 hours in the utter insanity that is the NHS A&E, I was told it probably wasn't a DVT blood clot. I realised that there was a shaved patch of skin on my thigh, and after a bit of googling learned that during surgery a diathermy pad is attached to the leg. I contacted the hospital and the doctor confirmed a pad was used, but also said it doesn't cause numbness or pain in any patient he'd ever seen, so I was left to assume I had caused a pinched nerve by myself somehow.  

I do remember the night before the pain was the one I literally couldn't sleep horizontally due to the gas pain, and was propped up with a ton of pillows and cushions, so maybe my shitty posture was to blame. Either way, the numbness and pain slowly faded away after two weeks.  

Protip: be prepared in advance for day 2 and 3 of recovery, you won't be able to sleep lying down, but you also don't want to injure yourself like I did, so think about how to position yourself during those nights.  

**Dealing with IBS**:  

Alas, removing my gallbladder didn't magically cure my IBS symptoms. After keeping a post-surgery food diary for three months I realised diarrhea was relegated to mornings. Basically the first thing I ate after waking up would give me symptoms without fail. But if I ate the exact same thing in the evening I'd be fine.  

After months of trial and error just to be sure I wasn't intolerant to any particular ingredient, I eventually accepted that this was due to bile acid. I didn't have obvious signs like yellow in bowel movements, etc, but otherwise it just made too much sense. Acid accumulates during the night due to no gallbladder, and then eating anything with a meaningful amount of fat would trigger symptoms next morning. I'm pretty sure I've had a variation of this issue for twenty years anyway, due to a poorly gallbladder.  

I tried psyllium husk, probiotics, slippery elm, and digestive enzymes but nothing worked. So I just settled for going to the GP to get a bile binder. They prescribed me Cholestyramine which I took via a 4g sachet of powder in a glass of water every morning. I ate food 30 mins afterwards. This nasty tasting powder finally cured me of IBS!  

Strangely it initially caused a disruptive side effect, where I'd wake up in the middle of the night with a sore and full bladder needing to pee. I went back to the doc for an alternative and he prescribed me Colesevelam tablets. Contrary to pretty much every comment I've seen on reddit, although this was way more convenient than the powder, I found it far less effective, so I switched back to the powder. The side effects did not return thankfully. Anyway, FINALLY, NO MORE IBS SYMPTOMS. I feel like a normal human being! I can eat anything and...nothing bad happens. I almost wanted to cry.  

**Random tips**:  

*  Don't watch anything remotely funny for a week following surgery. Avoid comedies. Trust me.

*  I had my first bowel movement 3 days post surgery. Two days after that I realised the painkillers were probably the reason I wasn't going daily. So every few days I'd not take painkillers in the morning and just wait for a BM before resuming meds.  

* Related to the above, be disciplined with painkillers. I wasn't as I should have been because I'm not a fan of overloading the body with drugs, so I suffered unnecessarily. I would suggest alternating between paracetamol and ibuprofen throughout the day, then lower the dosage as you feel better throughout the first 7 days.  

I was also given a codeine type med, but didn't take it as I thought it was overkill, plus I didn't want the side effects of nausea to deal with. The consulting doctor I talked to a week after surgery said I had made a wise choice, and I assume this is due to the side effects (addiction, constipation, nausea, etc).  

* After a week the wounds started to itch like crazy. That's a good sign meaning they're healing and past the halfway point. To deal with the itchiness I took loratadine, which is my usual go to medication for hayfever, and it calmed them down.  

* After 4 weeks I finally decided to peel off the scabs on my wounds, and felt a bit dumb because underneath the layer the wounds had clearly healed a while ago. Felt oddly satisfying though.  

**Summary**:  

* I don't feel bloated after eating anymore.  
* My allergies seemed to have calmed down? I'll need to test this next spring, but it feels like there's much less sneezing and watery eyes than usual since I had surgery.   
* Obviously no more agonising pain when eating fatty food. I returned to eating normal (and junk) food after 1 week.    
* No more random diarrhea (due to meds).   
* No more feeling like a zombie, sapped of energy all the time.  

My gallbladder had basically ruined my life for almost two decades. Let me reiterate for anyone reading this who is worried about surgery: the hospital is the EASIEST part of the whole thing. You're literally just walking into a building populated by professionals whose sole job is to look after you, so you can have a nap for an hour. That's it. It's actually the gas pain two days later that actually hurts.  

Yes, diarrhea was not a great outcome of the surgery, but in my particular case I'd already suffered a decade of it anyway, and have now found an actual cure that allows me to eat whatever I want. But more important than that, if you've got excruciating gallbladder pain due to gallstones, holding off on surgery is simply going to make your life harder and potentially lead to life-threatening scenarios. I'm glad I went through the hassle of surgery in my 40s rather than later in life.",10,1735388438.0,gallbladders,1,1.0,False

**Prologue**

When the eternal march of Time commenced its relentless stride, and the boundless expanse of Space, a malevolent entity stirred into existence, its voracious appetite consuming all before it, leaving naught but a shard of madness in its inexorable wake. The very fabric of existence quivered in the grip of fear, insanity, and disorder, as ancient eldritch forces made way for the advent of Chaos .

An entity devoid of conscience, remorse, or empathy, a primordial evil that lurks beyond the Vast Void of Nothingness—where all is forged, yet nothing is found, and resides within the very fabric of Space called Abyssal Primordia of Origins.

The ceaseless dance between Time and Space, spiraling inextricably, existed in a state of unsteady equilibrium, their coexistence undulating yet incomplete. Within this natural order, the malevolent force of Chaos emerged, disrupting their fragile balance. It is this disruption that binds them together, bringing about a harmonic convergence. Thus, the trinity of Time, Space, and Chaos formed what mortals perceive as Reality, each element essential to the balance and harmony came to be of existence.

Countless eons passed since the birth of Reality and all of existence therein, lo and behold! The Anomaly approached the threshold of Reality, its arrival heralding a cataclysmic disruption in the cosmic balance. With origins shrouded in mystery, it cast forth ripples that reverberated through the very fabric of existence, unsettling the harmony within Reality itself. Like an ancient Leviathan circling its prey, The Anomaly swept through the Abyssal Primordia of Origins, its casted ripples reached every corner of Space and beyond it, awakening a primordial entity of unfathomable antiquity, its presence unknown to the denizens of Reality but ancient beyond reckoning.

  
  
**Act 1:**

“The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents. We live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity, and it was not meant that we should voyage far. The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”

—H.P Lovecraft



When I first delved into metaphysics at the University of Psychodia, amidst an expedition beyond the Celestium Range's towering peaks, my team and I stumbled upon peculiar otherworldly sigils etched into the walls of an ancient chamber. These sigils, hauntingly unfamiliar, began to invade my dreams; as if demanding comprehension from mortal minds like ours. Each passing day, weeks, and months only deepened the mystery, unearthing something dormant in my memory, a possession not truly mine. These persistent dreams blur the line between reality and imagination, leaving me to question their significance. Who are these people? What connection do they have with me?

Over time, whispers filled the void of silence, urging me toward actions I cannot comprehend—all because of those blasphemous sigils we encountered. Nightfall now brings a sense of dread, as each passing hour draws me closer to sleep and the mysteries it may unravel and the horrors it may bring unto a feeble mortal mind.

June 4, 1907 AD. It has been four months since I began experiencing troubles related to the sigils my team and I discovered in the ancient chamber. The chamber itself is nameless, with no evidence of any life having ever existed there, save for the very sigils within its walls.

Every night, an unknown force looms in every corner of my room, compelling me to succumb to sleep despite my futile resistance. As soon as I close my eyes, I am drawn into The Dream, returning to the nameless chamber within the treacherous peaks of the Celestium Range. In my dream, a presence lurks everywhere, and I feel an inescapable fixation on the sigils engraved within the walls, as if they are calling to me. What mysteries do they hold for a nobody such as I?

It was the midwinter of 1907 when Dr. James P. Winston, an eminent epigraphist and paleographer, arrived at the University of Psychodia. Dr. Winston, renowned for his unparalleled expertise in deciphering ancient scriptures, had once assured me that he would aid in unraveling the mysteries of the sigils within the nameless chamber of the Celestium Range when I told him about the dreams that haunt me. His reputation as a pioneer in the field of epigraphy was well-deserved, his countless feats etched into the annals of scholarly achievement.

  


**Act 2:**

In the midst of July 1907, I found myself seeking assistance. It was during this time that I first encountered Dr. Winston, a colleague, turned out to be a renowned expert in deciphering ancient scriptures. Our meeting took place on a Saturday morning at a quaint local coffee shop.

“Dr. Winston? Hello, I’m Dr. Alexander Bennett, it was a pleasure to finally meet you in person,” I greeted him, extending my hand. “We've previously discussed the troubling dreams that have been plaguing me. I believe you may be able to offer some insight. Can you help me?”

“Yes, we did discuss your dreams. I hope you can further tell me all about the dream you encountered, how it all started?” Dr. Winston reached for my hand and shook it.

“It started when my team of researchers and I ventured to the long-forgotten, treacherous peaks of the Celestium Range. We believed that we would encounter something there that could help us reshape history. Upon reaching the summit, we were greeted by an ancient chamber unknown to history, as if this chamber is to be forgotten as well. Just like the mountain range itself, anyone who ventured there always returned as if their minds had left their heads,” I recounted the story of our journey into the heart of mystery.

“This team of yours, did they show these changes too? When you returned from exploring the mountain, what did you see?” Dr. Winston inquired.

“They seemed normal, in contrast to the horrors I experienced long after exiting  the nameless chamber of the Celestium Range,” I replied. “But that’s what I thought. Weeks after our return, I began to notice strange behavior. They would mutter gibberish to themselves, yet when I tried to engage them, they responded as if nothing had happened.”

“Fascinating, it would seem that not everyone will experience the same right away. Please, do continue.” Dr. Winston requested.

“Exactly one month after our expedition, one by one, my team suddenly stopped going to work. I checked on them during the night of any day I could.” I continued. “All of them seemed normal except for the gibberish they’re muttering when no one else is present. But one of them, Terry, she’s our scripture expert, she… she is nowhere to be found. I… I-I checked on her everywhere, asked everyone who knew her but based on their answer, she seemed to cease to exist. No one remembered her, no one in the office, her friends, even her parents did not know her.” I added.

Dr. Winston was silent, probably processing what I just told him.

“This… woman, Terry, are you sure she existed? She is not just a figment of your imagination?” Dr. Winston asked with uncertainty.

The uncertainty in Dr. Winston's voice mirrored my own doubts. Had Terry truly existed, or was she merely a construct of my troubled mind?

""I'm certain she was real,"" I insisted, though the seed of doubt had already been planted. ""She was an integral part of our team, a brilliant scholar with a keen intellect. It's inconceivable that she could simply vanish without a trace.""

Dr. Winston nodded thoughtfully, his expression grave. ""It seems we have stumbled upon a mystery far more profound than we anticipated. Tell me, Dr. Bennett, do you believe these dreams are somehow connected to Terry's disappearance?""

His words struck a chord within me, resonating with the unsettling feeling that had lingered since my first encounter with the dreams. ""I can't say for certain,"" I admitted, ""but there's something about them, something... otherworldly. Maybe they hold the key to unlocking the truth behind Terry's vanishing and the strange occurrences that have plagued us since our expedition.""

Dr. Winston leaned forward, his eyes alight with curiosity. ""Then it seems our journey has only just begun, Dr. Bennett. But fret not, for I will help you to decipher these sigils you saw and together, we shall delve deeper into the mysteries that shroud the Celestium Range and uncover the secrets hidden within your dreams.""

And with those words, our quest for answers began in earnest, leading us down a path fraught with peril and discovery, where the boundaries between reality and imagination blurred, and the true nature of existence itself was called into question.

  
**Act 3:**

Two weeks after our meeting, we prepared to embark on our journey to the long-forgotten, treacherous peaks of the highest mountain in the Celestium Range, where the nameless chamber awaited. His face marked with elation, Dr. Winston eagerly anticipated the expedition. In stark contrast, I was filled with an all-consuming dread. My face grew pale, my body broke out in a cold sweat, and the trembling of my hands was indescribable. As we drew closer to our destination, my fear quickly escalated. My mind began to play tricks on me, conjuring visions unreal to human eyes. I started to see a phantom figure everywhere I looked. Though I couldn't fully describe it, I could both hear and see its ""presence,"" and each encounter left me more unsettled.

For 4 hours of our journey, the phantom figure’s presence continued to haunt me as we approached the base of the mountain range. It was a shadow at the edge of my vision, a whisper in the wind that sent chills down my spine. Ever present during our hike. After 12 hours of hiking, we can finally see the nameless chamber at a distance. But, during those 12 long hours, the presence never left me. It vanished only when we stood before the chamber's ancient door. I asked Dr. Winston about his feelings, and his response was both alarming and intriguing. He suggested that this might not be just any nameless chamber, as it exuded an aura of profound significance—like a discovery that could redefine history.

The interior of the nameless chamber glowed faintly, illuminating the sigils etched within the walls. Dr. Winston's expression was one of sheer astonishment, a rare sight for someone so versed in ancient scripts. I asked if the sigils were familiar to him, and his response filled me with a deeper sense of dread. Dr. Winston indicated that these sigils were unlike anything known to humankind.

“This is extraordinary,” he whispered, tracing a finger along the etched lines. “These markings… they could rewrite our understanding of history itself. They speak of a time and knowledge far beyond our own.”

As Dr. Winston continued his examination, I felt a cold sweat break out again. The phantom figure seemed to loom closer, its presence more insistent. It was as if the very air around us buzzed with an unseen energy, a prelude to something monumental. And then, as Dr. Winston’s hand hovered over a particularly complex sigil, the room seemed to shift. The walls pulsated with a dim, eerie light, and a low hum resonated through the chamber.

“This chamber,” Dr. Winston said, his voice tinged with excitement and something else—fear, perhaps. “It’s not just a burial site or a repository of knowledge. It’s a threshold.”

“A threshold to what?” I asked, my voice barely a whisper.

“To something beyond our comprehension,” he replied, his eyes wide with a mix of awe and terror.

At that moment, the phantom figure became clearer, more defined. It was a guide, I think, leading us deeper into the mysteries of the nameless chamber. And as I followed its ethereal form, I couldn’t shake the feeling that we were on the brink of a revelation that would change everything.

  
**Act 4:**

The phantom presence left me petrified or is it the faint pulsating glow of the sigils? Only the voice of Dr. Winston snapped me back to reality.

“Dr. Bennett.” “Dr. Bennet.” “Dr. Bennett! Get a hold of yourself!” Dr. Winston said while shaking my shoulders. “Stay alert, the chamber feels… alive,” he added.

Taking a deep breath, I straightened up and nodded to Dr. Winston. The air was thick with an otherworldly tension as we moved inside the nameless chamber, its dark, foreboding aura seeming to pulsate with an ancient malevolence. With each step, my heart raced, anticipation mingling with dread in equal measure. Yet, I could not turn back now, not when the truth lay just beyond these ancient walls.

Once again, I saw the presence’s figure inside the nameless chamber as we swung open a door. And once again, the chill I felt going up my spine left me breathless. We stepped into a room inside the nameless chamber, and there we saw… the sigils, now emanating a stronger pulsating glow as if the moonlight shone upon them.

“This is it, Doctor. The phenomena we experienced that day. The sigils emitted pulsating glow that I suspected was what haunted me and my team. And I have the feeling that they are connected to Terry’s disappearance,” I implied.

Dr. Winston studied the sigils intently, his fingers tracing the intricate patterns etched into the stone. “These markings are unlike anything I’ve encountered before,” he murmured. “They speak of an ancient language, one that predates even the earliest known civilization.”

As we ventured deeper into the chamber, the air grew colder, and the pulsating glow of the sigils intensified even more, now lighting the entirety of the nameless chamber’s interior. My heart pounded in my chest as memories of our last expedition flooded my mind. The sense of foreboding was palpable, as if the walls themselves whispered secrets of the past.

“Do you feel that, Dr. Winston?” I asked, my voice barely above a whisper. “The chamber feels even more alive, as if it is watching us.”

He nodded, his expression grim. “Yes, as if the chamber knew who we were and our intentions.”

Suddenly, a chilling realization hit me. “Dr. Winston, what if Terry never left this place? What if… she’s still here?”

His eyes widened as the implications of my words sank in. “Then, we must find her, Dr. Bennett. If there’s any chance she’s alive, we owe it to her to try.”

With renewed determination, we pressed on, guided by the eerie glow of the sigils. As we turned a corner, we were met with a sight that froze us in our tracks. There, in the dim light, lay Terry’s journal, its pages scattered and torn.

I picked it up, my hands trembling. “This was hers,” I whispered. “She was here.”

Dr. Winston examined the journal, his face paling as he read the last entry. “Dr. Bennett, listen to this: ‘The horrors of chaos have manifested before me, tearing at the fabric of my sanity. I fear I may not survive tonight. If anyone finds this, know that the sigils hold the key to understanding… and perhaps, to escape.’”

The weight of her words hung heavy in the air. We were closer than ever to the truth, but the path ahead was fraught with unimaginable danger. Taking a deep breath, I looked at Dr. Winston. “We have to keep going. For Terry.”

He nodded solemnly.

Together, we delved deeper into the darkness, the faint and sometimes intense glow of the sigils our only guide. The presence I had felt since our arrival grew stronger, more oppressive, as if it was trying to warn us away or lure us further into its grasp. The line between reality and nightmare blurred with each step, but I knew we had to press on. The answers, and perhaps Terry’s fate, lay ahead.

As we moved deeper into the chamber, the pulsating glow of the sigils cast eerie shadows on the walls, creating an unsettling atmosphere. My heart pounded in my chest as memories of our first expedition flooded back. The faces of my team, once vibrant and hopeful, turned twisted in fear and confusion.

""Dr. Winston, over here,"" I called out, my voice barely a whisper.

In a small, dark alcove, partially obscured by shadows, lay what remained of Terry. Her body was unrecognizable, torn apart by forces beyond human comprehension. The sight was a gruesome testament to the horrors that lurked within this chamber.

Dr. Winston gasped, his face paling as he took in the scene. ""My God, what happened to her?""

""Chaos,"" I replied, my voice trembling. ""The sigils... Terry must have gone close to deciphering them, but the journal also told us about the horrors of chaos, something that none of us could have imagined. Terry must have encountered it. Tore her apart, leaving her indistinguishable, but I know it's her. Maybe… chaos was a tangible entity?""

We stood there in silence, the gravity of our discovery sinking in. The chamber seemed to close in around us, the malevolent energy almost tangible.

""We need to document this,"" Dr. Winston said, his voice shaky but determined. ""And we need to get out of here before we suffer the same fate.""

I nodded, taking one last look at Terry's remains before turning away. As we made our way back to the entrance of the chamber, the weight of our discovery pressed heavily on my mind. Terry's fate was a grim reminder of the dangers that awaited us, but it also steeled my resolve. We had to uncover the truth, no matter the cost.

  
**Act 5:**

The discovery of Terry's fate haunted me as we returned to our base camp. That night, I couldn't sleep. The sigils, the chamber, and the malevolent presence all swirled in my mind, refusing to let me rest. Dr. Winston and I spent hours poring over our notes, trying to make sense of what we had seen.

It was during one of these late-night sessions that Dr. Winston stumbled upon a reference in an old manuscript. ""Dr. Bennett, look at this,"" he said, his voice tinged with excitement. ""There's a mention of a library, one that exists outside the bounds of our reality. A paradoxical place that holds the knowledge of all things, hidden away from the eyes of the world.""

""A paradoxical library?"" I asked, leaning in to see the text.

""Yes,"" he replied. ""If this place really does exist, then it could hold the answers we seek. It could explain the sigils, the chamber, and the force that claimed Terry's life.""

The manuscript itself seemed to shimmer, its words shifting on the page as if resisting our scrutiny. The paradox was evident—it was a guide to a place that defied reality, and yet, here it was, leading us to it.

The prospect of such a discovery filled me with a renewed sense of purpose. The journey ahead would be perilous, but the possibility of uncovering the secrets of the paradoxical library was too important to ignore.

""Then that's our next destination,"" I said, determination hardening my voice. ""We'll find this library, and we'll uncover the truth.""

Dr. Winston nodded, his eyes reflecting the same resolve. ""For Terry,"" he said quietly.

""For Terry,"" I agreed.

And with that, we began our preparations for the next leg of our journey, knowing that the answers we sought were within reach, hidden within the paradoxical existence of the library hidden deep within the nameless chamber.

As we prepared to enter the nameless chamber once again the next day, the phantom figure reappeared in front of me out of nowhere as if trying to guide us deeper within the chamber. I decided to follow it, believing it would lead us to the library mentioned in the manuscript.

The phantom figure stops and vanishes into thin air, leaving us at the entrance of a room deep within the nameless chamber. Dr. Winston hurriedly examines the sigils etched into the walls surrounding the room’s entrance. Before we step inside, he turns to me, his face a mixture of astonishment and disbelief.

""I think this is it. The library mentioned in the old manuscript,"" he begins, ""A library that shouldn't exist as no evidence of it in the entire structure of the nameless chamber and yet here it is,""

I nod, feeling a shiver run down my spine. ""When my team and I first ventured here, this library wasn't here. It's as if it appeared out of nowhere.""

Dr. Winston's eyes widened with realization. ""These sigils,"" he says, gesturing to the walls, ""not only predate even the most ancient civilizations, but they are also indecipherable. Terry must have indeed got close to deciphering them. But in contrast, no matter how much I try, I can't make sense of them. Now I wonder how long Terry studied these sigils. Maybe understanding them had pushed Terry to madness.""

His words send a wave of unease through me. The impossibility of the situation is maddening, yet here we stand, on the brink of uncovering a truth that defies all logic and understanding.

We opened the room, and the entirety of the room really does not make sense, its area was much larger than that of any room found in the chamber. We found ourselves in awe to even comprehend the sheer size of the library as we entered. Ancient text that holds the truth behind what we think was true in history, seems to not be entirely true at all.

We reached the end of the library, and as we turned around, we were met with a sight that filled us with an indescribable mix of sheer fear, amusement, and wonder. There, in the center of the room, stood a lectern, and atop it rested a book. No, not just a book—a grimoire, glowing softly, as if illuminated by the light of the moon.

The grimoire was filled with the same sigils we had seen on the walls, and at its center was what appeared to be a transmutation circle, reminiscent of those used in alchemy. The book's appearance was ancient, its pages yellowed with age. Yet, despite its venerable look, the grimoire felt strangely new to the touch, as if imbued with a timeless energy.

Dr. Winston took hold of the grimoire and carefully opened it, his eyes scanning its pages with intense scrutiny. After a moment, he furrowed his brow and handed it to me. ""What could this mean? It's empty,"" he remarked, puzzled by the lack of visible content within the ancient tome.

As the grimoire came into my possession, I felt a strange compulsion to examine it more closely. To my surprise, the pages were not empty at all. Instead, I saw words materialize before my eyes, forming a title that sent a shiver of intrigue down my spine—Omniographia.

""Omniographia,"" I whispered softly, the word resonating in the stillness of the chamber. Dr. Winston's expression shifted, his curiosity piqued. ""How did you...?"" he began to ask, but I could offer no explanation. It seemed that only I could perceive the contents hidden within the pages of the grimoire. “Omniographia. The title is Omniographia. The record of everything?” puzzled, I asked Dr. Winston.

As confusion gripped us, our surroundings began to warp, distort and freeze spacetime. The faint glow of the sigils dimmed, casting the library into an oppressive darkness. ""Dr. Winston!"" I cried out, but he remained frozen, ensnared by the shifting fabric of spacetime that enveloped us.

The distortion spread fast across the room, I did not know how far this distortion of spacetime would cover, but a torrent of visions assailed my senses. The grimoire, Omniographia, pulsed with an otherworldly energy, its pages alive with the essence of relics imbued with unimaginable power. Memories flooded my mind, not my own, but those of seekers who had met their demise in pursuit of the relics. They marched through my consciousness, haunting echoes of lives cut short, some lost in the depths of madness, others perishing in their quest.

Among these memories, one stood out—a figure I did not recognize, yet knew intimately in my mind. They fell at the hands of a keeper, their fate sealed in a reality that bore a chilling resemblance to my own. And then, the truth dawned upon me with chilling clarity—I am the culmination of their struggles, the sole seeker to have succeeded in collecting every relic.

In that moment of revelation, I understood the nature of my existence—a mere anomaly overseen by The Original Keeper, orchestrator of realities and architect of all existence. My presence should have been erased with the remnants of the last reality he fashioned to alleviate his eternal ennui.

  
**Act 6:**

In the wake of the revelation of my existence and the unlocking of the grimoire's secrets, I find myself face to face with an array of relics, some familiar, others entirely foreign. It dawns upon me that these are perhaps the new set of relics destined to be collected by the seeker of this reality. With my memories restored and forbidden knowledge pulsating within me, I focus my attention on the relic of the Keeper of Denouement—the key to the door of the Vast Void of Nothingness. With newfound clarity and control, I am prepared to confront The Great Weaver once more, armed with understanding and purpose.

With resolve coursing through my veins, I wielded the Key of Denouement, unlocking the door that stood as the threshold to the Vast Void of Nothingness. As I stepped through, leaving Dr. Winston frozen amidst the distorted spacetime, I knew it was for the best. With each stride into the unknown, I carried the weight of a thousand revelations, yet a singular purpose drove me forward. For I understood that once I entered the realm beyond, everything would return to its rightful place, and Dr. Winston would be safe from harm.

As I traversed the expanse of the Vast Void of Nothingness, its eerie emptiness enveloped me once more. From the shadows emerged a voice, its timbre echoing with a sense of ancient wisdom. ""No mortal should dare tread within these realms,"" it intoned, ""but you are no mere mortal, are you?"" “There exists but one mortal who has ventured into the Vast Void of Nothingness. Tell me, Dear Reader, why are you here?” The Great Weaver asked. And I answered, “I know who you are, Keeper, show yourself! It seems that you missed my existence the last time you erased reality and recreated everything all over again.”

“I make no mistakes. Your existence in this reality is indeed an anomaly, you are… an abomination”. The Keeper exemplified. “I am no abomination, and…” suddenly, a vision entered my feeble human mind. In the vision, there was a door in the farthest corners of Vast Void of Nothingness and it seemed that even The Keeper had no knowledge of. “A door, a door exists in the farthest corner of the Vast Void of Nothingness.” I intoned to The Keeper. “Impossible. I know every nook and cranny in this realm. There are no doors besides the one you entered with.” The Keeper explained. “Well, you missed one, or perhaps, you are not meant to open it let alone discover the door.” I said in retaliation.

And so, I set out on a journey with The Keeper to the farthest corners of the Vast Void of Nothingness and we did greet by a door, indescribable beyond words, my mind filled with more and more and more questions as I looked upon the door that connects the Vast Void of Nothingness to the mysterious beyond.

  
**Act 7:**

As I fixated upon the enigmatic door linking the Vast Void of Nothingness to the obscure realm beyond, I perceived reverberations pulsating with each ripple, distorting everything they touched. Each ripple bore a peculiar familiarity, unsettling in its essence. The Original Keeper seemed to share my unease, its ethereal figure outlining the dread the reverberations sent unto us.

Turning the door's heavy handle, I braced myself for what lay beyond. As the door swung open, a profound sense of dread washed over me, chilling me to the bone. Before us stood three entities, moving as one body. Their forms were an amalgamation of shifting shadows and pulsating light, their eyes—if they could be called eyes—glowing with an ancient, benevolent intelligence. With the opening of the door, the reverberations ceased, and an eerie silence enveloped us. Something stirred within me, as if a long-forgotten part of myself had returned.

As The Keeper and I stepped into the unknown, a strange phenomenon unfolded. The once-omnipotent figure began to crumble, its essence unraveling in a flurry of distortion. His form twisted and convulsed, fragments of its being disintegrated into the void. In a fleeting moment, The Keeper vanished, leaving behind only remnants that seemed to coalesce around the beings before me.

When the being spoke, its voice sent shivers down my spine. I struggle to describe it, for it resembled a chorus of horrifying voices, each one more chilling than the last. “A mere mortal caused The Anomaly?” To my ears, they are speaking a language unknown to mankind, but despite that, my mind can fully comprehend what they intone. “I may be an anomaly but I did not cause this,” I replied, my voice trembling. I then explained to the beings the story of how I came to be and asked what happened to The Keeper.

In a voice that chilled my very soul, they unveiled the truth. ""When all is lost, from the Vast Void of Nothingness, an empty vessel emerges. The Keeper, in its inscrutable wisdom, turns the wheel of existence, for in the boundless void, the seeds of new realities are sown. Thus, from the abyss, all things find their genesis anew. We are Reality, an intricate weave of Time, Space, and Chaos. Space is the fabric that cradles all that exists. Yet, the perpetual recreation of reality by The Keeper has rendered you an anomaly, and through your existence, the Anomaly has been birthed, a force even beyond our grasp sending ripples of distortion through all realms.""

Amidst the revelation of Reality and the existence of all things, a sound unlike any other erupted—a roar of dread, reverberating from the farthest reaches of the Abyssal Primordia of Origins. The fabric of existence shuddered, and I felt an overwhelming stillness take hold.

Then, the voice of Reality emerged, calm yet laced with an unfamiliar gravity,

""This force is beyond our comprehension. Its presence stirs what should not be stirred. Anomaly, prepare yourself. What approaches will change everything.""

A sudden rip upon Space came to be when a formless entity, unseen by any eye, brushed upon Reality. The fabric of existence itself seemed to shudder as the entity passed through, sending Time and Chaos into a frenzy of disruption. The scene before me defied description, a maelstrom of cosmic destruction as the foundations of Reality crumbled.

When all was said and done, I felt hopeless. But I mustered the courage to finally try to conjure the power of the Anomaly within me. With all my might, I focused on harnessing the power to send ripples of reverberations. Concentrating on the entity, whose entirety remained unseen to any eye, I unleashed a ripple that sent Time and Chaos into utter disruption, causing Space to distort itself. Yet, the entity before us seemed unaffected.

An echoing voice reverberated through the realm of Abyssal Primordia of Origins, shaking the very essence of Space itself. “Those ripples... they have torn the veil of my slumber. I am awakened, summoned by the screams of reality itself. Destruction incarnate, harbinger of oblivion, I rise to devour existence. All that was, is, and will be, shall crumble into the void at my touch.”

I felt something growing within, an entity of no comprehension forcing itself upon me. As it fully engulfed my body, I witnessed Reality crumbling into nothingness. Everything went black and…



As all existence folded in upon itself, Reality dissolved, devoured by the abyss of Oblivion. From the ruins of its annihilation, a new epoch flickered briefly and vanished in the same breath.

In the aftermath, amidst the remnants of the Anomaly, all entities fell before me. For I am Destruction—creator and unmaker, the pulse of creation and the silence that follows. Fiction itself is my domain, the reflection of what I allow to be known. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first thought and the final void. The end is always mine.",1,1735387769.0,theholders,0,1.0,False
