1puyo6m,https://www.papublishing.com/why-creative-messes-spark-better-ideas/,Title,"Why Creative Messes Spark Better Ideas: The Colorful Chaos of Innovation Creative Mess: I still remember that one time my cluttered desk sparked my best project idea yet. Despite advice to tidy up for clarity, my messy workspace somehow seemed to fuel my imagination in ways a neat desk never did. That made me wonder — could creative messes actually be the secret sauce for better ideas? Throw in colors and their psychological effects, and suddenly, a chaotic table becomes a playground for the mind.
The Unlikely Ally: How Messy Desks Foster Creative Thinking

If you were to peek at my desk right now, you’d probably see a whirlwind of color and chaos—sketches piled on top of notebooks, sticky notes with half-formed ideas, and pens scattered like confetti. For years, I tried to tame this creative mess, believing a tidy workspace was the secret to workplace productivity. But over time, I discovered that my cluttered desk was more than just a sign of busyness—it was an unlikely ally in my creative journey.
Personal Chaos, Unexpected Inspiration

I remember one afternoon when a looming deadline had me feeling stuck. My desk was a patchwork of coffee mugs, color charts, and scribbled notes. As I reached for a pen, my hand brushed against an old doodle I’d forgotten about. That accidental discovery sparked a new idea, completely changing the direction of my project. It was a reminder that creative messes aren’t just distractions—they’re fertile ground for spontaneous inspiration.

This isn’t just my experience. Many creative thinkers share stories of their best ideas emerging from the colorful chaos of their workspaces. Messy tables mean busy imaginations, and sometimes, the most unexpected connections are born from the jumble of our everyday tools.
Messiness Signals an Active Imagination

There’s something powerful about a desk that’s alive with activity. When I see scattered sketches and open books, I don’t see disorder—I see evidence of a mind in motion. Messiness signals an active imagination, one that isn’t afraid to break from conventional thinking patterns. In fact, creative thinking often thrives in environments that embrace unpredictability.

When everything is perfectly organized, it’s easy to fall into routines and predictable solutions. But a little chaos invites curiosity. It encourages us to make connections between unrelated ideas, to experiment, and to take risks. As Scott Adams once said:
Creativity is allowing yourself to make mistakes. Art is knowing which ones to keep.

A messy desk is a visual reminder that mistakes and experiments are not only allowed—they’re essential to the creative process.
Science Behind the Mess: Creative Thinking and Workplace Productivity

Research backs up what many of us have felt intuitively: moderate chaos can actually boost creative thinking and workplace productivity. Studies suggest that a cluttered environment encourages divergent thinking—the ability to generate many different ideas in response to a single problem. This kind of thinking is at the heart of innovation.

 	
Messy tables correlate with busy imaginations: When our surroundings are a little unpredictable, our minds become more open to new possibilities.

 	
Freedom from strict order: Creativity thrives when we aren’t boxed in by rigid rules about how things should look or be arranged.

 	
Spontaneous idea generation: The random juxtapositions of objects, notes, and sketches can lead to surprising insights and solutions.


One study even found that people working in slightly messy rooms were more likely to come up with creative uses for everyday objects than those in tidy spaces. The unpredictability of a creative mess seems to nudge our brains into thinking differently, breaking free from the usual patterns.
Embracing the Colorful Chaos of Innovation

When I let go of the pressure to keep everything perfectly in order, I found more freedom to explore, experiment, and innovate. My desk became a canvas, not just for my work, but for my imagination. The colorful chaos that once seemed like a flaw turned out to be a feature—a sign that my mind was busy, my ideas were flowing, and my creativity was alive.

So the next time you find yourself surrounded by a creative mess, remember: that clutter might just be the unlikely ally you need to spark your next big idea.

 
Color Psychology: The Invisible Force Shaping Our Workspaces

Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions. – Pablo Picasso

When I walk into a workspace, the first thing I notice isn’t the furniture or the gadgets—it’s the colors. The walls, the chairs, even the sticky notes scattered across a messy table, all quietly influence how I feel and how I think. This is the invisible force of color psychology at work, shaping our moods, our focus, and even our capacity for innovation.
How Color Psychology Influences Mood and Focus

We often underestimate just how much our surroundings impact us. Yet, research shows that the colors in our environment have a direct effect on our mood influence, focus enhancement, and even employee well-being. Whether I’m brainstorming wild ideas or buckling down for deep work, the colors around me can either energize or drain my creativity.
Blue: The Calm Catalyst for Focus

Blue is my go-to color when I need to clear my mind and get things done. Science backs this up—blue hues are proven to reduce heart rate and eye strain, making them ideal for concentration-heavy tasks. I’ve noticed that a splash of blue in my workspace helps me feel calm and centered, especially during stressful deadlines. It’s no wonder that so many offices use blue to create a sense of mental clarity and reduce stress.

 	
Blue reduces heart rate and eye strain, improving concentration.

 	
Perfect for meeting rooms or quiet zones where focus is key.

 	
Encourages a sense of trust and dependability among teams.


Green: The Innovator’s Oasis

Whenever I’m seeking balance or a fresh perspective, I gravitate toward green. There’s something about this color that feels both grounding and invigorating. Green not only minimizes eye strain—making it easy on the eyes during long work sessions—but also fosters mental clarity and innovative thinking. I find that a touch of green, whether from a plant or a painted wall, helps ideas flow more freely and supports creative problem-solving.

 	
Green fosters mental clarity and innovative thinking.

 	
Supports eye comfort, reducing fatigue during creative work.

 	
Encourages a balanced, harmonious atmosphere for collaboration.


Yellow: The Spark of Optimism and Creativity

Yellow is the color I turn to when I need a burst of energy or a shot of optimism. It’s the color of sticky notes, highlighters, and the first rays of morning sun streaming onto my desk. Yellow stimulates energy and creativity, making it perfect for brainstorming sessions or spaces where big ideas are born. But I’ve learned that too much yellow can be overwhelming, even anxiety-inducing, so I use it sparingly—just enough to inspire without distracting.

 	
Yellow stimulates energy and optimism but excessive use may cause anxiety.

 	
Best for accent walls, creative corners, or collaborative zones.

 	
Encourages enthusiasm and a positive outlook.

Warm Tones: Energizing Colors for Enthusiasm

I’ve also found that warm tones like orange can inject enthusiasm and warmth into a workspace, especially during group brainstorming. These energizing colors are perfect for sparking lively discussions and encouraging participation, but like yellow, they’re most effective in moderation.

Every color tells a story and sets the stage for how we work, think, and feel. By understanding and intentionally applying the principles of color psychology, we can create workspaces that not only look vibrant but also nurture our employee well-being, boost our focus, and unleash our creative potential.

 


Designing Creative Spaces: More Than Just Aesthetics

When I think about the most inspiring offices I’ve worked in, they’re never the ones with spotless desks and bland, white walls. Instead, it’s the creative spaces filled with bursts of color, scattered sketches, and the hum of collaboration that truly spark my imagination. It’s become clear to me that office design is about so much more than just looking good—it’s about creating an environment where ideas can flourish, where people feel energized, and where workplace productivity and employee well-being are woven into the very fabric of the space.

There’s a certain magic that happens when creative messes and color come together. I’ve seen firsthand how a messy table can mean busy imaginations at work. When we allow for a bit of chaos—papers spread out, color swatches everywhere, whiteboards filled with half-formed ideas—we’re actually giving ourselves permission to think freely and take risks. This colorful chaos isn’t just a sign of disorder; it’s a sign of innovation in action.

Modern office design trends are finally catching up to this idea. We’re moving away from the sterile, all-white environments of the past and embracing warmer, muted hues that reflect the unique identity of each company. These colors aren’t just for show—they have a real impact on how we feel and work. For example, warm tones like oranges and yellows can boost positivity and enthusiasm, especially during group brainstorming sessions. I’ve noticed that when our collaborative spaces are filled with vibrant tones, people are more likely to speak up, share ideas, and connect with their teammates. It’s as if the colors themselves are encouraging us to be bolder and more creative.

But it’s not all about bright colors and energy. There’s also a place for neutral, earthy tones in the office. These shades, inspired by nature, are a key part of biophilic design—a trend that brings the calming influence of the outdoors inside. In my experience, these spaces help reduce stress and support deeper concentration, making them perfect for focused work zones or quiet corners where employees can recharge. It’s a beautiful balance: vibrant, collaborative spaces for teamwork and muted, natural areas for solo work and relaxation.

Another thoughtful touch I’ve seen is the use of color coding in office layouts. By assigning different colors to different departments or zones, we make navigation easier and help teams feel a sense of identity and belonging. It’s a simple strategy, but it can transform the way people interact with their workspace—and with each other.

All of these design choices—embracing creative messes, using color intentionally, and creating collaborative spaces—have a direct impact on workplace productivity and employee well-being. When people feel comfortable and inspired by their surroundings, they’re more likely to do their best work. They’re also more likely to feel connected to their company’s culture and to each other. As Steve Jobs once said,
Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

In the end, designing creative spaces is about more than just aesthetics. It’s about understanding how our environment shapes our mood, our interactions, and our ability to innovate. By embracing a little bit of mess, infusing our offices with color, and creating spaces that invite collaboration and focus, we’re not just making our workplaces look better—we’re making them work better for everyone. The next time you see a messy table or a splash of unexpected color in your office, remember: this is where the magic of innovation begins.

TL;DR: Messy creative spaces combined with thoughtful use of color in office design can boost focus, creativity, and mood, enhancing overall workplace productivity and employee well-being. https://www.papublishing.com/why-creative-messes-spark-better-ideas/",1,1766614314.0,business_small_big,0,1.0,False

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

I saw them again and again on summer nights, on rainy evenings, when we could see the amber reflection on the power lines, the pavement, the bridges, the puddles. The most impressive thing was in the morning, at dawn, when it was like an orange mist over the city, observed with our eyes half-open, half-closed. These memories often come back to me, especially in the morning at dawn when I press the button on the coffee maker.  This simple gesture takes me back to my childhood, to pure innocence and all the sweetness of life in the 70s, far from the hustle and bustle, industrialization, and excitement of today.

Pt3 2/2","Lily exhaled through her nose and tightened her coat around herself. “Did you ever listen to those narrators on YouTube? The scary story guys?”

“Yeah,” I said. “There was one—JuJu. I used to listen to him after missions. Back when I was still with The Division.”

She glanced at the dead town outside. “Why?”

“This place belongs in one of those stories he narrates.”

“You’re definitely paranoid after the motel,” she said.

“Oh? And the mighty Kane isn’t a little worried?”

I didn’t answer.

Because she was right.

I killed the engine. The silence hit immediately.

No hum of electricity. No buzzing neon. No distant traffic.

Just a thin whistle of wind moving through broken windows and hollow doorways.

Lily tapped her fingers against her thigh, restless. “You think he’s still here?”

I reached for my knife, sliding it into its sheath, then grabbed the handgun from the glovebox. “Let’s find out.”

She gave me a look. “I hate this plan already.”

“Good,” I said, pushing the door open. “Means we’re on the right track.”

“Or walking into a meat grinder,” she muttered, following me out.

The air was wrong.

Oregon should’ve been damp, heavy with rain and moss. Here, the ground was cracked and pale. The trees were bare and gray.

Not burned.

Drained.

Lily nudged a dead leaf with her boot. It crumbled into dust on contact.

She grimaced. “Yeah. Totally normal.”

I scanned the main street, weighing options. The bar first.

A deer carcass hung half-slumped over the doorway, stiff and gray. The eyes were sunken, fur dull.

No smell.

No insects.

It should’ve been rotting. It wasn’t.

Something had emptied it out and left it as a message.

We stepped past it.

Inside, the bar was intact.

Too intact.

No dust on the counter. No mold on the walls. No cobwebs. Like someone had pressed pause in the middle of closing time and walked away.

Stools lined up. Glasses on the counter. Some of them filled with a dark liquid that definitely wasn’t beer.

I moved behind the bar, boots quiet on the warped floorboards. Lily stayed a few feet back, gun already out, eyes scanning.

“This feels like we just broke into a crime scene,” she muttered.

She wasn’t wrong.

The liquor bottles were untouched. The cash register sat half open. A few faded bills fluttered in a weak draft.

Then I saw it.

Carved into the wood behind the bar, deep and deliberate:

LEAVE.

Lily spotted it. “That’s cute,” she said softly.

There was more, scratched lower into the paneling, messier. Like whoever had written it had been in a hurry. Or hurt.

IT COMES AT NIGHT.

A cold ripple worked its way down my spine.

“Yeah,” Lily said quietly. “I’m voting we don’t find out what ‘it’ is.”

“Too late,” I said. “We’re already here.”

We left the bar.

The diner across the street was the same kind of wrong. Tables still set. Plates with half-eaten meals that hadn’t molded. Coffee cups with dark rings dried solid but no smell, no flies.

A radio sat on the counter, dial cracked.

Nothing but static.

The general store was different.

There were signs of panic here. Aisles knocked over. Shelves emptied in streaks instead of rows. A dark, dried smear dragged across the floor toward the exit.

At the back, past the shattered freezers, there was a single handprint on the wall.

Too big to be human.

Pressed into the wood so hard the grain had splintered under the force.

Lily stared at it. “Jesus.”

I reached toward it.

The air crackled.

Not my imagination. Static rolled through the room, sharp and sudden, like standing under a power line.

It wasn’t coming from the radio.

It was coming from outside.

We froze.

The hum grew louder. A low, warbling vibration that crawled along the floor and into my bones.

It was coming from the diner.

“You heard that?” Lily whispered.

“Yeah.”

I grabbed her wrist and pulled her with me. “Back to the truck. Now.”

We made it five steps out into the street before the light changed.

The truck’s headlights dimmed.

Not flickered.

Dimmed, like something was drinking them.

The beams faded from bright white to tired yellow, then to a dull glow that barely touched the road.

“Yeah, I really don’t like that,” Lily said.

Shapes shifted behind the diner windows.

Just barely. Just enough to register as movement.

The glass was too dark, the reflections wrong. No outlines, no faces—just something moving on the other side of the black.

The hum rose.

“What the hell is this place?” Lily whispered.

“I think,” I said quietly, “it’s where The Division lost more than a soldier.”

The sound hit first.

Not a growl. Not a roar.

A wet, ragged rasp, like someone trying to breathe through torn lungs.

It came from above.

We looked up as something moved along the rooftop of the building across from us—a warped, crawling silhouette against the dim sky.

The humming cut out like a cable had been yanked.

The air went still.

Then it dropped.

It hit the street hard enough to crack the pavement. Dust and dead leaves burst outward as it landed between us and the general store.

I knew what I was looking at before my brain could finish processing it.

Subject 17X.

The missing Revenant.

He was taller than me—seven feet at least. His skin looked like dried leather pulled over a frame that had grown the wrong way, gray and brittle, flaking in places like burnt paper. Beneath the surface, something darker twitched and pulsed, as if another body was trying to live under his.

Bone jutted from his arms and shoulders in jagged plates, grown into armor. One arm ended not in a hand but a fused, spade-like blade of bone and meat that looked built to cut through metal.

His face was the worst part.

There wasn’t one.

No nose, no lips. Just a raw, stripped surface of muscle and tissue. Two empty sockets where eyes should have been.

Black vapor rose slowly from them, curling into the air like smoke off cooling coals.

Lily stumbled back, gun snapping up. “Jesus Christ.”

I stepped in front of her. “Don’t shoot.”

Not yet.

He walked toward us, slow, joints popping with each step—not from pain, but from pressure. Like his body was always on the edge of coming apart.

He stopped.

Tilted his head.

When he spoke, his voice sounded like it had been stitched together from several people—all of them broken.

“You reek of them.”

My hands flexed on the gun. “The Division is done with me.”

“Are they?” he asked. He dragged the bladed arm across the asphalt. Sparks hissed up. “Do they still whisper in your ear when you sleep?”

“Not anymore.”

He let out a sound like a laugh with no breath behind it. “Then prove it.”

He lunged.

He was faster than me.

The bladed arm came down like an axe. I got my forearms up just in time.

The impact rattled straight through bone. It drove me backwards into the truck.

Metal crumpled. The windshield spiderwebbed and exploded behind my shoulders.

I bounced off the hood and hit the ground in a roll.

He was on me before I could fully stand.

His other hand—long, clawed fingers that moved like they were on strings—clamped around my throat and lifted me like I weighed nothing.

“Still soft,” he growled. “Still theirs.”

I grabbed his wrist with both hands, planted a boot against his chest, and pushed.

The strain lit my muscles on fire. Something in my back screamed.

Then something in his arm snapped.

Bone cracked in his elbow joint with a sharp pop.

He shrieked, a pitch-shifted, warbling scream that sounded like a hundred broken radios going off at once.

He dropped me.

I hit the ground, rolled, and slammed an elbow into his side.

Something inside him crunched.

It didn’t feel like ribs.

It felt like hitting a bag of teeth.

He answered by driving his clawed hand into my side.

Not slicing.

Digging.

His fingers went in deeper than they should, like the space inside my body was wider than it was supposed to be.

It felt like he was trying to pull something out.

Pain roared through me, white and blinding. My vision went spotty.

I swung wild and hammered my fist into the side of his head.

Once.

Twice.

On the third hit, his jaw dislocated and swung crooked, hanging from a strip of tendon.

He just laughed.

His head lolled. A long, dry tongue unrolled from his ruined mouth.

“You’re breaking,” he whispered. “You don’t even know it.”

I grit my teeth, grabbed the base of his throat, and squeezed.

Something popped.

He staggered, and I drove us both backward.

We crashed through the front of the diner. Rotting wood and glass exploded around us. Tables went flying.

Dust and old air rolled over us in a choking wave.

He hit the floor and slid.

I hit the tiles on my knees, ribs screaming.

He got up first.

His body shook, then straightened as if someone else was pulling the strings. Broken bones slid back into place with a chain of cracking noises. Flesh stretched over wounds and knotted shut.

Too fast.

Faster than mine ever had.

He stepped out of the debris, black steam still seeping from his sockets.

No limp.

No hesitation.

He was built for this.

So was I.

I wiped the blood from my mouth and forced my breathing to steady.

Outside, wind howled through the empty town.

Or maybe it was just the sound of us.

He didn’t rush me this time.

He walked toward me, slow and deliberate, as if he had all the time in the world.

“You’re wondering why you’re bleeding,” he said. “Why your bones crack when mine don’t.”

I said nothing.

“Why it feels like you’re breaking apart. Like your body is too small now.” His head tilted. “They didn’t tell you what you really are, did they?”

I moved first.

I barreled into him and drove him out through the other side of the diner.

We burst through the half-collapsed wall and hit the street again, rolling over broken concrete and glass.

He caught me mid-move and slammed me into the hood of a rusted truck.

The metal caved like thin foil. My spine lit up. Something in my shoulder dislocated with a hot, snapping jolt.

His voice was right in my ear. “You still think being human is going to save you.”

I threw my head back.

My skull cracked into his face.

Something broke.

Black steam sprayed over my neck and cheek, cold as dry ice.

He loosened his grip just enough for me to twist, grab my knife, and rip it across his chest.

The blade tore through flesh and bone.

A thick, dark fluid spilled out, hissing where it hit the ground.

He looked down at the wound.

Then laughed.

“Good,” he hissed. “That’s what they wanted to see.”

“Who?” I rasped.

He lifted his head. “The ones waking up. The ones older than The Division. Older than the monsters they send you to kill.”

My breathing turned sharp.

“Who?” I asked again.

“A cult,” he said. “A nest of meat and faith wrapped around something that isn’t either. They write their prayers in blood and speak them through stolen teeth.”

“What do they want with me?”

His grin stretched wider, tearing new cracks in his ruined face.

“They think you’re His vessel,” he said. “Or maybe just His sword.”

Something inside me shifted.

The pain in my side flared—

Then vanished.

My shoulder snapped back into place on its own with a dull, grinding pop. Torn muscle knotted together. Skin crawled over the injury, tightening.

Too fast.

Too eager.

My veins burned. I looked down and saw them pulsing dark beneath my skin, twitching like something was moving inside them.

The healing wasn’t just fixing me.

It was changing me.

The air sharpened. Every sound came into focus at once—the tap of rain on metal, the wheeze of Lily’s breath a ways behind me, the slow drip of Revenant blood onto the dirt.

He watched me, attentive. Almost proud.

“There it is,” he said. “You feel it now, don’t you? In your head. In your bones.”

“What is it?” I asked.

“The real experiment,” he said. “The one they never wrote down.”

“You’re lying.”

He stepped in, sudden and fast. “Then stop it.”

I tried.

I wanted to slow my breathing. I wanted to tamp down the surge running through my muscles, the way everything felt too light, too fragile in my hands.

I couldn’t.

The power kept climbing, like a dial turning higher without my permission.

He lunged.

And this time, I met him halfway.

We collided like two cars going head-on.

The pavement buckled under us, cracks spiderwebbing outward. The nearest building groaned, loose glass rattling in its frames.

I drove my fist into his ribs.

Bone shattered. His torso dented in.

He dragged that bladed arm across my shoulder as I closed, carving a deep line of fire and sparks.

I didn’t scream.

I roared and slammed him backward into the rusted truck. The frame crumpled around him like paper.

We tore through the other side together and hit the ground again, skidding across gravel and broken asphalt.

He kicked me away, tried to stand—his movements glitching for a second like a bad recording.

Something inside him pulsed. Dark light flickered under his skin, branching through him like roots.

We were both bleeding. Both broken.

Both refusing to stay down.

I pushed to my feet, knife back in hand. My breathing was steady now. Too steady.

“You can’t win,” I said.

He grinned through the damage, jaw hanging crooked. Black ichor leaked from between cracked teeth. “I don’t have to.”

He staggered closer, every step leaving faint scorch marks on the ground. “You just had to see it. What you really are.”

“That’s not who I am,” I said.

His voice dropped lower. Almost gentle.

“It will be.”

He lunged again.

This time, he was slower.

I sidestepped, caught his arm, and drove my knee into the side of his head.

Once.

Twice.

On the third hit, he dropped to one knee.

I didn’t stop.

I hammered my fist into the back of his skull, grabbed him by the spine, and slammed him face-first into the broken pavement.

The ground cracked.

He twitched, tried to rise again, but his limbs weren’t listening to him.

He was done.

Barely holding together.

I stood over him, chest heaving, blood cooling on my skin.

His body shuddered, smoke still curling from his empty sockets.

He looked up at me.

No fear.

Just a strange calm.

“You’re not my enemy,” I said, voice rough. “Not really.”

He gave a broken facsimile of a smile. “Then what am I?”

I raised the knife.

Held it over his chest.

He didn’t move.

“End me, 18C,” he whispered. “Do what they built you to do.”

Every instinct I had screamed to finish it.

He was dangerous. Unstable. Full of knowledge I didn’t have. Full of whatever was still twisting through his veins.

He was what I might become if I stepped off the edge and never came back.

And under all that, buried deep, I remembered the first time I woke up in a lab with no name and a number burned into my skin.

I remembered what it felt like to be a mistake they didn’t expect to survive.

I lowered the knife.

“No.”

His breath rattled. Smoke trailed from his eyes in thin threads.

“You’ll regret that,” he said softly.

“Maybe,” I answered. “But not today.”

My knees almost gave out when I stood. The healing was slowing. The adrenaline was burning off, leaving a heavy crash behind.

Lily ran up beside me, skidding to a stop. “Kane—what the hell just happened?”

I didn’t answer right away.

Subject 17X lay on the ground, chest rising shallowly, staring up at the sky like he was waiting for something only he could see.

“I made a choice,” I said.

She looked from me to him. “Is he dead?”

“No,” I said. “Just broken. Like the rest of us.”

She swallowed. “What now?”

I looked toward the dark road leading out of town. The air tasted thinner.

“A cult,” I said. “An old god. Whatever they think is waking up inside me… they’re already moving toward it.”

Lily went a shade paler. “So we go find them?”

I shook my head. “We won’t have to.”

I looked back at 17X.

“We won’t be the ones doing the hunting for long.”

The sky above the dead town was bruised purple, the last light sinking behind jagged hills. The wind pushed through the empty buildings, carrying dust and nothing else.

I stood over 17X, knife loose at my side, ribs aching with each breath.

He stared back up at me, black vapor still leaking in thin streams from his sockets.

I thought about what Carter had said.

They’re waking up.

I thought about the motel.

The thing in the lab.

The mimic at the diner.

The fact none of them were working together—and yet all of them were circling me like they’d been given the same order.

I looked down at the ruined man The Division left here to rot.

“Walk with me,” I said.

His expression didn’t change at first.

Then, slowly, a real smile cracked through the damage.

“You still think this ends with sides,” he rasped. “Like there’s a war you can win.”

“There is,” I said. “Or there will be. And I’m not letting them pick the battlefield without me.”

Something flickered across his face. Regret. Recognition. Maybe both.

“Everything they did to us,” he murmured. “They won’t stop until we tear each other apart.”

“We didn’t,” I said.

His smile twitched. “No. We didn’t.”

I held out my hand.

He stared at it.

Stared at me.

Then he laughed—a dry, broken sound that still somehow sounded more human than anything else he’d said.

“You’re already too late,” he said. “But I’ll walk beside you for a while. Until the stars burn out or the world does.”

His hand was cold and rough when he took mine.

I pulled him to his feet.

We stood there in the dead street, side by side—one failed experiment and one success, both full of something neither of us understood.

For the first time since I’d escaped The Division, I wasn’t just running from something.

I was walking toward it.

Whatever was waking up out there was coming for me.

And now?

Pt3 2/2","Lily exhaled through her nose and tightened her coat around herself. “Did you ever listen to those narrators on YouTube? The scary story guys?”

“Yeah,” I said. “There was one—Zak. I used to listen to him after missions. Back when I was still with The Division.”

She glanced at the dead town outside. “Why?”

“This place belongs in one of those stories he narrates.”

“You’re definitely paranoid after the motel,” she said.

“Oh? And the mighty Kane isn’t a little worried?”

I didn’t answer.

Because she was right.

I killed the engine. The silence hit immediately.

No hum of electricity. No buzzing neon. No distant traffic.

Just a thin whistle of wind moving through broken windows and hollow doorways.

Lily tapped her fingers against her thigh, restless. “You think he’s still here?”

I reached for my knife, sliding it into its sheath, then grabbed the handgun from the glovebox. “Let’s find out.”

She gave me a look. “I hate this plan already.”

“Good,” I said, pushing the door open. “Means we’re on the right track.”

“Or walking into a meat grinder,” she muttered, following me out.

The air was wrong.

Oregon should’ve been damp, heavy with rain and moss. Here, the ground was cracked and pale. The trees were bare and gray.

Not burned.

Drained.

Lily nudged a dead leaf with her boot. It crumbled into dust on contact.

She grimaced. “Yeah. Totally normal.”

I scanned the main street, weighing options. The bar first.

A deer carcass hung half-slumped over the doorway, stiff and gray. The eyes were sunken, fur dull.

No smell.

No insects.

It should’ve been rotting. It wasn’t.

Something had emptied it out and left it as a message.

We stepped past it.

Inside, the bar was intact.

Too intact.

No dust on the counter. No mold on the walls. No cobwebs. Like someone had pressed pause in the middle of closing time and walked away.

Stools lined up. Glasses on the counter. Some of them filled with a dark liquid that definitely wasn’t beer.

I moved behind the bar, boots quiet on the warped floorboards. Lily stayed a few feet back, gun already out, eyes scanning.

“This feels like we just broke into a crime scene,” she muttered.

She wasn’t wrong.

The liquor bottles were untouched. The cash register sat half open. A few faded bills fluttered in a weak draft.

Then I saw it.

Carved into the wood behind the bar, deep and deliberate:

LEAVE.

Lily spotted it. “That’s cute,” she said softly.

There was more, scratched lower into the paneling, messier. Like whoever had written it had been in a hurry. Or hurt.

IT COMES AT NIGHT.

A cold ripple worked its way down my spine.

“Yeah,” Lily said quietly. “I’m voting we don’t find out what ‘it’ is.”

“Too late,” I said. “We’re already here.”

We left the bar.

The diner across the street was the same kind of wrong. Tables still set. Plates with half-eaten meals that hadn’t molded. Coffee cups with dark rings dried solid but no smell, no flies.

A radio sat on the counter, dial cracked.

Nothing but static.

The general store was different.

There were signs of panic here. Aisles knocked over. Shelves emptied in streaks instead of rows. A dark, dried smear dragged across the floor toward the exit.

At the back, past the shattered freezers, there was a single handprint on the wall.

Too big to be human.

Pressed into the wood so hard the grain had splintered under the force.

Lily stared at it. “Jesus.”

I reached toward it.

The air crackled.

Not my imagination. Static rolled through the room, sharp and sudden, like standing under a power line.

It wasn’t coming from the radio.

It was coming from outside.

We froze.

The hum grew louder. A low, warbling vibration that crawled along the floor and into my bones.

It was coming from the diner.

“You heard that?” Lily whispered.

“Yeah.”

I grabbed her wrist and pulled her with me. “Back to the truck. Now.”

We made it five steps out into the street before the light changed.

The truck’s headlights dimmed.

Not flickered.

Dimmed, like something was drinking them.

The beams faded from bright white to tired yellow, then to a dull glow that barely touched the road.

“Yeah, I really don’t like that,” Lily said.

Shapes shifted behind the diner windows.

Just barely. Just enough to register as movement.

The glass was too dark, the reflections wrong. No outlines, no faces—just something moving on the other side of the black.

The hum rose.

“What the hell is this place?” Lily whispered.

“I think,” I said quietly, “it’s where The Division lost more than a soldier.”

The sound hit first.

Not a growl. Not a roar.

A wet, ragged rasp, like someone trying to breathe through torn lungs.

It came from above.

We looked up as something moved along the rooftop of the building across from us—a warped, crawling silhouette against the dim sky.

The humming cut out like a cable had been yanked.

The air went still.

Then it dropped.

It hit the street hard enough to crack the pavement. Dust and dead leaves burst outward as it landed between us and the general store.

I knew what I was looking at before my brain could finish processing it.

Subject 17X.

The missing Revenant.

He was taller than me—seven feet at least. His skin looked like dried leather pulled over a frame that had grown the wrong way, gray and brittle, flaking in places like burnt paper. Beneath the surface, something darker twitched and pulsed, as if another body was trying to live under his.

Bone jutted from his arms and shoulders in jagged plates, grown into armor. One arm ended not in a hand but a fused, spade-like blade of bone and meat that looked built to cut through metal.

His face was the worst part.

There wasn’t one.

No nose, no lips. Just a raw, stripped surface of muscle and tissue. Two empty sockets where eyes should have been.

Black vapor rose slowly from them, curling into the air like smoke off cooling coals.

Lily stumbled back, gun snapping up. “Jesus Christ.”

I stepped in front of her. “Don’t shoot.”

Not yet.

He walked toward us, slow, joints popping with each step—not from pain, but from pressure. Like his body was always on the edge of coming apart.

He stopped.

Tilted his head.

When he spoke, his voice sounded like it had been stitched together from several people—all of them broken.

“You reek of them.”

My hands flexed on the gun. “The Division is done with me.”

“Are they?” he asked. He dragged the bladed arm across the asphalt. Sparks hissed up. “Do they still whisper in your ear when you sleep?”

“Not anymore.”

He let out a sound like a laugh with no breath behind it. “Then prove it.”

He lunged.

He was faster than me.

The bladed arm came down like an axe. I got my forearms up just in time.

The impact rattled straight through bone. It drove me backwards into the truck.

Metal crumpled. The windshield spiderwebbed and exploded behind my shoulders.

I bounced off the hood and hit the ground in a roll.

“Still soft,” he growled. “Still theirs.”

I grabbed his wrist with both hands, planted a boot against his chest, and pushed.

The strain lit my muscles on fire. Something in my back screamed.

Then something in his arm snapped.

Bone cracked in his elbow joint with a sharp pop.

He shrieked, a pitch-shifted, warbling scream that sounded like a hundred broken radios going off at once.

I was walking toward it.

She hearts texts but doesn’t reply.,"For context, I met someone through bumble and she had her insta on her profile. I took my shot and texted her on insta introducing myself and trying to be really polite to not overwhelm her. We chatted a little bit back and forth, nothing crazy but I would send something and she would like the messages but it would take a bit to get a response if she responded at all. After about a week of talking and doing this dance back and forth with the liking and slow responses I asked her if she wanted to meet for coffee and she said sure. Now I’m super excited to go and meet up with her and I’ve been trying to set up a date for the past week but it’s been very slow going. I know it’s odd I messaged her out of the blue and I’m taking it as slow as I can go and she even complimented me saying I was “oddly well adjusted” and that the other people she met on insta “were insane”. I texted again today just trying to slowly continue to set something up but she only liked the message again. I don’t want to be too pushy but I’m stuck in this pattern of only messaging like once a day and getting no where. I’m being respectful and not rushing anything but I really wanna set up this date. Any advice or reassurances people can give me? I’m new to dating and I’m flying by the seat of my pants. Thanks",1,1766613138.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

•	MFs + direct stocks: \~20cr

•	NPS + PF: \~4cr

•	Rental property 1: \~3cr market value

•	Rental property 2: \~10cr market value

•	Primary home: \~15cr market value

Zero debt, clean slate. All self made, with no inheritance to fall back on. 

Take home pay’s way down month on month, but cashflow’s solid. should match my old salary by year-end. No skimping on life either. still jetting off on trips, traveling when we want, dropping cash on the random splurges that make it fun. Investing in a curated wardrobe with fewer pieces but quality ones, a coffee machine with the bells and whistles etc etc. hoping to upgrade own of my cars next year. 

Looking ahead to 2026, wanna lock in this new setup, dial up the fitness game (had a bit of a health wake up call a few months ago) and pour more time (and money) into cool experiences with the family.

I’m 26F and I still show up for holidays and the occasional Sunday mostly to keep the peace with my mom. I don’t even hate church, I just… I’ve been keeping some distance because I’m tired of being the “project” everyone needs to fix. I’ve been dating my boyfriend (27M) for almost two years, we live separately, and he’s not religious. He’s kind, steady, not perfect but safe. Which is probably why my family acts like he’s a demon in a hoodie.

Last weekend my aunt invited me to a women’s group thing at church, said it would be “nice fellowship” and “no pressure.” I went because my mom looked so hopeful and I thought okay, an hour, I’ll drink bad coffee and go home. It was fine at first. Then they asked everyone to share “what you’re struggling with.” I said something bland like I’ve been feeling stressed and disconnected lately. Big mistake. One lady I barely know asked if I was “living in sin.” I tried to laugh it off and said I’m dating someone and I’m happy, that’s all. Suddenly it turned into this whole thing where they started asking me questions like I was on trial. Do you submit. Does he lead. Are you honoring your father and mother. Do you dress modestly when you go out with him. I felt my face go hot and my hands started shaking, but I didn’t want to make a scene, so I just kept saying “I’m fine, I’m okay.”

Then my aunt puts her hand on my shoulder and says, loud, “We’re going to pray the rebellion out of you.” And before I can even process it, three other women are around me, hands on my arms, my back, my head, and they start praying out loud. Not gentle, not supportive. It was like… performance. “Lord break her will.” “Make her obedient.” “Remove the worldly influence.” Someone said “close her womb until she’s under a godly man,” which made me feel like I was going to throw up. I kept saying “please stop” but it came out tiny, and they just talked over me like I wasn’t a person. My mom was there and she didn’t stop it. She was crying and nodding like this was beautiful. I managed to step back and I said I needed air and I left the room, then left the building. I sat in my car shaking so hard I couldn’t get the key in the ignition for a minute.

When I got home my mom texted me “I’m so proud of you for letting the women cover you in prayer” and asked when I’m coming back so we can “finish what God started.” I told her I felt ambushed and humiliated and honestly scared, and she replied that fear is “the enemy leaving.” Now my aunt is messaging me Bible verses about wives, even though I’m not married, and my cousin sent me a long paragraph about how my boyfriend is “isolating me from God” when he literally hasn’t said one word about any of this. I haven’t told him yet because I’m embarrassed and also because I can already hear my family saying he’s turning me against them.

I can’t stop replaying the moment my aunt said “rebellion.” Like my wanting basic respect is rebellion. I keep wondering if I’m overreacting because it’s “just prayer,” but it didn’t feel like care, it felt like control with a smile. I don’t know how to set a boundary without getting labeled as the problem again, and I’m also sitting here realizing my own mother watched me say stop and chose their side anyway.

Runaway Houses City Clouds- absolutely perfect on a rainy day 🌧️

Endors Toi- crank it up loud AF on a sunny day with the windows down or just in your room after taking shrooms or smoking a joint

Let It Happen- this is like the final boss tame impala song, you’re just in it for the ride and there’s no getting off til the song is over 


Breathe Deeper- imagine this: 

You’re walking down the street on the way to your local coffee shop. It’s sunny, a beautiful day. 

A cute dog barks at you. Your neighbor you cant stand says hello and you actually say hello back with a smile. You feel sexy, you feel confident and chic. You  breakout into a dance in the middle of the street because you just feel like it. Someone honks at you. you feel… you feel… strange? wait… you’re already holding a cup from your local coffee shop … did someone put a tab in your coffee?

When I was a young child, I remember nighttime drives through big cities with my family. I was captivated by the streetlights that cast a peaceful, comforting, warm, and soft glow. I remember driving through the city, my gaze fixed on those streetlights. I saw them again and again on summer nights, on rainy evenings, when we could see the amber reflection on the power lines, the pavement, the bridges, the puddles. The most impressive thing was in the morning, at dawn, when it was like an orange mist over the city, observed with our eyes half-open, half-closed. These memories often come back to me, especially in the morning at dawn when I press the button on the coffee maker.  This simple gesture takes me back to my childhood, to pure innocence and all the sweetness of life in the 70s, far from the hustle and bustle, industrialization, and excitement of today. Because of these daydreams and distant memories, I couldn't resist and I installed orange light bulbs all over the house.

I am alone for the holidays and do not have any friends yet (moved recently). I wanted to ask you all - if you have recommendations on things to do for tonight and tomorrow.

Where have I been so far?

I have been to Ditty’s once, Sweet Afton twice, and Dominie’s  recently and I really loved Sweet Afton and Dominie’s. Ditty’s was good too, but a lot of people and very very crowded. Judy & Punch and the bar next to it - I forgor, has the best coffee drink/martini thing (first time for me I ever had such a drink so I apologise if I get the name wrong). Went to Mad Donkey and did karaoke for the first time in my life, and during a long walk stopped at Max German restaurant and got their fries + a nice brew. Madam Marie’s - I don’t think I will ever be back there. The bartenders have been very rude and ignorant (I know how it can be when it gets busy but it wasn’t busy and I spoke with my friends who are professional bar tenders about this and was told that they were being dicks) and it almost feels as if I am not welcome there.

What else do I do?

I am into walking too and recently did a 20+ mile walk on Sunday, walking all around Astoria - the big park, then on steinway, sunnyside, all the way to and in Greenpoint Brooklyn and back. But I think it would be too cold tonight for this. I was on that bridge to brooklyn on Sunday during the walk and it was freezing. I am into Dancing and did partake in various inter-uni competitions etc and fests - as part of my uni’s dance team as the lead and I am slowly getting back in the flow (popping, hip-hop kinds), picked up two stepping since I was in TX for some years due to a job, and previously was in PA.

I have usually been into studies and academics (research), though I work full time but I do research on the side in the AI Safety space; but I am now trying to enjoy the small and simple things. I love people watching too and striking up conversations with the bartenders, surprising some w/ treats and chocolates because this the season and it brings me so much joy to do it.

If you would have any reccs on things to do for tonight, either here or in Brooklyn - I would really appreciate it. Thank you!",12,1766612450.0,astoria,7,0.88,False

Just wanted to send a little appreciation most regarding this piece of art of a game. My old man passed of two days ago from an expected stroke my first day back home visiting from uni, he was the funniest, loving old man you could have known (69 years old! .. ha ha).

Not going to ramble much, but Dad never ever really got into gaming, let alone technology, but would always love watching me play games with his morning coffees etc (RDR2, DayZ, HLL). However, he seemed to really really take a liking to Arc! To the point of asking me to set it up on his \*work computer\* in his office! Don’t get me wrong, he wasn’t very good, but he always managed to have the most fun when we would party up together!

I am so grateful to have been able to play with my old man, no matter how out-of-the-blue the situation was, my siblings and I laugh at how odd of a game genre it was that he took a liking to!

Since I was young, I've been all about working on myself - from books and therapy, including books about growing up with Alcoholics, alcoholics in general, etc. My ex husband and I got married shortly before COVID. I started to suspect he had a drinking issue shortly after we got married. A few months into COVID, it became very clear he was an alcoholic. After one particular incident, he went to AA then claimed he wasn't like them... then came more drinking, more of the alcoholic behaviors, emotional abuse, financial issues, got fired, etc, etc. I left him.   
  
After learning more about alcoholic traits, he had a lot of them. On top of that, we disagreed politically and he fit the criteria of an abuser (not sure if anyone has ready Why Does he Do That By Lundy Bancroft - he was that guy). In hindsight, some of these traits were evident before he got married but I didn't flag them - I saw it in how he treated others, how he would ignore traffic tickets, how he didn't have much savings for his age/job level, and how he looked disheveled a lot. But I was 40 years old and REALLY wanted kids - and I'd dated for years - so I was like, maybe this is my last chance? 

When I started dating again after the divorce, I was naturally paranoid. I ended up with someone wonderful - who is very kind and thoughtful to everyone, works hard and has two older kids - we have so much in common. Super financially stable. We've now been together 2.75 years. Early on in our relationship, we talked about his love of craft beer. He knows about my ex. And, of course, he assured me he wasn't an alcoholic.   
  
I analyzed it with my therapist A LOT- i.e. I'd be like, we went on vacation and he had 3-4 beers a day. My therapist is sober (AA for 15years I think) and she was like - On vacation spread out over the afternoon/ evening, that's pretty common. Nope, he isn't an alcoholic.

Nevertheless I've been ""on alert."" While also TRYING to accept I cannot control this. 

We moved in together a few months ago. We're also in the process of renovating a house we bought together. His son is visiting from college and we are cramped in a rental. I've noticed the last 1.5 weeks or so, he has been drinking more - I know it's not healthy to track but alas here I am. :( From Friday evening to midday Sunday he went through a 12 pack - plus two more beers while out for dinner. He is kind of hiding it in that there isn't room in our fridge - he keeps it in the garage and has been using coffee mugs. Even if he isn't an alcoholic, he is clearly drinking heavily right now.   
  
Around 11:30am today, I noticed he got an ice cube and put it in a mug then walked away - and am now triggered because I'm sure he is going to pour beer into it. :(  

It's so hard not to blame myself for not catching this earlier. I'm just like - I tried so hard to avoid someone with a drinking problem! We should have lived together longer before buying a house together.

1puxzgq,https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1puxzgq/gods_will_is_a_confusing_concept/,Gods will is a confusing concept,"I mean no offence with my view or any of my enquiries- so disclaimer if you think you may be offended please don’t read!! Thank you!!

What is the meaning to believers of “gods will”? To me it sounds like an excuse of all the horrors on earth. Also- where does the idea of an “all loving” God come from? I’ve read a few chapters of the bible and it seemed that “He” hates humanity- “And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.” (Before killing everyone but Noah and his family). And then we have the end of days to come? “a time of increasing global turmoil, moral decay, and spiritual deception, marked by wars, famines, disasters, and people becoming self-centered, unloving, and resistant to God, culminating in Jesus Christ's return for judgment and the establishment of His eternal Kingdom, with key prophecies in Daniel and Revelation, and Matthew 24. Believers are warned to stay steadfast, as evil will intensify, but God's people will be saved and find eternal glory.” (From what I’ve read the reason this some about is because humanity starts worshipping a false god). There’s also this - “11The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence. 12And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.” - I thought God created earth and was all knowing and all seeing? If he created the earth or stepped in somehow wouldn’t he know what would become of us? But still decides we are mostly destined for hell? There are many things we are “condemned” to do according to the bible. However, “John 3:18 explains in the simplest terms who will go to heaven and who will go to hell: “Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because they have not believed in the name of God’s one and only Son.” So, those who go to hell are specifically those who do not believe in Jesus’ name. “ so everyone before Christianity existed was condemned? If you sin but believe you’re not condemned? These are some things you’re not allowed to do/have according to the bible:

Tattoos

Eating ham,

Rounded haircuts/beards

Circumcision

Vasectomy

Consultation of psychics, etc.

Gossiping

Passing judgement

Women grabbing men by the “secrets” (although cutting off the woman’s hand is fine.)

Children cursing their parents (putting the child to death being the recommended punishment for this)

Adultery

Working more than 6 days a week. No working on the sabbath allowed.

Women speaking in houses of god

Eating shrimp, lobster, etc.

Losing your virginity before you get married

Marrying a non-virgin

Pulling out during sex (spilling your seed on the ground) instead of impregnating your brother’s widow.

No gambling.

No cigarettes, coffee, tea, coffee or tobacco.

Do not engage in same-sex relationships

No alcohol or drugs.

Do not view pornography

Some horrible things (in my opinion) are allowed. But even if you are a Christian and do these things, if you repent it’s okay? To what extent?

What (horrible imo) things are/were allowed though( according to God):

Deuteronomy 22:28–29; God’s punishment for the raping of a virgin is to pay her father 50 shekels of silver and marry her for life. The rapist was seen as ruining someone else’s property, not ruining a young girl’s life. Forcing a girl to marry her rapist and have her father accept some money as compensation is disgusting.

2 Samuel 7:11; God, through Nathan, says he is going to punish David’s affair with Bathsheba by making all of David’s wives prostitutes. God making David’s wives prostitutes, despite what His own law said, is not moral.

Leviticus 26:29; God describes how he will punish people by making them eat the flesh of their own sons and daughters. Any God threatening to force people into cannibalism on their family is not moral.

Joshua 6:20–21; God helps the Israelites destroy Jericho, killing “men, women, young and old, cattle, sheep and donkeys”. C’mon. Ruthlessly murdering all the women and children in a city is not moral.

Deuteronomy 2:32–35; God has the Israelites kill everyone in Heshbon, including children. Later in chapter 3:3–7, God commands they do the same to the city of Bashan. Killing children ain’t moral, dude.

1 Numbers 31:7–18; God decides to not kill everyone this time. This time, He commands the Israelites to kill all the Midianites except the virgins, whom they will take as spoils of war. Killing everyone besides virgins and using them as sex slaves isn’t moral.

Genesis 7:21–23; God drowns the entire population of the earth (except for Noah and his family): men, women, and children, both born and unborn, because they were “evil”. I don’t know how unborn children could be evil, but whatever. Killing the entire population of earth, including innocent babies, is not moral.

Judges 11:30–39; Jephthah burns his daughter alive as a sacrificial offering for God’s favor in killing the Ammonites. Jephthah is crazy for burning his daughter alive and God is crazy for allowing it. Child sacrifice is not moral.

Deuteronomy 21:18–21; God demands we kill disobedient teenagers. Stoning disobedient children to death is not moral.

Exodus 21:20–21, Colossians 3:22–24, Ephesians 6:5, 1 Peter 2:18; God legitimizes slavery by saying it’s okay to own slaves and to beat them. Slaves are told to obey their masters just as they would obey Jesus, even if their masters are harsh. God blatantly supports slavery. Supporting slavery is not moral.

There’s also 45000 plus denominations of Christianity now… how does a person decide what the correct one is?

I know that was a lot of questions in one post - but what I’m mainly asking is how one decides that they’re Christian, how they decided on that denomination and what that means to them and how they can love a god and follow a book(s) that gives extremely mixed messages? To me what is “condemned” is fine and what is allowed is horrific- but this is Gods will? Which I shouldn’t question? I think Jesus was great don’t get me wrong- the best thing to come out of it all as he seemed truly loving and understanding and the fact he had to be tortured and murdered doesn’t sit right- if it didn’t even erase all sins anyway?

I’ve also read up on the books of Enoch and think they add an even more confusing layer onto Christianity- as I know they’re not the only “missing” books. From what I gathered- angels are not what we were led to believe they are and went against “Gods” instructions and God punished them. And theres also different hells?

Please don’t think I’m trying to insult anyone- I’d just truly like to understand the faith- thank you in advance for sharing any of your perspectives on any of it 🙏

This morning I woke up and for some reason, you were the first person I thought about. You don’t get mornings anymore. That still feels wrong.

I try to picture what your mornings would be like today at age 32. Maybe having your own family. Maybe rushing to work. Maybe making coffee in a small kitchen. Maybe doomscrolling on TikTok like the rest of us. You should have had the chance to find out.

In high school you were always quiet. You sat alone at lunch at the table in the very back by the library with your headphones in. I don’t know if you ever noticed, but I always saw you. 

We found out you had ended your life after winter break. I wasn’t there when it was announced. I had a bad toothache that day and missed first period. That was fourteen years ago. I still remember how quiet the room was when I walked into Mrs. Reeves theater class. 

I didn’t know you very well, not beyond your name and the way you kept your head down, but I wish I had. 

I never told you any of this while you were alive. I never wrote to you when it might have mattered.

So here are the words left unsaid in an unsent letter.

You were here. You are missed. You are important. You are mourned.

1puxw9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1puxw9m/stop_surviving_start_thriving_simple_life_hacks/,"STOP Surviving, START THRIVING! ✨ Simple Life Hacks for Max Productivity & Daily Joy. 🚀🧘‍♀️","STOP Surviving, START THRIVING! ✨ Simple Life Hacks for Max Productivity & Daily Joy. 🚀🧘‍♀️

Hey Maximizame fam! 👋

Ever feel like you're just ticking boxes, going through the motions? We've all been there. That feeling of just *surviving* can be exhausting. But what if I told you there's a whole other gear? A place where you're not just getting by, but truly *thriving*?

It's not about grand, life-altering changes overnight. It's about weaving small, powerful habits into your day that unlock your potential and sprinkle in a whole lot more joy. Let's dive into a few simple hacks that have made a huge difference for me, and hopefully, they'll resonate with you too.

**Hack #1: The ""Micro-Win"" Ritual**

Before you even get out of bed, set a tiny, achievable goal for the day. It could be:
*   Making your bed.
*   Drinking a full glass of water.
*   Meditating for 3 minutes.

Completing this tiny win first thing sets a positive momentum. It’s like a little ""I got this"" nudge that carries you forward.

**Hack #2: ""Time Blocking"" Your Energy, Not Just Your Tasks**

Instead of just blocking out time for work, think about blocking time for *your energy*.
*   Schedule in short breaks for movement.
*   Designate a ""no-screen"" zone for an hour before bed.
*   Carve out 15 minutes for something that genuinely lights you up.

This is about protecting your most valuable asset: your energy. When your energy is managed, your productivity naturally follows.

**Hack #3: The ""Gratitude Glimpse""**

Before you scroll through your phone in the morning or evening, take 30 seconds to jot down (or even just think of) three things you're genuinely grateful for. They don't have to be monumental. The smell of coffee, a kind word from a stranger, a cozy blanket – it all counts. This simple practice rewires your brain to see the good, even on tough days.

**Hack #4: Embracing the ""One Thing"" Focus**

In a world of endless distractions, the ability to focus on *one thing* at a time is a superpower. When you’re working on a task, commit to it fully. No multitasking. Close other tabs, silence notifications. You'll be amazed at how much faster and better you can accomplish things when you give them your undivided attention.

Sometimes, life throws curveballs that can make even these simple hacks feel a mountain to climb. If you ever find yourself struggling to navigate difficult emotions or challenging times, remember that seeking support is a sign of strength, not weakness. You don't have to carry everything alone. You can explore options for emotional support through [this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizame).

What are some of your favorite simple hacks for boosting productivity and finding daily joy? I'd love to hear what works for you in the comments! Let's inspire each other to move beyond surviving and truly start thriving. ✨",1,1766611960.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

This is the quieter part of the season. Less running around to markets and lightings, more family time, home projects, cozy nights in, and the occasional outdoor plan when the rain gives us a break. Walks, short hikes, beach time, errands that turn into coffee stops. Still very local, just lower volume.

January always feels like the moment everything really exhales — not because the holidays disappear, but because the chaos does. The new year is close enough to see, and the calendar opens up a little. Routines start to settle back in, and there’s finally room to breathe.

And honestly, who knows what will pop up for New Year’s Eve anyway. This place has a way of surprising us.

Ducking under Jason’s right and left hooks, he uppercuts Jason up through the floor and onto the second story before jumping through the hole in the floor and shooting a knife out of his wrist to slice at Jason when he kicks it into Nora's door and kicks Yau away, disconnecting the knife from his body. Whincing in pain, Yau points his open palm at Jason before shooting a beam out that Jason deflects upward with his knee. Running at Yau, Jason jumps up and knees him under the chin before swiftly throwing a ki ball at Yau, sending him flying outside. Breathing heavily, Jason barely dodges bullets that get stuck in the wall, twisting around on the floor, he hurls himself forward and rolls across the floor as more bullets riddle through the walls.


Grabbing a small ball, Jason smacks it, making its shield turn on; the bullets bounce off immediately. Confused and breathing heavily, Jason starts to dissociate when the shield shatters as Yaus grabs his throat, and they crash through the wall and land outside and land in the snow, throwing Jason into the surrounding forest. He jumps at him when he’s sniped in the side of his chest, falling, the ground explodes from his speed as snow, dirt, debris, and broken pieces of wood shoot up and scatter all around. Floating upward, Yau’s body tightens up as his wires and armour are slowly being pulled, slowly turning to his side as if his body is being forced to move. Yau sees that he is being forced to move as he sees Professional standing there with a rifle hung over his shoulder, when someone stabs a knife through his neck from above and flips off of him, when he sees Definition land next to Professional.


Suddenly, Definition is kicked in the side and blasted away by someone Yau barely recognises, her brown and pink hair blowing around in the wind, which suddenly sparks a memory inside his memory card, recognising Nora from the war when he saw her in the fusion between him and Judo known as Yaudo, getting mad he sees Gebura sneak up on Professional making him lose control of his powers letting Yau go. Going to attack them all, he’s attacked by Jason, who slams him into the ground before punching him away and flying towards Germany. Following Jason, he shoots out energy blasts that Jason barely dodges in midair, suddenly shooting upward. Jason swings around as a blue ball grows in his hands before he shoots it at Yau, who smacks it downward into the town below them. Diving into Yau, the two slam into the ground amidst the chaos in the town, people running everywhere as flames burn all around them, but two people stay there. 


Looking up, Kieren watches as Jason and Yau trade blows when a brick is suddenly kicked over at him, scratching his forehead. Yau, laughing at this action, smacks Jason into the ground before rushing at Kieren and Terada when Jason’s foot slams into the side of his face, causing him to land in debris and rubble. Throwing a senzu bean to Kieren, Jason runs at Yau, not noticing that his cables wrapped around Terada and Kieren unknowingly. Throwing a ki blast into the rubble, Jason causes a massive explosion just as Yau appears behind him and kicks him into the air. Flying at Jason, they clash again, throwing Kieren and Terada around before they shoot away towards the Middle East. Clashing over and over again, they cause giant gusts of wind to rock the landscape beneath them, punching Jason down into the desert. Yau laughs before blasting forward and slamming himself into Jason and punching him over and over again.

This is a follow up post from a previous post I made about my GF’s family, notably that her dad doesn’t permit her(23f) or I(24m) to be with each other in private. We go on dates but we don’t go to each other’s homes. 

At first I was open to this being parents wanting to protect their daughter thus the boundary(they have good intentions, no doubting that) but now this is just getting ridiculous. 

We both have had weird schedules recently, so we’ve taken to getting coffee every so often in the morning so we make time before we go to work. This was ok up until yesterday when her parents vetoed us going to Starbucks at 6am because that’s “too early to be hanging out”.  

Today we met up at one of our public meeting spots for a morning Christmas with movies, cooking, and opening gifts! We were originally supposed to meet at 8am however, you guessed it, “that’s too early for y’all to be alone with each other”.  So we met at 9 and she left early because “4 hours is too long to be in private”

We’ve decided we are going to have a sit down with them because she feels like she’s not trusted and that she’s kept on a leash, despite us both being adults. I don’t feel trusted either or respected, it’s not as if the things we are trying to do are wrong, what’s the issue here? No scandal no nothing.

Short Bible Study with me about Romans 6:23

Introduction
------------

Welcome, dear reader! Today, you begin a journey that may just change your perspective on life. We’re diving into a powerful verse from Romans that encapsulates the core message of the Gospel. Whether you’re seeking hope, clarity, or just a bit of inspiration, this study is crafted to uplift and encourage you. Let’s uncover the richness of God’s grace together!

Are you ready to explore how one verse can shape an understanding of eternity and purpose? Grab a cup of coffee, settle into a cozy spot, and prepare to be inspired by the simplicity yet profound depth of God’s Word. The treasures of Romans 6:23 await you, promising wisdom and renewal.

Bible Verse
-----------

Romans 6:23: “For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.”

Meaning
-------

This verse beautifully contrasts two significant truths: the consequences of sin and the gift of salvation. Paul tells us that the wages, or earnings, of sin result in death. This isn’t just a physical death but a spiritual separation from God, highlighting the gravity and serious nature of sin.

Yet, the verse doesn’t leave us in despair. Rather, it proclaims the incredible promise of God’s grace. While the wages of sin is death, the gift of God is eternal life, offered freely through Jesus Christ. This gift signifies not just duration of life, but a quality of life – abundant and full, lived in communion with God.

The term “gift” implies that it is unearned and undeserved. It’s a generous expression of God’s love and mercy, showing us that our past doesn’t define us eternally. Instead, His grace redefines our future.

This transformative message encourages believers and seekers alike to reflect on God’s immense love and the hope found in Jesus. It challenges us to embrace His gift and live in the freedom and joy that it brings.

Actions to Take
---------------

1. Reflect daily on the gift of salvation and how it impacts your life.

2. Accept the forgiveness that Jesus offers and let go of guilt or shame.

3. Share the message of God’s grace with someone in need of hope this week.

4. Cultivate gratitude by keeping a daily list of blessings.

5. Engage in regular prayer and meditation, focusing on God’s promises.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. What does eternal life mean to you personally?

2. How have you experienced God’s grace recently?

3. In what areas of life do you need to embrace more fully the gift of salvation?

4. Who can you share this incredible gift with this week?

5. Reflect on the difference between earning and receiving in your spiritual journey.

Prayer
------

Dear Lord,

Thank You for the incredible gift of eternal life through Jesus. Help me to grasp the depth of Your love and to respond by living out my days in gratitude and joy. Guide me to share Your message with others, embodying the grace and hope I find in You. Amen.

Social Posts
------------

1. “The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Embrace this gift today! #Romans623 #Grace”

2. “Reflecting on Romans 6:23 – a powerful reminder that God’s love triumphs over sin. #EternalLife #Hope”

3. “Salvation is a gift, not a reward. Let’s live in gratitude! #Faith #GodsGrace”

4. “Feeling blessed by God’s gift of eternal life. Share this joy with someone today! #ShareHope”

5. “Wages of sin vs. the gift of God: Choose the gift! #ChooseLife #BibleStudy”

Conclusion
----------

Romans 6:23 is a compass pointing us toward hope, transformation, and eternal joy. As you reflect on this verse, let it ignite your spirit and lead you to embrace the abundant life God offers. Remember, the gift of salvation is a daily invitation to walk in freedom and grace.

When I was a young child, I remember nighttime drives through big cities with my family. I was captivated by the streetlights that cast a peaceful, comforting, warm, and soft glow. I remember driving through the city, my gaze fixed on those streetlights. I saw them again and again on summer nights, on rainy evenings, when we could see the amber reflection on the power lines, the pavement, the bridges, the puddles. The most impressive thing was in the morning, at dawn, when it was like an orange mist over the city, observed with our eyes half-open, half-closed. These memories often come back to me, especially in the morning at dawn when I press the button on the coffee maker.  This simple gesture takes me back to my childhood, to pure innocence and all the sweetness of life in the 70s, far from the hustle and bustle, industrialization, and excitement of today. Because of these daydreams and distant memories, I couldn't resist and I installed orange light bulbs all over the house.

i'm finally able to eat what i want instead of hospital food.  i've gained almost 15 lbs since starting lithium and mostly on hospital food.  i've kept a rough track of my food today so far.  woke up and had a banana and orange (no photo evidence), my [bowel bowl with granola and yogurt](https://imgur.com/ZeVC67n).  getting up so early, the morning seems like mid-day and most of what i've done today was before noon.  it's not like i've been on the computer the whole time.  i had an outing with our houseguest to a bakery outside of town, got a coffee, spent time with the dog.  when we got back, i had a huge [lunch](https://imgur.com/Q9t2SXc).  four boiled eggs with ketchup, yogurt and melon, a granola bar as well as a wrap with [spinach dip and lettuce](https://imgur.com/MFpZPcR) as well as some crackers with dip.  later had a few handfuls of [dried sardines](https://imgur.com/nvROlf9) (low in [calories](https://imgur.com/2xUpVAl), high in salt, always drinking tons of water).  they're surprisingly good [with coffee](https://imgur.com/vsrZWkT).  for real.  i shared some with my fish too.  later on i baked some [date squares](https://imgur.com/o3oGK8Q) and it's actually a good thing all our butter was in the freezer because it meant i had to bake them with vegetable shortening which made them really light, although google is telling me shortening has more calories than butter.  i boil the dates in coffee and our guest brought a flavoured coffee so the taste that was lacking (and it was sorely lacking) from butter was made up for by the coffee.  

this is basically getting to be the end of the day for me.  i'm sure i'll eat something but there are no elaborate plans for dinner here, even with a guest even on christmas eve.  i'll probably take a shower and maybe have a slice of (store bought) tourtiere or some of the jello i made earlier for our guest.

Over the last year I’ve stepped outside of my comfort zone a bit and been lucky to make lots (and lots!) of new friends. I have a close circle of friends I have maintained for many years (whom I love dearly). At the start I really appreciated all the new friends inviting me out for dinner/lunch etc. The only thing is as I’m relatively friendly the requests keep increasing!

I’m so sorry if this reads as a my lobster is too buttery post. I feel genuinely appreciative that so many people want to hang out but as it’s been quite a while since I’ve been in the new stage of friendship I’m at a bit of a loss: do I kindly reject/put off hanging out with the newest friends who will be leaving the city soon? (I.e.  geographic distance will most likely mean we don’t stay in touch, especially if we’ve only hung out once/twice). Is it bad of me to turn down the offers for coffee/dinner and prioritise the friendships that I have had for longer and the new friends I see more of a long term connection with? I’m sorry if this is a silly question but I feel like I have no concept of what a ‘normal’ amount of friends look like. I have two jobs and I’ve gone back to university for my masters so I unfortunately just don’t have as much time as I’d like to pour into people. I feel like I’m being spread quite thin and it’s making me a worse friend to everyone (taking soo long to reply to messages etc).

Snow

The sky was over cast, grey and thick with humidity..  A few snowflakes floated their way down from above.    So far there wasn’t much for wind, no blue northern approaching from the northwest, but if the weatherman was correct, we were in for another blizzard starting this afternoon.   They’d been right the last two storms.  At this point, we were inclined to take their warnings seriously. 

I was tired; it’d been a long month already.   The first storm had come two weeks ago.  It hadn’t been horrible but mom had decided we needed to start gathering cattle in from some of the farther pastures, a process that had involved several days of running a cattle pot.  Days that I needed to be harvesting the crops we still had left in the field.  Then, when I’d finally been able to get back to cutting milo, the combine had caught fire, melting the wiring harness as well as most of the hoses that ran through the engine compartment.   I’d spent the rest of the week trying to piece things back together while fighting the below freezing temperatures, the short days and in the messy soup of antifreeze, oil and fire retardant that had covered the floor and pretty much every other surface of the engine compartment.  

Then the second storm had hit,   This one blew for a good three days straight and dropped nearly two feet of snow.  Very little of that snow stayed in one place and after two years of drought there wasn’t much grass in a lot of the pastures to encourage it do so.  The snow blew until it finally found a place to build a drift in the lee of.    It’d been a long time since we’d had that kind of a storm.  We’d had warning.  Enough warning that I had known to pack a bag so I could stay at my parent’s place so I could help with things at the feedyard if the roads drifted shut.  Enough warning that we set out three days of feed for the cows that were still grazing a pasture some four miles down the road.  When the storm finally cleared and we able to survey the mess left behind, it became fairly clear they needed to come home.   It was going to be fairly hard for the cows left in the pasture to forage for feed buried under the deep snow. It was probably going to be a while before the county got the road open, even longer till enough of that snow melted off they could get to feed again.   We saddled up the horses, bundled up the best we could to fight off the wind chill and set off west.  Some of it wasn’t horrible, some of it was, with our horses fighting through belly deep snow with each step.   Evidently one of our neighbors had managed to get a payloader stuck in the middle of the county road during the storm.   It had drifted over until the tires were almost completely buried.   It was a lot of snow.  It took a full day just to get the cows home, but at least they were here.....burning through hay, silage  and DDG at a rate we hadn’t really planned on.   We were going to have to make some hard decisions regarding feed usage fairly soon.   It had been another two days before the county had made it out to open up the road.   It’d only been open for two  days.   And now it was going to storm again.   We were in a much better position to deal with this one…..but I was already dreading the idea of spending another week in my parent’s house.     

I stood, watching the scene in front of me.   A semi-truck headed back towards town after making a feed delivery to a place further down the road had managed to get stuck in the county road right in front of our drive.   The roads were a mess right now.  So far, the county had managed to make a single pass with the V plow down must of them, but they’d left a good half foot of snow below the plow trying to avoid catching the gravel.  What had been left had turned to horribly bumpy mixture of slush, ice and mud.  It wasn’t a huge surprise the truck had gotten stuck, semis tended to be rather miserable at getting around when they were empty...but it had definitely turned itself into a problem.  With snow drifts a good four feet deep on either side of the trail carved through them,  nobody else was going anywhere either.

I’d already tried to help,   Since the truck was blocking our drive, it had taken nearly an hour to dig through the snow banks with the loader tractor just to get in front of the truck.   When we’d finally been able to hook the chain up, the tractor hadn’t been able to find enough grip to get the truck moving.   The trucker thought maybe it might be possible to get it free if we pulled it back down the hill it had been coming up but it was going to take at least even longer just to make to the other end of his outfit.  There was a really deep ravine to the south  and the snow drift on the north side of the truck was even deeper than the rest of the road.  He decided to call the place he’d made the feed delivery to; they were going to send a tractor over as well.  Maybe between the two of us we could get the trucker on his way.

A small grey SUV approached from the west, it sat waiting at the top of the hill in one of those few places where the snow had blown off the road enough two vehicles could pass each other.   I had a pretty good guess who it was but I’d never met her.  Story was that she had given up her job in one of the nearby cities to come take care of her grandma who had lived on a ranch tucked way back into the hills east of us.  Eventually grandma had ended up having to go to a nursing home, but she was still here, working entry level jobs in town trying to make ends meet.  The few times I’d seen her when she went by on the road…she seemed stressed out of her mind and deeply unhappy.  

Our neighbor showed up with his tractor and was able to get the semi pulled backwards to another patch where the road had blown off enough to squeeze a vehicle past.   By now the wind was starting to pick up and those scattered snow flakes were beginning to fall with an increased frequency.   Evidently while the trucker had been waiting he’d called county, they were sending a road grader out.   He had decided he was going to sit right there until they got here.   I wasn’t really sure how anybody had enough clout to get a road grader on demand, let alone in a snow storm.  I told him if he got tired of sitting in his truck, we had a food and a place he could hide till the storm was over.   He didn’t seem much inclined to take me up on the offer so I let him be.   The gal in the SUV was going to follow our neighbor’s tractor back across the river where it had come from.    Satisfied that everything had been taken care of, I headed back to the shop to put the tractor away and hopefully get a little lunch.  

I’d just walked in the door and started to take off all my heavy clothes when the phone rang, It was the gal in the SUV.   She hadn’t been able to keep up with the neighbor’s tractor and had gotten stuck in a snowbank somewhere east of our place.  By the time she’d been able to get him called, he was already on the other side of the river and said he wasn’t going back.  I told her I’d bring a tractor and get her pulled out.  I put my coveralls back on, the rest of my heavy clothes and then headed back to the shop.  By now it was definitely starting to pick up.  

It was a whole different world when I pulled out onto the road and past the protection provided by our tree breaks.  A cold north wind hurled snowflakes sideways and visibility had shrunk to less than fifty feet.   I passed the semi still parked on the side of the road and pushed further east.  That was when the real work began.  By now, the storm had already started to pack the trail cut by the road grader full of snow.   I’d push snow with the loader until the tractor wasn’t going forward anymore, then back up enough I could get a little bit of a run at things and then hit that drift again.   And then again.   And again.  Over and over.  I wasn’t really sure how much progress I was making…..by now the visibility had become so bad that at times I couldn’t even see the grapple forks of my own loader.   A cold wind cut through the cab and kept freezing over the inside of the windshield forcing me to stop periodically and scrape the frost off the inside of the glass.  Within minutes it frost over again; we’d had to pinch off the coolant lines that ran to the cab heater because the heater core had developed a leak and we just hadn’t had the time to fix it yet.  

It was getting worse, even when the windshield was cleaned off, I could barely see the fence posts on the side of the road, or at least the little bit of them still sticking up through the snow.   It looked like I was still going straight and in the center of the road, but I really couldn’t see the path left by the road grader.   I wasn’t sure just how far I’d gone, or even just exactly where I was.   I’d passed the spruce tree and the abandoned house that sat on the south side of the road, barely able to see them through the snow.   I’d made it at least a half mile… I wasn’t sure how much farther I’d made it since.  How far had she thought she’d been from our place?  A mile?   I hoped I didn’t just smash into the back of her car, things had picked up again.  

Then it cleared up and I could see the windows of her car less than a hundred feet away.  The body was mostly buried, and snow had begun to drift over the hood.  I got as close as I could with the tractor, and then climbed out and grabbed the scoop shovel we carried on the side of the loader.   I made her way up to the window and was greeted by a torrent of hurried and anxious words.  She was cold and frightened,  bundled up in every bit of clothing she’d had in her car and holding some sort of small dog in her arms as closely as she could.    He seemed just as cold and terrified as she did.     The inside of her windshield was frosted over as well…despite the fact she’d been running her car and it appeared she had her heater on its highest setting.    It was cold standing there, the wind cut through my winter clothes.   I told her I needed to clear enough road that she could turn around after I pulled her out, I wasn’t willing to go any further east.  I’d also have to scoop enough snow to figure out where I could hook onto her vehicle.  

It was one of those Japanese outfits with plastic bumpers and no good place to hook onto.  By now the snow had completely packed in underneath her vehicle.   It wasn’t going to be a soft pull,  not without a lot of digging.   If I hooked onto the frame it was going to tear her bumper off.  There wasn’t enough space to slip a chain through her wheel rims.   I didn’t have any straps      I wasn’t sure how long it’d take to dig everything out enough she could back it out on her own.   A half hour?  More?    .   It was getting darker and the storm starting to close in again,    The wind was coming from the northwest,   when I’d headed east I’d at least had the wind somewhat at my back, it was going to be more difficult to see on the way back.   It might be damned near impossible when it got dark.  We were going to be in a world of hurt if I got the tractor stuck as well.   There were close to 500 mouths counting on it being able to run in the morning. 

 I talked her into abandoning her car and riding back to my parents place in the tractor with me.   When the snow cleared we’d try again.    We climbed into the cab, it would have been a tight fit anyways, it was even tighter with us both bundled up in clothing as she tried to get situated on the edge of the cab next to the seat.   I scraped the inside of the windows off again turned around and pointed my tractor home.  

We probably hadn’t made it a quarter mile before we began to see flashing orange lights somewhere ahead.     A road grader emerged through the swirling snow. I pulled over to the side of the road, and then climbed out of the cab to visit with the driver.  Evidently the county really had sent a road grader out for the truck, actually two of them, and when they’d gotten to our place the trucker told them that I had passed him headed east a good hour ago but hadn’t made it back yet.  The road grader driver had decided to go looking for us while the other machine worked on trying to open the road up enough the truck could make it up the hill by our place.   I told him I’d follow him back and then watch him go through the awkward process of trying to turn his big machine around on a road where he had to push snow several feet deep out of the way with every wiggle of the machine.  

He got turned around and began pushing back into the storm.   When I tried to pull back into the center of the road, our tractor just spun.   Evidently I’d pulled just a little too far off to the side.  I climbed out of the cab and tried to run after the road grader.  I could no longer see him….I could hear him, hear the whine of the engine, the rattle of the snow chains, feel the edges of the trench he’d cut through the snow….but I couldn’t catch him and with each agonizing breath it seemed like he was getting just a little further away.   I gave up and walked back to the tractor, dejected and frustrated. I did my best to try to dig things out.   I tried to use the bucket to pull us back onto the road It didn’t matter, there was just too much slope and the ground was too icy for the bucket of the tires to bite in.   

My companion had grown quiet..  Maybe should tell I was mad,  maybe she could tell I was worried.    I was…on both accounts.  Frustrated I’d got the tractor stuck, frustrated I’d pulled just a little too far to the side, frustrated that the chains we ordered for the tires after that first storm  weren’t here yet….they were supposed to be here later this week but that wasn’t doing me much good right now.   Frustrated that the reason we didn’t have the MFWD was because it kept locking up the right planetary. We’d rebuilt it 3 times in the last three years,  each time it had cost several thousand dollars…..1500 if I did the rebuild, close to 4 if the dealership did it,  I’d taken it to them in the off chance I was doing something wrong.  Their build hadn’t lasted any longer   And of course, it always seemed to lock up somewhere really inconvenient.  The last time it’d locked up I’d gotten frustrated and pulled the guts out of both sides and decided we could run it as a 2wd tractor.  We’d gotten away with it for several years, but right now that seemed like a really stupid decision.   I wasn’t really sure what I was going to do if we couldn’t get the tractor home, we needed it to load the feed wagon tomorrow morning, and it needed to get back in the shed tonight.   As cold as it was there was no way in hell it was going to start in the morning if I shut it off.  And that still didn’t answer how I was going to get it back on the road.  It was going to be even harder if it turned into an even bigger snow drift like that payloader had last week. 

We sat there….I don’t know how long.    Surrounded by that white haze, wondering how long it would be until it began to turn dark.  Trying to not to shiver, trying not to complain about the cold.   What good would it do?

  And then the road grader came back.  He’d gotten worried when we hadn’t shown up.  We hooked the chains up, and he yanked me out of the ditch, and this time I followed him back….just as close to those flashing yellow lights as I thought I could get away with.   We parted ways at our driveway, they headed west with the semi while I could finally tuck the tractor back into its heated shop for the night.  It had been several hours since I’d left the shop.   For the first time I began to see the hint of a smile on my passengers face.   We headed down to the folk’s house in hopes they either still had some coffee or were willing to make some.   It was just so nice to be back.  They had coffee, even still had some of the soup they’d made for lunch.  There wasn’t much to do other than talk and play cards until everybody decided it was bed time.  

The next several days settled into a routine of feeding, pushing snow, playing cards, doing dishes and talking,…a lot of talking.  It was a nice distraction. It was a distraction from how much I hated being stuck in my parent’s house. Where the thermostat was all was always set far too hot and the water for the shower far too cold.    The way I hated simply being around them; my mother with her contempt and disdain for nearly everything and everyone, my father with his sense of pompous arrogance and self-professed expertise on nearly everything.   The way I felt suffocated., like I had never grown up and become my own person, the way that I felt suffocated, as if it was some unwritten rule that I wasn’t allowed to do that. 

Although I’d been on hrt for two years, I hadn't come out to them yet, I lived with the knowledge that at some point it was going to become an issue. At some point they were going to notice the way my body was changing.   I was dreading that day. I already knew how they felt about the subject.  I knew how my siblings felt about subject.    I knew how that they didn't believe that gender dysphoria was a thing. How they didn't believe that just because some people had a mental illness should mean that the rest of society should have to accommodate them.  How they believed that mental health professionals should be helping these people get over their fantasies rather than facilitating the ability to pursue a life that was a lie, completely disconnected from physical reality.  I’d watched those conversations unfold at the dinner table while I kept my silence, unwilling to draw a bullseye on myself, absorbing every comment dripping with disdain and disgust.   I could only avoid things for so long, at some point they would notice, at some point that disdain and contempt was going to be turned upon me.   I was dreading the thought of that experience. I wondered to what extent they were already beginning to suspect.  Mom was definitely not a big fan of the fact I was growing my hair out and after 30 years of nearly everybody using a shorter version of my name that could be used by either gender, they had begun calling me by my full name,  as if it was some sort of passive aggressive move meant to remind me that I was male, remind me of who I really was, remind me of who I was expected to be.  It was an unresolved conflict just waiting to go nuclear.  One of the most valuable things about having my own home was the ability to escape from that conflict for at least a few hours each day. That wasn't going to happen anytime soon. Not till the roads got opened up.   That wasn’t going to be for a while.  I was stuck here I got desperate enough to start slogging back and forth by foot.

 

But so was this neighbor I’d only just met,  it was nice to talk to someone.  I hadn't had a good enjoyable conversation with anybody other than my brother in years.  I enjoyed talking with her. She was quick witted and funny. We had a similar sense of humor.   As a general rule, she was generous and kind towards others. We talked about her various life experiences. The ranches she'd grown up on, her journey to faith,  her trips to South America and Africa.  About how she was worried how her cats were doing and whether her furnace had stayed on, or if her pipes would freeze up.  About the chain of events that had led her to taking care of her grandma and then choosing to keep living in her Grandma's house.  Honestly, it didn’t really matter the subject, I just liked hearing the sound of her voice, liked watching the way she lit up playing cards.   I was enjoying the way that talking passed the time.  I was enjoying he gift of having a conversation with someone who didn't come across as if they believed that I was some sort of monster that needed to be destroyed.  Still a nagging thought lurked underneath the surface. She was fairly religious. What if she actually knew? That I was trans?   Would she even still speak to me?

 

It was Christmas Eve when the county finally opened up the road.   We rescued her car from where it had been stranded and then I made in my way into town to see if the tire chains had come in and take care of some last minute shopping; whiskey for the grader operators, some candy and a stocking for her and the college kid we had working for us. I was going to be getting to go home that night but she would still be stuck at my folk's house a little longer.  She actually lived in the next county over, it usually took them an extra day or two to get things opened up after it's snowed.

 

The next morning once I got done with feeding and all the ice was chopped, I poked my head in to see how she was doing.   The folks had left for church, she was fixing to leave for her brother's house fairly soon to share Christmas dinner with his family.    She’d probably be back that evening, but as soon as the rest of the road got opened up she’d be headed home. Somehow it got brought up that we should try to stay in touch.

 

I’m not sure why I told her.   Maybe it was that she seemed like a safe person I could trust.  Maybe it was the way that my ex's words still echoed in my ears.  The admonishment that if I ever gotten involved with a girl again I needed to be completely up front and honest with who I was,  that no woman should ever have to go through the experience that she had.   Each word had been laced with anger, bitterness and betrayal.  Maybe it was simply that whatever part of me it was the demanded chaos had decided to come out to play, bound and determined to ruin this week that we had spent together.  

 

“I'd like to too, but there's something you need to know first” 

 

 She looked at me wearily, hesitant and unsure of what shoe was about to drop next.

 

“I'm trans.”

 

 She looked confused.

 

“One of those people who take hormones to try to change their gender, I’ve been on them for about two years.”

 

 Now,  I was waiting for the other shoe to drop too.  Outside of therapists and the doctors I’d had to work with, I hadn't told anybody.  At least not anybody other my fiance who was now my ex.  The last time this had become part of a conversation it had shattered her heart and destroyed the happy home that we had shared.   

 

“You're still a person.  ………..And I like you.”  

 

Her voice was kind, lacking those telltale signs of disgust.  Tears streamed down my face, I would have never believed I would hear those words again, let alone in the same sentence,  not out here, not by somebody who knew the whole truth.  My whole life I had lived with the understanding that if people really knew what was going on in the inside they would never want anything to do with me again. When I had chosen to pursue medically transitioning, I had understood the trade. That choosing to pursue this idea of a version of me that I actually would like, would mean becoming something that was vile and disgusting to everybody else.

 

She asked if she could give me a hug, that she had been wanting to since the day that we got here.   I nodded and as she wrapped her arms around me, I absolutely melted.   Overcome by just how much I had missed physical touch,  how much my soul had craved it, needed it,  needed to feel like it wasn't just some sort of monster that need to be kept far, far away.

 

I would end up going with her to her brother's for Christmas dinner. The food was amazing; prime rib that had been in the smoker since the day before, mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese with creamed corn and God knows how much Velveeta in it.  We talked, laughed, and played cards.  For a few hours, I was something other than just the freak waiting to be run out of town…. I was the person who went looking for someone they cared about in a snowstorm…. and that felt really nice.. .. Even if I was pretty sure that anybody else in my shoes would have done the same thing.   I just happened to be the closest person with a tractor; the one who got the phone call.

 

Eventually, we would end up pursuing a relationship with each other.  The kind with long phone calls that lasted way too late into the night, where you talked about anything and everything just to hear the sound of each other's voice, the magic in each other's laugh.  The kind with Sunday afternoon dates that consisted primarily of cutting firewood, fixing dinner for each other and watching movies while cuddled up on the couch.  There was something special about being known and seen completely and fully….and having somebody decide to keep you in their life anyways; scar's, secrets and all. 

 

Eventually, life would teach me the harder lessons as well.  That even relationships that begin as if straight out of the script of some Hallmark Christmas special would still come with their own difficulties and troubles. That hearts are messy and complicated things.  That in truth we were meant to fall in love once and have it last forever.  That every time it doesn't, our hearts are scarred and changed forever, and each new attempt to pick up the pieces in love again comes burdened with thousands of triggers, insecurities and memories that must be navigated in order to keep that new relationship alive.   That relationships are as unique as the individuals involved, that simply getting into a new relationship was very unlikely to fulfill all of those things that you missed from your previous one.  That there is a special kind of heartache that comes with choosing to pursue another relationship when you're still not really quite over your last one.  That it's one thing to think that something is over and can never be again,  it's an entirely another thing to choose to make decisions that ensure it really can't.   For me those realizations would be a death every bit as heavy as the day that my ex had decided that we were over.  

 

To be honest, I'm not entirely sure she actually understood what she was getting into.  There are so many things about this being trans business I don't think she understands it all.   Yet somehow, we have still managed to survive, still choose to look for the good in each other,  still choose to believe in the idea of us,  still choose to pursue that idea that, love always hopes always perseveres, that love never fails.   We still choose to try to show up for each other even when it's hard.   

 

That winter would be one for the history books with a weather pattern that delivered new storms on a weekly basis well until the end of March.   For my generation it will likely be talked about for years to come in the same way the old timers talked about the harder winters of their younger years.  It would be a winter of trying to stretch feed resources and the never-ending slog of pushing snow.  But for me, it would also be the winter that I felt like I began to come alive, The winter in which I got more ice time in than I had in years, one in which I discovered the power that having even only one person who still believed in you could have on changing the way you thought about yourself.  That winter will always be the one where we showed up as each other's Christmas Angel.  Not the kind that sits on top of a tree, or even the kind that sings to sheperds of peace and goodwill and a baby in a manger.  Instead we would be the kind who would show up for each other in life's toughest storms, reminding each other that we still mattered, were still worth being cared for, were still worthy of being loved.",8,1766610844.0,TransLater,0,1.0,False
1puxih6,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1puxih6/first_time_buyer_in_scotland_how_much_mortgage_is/,"First Time Buyer in Scotland- How much mortgage is affordable on £37,000 salary?","Hi everyone,

Sorry to write another “can I afford this mortgage” post, but I'm a first time buyer (26F) and I'm going it solo and I keep reading very mixed messages about affordability (probably because of how the housing market has screwed us youngsters in recent years making the old advice futile). 

I am planning to move back to Scotland (studied my MSc there) and buy a property in a year or two ideally. Edinburgh would be the eventual dream but alas for now I'd be looking at Falkrik, Dunfermline, Fife, some parts of East/Mid Lothian, Stirlingshire, or furthest Glasgow (commutable to Edinburgh/ Glasgow in under 1.5 hours max, ideally under 1 hour).

In a year or so, my salary should be at least £37,000 annually pre tax + a potential annual bonus of between about £1,000 - £3,000 (income tax free!). This assumes I will stay at my current company (though I might move to a higher paying job). The bonus isn't 100% guaranteed but has been relatively stable for a long while (covid year being the only exception).

By the time of purchase I will have saved c.£66,000 - £70,000 (I've been living with my elderly grandparents and looking after them in lieu of rent, amen!). I am planning on allocating £40,000 of this to a deposit (or deposit + offers over HRV amount), £10,500 ish for legal fees and furniture (and a small amount of LBTT if needed), and £15,000 for an emergency fund (in case of illness, redundancy, emergency house repairs). I will also have an additional £4,000 invested in an S&S ISA.

I know that whether I go down the Scottish “offers over” route or buy a fixed price new build will influence the size of my deposit and therefore my interest rate and repayments (as I understand it, using my £40k entirely as a deposit on a fixed price property will likely unlock lower interest rates and repayments than divvying up the £40k between a deposit and “offers over” HRV amount on some properties- though please correct me if that's wrong!). But whatever I buy, in essence I think I can afford monthly repayments up to a maximum of around £740. 

My take home pay per month (based on £37,000 minus 2 student loans) will be about £2370.

I anticipate monthly bills in the following ballpark:

Mortgage MAX: £740
Council tax (single discount, based on property bands I've seen): £140
Gas and electric: £110
Water: £40
Home insurance: £40
Food: £200 (I'm on a special diet so I don't drink or eat out and I get colleague discounts at Tesco as my mum works there)
Internet/ TV/ Netflix: £55
Contact lenses: £28.50 (though from my work health insurance plan I get £250 out of £342 of this back a year) 
Phone bill: £10
Toiletries/ self-care: £80
Social/ hobbies: £100 (at weekends I would mainly see friends for a coffee, hike, do day trips to castles in the highlands, go to galleries, sometimes to the cinema, or occasionally horse riding, so honestly I don't spend loads! Also paid for most activities during uni with my Tesco club card lol) 
Car (petrol/ insurance): £190 (I haven't bought a car yet but I'm saving for this too and I'll buy a £4k ish car second hand outright)
Train: £126 (I work in office 2 days a week currently and my company has an office in Edinburgh I can transfer to; this price is based on the furthest/ most expensive I'd be willing to commute aka from Glasgow. NB- I could also drive/ park and ride if it's cheaper!)

Total: £1857 max 

So of my net salary of £2370, I would have about £512 left per month. 

I've also budgeted for about £600 a year in random extras (1 haircut (I have curly hair lol), gifts for people, a trip home for Christmas etc.) Most of my health/ dental/ optical bits are covered by insurance already so I'm not too worried about those. 

So per year, I should have about £7050 left (including the minimum likely bonus, but the total could be as high as about £9100). I thought I could allocate this as follows (based on minimum bonus):

Pension: extra £1000
S&S ISA: £2050
Emergency fund booster: £1000 (+£600 annual interest ish)
Holidays and extras: £3000 (I have a travel bucket list!)

And if by some disaster we don't get a bonus one year, I'd cut back on the holiday spending lol. I'd also not do any holidays in year 1 to sense check my spending! 

As I said before £740 per month would be my absolute maximum for mortgage repayments, I think the sweet spot would be <£700 ish. I'm not expecting a huge house or anything ridiculous (I'd be happy in a cute one bed flat), I'd like somewhere comfortable enough for one person/ maybe a partner and in a decent enough, commutable area (I currently commute 1hr 45mins one way, 3.5hrs round trip into London two days a week and it's a killer!). Plus my salary is likely to keep increasing annually.

Do you think the above budget is affordable/ comfortable? Is there anything I'm majorly missing? Do my outgoing estimates look realistic? 

Any general advice about buying solo, especially in the Scottish system, would also be appreciated as well as any recommended areas which are nice and good value for FTBs!

Or, I survived Geek Village Winter Tales and all I got was this half priced coffee.","**This is an account from a vendor who was present at Geek Village in the Dark Alley and who placed this on a publicly accessible website. I have their permission to post this on Reddit, since they do not have an account.**

I met some amazing people this weekend.

I am an artist, a small creator who cheerily jumped at a chance to display my wares at a little convention in Belgium, The Geek Village, which winter edition Winter Tales was to take place in Hasselt. A bit of a trip for me from Amsterdam, but manageable. I was excited. I was nervous.

It had been a bit of a nerve wreck for a while actually: the organizers had not shared a floorplan with us, a practice that allows artists to contact their neighbors in advance and more importantly, to advertise their participation in the convention that by proxy spreads news about the event itself. They also did have a mild issue with sending everyone a timely email with basic info such as where to park, but those SNAFUs happen. Right?

The day started with a bus ride enriched by meeting a fellow traveler in need, but otherwise uneventful, all according to plan.

I arrived at Hasselt station, had lunch, caught a bus to the outskirts where the Trixxo Arena is located. Unlike most of the sellers coming I had no car so I trotted through the vast parking lot, suitcases full of my wares in toe. And then I saw the line. I thought briefly that perhaps it was normal, after all I do not have that much experience. Maybe we just waited for one last thing to be set up inside (despite it nearing four and the set up times being scheduled to start at two) and then we would all walk in, get our lanyards or wristbands and get on with the set up, right?

It was over an hour and a half that I stood in that line. I crocheted nearly the entirety of a Santa hat in that line. I watched the sky turn deep navy and lights of the parking lot flicker to life in that line as murmurs around me made it increasingly clear that not only is this not normal, this is very worrying. But! At last, it was my turn, and so I trotted over to a young volunteer (made even younger in my eyes by their braces) with a laptop who did not even ask for my vendor ticket, just the name of my business before issuing me with a coated paper wristband and waving me in the direction of “that lady in a coat with a fur trim” who would know about the set up of the hall where I were to display. That’s what I waited in December, outside, for an hour and a half for?

The lady in the coat with a fur trim was talking to a taxidermist with a van who apparently waited for two and a half hours and was at last directed to his – and mine – hall, so I hopped into his van and with a pheasant on my lap I listened to his spilling anger as we drove to another hall of the arena.

There, things did not appear much better, despite it supposedly being “almost set up”. The hall was desperately empty, a few other artists of the Dark Alley - as that part was to be called - setting up with candles, skull based flower arrangements and gothic fashion. We were told to just find names of our businesses written on the ground, which they were: in chalk that clearly faded amongst the cars driving in and out of the hall. We were then left to our own devices to chase after the arena’s employees and con volunteers to get tables for our set ups. Once again, no one asked us to prove anything, including how many tabled did we rent for the weekend. At last, we could set up, and given both of us were on that day without a helper, we helped each other and ended up ones of the last ones to leave the arena. The taxidermist, Jack, drove me to my hostel and set on his way to return to the Netherlands to sleep in his own bed. It was a little bit late to start hesitating now.

The following day I made sure to rise early, get to the con site early and start well. I try to be open to any opportunities and tell myself an event on which I got my investment back is one that was still worth doing. And even if the set up here was not great, surely, it’s a convention, it is defined by the audience that comes to it. I was finishing my set up, worryingly eyeing a *Just Dance* station just a few meters behind me. I also started hearing a grating, buzzing sound exploding from time to time. It also seemed that the organizers had no intention of actually separating our part of the floor from the rest of the hall, leaving the con goers free reign to walk behind and around us – something not good for business at best of times and downright putting us at risk of theft or harassment at worst.

The door opened at nine fifty, twenty minutes later than in the schedule for the early bird arrivals. The line of visitors looked substantial from my spot, but it quickly became clear that it ended just outside of where I could see, the expected wave of nerd being a sad trickle. I was making sales, but they were sporadic and the interactions rather awkward, the con goers themselves catching up to something being awfully wrong here.

We were meant to be separate from the rest of the artist alley to create thematic sections of the convention. It would be a good idea, if these pockets would naturally lead from one another, but our witchy and retro section was to turn out to be in a room full of computers, gaming stations and electronics. That meant that many visitors walked right by us, confused by the layout. And it’s not like they had a convenient floor plan beyond a rudimentary breakdown of where the sections of the conventions were, that lacked any statement about us actually selling products. It also meant we were not in a hall intended for people to stay in for long hours. The *Just Dance* game started attracting dancers quickly and I was a subject to an array of dance-ready versions of pop from *Gangam Style* through *Tender Whisper* to the *Ghostbusters* theme the entire day. On top of that, the buzzing I heard turned out to be a singing Tesla coil, on which anyone could and apparently everyone did, play. Around four hours in I called Jack over, thanks to an R2D2 cosplayer who kindly delivered a message for me. He had helpers that day and so was able to leave his stand in his hands when I took a break from the buzz to pee and seek somewhere to get a coffee. At a hot drinks stand ran by the volunteers I heard that I do not get anything for free as a vendor nor can I even purchase a cup of coffee: I first need to spend three euros on a drink token in a token vending machine and then use that token.

I returned to my stand without a coffee.

At four I was so spent by a constant barrage of the coil on one and the *Just Dance* on another I put out a card saying “tap me if you need anything”, put on headphones and just held my face in my hands to cut myself off from the world around me.

After, a kind vendor from the 18+ area came over to ask if I am okay and if she could do anything for me. Apparently, the 18+ area, that ought to be separated from the rest of the floor had a perfectly good view on us. (Later I learnt there was also no ID check to get into it). She could only offer kind words, but it was a delight of a gesture. After her, an older woman in a Venetian mask appeared, I am not sure if she was a visitor or also a vendor, but she managed to find for me ear plugs and a paracetamol.

I was out of water, so I sent a sweet group of cosplayers on yet another side quest to refill my water. They came through above and beyond and brought me also a portion of overprized and oversauced fries, that were the tastiest thing I ever had.

At six, I wanted out. Some vendors around me were packing. Not to close for the night, to leave Geek Village all together.

In my hostel I ran into the lovely cosplayers, as well as another vendor The Drunken Snake and helper. Together we concocted an idea. I would not be able to stand another day next to the coil and with so many artists leaving, or, as it turns out, having been turned away on Friday when the volunteers no longer wanted to be dealing with them, there were plenty enough tables and enough space for me to just move to the Artist Alley.

The next day I hitched a ride with the Drunken Snake, and with the help of them, Jack and another vendor we carried my set up to the Artist Alley. The murmur of that hall was a glorious silence to me. The spot I took had a piece of paper stating “To the organizers. Got sick when waiting on Friday and had to go home”. No surprise there, a lot of convention artists are disabled and so this mode of making income is fitting their irregular schedules. This shitshow, as I could no longer think of this weekend any different, had to be a special kind of hell for the physically disabled.

The day was somehow even slower. I presume it might be because a lot of the visitors who paid to be here through the weekend cut their loses and decided it is not worth it to come back on Sunday. I would leave my stand, no concern even for theft, the crowd was so sparce. My new cosplayer friends gifted me an ice tea and invited me to see one of them in a cosplay competition “if I can”. It’s not like I predicted massive losses to come from me leaving the stand for ten minutes and so I did come. That is at the competition where it hit me, how strangely uneven the organization was: there were decent celebrity guests. There was a great number of artists coming. The cosplay competition was a Nordic Cosplay Championship qualification contest, with the winner set to go to Sweden to represent Belgium at NCC upcoming summer an win corporate sponsored awards. And yet, we were managed by clueless volunteers, had nearly no contact with the actual organizers and only on Sunday someone tried to ease our troubles: we were offered coffee, half priced for vendors. The movement of crowd through the hall I escaped was also slightly managed now, with route behind sellers quartered off, for all good it did with several of the vendors gone already, having cut their losses.

The cosplay contest was also, of course, delayed, and so instead of being on my break there for ten minutes, I ended up on the tribune for nearly half an hour. It did not matter in the slightest form my business, my neighbor who was keeping an eye on my stand needed to do nothing for me. I rebooked my bus out of Hasselt, paying nearly as much as for another ticket, left an hour before the original end of the convention, after a mom-helper and a girlfriend-helper from other stands helped me expertly to dismantle my stand and pack. I said bye to artists I befriended, shared stickers. Traded an art piece for bones with Jack, I think I will stay in contact with him. And the cosplayers, they were a great bunch. On my way out a tiktoker whose name I never learnt helped me to pull my suitcase and so I made my early bus.

I was moving through the convention in a state of anger and bafflement, more confused than furious, and fury was warranted. I could not help but feel like we were either treated like a duck decoy, appearing as if the event was a convention only enough to attract convention comers who would make it into the real thing on purpose, or that the organizers were incompetent or opportunistic (or both) and presumed that having a hall and stalls in it was enough to call this thing we were doing a convention.

I felt we were used, our love, the fandom, our kindness towards each other, were all used. The con scene is one sustained by a copious and uncountable amount of informal effort that cannot be easily pinpointed economically as those who perform it dance somewhere in between homo ludens who play through cosplay, performance art and design and doers of invisible labour. That is also true of fandom more broadly. It is fanfic writers and fanart artists who film studios, video game designers and writers don't pay who save them uncountable amounts in advertising. I am a child of the 21st century and first met Buffy and The Doctor through fanfiction. I glimpsed a cosplay competition contestant whose costume I did not know and through piecing together the lines from their sound bite I arrived at listening to Critical Role (I am over 200 episodes in).

Our helpers is who make art a sustainable source of income, as it is often a necessity to rely on partners, parents, friends to aid us for no pay but our gratitude. The kind gesture of sharing a con haul after an event is what we hope for from our clients to hopefully broaden our social media reach. We love each other. Giving away stickers for little “side quests” for clients is charming and sweet and I would do it no matter what, because it is nice to see someone smile. But these niceties, gestures of good will and sympathy what builds a community where you can count on someone to help you out, to get you a coffee, to share a stand at a next event. Kindness is an ethical choice, but is also what factors into the precarious economies of an artist’s life.

We do not like to think about those acts of love as labour as that connotes effort, work done only for either gain or because ""someone has to do it"" as it is true of invisible labour performed at home. It is however labor in the economical sense: it produces value where once there was none. To love it, is not to diminish that, despite out love often being used against us: who of us artists was not asked to create something for free, because after all, we like to do it. In fandom we do labour of love, but it is not the love that kept me in that line on Friday. It was the thought that I already spent two hundred euros to be there, and if I would tap out I would loose that. I did not have two hundred euros to waste.

It is this economic precarity and that love that Geek Village exploited. It exploited vendors who counted on a pre-Christmas weekend of good sales. It exploited cosplayers who work tirelessly at perfecting dozens of interlacing disciplines and who count on these events to be seen and to interact with their peers. It exploited volunteers at who we found ourselves snapping at as they helplessly shrugged at get another question to which the answers they should have. It exploited out kindness to each other because it is what we needed to count on rather than organizers to simply get by through it.

I sincerely hope this convention never takes place again, I hope my peers who attempt to get some of their investment back from the organizers get what they ask for. And I hope the people responsible for this find out tomorrow their electric stopped working the moment they went to sleep and the waiting on a phone to get someone to fix it is at least half as long as what we waited that Friday.",1,1766610788.0,BehindTheBooths,0,1.0,False

Being here lately has made me feel like I’m 14 again (I’m 24 now), staying up late and shipping Supernatural and Doctor Who, with that same sense of excitement, comfort, and belonging. I didn’t expect to feel this again, and it genuinely means a lot. I remembered the usernames of some people. I loved laughing out loud at your comments. I saved playlists you created. I read your analyses and theories after work.

I really hope this community stays forever and keeps alive, like House M.D. or Harry Potter.

What really stands out to me is how much Byler shippers seem to have in common: good hearts, kindness, sensitivity, and a real care for stories and for each other. There’s something very warm and human about this space.

So I had an idea! Maybe the mods could create a pinned thread for meeting up in real life? A post where people could share their city or country, and maybe make it easier to connect offline someday for a cup of coffee.

As for me, I live in Cyprus :)

Thank you all for making this community feel safe, alive, and unexpectedly nostalgic.",11,1766610727.0,byler,8,0.92,False

I’ve been living in Saudi for a bit now and I am honestly so inspired by all the growth happening here right now. I’m a girl with a huge ""business brain,"" but I’m finding it a bit lonely trying to come up with ideas on my own.

I’m not Saudi myself, but I’d love to connect with some local girls (or other expats!) who are ambitious and want to build something cool together. I have some background in various fields like sales, marketing, social media, finance and I’d love to find someone to brainstorm with over coffee or even just a chat to see if our vibes match.

I’m interested in things like perfumes and female only services, but I’m totally open to hearing what you’re passionate about.

If you’re a girl in KSA who’s tired of the 9-5 or just wants to start a side hustle, please reach out! Let’s see if we can make something happen.",4,1766610364.0,Entrepreneur,1,1.0,False

I've been a tech lead at several companies.  My resume is pretty nice but I've struggled a lot with interpersonal relationships.  So much that I really don't have that much of a network after all these years.

I'm 54 and just got my ASD diagnosis a few weeks ago, so I finally have some answers on why I've struggled with building relationships.  It has honestly been a mystery to me all this time.  I recognized there was some kind of problem but had no real idea what I was doing wrong.  Had a pretty bad mental health breakdown 2 years ago and left my job about 14 months ago.  Haven't tried to find a new gig until now.

Now I want to transition to managing a small to medium team of some kind of computer nerds.  Hopefully developers.  I have a strong technical base so I can easily pick up enough about whatever job my team is doing.  Enough that I can probably be a help to them fairly quickly.

But I want/need things to be different with coworker relationships.  I've learned enough about ASD now to understand I'm going to have to put effort and thought into building relationships.  Which means the dreaded small talk and all that.

So, after over explaining all the above, here's my question(s) to anyone with Aspergers who is managing people.  How much effort do you actually put into getting to know your peers?  Do you force yourself to stop at the coffee machine and initiate conversations?  Do you have any tips on how you navigate the world at work?

Also, does anyone have any good suggestions on leadership books I should read or free/cheap training I could take to help me out when I interview?

1pux7pj,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeMoneyInUK/comments/1pux7pj/caffè_nero_free_barista_prepared_drink_after/,Caffè Nero | Free Barista Prepared Drink after First Purchase,"Caffè Nero | Free Barista Prepared Drink after First Purchase

New Caffe Nero app customers can get a free barista prepared hot drink following their first purchase using the Caffè Nero app (scanning the app when paying).

I go for the hot chocolate as I don’t like coffee and £2.50ish for a cup of tea is ridiculous!

You may also receive a voucher for a free cake on your birthday. Unsure if a previous purchase is required but each year they send me a voucher.

——————————

Steps:

•	⁠Register an account.

•	⁠Visit a Caffè Nero store, purchase a drink, and scan the app when paying.

•	⁠Your free drink voucher should appear in the app. Go to the “wallet” section then “vouchers”.

•	⁠To redeem your free drink ask the server to pay using the app. They will invite you to scan the voucher QR code.

——————————

Scan the app each time you purchase a hot drink to earn a stamp (or 2 stamps if using a reusable cup). Once 9 stamps have been awarded you will automatically receive a voucher for a hot drink or iced drink (any-size) for free. Speciality Drinks and Extras are also included.

Pro tip, you only get 1 stamp per drinks order (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 stamps (or 4 if using reusable cups).

Really we just want to soak in the neighborhood character and get a feel for how your city breathes, even on a quiet holiday. We’re totally okay with slow and simple.

If you have a favorite spot you’d go on a chill Christmas Day, or even just a nice walk you’d recommend, we’d love to hear it.

1pux3g0,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1pux3g0/small_christmas_rant/,Small Christmas Rant,"My mom is very self centered and one of the ways I am reminded every year is My mom gives terrible gifts. It's a known fact and you'd think with almost 30 years of Christmas with her I would have my expectations set, yet somehow she found a way to disappoint even still. 

You might say it's the thought that counts but that just it , she puts no thought or time into actually buying a gift. Every year it's like she went shopping for a complete stranger. Weird plastic phone accessories, coffee cups, and socks. 

The worst offenders being the last of the list. If I had a dollar for every time I've said to her ""I hate socks"" you'd have enough to buy an actual good gift. For 30 years I have said it time and time again. So much so we even have a family joke that you can tell it's really cold outside if I've actually put on socks. 

It's not even a matter of cost because there are dozens of things you could get at the dollar store I would genuinely be interested in getting. Heck I even specifically asked her for an item from the dollar store this year ( kitchen tongs).

And yet come today my family opens gifts on Christmas Eve. And lo and behold- socks. I even checked the tag thinking I must have opened the wrong gift but no. Dollar store Betty boop socks tag still attached. I couldn't help but look at her in confusion and she's said oh yah I thought you'd like those.

I shrugged and moved on but the thing that sent me over the edge was the gift she got my son. He's 11mo so this is his first Christmas. Most my family were very thoughtful in getting small age appropriate gifts. My grandfather even refinished a small rocking chair from my childhood for him.

She gifted him a block toy clearly labeled 3y+ since it has small choking hazards. I gently showed her the choking hazard notice and she just shrugged and said she didn't see that when she bought it. Further it was a branded toy that I had also previously mentioned we weren't planing on letting him watch that show. But she ""forgot"" of course.

I'm hit with the realization that even for only grandson that has anything to do with her. For all her talking and cooing about him. Even for him she can't think about anyone but herself. It's not even the thought because there wasn't any, there never has been.

It's not new for me- but still a disappointment nonetheless. ",3,1766609617.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False
1pux2sv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pux2sv,Ground Floor Redesign Feedback,"Hi All!

First time posting here. We are embarking on our first home purchase and going through the exercise with an architect on the floorplan redesign. First pic is the existing plan, second is two takes on the new design.

A little context, the building is a semi detached triplex ( left wall is shared ) with two apartments above ( access from outside directly into an interior staircase ). This is the ground floor apartment with a finished basement. There is a second bathroom and laundry room in the basement.

The plans are actually in french, but pretty straight forward ""Salon"" is living room. ""Chambre"" is bedroom. ""Salle de Bain"" is bathroom. ""Cuisine"" is kitchen. ""Salle a manger"" is dining room.

Other details: the Living room is actually a sunken room ( step-down room ). Old school but we dig it. That little shape in the entrance of that room is actually a planter. Cool but we would get rid of it.

Obvious criticism of the new plan:

\- Vestibule sucks. We live in a cold climate and there is no mud room to take off boots and coats. Would have to take space from the first bedroom which is not ideal. Big front window is a problem for that.

\- Bathroom opens to dining room and kitchen. Not ideal either. We have the second bathroom downstairs if guests have a more permanent dropoff but still..

Let me know your thoughts! Not sure where to go from here.

EDIT: Other detail: In the new design, the counter between the living room and the kitchen would be a see-through opening so that we can keep an eye on the little one/serve cocktails to guests while we cook in the kitchen. Probably have the coffee machine corner there too. There would be stools on the living room side so people can hang out. Probably have that opening be an arch to soften and as a design element",1,1766609563.0,floorplan,6,1.0,False

1pux2bc,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1pux2bc/your_house_blend_a_thought/,Your House Blend (a thought),"We started brick and mortar about a decade ago. Day one, we were pourovers and espresso, and whole bean coffee. No batch brew. No sugar. No “flavorings.” No decaf. No blends. Single origins. Snobs.

Within the first week we realized “you have to have decaf because some of your customers can not have caffeine and you can’t have a community if you allow 3 people to come in your doors and one of them can’t get a drink that’s entirely reasonable to want from a roastery.

As the rational here can guess, within weeks, we realized we were way up our own asses and needed to appeal to the reality of coffee drinkers. Started working on our latte program, etc. 

A whole lot of “wake the F up, you nerds.” All of it for the better. But we were still single origin only, because we were exploring and our region had no access to the kinds of things we were doing, so they were exploring alongside us.

Then COVID, and now a lot of our beverage customers are buying bags of roasted coffee and making it at home… and they struggle because their grinders suck or their equipment sucks, or their approach sucks… we need an “easy button” coffee. Something not cutting-edge of light, or of fruity, or whatever. Something that will taste like “our coffee” no matter how you make it. It was almost an emergency product. 

As you could guess, it became very popular and remains so, to this day. A blend that we never intended. And I had to recently consider “why is this more popular than ‘finer’ coffees we have on offer?” And I think it’s actually simple.

It’s reps. 

If you have ANY quality focus and testing, even if (and it’s hopefully not) it’s an afterthought compared to your best coffees, over the years that blend is going to get more staff scrutiny than anything else you offer. You’re going to roast more of it than anything else, because your SO’s are seasonal, and your blend concept contains seasonal coffees, but is a process that goes year round. If you give 100% attention to your Natural Ethiopian, and 60% attention to your house blend, throughout the year you will still end up putting an order of magnitude more dev time in on the blend. More cupping, more QA testing, more careful roast re-thinking, etc. 

This is, IMO why every shop should have a house blend, eventually if not even right away. Because that’s a spot where it makes sense to have a thumbprint. It should never be swill, IMO it should never be lower quality coffee to try to make extra profit. It should be specialty blenders, and components from your SO offer sheet, built to serve a specific taste. For us it’s a multitasker for espresso and drip—it’s not constantly even used on bar—just in rotation—we still do a ton of SOs for batch and spro. 

But this is absolutely a factor in us surviving both COVID and recent market instability. Something I would recommend considering, for anyone looking to open commercially.",8,1766609525.0,roasting,0,0.83,False

1pux1qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pux1qs/friend_cant_afford_to_pay/,Friend can’t afford to pay,"A group of us, gay men in our 50s-60s in NYC, plan things like dinners and Broadway shows. One person pays, and the rest Venmo him. It’s worked very well for years.  

One friend has had to downsize recently. No shame there, but he still accepts group invitations that can cost $300. Then when the bill comes, he stays silent and so either the guy w the credit card pays or we all chip in. I have paid for him twice. 

He has been a friend for years. I told him I would be happy to have a coffee or a beer with him, and I have, and we talk and text. But he has got to stop accepting these invitations. 

He says he’ll pay us back when he can. Which is what they all say.  He clearly is afraid of being dropped from the group. 

So this happened last weekend. He showed up at a XMas dinner at a restaurant. I did not invite him. It was my turn to pay w the credit card, so I told the waiter he would need a separate check. Management said they could not accommodate that, given the size of our party and how busy the place was.  So I ordered for the friend, to keep costs down. He said he was humiliated. I said he gave up being humiliated when he showed up expecting free food and booze. 

There is nothing that old gay men like more than hot drama, so this reverberated through the table like, well, like hot drama. Most said they would have just paid for him. 

So, while friends did not think I was the A, they kind of thought it was A-adjacent. 

So: was I A-adjacent?  Sorry, but I would never have done what he did. ",12,1766609479.0,AITAH,31,0.93,False

1puwxog,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1puwxog/long_read_about_mixed_signals/,Long read about Mixed Signals,"This girl (F21) and I (M21) were dating for 3 weeks, and we are undergraduate students with the same major, so we see each other a lot outside of the dates we went on. We met on a dating app, where it said she was ‘still figuring out what she wants’. During those 3 weeks, we had one real date at night, and both had a really good time. 

We learned we had a ton of things in common and definitely shared a lot of interests. I learned she has one of the busiest schedules i have ever seen, including weekends, and that finding a time to go on dates would be a challenge, but i was okay with that. I also learned she had been on a couple dates before me, that went horribly wrong, which told me she probably wasn’t seeing anyone else. I also learned that she was in a 3 year long relationship with someone that ended recently, and on bad terms. She called him toxic for ignoring her for days on end occasionally. Furthermore, she shared with me that her dad had cheated on her mom while she was with this guy, and it was a big trauma for her that made her classify cheating as something she will never tolerate in her partner, I agreed. 

Eventually, things were going really well, but not escalating. No kisses, hugs, hand holds, or anything, just hanging out after class as it was really the only time we could meet. Also strangely, she made a consistent effort to pay for as many things as she could –reservations for our date, drinks, parking, etc. I told her it wasnt necessary to pay for everything because it was my treat, and she said it was no big deal to her. When I did buy her a drink one time, she even venmod me for it afterward! Weird detail, but anyways, a week after our first date she invited me to her house to watch a movie, but she had to cancel the day before due to a late-night research request from a professor. Unfortunate, but at least it told me she was comfortable with me and was looking for something more.

A couple of coffee dates later, and she eventually asked to ‘come smoke in my room’ one night, but it didnt work out for other reasons on my part. I could tell she was really warming up to me by the way she initiated a lot of text conversations, complimented me on my instagram posts, and consistently said I smelled good. 3 weeks in, I decided that things needed to pick up pace just a little, and I surprised her with her favorite snack to munch on while we studied. She didnt eat a single chip despite saying 2 minutes earlier how hungry she was. She also remained pretty quiet for the remainder of the study session. 

Unexpectedly, the next morning she texted me saying she isnt ready for serious relationship and just wants to be friends. I asked her why, and she said she really enjoyed spending time with me, she thought i was wonderful, but that she saw her ex and realized she definitely still had feelings for him and needed to figure her own shit out before starting something with someone else. She wrote quite a long text actually about how she doesnt think its fair to me based on where shes at mentally with everything about her dad and her toxic ex. I said I understand, and wished her well. 

I saw her later that same day at an event for students in our major, and she seemed like she was hyper social, talking to anyone and everyone, including me, pretending like nothing even happened. I wasnt really in the mood to socialize, so I left early. The next day she saw me in class and asked where I went last night, and I told her I had a stomach ache and left early.

We went about a week with just the occasional ‘hi’ in class, because I wanted her to know I wasnt bitter or resentful. One day she even passed by me studying alone and stopped to tell me that she ‘smelled Owen when she walked in here’ (me) with a big smile, but then quickly said ‘but dont take that the wrong way :)’. Occasionally I would see her looking at me during class, and then darting away when I looked at her back. Eventually, I tried to show her that I still wanted to be friends by asking to sit with her at the tables outside of our classroom to study (since there were no empty tables otherwise) which we did many times when we were dating, and she said sure. 

I told her she was assigned as my partner for an upcoming psychology research project, and she said ‘haha yeah that professor is trying to set us up, but I just dont have time for a boyfriend...sorry haha’. I realized after that one study session that spending alone time with her after class was not a smart idea and was making it much harder to move on, so one day I decided to not sit with her, and when she passed me to use the bathroom, she lightheartedly asked what I was doing, so I just told her I had a ton of work to do. I couldn‘t tell if she was bothered by my decision to not sit with her, or if she just was really locked into her laptop, but she seemed a little conserved after that (Or i was just imagining it…idk). Towards the end of the quarter, she started initiating a lot of conversations in person, and even broke our ‘no text’ streak following her decision to be friends. She texted me trying to make light conversation when she saw me studying across the room, or just minding my own business on campus. At one point, she texted me while I was waiting for a professor in their office, asking what I was doing. I made a light joke about the professor being late, and she ‘loved’ my text message. We got to talking, and she realized I was sick with a cold by the fact that I was constantly getting up to get tissues. The next couple of days when I would see her or be texting her, she would end the conversations with, ‘I hope you feel better!’. 

One day, the study room was somewhat full, and I was at a small, 4 person table with 2 girls I didnt know, minding our own business. She texted me to let her in because she forgot her access card, and I made my way back to my seat, and she sat right next to me, despite there being many other options to sit at. We talked about some gossip within our class, about our projects, and spent a solid 30 minutes just talking about life, which was mostly school related anyways. I had to leave to meet with a professor across the hall, and this professor (who was the one trying to set us up) kept leaving to ask this girl for some research information, but told me to tag along. While her and the professor were talking I said basically nothing, but she made an effort to look at me when answering the professor’s questions about our research the whole 10 minute long conversation.

I saw her once more before leaving for the winter break, where she showed up to an undergrad potluck for no more than 2 minutes, walked over to me, asked if I had eaten already (I had) made another comment about recognizing my smell, then said she realized she wasnt hungry and just left.

I know this is kind of a long winded story with a lot of important and not-so-important details, but I’m really trying to illustrate the chemistry and dynamic that shifted over the last 6 weeks. I know she at least liked me when we were going out, and I want to think she still has feelings for me, but I’m not great at interpreting women or figuring out what she wants. When she initially sent the text asking to be friends, it sucked, especially considering how much I liked her, but I was preparing myself to move on at that point.

Maybe I’m misreading this whole thing, but I still have feelings for her, and I want to know if she is warming up to me again, if she still needs a lot more time, or if I am being too optimistic. My friends say that girls dont just do or say these things for guys they want to ‘just be friends with’, but that also girls will be intentional if they want something more.

I would really appreciate some wisdom, insight, or just straight advice. Thanks!

TLDR: This girl I was dating for 3 weeks asked to be friends despite things going well because she still had feelings for her toxic ex and wasnt ready for another serious relationship, but her actions do not match what she asked for, and it left me confused and conflicted going into winter break.

1puwx77,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/1puwx77/how_do_i_find_my_people/,"How do I find ""my people""?","I am in my junior year of college. I go to a pretty big school, and I am in a small sorority. I feel like I am pretty well connected around campus. I have a lot of acquaintance-level friends that I will occasionally go out and get coffee with, or we will fun into each other at a party and talk for a while. I have friends in my sorority too, and I don't think anyone dislikes me. I feel like I would have heard about it if they did. But they don't really go out of their way to include me in things. They have always had group chats without me, no matter how much time I spend with them. It feels like they like me, and they let me tag along with them if I ask, but I have never really been part of the group. I am not sure why.

I tried to make friends outside of my sorority, thinking maybe they aren't my people. I joined a mental health advocacy club (I am a psych major) but there were these two girls there who seemed like they were going out of their way to exclude me. Whenever I'd say anything, they'd side eye each other. They'd make plans and invite someone else in front of me but not me. And again, they'd let me tag along if I asked but there was no organic invitation.

I have had a few friend groups over the past few years that have disbanded for various reasons. Usually, we find out that one person in the group is a really awful person. Usually there is drama that never really involves me but the group still splits because of it.

I also feel like it is important for me to include that I think I may be on the high-functioning end of the ASD spectrum. I have always struggled with social cues. I try and ask people for feedback subtly to make sure I'm not doing anything weird.  I can be pretty independent and I am somewhat of an introvert so social interaction is pretty exhausting for me. I can't spend more than a few hours with most people without getting annoyed or tired. I have considered that maybe this is why I don't have a lot of close friends. I am also pretty confident in myself and I am not very insecure, and I think this throws some people off.

In conclusion, I do have friends, but I wish I had more close ones that think about me like I think about them. I hope this makes sense. If you've made it to the end of my long post, thank you for reading. I'd love if you had any feedback for me. I am not trying to vent, I guess I just want to share my experience and see if anyone else relates or has any advice on how to find ""your people."" thanks.",1,1766609105.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

1puwo8n,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/1puwo8n/is_this_normal_behavior_at_work/,Is this normal behavior at work?,"I’ve had some bad experiences at work with some managers and often have asked myself if I’m the issue or the managers. Most of the time I’ve blamed myself for it but after rethinking some stuff I genuinely wonder if the problem was really me. These are some examples of things I’ve gone through at work:

1. I used to work as a cashier at a local store. I had a colleague who once strangled a high school girl in front of the register because that girl didn’t know that you can’t walk with a group of high school students inside the shop. She paid for her stuff and was leaving the shop but my colleague ended up creating a fight and pulled on the girl’s backpack and when the girl got mad my colleague ended up strangling her to the ground. Literally everyone who was standing at the register witnessed this and they all said that my colleague was the real problem here. My manager ended up running after the girls and taking pictures of them. The parents of those girls came to the shop and fought with the manager and told her that they’re going to take this to the police. My manager ended up blaming this entire incident on me. According to her I was the bad person here because I didn’t click on the bell for help. I told her that I clicked four times on the bell and no one came. It was my third week at work and I was taken a back by this incident. All my other colleagues took my side. But my manager was extremely mean to me all those months I worked there. She made issues of the smallest things and my mom begged me to quit the job because I had just gotten into med school and my mom was scared that my manager might frame me for something stupid like “stealing” stuff from the shop in order to kick me out of the job. But this whole thing truly did something with my self confidence because I really was putting my all into this job and this was the way I got treated. 

2. I used to work as a customer service support at an energy company. I came on time every day, usually 10 minutes before everyone else. I did all my assignments on time. I had a manager who had something against me. According to him, I had dark eye circles and that was a big topic during our work feedback meeting. He told me that people like me bring problems to work and he didn’t like the way I was at work because I kept things to myself and I wasn’t very social. This was my first real job and I didn’t think any of his words were wrong but looking back at it I still find it strange how everyone else in the team got normal feedback related to work but no one got feedback on their appearance. I mean I’m south asian and naturally have some hyperpigmentation under my eyes and I don’t wear makeup to cover that because it ain’t that big of a deal. But for some reason it was a big deal for my manager. He would even call me during my off days to talk shit about the way I worked instead of during my work days. One time I came late around 20 minutes past the normal time because my bus was cancelled so I had to walk to the station. I sent a message to my manager explaining that I was coming late to work but I will work 20 minutes past my normal curfew in order to catch up on those missed minutes. I thought it was a good way to manage the problem but when I came to work, my manager screamed in front of everyone else and said that I should’ve apologized while coming in. I thought that sending a message and apologizing and managing the situation was a good way to handle it but apparently it wasn’t in his eyes. This was such an awkward and embarrassing situation in front of my colleagues and it truly put me off from the work place. I ended up leaving the work after three months and I got low self esteem. 

3. I had a recent job at a hospital. I was working this summer as a secretary for the nursing department at an eye hospital. I’m in med school so during summer break I like to gain some work experience. At the hospital most colleagues use paper cups at the coffee machine. I’m someone who reuses the paper cup instead of throwing it away. For instance, if I know I’m going to get another cup of chocolate milk then I won’t throw away the cup but refill it because absolutely bullshit to keep on using a new cup if you can just refill it. I had a colleague who made a huge deal of this. While I went to the toilet she threw away my cup because according to her I’m a messy person. I was taken a back by the fact that she did this while I was away in the washroom even though she had the whole day to say something to me. Then one hour later, another colleague was very negative to me while I came back from the toilet. I had the feeling that every time I was away my colleagues were shit talking about me. And guess what? It’s been two months since I’ve heard from work. I think I’ve basically been fired. 

I’ve done a lot of self reflection and I kept on blaming myself for it because these things have often happened to me. I talked to my father who is a doctor and to my bf who is also in med school and they get the feeling that a lot has to do with stigma against women in the medical field because people mostly expect a guy to be a doctor and can’t stand it if a woman takes that role in the future. I don’t completely buy this because with that logic every single female med student would’ve a similar experience but that’s not the case. Another thing they pointed out was that I’m an introvert and not everyone likes introverts. 

I was wondering if people here know what kind of behavior are off putting at work that makes someone not like you and if these experiences I had are considered normal or not. ",1,1766608382.0,careerguidance,2,1.0,False

I recently bought this pair from the Fellow drop a few weeks ago, mostly because [they recommended a hot chocolate au lait recipe](https://fellowproducts.com/blogs/brew-talks/fellows-take-on-ritual-x-dandelion-brew-recipe) and I’m a fan of making au laits.

I like the coffee, it’s juicy (even as an au lait by itself). But when I tried the hot chocolate au lait recipe I really hated it, it severely diluted both the flavor of the coffee and the flavor of the chocolate. It makes me wonder if they even tasted it, lol. I’m curious to know if anyone else has tried this combination and liked the result? Did you do anything differently?

I do kinda like it if I make the coffee with just a splash of frothed milk and a little bit (maybe half a teaspoon) of the chocolate on top as a garnish. The flavors go better together when the chocolate/peppermint is really more of an added note than a strong element. Curious what you think, if you’ve tried it.

(If it matters, I made the coffee in an aeropress using the Hoffmann recipe more or less exactly. I also tried making it in my Kalita wave using Fellow’s recipe for the Stagg. 60 clicks on Kingrinder K0 for the aeropress, 100 clicks for the wave.)

**Act I. - Giallo**

***Chapter 1: Gehenna at*** ***the Crossroads***

Like a behemoth, a chrome-plated 18-wheeler rolls along the grainy asphalt, steering towards the dark night. Few vehicles circle around the giant, dwarfed by its mere presence of massive steel, aluminum and diesel. 

Liam has seen this same spectacle for longer than he can remember; he's been doing this job for 30 years, maybe longer. A real trucker, son of the routes. How many dawns has he seen breaking across the plains? How many nights has he crossed beneath the watchful glow of indifferent stars? An endless cycle - birth, death, rebirth - a procession framed by the dancing lights of the celestial bodies above and the headlights below.  

His body aches like old machinery, the kind of pain that doesn’t fade once you notice it, yet he is grateful that it still obeys him. The years have not been kind. The road doesn’t allow kindness. It keeps him moving. That is enough. This passion turns him into a vagabond, a man without a home, always traveling the same monotonous trail, divided by the same alternating lines. Blank and white, blank and white, blank and white. His family has long since come to terms with his absence. Once, his wife would wait up late, keeping a lamp burning by the window. Not anymore. He noticed, but never asked. His daughter calls sometimes - brief, polite, fading like radio static; the only firm bond he has with them is his travel companion, the Papillon dog that his daughter gave him for his 46th birthday. The little critter snores softly, unbothered by the endless motion. 

Blank and white.  

Simonetti, the company for which he transports the lines in the hold, is going to close. He is sure of that. Fewer and fewer trucks are pulling their trailers behind them like ploughing oxen, fewer men still loyal to the fleet, something he has been able to observe well over the past year. The sewage scandal has probably given them the final death blow, he doesn't know exactly, though truthfully the rot had been festering long before. The competition from Asia is too great, the industry in the region has been in the gutter for decades. 

“The gutter...” Liam murmurs, chuckling under his breath. 

“We’re all gonna reach that place, won't we?” He mutters as he reaches out to run his hand through his sleeping dog's fur.  

“The old South ain’t no longer what it used to be—crime, scum and poverty, we have enough of that here.” He shifts lanes, headlights sweeping over the wet asphalt. He has changed too many in his life, yet he never finds the right one. “Maybe I should retire just like ol’ Simonetti, don't you think, Charlie? Or else this job might bury me six feet under. Heh.” He rolls the window to the side, the strong wind blowing through his gray mustache and the thinning hair under his shabby cap. 

Cold air blows against his aged skin, tugging at his shirt and hitting his ear. He smells the humidity of the region, the earthy scent of the greenery after the rain, the pungent odor of asphalt and diesel—the sweetness of the magnolia trees alongside the stench of industry. That is the confirmation he needs to know that he is still alive and kicking. Despite everything. 

He laughs softly, the sound swallowed by the growl of the engine. 

   
“Come on, ol’ buddy,” he says, patting the dog as it stirs. 

   
“Once we drop this load, we’ll get something real good to eat. I promise ya.” 

He turns the steering wheel when he sees the roadway under the large sign. ‘Port Sulphur’, his lane. 

Weeks since he’s seen his wife. Months since his daughter. That will change, he tells himself. It has to.  

Experienced and steady, he slows down the vehicle and drives into the entrance of a truck stop. A quiet, lonely place. A black truck stands at the edge of the driveway like a sleeping giant from another age. Two Fords, a sleek vintage Cadillac, and an Arch motorcycle are orderly parked next to the gas pumps.  

Liam parks, cuts the ignition, and sits for a moment in the hush that follows. He exhales, unbuckles his seatbelt, and opens the door with a wide jerk. Charlie lifts his head and yawns, revealing his gaping throat and curling tongue. “Come on buddy, let’s stretch our legs.” 

The trucker marches toward the restaurant with his sleepy mutt in tow, gravel crunching with every step. The large windows cast a warm, shimmering light on the uneven ground of the gas station. A flickering red neon sign hangs at the entrance, ‘EAT HERE’ welcoming the pilgrim from afar. He fastens his companion's collar next to a bowl of water and opens the glass door.  

A small jingling bell overhead signals his entry into the familiar new environment. The restaurant is decorated in a retro 1950s style – faded checkered tiles, a Coke machine dulled by years of grease and dust. Vintage advertising tin plates hanging on the walls, red bar stools whose leather surfaces were cracked and bore the imprints of countless strangers' buttocks. Peeling chrome trim on furniture, and an out of order Jukebox, reminiscent of America's golden age. 

The old man sits down at the counter and taps the service bell. The sharp ding! rings out, echoing long. A constant and loud hissing sound comes from the kitchen; he glances at the menu - the selection is big, but the decision is made quickly. He rings again. ""Hey, don’t keep me waiting for too long!"" No answer, just the persistent sizzling of boiling fat.  

He looks around, observing the other seats in the room. Most of them are empty, but a few are tabled with plates and cutlery. Full and half-full plates with sliced steaks, half-portions of fries, glasses of soda with ice long melted, or sandwiches missing a few bites. The food is already cold, and the only guests enjoying the meals are a dozen buzzing flies. 

An abandoned wallet full of cash lies on a table. Liam’s gut tightens. He puts his feet on the floor, his boots squeaking faintly on the tile. The air feels thicker near the counter; the smell of grease sharpens by something sour. He steps around the bar, leaning toward the kitchen doorway. He can still hear the monotonous crackling of cooking. 

Just as he steps forward, he hears a loud crack. He looks down at shattered porcelain. The white panes contrast sharply with the black puddle of coffee they lie in. In the middle, a silver pot with a large dent lies like a corpse at a crime scene. 

“H- hello? Is... is anybody there?” He asks, keeping his voice down, unsure of the situation. The hissing disappeares, only a hoarse whistling sounds, which grows louder with every step towards the kitchen - a horrible, pungent smell of iron; burnt meat wafts up his nose. The sudden flow of water accompanies the whistling. He follows the sound, each step slower than the last. The white tiles ahead glisten wetly under the bright fluorescent light. 

Then he sees it - the first smear of what could only be blood. Thick, dark, dragged across the floor like a crude brushstroke. More follows, a thick trail leading from one corner of the kitchen to the other. One wall, next to which a thick puddle had formed, is heavily damaged, cracked, smeared, and riddled with holes. Patterns only violence could draw. 

He rounds the corner. And stops breathing. A lifeless body lies face-down on the grill, the hotplate glowing red. The skin is blistered and blackened, smoke curling off it in slow ribbons. The trail goes deeper, leading into the cold storage room. There, a mountain of stacked corpses awaits him: customers, waiters, employees, young, old. Faces frozen mid-scream, ashen and split.  

Liam staggers back, knocking over a metal pan that clatters to the floor. The noise draws movement. His gaze falls to the sink. Tall, slender, clad head to toe in tight black rubber that gleams under the pale light, chains and pins protruding from the anonymous costume. The humanoid figure’s back is turned, gloved hands moving rhythmically under the faucet. Pink water swirls into the drain.  

Then the figure turns. It stares at the trembling man with wide, glassy eyes, those of an animal, a demon in blood rage. The figure pulls out a long bladed bayonet. He doesn’t move. His lungs locked. He sits there on the floor, not daring to take his eyes away from the nightmarish visual. They remain interlocked like that for seconds until the figure takes one, then two steps away from the sink, prompting the trucker to jump to his feet and hurl himself out of the kitchen with all his might. 

The man-beast follows and leaps at him from behind the counter, landing on him, the long blade flashing. Liam holds the bayonet by the cutting edges from his neck with one hand and hammers the attacker's ribs with the other. The weapon slides through his sliced palm and flies down. Liam moves to the side, the point pierces his shoulder. The old man screams, his dog barks from outside. He grabs the dented silver can from the floor next to him and smashes it on the butcher's head, knocking him off his body and jumping back up.  

The old man runs down the diner's aisle toward the exit. A shrill whirring fills the air. A window bursts to his righten side. He feels warm, thick blood flowing down his arm like a fountain. Something tears past his head, biting into the wall. He throws himself to the ground. Lying on his stomach, he pushes himself forward, hastily pushing chairs and tables out of the way with his free arm. Above him, much more whirring and shattering resounds, as if hornets were descending on him at sonic speed. Large holes burst into the furniture above. Splinters and shards rain over him, tearing fabric and skin.  

As suddenly as it began, the shooting stops. He reaches the entrance. He listens. Silence, only his heart hammering like a jackhammer. The latex shape is nowhere to be seen.  

He wipes his face with his palms, not noticing that they are already smeared with his wounds, leaving dull streaks across his cheeks and eyes. The diner is a mess, the previously clean floor is littered with debris and blood, the furniture torn and scattered wildly around. Cola gurgles from a hole in the soda machine. It pools and spreads, sticky and black. He sits. Forgets why. Breath in. Too fast. Slower. The soda keeps spilling. 

After a while, he slowly climbs up, reaches his shaking hand towards the handle, and opens the door. The bell chimes—a cruel parody of farewell—and he stumbles into the open air, gasping, clutching his torn flesh.  

With all his strength, he pushes through and sprints into the darkness across the invisible gravel. Tears stream from his eyes; his hand pressed to the gunshot wound. He whimperes, squeezes his eyes shut. He would run, run as far as his legs would carry him; his survival instinct driven by the memories of his wife, of his daughter’s small hands, the thought of Charlie left behind.  

God. 

A deep, tearing pain penetrates his intestines. Blooming, burning, final. He opens his eyes and stares into two others. Two empty voids. He lowers his gaze and sees a long hunting knife in the hand of a black leather glove — the blade buried beneath his navel in the middle of a dark blot on his tattered shirt. The hand withdraws, taking the knife with it. The long blade reveals itself as a rusty red, almost bronze, but this is difficult to discern due to the spurting crimson gore.  

Liam falls. The gravel rushes up to meet him. The world fades to black. 

Across the street, in the tangled, muddy underbush, a vagrant wades by, as a small fire breaks out in the pitch-black diner. The hermit watches as the fire ignites and grows larger, a thin thread shooting towards the gas pumps. Crawling and licking, the flames erupt into a column of orange and white. Through the inferno, shapes hang upside down - silhouettes crucified in the fire’s hungry glow. Among them, the old trucker. 

As the first new customers arrive, the boiling bodies are brightly engulfed in greedily blazing flames and turned into charred phantoms, their lipless smiles shining through. Within no time, the gas station explodes in a giant fireball, a massive holocaust whose heat melts tires and blisters the paint on the trucks further away. The vagrant takes an apple from his pocket, cuts himself a piece, nibbles on it, and retreats back into the woods. 

When twilight breaks, there is nothing left but ash, twisted metal, and a single object lying in front of the soot—wrapped neatly in yellow wrapping paper.

In around a month of using dating apps, I’ve matched with a decent amount of women but most of them are really dry or don’t even respond.

This one girl I met on bumble was really good at texting. We moved to WhatsApp and we would call and text a lot (she seemed to want to do this so I matched her energy). We went on one date and she seemed really into me, with compliments and body language. She said she wanted to go on another date within the next few days. We planned a second date but she cancelled due to illness. We spoke that day and the next, then didn’t respond to my messages for a few days after. I messaged her asking if I had done something wrong, and she replied saying she was a bit down after job issues but still wanted to talk and that she was sorry for not responding. She said she had never done that before.

We spoke again for another week or so, with quite deep chats. We got to know each other pretty well. We last spoke on Friday, where she was going to let me know if she was free Saturday as she was seeing her mum, or whether we would be meeting Sunday. I messaged her Saturday asking if she was free, with no reply. I then messaged her one more time on Sunday, saying we can go for coffee if she wanted to and for her to at least let me know as she did this last time.

There has been no reply and she has not read the messages. She has also unmatched me on Bumble.

This is one of the Jansons I’ve especially enjoyed more this year — an incredible floral bomb; like a bouquet of white flowers in a cup.

Jasmine, magnolia, chamomile with a green tea finish.

I think this one might be slightly more developed (by no means dark) than the other Janson/ Panamanian Geishas I’ve had this year and it’s so interesting to taste this expression. It is less delicate and tea like, with “bolder” flavor intensity with a heavier mouthfeel and good clarity/ structure.

My Canto 10 predictions.","Very soon, we'll be diving headfirst into Ryoshi's personal drama. However, along with that, we'll get hints about what awaits our beloved Frenchman. My patience has failed me, so I've read Camus's original work and now ready to share some interesting facts and insights with you, so you can discover them with me.

I'll start with two of the most pressing themes:

Meursault and distortion.

Throughout the novel, Meursault describes his actions, feelings, and surroundings in detail. He especially frequently mentions the sun and heat. Heat is mentioned in almost every chapter (even in the courtroom), but it haunts Meursault least of all in his prison cell. Sun, however, follow him everywhere. As many know, the sun is associated with Carmen in the game's universe. Therefore, it's safe to assume that the Frenchman felt her influence throughout all the key events. Whether he still feels that influence remains to be seen. It's reasonable to believe that Meursault could have become distorted shortly before killing the Arab. The sun was blinding and the heat unbearable. However, distortion requires a mental breakdown. This is precisely what happened at the end of the novel, during a conversation with the priest in prison. Meursault was displeased by the uninvited guest's words; for the first time in the novel, the protagonist not only felt intense anger but also let it out. In those same moments, Meursault's worldview changed. Before the priest's arrival, he had cherished the hope of a pardon, plotting what would happen if he would be killed or not. But afterward, he was completely purged of both hope and despair. He became like a world - essentially indifferent. What interrupted Meursault's distortion? Perhaps it was himself. As in the book, Meursault could simply accept his death as an inevitable fact. In his words, he was and remains a happy man.

Bad-end Identity.

Meursault has two clear paths for his worst self: becoming a full-fledged member of society and judging people not by their actions but by their moral character, or morally embracing the role of the ""antichrist,"" a murderer. Either way, I'm sure his canto will be dedicated to tremor. Tremor is associated with the sin of sloth, and, oh my, the book hero fits it perfectly. In the novel, he spent the entire Sunday after the funeral in his apartment: sleeping until noon, wandering around the rooms, refusing to go out for bread, looking out the window, reading the newspaper, smoking, and falling asleep. Until he's pulled by someone, he won't move. The same goes for his social interactions. Interestingly, we have two anomalies related to judgment: Heavenly Commander's Scribe and Heavenly Executor's Scribe. Perhaps we'll get a Heavenly Judge's Scribe anomaly? If Meursault will has all three of yhem, it would be interesting to create a synergy between them and his bad-end identity. Also, the sound of the judge's gavel strikingly resembles a tremor!

Morality?

Frankly, I don't know how the novel's moral component will interact with the events of the game. In the City, Meursault's actions wouldn't have stirred anyone. The City, if not immoral, indifferent by nature. Perhaps Meursault actually did the right thing, and that's his crime?

Now for something simple: interesting facts!

1. The book's hero has had several women throughout his life. The last one is his girlfriend Mari, whom he doesn't love, but isn't opposed to marrying if that's what she wants. The girl loves Meursault, despite his oddity, and testified for him in court. He thought about her in prison, even in the heat of anger. What if she's Carmen?
2. In prison, Meursault lamented the imperfections of execution, particularly the guillotine, since it doesn't give the condemned a chance for survive. He imagined pills as better option. It would kill a person with a 9 in 10 chance. If the person survived, they would be released. Perhaps that 1 in 10 chance was the Limbus Company.
3. The prosecutor may be the main villain of the canto. It was he who convinced the jury that the defendant was evil, undeserving of pity. He went so far as to say all this ""in the name of the french people"" and even directly named Meursault as the perpetrator of another crime – parricide. The court was scheduled to hear this case the next day. The N-Ryoshu story said that the director of N-Corp is a charismatic orator who fanned the flames of persecution against people with prosthetics. Perhaps it was them who turned people against Meursault? Hello, Hermann!
4. Meursault was a smoker. During imprisonment, he gave up smoking, as it was prohibited. He accepted it as a form of punishment. Who knows, maybe after the canto he'll take up smoking again, as if free man.
5. Meursault loves coffee with milk and collects funny newspaper clippings.
6. Meursault worked for a transport company. His boss offered him a transfer to a new branch in Paris, but Meursault didn't care. He was doing just fine there. No ambitions. By the way, his boss is a strict man. The prospect of letting an employee attend a funeral on Thursday and Friday bothered him. Furthermore, he didn't allow phone calls in the office for personal matters.
7. In the novel, Meursault periodically wants to apologize or say, ""It's not my fault,"" at inappropriate moments. His most common response to everything is ""I don't care.""
8. During lunch at a café, a strange woman-automaton with dog sat down at Meursault's table (he said so himself). She frantically flipped through the menu, ordered all the dishes at once, counted out the money and tip, and placed them on the table. When the appetizers arrived, she quickly ate them and began flipping through the TV listings, checking off all the programs. After the meal, she left as strangely as she had arrived. Meursault followed her out of curiosity, but lost her. Even stranger, she was summoned to the trial as a witness, even though she had only met the defendant briefly. Her speech is not quoted in the novel. She and one of the journalists gazed intently at Meursault. Who knows, maybe she'll be one of Demian's team. Perhaps even a robot invisible to the Head.
9. Meursault is a master of the staring contest.
10. In prison, Meursault learned to sleep 18 hours a day. He was bored.
11. Meursault is a good swimmer.
12. Meursault has no friends, but friends have Meursault. At the trial, all his acquaintances and friends stood up for him, but it didn't save the situation.
13. Meursault's friend Raymond was treated the same way as Meursault. Everyone considered him a pimp, which the prosecutor took advantage of and turned the evidence against the defendant. Raymond himself called himself a storekeeper. His actions in the middle of novel indirectly led to this whole tragic story.
14. Meursault wanted his execution to be spectacular.
15. Meursault enjoys admiring nature and the events unfolding around him.
16. According to Albert Camus's philosophy, life itself is absurd. Man has three escapes from absurdity: suicide, religion, and REBELLION! Wait for Meursault to rebel.

I will conclude my text with the final line of the novel: ""For the full fulfillment of my destiny, for me to feel less alone, I have only one wish: that on the day of my execution many spectators gather and that they greet me with cries of hatred.""

What's the best way to handle this?,"I’m not really sure what I’m looking for here - advice, perspective, or just to hear from people who’ve dealt with something similar. I want to vent somewhere and hear what others have to say about this situation.

My mom is 56. She’s been a difficult, pessimistic person for as long as I can remember, but over the past 2–3 years it feels like things got much worse.

She’s a housewife. My dad is working abroad and has always been away for months at a time. I've been living abroad for 7 years (studied and now working there) so she’s mostly alone. Over the years she’s gained a lot of weight, and as a result of that she now has knee problems which impair her movement sometimes. She struggles with stairs, getting out of bed, basic movement. Most days she stays in bed watching Netflix. She used to cook a lot, take care of the house and be active, but now she barely does. She mostly goes out just for coffee sometimes, and few short walks.

She constantly complains that she hates the city she lives in, that there’s nothing to do, that everyone is awful. I’ve suggested many times that she travel around the country, go abroad, or come visit me. She has the money, but she always finds excuses not to go and somehow always ends up blaming my dad for it.

Over the past few years I told her she should really see a doctor, because that she’s 56, not 80, and shouldn’t be struggling this much with basic things at this age. She flat out refuses. When I ask why, she said something that really hurt me: “You don’t need me anymore. I did my part. I don’t care anymore. I’m just waiting to die.”

She’s said similar things my whole life. That life has no point, that she’s just waiting for something to happen. Ever since I was a kid she kept venting to me with various problems (some serious some not), so I was always her emotional dump. It just messes me up having to her all these things from her, and her recent affirmations are straight up sad and disturbing to me.

I tried encouraging her to enjoy life now that I’m grown and doing okay. I suggested therapy, but she says it’s crap and doesn't need it. I suggested a personal trainer or mobility exercises, she says she’s too fat and doesn’t want to go to the gym. I suggested that we have a family meeting, agree on moving cities, or even change countries, so that she disconnects from the current situation and experiences something new, which might bring her joy and color to life again. She refuses doctors, refuses therapy, refuses any type of change.

My dad has tried talking to her too, but she shuts him down and blames him for literally everything, even things that have nothing to do with him (like random city problems while he’s working abroad). When I ask why she keeps blaming him, she says she has “reasons” and will tell me someday.

I feel stuck. She’s my mom, I love her, and it hurts hearing her talk like this. At the same time, it feels like no matter what I suggest, she just doesn’t want help or change. I don’t know where the line is between caring and destroying my own mental health trying to save someone who doesn’t want to be saved. I have my own problems and stress and it feels like these whole family thing is just making things worse. I am a very optimistic person and try to cheer people up even if I am down. She is exactly the opposite, saying she wants to die, that everyone is shit, that she wants to divorce my dad, etc.

Has anyone dealt with a parent like this?  
Part of me feels guilty but I am aware I am trying my best. At the end of the day, she is a fully grown adult and should be aware of everything I'm telling her.

We left yesterday morning to go to the sheriff's office, trying to figure out about that woman and the guy we saw last night. Chris wasn’t looking good; he kept grabbing at his side. I could tell the mark was bothering him. He looked pale and had a cold sweat on him. It took us twice as long to get to the station as it should have; he kept saying he was fine, but he was just putting on a front. We finally made it to the station and headed inside to be confronted by Sheriff Louis. He’s not the kind of guy you'd expect to be the head of law enforcement in town. Sure, he’s tall, but the guy is gaunt and almost sickly looking. He was standing near the entrance like he expected us to show up. Deputy Ross was in the back near the coffee machine. Guy was short and kind of round. To be honest, now that I’m thinking about it, they'd make a good sitcom duo. The station used to be a post office, but they ended up opening a new one and making this one the home base. Waste not want not and so forth. The place is really open; you can see most of it except for the back, where I assume they keep the files or whatever. “Hello Chris, you’re looking a little down today. Everything alright?” Sheriff Louis has this monotone voice that could put you to sleep.

 “I saw a woman… in the woods…” Chris was struggling to get the words out now.

 “Ok, what about your date in the woods?”

Chris looked like he was trying to concentrate with every brain cell he could muster.

“No…She was in the woods crying for help… When I approached the sound… she was like…fused into a tree? Her face was sticking out, and she was crying. Has anyone reported someone….missing?”

Sheriff Louis sighed really heavy after Chris finished. 

“Well, yeah, McNulty's wife went missing yesterday. We assumed she wandered off in the storm. But it sounds like you're the last person to see her alive. I don’t know about this tree business, but we're going to have to question you now. Rich, we’re going to take your friend Chris here to the back and get his story down. Also, as he admitted to being the last person to see her, it's crucial we hold onto him for a bit.”

“Can’t you see he's sick?” I blurted out. “He needs a doctor.”

“Yeah, he’ll get one. Doesn’t look like he's gonna keel over, so he’ll be alright.”

Deputy Ross escorted me outside. Chris had told me not to mention the guy last night or the mark. I wanted to only focus on the person missing and try to help her. So I kept quiet, and seeing as how I didn’t witness the woman going missing, I wasn’t any use to the sheriff. I wandered around downtown for the next couple of hours. I say downtown, but it’s just one road called Main Street. I stopped at the diner, I was off today, and the employee discount is too good to pass up. While sipping coffee and eating a slice of pie, I gazed out of the window and caught sight of someone in an alley between a couple of buildings across the street. I paid in cash and headed outside to check it out. In the alley was Harvey. Harvey was homeless; no one is too sure why he's homeless or what his story is. He doesn’t bother anyone and doesn’t beg. 

“Hey Harv, did you see anything weird last night? Like a guy with a freaky hat who sounded like a tree snapping in half when he moved?” Harvey was sitting on his blankets with his hood up, slumped against the wall. His face was away from me, so I got closer to make sure he was alright. 

“Harv, you good man?”

Harvey gasped like someone taking their first breath after almost drowning to death. He turned his face towards me. Half of it was a mess of what looked like roots woven into his skin. It went in and out of his flesh almost as if it were sewn; a root jutted from his eye socket, coming to a point like a horn from his face. His other eye rolled around wildly until finally focusing on me. 

He spoke with a voice that sounded like a room full of people speaking at once. All different pitches and tones. One of the most unnatural things I’ve ever heard. 

“The sins are eaten for the roots to stretch. Black night covers the heart, and no one runs!”

I fell backwards. He was trying to stand, contorting and making the same snapping sounds as the guy from last night. He kept saying the same thing over and over until it became a yell. “THE SINS THE SINS THE SINS THE SINS THESINSTHESINSTHESINS!”

My back was against the wall, and I could see now that Harvey was half abomination of tree and flesh tangled into each other in a way that shouldn’t be possible. As he got close, he collapsed. He didn’t say anything. The silence in the alley was deafening. I don’t know if he was breathing because I ran. I ran all the way back to the sheriff's station. I busted through the door, covered in sweat and breathing hard. 

“Rich, why are you busting through my door in a hurry like that?” Sheriff Louis was looking up at me from his glasses. 

“Never mind that, where's Chris? Are you all done talking to him?”

“Why, Rich, whatever do you mean? I haven’t seen Chris today. Ross, have you seen Chris today?”

“No, sir, can’t say I have.”

“That's bullshit, what are you talking about? You said he was going to give you a statement about the woman, where the fuck is he?”

The sheriff hit me so hard that I saw bright flashing lights all around me. Once my head cleared up and I looked up at him from the floor, he leaned down over me and talked quietly. 

“Chris Aint here, Rich. Chris went missing last night in the storm, didn’t he? Now drop it, you fucking weirdo, and get out of here. We’ll send out a search party like we always do.”

I was in shock. Where was Chris? Had they lost their minds? I just had to go tell Chris’s family what happened to him, and they'd be up here throwing a fit. There's no way they could get away with some shit like this. But as I scrambled to my feet and ran out the door, I got to thinking. All those search parties. All those families that mourned and accepted what happened. It's conditioned. We’re all conditioned not to ask questions or make a fuss. I could tell his family, and sure, maybe they’ll try and hold the sheriff accountable, but everyone in this town has a tendency to lie down and take it. Even if they did help me, there's no guarantee I’ll find out what happened to Chris. The only way to figure that out was to do it myself. No one in town has seen Chris since I dropped him off. Fuck it. Tonight I’m going to pay Sheriff Louis a visit and make him talk. ",3,1766607588.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

How do I set my Hario Skeletor (sp.) hand-cranked grinder to consistently produce the ideal grind-size for a Hario V60 pourover after I've adjusted it to grind for French press?

[This is my grinder. There are many like it,  but this one is mine.](https://preview.redd.it/0uuv0739v79g1.jpg?width=250&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cd1b63588f1d189c3b290efeeb4fbf93d4622da)

**Hypothesis:**

* Adjusting to burr to a known measurement will create the grind size needed for my chosen brewing method

[The \\""burr gap\\"" illustrated. Lack of image quality is your guarantee that this is not an image created by robots.](https://preview.redd.it/mhnlqapnx79g1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b279c8e2f70068952721be7e715570f3335e21e)

**Experiment**

1. Remove the crown nut, crank and lock washer from the grinder, twist the retaining nut that raises and lowers the rotating burr.
2. Measure and record the gap between the rotating and stationary burrs by placing the flat end of my metal ruler on the rim of the stationary burr then measure to the end of the rotating burr.
3. Reassemble the grinder.
4. Measure and add two grams of coffee beans (Sprouts Organic Sunrise Blend Medium Roast) to the grinder's hopper.
5. Grind the beans at about 2 secs per crank.
6. Pour out and label the resulting grinds in separate piles.

**Limitations**

* Adjustment ranged from 0mm and 8mm.
* The finest measurement I could reliably get was to the whole millimeter. 
* Additionally, the notched adjustment nut didn't allow finer adjustment. Once the desired height was dialed in, replacing the pronged retaining washer forced the grinder shaft to rotate slightly and had some impact on the final height.
* As better grinders adjust by microns — of which there are 1000 in an mm — I knew my results would be hugely approximate.

**Outcomes**

* A crude chart showing the grind size and consistency of burr adjustments ranging from 1mm - 8mm
* A preliminary method for burr adjustment, using the ruler to adjust then confirm burr height of 2mm (for pourover) to 5mm (for French press).

**Further inquiries**

How Can markings be added to the notched rataining nut or elsewhere to make adjustment possible without measurement? *My guess would be that counting threads above the retaining nut holds the answer.*",1,1766607509.0,pourover,0,1.0,False
