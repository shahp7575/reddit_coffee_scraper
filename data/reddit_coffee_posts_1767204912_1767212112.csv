1q0m9mn,https://i.redd.it/puq4t09bdlag1.jpeg,Teahaul,"Today, we visited a Dutch chain coffee and tea store in the city of Breda. Lovely people there. Simon Lévelt stores may not be the best or cheapest source of tea, it is worth a visit if you are in Holland. In my experience, when it comes to the more expensive teas, online you can find about the same quality for considerably less, but I like the storefront experience. The free savings program gets me 5% off the below prices.

I got:

1. Blackwood Orange Pekoe: A thick, organic honey black from Idalgashinna Estate in Sri Lanka. Sweet and full-bodied. A real classic, basic tea. Fair value, €90/kg

2. Benifuki black tea: This is my first Japanese black. It is awesome, sweet and with a hint of nuts. Strange tea grade, some particles are as small as BOP, other leaves are almost fully intact. This is a hybrid cultivar, I feel they got the best out of both. It reminds me of an oolong a little, but not overly. Expensive, but Japanese teas are. €240/kg

3. Taiwanese Baozhong: Another first, this is somewhere between a classic medium roasted ball rolled Taiwanese oolong and a slightly floral and citrussy green tea. Interesting, something I will need to taste more. But not a lot, expensive. €299/kg

  
4. Verveine: A classic I had never tasted pure. Now I wish I had sooner, I instantly recognise the lemony herbal taste from blends, but did not realise it actually has a decent body all by itself. This would be expensive, but the leaves are really wonderfully sorted and I'm great condition. Fair price, €140/kg

  
5. Langkloof Honey bush: Organic, from the Langkloof Honeybush company. Another first. Great stuff this. Very sweet. At first I thought I would not like it, because I could smell kurkuma. However, that flavor is only faintly there in the aftertaste. The predominant flavours are honey, cinnamon and clove. They could call this spice bush. Fair price, €66/kg

  
I can't really pick my favorite. What about you? Do you have experiences with any of these (types of) teas and tissues that can help me learn more about them?",1,1767211889.0,tea,1,1.0,False

​They were able to see family on my mom’s side for the first time, watched a light show, and we celebrated Christmas together. We also went to an immersive art exhibit, walked through a historical village, and made multiple trips to the playground. We did makeup, created art, finished some schoolwork for my oldest, played with Barbies, and played video games. We even made it out to a coffee shop. It was the best way to end the year, as strange as this year has been.

​I could tell my oldest was on the verge of being overtired when they started to get upset. They didn’t want to go back to their mom’s today because they aren't allowed to go outside there. They said their mom is afraid they will be kidnapped, which just broke me inside. I would truly love to have my children with me all the time. They are the anchor to my boat and the best part of my life.

​I love every minute I spend with them and cherish making these memories. I know they will get older and find friends, and our time together might become less frequent, but I will always have this 'museum of memories.' That is the greatest blessing in life.",3,1767211726.0,daddit,0,1.0,False

1q0m422,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1q0m422/my_job_is_to_eat_shrimp_or_what_i_thought_was/,"My Job is to Eat Shrimp, or What I Thought Was Shrimp","I’ve always been a creature of habit. Wake up at 5:30 AM, brew a pot of black coffee strong enough to strip paint, and head out to whatever dead-end job pays the bills. For the past six months, that job has been at Oceanic Delicacies, a sprawling warehouse on the outskirts of Port Haven, a foggy coastal town in Maine where the air always smells like salt and decay. The gig? Quality control tester for shrimp. Yeah, you heard that right. My job is to eat shrimp. Or at least, what I thought was shrimp.

It started innocently enough. I saw the ad on a job board online: “No experience necessary. Competitive pay. Must have a strong stomach and no seafood allergies.” I figured, why not? I’d been laid off from my last position at a cannery—something about automation replacing human hands—and my savings were dwindling faster than the tide recedes. The interview was a joke: a quick chat with a bored HR rep named Marlene, who handed me a form and a pen. “Sign here, and you’re in,” she said, her eyes glazed like she’d repeated the line a thousand times.

The warehouse was massive, a labyrinth of conveyor belts, humming freezers, and the constant clatter of machinery. My station was in a sterile white room at the back, isolated from the main floor. It was called the “Tasting Lab,” but it felt more like a clinical exam room—fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, a metal table with a stool, and a one-way mirror on the wall that I swore someone was always watching from behind. Every day, I’d clock in, don a hairnet and gloves, and wait for the samples.

The process was simple: A slot in the wall would open, and a tray would slide out with ten to fifteen shrimp, peeled and deveined, sometimes raw, sometimes cooked in various seasonings. I’d eat them one by one, noting texture, flavor, freshness on a digital tablet. Too salty? Mark it. Rubbery? Flag it. Off-putting aftertaste? Report it. Then, the tray would retract, and another would appear. Eight hours a day, five days a week. It was monotonous, but the pay was $25 an hour, plus benefits. In Port Haven, that was a king’s ransom.

At first, I loved it. Shrimp had always been a guilty pleasure—cocktail shrimp at parties, shrimp scampi on date nights back when I had those. The samples were premium: plump, juicy, with that briny snap you only get from fresh catch. I’d chew slowly, savoring the burst of ocean flavor, the subtle sweetness beneath the salt. My notes were glowing: “Excellent firmness,” “Perfect balance of umami,” “No fishy undertone.” I even started dreaming about shrimp—endless platters floating in a sea of cocktail sauce.

But around week three, things got… weird. It started with the textures. One batch felt off, like the meat was too fibrous, almost stringy, as if threads of something tougher were woven in. I noted it: “Slightly chewy, possible over-processing.” The next day, another tray came with shrimp that wriggled faintly when I picked them up. I blinked, thinking it was a trick of the light, but no—tiny spasms, like they weren’t quite dead. “Residual nerve activity?” I typed, my fingers hesitating. In the cannery days, I’d seen fish twitch post-mortem, but shrimp? They were supposed to be inert.

I mentioned it to Marlene during my weekly check-in. She laughed it off, her voice tinny over the intercom. “Oh, that’s just the new sourcing. We’re testing deep-sea varieties—fresher than fresh. Keeps the flavor locked in.” I nodded, but a seed of doubt planted itself. Deep-sea shrimp? I’d never heard of such a thing being commercially viable. Port Haven’s waters were shallow, battered by storms, not the abyssal depths.

As weeks turned to months, the anomalies piled up. Some shrimp had an iridescent sheen, like oil on water, shifting colors under the lights—blue to green to purple. Others tasted metallic, a coppery tang that lingered on my tongue for hours. I started getting headaches after shifts, pounding migraines that blurred my vision. At home, I’d collapse on my couch, staring at the ceiling, feeling like something was crawling under my skin.

One night, after a particularly odd batch—shrimp that popped like caviar when bitten, releasing a viscous fluid—I dreamed vividly. I was underwater, in a vast, dark ocean trench. Bioluminescent shapes darted around me, not fish, but elongated things with too many segments, glowing eyes clustered in rows. They pulsed with light, beckoning. I reached out, and one latched onto my hand, its mouthparts unfolding like petals. I woke up gasping, my palm itching where nothing was there.

The next shift, the trays came faster. No breaks between them. I’d barely finish logging one batch before another slid out. The shrimp were larger now, almost prawn-sized, with veins that pulsed faintly under the translucent flesh. I bit into one, and it squirted—warm, not cold like it should be. The flavor was richer, almost creamy, with an undercurrent of something earthy, like soil after rain mixed with blood.

I flagged it: “Unusual temperature—sample warm upon arrival. Flavor profile altered.” No response from the intercom. Usually, Marlene or someone would chime in with excuses. Silence.

My body had started to change. I noticed it in the mirror one morning: my skin looked paler, veins more prominent, especially around my neck and wrists. Blueish lines threading under the surface. I itched constantly, scratching until I bled. The headaches evolved into something worse—whispers, faint at first, like static in my ears. Words I couldn’t make out, bubbling up from somewhere deep.

At work, the one-way mirror seemed to fog sometimes, as if breath was on the other side. I’d catch glimpses of movement in the reflection, shadows shifting when I wasn’t looking directly. The shrimp—God, the shrimp—started looking different. Not just in texture or taste, but shape. Some had extra ridges along the tail, tiny protrusions like nascent limbs. Others had what looked like eyespots, dark dots that followed me as I lifted them to my mouth.

I tried to quit once. Went to Marlene’s office after a shift, my tablet clutched in shaking hands. “This isn’t right,” I said. “The samples… they’re not normal shrimp.” She smiled, that same glazed expression. “Nonsense. You’re our best tester. Top scores every week. Here’s a bonus.” She slid an envelope across the desk—$500 cash. I took it. Bills don’t pay themselves.

That night, the itching intensified. In the shower, I scratched my forearm raw, and something moved beneath the skin. A ripple, like a worm burrowing. I stared, water cascading over me, convinced it was hallucination. But no—it happened again. A small bulge traveling up my arm, then vanishing.

The dreams grew more frequent. Always the trench, the glowing creatures. But now, they spoke. Not with voices, but impressions—hunger, ancient patience, a promise of belonging. I’d wake with salt crust on my lips, even though I lived miles from the shore.

The trays never stopped. I’d eat hundreds a day, my stomach distending painfully, but I never felt full. The shrimp were alive now, unmistakably. They’d curl when touched, antennae—actual antennae—twitching. Some tried to escape the tray, scuttling toward the edge. I’d pin them with a fork, force them down. The taste was exquisite agony: sweet decay, electric vitality surging through me.

My notes became erratic: “Sample exhibits motility. Recommend halt.” “Flavor induces euphoria—potential contaminant.” “Eyes present. Multiple.” Still, silence from the intercom.

I started sneaking samples home. Wrapped in napkins, hidden in my lunch bag. Under my kitchen light, magnified with a cheap loupe I’d bought online, the truth stared back. They weren’t shrimp. Segmented bodies, jointed legs folded tight, mandibles tucked beneath. Larval forms, perhaps, of something much larger. Deep-sea horrors, harvested from trenches no sub should reach.

I searched online late at night, forums about cryptic marine life, leaked documents from oceanographic expeditions. Whispers of “benthic anomalies” caught in trawls off the continental shelf, things that mimicked commercial species to infiltrate supply chains. Parasites that rewrote hosts from within.

The itching spread everywhere. My back, my scalp, between my toes. In the mirror, my eyes had changed—pupils slightly elongated, irises flecked with that same iridescence.

One shift, the slot opened, but no tray came. Instead, a voice—finally—from the intercom. Not Marlene’s. Deeper, resonant, like pressure waves in water. “You’ve adapted well. Integration phase complete.”

The lights dimmed. The one-way mirror cleared, revealing not a observation room, but darkness. An abyss, lit by faint bioluminescence. Shapes moved beyond—massive, segmented, familiar.

I looked down at my hands. The skin split painlessly, peeling back like a shell. Beneath, something pale and jointed flexed. Legs? Feelers?

The tray arrived then, empty. An invitation.

I understood. My job wasn’t to test shrimp. It was to become the vessel. To carry them inland, spread the brood.

The whispers clarified: We are the tide that returns. You are the bridge.

I stepped toward the slot. It widened, accommodating. The air grew cold, briny.

As I crossed the threshold, into the wet dark beyond the wall, I felt the last of the old me slough away. Hunger remained—the eternal, patient hunger.

Back in the lab, a new stool waited. A new tablet. Soon, another applicant would sign the form.

I’m laying on this plate waiting for them. ",2,1767211474.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1q0m3c1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1q0m3c1/hell_spend_money_on_me_just_not_when_im_the_one/,"He'll spend money on me, just not when I'm the one who chooses the plan. When we were younger, he wasn't like this - now that we're dating, I am starting to despise him because I'm afraid to assert what I want.","I'm 30 and dating someone (on and off for 3 years) who confuses me a lot. On paper, he can be generous. For example, for Christmas he gave me about $80 worth of gifts, but they're not stuff I asked for (some items are OK, like tea/coffee). But in day to day dating, his behavior feels passive aggressive and transactional in a way that’s starting to really bother me.

Most of our hangouts are initiated by him. If he asks to meet and I say I’d like to go to Starbucks, he won't say ""sure"" and then keep asking where we’re meeting multiple times. I get the strong sense he’s hoping I’ll eventually suggest somewhere else. If I stick to Starbucks, he’ll show his displeasure by already having ordered his drink by the time I arrive, even when I’m not late, and then I go up and order my drink alone while he's sitting, which makes me feel awkward and like I’m being punished for my choice.

For Christmas, he gave me a bunch of ground coffee - which is probably to tell me to start drinking coffee at home (WHICH I DO, I only go to Starbucks 2-3 times a month!).

The same pattern shows up with restaurants. He hates anywhere that isn’t all you can eat, something I later learned is a big family preference. I hate AYCE places because I don't have a big appetite and prefer quality over quantity. If I want to go to a specific restaurant, he’ll still come, but suddenly he can’t drive, even if he initially offered. That day it’s always that his parents or siblings “have the cars.” It feels like quiet retaliation rather than an honest conversation.

Money-wise, it’s also uncomfortable. He’ll let the bill sit on the table untouched for a long time until I finally just pay for both of us to break the tension. He doesn’t say anything, just waits. With movies, I noticed a similar thing. Every movie we’ve seen has been one he suggested. He’s never asked what I want to see. This past summer, he asked me to see a movie and suggested a kids movie (Elio?). I countered with the F1 movie, which I really wanted to see. He refused. If it’s a movie he wants to see, he’ll buy my ticket. If it’s not, he’ll either buy only his own or just let me pay.

What messes with my head is that he isn’t consistently cheap or ungenerous. He just seems generous when it aligns with what he already wants. When it doesn’t, he becomes passive aggressive instead of communicating directly. I’m starting to feel like my preferences are an inconvenience and that I’m being subtly trained to default to what he wants (so now, I don't even initiate dates with him).

I now feel uncomfortable by this pattern, even though he does show generosity in other ways. I've known this guy since we were teenagers (childhood neighbors) and he used to actually do what I want. Is this now a real red flag about control, resentment, or incompatibility that I shouldn’t ignore?",1,1767211418.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1q0m30g,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0m30g,Four Seasons Cabo San Lucas - for Families review,"**Overall Impression**

Initially I wasn’t going to review FS Cabo because others have done it admirably and recently. However, my family sits down on NYE and gives our top 5 moments of the year, and resoundingly this hotel was among the top 5 for each of my 3 kids. A consensus like that is rare. So while many reviews have been written from the perspective of couples and villa stayers, I thought I’d share my thoughts as a mom who travels frequently solo with her kids (their school has breaks roughly every seven weeks, plus a lot of long weekends. We live in the PNW so finding sun is a never-ending goal).

This Four Seasons delivers the polish you expect from the brand while incorporating authentic Mexican design elements that actually feel rooted in place. The architecture (white buildings with beautiful archways, cobblestone courtyards, and vibrant blue and green tiles) does a really good job of delivering a (manicured) sense of place, which is not always the case with this brand. Overall for families 10/10. 

**About Me**

I’m an advisor on u/sarahwlee’s team and have 3 kids who travel with me frequently. I evaluate properties through the dual lens of what works for families and as a luxury hotel specialist. This review specifically addresses how this resort functions for families with children under 13. 

**Accommodations**

The property has 96 guest rooms and suites plus 61 villas and residences designed by Meyer Davis (Rosewood Little Dix, Etereo, Mauna Lani, FS Papagayo etc). Entry-level La Casona rooms start at 850 square feet (spacious - we stayed in a 2Q ocean view and were very comfortable - the patio was giant and I enjoyed sitting there in the early morning drinking my coffee with the door shut to block out the sounds of the Bluey theme song. Rooms do well blocking out noise) with ocean or garden views. Casitas scattered throughout the property range from 1,765-1,959 square feet with options for plunge pools, outdoor showers, and connecting configurations for families. Multi-bedroom villas (2-5 bedrooms) are part of the Private Retreats collection with full kitchens, private pools, and villa host service.

Important note: The landscaping is still maturing. Ground-floor plunge pools currently have sight lines to neighboring units and walkways. A neighbor definitely saw my son’s butt probably more than they wanted to. C’est la vie. This should improve as the bougainvillea fills in. The outdoor showers, however, are genuinely private and beautifully designed. My kids loved the welcome amenity of plush whales (and the resort helpfully left binoculars for us to view real ones off our deck), as well as the kids toiletry sets, robes and kid sized slippers. 

All rooms have Nespresso machines with Mexican coffee pods, as well as excellent electronic blackout drapes, lots of outlets and because the resort is brand new, everything is in pretty pristine condition.

**Pool**

Two distinct pool experiences. The family pool sits slightly back from the beach bluff with multiple depths, platforms, and shallow play areas integrated along the edges where parents lounge. It’s heated and saltwater. There’s a small splash fountain area toward the back. Throughout the day, staff circulate with complimentary smoothie shots, popsicles, and light bites like street corn, ceviche, or taquitos. Every umbrella has an ice bucket stocked with canned water. Both pools have lawn games (cornhole, giant chess) and share the Coraluz menu.

The adult pool sits on the bluff edge above the beach with more energy. While we were there incentive groups were gathering here during our visit. Bar Brisal anchors the space.

The beach stretches wide with plenty of chairs and umbrellas. The sand has some shells and rocks but nothing too rough underfoot. The water itself is quite rocky and is not a beach for casual swimming or playing in the shallows - the waves can be quite rough. The coastline view is stunning with dramatic rocks and impressive waves, but swimming is only for strong, experienced swimmers.

**Spa/Gym**

Well-equipped fitness center with a main gym plus outdoor workout section (designed by celebrity trainer Harley Pasternak). Separate studio with spin bikes and group class equipment.

The spa pool (Tierra Mar Spa) is relatively small but nicely designed as an infinity edge. Views face toward the back of the property, mostly trees with glimpses of ocean beyond.

**Dining**

Service across all restaurants was exceptional with attentive servers and excellent tables.

Sora (rooftop): Fun, energetic vibe with lots of bright hot pinks, yellows, and oranges with firepits. See attached pic - my kids were enthralled. 

Palmerio (Mediterranean): The space feels like a European garden terrace. For dinner we had various appetizers, salads, pasta, and fish, everything well-executed with French and Italian Riviera influences. Breakfast has a substantial buffet, but I preferred the a la carte menu with excellent Mexican breakfast options.

Coraluz (Baja-inspired Mexican): Completely open-air by the family pool. Seating ranges from swinging chairs (somehow they politely allowed my kids to play on these all through dinner) and couches in the shade to tables at the sand’s edge. Strong Mexican menu.

Cayao (Japanese fusion by Richard Sandoval): Didn’t eat here with my kids, but it’s the tasting menu restaurant blending Peruvian and Japanese flavors. 

**Experiences/Activities**

My kids felt very welcomed here - and more importantly as a parent, I felt that staff took special care to notice me along with my kids - from the popsicles they were welcomed to the hotel with and sequestered in a nice seating area so I could focus on check in, to the fortune they were given by a sweet staff member who personally invited them to the kids club, to staff proactively noticing and providing things to distract my kids when I had to pay a bill or when my 4 year old son got restless at breakfast, I appreciated feeling well taken care of as a mom traveling solo. 

The absolute highlight: Papalote Kids For All Seasons. Although we stayed at a few hotels in Cabo this year, this was top 2 for kids clubs overall, my kids did not want to leave. Like all Kids For All Seasons programs, it’s complimentary with drop-off whenever it works for your schedule. Modern, organic design with light wood play structures, plenty of toys, good natural light. Security is taken seriously with locked entry. Outdoor play area with sand section and shade covering.

The average stay at any given hotel in Cabo is 3-4 nights, and weekends are of course the busiest part of the week. Every Friday evening, FS hosts an event called “La Plaza Mágica” with mariachi music, local art displays at El Taller Art Studio, and tequila tastings at El Mercado, open to guests and locals alike. It’s a very fun event and unique for the area. 

**Final Takeaways**

Four Seasons Cabo San Lucas at Cabo Del Sol is a sophisticated family-friendly resort with exceptional kids programming, strong service, and genuine Mexican design character in a central location. The Kids Club alone justifies this property for families. The beach isn’t swimmable, which matters for setting expectations, but for families who prioritize resort amenities, dining variety, and programming over water activities, this delivers. The location puts you 15 minutes from downtown Cabo San Lucas and 25 minutes from San José del Cabo.

**Who This Resort Is For**

∙	Families with children of all ages who value exceptional kids programming and complimentary drop-off childcare

∙	Luxury travelers wanting authentic Mexican sense of place with modern, up to date (usb outlets, electronic blinds, excellent air conditioning, Dyson hairdryers etc - all is brand new) hacienda design

∙	Groups needing both lively gathering spaces and venues for different preferences

∙	Travelers prioritizing resort experience and dining variety over beach activities

∙	Multi-generational travel where adults want sophisticated spaces and children need genuine entertainment

∙	Anyone wanting Golden Corridor accessibility close to Cabo San Lucas and San José del Cabo

**Who This Resort Is Not For**

	∙	Beach swimmers and water sports enthusiasts. The rocky water and rough surf make this a “look at the ocean” beach, not a “get in the ocean” beach

∙	Travelers seeking isolated, quiet luxury; this property has energy, especially around the adult pool and Friday night programming

∙	Couples wanting exclusively adult spaces—families are integrated throughout most of the resort

∙	Budget-conscious luxury travelers",3,1767211397.0,FATTravel,1,1.0,False

1q0lzws,https://i.redd.it/mpzqwup5ilag1.jpeg,The Problem is THEM!!,"I came here to rant a little because I am SO FED UP with all last mile delivery from pretty much everyone now being sent through USPS. I live in a rural area where my mailbox is in a large bank of small slots at the intersection of my dirt road and the local highway.  It is about a half mile from my house. There are about 6 small package lockers in the bank, which fit moderately sized items which you can retrieve with a key left in your mail slot. Just this week I was given the key to a parcel locker which contained someone else’s coffee order (smelled good!) I brought it to the post office and left my phone number. My husband and I were expecting a Christmas gift for a friend and a phone power bank, which show delivered but we did not get. I can only assume the delivery person swapped the keys by accident, but now how do we get our items?? Today, I got this notice for some wood canvases I had ordered from Amazon which would definitely not fit in the locker, but usually Amazon had come in the past through either UPS or Fed Ex, who deliver right to my porch. Now, since it’s Dec 31 and the USPS delivery person won’t be back before the local PO closes at 4:30, and they will be closed Jan1, I won’t get my package until Jan 2 if at all. Additionally, in the last year multiple times our local USPS has returned items to sellers without even trying to deliver them to us. I confronted them about it once and they blamed the UPS sticker label covering the shipping label or something. 

Is anyone else having these issues??? Is it just rural deliveries that are being handed off? Also, what do I do about the items that were mistakenly given to someone in the neighborhood via the key swap?",1,1767211182.0,usps_complaints,0,1.0,False

I have a 15m2 waiting area for my takeaway coffee shop. 3 sides closed and one large 5 meter side is open to the street. 

Setup is;
Wiim mini - smsl su1 dac - adam t10s sub with 80hz hpf to edifier r2850db. I have a -12db 20hz equaliser on, to not move furniture with high vibration. Volume is around 70-75db. Music is the main theme but people still can talk with eachother. 

Playing on spotify with around 1000 songs from various genres. Placed some acoustic pads as good as i can so its an average room with average setup and the result seems good enough to make people feel there is an extraordinary sound at the place. (For general coffee and desert buyers)

Its a high volume cafe and there is mostly a queue, means people waiting for around 5-10 minutes.

As I see it, these are my options:

* quick and dirty: plane and sand away the damaged areas, re-stain and present it as ""distressed""
* remove and replace the lids and try to match the stain
* replace the top and bottom, sand the box down and retain everything the same shade.

1q0lrw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1q0lrw7/planet_hollywood_adult_costa_mujeras/,Planet Hollywood Adult Costa Mujeras,"My daughter and I do an annual Dec trip somewhere south. This years trip was to Planet Hollywood Adult selection. Thought I’d share some of the pros/cons. 

Pros: 
- The hotel was beautiful, the grounds were perfect and well maintained. Lots of natural beauty, palm trees, floral bushes, flowers, well manicured lawns. 

- Lazy River was a nice lay out, fun, the grotto bar was cool. (On the family side)

- The room (Jr suite Star 11510) was quite large, had nice views, including the ocean. The balcony was large. Liked how the bath was split up, so was usable when someone was showering/using the toilet. 2 sink set ups with large well lit mirrors on opposite sides- again great for 2 people to get ready at the same time. 

- Beach was beautifully kept. White sand, gentle slope into ocean. Waves were fun to play in. 

- Staff was all super friendly, tried to be helpful. 

- drinks were good, food at most of the a la carte restaurants was average to good for AI. We especially enjoyed Brazza and the Italian. 

- the gelato cart. Loved it. The tangerine gelato was phenomenal. 

CONS

- if you are expecting a traditional adults only- think again. There are only 2 adult restaurants. The rest have kids, including the buffet and the star breakfast a la carte. There were kids often on the adult side, and a few times in the adult pool. We never saw anyone ask them to leave. Any of the hotel activities you want to partake in include children (flo rider, lazy River, star pool, star restaurants, night bars, beach, excursions, race car, arcade, even the night dance area). 

- The lack of lounge chairs for people at all the pools. The adult section there were 74 pool loungers, for all the adult section guests, 6 buildings I think). I have never seen so few loungers at an AI before. Most if not all were gone by 8am. Then staff were on you to see if you wanted to buy a cabana, or bed or pod which there were more of them I’ve ever seen at an AI also. 

- Star level extras were pretty shabby- other then being in building 11. The butlers could really do very little for anyone. At other resorts we’ve been to they’ve at least reserved pool chairs. Here they say they aren’t allowed. We never got turndown service. It took 3 days to get the bottle of wine. The fruit basket was some pears, a few apples and some mushy plums. The star breakfast place was the opposite end of the family side, was a small buffet that was constantly empty of items (we only ever saw empty containers of bacon, pineapple and a few other popular. People asked numerous times, and were just given shrugs). There was a star bar in the main lobby but the lines were quite long, and again not adults only. 

- Adults only lobby & bar. On the day we arrived it wasn’t staffed so we had to go through the family side check in. We were never shown it, and were only told it was the adults only check in area. On our last day, we were being picked up there and finally went. Wish we had known about it earlier!! Nice bar area, great fruit selection and deserts plus some nice finger foods. Nice seating area. Was more of an adults only lounge area. We didn’t even know it was there until check out. 

- No heated pools or hot tubs. Found this very unusual. Again most adults only we’ve been to have at least 1 heated pool. Sometimes it’s for the “club/star/premier” whatever guests, which is why we usually book the “club” rooms. 

- balconies, and which are quite large and ours had really nice views, we’re not relaxing or nice to sit on in the evening or early morning. There was constant mechanical noise from the large roof top ACs of the 2 restaurants in the adults only area. Constant. 24/7. It couldn’t be heard when the patio doors were closed, thankfully. But also made enjoying a quite coffee, reading and watching the sunrise/set hard to do.    The balconies were also quite large and only had a small table and 2 chairs. They could add a hammock or day lounger on them to make them more useable/appealing. 

- Buffet was a nightmare. Usually only max of 2 hostesses so the line ups were sooooooooo long at almost anytime of day. Each group would have to check in, then the hostess would seat them. When 20-50 groups are waiting this takes a lot of time for only 2 people to get to everyone.   The food was mediocre and often Luke warm to cool. Very few stations for hot meal prep were staffed- so the line ups again were super long for those. Very small area, which they tried to maximize with food counters, but made the space very smal for walking or getting around. Very little fruit. Pineapple always under stocked, would remain empty for long periods of time. Many of the popular foods would not be restocked quickly. We only saw bacon twice the entire time we were there, most of the time it was just an empty container. Pretty much the exact same food every single day. 

- Lack of staff was glaring. When we mentioned how few staff there were a few times, the staff members would say please tell them. We need more. As previously stated 2 hostesses for the entire buffet, resulted in long lines. Adult only check in closed when we arrived due to lack of staff. Bars with line ups everywhere with only 2 or 3 bartenders working a bar that would hold 5-6 bar tenders. Lines in all the a la cartes and very slow service- not because the staff that was there was lazy- it was because they were so understaffed. We heard staff often getting yelled at for the line ups, the slow service, simple requests being ignored or forgotten (like replacing items in mini fridge. We asked on day 2 for more coffee pods. We asked everyday until the day we left and never got any), why their rooms were not made up by 4pm when they had requested through the butler to have it done at 9am.   It was super obvious how way way understaffed they were. Felt terrible for the staff, as they were all very nice, and trying very hard. 


Overall for the price and the adults only side- we would not recommend or return.  The lack of staff, the lounge chair issue, the line ups for everything, and the food were big enough issues to stop us from returning.  For adults only- it really wasn’t and isn’t worth going for the adults only or star class anything.

So without further ado, let's begin.

**Part 1: Trauma and Repression**

[Coffee Motif](https://preview.redd.it/ahh5pc1q3lag1.jpg?width=1067&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=434ea8e1fe568aa74d208e20943c8184fabf6c6d)

Now the first thing I want to focus on is arguably one of the most important things to discuss when it comes to Denji's character, and that is of course how he deals with his trauma born from his rough upbringing. Unlike other shonen protagonists who state their problems more outright, Denji fascinates me as he deals with his trauma in a more subtle manner, where he would say one thing then completely express the opposite, which he probably developed as a coping mechanism just to survive. He's a little bit of a liar too himself just like Reze in a sense. But speaking of Reze, a thing that comes to mind concerning Denji's trauma is how it seems to bleed into his daily life.

Like remember just directly after the Reze Arc, where he thinks Reze bailed on him and he mentions how heartbroken he is, what does he do in the very next panel? he represses. He pretends everything is alright just so he can enjoy himself spending time with Makima. Like to him his solution is just putting his memories of missing Reze in the dark corners of his mind, no emotional resolution, no conclusive reflection, just pure repression to continue living his daily life. He did the same thing when Aki died, when Power died, and yes he did the same thing when his dad died, hence symbolized with him still remaining as a traumatized kid in the dreamscape which he never really resolved by the end of Part 1.

**Part 2: Reflection and Lingering Curses**

[Similar Coffee Motif](https://preview.redd.it/bg9x8b7k5lag1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f9e9d0de7a2db88504304ec7cfeaaa92ee4a5a8)

So now even with all the flaws in Part 2, from the abrupt character deaths, unresolved narrative threads and meandering plot development, to me they are still done on purpose as they are telling of the important changes in Denji's character that are essential to not only himself but also to the potential direction of the series. Like even with him trying to move foward with his life with him finally going to school, taking care of Nayuta, and etc. his repressed issues are later on revealed to us to still being a lingering curse that ironically resurfaces when he's drowning in his sorrows in the lake. From the thought of Aki, Nayuta, Power, and Reze leaving him, matters that seems to be things he's forgotten about just like what we assume is the case with Fujimoto but imo that couldn't be farther from the truth. And I say that because of one thing, Asa.

Now regardless of how you feel about Asa's relationship with Denji being platonic or romantic (I'm with the former) it's undeniable that she has become an important person in his life as she also serves as a mirror to who he is. Meaning Asa also has her own set of traumas she deals with it because of her own rough upbringing but what differentiates her from Denji is how she looks inward into herself and fully acknowledges them in her life. Something Denji needs to learn for himself. Now based on the past couple of chapters this finally seems to be case as when they were both in the dreamscape with Asa meeting kid Denji, he then finally appears as his actual age for the first time in the dreamscape. Visually representing how he's finally willing to heal from his trauma and how he's finally willing to deal with his problems head on.

Like with Yoru's defeat being imminent and with the world returning to some semblance of normal (hopefully lol). What could come afterwards in a Part 3 may become a continuation of this character arc for Denji, where he further deals with his problems in the form of following through with the things that have now currently become mere echoes in the manga. From his promise to find the Blood Devil, his grief from Nayuta and Aki's death, his unresolved feelings with Reze, and etc. things that have been long obscured in the series just like their faces in his memories, maybe now he can finally be clear in his decisions of making them concrete and tangible.

Fujimoto said Reze remains a lingering curse to Denji right? well like his trauma, all curses have to be lifted at some point, yes.",10,1767210553.0,RezeCult,5,1.0,False

It was really cold today so I had to get dressed to get coffee. So I put on my initial clothing choices and then took pictures of myself (still don’t have a full mirror yet) and just…hated it. And I had a good day yesterday, so I know I don’t \*always\* hate it.

So I changed boots, beanies, jackets, and just every combination looked SO MID, or straight up bad, and I also couldn’t tell what combination looked better.

At this point I was just frustrated and upset and went out anyway in an outfit I didn’t like because I didn’t have the energy to change AGAIN and expend so much more time trying to put together a good outfit.

Now I’m actually jealous of the people at the coffee shop who look so good - in equally simple outfits but they \*work.\* The way that the cut of their jeans hits their boots and then the jacket and the beanie all fit together looks so good and cool, and I’m like “why can’t I do that.”

Anyways sorry for the rant. I know you can’t know for sure, but does this sound like the LD key isn‘t working for me OR that I’m not using it correctly (like that I shouldn’t take pictures or something or I’m not being intuitive enough)? Edit: Or that I just don't own the clothes that can make me feel how I want to feel??

1q0lq5k,https://v.redd.it/yhq9scpvflag1,"I've perfected my flow, at least I think I have","9 cup Bialetti, beans were roasted 12/10 (Dec 10), 100% Arabica, Colombian Med/Dark roast. We bought it at a Farmers Market in Pensacola when we were down there this past weekend, roasted at Iron City Coffee in Birmingham, AL. 

I start with hot water (not boiling), med/low heat on my smallest/simmer burner (gas stove), then turn down to lowest setting when coffee starts coming out. 

Taste 10/10, very caramel and chocolate notes, which I love this time of year. I think I'm going to order some more beans from this company! I always get whole beans and grind at home, idk what brand my grinder is, but it's a big bur type electric grinder and I use the finest setting. It's just what works for me! 

I do want to get a smaller cup moka pot so I can see if it changes the taste of the coffee. I have a theory that the larger cup mokas can keep the coffee on the heat just a tad too long. I can't use pure dark roasts in my moka, no matter how I brew it, the cup always taste too bitter. Plus, on days like today when my husband isn't home to get his cup, I only need a 1-3 cup, bc I do not drink a whole 9 cup pot of coffee. 

I have a lighter roast from this same company we picked up at the farmers market, it was roasted on Christmas Eve, can't wait to try it! 

Also, I know I need to clean my stove, I don't wanna hear it. I've been out of town and my 20yr old was here fending for himself, and he's always forgetting to clean under the stove grate. ",6,1767210455.0,mokapot,7,0.88,False

Last Pick: **Jaylen Brown 3+ Three Pointers❌(4-POTD LOSING STREAK)-1U**

Today's Pick: **Pacers ML**

**$DKNG**: **+160**

Wager Amount: 1U to WIN 1.6U

League: Orlando Magic vs Indiana Pacers (2:00PM CST)

**Recap**: Brown took 3 three pointer attempts in the 1st quarter, missed the first two and made the last one and that was it!! No more 3-point attempt after the 1st quarter. Kind of a bad beat, but not really. Because we needed 3 three point made and he only took 3 shots beyond the arc. He didn't even come close to hitting the output on his last matchup or even scoring 25 points. Looks like he's settled being tied wit the C's legend.

**Matchup:** On a drought if you don't kno and can't help it but to go on a self fade again (hopefully I don't run this up to 16 straight POTD L's like last time). So today I'm rolling wit the Pacers. Magic should win, they have more wins on the road than the Pacers win in the an entire season. Although Pacers do have 5 of their 6 wins at home, they should still lose regardless if they are at home. Pacers are one the worst teams in the league, I think they are actually. Take the Magic on the road. -192 price is not a bad price.

**The Play & Prediction :** 1U on Pacers ML. No predictions today

1q0lorf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1q0lorf/im_pregnant_and_have_completely_fucked_my_life_up/,I’m pregnant and have completely fucked my life up F18,"Before I start I’m gonna say please don’t judge me. I know I fucked up and my life is a mess and I am very aware of that. I don’t even know if this is the right sub so please remove my post if it isn’t

I F18 had a few weeks in October where I just lost the plot. I was meeting up with random older guys from Tinder for sex who were quite rough and I still have the bruises but I enjoyed it at the time and I was masturbating constantly even when it hurt and drinking every day and taking all sorts of drugs. I hardly slept too for that full time which I think just made things even worse. Like I’m not even joking I think I slept like 8 hours for the full 2 and a bit weeks or however long it was but I wasn’t even tired. Last time I felt like this I spent all my money trying to start this stupid beauty business even though everyone told me it was a dumb idea and I ended up making precisely $0. I’m still paying off my credit cards for that.

At the start of November I started feeling like shit and I’ve been so depressed and suicidal. Ive not been going to college and have fell behind on all my work and have just been sleeping all day and barely eating. My job at a coffee shop fired me a few weeks ago and I don’t even care because I didn’t have the energy to go. I told my manager I was feeling depressed but she said that it wasn’t good enough and I do understand we are busy at this time of year. But I really am depressed. I actually can’t remember the last time I actually ate something and I’m definitely dehydrated af. Like my pee is dark orange but I don’t have the energy to get a bottle of water. My flatmate has brought me sandwiches and water but she’s with her parents now until college starts again in a few weeks

Now I just found out I’m pregnant and I don’t even know who the father is. I fucking hate myself. I ordered some tests online and they are all positive except 1 but I don’t think I peed on it properly. I think my period was last in October at the start but I can’t remember for sure. I can’t believe I’ve let this happen and I hate myself. I am disgusting. Have all the drugs and alcohol hurt the baby? I’m such a mess and have no idea what to do. My parents are going to kill me and I’m probably gonna get kicked out of college because I haven’t turned in my assignments. I feel really bad if I’ve fucked the baby up with all the drinking and I also smoked weed and did cocaine and speed and other stuff I can’t even remember. Is there any way to check? Should I go to the doctor? What if the baby is deformed because of what I did? I’m on my parents health insurance plan so they’ll probably find out.  I have fucked up bad and my parents will probably disown me. I just feel like I’m stuck and can’t get out. I don’t know why I keep making these stupid choices which I hate myself for after. Now I feel like I’m being watched but I don’t even know who by. Even when I’m in bed with the covers over my head I feel like people can see me. I have these horrible blisters on my hips and elbows which are just getting worse. Getting out of bed is the hardest thing ever and The urge to just end it all is real. I don’t know why I’m like this. I just want to be normal like my friends.",1,1767210350.0,offmychest,2,0.67,False
1q0lm3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1q0lm3o/aio_family_took_the_tough_part_of_tough_love_a/,"AIO Family took the ""tough"" part of tough love a little too seriously this Christmas","There are probably 20 pages of back story for all of this to make sense, so I will do my best to explain the situation by including only necessary details. If something is missing or not making sense, let me know!

This year, I (34F) went home to my parents in my hometown, and my brother (31M) and his wife (35F) flew in a few days after me. I am at a low point in my life: I was laid off almost two years ago, and have spent this time working on a tech startup. My parents do not approve of this at all, as they are older, foreign and risk-averse. This is my first time doing something that I am truly passionate about and that they don't approve of. But, I am in my mid-thirties, and my life and career have not gone as I would have liked by obeying and following their advice. I am now coming to realize that lot of my choices are altered or contorted to please them. Frankly, this method has not been working, and I've put in a tremendous amount of inner work to do something that is true to me, even if it means disappointing them. 

It's relevant to the story that I am also in a bad relationship (toxic, abusive, and at times a little scary, although I am not in physical danger). I live with my partner (41M), and have been seeking ways to leave safely, which has been difficult, primarily because startup life doesn't pay well. With that being said, I am happily pivoting to something more stable so that I can get back on my feet, but getting hired hasn't happened as quickly as I'd like. I am looking for different ways to do this, including finding any job whatsoever so I have enough saved up to leave, debating crashing on a friend's couch (those who know the situation have offered, but I'd rather get a job and not be indebted to people).

  
All in all, not a proud phase of life, but I am staying diligent and have confidence and trust that daily effort will be rewarded, eventually, one way or another. 

  
My parents are extremely upset about the general state of my life, and decided to have a sit down talk that got explosive pretty quickly. They ripped into me about how stupid I am for the relationship choices I make (not completely wrong, but getting yelled at for being abused is an odd feeling). My dad especially refuses to listen or understand when I tried to describe just how abusive and controlling my current partner is, blaming me for not leaving. For example, I have tried to leave in the past, but my partner will stand in front of the doorway, or the car, so that I can't. I was trying to explain this to my dad; he would interrupt me before I could get a word out, until I finally described the situation in an agitated tone, and his response was, ""You're hallucinating threats where there are none. Why wouldn't someone let you leave?""  

  
The entire conversation went like that, and I was so flustered. I am already struggling to keep it together, and have been for a long time, so I don't have the patience or emotional capacity to let their comments roll off of me like I usually do. 

Another family dynamic is my brother's relationship with my mom. He was the golden boy and I was the black sheep growing up, although we were both straight A students that stayed out of trouble for the most part. We do have very different personalities. He is straight-edged and nondescript: went to college for engineering undergrad, worked in consulting for a few years before getting an MBA, and then went back into consulting, but at a better firm. I earned the same engineering degree in undergrad, but was more interested in the actual building/engineering aspect, and have pursued that in my career. I'm also more creative/free-spiritied (and at times more chaotic) than my brother. Growing up, he was my mom's favorite, which I didn't really notice as a child. It was extended family that would step in and fight for me when my mom would be abusive towards me, and who gently explained the dynamic to me when I was a little older. 

My brother has always treated me like a low-life; we are not close, we don't talk much, and whenever we are together, such as for Christmas, he'll avoid me or roll his eyes whenever I say something. In general, throughout my life, if I spoke or made any noise, it was totally ignored. I grew up as if I didn't exist. My key motivation for doing well in school was to leave and get as far away from my family as possible. My brother's attitude towards me hurts, because he's the only other person who knows the things my mom would do to me. And instead of having an inkling of sympathy, he treats me like I deserved it.

  
So, this holiday break, after the big argument with my parents, my brother asked me to walk with him when he was gonna take his dog out. I knew this was to have a conversation, something he has literally never done before with me. He started off with some generic advice, which, although irrelevant to my situation, was very sweet, and very atypical of the way he usually treats me. Which is fine; family is here for the emotional support, not necessarily for actionable advice, if they're not in your industry. Thought that counts. I let him talk for a good while, but eventually started responding, especially when he was wrong about certain stuff, and the conversation unraveled to a yelling match, with him being insanely condescending (""Shut up and listen to someone who knows better than you!"", wagging his finger in my face, literally close to my eyes and refusing to stop that when I asked him to). I started to walk away and he yelled, ""Don't you ever dare come to me or my wife or my \[future\] kids for help because I will NEVER help you, EVER!"" And I thought, we don't have a relationship. We don't even talk. I have never considered him someone I could even call for a five minute conversation in a time of need, let alone for financial help. In what scenario did he presume what he said would ever be a threat for me? Furthermore, he got into $200k+ of debt for an MBA that led him to a job he hates so he can pay off his loans. He's not making more than he would be if he had stayed in his original consulting job and never gone to business school. He's pretty far off from being in a position to help anyone. So like, why does he think he knows things? His life kinda sucks. 

  
The comment about how he'll never help me hurt, because when I finished undergrad and got my first job, I offered to help him with his student loans. I never actually did. My mom found out about it and laughed it off. She told me to save my money for myself and that she and my dad would take care of my little brother. But, she caught wind of it because she saw him shopping online at a fairly expensive clothing store, called him out on how much money he was about to spend, and he replied with, ""No \[my sister\] said she'd help me with my loans, so I have some spending money."" When I mentioned this to my brother today, he said he didn't remember me doing that for him. 

  
Also, one of his pieces of advice was to stay clean and organized. This is hilarious, because he is a grade A slob (nothing wrong with that!) and I am OCD-level clean. I told him that, and he got argumentative about it, and specifically called me out for leaving an empty coffee mug in the sink instead of washing it right away, at our parents' house this holiday break. It's petty on its own, but growing up, we were in an antiquated immigrant household, with standardized gender roles. That meant that I, the girl, helped set the table and clean it up after, throughout our childhoods, while my brother did nothing. It was also expected of my to do household chores, have a clean room, again, while my brother did nothing. The fact that he called me out for leaving a mug in the sink now that we are both adults, after that upbringing, has me fuming. On top of that, my mom RAVES about how helpful my brother is around the house whenever he visits (he is), but when I do the same, it goes unnoticed. 

  
All this to say, my family is here for me and wants to help me, but all three attempted to do this by arbitrarily yelling without knowing the facts about my situation (they don't really ask where exactly I am in my job search or what my future plans are etc. They just assume incorrectly). And, I acknowledge I am lucky to even have family who is here for me, but I grew up in a toxic environment that targeted me as the girl more so than my brother, as well as with an abusive mother (towards me, not my brother) and instead of acknowledging the facts, they will do any mental gymnastics necessary to avoid all accountability and just paint me as the crazy/lazy/unstable daughter. There is nothing left in me to fight for the truth with them, anymore. 

  
I guess the over-reaction, since I didn't really do anything, is the sense of injustice and defiance that I am feeling over where I stand and have stood in the context of my nuclear family. I am reflecting on my own patterns: I think I have been desperate for their approval or for a change in the overall dynamic, and now I feel done with trying to explain myself. They are free to misunderstand and judge me. 

  
**TL;DR** All three of my immediate family members ripped into me pretty hard about the state of my life, which to be fair, is pretty abysmal, but blame and insult me without any acknowledgement of how I've been treated by them all my life, or any capacity to stop yelling for like two seconds to listen to me so that I can tell them the facts about my current situation and inform them.

\- On the website it states that you get $100 to use at the resort and free breakfast for 2 each day of your stay. When we got there we were handed a letter that said the same thing, then the front desk person said the breakfast credit was capped at $85- for our entire stay   
\- The restuarant does a buffet for breakfast, which was constantly out of food, basic, didn't have cutlery and while there were 7 staff on, was a total shit show. ... the buffet breakfast itself is \~$25 a person (with an additional $5 per person for coffee).  
\- The resort also charges a $45 a night parking fee and a $45 a night resort fee.  
So this was adding \~50% to the cost immediately.   
\- Then we got to the room. We were ""upgraded"" to a room facing the marina - which overlooks the kids pool. Ugh. All the rooms are the same so a bogus upgrade.  
\- Everything in the room has a price tag on it, the water bottles, laundry bags, everything. It was like being inside a store.  
\- When checking out, the couple ahead of us where told they couldn't use the $100 credit towards their parking (which they had planned to do) and since they were checking out, the credit was then wasted.

1q0lhuc,https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1q0lhuc/the_black_wolf_by_louise_penny/,The Black Wolf by Louise Penny,"ETA:  this contains a lot of spoilers. 

My review of [The Grey Wolf](https://old.reddit.com/r/books/comments/1gzmmvq/the_grey_wolf_by_louise_penny/) complained about a number of improbable coincidences and bizarre behaviors. I was about 40% into this sequel and the movie mob plot line was going strong and I thought, aha, maybe she will actually revisit some of those nonsensical dangling threads and explain them! She did not. Almost none of the complaints i listed last year were explained. Mob-adjacent murder nun? Seemingly benevolent monk treats his niece like crap resulting in a lifelong estrangement and her turning into a supervillain?  Homeless shelter/Paolo subplot?  The newspaper prints a recipe featuring an obscure liquor that is also used as a secret message? Apparently all these ridiculous things were actually coincidences because none of them were revisited. 

Cons: 

- multiple flip-flops in identification of the Bad Guy. Happened too many times, I ran out of patience. 

- Why are there three female police officers with the names Yvette, Isobelle, (ETA: this is like having 3 characters who are named John, Jacob, and Joseph.  Names are too similar). and Evelyn? A small quibble but increased friction while reading. 

- Nobody in three pines really needed to be in this book.  

- Moretti fizzled, his capture was anticlimactic, and the capture of the correct planes was confusing. 

- Motivation: why. Narrator actually explains why the PM wouldn’t take these actions, with convincing reasoning. He is recently elected. He is charismatic. He is a liberal politician (and yet he takes actions that would be 100% believable as the actions of a contemporary conservative politician). He is*already in power*. So *why* does he orchestrate a mass murder and treason?  Literally why?  Is it for money? Blackmail?  It’s completely unconvincing and unexplained, they just realize it had to be him. 

- US subplot/conspirators unexplained. Who killed the general and why?  Was the President involved?

- Evelyn and Yvette are apparently dating at the end of the book?!?  Just dropped in there without elaboration. Excuse me, they are boss and employee AND I don’t think that was breadcrumbed at all even though there were viewpoint sections from each of them. 

- It’s not actually a secret that the US has invasion plans for about every country and runs war games on them. I’m not exactly a DC insider and I know about that. 

Please allow me to explain that I have *no problem* believing that people exist who make terrorist attacks or plan political coups. I just believe they would have motivations like greed or power-madness or revenge or whatever - motivations that would actually have evidenced themselves in their previous conduct. It’s not as if politicians are out there pretending to be good people to cover their true motivations these days. They are *openly* corrupt and greedy and authoritarian.  Penny’s failure to engage with this new reality is the big disappointment here. She definitely wanted to deal with the current political situation but because she set this book in an alternate reality with a different US President the math doesn’t work. It’s all very well to talk about climate threat but that’s kind of ‘by the way’ when it comes to current US administration actions/words towards Canada. 

Pro: One of the redeeming qualities of this book is that Gamache wasn’t betrayed by an old friend who turns out to have been a corrupt murderer all along. 

The Evelyn Tardiff subplot and her true allegiance was handled well and was suspenseful. (But in thinking over it, did it matter?  Every action she took could have been interpreted either way. In the end she was only taken out by Moretti because she was discovered taking clandestine photographs of him - photographs that didn’t actually make a difference, only confirmed what had been deduced through other data. Her capture/rescue was surprisingly low stakes as a result.) 

- The short-lived ambiguity about Agent Nichol was more interesting. 

-  I enjoyed Shona and thought she was well-used. 

- Ruth appears in her more *compos menti* form, which is much more interesting. 

- The device of the Opera House was great and used to very good effect

- Fewer of the ridiculous behaviors or leaps of reasoning from previous book, I didn’t notice any egregious editing lapses along the lines of the coffee cup or the repeated lake scene. 

Penny’s outstanding strengths in the past were:

1) the charming atmosphere of Three Pines (which can only be stretched to cover so many murder plots)

2) her treatment of art and artists

3) emotional depth of character interactions

4) the friction inherent in the French/English population divide

None of the above have been showcased by her more recent books. If I were Penny’s editor I would suggest her next book refocus on one of the above. Something that takes her characters completely out of the national stage like a locked room mystery or a bottle play. 

Of course I am not her editor and I hope she never reads this, actually, because she seems like a really nice person who shouldn’t b reading opinions of her work from randos online, that’s a recipe for unhappiness. I wish her only the best and I understand why she’s taken the directional changes that she did, I just wasn’t able to personally go along with the ride.",2,1767209820.0,books,0,0.75,False

1q0lglg,https://i.redd.it/y6265wutdlag1.jpeg,My 2025 reading wrap up! Some non romantasy included!,"It's a bell curve now that I'm looking at it. 4 is my usual rating, a 4 means I liked it, nothing necessarily wrong with it but it didn't blow me out of the water. Anything over a 4 has that something extra special.

I don't stick solely to romantasy, but I do mainly read fiction. Fantasy/romance are my two biggest genres, I also really enjoy YA.

Best read of the year was {Voyage of the Damned}. I LOVE this book. Magic, murder, diversity, LBGTQ characters, romance. What's not to love?

Worst read of the year was {Big Nick Energy}, read it for an irl romance book club. If not for book club I would have DNF'd. The MMC was weirdly possessive of the FMC and her young children.

Surprisingly didn't DNF any books this year!

The books I was most pleasantly surprised by were {Rose in Chains}, {Battle of the Bookstores}, {Our Infinite Fates}, and {Cursed in Love}. Didn’t think I’d be able to tolerate the slavery aspect of Rose in Chains but I don’t hate it! I loved HP growing up so it was fun to read published dramione fanfiction lol. Cursed in Love was an absolutely wild ride. The tone was all over the place. It was a lot of fun. 

Finished {Quicksilver} this morning to hit my goal of 75/75 books. I have some questions about potential plot holes if anyone wants to discuss ! I feel like quicksilver is divisive here but I liked it for the most part!",2,1767209726.0,fantasyromance,3,1.0,False

Water colors swirling, dancing having fun! 

This is about one table and intimate circle where in the introverts can quietly do new brush art techniques which dont need skilled hand movement and lots of textures or shapes get created simply using tools or ways of throwing color on sheet.

1q0lf45,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1q0lf45/im_just_irritated/,I'm just irritated,"Yesterday my roommate messaged me asking me to care for her dog overnight tonight because she's going out. F any New Year's plans I might have had, right? They also assumed I'd be off work, luckily I am but that isn't usually the case as I work retail.

But I didn't want to look like an asshole because I was debating on whether to go to the party I was invited to and was probably going to just stay home anyways.

Still, though, from the moment they brought this dog home, they have been using me as a free pet sitter with nothing in exchange. No money, no decrease in rent payment. My roommate always says ""I'll send you some money or get you something nice"" but has only ever follow through on that maybe 3 times in the last 2^1/2 years and it was only $5-10 each time. 

So I messaged her back and told her that it was kind of a short notice but I'll let her know, and she hits me back with a ""Let me know ASAP so that I can get someone else to do it if not."" I'm sorry, you gave me less than a 24-hour notice to ask me to do something on New Year's Eve and are telling me to let you know ""ASAP""???

I decide I'd rather stay home than go to a party, so I message her and let her know that I'll do it but to please grab me a coffee. She says ""you help so much with the dog, so yes, I'll get you a coffee, it's the least I can do.""

Cut to a few hours later, they (she and her bf) think I'm asleep, and I can hear them (mainly the bf) talking shit about me in the livingroom.

""She said she wouldn't watch the dog unless you got her a coffee?"" 

""So you have to buy her something in order to convince her to get off her ass.""

""She's gonna be home anyways, I don't see why she can't just do it."" 

A bunch of things along those lines and meaner, basically angry that I asked her to buy a $6 coffee in exchange for clearing up my New Year's plans and disturbing my sleep waking up every 2 hours to care for their dog on less than a 24-hour notice.

What doesn't help is that their expectations of me caring for the dog are higher than of themselves. They'll lay in bed for 14 hours without taking the dog out once, but I have to take it out every 2 hours sharp under my care. They don't play with the dog nor exercise it, but they want me to play with it and possibly take it for a walk. Etc etc. ",22,1767209616.0,badroommates,22,1.0,False

1q0ldp2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0ldp2,31 vs. 35. About 205lbs down to 175lbs,"I was a former college athlete with truly awful eating habits. Almost every meal was either fast food and/or something fried. I poured tons of sugar in my coffee. I all but stopped exercising, etc. I’d been steadily gaining weight for years, then Covid happened and I ballooned up to probably somewhere around 230lbs at my heaviest (which is nearly obese for my height). Diabetes runs in my family and I was already showing some troubling signs, not to mention the general discomfort that comes from being overweight and out of shape. 

Mid-2021 I tried exercising again. It was humiliating and overwhelming. I could barely get through 30 minutes of a mildly intense workout without being totally exhausted. It took more than 2 years, truly, for me to get to a place that looked like substantial progress. The issue? You can probably guess. I wasn’t willing to change my lifestyle, namely my food choices. 

I think a lot of people would be surprised to know my current diet isn’t crazy restrictive. I don’t count calories or macros. I don’t follow a particular meal plan, or eliminate a particular food group (i.e. carbs). Honestly, the initial weight loss came from making basic changes. I mostly cut out fast food, and started eating oatmeal for breakfast. I’ve been able to maintain my weight through a healthy, but realistic routine. I lift weights 4-5 times a week, walk a few miles intermittently 1-2 days. I do let myself have something like chicken strips and fries when I want to, but that’s mixed in with leaner meals and a protein focused approach (ground beef, turkey). 

Before you ask, I’ve been taking creatine for almost a year. I also take a BCAA. Those are my only supplements. It’s also important to remember that with my background in sports, I had a pretty good foundation as far as my build and general muscularity. It also helps that I’m short (5’8). This isn’t me saying my progress is particularly impressive, only that I know we all have different bodies and they respond differently.

1q0lbs0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0lbs0,My dream app finally realized,"I struggle to find the “quick” way to explain this idea. Basically it is like geocaching, but instead of Tupperware in the woods, you can choose ANY category to find and collect. 

Many people try to visit every National Park, or see a game at every MLB stadium. But, beyond that, your thing might be wineries, visiting one (or more) every time you travel. Or, perhaps you are hunting for Zoltar fortune telling machines. Pickleball courts. Dive bars. Mountain peaks. Independent book stores. Sushi restaurants. Anything. 

I break it down into three major functions

* Discover - Arrive in a new city, open up the app and discover all the locations that match your categories on the map near you

* Log - Just like Instagram, you can snap a photo and add your caption - get out there and have some fun 

* Share - now you have a map with pins in all the locations you visited, much easier to share than scrolling down a timeline to find those pics of your trip to Hawaii

I’ve vibe-coded all the basic functions in and smashed through bugs and user interface issues to the point where it works just about the way I want, although there are infinite features/upgrades I have in mind. But, for now, I have gotten the MVP up and running. 

Besides sharing this passion with people, and having fun “competing” with others to find the most Tiki Bars in the world, I really would love more people to play so I can find every last little nuance that needs some TLC before I push to the next step to get this packaged up for the real App Store

After years of trying to work with expensive developers with nothing to show for it, I took things into my own hands and two months later I have something I am really proud of. After a few false starts, I did most of the work with Claude Code and use supabase for the backend. My big issue was the original AI, and even Claude.ai made a giant JS file that became too large to even view, much less edit. So, I rebuilt the thing from the ground up, with lessons I learned here, most importantly discussing/planning every step BEFORE coding. File structure, and making sure each small file stuck to its lane. Also, I used the AI to teach me all about Github, which turns out is a key part of any project like this. 388 pull requests to be exact. Also, supabase has an AI tech help function so I used that a lot to learn about RLS (row level security) and how to properly implement a database for this project. And, many many lessons from posters here, including “things that can go wrong” and “mistakes vibe coded projects make”, going back a lot to Claude to make sure we were not making those mistakes. 

One of the biggest struggles I had was every single function that used data called the supabase tables on their own, which was a nightmare for login status and in addition to needing to “refresh” the browser after every click, eventually it just stopped working. I did speak to a legit full stack developer for help and they taught me about a database gateway, one function that has access to the database, that every other function needs to use if they want to interface with data. This, and the giant JS file were the two biggest reasons for the complete rebuild. Annoying, but by the third or fourth restart, I felt I had learned a lot more than I would have if I had just “vibed” it through on the first go. 

Also, with a blind friend, I learned about a lot of accessibility options and spent time making sure the whole thing was up to the current standards. That was educational in its own right. 

And, to note, I did all this on an iPad, without an F12key for viewing a browser console, so used all Toast alerts for debugging. Getting Claude to “remember” this constraint warrants a whole ‘nother post, haha

I have a sub here for updates and some attempt at community with r/yoinkadventures and would love anyone interested to jump in and have fun with this, helping me to get it ready for app submission and throwing any cool ideas for improvement my way

If you have two tiny things you can’t lose (for example I needed the pool filter to run 24 hours straight during a treatment once, and I had to take the two tiny pins off of the timer but losing them would have been a catastrophe) then put them in a baggie and label it. It becomes much larger and impossible to accidentally throw away or lose because it says what it is. Keep a box of baggies in the junk spot with the marker inside its own designated baggy up front, and it’ll make it really easy to stay on top of. As soon as you think to yourself, “I don’t know where to store this.” then BOOM - baggy, marker, junk drawer. ",9,1767209349.0,ADHD,1,1.0,False

The year 2025 was definitely a successful one for us, we have managed to finally conclude the Soyuzniki by adding full content for Xinjiang, Mongolia, Finland and Pribaltika (thus also opening the case of communist content within the mod), we have introduced a number of changes including the global events overhaul, ideologies overhaul and also a number of smaller overhauls like the one for technologies research, manpower in the logistics and also further changes to the map. This year was also the time when we finally managed to find time to properly play this mod in multiplayer games which resulted in a huge wave of quality of life changes that were just coming straight for several months making the general feeling of playing this mod a much more pleasurable one, I deeply hope so. Finally this year has brought us the compatibility updates to both Gotteramerung and No Compromise, No Surrender. I am very glad with how development on the mod went this year, that I finally had some opportunities to enjoy playing it with friends and see them having fun, that some of the long planned ideas like aforementioned overhauls and manpower mechanics were finally realised.

The year 2026 which is about to start will hopefully bring us the end of the basic overhaul updates i.e. I still plan to rework some of the focus trees to include greater number of possible factions they can join if circumstances allow it (like for example to give nations like Yugoslavia a greater choice than just being members of Soyuzniki), I want to include a greater number of features connected to the NCNS new features, I want to rework Russia to give greater amount of content for Spiridinova path and add communist content for Russia, I want to change who sends volunteers to war and how it should work. Out of more content wise updates I have both complete Chinese and French overhaul planned out already, I have plans for British rework that will allow us to add content for Ireland, Nigeria and realise Middle Eastern overhaul, there are also planned out content pack updates for West Africa and Aegean Sea. Out of personal projects of the dev team members there is also planned Spanish overhaul and Brazilian update among other things.   
There is a lot of work I hope we will be able to realise this year and add for all of you to enjoy. So please stay tuned, support us if you want by either funding us on Coffee or by joining the dev team, we can use all the help but a good word is also fine. Thank you for following us, for playing the mod, I hope you enjoyed it this year and will continue enjoying it next year.

The weight of a thousand stares bore down on Jiang as he walked with Lenore through Silverton proper. He kept his spine straight and his shoulders squared, letting the hostility wash over him like water off an oilskin duster.

His tinted glasses no longer acted as the shield they once did. Before, white folks' ignorance was like armor; they’d squint, unsure, guessing Native or Mexican. Now, in a town filled with fear, the glasses made him look like someone hiding something. 

He didn't like being marked, and neither did Len.

From what he gathered from Mr. Chu and what Lenore gathered from Mrs. Chu, Carla wanted to raise her child, Ute, to pass down her heritage and culture.

Jiang considered Boone's wish to keep the child in Silverton to be beyond dishonorable. To tear a child away from its mother’s culture was like the Manchu forcing the queue on the Han, an act of submission masked as order, an erasure disguised as love. 

Even if Boone had good intentions, the outcome was a prison for the soul. The thought of that love, distorted into a tool of erasure, clenched his jaw. 

A memory came up, as sharp as a piece of porcelain. 

The weight of Toopah’s hand on his shoulder, the muted command to hide the girls. He was the guardian because he was unseen. A Chinese boy in an Ahwahneechee home, the agent would ignore him and continue their search.

Holding his breath in the dark, with their muffled whimpers in his ears, the earthy taste of dust and salt on his tongue. 

Or Aa Ba’s low voice, recounting the Catholic missionaries in Guangdong. How church crosses were a prelude to foreign guns and the sweet, suffocating smell of opium.

He understood the urge to preserve. Everywhere, the fight was the same: to defend a way of life while the country was dismantling, bleaching, and labeling what it deemed savage or heathen.

It all added up. Sheriff Andy’s failure to investigate, even if he saw Carla as a daughter. In the ledger of this land, people like her, people like us, didn’t merit an entry. 

They entered the sheriff's office. The room reeked of stale cigarettes; Deputy Beagle, Boone, Vargas, and Marshal Jackson were nowhere to be seen. Compared to yesterday’s crowd, the office seemed empty.

Sheriff Andy sat alone at his desk, studying a map with a cigarette between his fingers. The late-morning rays warmed his dark brown skin.

His finger traced a line on the map, brows furrowed in thought, unaware of anyone's presence until the hinges squeaked when Jiang closed the door behind them. 

Jiang slouched his shoulders and stuffed his hands into his duster pockets. He needed to understand how the sheriff used authority. So he played into the quiet stereotype, keeping his tinted glasses on.

“How’d the perimeter check go, Beagle?”

The grandfather clock struck eleven. At last, the sheriff's gaze lifted. Sheriff Andy’s gaze met Len's, then his. 

“I did not realize a man of my status could be a lawman,” Jiang said, a hint of humor in his voice. 

The sheriff’s lip twitched in amusement as he took a long drag from his cigarette. He exhaled a slow curl of smoke toward the ceiling, then ground the butt out in the ashtray. “Neither did I. But here we are.”

Lenore hooked her thumbs in her belt loops. “As much as I enjoy small talk, sheriff—we got some questions ya might answer.”

The sheriff leaned back in his chair, crossing his arms. His focus remained on Jiang, whom he saw as the real threat. 

He might be dangerous, but she was too, if given the chance. The sheriff viewed Len as a hotheaded, loudmouthed farmhand who didn't understand her place among adults.

“Figured this wasn’t a social call,” Andy said, his gaze still fixed on Jiang. “What do you want to know?”

He stepped forward, shoulders relaxed, pretending to be compliant. The act was still ongoing, but less convincing now. A flicker of recognition flashed across the sheriff’s face, as if he’d just seen a ghost.

“I see what you’re doing, Mr. Hsu,” he said, fingers drumming on his arm. “Colored man learns to make himself small. White folks in charge don’t like being questioned. The difference is, my authority’s always on trial—for being a negro.”

“Don’t give me the ‘quiet John Chinaman’ routine in here,” Andy said, squaring his shoulders. “I see the bounty hunter behind the act.”

Jiang’s shoulders stayed slack as he shifted his weight. “But you are a man with power, a badge, and we are men without. My partner and I should respect your badge.”

His lips curled into a slight smile. “Can’t say you weren’t raised with manners.” Andy straightened his posture, his gaze lingering on Jiang, his expression saying, Keep your partner in line. He gave a single, slow nod, granting them the floor.

“We are looking into the disappearance of Carla Boone, sheriff,” Jiang said, his voice level. “We were told you might have information.”

Lenore stepped forward, just half a pace, her thumbs still hooked in her belt loops. “We heard she was pregnant.”

The sheriff smoothed the map. His face softened as regret spread across it. His hands went still, resting flat on the paper. When he looked up, the tough lawman had returned.

""Who told you that?"" he asked, his voice soft.

“Deputy Boone inquired that we look into his wife's disappearance,” Jiang spoke up.

The sheriff clasped his hands on the map. “So he's still looking,” he said, his voice going soft. “What do you want to know?”

Jiang glanced at Lenore, clasping his hands together at his waist. She replied with a tilt of her chin. 

“Sheriff, how close were you to Carla?” he asked.

Sheriff Andy leaned back in his chair, the old wood creaking. His professional mask slipped, revealing a moment of tiredness. The wrinkles on his face deepened into his skin, aging him further.

“Close?” he said, his voice lower now. “I raised that boy. Promised his father I would, right before the man died in my arms at Petersburg. Boone was closed off for a long time. Hardened. Then he met Carla.” 

A faint, almost wistful smile touched his lips, gone as quickly as it came. “Was like watchin’ a damned flower bloom in a desert. She was tough, mind you.

Well, let's say that a year ago I *thought* I was entering maintenance. I ended 2024 at 150 lb. after having started at 282 lb. I was ecstatic. Maintenance is, of course, trial and error. Many people start titrating down or spacing out their doses. I didn't want to do either, because I didn't have any side effects on 15 mg and I was experiencing normal hunger and satiety, and didn't have any food noise. I was confident that I could up my calorie intake to a level that would allow me to maintain my weight. 

It took a few months to figure out how to balance my energy intake and expenditure, and I  reached the top of what would ultimately be my final maintenance range in March. 

During the last year, I've really learned to trust my hunger cues. There have been times when I feel hungrier than I normally do. At first, it made me nervous. But consistently I have noticed that when I ignore them and stick to what I *thought* I should have eaten, I lose weight. When I act on those hunger cues, I do still feel satiety and I don't lose weight--and I also haven't gained weight when doing that. It gets said again and again, but hunger really isn't the enemy. It's just your body communicating that it needs nutrition. 

I also still do not have food noise. To me, food noise is that obsessive compulsion to over consume food that is available to you. It's part of the pathology of obesity that occurs in your hypothalamus, ramping up your hunger hormones to a level that cannot be ignored--a survival instinct just like a sharp intake of air after you've held your breath too long. 

I do occasionally have a craving for something specific. I have learned to honor those, but choose to do so in moderation. And they're not frequent. Most recently, it was a box of dark chocolate cordial cherries (my mother used to love those, so they're sentimental, too). 

2025 was also the year that I started to take running more seriously. During my active weight loss, I hiked a lot--like 5 miles every day. For me, running works better for me in maintenance. It helps keep my cardiovascular fitness up but it doesn't expend too many calories. I've also walked a 5k and ran two this year, and am looking forward to doing more in 2026. 

All of my lab results normalized in 2025. At the end of 2024, I still had a couple of outliers. But at my last appointment, everything was good. Fatty liver, cholesterol, and blood pressure were all in remission and normal. 

Also in 2025, some of the things that originally had been aversions for me came back. I used to regularly enjoy watching YouTube videos about cars and technology, but always did so while binge eating. Zepbound took away any need for binge eating, but also I didn't want to watch the content I used to. I have resumed my passion for cars and tech, but don't need to binge while doing so. I also was a regular enjoyer of coffee, but for most of 2024 the most I wanted was a coffee-flavored protein shake. I am now enjoying coffee very regularly. 

I also discovered this year that I actually *do* have an interest in fashion, and am learning to enjoy expressing myself that way. Before I was just happy to find something that fit and kind of ""hid"" my larger body. It's been a fun journey to figure that out. 

Yes, I do have some loose skin (stomach and upper thighs, mostly). It doesn't really bother me. I have men's shape wear that helps keep it from moving too much. It has improved some over time, and I told myself in early 2025 that I would give it a year and then re-evaluate, but I probably won't pursue surgery at this point. 

So 2026 is coming tonight, and it's the second year that I have no resolutions related to my weight or my body. I never, ever thought that would be possible. ",36,1767208516.0,Zepbound,7,0.97,False

We decided to break up so that Mike could figure out what he wanted and so that I could focus on dealing with some career things. We essentially left the door open and said maybe we’d be together one day again if the circumstances were right and have continued to say “I love you” through this entire process. 

Here we are two months later and I went on a couple dates with a guy I met at a local coffee shop and ended up sleeping with him. (I did let the new guy know that I was fresh out of a relationship and not looking for something serious btw.) Even though I am single and well within my rights to see whoever I want, I feel so guilty and disgusting. I still love Mike so much and would get back with him in a heartbeat if he would take me back. 

Mike and I have been occasionally seeing each other as friends but it has been completely platonic. The last time I saw him I told him about my dates but told him that I wasn’t interested in the new guy and that I missed him and the door is wide open for me. I did not however tell him about the hookup. 

Mike is still unsure what he wants and said he cannot get back into a relationship in the near future but that he still loves me a lot. This makes me feel even worse for what I did because I love him too. My question is- if we end up seeing each other romantically or getting back together, do I need to tell him that I slept with someone else while we were broken up or is that none of his business??",3,1767208471.0,relationship_advice,30,0.62,False

In this video, I do a full build and hands-on review of the Vertagear SL5800 RS Audi Edition gaming chair, then put it up against two other premium ergonomic gaming chairs to see how it really stacks up.



This isn’t a quick unboxing or first impression. It’s a real gaming chair review focused on comfort, design, and long-term usability, including Vertagear’s signature features like:



ContourMax adjustable lumbar support

VertaAir seat technology for airflow and pressure relief

HygennX coffee ground fiber material designed to reduce odor and improve cooling

Additional RGB support through Vertagear’s upgradeable lighting system



Official Audi branding, materials, and design influence



After the build, I compare the SL5800 RS Audi Edition with other high-end gaming chairs, breaking down differences in lumbar support, seat contouring, adjustability, warranty, and overall value without the marketing fluff.

1q0kz67,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0kz67,Need help designing my apartment's living room,"I (M 31 single) am looking to style my 1 bed 1 bath apartment's living room so that it feels spacious and open while also allowing me to practice my hobbies (tv, read, piano and guitar) and exercise (just adjustable dumbbells). 

I already have the following

\-A black/chrome Sigurd Resell falcon chair with an ottoman

\-Yamaha P105 digital piano

\-Rolling book stand

\-Rotating bookstand

\-1 guitar and 1 bass amp

\-Adjustable dumbells (no rack for it yet)

These are my questions:

1). What kind of couch and coffee table should get (size/color) and where it should be placed to go well with the falcon chair. A loveseat is also an option as a small couch given that I'm trying to fit quite a bit of things in this living room

I did see a nice grey woven couch on the fb marketplace that is 78"" x 38"" and I don't know if that would be too big for my room. Sorry for not providing measurements, I just have the photos I took of the unit, but the total sq ft is approx 692, but my main concern is the living room, which I don't know the size).

2). Where the tv should be placed. I did buy a wall mounting bracket for the tv to save floorspace. I don't want to mount it too far from the couch  

3). Where my falcon chair should be placed. I was thinking the corner next to the window with a plant and my rolling bookshelf next to it. I don't want it to feel crammed when I add in the sofa and coffee table

4). The size/color/placement of the rug. I think black/white/grey angular furniture is the look i'm going for but I don't mind throwing in some accent colors I just don't really know how to style it. I am looking into mounting shelves on the wall to save some floorspace. 

5). Any tips or additional things I should get. I was thinking of placing a coat hanger next to the door but then I saw ikea has this rack that mounts on the wall and I can probably get that to save some space. I don't know if I should get a small drawer and a lamp but I don't want to put too many things in this space. 

Thank you! and sorry I don't have the best drawing skills either

Sorry for the long question. 

My partner and I of almost 3 years have been having a lot of issues in the past year and I’ve been trying my hardest to make it work and I feel like it’s breaking me down a lot lately and I don’t know if it’s worth trying any more or if I should still continue trying.

Our relationship has been a bit of a rollercoaster. When we first met I was mesmerized by her. She had an energy I hadn’t felt in a long time. Our first date for me was magical and romantic but for her she always mentions how she didn’t romance from it because it’s not like the movies where you go to a forest and you kiss under the moonlight and there may be a volcanic eruption.

And after going out for a couple of months she started feeling peer pressured by her female friends that being in her 20s is for having a “ho phase” and not being in relationships. Which lead to her dumping me and saying we should just be friends because she felt like she hasn’t slept with enough men.  And a couple weeks after that she calls me and says that she isn’t ready to let go of what we have and I gave her a second chance. Mind you, I’ve had a few similar situations in the past where exes felt like I was “stopping their freedom” and they want me back shortly after because the guys they were seeing were “trash” compared to me and my current partner is the first person I ever let back in. I let her back in because I thought I saw something really special in her

My partner is smart, creative, outspoken (but only with me and close friends), we both share the same political values and enjoys traveling. She  has so many qualities I want in a person. And when she met me I was at my highest and I was in the best shape I had ever been in (mentally, physically and financially). But I digress.

After we get back together things started to go good until she didn’t like that I lived a bit far from her (we lived in two different cities at the time and I always came to see her on the weekends). So I work hard to try to find a job closer to her and I move to the same town as her 7 months into the relationship. Shortly after moving I get badly injured and some signs started to show that I ignored mainly because I like to give people the benefit of the doubt.

When I got injured she had a late period and as we were in the hospital she kept blaming me for the late period when she knows that if she wanted us to use protection I wouldn’t have said no. And then when it’s time to leave the hospital she leaves me to head home on my own because she felt like she needed some time alone even tho I just had a leg injury and I was struggling to walk. I was really shocked at the moment but I thought maybe she just doesn’t know how to handle tough personal situations and needed some time to process the whole thing.

As time passes I had to miss work at my job because of my injury and when I get back to work I’m given an impossible work schedule that limits my personal time which then caused some issues in the relationship about making time for each other. I started suffering from severe burnout and my job decides to let me go and this was something that was really damaging to my pride and self worth. I had never been fired before and all my past employers would say that I was on of the best employees they ever had so this came as a major shock to me. I was feeling really down about this and it took me 7 months to find another job and I had basically spent all of my savings trying to survive while being unemployed.

When I lost my job both of us were struggling to find work and I thought we would be each others support. I thought it was great at first because we both were alone in this city and didn’t really have anyone to confide to.

During this tough period she started suffering with depression and she started pushing me away. You can read more about that on my last post for a year ago if you’re interested.

When I finally get a job her first comment was “men always get things first” even tho this was a minimum wage job that I wasn’t happy about she thought it was the perfect time for such a comment even tho she has been applying for way more competitive roles than me. And she knows I’ve been struggling to find work and I applied for hundreds of jobs (most of which didn’t interests me at all) with only rejections and only 5 interviews in that 7 month period.

Soon after I get my job issues about our sex life arise (which had spoken about previously) and she starts telling me that if I don’t start man handling her in the bedroom the way she imagines her sex life being she won’t want to be with me. I step up to the challenge because I want her to feel as satisfied as I do. And after this happens she develops a habit of comparing. She compared everything I did and we do together to other people which for me is a very bad habit.

We then have a big fight about the sexual situation which leads to her telling “maybe you don’t know how to have sex” and she later in the same argument she said “maybe we should take a break and you can consider if I’m the right man for her” that made me really angry. After she saw me storm out the house she chased me down and said “I think we should have an open relationship” that made me feel not only angry but humiliated. So we come to the conclusion we should spend a couple weeks apart to reconsider things. I told her that this separation for me isn’t a time for me to reconsider if I want to be with her, it’s time for me to think about how I can become more of what she wants in bed because I’ve had a bit of a traumatizing sexual past with one of my exes and I’ve been pretty afraid of being accused of anything that didn’t seem consensual or could be perceived as violence after we broke up so this was a big step for me. For her this break was about her considering if I’m the right man for which I told her that I don’t want her to do because it feels like an ultimatum to me.

After we meet again from the couple week separation she then ask me again if I think I can be that man for her and begrudgingly agreed because I didn’t want to lose what was the best some I ever dated but I asked her to give me time to grow and to stop comparing me to other men because it is very hurtful to me.  and she gave it a few days before she started complaining and comparing me to other men. Then her frustration lead to her criticizing other parts of my life and I began losing my self esteem to the lowest it’s been since I was in middle school when I felt completely worthless. 

And this low self esteem lead to me making a few mistakes and I kept second guessing all of my actions. And now we have regular arguments and I would like it to stop. Our last argument lead to me getting super emotional and I ended punching a hole in the hotel wall. I’m usually pretty good at holding back my aggression but this time I really couldn’t stand the criticisms especially while I’m on holiday. 

She’s been super pessimistic about my aspirations while I have been really supportive of hers and it really hurts I can’t get the same support. 

I don’t think she’s being mean on purpose but I think she can’t see how much she hurts me even tho I have been really open and honest about the pain it causes. 

Me as a partner I cook for her on a regular basis, I make her coffee in the morning, I regularly pamper her. I help her with her work, her personal creative projects and any issue she’s suffering I will listen to her for hours and try to help if I can. Any time I want similar from her she acts like it’s a chore or I should be lucky that she’s doing this for a man. 

I want to make things work but I feel like I have to live up to standards that are impossible. She has inspired me in many ways but I feel like I don’t feel as confident as I used to after being with her.

Notes:  

* If we don't count Willie Mays' brief stint on the Birmingham Black Barons as him actually making his major league debut, and put him in the 1950's debut group instead of the 1940's group, he's comfortably atop that group, with 149.9 career fWAR.
* In a few other instances a player's brief cup of coffee in the final year of one decade pushes their debut into that decade, sometimes to their benefit, sometimes not. The biggest example of it not helping is Tim Raines having 6 appearances in 1979, all as a pinch runner without ever having an at-bat or playing in the field for a single batter, resulting in his 66.4 career fWAR just missing the cut in the 1970's group (0.1 out of 10th place) instead of ranking 8th in the 1980's group.
* The other players with at least 65 career fWAR to not make the cut are Andruw Jones and Manny Ramirez (11th and 12th in the 90's group, at 67.0 and 66.4 career fWAR), Tony Gwynn (11th in the 80's group, 65.0 career fWAR), and Dwight Evans (11th in the 70's group, 65.1 career fWAR)
* It's not totally impossible that Andrew McCutchen (2009 debut, 52.3 career fWAR) will have a random great year in his late 30's and jump onto the top 10 for the 2000's group. Or I guess if you think catcher framing is bullshit, then he's already on it.
* We can assume the 2010's ranking will change a bit over time (I'd happily bet on Aaron Judge getting into the top 2 and maybe passing Trout for #1) and a few players debuting later in the decade will make their way onto the top 10, with Juan Soto (2018 debut, 42.3 career fWAR) being the most obvious pick.
* Including Ohtani's pitching WAR isn't enough to get him into the 2010's top 10 yet, but he'll probably get there eventually.
* The 50's group is easily the strongest even if we're not counting Willie Mays among them, with three 100-WAR players and seven 80-WAR players, though it's a bit top-heavy and past that point resembles the back end of the other decades of the 20th century.
* The 00's group is easily the weakest- the 20th century groups all have at least as many 80-WAR players as they have 60-WAR players, and Chase Utley, the #3 in the 00's group, wouldn't crack the top 10 in any previous decade. The 10's group is mostly out-WAR'ing the 00's group at the same ranking even though they're all still active and likely to add to their totals a bit! Did taking amphetamines and steroids out of the game really do that much to stop these guys from playing well into their 30's like the earlier crowds did, or something?
* Put Lou Whitaker and Bobby Grich into the hall of fame already, dammit!",11,1767207983.0,baseball,8,1.0,False

1q0kqpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenStack/comments/1q0kqpp/is_the_breville_compact_wave_the_best_quiet/,Is the Breville Compact Wave the Best Quiet Microwave You Can Buy?,"I’ve been running the breville countertop microwave oven for a couple weeks in my own kitchen, and this BMO650SIL has basically replaced my old 0.9 cu ft “cheap box” unit. I’m a home appliance tech in Aurora and I test microwaves pretty regularly, mostly for real-life stuff like leftovers, coffee, and frozen meals, not showroom demos.

Compact size fit is legit: the footprint (about 17.3 x 19.1 x 11.5 in) works on a tighter counter, though the 29.8 lb weight makes it feel dense and not something you’ll slide around one-handed. Installation and placement was simple, but it likes a stable surface since the soft-close door changes how you “slam” a microwave shut.

Soft close door experience is the standout. The handle and door mechanism feel solid, and the door sort of pulls itself in quietly, no clang. Sound and quiet mode are also real: the fan and magnetron noise are muted, and you can disable the end-cycle beeps. In a small home, that matters.

Interface and controls are mostly a win. The time cook knob plus push-button panel makes quick adds and subtracts of seconds easy, even with greasy fingers. Preset functions exist, but I still default to manual time/power since presets are never perfect. Display visibility is clear from across the kitchen, no tiny dim digits.

Cooking performance at 900 watts is fine, not a blast furnace. Heating evenness is better than bargain units I’ve repaired, but it’s still a microwave, so thick leftovers need a stir. Design and aesthetics lean slight retro and actually looks nicer than most stainless-ish boxes.

Ease of cleaning is decent: smooth surfaces wipe down, but the edges around the door can catch splatter.

Child safety features are where reddit will argue. The door lock feature can auto-engage and force an extra button press before you can open after cooking. People disable it, but it’s annoying if you don’t want it.

Durability concerns: at least one long-term owner reported the display going to blank rectangles and the keypad/dial freezing, plus Breville not selling parts. That’s the big red flag for the price, which sits way above basic compact microwaves, closer to “premium toaster oven” money. Value for price depends on how much you care about quiet operation and the soft-close build versus the risk of an expensive e-waste situation later.",1,1767207822.0,KitchenStack,0,1.0,False

1q0kqai,https://www.reddit.com/r/AttractionDynamics/comments/1q0kqai/3_subtle_ways_to_create_attraction_with_anyone/,3 Subtle Ways to Create ATTRACTION With Anyone: The Psychology That Actually Works,"okay so I spent the last few months diving deep into attraction psychology because honestly I was tired of the contradictory advice everywhere. read books by actual researchers, listened to podcasts with legit behavioral scientists, watched way too many academic talks. turns out most dating advice is recycled garbage that misses the actual mechanisms of how humans connect.

here's what actually works (and why):

**1. strategic vulnerability beats confidence performance**

everyone says ""just be confident"" but that's incomplete. what actually creates connection is selective vulnerability at the right moments. not trauma dumping on date one, but showing you're human and not performing constantly.

the research backs this up. Dr. Brené Brown's work on vulnerability (she's done like 20 years of research on shame and connection at University of Houston) shows that people are drawn to authenticity way more than projected perfection. her book *Daring Greatly* breaks down how vulnerability is actually the birthplace of connection and trust. it's not about oversharing, it's about being willing to be seen. genuinely one of the most eye opening reads on human connection I've encountered.

practically this means: admit when you don't know something, share a genuine concern (not a manufactured humble brag), laugh at yourself when you mess up. the people worth attracting will respect this. the ones who don't weren't compatible anyway.

**2. create micro moments of presence**

most people are physically there but mentally elsewhere. scrolling, thinking about their response, planning their next move. real attraction happens in those tiny moments where someone feels genuinely seen and heard.

there's this concept in psychology called ""attunement"" that couples researcher Dr. John Gottman talks about (the guy who can predict divorce with 90% accuracy after watching couples for 15 minutes, wild). basically our brains are constantly making ""bids for connection"" throughout the day. small moments like ""look at that dog"" or sharing a random thought. most people ignore these or give half responses.

the people who consistently ""turn toward"" these bids create way stronger bonds. so when someone shares something, put your phone down. make eye contact. ask a follow up question that shows you actually processed what they said. sounds basic but like 90% of people fail at this constantly.

I started practicing this with everyone, not just dates. cashiers, coworkers, random conversations. it's honestly changed how people respond to me. feels less like a technique and more like actually being present in your own life.

**3. share novel experiences together (not dinner dates)**

here's where the neuroscience gets interesting. when you do something new or slightly adrenaline inducing with someone, your brain can misattribute the arousal to the person you're with. it's called the ""misattribution of arousal"" effect and was famously demonstrated in the Capilano Suspension Bridge study.

but beyond that, novel experiences create shared memories that bond people way faster than routine interactions. Dr. Arthur Aron's research at Stony Brook (the guy behind the ""36 questions that lead to love"" study) found that couples who regularly engage in novel and challenging activities together report higher relationship satisfaction.

so instead of another coffee date or bar hangup, suggest something neither of you have done. could be an odd museum, trying a new cuisine, taking a random class together, exploring a part of your city you've never been to. doesn't need to be expensive or elaborate, just different from the usual script.

this works platonically too btw. some of my closest friendships were solidified during random adventures, not sitting across from each other at restaurants having the same conversations.

**the actual key nobody talks about**

all these tactics are worthless if you're trying to manipulate someone into liking you. the uncomfortable truth is attraction isn't really about tricks, it's about becoming someone who's genuinely engaged with their own life and brings that energy to interactions.

people can smell desperation and inauthenticity from miles away. the goal isn't to perform attraction, it's to create conditions where authentic connection can happen. sometimes it will, sometimes it won't. that's the game.

**resources that helped me level up**

besides the books mentioned above, I've been using BeFreed lately. It's an AI learning app built by a team from Columbia that pulls from research papers, expert talks, and books to create personalized audio content based on what you want to improve. 

What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan feature. You can tell it your specific struggles with connection or communication, and it builds a structured plan from high quality sources. The depth customization is clutch, you can do a quick 10 minute summary or switch to a 40 minute deep dive with examples when something clicks. Also the voice options are weirdly addictive, there's this sarcastic narrator style that makes dense psychology research way more digestible during commutes.

It actually covers most of the relationship psychology books I mentioned, plus a bunch of other behavioral science content I wouldn't have found otherwise.

also worth mentioning the app Paired if you're already in a relationship and want to deepen attraction. it's basically daily questions and exercises backed by relationship research. helps maintain that curiosity and discovery phase even years in.

look, none of this guarantees anything because humans are complex and chemistry is weird and sometimes timing just sucks. but these approaches at least align with how our brains actually work rather than some outdated gender essentialist nonsense or surface level ""hold eye contact for exactly 3 seconds"" type advice.

try focusing on one of these for a week and see what shifts. worst case you become slightly better at connecting with humans generally. not the worst outcome.

1q0knch,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_NeitherFig2490/comments/1q0knch/the_character_story_chapter_1/,THE CHARACTER Story - Chapter 1 -,"On a gray winter evening in **2010**, the city breathed heavily, like an old creature groaning under the weight of years. The streets were narrow, the sidewalks worn, and the buildings were covered in a layer of dust and desolation. Here, in this forgotten corner of the world, lived Kyle, a young man in his mid-twenties, his sharp intellect shining in his eyes, yet hidden behind walls of doubt and anxiety. Kyle observed the world from the window of his small apartment, staring at the dim lights reflected on the glass, listening to the silence of the night, occasionally broken by the sound of a passing car or the bark of a stray dog. Inside, a constant struggle raged: between a desire to prove himself and a fear of failure, between grand dreams and a reality that grew narrower with each passing day.



Kyle didn't own much; his apartment barely fit a small bed and an old wooden desk, its walls bearing the marks of damp and peeling paint. He lived on the brink of bankruptcy, chasing temporary jobs and counting every coin in his pocket as rent and debt piled up. Every night, he went to sleep hoping tomorrow would bring a new opportunity, and every morning he woke up to find himself in the same cycle: job hunting, rejection letters, and a gnawing anxiety.



Kyle's apartment was like a small box of memories and worries. The walls were painted a faded white, long since lost their luster. A single window overlooked a narrow alley, letting in sunlight for only a few minutes each day before the shadows returned. On the wall opposite the window, Kyle hung an old painting from his college days, its lines as tangled as his thoughts, its colors as muted as his dreams. In the corner, a small desk was piled high with papers and rejection letters from various companies, above which a yellow lamp cast a dim light, barely enough to dispel the gloom.



Kyle spent most of his time in this room, reading, writing, or staring at the ceiling. Sometimes, he would get up to make himself a cheap cup of coffee and sit on the edge of the bed, listening to the rain beat against the windowpane. In those moments, he felt profoundly alone, as if the whole world had forgotten him. Yet, something inside him refused to give up: a tiny spark of hope, or perhaps a hidden stubbornness, that drove him to keep searching for a chance to change his life.

One night, while Kyle was browsing job websites on his old computer, an advertisement unlike any he had ever seen appeared. It was simple, without colors or pictures, written in black font on a white background: ""Night shift worker needed for a private hospital. Starts immediately. No experience required. Competitive salary. Call now."" There was a phone number at the end of the advertisement, but no company name or further details.

Kyle paused at the advertisement, a strange feeling stirring in his chest—a mixture of curiosity and suspicion. Why hadn't the ad named the hospital? And why did it specify night shifts only? Yet, his desperation had reached a point where he no longer had the luxury of choice. He picked up the phone and dialed the number with trembling fingers. It didn't ring for long; a quiet, indistinct voice came through: ""Hello, is this Kyle?"" He hesitated for a moment, then replied, ""Yes... I'm Kyle. I saw your job ad."" The response was swift: ""Yes, we were expecting you. You can come in tomorrow at 9:00 PM. The hospital is on Palm Street, Building 85. Don't forget your ID."" Then the line went dead.

Kyle sat staring at his phone for a few moments, trying to process what had happened. How did they know his name? And why hadn't they asked about his experience or qualifications? A shiver ran down his spine, but he convinced himself it was just a coincidence. Perhaps the ad was aimed at a group of job seekers, or maybe his name had appeared in some database. In the end, he had no other choice. He decided to go the next day, hoping this might be the opportunity he had been waiting for.



The following night, Kyle put on his only blue shirt and his faded black trousers. He walked through the darkened streets, watching the car headlights reflected on the wet pavements. It was cold, and the wind whipped through the dry leaves. The closer he got to Palm Street, the more silent and gloomy the city seemed to become. The buildings there were taller, their windows closed, their lights dim, as if they were silently observing the passersby.

When he reached building number 85, he paused for a moment in front of the main door. The building was unlike any other hospital he had seen: its glass facade was gleaming, almost too clean, without a trace of dust or fingerprints. Above the door, a metal plaque bore the hospital's name:

 "" Ravenhill Medical Center Hospital — Established in 1963."" The name was vaguely familiar, as if he had heard it in an old dream. He pushed the door open quietly and entered the lobby.

The hospital lobby was spacious and unusually bright. The white marble floor gleamed as if it had never been trodden upon. The walls were covered with modern paintings, their colors muted yet somewhat cool. In the corner, a receptionist sat behind a sleek glass desk, wearing a white coat and a surgical mask that covered half his face. There were no patients or visitors in the room; only a heavy silence filled the space.

Kyle walked over to the desk, and before he could say a word, the employee looked up and said, ""Hello, Kyle. We've been expecting you."" Kyle felt extremely flustered, but tried to appear normal: ""Thanks... I'm here for the job."" The employee pointed to an open register in front of him: ""Here, sign here."" Kyle looked at the register and saw his name already written in the new employee column, in neat and clear handwriting. He hesitated for a moment, then picked up the pen and signed next to his name.

""Your shift starts tonight,"" the clerk said calmly. ""The supervisor is waiting for you on the second floor. The elevator's there."" Then he went back to his work without looking at him again. Kyle felt something was off about the place: the excessive cleanliness, the silence, the way the clerk pronounced his name, the register with his name already on it. Nevertheless, he tried to convince himself it was just a coincidence, that this was probably the hospital's system.



Kyle walked to the elevator, pressed the button, and waited. The elevator was made of gleaming steel, its doors opening and closing silently. When he stepped inside, he noticed the control panel displayed only floor numbers, no signs or names. He pressed ""2,"" and the elevator felt ascend at an unusually slow pace. A large mirror on the back wall reflected his image distorted. For a moment, he thought his reflection was smirking at him, but he ignored it.

When he reached the second floor, he opened the door onto a long corridor lit by cool white lights. The floor was marble, and the walls were decorated with more paintings, this time featuring intricate geometric patterns. At the end of the corridor stood a tall man in a white coat, smiling mysteriously. Kyle approached him, and before he could speak, the man said, ""Welcome, Kyle. I'm the night supervisor. Come with me; I'll show you around."" Kyle followed the supervisor down the quiet corridors. Everything in the hospital was excessively clean; the smell of disinfectant was so strong it made him dizzy. The doors on either side of the corridor were tightly closed and made no sound. Occasionally, he could hear faint whispers coming from afar, but he couldn't pinpoint their source.

The supervisor stopped in front of a small room with a sign that read ""Night Watch Room."" He opened the door and gestured inside. ""This will be your office tonight. You'll be monitoring the cameras and noting anything unusual. If anything seems out of the ordinary, call me immediately."" Kyle entered the room and found it equipped with a large screen displaying images from the hospital's surveillance cameras. On the desk were a notebook and pen, and a wall clock hung above the screen.

Kyle glanced at the clock and noticed it was three in the morning, but it wasn't moving. Its hands were frozen, as if time had stopped at that moment. He tried to turn it with his hand, but it wouldn't respond. A shiver ran through him, but he tried to appear calm. He sat down in the chair and began watching the screens.

As he watched the monitors, Kyle noticed that some doors were opening and closing on their own, for no apparent reason. On one monitor, he saw a shadow quickly pass in front of the camera, but when he replayed the scene, he saw nothing. On another monitor, he noticed that a corridor remained lit the entire time, even though no one was in it. He tried to jot these observations down in his notebook, but found that the first page had his name and the date on it, written in a handwriting he didn't recognize.



At that moment, a young nurse entered, carrying a file. She was wearing a white uniform, and her face was pale as if she hadn't slept in days. ""Do you need anything, Kyle?"" she asked in a quiet voice. ""No... I'm just checking the cameras,"" he replied hesitantly. She gave a faint smile and said, ""If you notice anything unusual, don't hesitate to call us. We're always here."" Then she left and closed the door behind her.



Kyle sensed something was off about the employees' behavior: their answers were vague, their stares were cold, as if they knew something they didn't want to reveal. He tried to convince himself it was just initial jitters, but his anxiety was growing.



At midnight, the supervisor came in again and sat in front of him. He said in a quiet voice, but with a note of warning: ""Kyle, in this place, there are rules that you must abide by. Do not leave the room unless you have to. If you hear strange noises, ignore them. And if you see something that cannot be explained, write it down in the notebook and do not talk about it with anyone.""



Kyle hesitated for a moment, then said, ""Has anything happened here before? I mean... why all these rules?"" The supervisor smiled mysteriously and said, ""Every place has its secrets, Kyle. The hospital is old, founded in 1963, and has seen a lot. Don't worry, you'll get used to it soon."" Then he got up and left the room, leaving Kyle alone with his thoughts.



At that moment, Kyle sensed that the words he had heard held more than one meaning. There was something in the supervisor's tone that suggested what was happening here was not just routine procedure, but that there was a secret hidden within the walls of this place.



As the hours passed, Kyle began to feel that time had lost its meaning. The clock on the wall didn't move, the night never ended, and the lights never dimmed. At one point, he noticed that his name was written on every single piece of paper in the room, even on old files. He tried to ignore it, but he couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching him.

On one of the screens, he saw a door slowly opening, even though he was certain it had been closed just minutes before. He left the room to investigate and found the hallway empty and all the doors locked. When he returned to the room, he discovered that his notebook had been moved and the page on which he had written his notes had been torn out and disappeared.

At that moment, he heard a faint sound coming from the corridor: unintelligible whispers, like an echo of distant voices. He moved closer to the door and put his ear to it. He heard his name called in a faint voice: ***""Kyle... Kyle...""*** He stepped back, his heart pounding. He tried to convince himself that it was just his imagination, but the fear inside him was growing.

At the clock's stillness, as Kyle watched the screens, the lights in the corridors suddenly went out. Darkness reigned for a few moments, then the lights came back on, but the image on the screen had changed: a tall man in a black coat appeared, standing in the middle of the corridor, staring directly at the camera. His face was not clear, but his eyes were shining with an eerie light.

Kyle tried to scream, but his voice caught in his throat. At that moment, he heard the door behind him slowly open and felt cold breath on his neck. He turned slowly and saw a tall shadow standing by the door, reaching out toward him. He froze, unable to move or speak.

Then, suddenly, the screen went dark, and darkness returned. All he could hear was his own rapid breathing and the pounding of his heart. In that moment, Kyle **realized** he had entered a world unlike anything he had ever known a world of mystery and terror, where nothing was as it seemed, and where every answer opened the door to a new question.",1,1767207601.0,u_NeitherFig2490,0,1.0,False
1q0kna5,https://i.redd.it/ggyxt4ka7lag1.jpeg,"Spinn Pro—Brewer Stuck, Broken Strainer Pins, and Wiring Plug Confusion","We’ve used our Spinn coffee maker heavily for a few years, and aside from routine cleaning and experimenting with beans, it’s been reliable. About a month ago, while making a cold brew, I got the red ring error indicating the brewer was stuck. I did a thorough cleaning, but the issue persisted.

I called support; they said I could pay to ship it in for repair, but they currently don’t have a technician available and couldn’t provide a timeline. So I decided to open it up and try to fix it myself.

After about 45 minutes, I had the brewer assembly out. There’s a lot going on inside that unit. I took photos before disassembly to help with reassembly. Once I removed the brew strainer, I found the root cause: the small plastic pins that hold the strainer in place had snapped. That prevented the brew basket from engaging properly and from spinning.

I repaired the basket and put everything back together, but ran into another problem: there are at least three or four wires with interchangeable plugs, and my photos didn’t clearly show their original positions. I should have labeled them as I unplugged them, but I rushed because I needed to be somewhere. I reconnected them where I thought they belonged, but now I’m getting multiple errors on startup.

I’ve powered it down and plan to revisit the wiring, but I don’t want to cause further damage by guessing. It’s possible I’ve already connected something incorrectly and damaged a component.

**Question:** Does anyone have a wiring guide or know which plugs go where on the Spinn Pro? Photos, diagrams, or any guidance would be hugely appreciated—I’ve scoured the internet and haven’t found clear instructions or good reference images.

Favorite things about the interior of the unit?

•It’s a vintage-esque, cozy, charming and massive (750 sq ft) corner unit, right around the corner from an elevator and down the hall from trash chute, laundry and the gym. The alcove “L” shaped studio layout is super unique and allows for the “bedroom” to be hidden. Lots of space for artwork with 12.5ft ceilings, exposed beams and brick walls.

•This studio apartment is shockingly perfect for hosting because of the kitchen island and huge living space. Hangouts feel warm, inviting and comfortable. Plenty of space to get creative. I just recently DIY updated the countertops and backsplash to something a bit more fun.

•Double vanity in the bathroom with a giant wall to wall mirror. Best part is the ridiculous amount of closets and storage space. There’s a coat closet next to the front door, a linen closet with shelving in the “bedroom”, a large closet in the hallway, a double door closet in the bathroom, and a linen closet across the toilet.

•The east facing windows are perfect for most house plants. Plenty of direct light in the mornings and afternoons.

Best things about the building?

•The 24/7 doorman service is staffed by the sweetest, most accommodating people. Maintenance is typically on-site daily to address issues. Several private entrances that allow for a very peaceful and safe big city and large building experience.

Best things about the neighborhood?

•Everything is walkable and with Lincoln Park just up the road, the North Ave and Oak Street beaches are \~20 min walk.

•You have an Aldi and a Jewel Osco within a 5-7 walk. Tons of cafes, bars, restaurants, workout studios, and shops all around. Nothing better than being just steps from your apt after a night out!!

•Equidistant from ORD and MDW. Easy access to the highway.

TONS of options for public transit- closest train stations are the Division Red Line and Sedgwick Brown/Purple Line. The 36, 22, 156, 70, 72, and 37 busses are all within a 4-8 min walk.

What makes this place worthy of calling home?

•It’s central to almost every neighborhood. 15 mins on the bus to Wicker Park. 15 min walk to Lincoln park. 15 mins walk to River North. Your quality of life will significantly improve from how comfortable and convenient this apartment is.

background - 46 years old. Eczema for 44 years (my mom is adamant that it didn't start until I was a toddler). Topical and oral steroids for decades, suffered through TSW in 2014/2015, was eczema free until about 2 years ago. Then it popped up in small little ways, always manageable with non-steroid options. Until this year. THANKS, PERIMENOPAUSE! 

About 7 months ago, I started getting what I thought was nummular eczema on my neck, arms, shoulders, knees, shins, and ankles. Nowhere else. Round patches that would fade with Opzelura, but then would come back after a few days. My derm is awesome, but she was on maternity leave, so I finally relented and went to a new doctor in the same practice. She, too, was amazing. The minute she looked at my skin, she said ""I want to try something..."" and took the sharp end of a swab and drew an X on my back. Within seconds it was red and raised, and she diagnosed me with Dermographism and Mast Cell Activation. 

A lifetime of eczema, skin allergies and allergic reactions, and histamine overload has most likely been leading up to this. She gave me a very manageable plan, and I've been following it for a month with fantastic results. Definitely not completely back to normal, but I'm about 90% better. 

I was so worried that yet another doctor would take a look at me and say ""Oh, it's atopic dermatitis! Here's some prednisone! Sucks to be you!"" But she really understood what was wrong with me. 

Just sharing this story in case anyone else is going through it or has experienced similar! 

The plan she has me on: 

1) Take collagen daily (I mix the powder with my coffee) 

2) No more hand or body soap. I use cetaphil facial cleanser on my hands, and oil cleanser on my skin in the shower (Cerave oil to foam).

3) Ceramides - Cerave body cream all day every day 

4) Loratadine 10mg graduated plan (Started off with 2 in the AM and 2 in the PM for a week and worked my way down to 1 AM and 1 PM now)

5) Staph ointment in nostrils for 5 days in a row

I am so fucking tired of living here like this. I feel sick. I feel trapped. I feel unsafe in a place that’s supposed to be my home. Today was supposed to be normal. I had plans with my friends for New Year. 

I got dressed. I went out. I just wanted to see fireworks for once and feel normal... even for an hour. And even that was taken away from me. While I was out, this manager started roaming around our apartment like he owns us. Asking my roommate if I was inside. It was nit even 11pm yet. She told him I was in the room, covering up for me. 

He forced himself inside the apartment when she was alone and literally checked the room to see if I was there. We do not live in a hostel. This is an apartment. He has no legal right to enter, to check, to interrogate. He doesn’t even own this place. He’s just a manager whose job is to bring students here. That’s it. And yet he has keys. He comes whenever he wants. Day or night. No warning. No permission. Like our privacy means nothing.

Because of this exact behavior, one of my flatmates already left this apartment. And it gets worse. After she left, days later, he called her on her phone and asked her out for coffee. A man who is 35+. A man with kids. A man who had power over where she lived. When she confronted him and said she would record him and expose him, he blocked her and quietly changed privacy settings in our apartment group. That’s how he operates.

Our curfew is 11 pm. I was back before 11. Still, I panicked. I cried to my friends and begged them to drop me back early because I knew what would happen... calls, threats, him saying he’ll inform my family. He always uses family as a weapon. My friends were angry. Their plan got ruined. I felt like a burden. Like my fear ruined everyone’s night.

I couldn’t even enjoy fireworks because I was scared of coming back to my own room.
We can’t fight him openly. Because when girls speak up, he retaliates. He harasses. He threatens to kick us out, knowing very well that students can’t move out overnight. He specifically targets girls who resist. He knows exactly what he’s doing.
I am exhausted. I am mentally drained. 

I am constantly alert, constantly scared, constantly calculating my moves like I’m doing something wrong... when all I want is to live, study, and breathe in peace. This isn’t discipline. This isn’t concern. This is abuse of power. This is control. This is harassment. And I’m so fucking tired of pretending this is normal. 

And yes, I cannot move out just overnight. And he is so against me because I told him how frustrating his actions are and he decided to frustrate me even more now... ",2,1767207311.0,NUST,12,0.67,False

مش عارف اذا بدي احكي باختصار شديد ولا اغوص بالحكي, بس الوضع اللي عايش فيه حاليا كثير سيء الحمدلله على كل شيء   
ببساطة انا شب بدرس بالاردنية سنة ثانية, وصلت مرحلة مادية كان لازم مرات اغيب عن الجامعة عشان ما معي حق المواصلات حتى.  
كيف هيك وصل الوضع؟ الحمدلله على كل شيء, الدخل الوحيد بالبيت كان عبارة عن راتب تقاعد ابوي الله يرحمه وكفالات الايتام   
الحمدلله الاشي الوحيد اللي تركه كان المكرمة الملكية الحمدلله يارب اني انا واختي بندرس ببلاش غيرنا مو ملاقي هالنعمة.  
زمان لما كنت قاصر تحت الـ18 كنا عايشين حياة كلشي متوفر كان, على قد ما كانت بسيطة بس كنا عايشين يعني وامي كانت تحرم حالها من كلشي بس عشان تعطيني انا واختي (برضو بالاردنية) اي شي كنا نطلبه, ما عمرنا انحرمنا من اشي  
بس هسا لما كبرنا راحت اغلب الكفالات وما ضل غير راتب تقاعد ابوي, يعني انت بتحكي عن راتب حتى اقل من الحد الادنى, واحنا عايشين ببيت ايجار وبندفع كهرباء ومي وانترنت حرفيا ما بضل اشي من الراتب, غير انه مواصلاتي للجامعة ما يقارب ال4 ليرات واختي نفس الشي يعني بتحكي عن تقريبا 100 ليرة مواصلات بدون مصروف بدون اكل ولا شرب.  
الاشي الوحيد اللي قاتلني وبضل افكر فيه بالليل انه انا المفروض اصرف على اهلي, يخوان اقسم بالله مرات بحس عمري سبعين سنة من قد ما بفكر وانا حتى لسا ما صار عمري 20.  
  
im fluent in english and i've been looking for a job endlessly but i simply cant apply for anything that's on site, it has to be remote   
اتوقع واضح ليش لأنه ما معي مصاري اوصل الشركة   
 i tried applying for call centers and coffee shops but it just doesnt seem to work out  
i was a smoker for 6+ years sadly, but i managed to quit because i can't afford to smoke, and i've been clean for 4 months now alhamdulillah  
بدي تحكولي ايش فيه اشي بقدر اعمله, ما بدي اعيش حياة الرفاهية ولا اشي بس بدي اصرف على اهلي ما بدي امي تنجلط من التفكير.

Sweat lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my gaze on the newspaper, shielding my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.
 
“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin. I heard water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed up and down against my leg. 

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged 

Sipping my coffee, shakily, i adjusted the newspaper. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped, dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. 

You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved her with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the *real* her. Because the person sitting before me today…was *not* my wife. 

My wife was an angel. A shining light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind everything, the reason she put on her wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city; plummeting to a watery grave below. 

We argued. I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back. But I can’t. I’m stuck here with this, this… imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. 

I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, okay?! I’m sorry. I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, she *has* to know, right? 

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,” 

I was at my breaking point. Tears were stinging my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the sports section. She ran her hand across the top, back and forth, and the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view. 

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms. 

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails.

She’s still wearing her wedding dress. The silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I love my wife. I miss her. Lord, forgive me for what I’ve done.

I've got money saved up to love out this summer. I work from home remotely. I don't have a car because my mom didn't let me enroll in driving school as a kid and she's always been very poor. My mom got divorced a couple months before I was born. I am 25 years old.

I lived through a very upsetting and traumatic evening in 2023 at Michigan State University. I've done a lot of work to mentally heal from it. While I was in my dorm the whole time, it was an extremely upsetting day, and definitely the worst day of my life. Some of my friends were injured and some of my friend's friends were one of the ones directly impacted by it. My mom had secondary trauma most likely from being on the phone with me and hearing some of my experiences. In an attempt to have my mind understand that what has happened was actually real, I went out to the location two days after to put flowers on the building. I walked around the building to the door that I used to frequent nearly every day multiple times. When I turned to leave, I almost stepped in vomit from the day of the shooting.

I asked my mom if it was ok if she could drive me to the gym on Friday. I wanted to make sure I asked far enough in advance to encourage good communication. She also works from home and she said that the fact I brought it up made her have so much anxiety and mental turmoil, she felt like I had thrown a bomb in her day. She also has a lot of anxiety around driving so she said that it was unfair of me to bring up something so triggering while she has to work. I said I understood and if she wanted I'd talk about it the day of. She still is talking about it in a frenzied and shriekish voice. I was quiet and trying to ignore her. She's quiet for a minute and then she says ""It's equivalent to someone brining up your PTSD in a moment you don't expect and then you're left with all the bad feelings and emotions."" I gave a small chuckle, and I paused while pouring my coffee. ""Oh, like now I guess."" I said in a somewhat snarky voice. I didn't want to be mean. But when she said that I thought, how could you be so cruel to your child. She got silent and then started talking about the news.

Furthermore, this character has a very detailed design for a mere background character in a flashback, which made me wonder, ""Why would a background character have such an elaborate design just for a flashback?"".
The theory starts to make more sense when we observe Semiu fighting a group that tried to invade the cleaner's HQ to kidnap Rudo. In that scene, she demonstrates a high level of combat ability for a cleaner who doesn't possess a combat jinki, but a tactical one. This suggests she at least has a past in which she developed significant combat mastery. She is 26 years old, Mildretta is 24, and Noerde is 22, a difference of about four years between them.

The more independent I got... I started to see things. I decided to go NC after she broke my mental health boundaries...

I'm not sure where I should start because I don't think my mom was always abusive. My childhood I would say was okay, there were moments where my mom put a lot of house responsibilities on me when I was 11yo. Making coffee, cooking and cleaning as she was saying she's tired. 

Things started to get a bad turn when my dad started to work abroad. From that point she started to physically and mentally abuse me when she was upset. She blamed me for mess around the house, my grades could be better and causing too much trouble. That was also the time she started to say 'I had to drop uni and career because I decided to have you'.

I was afraid to go against her as I never could figure out what she would do to me. From that point I got quiet and didn't want any proof of my existence (no pictures, no social media under my real name etc.)

Years passed and as I grew up she started putting more stuff on me. From house responsibilities to taking care of my younger siblings. Then she decided to start her own business of breeding cats and making clothes for them. I was at uni during that time and basically she asked me to help with business. I designed a logo for her, business cards etc. When she decided to go on holiday she started to say I need to work for her business as her reputation is important. Once I was working until 3am as I had assignments and in the meantime packed her orders, I made a small mistake and packed the order wrong which I found out later.

She called me when I was celebrating my birthday with my boyfriend (she was still on a holiday) and accused me of sabotaging her whole business and I'm a failure of a daughter... More time passed and once I started work she started to borrow money from me for a ninja ice cream maker, grill, and other stuff she said is necessary for her to function and dad wouldn't allow her to buy it.

I'm getting married in a few months. She hates my fiancé and says he's taking me away from family and breaking out bonds. I don't think we ever had one? She treated me more as a vent bag as she said all her friends are stupid and annoying, stopped going out of the house because she was tired etc. 

It all changed when my fiancé decided to text her to be more respectful towards me which she decided to do a drama toward me sending my dog at her. Something snapped inside and I told her I needed distance because she hurt me deeply. I don't think she understood because she called me egoistic and that her emotions don't matter to me.

It's been 2 months now and I feel relieved and somehow like some weight lifted from my chest. I'm not sad nor happy, just empty and free. Other family members tried to tell me I need to fix it as mother and daughter need to have a relationship and they believe my fiancé is controlling me or she had to go on antidepressants because I hurt her and now punish with no contact.

I don't think I want to? I've been reading and watching a lot of materials about narcissistic mothers and I think she fits the criteria but I'm afraid of being wrong. ",4,1767206744.0,raisedbynarcissists,4,0.84,False

1q0kalp,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0kalp,The Twelve Houses of Gondolin,"I have always wanted to see an artist really go after the 12 Houses of Gondolin. I have zero artistic ability but a lot of ideas. I tried using Gemini Nano Bana 3 - Thinking to create the Twelve Houses of Gondolin. I only provided prompts, and in one case uploaded some images for inspiration. 

Here are short summaries of the gist of my thoughts for the Houses. The prompts were for banner sigil, shield, troop appearance, captain appearance, and lord of the house appearance.

House of the King - This was the hardest. Obviously use of the sun, moon and heart. AI could not handle making a sigil with all 3 enclosed into one, i.e. layered on top each other. I tried so many times, and I also tried to get  AI to make a prompt. It just messes it up every time. I also wanted to use the image of a crown more as a symbol of the house. AI struggled to put appropriately sized crowns according to rank, but I thought that would be a cool component since the name is actually the House of the King. 

House of the Harp - I actually like how this came out. Between the Mole and the Harp, it seemed like a lot of black. I also wanted the Harp to be actually composed of ""good guys."" I actually think this is one of the better AI renders. Salgant does not look dumpy since it conflicts with Elven aesthetics later in the writings, but he still looks a little silly. I tried to downplay the black and use it more for contrast. Oh and there are tassels....

House of the Tree - I toyed with the idea of making lower ranks green and higher ranks brown, since usually it is the opposite. I also wanted the seemingly simple clubs to be richly carved and ornate - not just the leg of a coffee table. Mirkwood with money but less full of itself. It came out okay. Notice how AI changes the background sometimes. 

House of the Fountain - AI had trouble with this. The diamonds and flutes seemed to blow its mind. Themes were obviously diamonds and platinum. It's okay.

House of the Golden Flower - I wanted a lot of gold, despite the green field described. I always picture this House next to the House of the Foutain, so I wanted that contrast. Having said that, I tried to add green. Yes, that is Asfaloth with bells. That horse is old AF. 

House of the Mole - The black banner always seemed so dull and on the nose. I kept the banner black but tried to use a matte finish for everything. I also wanted more black fur incorporated. Since the mining thing is a big deal, I wanted the shields to have almost a shovel edge to the bottom. AI could not handle this. I did purposely want Maeglin's black to contrast. He is his own team with the rest of them as pawns. It is metallic and slim. Galvorn?

House of the Swallow - This one was fun. AI had good ideas but could never piece them all together. It often would change random stuff when I would specifically ask it to change one thing. It is so dumb sometimes. I no longer worry about AI world domination. Duilin is only one with some white, captain has more black and left the blue and purple for the troops. I wanted the forked tail to be the arrow head but AI struggled so I gave up.

Houses of the Pillar and Tower of Snow - I did end up having fun with this one as well. I tried to have Penlod incorporate colors of both houses, while keeping them very distinct. I also had the idea to make him more distinct from both. 

House of the Heavenly Arch - So when you try to use rainbows, AI gets pretty stupid. In the end, I went with a Triumphal Arch, utilizing the gemstones for the rainbow effect. Still, AI struggled. 

House of the Wing - Such an important house given its future relevance. Most of the time AI wanted to create Thor. This is the one I did upload Rings of Power shield and axe (one of the few things the show did well - Weta). The AI wanted to put long swan necks on everything which got old. I tried to have Tuor use swan and gull images but it was a struggle.

House of the Hammer of Wrath - This has always been my favorite House. I don't know about you, but I often read the colors as red, gold, and black iron. It actually says red gold and black iron. Tolkien's usual genius signs. The red-gold really makes it look like heated metal. It also gives it a unique color combo since red-gold, ie darker rose gold, is not used much. 

Special note on Rog. Obviously the name is a problem. We all know it, but we all want to make it work somehow. I went with the idea of him  purposefully getting them name for his artistic choices, despite the stigma. I wanted it to be more of the Dragonhelm idea vs his real name is demon. My thought was to make the name come from the ""magical"" way he wrought the iron to make it look like smoldering coal. I thought that such a unique trait would be a reasonable way for him to get the nickname. 

Finely, I tried all the prompts in a single document to create the armies separate from each other but in one image. There is the results. Oh, Ai.....

P.S. I wrote a lot, and I really don't feel like proof reading. Sorry.

If you want to start at the start, we'll mass up at **Dear Diary Coffee** for a **10am wheels down**. 

**You can join this ride at any point.** Just call ‪the RADD Hotline (512-766-8255)‬ to hear the most recent location update in the voicemail. We'll always tell you where we're headed next, and what time we think we'll get there. You can call or text that same number to let Litsa know you're on your way.

This ride is a **ramble**, meaning we will be exploring every type of terrain in the city limits. Any bike with **fattish tires** is perfect. We're not in a hurry, so if you need to walk some parts, that's totally cool.

Also, in the tradition of RADD, there is no route. **The point is ADVENTURE!** We do what we want! We'll probably stop for lunch somewhere, and maybe get drinks after. 

See you there!!!

1q0k44w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0k44w,Here's my Tanzanite Blue G83 I got back in March (and my previous M440i which led me to here),"I traded my 2021 M440i for $36k for an M4 X-Drive Comp ($64.9k) in March 2025. I live in Chicago but went with a convertible, since I've never had one before, and a good 6 months you can keep the top down. The first time I lowered the top and heard the engine, I realized I had made the right choice.

What I've loved:

* The aggressive but polarizing frontend makes this car more of a statement piece on the road and since I love the design, I stand by it proudly
* The paint is beautiful when the sun hits it right. It's mature and subtle on a cloudy day, and luxurious and vibrant on a sunny day
* The steering input and handling feels much tighter and alive
* Dropping the top and driving along the lakeside in Chicago feels like I'm in a movie. Worth the trade off for the differences in side profile.
* Compliments come at me randomly all the time everywhere from kids to grandpas

What I miss about the M440i:

* The lack of brake dust was nice. I am replacing my brake pads with iSWEEP's to fix this
* Silver wheels were prettier in my opinion and less of a PITA
* Engine sound, in my opinion, was throatier. Turbo spooled up faster off the line
* Cabin noise was a bit more dampened (coupe vs convertible, plus Competition skimps on some materials for weight savings)
* Auto-extending seat belt arms to make reaching them easier
* Alpine White was such a fresh color, and hid scratches better. The Tanzanite blue is very soft paint and any swirl / mark stands out

and of course, problems:

* A/C pump was faulty and had to be replaced (warranty covered)
* Previous owner had spilled coffee on the iDrive assembly and broke the neck heater switches (dealership replaced switchers at cost, and I removed assembly and cleaned with 99% isopropyl to get rid of stickiness on iDrive buttons)
* Rattling issues galore, so far all covered by manufacturer warranty
   * Front left door rattle
   * Back right convertible mechanism rattle
   * Front left window is now rattling (will have to check with dealership)

1q0k1wb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wican/comments/1q0k1wb/mercedes_eqv_with_wican_pro/,Mercedes EQV with WiCAN Pro,"Hi there,

I’d like to share some experiences with my WiCAN Pro. I received it in May and like it a lot. I learned about it while searching for a device that could integrate my vehicle into Home Assistant.

I have a Mercedes EQV, an electric van, which I step by step convert to a (smart) camper. This is my summary of what I learned over the past months.

I hope it will help and inspire other users to make great use of the WiCAN. 

**Camper setup (for who is curious)**  
The EQV, has a 100kWh high voltage battery. Only 90kWh is usable. A DC-DC converter charges the 12volt car battery (+-1kWh)  in the EQV while charging and driving. That’s the Mercedes part. For camping, i’d like an extra battery with large inverter to AC, for cooking, cooling and of course coffee☕️The Ecoflow Delta Max 2 (2kWh). The Ecoflow Alternator charger (800W), charges the Ecoflow battery from the 12 volt system. 

The Ecoflow has also USB outputs, which I use to power an Raspberri Pi 5 with Home Assistant running. 

**Home Assistant**  
HA is great. I use it to monitor and control my car via de Mercedes app integration ([https://github.com/ReneNulschDE/mbapi2020](https://github.com/ReneNulschDE/mbapi2020)), use Zigbee sensors, weather information, public chargers info, music: a complete camper dashboard UI :) For remote accessibility and Wi-Fi setup, I use the Teltonika RUTX50. An 5g Router with dual sim, e-sim, GPS, VPN, MQTT. So there is 24/7 Wi-Fi available in the van, with an UTP to the RP5. Both the RP5 and 5g modem uses 9-12 watt in total. But, not everywhere the 5g signal is great. So I want everything to be as local as possible. That’s where the WiCAN Pro comes in. 

**WiCAN Pro**  
My first great introduction to the WiCAN was via the great YouTube channel *Smarty Van*. They made an excellent video about the WiCAN: [https://youtu.be/hx8UjOLD1tw](https://youtu.be/hx8UjOLD1tw)

This really got me excited to make a smart car infotainment dashboard that is better than the Mercedes one haha. There is a WiCAN integration available for Home Assistant. With just a few steps you can integrate your WiCAN to your dashboard. The 24/7 WiFi in my vehicle makes it very easy to add it. (But i hope other users will share their setups, like BLE, hotspot, VPN). 

I also wanted the vehicle speed in my dashboard, so I don’t only use the integration for data, because that is (for now) limited to max 1second interval. For faster speeds I use MQTT. Smarty Van also explains that very well! But, which data is there? There are, in simple terms, two ways for data access from your car: Reading the CANbus, or sending an (OBD) PID request:

**PID requests**  
Almost every car has an OBD2 port where the WiCAN connects. And for non-electric cars there is a standard set of PID requests. You can find the list on Wikipedia. It is standard because car makers have to include it in their cars for fuel consumption tests. That data all goes via the OBD pin in the OBD2 port. You also find OBD data for maintenance, check lights.. Since electric cars don’t have fuel consumption, they are not required to support the full standard PID list.

Car makers make their own list, which is not publicly available. But, with a great community, a lot of PIDs for a lot of vehicles are found. On the WiCAN documentation you find a list of cars. That list is growing every month. Sadly, for my Mercedes, it is hard. In the last couple of months I found some. But I still have to test. In the meantime, I found another way to use car data:

**CANbus**  
Most cars use a CAN network to let important devices talk to each other. It is a broadcast network: every device talks over the bus, and other devices listen to the important information. Reading the CANbus is a great source of car data. Unfortunately, not every car manufacturer makes the CAN network accessible via the OBD2 port of the car. But happy to find out that my EQV does. It was time to reverse engineer some data! It sounds hard, but with no experience in this, I managed to get it working quite easily. So you can too! A great tool for that is SavvyCAN:

**SavvyCAN**  
Free to download, open source and very easy when you understand the basics. I can’t program and have limited knowledge about hexadecimal/binary. But I did learn everything by a great YouTube vids:

[https://youtu.be/vNoTxVML6y8](https://youtu.be/vNoTxVML6y8) (part 1)  
[https://youtu.be/WBIOKLcOhpE](https://youtu.be/WBIOKLcOhpE) (part 2)  
[https://youtu.be/4gx\_gLhNjvs](https://youtu.be/4gx_gLhNjvs)  
[https://youtu.be/RkbqX16N1so](https://youtu.be/RkbqX16N1so) (min 19:01)

They are long videos, but it will guide you step by step throughout the process. A really simple summary:

Connect your WiCAN to AP of Station mode. Set protocol to SavvyCAN. Connect SavvyCAN via your IP to the WiCAN. Start your car and see the CAN data float :) Use the sniffer tool to play with live data. Like opening a door and seeing which CAN ID and byte changes. It’s really fun to do! 

And of course, I let ChatGPT search in my logs. It did find a lot of CAN IDs. Also there are a lot of IDs online. You can search for DBC files, that are files describing which CAN ID means what.

**Dashboard**

Some screens

Already some great automations with the WiCAN CAN data:

* When the RP5 loses my phones BLE signal, and the car is still unlocked, send a message
* When the car alarm goes off, send a critical message to my phone and add a screenshot of my dashcam (with wi-fi). 

**Future**  
For me, this is just the starting point. I’d like to discover a lot more car data and fully integrate that in my Home Assistant dashboard. And maybe, discover some ways to control the car (always safely). 

Some great sources to read:  
[https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/obd2-explained-simple-intro](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/obd2-explained-simple-intro)  
[https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-simple-intro-tutorial](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/can-bus-simple-intro-tutorial)

I know this is a bit of an unusual setup, with Home Assistant running in a car. But with hotspot+VPN tunnel, you can get the data in your Home Assistant too. So share your configs too! It will help others.

A big thanks to the WiCAN developer Ali. He helped a lot and really wants to build a big community around this. Ali, you are great!! :D

If you have any questions or ideas: share them! :)

Happy new year 🎇

There are so many outfits, themes and legendary Dwellers now, it would be nice to be able to use it all.

The Vault is 25 Floors deep. Most Floors (apart from top floor, the floor with the overseers office and the barbershop) could be staffed with 16 Dwellers. Which would total to about 390 Dwellers to occupy every spot + 6 (or 9) for Quests + 25 Explorers + however many you like to have wandering around on Coffee Break. 200 seems a bit low to me if one could easily fit double that into an endgame Vault.

Todays phones should also have no issue with it in case the limit was performance related when the game was released 10 years ago. We also had no themes, no Quests, no workshops, only 20 legendary Dwellers and therefore a lot less outfits back then.

I tried all different combinations of temperature/strength settings, and many different grind settings ranging from 8 to 20. We are going to try medium roast next, but I would have to imagine I’m doing something immensely wrong for any/every setting to yield an incredibly sour espresso. 

Any and all suggestions are welcome, because I am at a loss and have wasted way too many beans trying to dial this in. The beans are Gaia coffee co, roasted 12/17.

Edit: the pH of the espresso is reading 4.6… I can’t imagine that is normal",3,1767205954.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,4,1.0,False
1q0jz4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/IslamabadSocial/comments/1q0jz4o/i_am_so_fucking_tired_of_this_man/,I am so fucking tired of this man,"I am so fucking tired of living like this. I feel sick. I feel trapped. I feel unsafe in a place that’s supposed to be my home.

Today was supposed to be normal. I had plans with my friends for New Year. I got dressed. I went out. I just wanted to see fireworks for once and feel normal... even for an hour. And even that was taken away from me.

While I was out, this manager started roaming around our apartment like he owns us. Asking my roommate if I was inside. It was not even 11pm yet. She told him I was in the room, covering up for me. He forced himself inside the apartment when she was alone and literally checked the room to see if I was there. 

We do not live in a hostel. This is an apartment. He has no legal right to enter, to check, to interrogate.
He doesn’t even own this place. He’s just a manager whose job is to bring students here. That’s it. And yet he has keys. He comes whenever he wants. Day or night. No warning. No permission. Like our privacy means nothing.

Because of this exact behavior, one of my flatmates already left this apartment. And it gets worse. After she left, days later, he called her on her phone and asked her out for coffee. A man who is 35+. A man with kids. A man who had power over where she lived. 

When she confronted him and said she would record him and expose him, he blocked her and quietly changed privacy settings in our apartment group. That’s how he operates.

Our curfew is 11 pm. I was back before 11. Still, I panicked. I cried to my friends and begged them to drop me back early because I knew what would happen... calls, threats, him saying he’ll inform my family. He always uses family as a weapon. My friends were angry. Their plan got ruined. I felt like a burden. Like my fear ruined everyone’s night.

I couldn’t even enjoy fireworks because I was scared of coming back to my own room.
We can’t fight him openly. Because when girls speak up, he retaliates. He harasses. He threatens to kick us out, knowing very well that students can’t move out overnight. He specifically targets girls who resist. He knows exactly what he’s doing
.
I am exhausted. I am mentally drained. I am constantly alert, constantly scared, constantly calculating my moves like I’m doing something wrong... when all I want is to live, study, and breathe in peace. This isn’t discipline. This isn’t concern. This is abuse of power. This is control. This is harassment.

And I’m so fucking tired of pretending this is normal. And I cannot even move out to some other place... ",0,1767205875.0,IslamabadSocial,37,0.5,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1q0jw3d,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/dec/31/eu-legislation-intended-to-fight-deforestation-has-been-effectively-dismantled,EU legislation intended to fight deforestation has been effectively ‘dismantled’,"###Law’s original author points to removal of obligations for downstream traders to verify origin of commodities

It was hailed by campaigners around the world as a game-changing piece of legislation that would help stop deforestation.

But when a bullet-ridden version of the EU’s deforestation regulation, once supposed to be the crown of the Green Deal, finally limped across the legislative line this month, not even its architect was smiling, and one politician said it had been pretty much “dismantled”.

Hugo Schally, the law’s original author who has since retired from the [European Commission](https://www.theguardian.com/world/european-commission), told the Guardian he believed it had been “hollowed out” by the removal of obligations on downstream traders to verify the origin of commodities such as palm oil, soy, wood, beef, rubber, cocoa and coffee.

“There now will be fewer actors with direct obligations, fewer data points along the value chain and less precise origin data, which will make enforcement and eventual prosecution more difficult,” he said.

The Green party’s vice-president in the European Parliament, Marie Toussaint, went further, saying that delays, loopholes and an added exemption for printed products – an [apparent sop](https://www.ft.com/content/8f035c12-50dc-4f43-a9d0-8d05a6121089) to [appease President Donald Trump](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1225115349519943) – amounted to the “political dismantling” of the law. She called on the commission to withdraw the proposal.

It is a far cry from the hopes of the 1.2 million EU citizens who signed the [petition](https://www.greenpeace.org/eu-unit/issues/nature-food/45406/over-1-million-people-tell-eu-to-stop-funding-forest-destruction/#:~:text=Brussels%20%E2%80%93%20A%20landmark%201%2C193%2C652%20people,to%20protect%20the%20world's%20forests.%E2%80%9D) kickstarting the process to ban deforestation-linked products from Europe’s market in 2020. Launching the proposal in 2021, the EU’s then-Green Deal commissioner, Frans Timmermans, [trumpeted](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_6085) it as “the most ambitious … ever put forward” to combat forest loss.

Four hundred and 20 million hectares of forest – an area larger than the EU itself – have disappeared since 1990, in part thanks to Europe’s consumption patterns. Timmermans said that the draft law showed “our willingness to walk our ‘green talks’ globally”.

But critics say that the proposal’s unravelling shows the EU’s willingness to walk back the green talk. The law was twice [delayed](https://www.clientearth.org/latest/press-office/lawyers-roll-their-eyes-as-eu-commission-blames-it-issues-for-another-deforestation-regulation-delay/), for 12 months each time, over IT issues.

In its original form, the law required companies to monitor their third-party contractors and trace the origin of commodities destined for Europe back to their original plot of land, using geolocation data.

However, the due diligence involved triggered a Brussels backlash with [multinationals](https://coffeewatch.org/get-deforestation-out-of-europes-coffee/), [producer countries](https://www.ft.com/content/678f7c25-2eff-4e98-9c7c-e0772fa69236?syn-25a6b1a6=1), [rightwing parties](https://www.eppgroup.eu/newsroom/epp-delivers-flawed-deforestation-regulation-to-be-delayed) and [EU logging states](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/eleven-countries-demand-eu-weakens-deforestation-law-further-document-shows-2025-05-26/) all brandishing axes. Last year’s EU elections were pinpointed as a “a decisive moment because there is now a different majority \[in parliament\]” by Andreas Rasche, a corporate sustainability professor and associate dean at the Copenhagen Business School. “The conservatives of the European Peoples party (EPP) are [building an alliance with far-right parties](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/16/green-groups-eu-betrayal-vote-reduce-oversight-firms) \[which\] hate the Green Deal and want some of these regulations gone altogether.” It was this alliance that passed the legislation in the European parliament.",1,1767205664.0,europes,0,1.0,False

My ex is, without a doubt, the best person I have ever met in my life. We met in high school, and instantly I felt this connection I haven’t felt with anyone before or after. Not only were we into the same movies and shows, but she was so kind, her smile is still the most beautiful thing I ever laid eyes on. I started texting her once, and pretty much every day we would talk for hours on end. Eventually, I asked her out, and she said yes. Going on dates with her was somehow both the most terrifying and the most happy moment of my life. I can confidently say we were great together.

However, I had my ideas for a relationship, and she had hers. I wanted to do everything with her; go out for coffee, watch movies together, invite her over and then do everything couples usually do. But she had strict parents, and they wouldn’t let her go out as much as she wanted. That itself wasn’t really the issue though, the issue was that she was too accepting of it. She would say “It is what it is”, and she was more than happy just texting. Just texting isn’t what I had in mind for a relationship. I started feeling as though she didn’t really love me, she just wanted to say she had a boyfriend so she kept me around. There was also the issue of us going our seperate ways for college, and even though we would be just 2 hours apart, I felt as though that was a dealbreaker. So after a few months of hoping things would change, I broke up with her with a heavy heart. 

I regretted that decision pretty much immediately, and I even tried to ask her to be with me again, but by that point the damage was done. At times, we would still each other about upcoming movies and about school stuff, but us as a thing was over.

College rolled around, and I had trouble making friends, both due to my innate awkwardness, and also still reeling from the breakup. A few years in, I got myself a student job as a cashier. At both college and work, I’ve had a few other crushes, but none of them were even close to her. I still kept in touch with her from time to time, and by this point my feelings for her had faded a bit, but still I felt a rush of excitement every time I got a response. 

One day, I texted her something on Messenger, but she didn’t respond. I thought this was her severing all ties with me, and I couldn’t blame her. She did text me back eventually, apologising and saying her Facebook logged her out for some reason and she didn’t even use it much anyways anymore so she didn’t see my message, but that did little to console me. It didn’t help that she sent the message the same day that our high school group chat started talking about a reunion. My theory was, she wanted to ignore me, but when she got the group text messages she figured she would text me back in order to not make it seem like she just ghosted me. I didn’t believe she would just ghost someone like that, but it certainly felt that way. I haven’t heard from her since… for a year.

This year, our high school class started planning for a 5 year reunion, and I decided to go just like last year. But unlike last year, she would be joining us too. Now, at this point, I didn’t think about her much, only on occasion. But I figured well, who knows? Might be interesting. It’s either going to be super awkward, or we would chat just as friends and nothing more. As the reunion got closer and closer, I started thinking more and more about what I would say to her. I even warned myself not to catch any feelings for her back, you don’t want to be that guy, I told myself.

I got to the reunion a bit early, and she was already there with her two friends. And she greeted me with her usual bright smile, like nothing even happened. We chatted for a bit before the others joined, after which we only exchanged a few more phrases, and she decided to leave. I left soon after, not seeing the point in sticking around anymore, and I felt disappointed. We only chatted briefly, but that was the best part of the night. Even now, we got along. I wanted to talk to her some more. 

I went back to my life, thinking I would move on like I did before. And yet I couldn’t. I started dreaming about her, and with each passing day the desire to text her grew stronger. I waited for a month before deciding to do it, under the guise of getting an opinion on a script I’m writing. I said to myself that I’m only texting her as a friend.

She replied back in 15 minutes, saying she was free. I told her I wanted an opinion on a script of mine, but I also added I wanted to catch up since we haven’t talked much during the reunion. We ended up texting for two hours that day, before I had to go to work. She agreed to read my script, and we would hear from each other in a week.

We ended up texting each other once a week since for about a month and a half, and I started thinking more and more about her. I could barely wait for my shift to be over just so I could text her. It got to the point where I couldn’t wait a week, so I texted her three days after our last message, talking about a show she recommended me. By the end of our talk, she asked me if we could text each other tomorrow. 

I was ecstatic. This was just last week, on Christmas Eve. On Christmas day, we ended up talking for nearly six hours straight. And the day after, another six hours. So I decided on a plan; I would return back to my hometown for New Year’s, and I would ask her to join me for a coffee. Not a date, just a simple night out. She agreed.

We met up two days ago. She greeted me with one of her smiles. I was so nervous, I could barely look her in the eyes at first. Still, we ended sitting at that coffee place for four hours. Walking back to my car, I thought about saying something, but decided against it, leaving the night there. I figured I would ask her out again. So yesterday I did, and she said her family would get together, so she wasn’t completely sure if we could go out. She also mentioned she doesn’t want to go out every single day. 

I stayed optimistic however, believing she wouldn’t text me for six hours and then drink coffee with me for four hours if it didn’t mean something to her. But today, she texted me saying she won’t make it, because her family would be staying longer than expected. And when I asked about tomorrow, she said she couldn’t make it then either. 

I was crushed. Of course, she can’t just bail on her family, especially not on holidays. Maybe I just wasn’t realistic enough, maybe I was too eager and too pushy, but her “refusal” honestly made me cry. I don’t even know what to do now. But I can’t keep these feelings inside of me. 

I was thinking about telling her I still love her tomorrow. Not begging her to be with me, not trying to make her feel guilty of something, just telling her I thought I moved on, but I didn’t. And I would try to figure it out with her what to do now; if she doesn’t like me back, would we keep texting each other? Would it be a better idea if she just blocked me for good? On one hand, if she blocked me, I would be forced to move on, which I probably should. On the other, she is the best person I have ever met, and the only person I can truly open up to. I don’t want to lose that. 

What do you guys think? Am I being too immature? Am I pretty much just stalking her at this point? Is it valid to have these feelings or should I just grow up? Is there a chance she could still like me back? And if she doesn’t, should I cut all contact with her to spare both myself and her? ",1,1767205547.0,infp,11,0.67,False
1q0jtxb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q0jtxb,my small business,"Hello everyone!!
Since I’m posting here for the first time, a little introduction about myself.

I’m Tayyibah, a 23 year old student who is going to start her last semester in college, and after a few months I’ll be in corporate. I have always wanted to do something of my own, even if it’s something small, and since I love baking, I really want to start with selling baked goodies. I bake a lot of things, but for now I’m only starting with:

1. Oats choco chip cookies
2. Cheesecake (not the usual one, the one I make is a bit different) but really, really yum.

I’ve got 2 orders till now, but it’s hard getting customers, which is why I thought of posting here.

I live in Ulwe, and I can take orders from anywhere in Navi Mumbai (Seawoods, Belapur, Kharghar, Panvel, etc.).

I’m also attaching pictures of the sweets. The presentation isn’t the best, but trust me, they taste really good 🙈.

If you would like to order, you can DM me on Instagram — my account is tayyibahqazii.
Or you can comment here as well, and I’ll reach out.

I haven’t created a separate business account because this is not something I’m planning to do for a long time. I just have time right now since I’m only studying, but once I start working in a few months, I won’t be able to take orders, which is why I don’t want to bother creating a new page 😶‍🌫️.

Also, if anyone has any ideas on how I can promote my business apart from Instagram, feel free to share <3

The oats choco chip cookies are healthy and a good quick breakfast or snack option, plus they taste great too.

and about the cheesecake unlike the usual heavy cheesecakes, mine is light, creamy, perfectly sweet and topped with a caramel coffee layer.

1q0jtm9,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1q0jtm9/just_another_summer_in_95/,Just Another Summer In ‘95,"I want to say this happened in the early summer when our park was full of hikers, campers, and tourists. Montana had its beauty in those summer months, so I couldn’t blame them.

A lot of the tourists hadn’t spent a day camping or even been backpacking. A lot of them hopped out of their cars to take close-up pictures of bison, so you can imagine we had a fair share of people getting lost. Hell, most of the time when I was on tower duty for the summer, I had to guide lost hikers back to the trail instead of watching for wildfires.

I always pictured being a park ranger as a relaxing job, and that was the case in ’94, before everything happened. We didn’t think much of it at first. There seemed to be more cases of rabies, more wildlife we had to put down, which had us carrying our .38 with us whenever we went out, putting more rifles in our trucks. I used to complain about having that heavy wheel gun hanging from my hip. It was heavy and got in the way of a pack and made my hips chafe sometimes. I wasn’t really used to carrying around a gun; I had only shot one maybe a few times. I stopped complaining after what happened in June.

Then we had the first incident at the start of the tour season. I was lying in my cot at the station, fast asleep, when the phone rang. I grumbled as I sat up and grabbed the phone.

“Hello?” I asked in a groggy voice.

I recognized my supervisor’s voice on the other end of the line.

“Hey Ash, we got a call at one of the campgrounds—some kind of disturbance going on there.”

I brushed my bangs out of my face as I held the phone in the crook of my neck.

“What kind of disturbance?” I asked, furrowing my brow slightly.

I heard my supervisor sigh through the slight static.

“Some people making a huge ruckus after quiet hours. Sounded like some rowdy kids blaring Nirvana.”

I yawned and quickly covered my mouth with my free hand.

“Who else is going down there?” I asked as I kicked the blankets off my body.

“Hmm. I have Felix on the way over, so I just need you to go with him. They’re probably drunk, so don’t get yourself hurt.”

I chuckled softly and tapped my foot on the edge of the cot.

“All I’m gonna do is tell them to turn down the music in my fancy uniform, Jake.”

He snorted softly at this. “Yeah, sure, killer. Sorry about waking you up for this, but a lot of the overnighters are tied up on tower duty. The other seasonals haven’t really started pouring in yet.”

I let out a sigh. “Same old story then. I’ll call you after I deal with it. Won’t take long. You have a good night, right? Tell Lauren I said hi.”

“Thanks, Ash, you have a good night too.”

I hung up the phone and made my way to my locker. It didn’t take me long to change into my uniform. I slipped on my jacket and grabbed my duty belt. I left that stupid wide-brimmed hat and just opted to wear the baseball-cap version I brought last summer.

The station was pretty quiet this time, and I made sure to grab a jolt from the fridge before I headed out. I had a feeling tonight would be a long night of paperwork—probably would need a second one before dawn, knowing me. Not to mention the coffee at the station tasted like dirt.

I passed Mel at the front desk, wearing a Walkman, probably listening to whatever they constantly blared on MTV while flipping through the glossy pages of the newest issue of Seventeen. She looked at me and gave me a wave as I returned it on my way out the door.

The lot was pretty deserted compared to how it gets later in the season. There were only two patrol trucks, mine and Mel’s; besides everyone’s personal cars, of course. Jake really wasn’t kidding about being short-staffed.

There was no wind that night—I remember that distinctly more than anything else. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. The moon hung low in the pitch-black night. The only sound I could hear in that quiet parking lot was a great-horned owl hooting in the distant treeline, as well as my set of keys jingling on my belt as I walked to my truck.

I cracked open the can of Jolt as I put my keys in the ignition and let my truck rumble to life. I pulled out of the lot onto the gravel road and began to drive. I turned on my radio and tuned into the nearest station; one of those late-night stations with a barely-awake DJ mumbling out song names. This happened to be playing eighties pop—could be worse, I suppose.

My headlights were my only source of light on those winding back-country roads. I was glad to be used to traversing the rough roads here. It wasn’t long before I reached the campgrounds. Despite being early in the season, the campgrounds were still pretty packed.

I pulled through the checkpoint, passing the worn-out volunteer stuck on gate duty. There weren’t many lights on at this time of night; the only lighting I could make out from the hazy windows of my truck was from the sparsely placed streetlights and the dim orange glow from dying campfires. I turned around a small bend in the road to see at least four cars crammed into a parking space meant for three. Several tents were set up in random spots around the campsite. Most of them didn’t even look like they were staked in properly.

Even from the road I could hear the music blaring from some boombox they had near the still-burning campfire. What already stuck out to me was that there wasn’t anyone out and about. Sure, it was late, but the fire was still going pretty strong. Someone had fed it within an hour or two. Had they just been so drunk they passed out in their tents?

There wasn’t long to debate what could have happened when I saw a pair of headlights approaching in my rearview mirror. I quickly recognized it to be one of our trucks. I put my own truck in park and killed the engine. I stepped out and gave a wave to Felix’s truck as I heard the sound of a car door opening and closing. I heard a softer-spoken voice.

“I thought you were gonna get some sleep tonight?”

I shrugged as I saw the tall form of Felix saunter into view in his faded uniform. “So did I, but here I am.”

“Jake’s doing, I’m guessing?” he asked as he rubbed his unshaven chin.

I sighed and nodded my head, and Felix gave me a sympathetic smile as he motioned for me to follow him. We both took out our flashlights and began to walk toward the campsite.

“I wouldn’t worry about it, Ashley. It’s only your second summer here after all.”

I nodded in agreement as I boot crunched a pine cone in half. “I know, but it feels like I’m left holding the bag sometimes.”

Felix scratched the back of his neck. “It might seem like that, but he’s doing this for a reason.”

I tilted my head slightly as I looked over at him. “He’s testing me,” I mused aloud. Felix snapped his calloused fingers and flashed a grin.

“See—you’re a smart girl. Think about it, how many out-of-towners flood this place with applications every summer?”

“A lot,” I responded as I pondered where he was going with this.

“Gotta weed out who can’t stick it out here.”

“Makes sense. I guess I am a long way from San Diego.”

He chuckled softly. “Miss the palm trees and beaches?”

“Nope. And don’t miss the traffic either.”

We both shared a soft chuckle as we entered the campsite, clearing our throats and putting our minds back to the task at hand. Felix called out in a professional, practiced voice that we were rangers with the park and needed them to turn down the music since it was past quiet hour.

We didn’t get a response. I shined my light around the campsite and noticed several camp chairs set up outside the radius of the fire’s glow. A few were knocked over, to no surprise. I saw some empty cans of Blue Ribbon and a few half-finished bottles of Jack Daniels. All classic choices for teens who didn’t understand what good booze was yet.

I took a few more steps into the campsite. The boombox was still blaring “Smells Like Teen Spirit” in the deserted campsite. I quickly picked up the scent of cigarettes from a still-lit cigarette resting in a crowded ashtray on a picnic table. Something wasn’t right here. Sure, they could be passed out asleep in their tents, but all these cars, all these tents, all these empty chairs—and not a single one is a snorer after a long night of drinking?

There was only silence in response to Felix’s announcement. We both exchanged looks even in the darkness of the unusual night; there was a hint of worry in the experienced ranger’s eyes. He quieted his voice and got a more focused glint in his eyes that I hadn’t seen before.

“Come on, let’s check the tents if anyone is in there.”

I nodded in agreement as I shined my light on the nearby tents. We both split off to check the tents for any occupants. I announced myself before zipping open a tent, expecting to find a drunken couple deep in the moment. But all I saw were empty sleeping bags, scattered magazines, and half-open duffel bags. Some had clothes scattered around on the tent floor—definitely kids my age. The only thing missing were the hammered frat guys sleeping away a night of boozing. I checked the other tents to find more or less the same.

Felix and I met back up near the campfire, both of us not finding the campers yet.

“It’s like they all just wandered off,” I said softly to him.

“They couldn’t have gone far; cars are still here.” He rubbed his chin thoughtfully as he shined his beam near the edge of the campsite. He seemed to focus on something I couldn’t see very well from the angle I was looking at it.

“Ash, come look at this,” he said as he walked over toward the edge of the campsite, shining the beam of his flashlight at something on the ground. I made my way over to his side.

“What is it?” I inquired as I squinted at what he was looking at.

“See some prints going into the woods—kinda looks like some drag marks too. There’s some wildlife tracks, too.”

“Drag marks?” I replied, furrowing my brow.

“Yeah… looks pretty fresh, too,” he added, a frown forming on his face.

“Think we should call Jake about this?”

Felix took in a deep breath as if in thought for a moment. “Not yet. I need to grab something from my truck—come on.”

I followed him to his truck; a sense of unease had begun to descend on me ever since we found the empty campsite. At this time I didn’t know why.

Felix opened the back door and dug through a large duffel. I almost asked what he was looking for—then he pulled it out. A strange rifle, loading it with a stripper clip of .308s.

It wasn’t like the long, sleek rifles in the glossy Cabela’s catalogs that came in the mail. This one was almost ugly. The wood was worn and unpolished, the barrel stubby but menacing, like it had come from another era. He racked the bolt with a sharp motion, then turned and looked back at me.

“What? It’s bear country, Ash.”

“Is that what you think happened? A grizzly snatched them?”

“I don’t know.” He sighed and rubbed his face with his free hand. “We do need to make sure they’re okay. I know if I called Jake he would just write it off or make us wait for hours till county gets here.”

“He would, so let’s give him something he can’t ignore.” He said as he put his flashlight back on his belt and replaced it with a headlamp.

We both set out to follow the drag marks. We didn’t say anything as we began to walk into the shadowy treeline.

Every couple of steps we called out if anyone was out there and if they were lost. Our voices reverberated across the pines. We shone our lights around our surroundings, looking for any signs of these drunk college kids. The night was still, soundless. Not even a single bird or bug could be heard. I couldn’t even feel any soft gusts of wind. I kept listening for the smallest sound, any kind of sign of someone lost out there.

I felt my stomach begin to swirl. We couldn’t even hear the music anymore—it was like the air itself was siphoning the sounds of the night away.

That’s when I finally saw it, hiding in a collection of vegetation. A pair of eyes staring back at me. I shined my light at it and my eyes widened. A young, teary-eyed woman stared back at me with blond hair like mine. She was kneeling down by a man that looked to be around the same age as her. A large, seeping gash was ripped across his leg. He didn’t seem to be conscious from the blood loss. One of the woman’s petite hands was tightly pressed against his wound; her other hand clutched his. Her face was deathly pale; I could see her whole body was shaking. She seemed to struggle to keep her breathing under control. Several times she kept opening and closing her mouth to say something to us, but her words refused to leave her mouth. She had several small cuts adorning her exposed arms. Her delicate face was cut up like she had been scratched by branches from a hasty escape. Who I assumed to be her boyfriend had similar cuts on his face.

I felt frozen in place as I put a hand to my mouth. I kept screaming at my legs to move but they wouldn’t; in fact, I couldn’t feel them at all. That girl’s face—desperate for anything, anyone that could escape this horrible place. I finally swallowed my fear and sprang into action—and so did Felix. I kneeled down beside the couple and set my bag down. I practically ripped it open to get my first-aid kit out.

Felix was faster than me; his hands were shaking less than mine. I yanked out some four-by-four gauze and started to press it into the wound as Felix started to get out some roller gauze and help me wrap the wound up. The girl still clutched his hand for dear life, never leaving his side.

I had to gently move her hand aside from the wound so I could help Felix bandage it up. She didn’t ever raise her voice or make much of a sound besides some almost-inaudible murmurs. Even though I couldn’t make out her exact words, I could tell she was praying.

“Ash, take care of him. I got him,” he said as he quickly took control of the situation. I took the woman’s bloodied hand into my own, not giving a shit about the blood right now. She turned her gaze to me, asking a silent question.

“We’ll take care of him, don’t worry,” I said in my best reassuring voice.

She quickly nodded and finally released her iron grip on her boyfriend’s hand. Felix quickly hefted the young man over his shoulder and nodded to me.

“Thank you…” the girl murmured to me as she held onto my hand tightly like it was her only escape.

“Come on, we need to go, okay?” I said gently to her as her green eyes flickered over to the trees deeper into the woods.

“But my friends are still out there!” she finally raised her voice to my surprise. Felix noticed my hesitation and answered for me.

“Look, miss, we need to get him to a hospital or he won’t make it. We’re gonna call for more rangers to find your friends, alright?”

This seemed to satisfy her well enough and she nodded a few times and sniffed.

“Right, I’m sorry—I just—”

“It’s alright, you don’t need to apologize. Let’s get you out of here.” I added as Felix started to jog back with the wounded man still over his shoulder. I led the terrified girl through the darkness by her trembling hand, flashlight in my other. I could hear Felix’s heavy footsteps crunching pine needles ahead of me.

“Are they gonna be okay?” she asked anxiously, her eyes darting all around.

“They’ll be okay,” I replied, not believing my own word. Even though I was definitely not alone, I felt something else—I didn’t even know how to describe it.

I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. I could feel eyes bearing their gaze upon me, but I couldn’t tell from where. I quickened my pace slightly, tugging on the girl’s arm to get her to move a bit faster.

“What’s your name?” I asked her, trying to take my mind off this sensation.

She hesitated for a few moments before finally speaking up.

“Jessica.” She tried to add a smile, but her nerves failed her.

“I’m Ash; the big guy who grabbed your boyfriend is Felix,” I said, looking over my shoulder at her with a soft smile. She slowly returned the smile with some hesitation.

I could tell we were getting close to the campsite by the sounds of grunge rock echoing through the shadowy trees.

We finally reached the dim glow of the campfire. I could see Felix by his truck with the young man laid out on the truck bed with the hastily made bandage now wrapped in Coban.

Felix stood close by, one hand resting on the edge of the truck bed, the other holding the receiver of an old Motorola bag phone. The bulky nylon case sat beside him, the coiled cord stretched just far enough to let him pace a little. I assumed he was calling Jake—or someone from the emergency line—but I couldn’t tell. His voice was low, tight. Whatever he was saying wasn’t for me.

Jess broke away from my grip and ran over to her boyfriend’s side. Even though he was still unresponsive, I could see his chest rising and falling, the slight vibrations in his chest from his still-beating heart.

As Felix was busy, I walked over to the boombox and finally shut it off. I turned back and made my way over to Jess’s side as she tapped her fingers on her boyfriend’s open palm. I finally asked the question that had been circling like a vulture on my mind this entire time.

“What exactly happened out there?”

I asked as I rested my arms on the top side of the truck bed. Jessica’s eyes averted mine as she stared at the ground.

“I don’t know…where to even start,” she said as she rubbed her face. I quietly waited for her to continue as I pressed a hand to her shoulder.

“One second we were drinking, having fun…then it was just—”

She paused as she wiped her eyes, taking a moment to compose herself.

“The music was so loud but I could still hear Eric screaming when it grabbed him.”

“Something grabbed him? An animal? A person?”

“I don’t know, I never got a good look at it. It started to drag him into the woods and…my legs just started moving on their own. I don’t know what came over me.”

I took a notepad out and started scribbling some notes as she spoke. It helped keep my shaking hands busy.

“What about your friends? Did they do the same?”

She gave me a short nod.

“They did, but I was first. I saw so much red. I grabbed the pocket knife he gave me for my sixteenth. I just stabbed it…again and again. It made such awful sounds—”

“Did…you kill it?” I asked with a raised eyebrow, and she gave me a slight shrug.

“I don’t know, but it let him go and everyone just scattered. I panicked—we all did. I didn’t know what to do besides hide and hope it didn’t find us again. It sounded like it was screaming like a person when I stabbed it.”

I stopped writing and looked up at her, truly at a loss about what she was describing. None of it made any sense to me. My only guess was a mountain lion or some psycho. Both sounded far-fetched the more I thought about it. Mountain lions prefer easy prey—people alone, isolated—not a packed campsite full of noise, even if they were starving.

Perhaps it was a person? Some kind of deranged psycho living in the woods, targeting clueless campers? Sounded like the plot of some shitty slasher—one with a masked serial killer. Then again, he would be a pretty bad one if all it took to stop him was a half-sober, petrified sorority girl with a pocket knife that probably hadn’t been used for anything besides cutting nails and whittling out of boredom.

A silence fell on us as we quietly waited for our backup. Felix stood closest to the wood’s edge with his rifle propped up on his truck. Every couple of minutes, he would turn on his headlamp and scan the treeline; he never saw anything. I draped a blanket around Jess—she wouldn’t stop shivering. Even as the minutes drew by, what felt like hours, my hands wouldn’t stop shaking, but I didn’t know why. The woods still didn’t make a sound even as I felt a gentle breeze brush upon my face.

Finally, we all heard the sound of approaching sirens in the distance. All three of us peeked our heads up. Our backup was here after what felt like an eternity. I first noticed the red flashing lights from a county ambulance with peeling paint, followed by a couple of our trucks—not the dull flashing amber lights like I had on my truck, just like your run-of-the-mill city cop, they had red and blue lights flashing brightly against the cedars and pines. At the back of this convoy was a single black-and-white county patrol car; I was honestly surprised they bothered to send one out here—must have been a slow night.

They quickly pulled into the turnoff for one of the empty campsites and killed the wailing of their sirens. The rangers stepped out first. They didn’t dress like us. Felix and I wore cargo shorts, faded T-shirts, tired polos with cheap name tags pinned on, and dusty hiking boots. These rangers wore tan collared shirts and dark green cargo pants, black Danners. I noticed quickly some wore those detestable wide-brimmed hats but a lot of them only wore baseball caps. Each of them wore a high-vis vest stamped with “LAW ENFORCEMENT” in large bold letters. They slung scoped game rifles or semi-auto shotguns—likely loaded with bear slugs—over their shoulders. A few of them carried bulkier, heavy-duty tranquilizer rifles with longer scopes. I noticed clunky handheld radios dangled from their belts. No doubt these were the usual guys they called in when the wildlife got bold. They didn’t say anything to us but Felix said we could help look for the missing campers.

These weren’t the rangers that smiled and waved from behind desks at the visitor centers or handed out trail maps at junctions. These were the guys you called to track and kill a thousand-pound grizzly that mauled a camper. These were the guys who carried bodies out of ravines. They worked in places where the nearest backup was hours away.

Small crowds began to gather, drawn by the lights and sirens screaming in well after quiet hours. Barefoot kids peeked out from dome-shaped Power Rangers tents, Game Boys in hand. The soft, sickly golden glow from their wormlights illuminated quietly worried faces. Flannel-clad dads sat in folding chairs outside their RVs, Miller High Lifes still cold from the cooler, trading guesses about why all the uniforms were out here. Mothers in hoodies gently tried to herd their kids back to bed. The flashing lights painted the pines in red and blue long after the sirens had gone quiet.

I looked over at the ambulance as two guys in plain navy-cargo pants and windbreakers carted away Eric on a stretcher with Jess hovering close by. One of the newly arrived rangers handed us some handheld radios and muttered something about not chasing after grizzly bears. They turned on dark green angle lights clipped to their vests and split into pairs as they carefully entered the treeline, their rifles held low. Our radios crackled with their chatter.

“Station, this is Ranger 8. We’re gonna need SAR volunteers rounded up to cover this much ground—over.”

“Copy that, we’ll assemble a search party. Standby.”

“10-4.”

I turned down the volume on my radio as Felix and I ended up being paired off together. I noticed the deputy they dragged along with them was talking to another guy not in any kind of uniform—button-up shirt and slacks with a badge clipped to his belt. A sidearm was concealed in a leather shoulder holster. I assumed he was some kind of detective. Not sure what he was gonna investigate in this neck of the woods.

I was sure this was just another rabid animal to be put down, just like the other reports. Felix still took the lead, the rifle hanging over his chest. I was glad to be paired up with him—from the way he was able to follow those tracks from before. All those hunting trips he had been taking with his son had finally paid off. I was a little bit jealous after the fact I never figured out why.

As we were walking under the shadowy arms of the spruces, flashlights in hand, I first smelled it—something that struck out from the usual scents of the forests of Montana. There was hardly even wind to carry it, so it took a second for me to register what I was smelling. Honestly, it was pretty repulsive when it finally hit me. I caught a whiff of what smelled like ammonia, like someone had been pouring jugs of bleach out in the middle of the woods.

I looked down to see if it had been something I had stepped on. I furrowed my brow as the dull golden beam of my flashlight reflected the sight of clotted droplets of blood clinging to pine needles and fallen leaves. The droplets continued down the makeshift game trail. Neither of us said a word to each other. Felix muttered a short transmission into the radio. He turned to me and we just exchanged a nod and kept going.

The smell only got stronger as we kept walking. The blood started to get more visible—going from sparse drops to scattered puddles. Felix started walking slower, taking more deliberate steps now, heel to toe, muffling the stomping of his boots crunching pine needles.

We finally reached the end of the blood trail. The smell was almost unbearable now; I felt lightheaded from the overwhelming stench.

We both stopped in our tracks at what we heard. From the sounds I could hear it making—how it wheezed—I could tell it was struggling to stay alive. It emitted a series of harsh gasps and sputters. I felt like I was about to throw up from even being near it. I squinted my eyes as I finally could make out where the sounds were coming from. A shadowy shape lay on its side staring at us from under a birch. Even though I couldn’t see its eyes I could feel them bearing their weight down on my skull.

I swallowed my nausea and fear and finally shined my flashlight on it. Our eyes widened at what we saw. I wanted to run away from this thing and never think about it, bury it out of mind, but my primal focus seemed to take hold.

I would have thought it was an elk if I had just glanced at it for a split second. But it wasn’t one—at least not anymore. It used to be a bull, still had those velvety furred antlers from an early summer. Its eyes were what struck me the most. They were clouded, colorless, like a corpse. I couldn’t even tell if they had pupils anymore. Its eyes kept twitching almost like they were loose in their sockets, about to pop out at any moment.

It was still laid out on its side. Its head raised to continue to gaze at us. Some of its fur was matted with blood; it looked like its own blood. Its jaws were entirely misshapen. I was about to wonder why when I got my answer. It opened its gaping maw—it had too many teeth. Rows and rows of newly grown incisors were tightly crammed into its original set of teeth, like a shark’s. Its newly grown teeth were coated in fresh blood. The sounds it made were like it was gurgling and choking on its blood. That’s when I finally noticed where Jess made her mark: sticking out from between its collarbone and shoulder was the hilt of a buck knife, blood still seeping from the fresh wound.

I shined my light down to its legs as it began to move. All four of its legs were bent and twisted into horrible angles; its length extended beyond the realm of possibility. Bones jutted out like spikes from its horribly mangled limbs. Despite the fact that it shouldn’t have been able to stand, let alone move at all, it still did.

Even with the distance between me and that thing, I still heard its legs crack and crunch as limbs began to snap and break in new ways with each passing moment. It should have been screaming, howling in agony, but it didn’t make a sound. It only let out soft retching and a sound of gagging. I felt bile begin to travel up my throat with every bone it snapped further into impossible angles.

Felix still had the rifle. “C-cover your ears,” he commanded with a slight wavering in his voice.

I didn’t question it or hesitate to do as he said.

I could tell Felix was trying to put on a brave face around me—not because he wanted to look macho or impress me or anything. He knew I would panic if a veteran ranger like him lost his cool. I could still hear it in his voice, the slight hesitation in his words. His normally tanned face was as pale as that thing’s eyes.

It was in the process of walking forward when I finally heard the deafening roar from Felix’s rifle. It didn’t seem to register that it had been shot. A gaping hole was now barreled in between its eyes—Felix wasn’t bullshitting about those hunting stories after all. Blood began to bleed from its new wound. It sat on its haunches and flexed its jaw a few times as it rocked its head up and down. It crumpled over to the side and began kicking its back legs wildly; after less than thirty seconds it let out a few more twitches before falling motionless entirely. A puddle of blood began to form under its slaw jawed face. Our radios started to squawk with questions on who fired that shot.

We both let out a collected breath that we had been holding this entire time. I heard the sound of Felix charging the bolt and ejecting the still-smoking brass from the chamber.

The scent of ammonia began to fade away as the scent of carbon and gunpowder filled my nostrils. I didn’t say anything, but with trembling hands he grabbed his radio and spoke into it.

“All stations… one round fired. Aggressive wildlife is down. Situation is… under control.”

There was a long silence on the air, and Felix spoke again, “Bring gloves.”

“10-4.”

I reached into my pack and got something I didn’t think I would be using at this moment but felt compelled to do. I grabbed my Polaroid camera.

It was a gift from Mom two summers ago before I left. I promised her I would take pictures of the park for her. I hung up pictures of hot springs in my locker—the breathtaking views of the snow-covered mountains and extinct volcanos from the balcony of a lonely firetower. I sent them back to Cali in half-crumpled envelopes. I never thought I would take a picture like… this.

The camera’s flash filled my vision as my camera spit out a newly printed Polaroid. I began to shake the photo as it developed. A small comfort was brought from doing such a mundane and familiar task. I expected Felix to say some cheesy one-liner from a trashy action movie to cut the tension, but he never did.

I looked over at him—the rifle now slung over his shoulder. He clutched it tightly, his fingers trembling, knuckles snow-white. I could hear his soft, unsteady breathing.

I reached out, quietly, and rested my hand on his arm.

He flinched at first, his head twitching toward me on instinct.

I didn’t pull away. Instead, I tightened my grip just a little.

He closed his eyes. Breathed in. Breathed out.

Then he nodded. “I’m fine, I just—” he softly murmured, not finishing his sentence.

I gently caressed his forearm with my fingertips before pulling my hand back. My fingers were still shaking.

The sound of dry leaves crunching approached us as the beams of two flashlights drew near.

We looked over to see two law-enforcement rangers walking quietly up to the body of the thing.

I expected them to say something as they shined their beams over what lay there, but they didn’t. One of them nodded at Felix, who still held the rifle, the barrel smoking ever so slightly.

The taller ranger set his bag down and pulled a bright-yellow Kodak from a smaller compartment inside a Ziploc bag.

He raised the camera and took a quick photo with a soft snap as the flash lit up the carcass. He stepped closer, focusing the lens on the hilt of the knife. Then he stowed the camera in his cargo pocket and scribbled down the frame number and a short note in a small notebook before giving a nod to the second ranger.

The second ranger unfolded a black tarp from his pack and draped it over the misshapen elk. He cracked a blue chemlight and taped it to the tarp with a strip of surveyor’s tape. One of them reached for his shoulder mic and spoke into it.

“Station, this is Ranger Three. We got a DB flagged with a blue chemlight. Northwest—eight hundred meters into the treeline, over.”

“Copy. DB marked with a blue chemlight. Southwest—eight hundred meters in, out.”

Neither Felix nor I said a word. I expected them to lose their composure, to stammer out some half-witted explanation of what we were looking at. But they didn’t. I could have sworn I heard one of them mutter another one under their breath.

This wasn’t their first time.

One of them finally looked over at us. “You two, head back. Jake’s waiting for you by the trucks.”

Felix nodded quietly. I didn’t move. He started to walk away but quickly noticed I wasn’t following—I was still staring at that tarp, the misshapen cloven hooves just barely visible from the edges. Felix put a hand on my back and gently urged me forward.

“C’mon, Ash…” he said quietly. I silently nodded and followed him back toward the trucks.

We didn’t say anything to each other during the walk back, but Felix was walking a bit slower than before. He kept the rifle close, holding it tightly. As we walked, he would shine his light in the trees as we passed them, but we never saw anything.

The flashing lights guided us through the quiet forest. It didn’t take long for us to get back to the campsite and all those emergency vehicles; the crowd was still there now, a few more strong after the gunshot they probably heard.

Among the lines of emergency was the shape of my supervisor—Jake was leaning up against his truck, reds and blues painting his face as he took a long drag from a lit cigarette while he spoke to what I assumed to be some kind of detective or government official from earlier. The ambulance had already left with the couple.

The two of them stopped their conversation as we approached them. The well-dressed man looked over at me and gave me a professional but warm smile. I’ll admit—he was a lot better-looking than most cops I’d seen. He was clean-cut, sharp as a razor, maybe a little older than what I usually go for. He honestly looked like he could have made it as an actor out in Hollywood if he tried.

“Ashley, I presume?” he said with practiced politeness. I nodded as he continued speaking.

“I know you’ve both had a long night so I won’t take up your time.”

He reached into his pocket and handed us two laminated cards.

“Here’s my card—if you want to talk about what happened after some rest, feel free to give me a call.”

I looked down at it and squinted slightly at the neatly printed text: “Detective Reid Callahan, Yellowstone County Sheriff’s Office,” followed by his badge number, phone number, office address, and fax number.

“Sure,” I said, nodding a little as I pocketed the card, feeling the need for sleep gnawing at my brain. Jake glanced over at me, noticing just how worn out I looked.

“Both of you did amazing work finding those two tonight. We’ll handle the rest. You two can take off and have the next few days off.”

We thanked him, and he tossed a pack of Marlboro Reds each. I didn’t smoke.

Felix and I silently shambled back to our trucks. Before he climbed into the driver’s seat, I wordlessly pushed the pack of smokes into his hand while trying to manage a smile, but it probably looked pretty pathetic. I could only stare as the flashing lights filled my vision and I wondered… why, just why did this have to happen to me? Why did this happen to us?",2,1767205489.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Here is the recipe (from a small bakery in Spain) for coffee cookies.   


Dough for 2 kg

Flour 800 g

Eggs 2

Powdered sugar 400 g

Instant coffee 100 g

Baking Powder 1 packet 

  
Yes, the recipe is kind of unconventional, but it's what I was given before leaving Spain. The cookies in the glass container are the ones from the bakery that I am trying to make. I tried baking them 4 times now and all 4 times they taste bad, and when I make the dough it is WAY too dry. I mean, I get the eggs in and it's almost as though the flour has not been impacted. Does anyone have any suggestions or similar recipes that I can try? I'm looking to make some biscuit-like texture cookies, they are soft and crumbly and taste amazing, of course. Thanks for any help!

I just realized I’ve never told you all of my pet’s names. So, be prepared to be amazed at the absolute wonderful world that is *my brain* muahaha!

Monster the hermit crab (I still wonder if I buried him alive in a shoe box in my backyard, didn’t learn about crabs molting until afterwards… oops 🦀)

Lassie the hamster (Wild fact: my Mama spent $300 to have a cancerous tumor removed from her back and she got stuck between our dishwasher once but starved herself skinny enough to get back out 🐹)

Sissy the hamster (Not my choice of names, my Mama chose hers, how uncreative. Anyway, she died on our way to California to see my Dad, I believe the same night Chris Farley died, and I buried her at his home 🪏)

Tony Montana the bearded dragon (Js dad’s obsession for 2.5 seconds then of course discarded, much like the other human children he has, and last I heard lived out his days with my old college roomie T 🐉)

Smeagle the tortoise shell cat (She was a sweetie but was unfortunately abused by Js father, had a mistrust for men but found solace in my Papa & littlest cousin J then lived out her last days with my childhood best friend V. I have actually never seen The Lord of the Rings in its entirety… maybe we can have a watch-a-thon? 👉🏻👈🏻)

Moto the red nose pit bull (He was the bestest boy ever, strong like bull but gentle like his Momma and I think my besties doggo is his lil less well behaved (we’re working on him) spirit brother. My friend that does hair where you got your hair did at one point in time adopted him when I escaped Js dad’s abuse until she had twin boys, then he went to the country in Dayton to spend his last days 🥰)

Bagheera the black cat (Js other parental unit was fond of collecting animals but not caring for them, like his human kids, however, he eventually kept my Papa company in his last days then retired to my Great Uncle’s home on some land in Manvel 🐈‍⬛)

Rufus the Australian Shepherd (technically named by my littlest cousin J and ‘gifted’ to us when he was 2; he was our family dawg and Jack’s BFF, our pride and joy, and the day after he passed I saw him with his Dad at a coffee shop 🐶)

Jackson aka Jackhole aka Fatboi the ginger tabby cat (My bestest boy ever, protector of the realm, and my comfort kitty that came to me the weekend my human son moved to AZ bc I was REALLY sad during that time and is inspiration for a future framed portrait tattoo😻)

Violet Tschotske the black cat (technically Js baby but I gave inspiration for both of her names; she was the ugliest lil girl but J saw something special in her and had to have her. She’s currently a beautiful college girl living her best life, annoying the shit out of her mom and sister and shooting snot rockets on the walls due to her allergies 😂)

Outlaw the gray and black tabby (Violet’s brother and my cousin C’s baby that was named in honor of my husband; he loved traveling with C for work and lived up to his name, even flooding his camper once while his dad was at work, but has since joined his Uncle due to kidney issues 😿)

Eleanor (sir)Doku Dennis the tuxedo (trans) kitty (Ellie was ‘gifted’ to me for Mother’s Day by J after the loss of Outie and was said to be a boy until we took him to get neutered, ha! Originally SirDoku (play on words for Sudoku) (btw encourage your mom to play brain games) became Eleanor Doku then Dennis was added because she had a very Menacing spirit at times! She was spayed that day, then she and Vi became a bonded pair so J had to adopt her because she knew how important she was to Violet, and now she’s a college girl too, kinda like how my BFF and I are because as long as I have a roof, she has a roof, ya feel me 🥹)

Honorable Mentions:

Biggie Smalls the Boston Terrier (my childhood BFF V’s bug eyed baby boy and our temporary roommate for 2 months after Hurricane Harvey, he’s with all his friends and cousins now too 🫶🏻)

Sargent the wire fox terrier (my cousin and former roommate K’s baby boy, there’s a video of him on my TikTok holding an egg in his mouth like a protective new Dad; he passed a year or so ago and is with his sister Marty and all his cousins now🥚)

Charlie the ginger tabby cat (My oldest son E’s pride and joy and namesake from It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Jack’s arch nemesis and biggest annoyance in his older years 👹)

Peggy the black and white kitty (Again, E’s lil momma, that he ‘found’ in a rainstorm and just HAD to take from her mother to give her proper food, shelter, and dewormer for her booty issues🙀)

Jessipa the tortoise shell kitty (she was a street kitty (ssshhhh we don’t shame working girls here) that was named after the bearded dragon on Platonic; she loved roaming around the previous home we resided in and was very protective of the block… she ran shit 😹)

Ok I think that covers it!

I love you. 😘 

I miss you. 😢 

I hope to see you soon! 👀
