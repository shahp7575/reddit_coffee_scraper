1oqjaji,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtlasBookClub/comments/1oqjaji/the_most_peaceful_part_of_my_day_is_reading_how/,The most peaceful part of my day is reading: how 20 minutes rewired my anxious brain,"Every day feels louder now. Notifications, group chats, constant scrolling, the algorithm screaming for your attention. It’s not just you. A lot of people feel emotionally fried. When I asked some friends what part of their day felt the most peaceful, almost everyone said one thing: *when they were reading*. 

Not reading headlines, or emails, or Reddit threads (ironically). I mean intentional, quiet, focused reading. A physical book, an undistracted Kindle, or even a long-form article you saved to Pocket. That 20-30 minute pocket of stillness hits different. And no, it’s not because we’re all becoming reclusive bookworms. Reading isn’t retreat. It’s repair.

There’s a ton of noise right now about self-care routines on TikTok. But most of them feel performative. Cold plunges. 7-step journaling. Biohacking light. Influencers stacking habits they barely understand. But if you look at the actual research from neuroscience, psychology, and cognitive therapy, the most effective and sustainable changes are often low effort, high depth. And daily reading is one of them.

So here’s a breakdown of why reading creates peace, based on science-backed findings, and how to build a habit that actually sticks.

* **Reading trains your nervous system to chill**
  * A 2009 study by the University of Sussex found that reading for just *six minutes* can reduce stress levels by up to **68%**, making it more effective than music, tea, or even walking. The researchers argued that reading forces the brain to focus on a single task, which lowers heart rate and eases muscle tension.
  * Dr. David Lewis, the cognitive neuropsychologist behind the study, explained it like this: “It works by engaging the imagination, as the words on the printed page stimulate your creativity and cause you to enter what is essentially an altered state of consciousness.”
  * Compared to passive scrolling, reading is active rest. Your attention gets anchored in a fictional world or a structured argument. That structured, linear absorption rewires your brain over time to tolerate stillness and focus.

* **It builds your attention span in a fractured world**
  * In his book *Stolen Focus*, journalist Johann Hari outlines how our attention has been systematically eroded. But he also points out reading as the antidote, describing how his ability to focus improved dramatically once he reintroduced daily reading sprints into his mornings.
  * Cognitive psychologist Dr. Maryanne Wolf explains in *Reader, Come Home* that our brains are plastic, and the decline in deep reading correlates with the rise in digital consumption. But neuroimaging shows that re-training our focus circuits through consistent reading can improve memory, empathy, and comprehension.
  * So if you feel like your brain’s attention span is cooked, the most effective fix probably isn’t more nootropics or dopamine detoxes, it’s carving quiet time for books.

* **Regular readers are less likely to feel lonely**
  * According to a study by the UK’s National Literacy Trust, people who read regularly are **28% more likely** to report greater life satisfaction and **22% more likely** to feel less lonely.
  * Fiction, especially literary fiction, improves theory of mind and empathy. This isn’t just academic fluff. A study in *Science* in 2013 showed that readers of literary fiction performed better on tests measuring social cognition, including recognizing emotions from facial expressions.
  * It’s wild, but true: when you read deeply, your brain simulates the emotional experiences of characters like it’s lived memory. That’s why good books feel like old friends. And why reading can reduce the ache of isolation.

* **Books are a portal to identity repair**
  * In *The Psychology of Reading*, Keith Rayner and colleagues talk about the idea of “narrative transportation” where readers become immersed in a story world. This immersive state can allow people to rehearse alternative identities or process unspoken emotions.
  * That’s why books like *The Midnight Library* by Matt Haig or *Man’s Search for Meaning* by Viktor Frankl resonate so deeply during crisis periods. They don’t fix your problems. They help reframe your identity within them.
  * Dr. Piers Steel, a leading researcher on procrastination, argues in his lectures that reading stories of people overcoming hardship can shift time perception and build what he calls “self-continuity,” your ability to imagine a better version of your future self.

* **Reading before bed transforms your sleep**
  * Sleep researchers at the Mayo Clinic recommend building a “wind-down ritual.” Reading physical books (not blue-lit screens) is one of the most consistent behaviors for improving sleep latency and deep sleep stages.
  * In one randomized study from the University of Essex, participants who read before bed fell asleep faster and reported better sleep quality than those who didn’t. 
  * And no, scrolling WebToons or Reddit doesn’t count. Your brain needs that low-stimulation wind-down. A paperback novel or a slow memoir does the trick better than melatonin.

So how do you actually build a reading habit that doesn’t flop after a week?

* *Start with something fast and juicy*
  * If you’re returning to reading after years of short-form content, start with thrillers or memoirs. Think: *Atomic Habits*, *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck*, *Before the Coffee Gets Cold*, or anything by Colleen Hoover. Don’t force literary classics right away.
  * Behavioral scientist Katy Milkman points out in her book *How to Change* that “temptation bundling” makes habits easier to stick. So pair reading with something cozy: a cup of tea, your comfiest hoodie, or a dedicated couch corner with a candle.

* *Use timers, not goals*
  * Don’t aim to finish chapters. Just set a 15 or 20-minute reading timer. James Clear explains in *Atomic Habits* that identity-based goals are stickier than outcome-based ones. So instead of thinking “I’ll read 30 books this year,” think “I’m becoming a person who reads every night.”
  * Use analog bookmarks and track your streak (even a simple wall calendar works) to get that satisfying feedback loop without turning it into a stats game.

* *Read physical if possible*
  * A meta-analysis in *Educational Research Review* found that comprehension levels are significantly higher when readers use print books versus digital. The tactile experience helps memory and engagement.
  * Plus, fewer distractions. No push notifications. No tabs. Just words on a page.

* *Join a low-pressure reading group*
  * Apps like Fable or Reddit book clubs let you read with others at your pace. Don’t underestimate how much social accountability helps fire up dopamine and keep interest alive.
  * If you're solo, follow book YouTube channels or BookTok accounts that share non-snobby recs. Suggestions like *The Psychology of Money*, *The Mountain Is You*, or *Quiet* by Susan Cain regularly come up for a reason—they're insightful but easy to digest.

Reading won’t fix your life in one week. But if you carve a small window in your day, just 20-30 minutes, something in your brain starts to rewire. You feel less reactive. Less scrambled. More anchored. And over time, that becomes the most peaceful part of your day.

1oqja2r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqja2r,Montagave Volume III,"To start off, I really love this brand. John & Lucie are super cool people (I’ve never met them), but they personally respond to customer emails within 24 hours, and after missing the pre-release on this bottle, I reached out to John and he made it happen, which was really cool. I grew up in a European + wine focused family, so Montagave pushing the boundaries of cask experimentation appeals to me. On the back of all their bottles is a note about creating and sharing memories with an open space to write something special about the bottle. I opened this the week my first daughter was born. 

NOM 1123

94 proof, 47% ABV

3 barrels producing only 804 bottles. 

Brick oven 72 hours 

Roller mill

Stainless steel fermentation 

Deep well water

2x copper pot distilled

10 months in French Oak barrels, then transferred into Port casks for an additional 6 months. 

**Aroma:**Cooked agave, vanilla, and toasted oak lead into dark chocolate, dried fig, and red berry notes from the Port finish.

**Palate:**Rich and full-bodied with layers of caramelized agave, black cherry, cocoa, and warm spice balanced by French oak tannin and minerality.

**Finish:**Long and structured with lingering port fruit, roasted coffee, oak spice, and a dry, earthy fade.

I love this, especially going into the cooler season. Im a sucker for higher proof aged expressions, and this one delivers. Volume II is much brighter; honey, apricot, floral, and melon that is perfect for Spring/Summer time. Volume III is darker, dryer, and spicier. Drinking both side by side is a treat.

I'm mainly looking for general comments about the plot and how the reader feels about the plot as it unfolds. I essentially want to make sure I'm hitting all the right narrative and emotional beats throughout each scene and chapter. I'm less worried about the mechanics of my writing; HOWEVER, if there's a sentence that is clearly confusing or strange to you then definitely let me know.

I don't need it read fast, but I'd prefer it be finished in 5 or 6 weeks. If you need a bit more time that's cool as well.

  
**CONTENT WARNING (whole MS):** Attempted teen suicide, brief gory descriptions, violence

  
Here's the blurb I'll be using in my query:

  
An electronic apocalypse cripples the nation: cars stop, phones power off, and modern life ends in a blink. But for twenty-one-year-old Cam Capitle, the collapse is the perfect opportunity to reunite with his teen brother, Michael, whom he saved from committing suicide over two years ago. Now living across the country after a falling out with his divorced mother earned him a restraining order, Cam bottles his grief for those two long years.

Traveling through a starving America, Cam meets a charming woman and her brother. With her, he’s freed from grief, and with her brother, Cam rediscovers siblinghood. But when asked about his family, Cam’s lies to reframe the past threaten their trust. The lawlessness of this new world and his obsession with belonging alter him the longer he travels with them, and Cam, who has always put family first, must decide what he’s willing to let go: a brotherhood by blood or a brotherhood by bond.

Meanwhile, fifteen-year-old Michael struggles to find purpose without Cam’s guidance—whose name is practically forbidden in their house. Instead, he has to endure his whiny little brother, Kyle. When the blackout hits, their neighborhood unifies. But life unravels: mom is stranded, raiders attack, and starvation threatens the neighborhood—and Kyle. Terrified of losing another sibling, Michael takes the mantle of older brother, learning to become what Cam once was to him. In another world, Cam may have disagreed with Michael’s methods, but stealing food from the community can save Kyle—even if it puts a deadly target on their family.

Not that it matters. Cam’s gone forever anyway. Right?

\----------------

And here's an excerpt from the opening chapter:

# Chapter 1

*Plano, Texas* 

*11.10.2028*

 

His younger brother Michael almost drowned himself. They couldn’t tell Mom. 

Cam clenched the steering wheel. White headlights blazed against the garage door of Mom’s house, the car’s humming a slight comfort for his bobbing knee. Cam sensed Michael’s stare coming from the passenger seat, young and probing, probably wondering how far they would go to maintain secrecy.

With a push of the starter button, the headlights darkened, and the battery fell silent. Michael stopped fiddling with the camera battery Cam had left in the cup holder. “Are you gonna tell Mom or Kyle?”

Cam would lie to the pope and back for Michael if he wanted Mom or their little brother Kyle out of the loop. But they’d needed to get their stories aligned for this lie to work.

“You were gone for a while,” Cam said, voice tight. “She’s gonna ask why I’m here with you suddenly. I haven’t been here in weeks.”

Michael turned his head away.

“Just say you went for a walk, and I’ll talk to her.” The cover story: Cam was driving by and saw Michael walking, so he picked him up and brought him home.

Cam drew in a shaky breath as he stepped out of the car into the dry air, Michael following, illuminated by the softness of a neighborhood streetlamp. They converged at the front door, and he patted Michael’s back, the best assurance he could give in the moment. He hadn’t seen Michael or Kyle since Mom’s last outburst. “I’m with ya every step of the way, dude,” Cam said. “Long as you have my back, we’ll be fine.”

They entered the home through a wall of air conditioning. An aroma of cilantro from Mom’s salsa whetted Cam’s hunger.

Their mom Rio stood up from the blanket-draped couch, squeaking the furniture’s legs against the floor. “Michael? Where’ve you been?” 

Michael snuck past Cam, snagging a tortilla chip from an open bag in the kitchen counter and offering her a shrug. “Went for a walk.”

She redirected her ire to Cam, nostrils flaring. “And you picked him up?”

Her tone sounded so raw, it drained Cam’s remaining confidence. Heat climbed up his neck into his cheeks.

“Yeah. I saw him near the park down the road.” Did that make sense or sound believable?

Mom side-eyed Michael. “Get ready for bed. Tell Kyle too.”

Michael met Cam’s eyes, his cheeks sagging as he trudged up the stairs. Michael was so lifeless these days. Cam hadn’t been here for him lately with all the overtime at the warehouse, the consequences of which were etched into his brother’s drab face. Michael had broken down in Cam’s arms an hour ago, spilling about his failing friendships at school and the mental toll of Mom’s growing hostility since the divorce six months ago. How could she not see the heartbreak she was causing?

Mom stared at Cam with a gaze powerful enough to intimidate a drill sergeant. Cam strolled through the living room as if he hadn’t been there a hundred times before, looking everywhere but Mom’s jagged glare. Framed photos of young Michael and their younger brother Kyle lined the slate-colored credenza next to a lamp. Kyle’s dimpled smile on his first day of third grade. Seven-year-old Michael with that toothy grin atop a horse. On the circular dining table sat an uncorked bottle of Merlot by a crumby plate. Shit. Had she been drinking? The last time she drank around them, she threw pillows and broke a lamp given by their grandfather. Then she threatened to throw her wine glass near Kyle while she ranted about Dad’s obnoxiousness.

Cam’s hands shook harder the longer she remained silent. He stuffed them in his jean pockets to hide them as he fell into the wingback chair. Whatever she might ask Michael, he had to lie. He’d promised.

Mom swiped her coffee-brown curls and crossed her arms. “You wanna tell me what happened? He left his phone here and walked out without telling me, and now you come back here with him. He looks like someone sucked the life out of him. Like he’s depressed or something. He wasn’t like that earlier today.”

His stomach tensed while he mentally cycled through every possible excuse. She’d believe his bullcrap like the last six arguments. “Nothing happened. He was having a hard time at school and needed to take a walk.”

“He’s been distant with me for weeks.” 

“Stuff at school is bothering him. It happened to me when I was in eighth grade.”

Mom lifted the crumby plate from the table and set it in the sink. “No. There’s something else. He doesn’t answer me when I ask him questions, and he doesn’t look me in the eye anymore.”

“It’s *school*. Michael told me.” Cam maintained eye contact, attempting to establish some sense of veracity in his demeanor, but her eyes were a fiery red, searing off his defenses the longer he looked.

“So, he told you but not his own mother?”

Cam swallowed a curse word that threatened to come out. How could he tell her she’s directly responsible for Michael’s distance? Or a damn suicide attempt? How could he ever be honest with her when she’s this volatile and somehow managing to get worse every time they collided? If he didn’t lie for Michael, she’d find someone other than herself to blame, then she’d send Michael to some mental hospital away from everyone—away from Cam.  

Not happening.

1oqj8t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/phnursing/comments/1oqj8t5/being_a_board_topnotcher_is_something_to/,"Being a Board Topnotcher is something to celebrate and brings brief fame, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t really matter in the real world.","I hope I had the will and time to post this before years ago pa. I took the PNLE in November 2023. Since it's PNLE season, I think I should share my story because I know someone out there ay makaka-relate. 

High school pa lang ako, I was destined to enter nursing school sa College. I even told my family na I would rather take a BSED since gusto kong maging English teacher sa mga forein kids since malaki-laki din ang salary and I see myself enjoying that kind of career since I'm focusing on languages. Mahilig kasi ako sa foreign languages. Di sila pumayag kasi mas practical daw ang Nursing. I am a nurse now and I'm happy sinunod ko ang advice nila even tho it was forced lol. Nursing is oversaturated sa Pinas as for teachers, it's twice than that! 

Back then, di na ako nag-isip isip pa kasi tanggap ko na na nursing ang kukunin ko. Wala akong choice. Coming from an 18-year old boy na di kayang magrebelde and go against father's wishes. This nursing school na in-enrollan ko is known for producing Board Topnotchers talaga. I didn't even know that before, na-discover ko lang during interview. Nung nalaman ko yun, naging ultimate plan ko maging Board topnotcher din.  Secret goal ko din yun. I didn't tell anyone about it. I just want them to be shocked be proud of them pag nangyari yun. Pag maging 1st placer daw kasi bibigyan daw ng 100k at pag 2nd to 10th place daw ay bibigyan daw ng 50k. To my 18-year-old self syenmpre malaki laki na yun. Pwede ko na yun ipambili ng latest iphone or magpaderma para maging clear skin na ako. Also, if maging topnotcher ako, sign na din yun para sa akin na I was meant to be a doctor since being a topnotcher means pwede kang mag-avail ng free tuition for Med school. Downside of this, magrereturn service ka sa sister hospital ng school which is so not recommended btw kasi mababa ang sweldo kasi private.

All those four years, nag-hirap ako from studying. Almost juggling lecture topics during class and book topics forthe PNLE. I was aiming reading the nursing textbooks from cover to cover unfortunately, di ko yun nagawa kasi it was an unrealistic goal. First year pa lang ako, I studied everything wholeheartedly na para bang lahat mag-aappear sa board exam. Yung lectures sa class namin, mostly PPT nag gamit at trinatranscribe lang ng mga batchmates ko para maging reviewer namin for the quizzes and exams pero ako I was multitasking everything. Studying for the quizzes/exams and reading the chapters in the textbook associated with those topics sa lecture. Even holidays and free time, palagi akong nagstustudy kasi I thought I had no time to waste. I only managed to completely read ***Psychiatric-Mental Health Nursing by Videbeck*** cover-to-cover. About 50% naman sa **Kozier & Erb's Fundamentals of Nursing**. 25% on **Maternal & Child Health Nursing by Pillitteri.** That's a rough estimate. How do I know? I logged and tracked every book I read on Goodreads. 

Fast forward, hindi ako naging topnotcher. I was heartbroken for weeks after seeing the top 10 list tas wala ang pangalan ko dun. Selfish confession: I'm happy walang nag-top sa aming batch kais it would really break my heart if meron topnotcher sa amin and it's not me or including me. It's crazy na what I thought mattered so much parang wala na lang ngayon sa akin. That was only 2 years ago pero I wish I just stopped and took a break, breathe and enjoy the present. Palagi akong nagdedecline sa mga bet-together sa mga friends ko kasi I thought every time is a potential study time. I wish I spent more time with my classmates and had fun. Do I regret being obsessed with being a topnotcher? About 30% no kasi every nursing material and exams I took, it was easier for me kasi mas marami akong nabasa in college. I would say 70% yes kasi I was so stressed to the point nag iistress-eating ako especially nung papalapit na nung boards. I was drinking lots of coffee and coke. I even pulled an all-nighter the night before our PNLE. 

It doesn't matter now or should I say my current self is not that affected much anymore baka nga dahil nasa ibang phase na ako ng life ko ngayon. I'm way happier now. NCLEX-RN passer na din ako and I was actually confident that I would pass kasi I religiously studied in College. Di rin ako ng enroll ng review center for NCLEX kasi ako lang ang nagfufund ng NCLEX expenses ko pati flight and accommodation sa Metro Manila. I'm also earning way more than 95% of my batchmates. Nasa bedside ako but nasa public hospital. Salary Grade 15: earning 54k per month pero 44k net pay kasi 10k ang tax. Hahahaha tangina. 

Even though, I did not become a topnotcher, I'm lowkey glad kasi kung nagtopnotcher ako I would undoubtedly avail the free Med school tuition + return service that means stuck ako sa Pinas and would have a stable career (naman) sa Pinas pero I won't get to migrate as easy and as young as being a nurse. 

I am 25 now. I would tell you kung anu-ano ang ganaps ng aking batchmates now: isa pa lang ang working abroad and nasa Saudi siya. Marami na din ang nakapasa ng NCLEX sa amin pero stuck pa rin dahil sa US retrogression. 3-5 people lang sa amin (I wouldn't tell the exact number for privacy concerns) ang nag-proceed sa Medicine, idk kung meron pang mag-proproceed. Most of us are working sa private hospitals na meron lang 20k per month salary on average. Ang iba nasa public hospitals pero di pa rin nareregular. Marami na din ang naging hyperfocused sa fitness and being physically active (I'm soo happy for them). Marami na din ang kinasal at nabuntis at may anak na. I would say the majority of us are just enjoying lives as it is. Pinaka-ultimate goal namin in this phase? To become an RN in the US. Sino kaya ang mauuna? Yan ang always hot topic kasi most agencies require active bedside experience until makapunta ka sa US. Most of us can't afford to stay in our jobs with crappy salaries. Marami na din ang nag-resign from bedside kahit hindi pa nag-1 year. My choice is to pursue another country, save money and travel around while staying bedside until makapunta sa US. 

Nga pala, if I would to redo the board exam shit all over again, I would take Q&A quizzes as many as possible per day. This made my NCLEX exam easier. I highly suggest reading **Lippincott Q&A Review for NCLEX-RN**. I read it cover-to-cover. Once I finished it, I was confident na to take the NCLEX. Hot take: this really depends and this will be very controversial, kung enrolled ka sa review center for PNLE and tinatamad ka, wag ka nang pumasok HAHAHAHAHA. Self-studying is superior kasi during lectures, yung mga topic na dinidiscuss, alam ko na so I think I was just wasting time. Pumapasok lang ako para makapag show-off ng new outfits sa mga classmates and people from other schools, pag may mock exams (kasi minomonitor ng dean namin), at kung may free food. Sayang tangina, yung last day ng review may pa-ice cream di ako pumasok kasi I was heavily depressed sa bahay while studying and drowning myself in coffee. Do practice questions! Especially yung mga for NCLEX kasi one of my lecturers sa other review center na I enrolled secretly personally told me that during their PNLE, super dami ang lumabas na mga Q&A for NCLEX books. Di siya nagsabi ng specific book kasi di na niya maalala. I think it should be Saunders or Lippincott. Sila kasi yung sikat. 

My credentials: 

PNLE rating 87.00

Top 10 rating: 89.20

In theory, 21st place ako sa aming PNLE. 

Btw, makakareceive na din ako ng year-end bonus ngayong November 10 worth 40k. So, Merry Christmas! Can't imagine if med student ako ngayon that is If I topped the boards. Pag maging RN na kayo, try kayo mag-apply sa mga tertiary public hospitals super laki ng sahod at daming bonuses pero paswertehan na lang kung may vacancy. Mabilis din turnover ng nurses kasi marami ang nakakapag-abroad. I would say it's a good stepping stone especially sa mga nagfufund ng NCLEX gamit ng own expenses. ",1,1762484495.0,phnursing,0,1.0,False

I always go to the warehouse to do my shopping, but my friend told me about same-day delivery to my area and I would love to avoid the chaos of in-store shopping if I can. 

I typically buy coffee pods, meats, and toiletries at Costco so it's usually a once a month shopping trip.

I decided to place a same-day order. The time slots were as follows:
1:58pm - 2:58pm with a 2$ fee
2:58pm - 3:58pm with no charge
After 3:58pm with a 2$ discount

I had a doctor's appointment at 2pm and I would be home by 3 so I went with the second option that had no fee to ensure I was home when it was delivered.

I got an email from Costco during my appt that notified me of delivery at 2:05pm. I knew that I wouldn't be home for almost an hour and my food would be left unattended.

I live in a rural area with lots of wildlife that wreak havoc if given the opportunity. When I got home at 2:55, the first thing I saw was my meat ripped open and I was gutted. I spent $140 which is less than we normally buy, but it's a lot to lose because I'm off work due to an injury right now and I can't afford to throw any away 

I immediately submitted a refund request because I explicitly chose the time slot that wouldn't leave the food unattended, but it was delivered earlier than I agreed to resulting in loss of food. 

I got a response this morning basically saying that they've seen my request, that the time slot was actually from 11:38am (2 minutes after my order was placed) and 3:58pm and they are denying my request. 

So I submitted a ticket with Costco who told me that I ordered directly through instacart (no I didn't, I ordered on the Costco app), and that they couldn't do anything for me. 

And then instacart sent me another email saying that they've checked and are standing firm in their decision. 

So ya, I won't be getting a refund and I've accepted this even though it really pisses me off, but I figured I'd warn people that just because you choose a window doesn't mean your order will actually come in that time frame and they don't care how you feel or what you lose lol.

1oqj7ex,https://www.reddit.com/r/Candida/comments/1oqj7ex/where_im_at_with_this/,Where I'm At With This,"So, I think this all started because I've always had a huge sweet tooth. 

As a kid, I had strawberry milk with marshmallows almost every night. My grandfather with whom I stayed during the summer would often let me eat marshmallows straight out of the bag. I was a picky eater, but I loved breakfast food with plenty of syrup.

As a teenager, I lived off pop tarts, cookies, and soda. I didn't even bring a lunch most days. I started drinking coffee then, and I developed a real caffeine addiction. Even when I tried switching to tea, I was drinking 6+ tea bags of black tea daily. This is when the mental health issues started, routine anxiety and depression, but things did get really grim for a minute there.

In college, I relied way too much on energy drinks and coffee. My diet was horrible. Then, I started working at a cafe and literally had a fridge full of free pastries that I would eat regularly, not to mention free drinks . That's when I got what I thought was athlete's foot. (Also terrible UTI symptoms that ended with me peeing blood and desperately taking cranberry pills because I didn't have health insurance.)

I changed my socks more often and my foot stopped itching and the peeling isn't bad, and it doesn't seem to spread, but ten years later, it's still there, even with creams, using head & shoulders, and peroxide soaks. I kicked the caffeine habit finally. After I had kids, I started having bad gastro issues - diarrhea every morning, stomach cramps, constipation... My doctor said it was probably IBS and told me to provide a stool sample, which I never did because the thought repulsed and mortified me. Plus, the $500 office visit really turned me away from medical professionals.

I developed a rash on my lips and hand in two places: the palm by my thumb and in between my thumb and index finger. These keep peeling and cracking painfully, leaving open wounds. I also noticed a little whiteness on my tongue, so I got a tongue scraper. I tried the low FODMAP diet a few months ago, and got some stomach relief by cutting out fructans, but the diet is hard for me to stick to. Bread seems to do the most damage.

The rashes didn't go away, so I did some more digging and that led me here to candida overgrowth. I've been trying to follow the diet, but I slip up sometimes. I noticed that every time I ate sugar, my lip rash would get worse. 

The past four days, I've strictly had no sugar and no caffeine. I hate it, but my lip rash is clearing up, however, my hand is cracking again and it really hurts! I've been drinking plain kefir and sometimes apple cider vinegar, although I now know there's some debate on whether they help or hurt. 

I also started doing a small intermittent fast between 10pm and 10am. I'm about 100lbs, and my body is very sensitive to change, so I'm trying not to go too hard and end up fainting somewhere. I'm sure I'm not getting enough calories. I'm so hungry all day. I don't feel ""full,"" although I might've been equating full with bloated, because it's only bread that makes me feel really full. The last two mornings, I've had bad leg cramps, which I think are due to some kind of deficiency. I've also been making different teas, first ginger, clove, and cinnamon, and now I've been adding turmeric (I've been adding turmeric to my eggs and chicken as well.)

I'm kind of putting all my eggs in this basket, hoping that if I can get rid of this possible overgrowth, I can cure my rashes, stomach problems, and mental stuff, but I don't know if I'm doing anything right. I don't know if this is helping. I've had some weird poops that I think had little yellow balls in them, and there were (this is embarrassing to type) white discharge-like clumps in the toilet when I peed yesterday that I thought could've been yeast, although it could just be normal discharge. It's not in my underwear, though, only when I pee. Maybe it's die-off? Maybe it's Maybelline? I dunno.

Oh, I also have been smoking weed since college, about three times a day now, but I'm on an unrelated tolerance break this week and next (shoutout to Jabria, Cannabis Coach).

I don't know, it seems like everyone else has yeast infections or worse thrush, and my comparatively milder symptoms make me unsure if I even have candida. All I know is, I want to be able to eat a pastry with some tea or coffee. Restrictive diets suuuuuuuuck. I still eat hash brown patties sometimes and rice. I still have gluten-free pancakes and waffles. There seems to be so much conflicting information and I don't know how to survive on just vegetables, eggs, and chicken. I feel very weak and get heart palpations that seem to be alleviated by beef.

I'm not even sure why I'm writing this. Looking for advice? Common experiences? Encouragement? Just wanted to get it all out? I don't really know. I just have no idea what I'm doing (story of my life, amiright?).

1oqj5kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1oqj5kb/is_there_potential_interest/,Is there potential interest?,"Hi everyone! I (29F) have the biggest crush on a recent friend—we’ve known each other a little over a year now—and I swear it feels like fate. 

Long story short, I am coming up on a year of being single after ending a 2 year relationship. I had suspicions along the way, but finally confirmed that my ex-boyfriend had been cheating on me the week of Thanksgiving (thank goodness I trusted my gut before sitting through another holiday season).

My crush is also recently out of a relationship. He was with his now ex for 11 years (high school, college, obv post-grad), engaged for 2 out of those 11 years. She ended things with him the day after Christmas of last year. Multiple mutual sources said that she told him that she wanted different things. It’s still amicable… their families still follow each other on social media/he still has photos of her up, but I heard that he was devastated.

Fast forward, we worked on a business project together (the company I worked for at the time contracted him for certain product launches). He posted a behind-the-scenes of me on his IG story, little did we know at the time that I knew his cousin. The next time I saw him he said “I didn’t know you knew my cousin! She replied to my story of you the other day saying that she loved you. How do you two know each other?” I went onto explain that I grew up with his cousin from 3rd grade through college—they’re half-Greek, so I know all about Greaster (Greek Easter), Papou, YiaYia, etc.—he lit up! His brother was also there like “how does this girl know about Greaster?” Everyone is the room was like “What is Greaster?” He also complimented a pair of my shoes that I made look like the Miu Miu x New Balance collab for under $70 hehe—my ex didn’t understand it, so for him to notice and mention it also had me blush. 

The city we live in is a big small town (huge tourist destination as well), so everyone knows each other and is always bumping into each other. I got mat pilates certified over the summer at the best gym in town—he is a member, so I would bump into him while studying or leaving a class.

I needed some men to teach for practice hours, so I reached out to him. It went from him saying he’d bring a couple of friends to him bringing me 8 of his guys friends on a Sunday during Labor Day Weekend! Most were half hungover and still showed up for a girl they’d never met. He gave me really kind and thoughtful feedback and said he couldn’t wait to book a class with me.

A few weeks ago, I asked him to coffee. We talked for 2 hours about career and personal life. I briefly mentioned how my ex cheated and how I about to go to jail at 6AM that morning (just kidding—I quickly told him I wasn’t violent) and he  respectfully mentioned how his ex ended things the day after Christmas and how he had to go to his cousin’s engagement party on NYE - he cried and his brother gave him a napkin. Most wouldn’t know, but I’m super anxious. My brain is always still when I’m around him, I feel safe and seen. He held the door for me, gave me a hug, and double-texted me after a newsletter he had mentioned to me. Other than that, that’s been it.

He watches all of my IG stories or is one of the first ones to view. He is very busy, when he met up with me for coffee, he had just gotten back into town from being on the road for 13 days for work. He is super responsive to my texts (he reads and responds right away, and this man is BOOKED). 

He is so handsome, kind, creative, hardworking, supportive, etc. One of my best friends also attended a Greek wedding he and his family were at, and the bride raved about him to me during a night out after the rehearsal dinner (he wasn’t there).

Does it sound like there could be some sort of interest? It’s hard to gauge due to his past—I’m not in a rush, but feel like between the cousin connection, similar holiday heartbreaks, creative careers, and similar interests are tying us. I feel in tune with this guy… I reached out regarding pilates and coffee, so I want him to reach out. It’s been 2ish weeks since I’ve heard from him :(

Thanks all!

Signs point to renewed momentum: a hefty bonus for Samsung's HBM4 development team, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's encouraging remarks and Samsung's early ramp-up of HBM4 production all suggest a bright outlook for the Korean tech giant's memory business.  
   
Samsung’s latest HBM4 chips are currently undergoing verification testing by major client Nvidia — a crucial milestone that could determine its comeback in the high-end memory market. Although the fate of the high-performance memory for AI training chips largely hinges on Nvidia's adoption, sentiment around HBM4 is markedly more optimistic than it was for HBM3.  
   
Thirty members of Samsung’s memory division received a combined 5.1 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in company shares on Oct. 31, an unusual incentive move tied to their success in developing the company’s newest 10-nanometer-class 1c dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process. This was the first time Samsung has granted treasury shares to developers, and also the first instance in which the company has officially disclosed the incentive. Industry watchers say the incentive signals positive feedback from Nvidia regarding Samsung’s HBM4 performance.

Nvidia chief Huang, during a press briefing in Gyeongju, North Gyeongsang, on Oct. 31, praised Korean companies’ memory technologies and described Samsung as a “key supply partner for HBM3E and HBM4” in a same-day statement announcing a major Blackwell processor supply deal. The recognition marks a turning point for Samsung, which previously struggled to secure Nvidia’s validation for its HBM3 and HBM3E products due to yield and quality challenges in its 1b process — an opening that allowed SK hynix to take the lead in the memory market.  
   
   
Both Samsung and SK hynix are expected to supply HBM4 chips for Nvidia’s next-generation Rubin processors, slated for mass production in the second half of 2026 — a timeline Huang confirmed during his remarks to the Korean press. KB Securities analyst Kim Dong-won projects Samsung’s HBM shipments could surge as much as fourfold by 2026, buoyed by orders for HBM3E and HBM4.  
   
The company is in the midst of converting the DRAM production lines at its latest plants in Pyeongtaek and Hwaseong, Gyeonggi, to 1c DRAM, to ""actively carry out investments necessary"" to expand production capacity, according to Kim Jae-june, Samsung Electronics' vice president in charge of memory chips, said at a conference call on Oct. 30.   
   
   
**Logic die yield points to mass production readiness**  
Adding to the optimism, reports indicate that Samsung’s foundry division has achieved a yield rate exceeding 90 percent for its 4-nanometer logic die — a critical component of the HBM4 architecture. The logic die, often described as the “brain” of the memory stack, connects the DRAM layers to the GPU and manages power distribution and data transmission in AI systems. A 90 percent yield suggests that 9 out of 10 chips are fully functional, implying that the process has matured enough for mass production.  
   


SK hynix's fifth-generation high bandwidth memory (HBM3E) is displayed at the chipmaker's booth for SK AI Summit held at Coex in Gangnam District, southern Seoul, on Nov. 3. \[YONHAP\]

   
As Samsung’s Suwon-based facilities ramp up HBM4 sample production for customers such as Nvidia and AMD, the company’s foundry division is said to have devoted nearly half of its 4-nanometer line capacity to logic die output, outlining its focus on next-generation memory components.  
   
By combining 1c DRAM and the 4-nanometer logic base die, Samsung could boost its HBM4 processing speeds to 11 gigabits-per-second (Gbps), higher than the 9-10 Gbps expected from SK hynix and Micron's HBM4 offerings, making its memory a better fit for Nvidia's Rubin chips.   
   
However, Samsung trails SK hynix by about two months in obtaining Nvidia’s approval, a delay that could reshape the HBM4 market outlook in both the short- and long-term. SK hynix is expected to take the early lead, benefiting from first-mover advantage in production volume and pricing power. Over the longer term, analysts project that Samsung will rapidly gain market share as its technology matures and production capacity scales up.

“As new HBM4 supply comes online, competition among vendors will intensify. Ultimately, the market could settle with SK hynix holding around a 50 percent share, Samsung a 30 percent share and Micron a 20 percent share.” Kiwoom Securities analyst Pak Yu-ak said.   
   
   
**Chip supercycle seen extending through 2027**  
Analysts expect the ongoing semiconductor upcycle to persist through 2027, despite mounting speculation of an AI-driven market correction. In a sign of confidence, Korean brokerages are shifting their valuation frameworks for chipmakers from price-to-book (PBR) to price-to-earnings (PER) ratios — a recognition that the memory business may now be entering a phase of more stable, structural growth.  
   
SK Securities set target prices of 1 million won for SK hynix — a record-high figure — and 170,000 won for Samsung Electronics, both based on earnings multiples for the first time. Traditionally, the cyclic nature of memory markets made book value a more dependable metric than volatile earnings, but analysts say the paradigm is changing.

“It’s time to ask whether PBR is still the right yardstick for valuing memory chipmakers in the AI era,” said Han Dong-hee, analyst at SK Securities. “As profits stabilize and long-term structural growth continues, the logic for using PBR will weaken.”  
   
Han added that tight production capacity among major players is expected to sustain higher prices in the coming years.  
   
Market tracker CTT Research echoed the sentiment, forecasting that demand for DRAM and NAND chips will continue to outpace supply amid robust AI infrastructure investment and expanding data center buildouts. “Despite a few risk factors, the memory market is expected to stay in a favorable cycle at least through the first half of next year,” the report said Wednesday.

Sorry for invading your feed, but I’m working on something I care about a lot, and I think some of you might relate as to why.

I studied abroad in Beijing last year for a language immersion program and had an absolute blast. My Chinese friends showed me around all these amazing spots and hidden gems I never would have found on my own. I truly felt like I was living Chinese culture, not just observing it from the outside. It's one thing to visit a place, but to truly experience it is completely another thing.

After my time in China, I did a tour around East Asia with my best friend I made in the program. She had some free time and had very similar travel interests and style as I did (night markets, temples, street food). We had the most amazing time together. She was the best travel buddy ever.

I was lucky that I was in a study abroad program that guided me, but I want to be able to have experiences like that again when I’m on my own, and I want you to be able to have them too.

Nowadays it's easy to book flights, find hotels, and look up what to see on TripAdvisor. But it's still incredibly hard to actually connect with a place and its people in a meaningful way. You show up, follow the tourist guidebook, take the photos, and leave feeling like you barely scratched the surface. You saw everything but experienced nothing.

What I'm always searching for—and maybe you are too:

* **Real local life.** The cafés where people get their morning coffee, the parks where families hang out on weekends. Places that locals actually go to, to see the way they actually live. Be around people who show me around their hidden favorite spots.
* **Someone who travels the way I do**. Who cares about the same things I care about. Who wants to spend hours getting lost in used bookstores and local libraries. Who's down to hunt for the best street food at 11pm. Who gets genuinely excited about a random historical plaque or a jazz bar tucked down an alley.
* **That perfect travel companion energy.** You know that feeling when you meet someone and just click? When you can walk around a city for hours without it feeling awkward, or sit in comfortable silence watching the sunset, or suddenly decide to chase down a street festival you just heard about?

But how do you find these people and places? Right now, you can't. So you compromise. You go alone and deal with the loneliness, or you join some overpriced cookie-cutter tour where everything is planned down to the minute and you never get to deviate from the script.

Neither option gives you what travel should be about: genuine connection and authentic discovery.

That's why I'm building Nomigo.

First, it connects you with travelers and locals who actually match your interests, your pace, your curiosity. People you'd actually want to spend time with.

Then it uses AI to build itineraries around local spots that align with what you care about. Not ""top 10 must-sees"" but the jazz clubs locals love, the markets where people actually shop, the galleries people enjoy. All the hidden spots that make a city special to the people who live there.

Next time you travel, I want you to be able to experience your own version of Tokyo, Paris, and Rome. Connect with people and places that make those cities come alive. Create your own unforgettable, irreplaceable stories. I want to make travel feel like yours.

In the end, what matters is who you walked all over Rome with. The person you stayed up talking to until sunrise. Coming home with stories about people and moments, not just photos of buildings.

If this sounds like something you've been looking for too, [sign up for early access](https://nomigotravel.com). The app will be released very soon and will be free. You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/JsfaNwP77W) in the meanwhile to connect with other travelers. I may be biased, but I'm in love with this app and I want to help redefine how people travel and experience the world. 

Ok sorry for the long post lol I hope you are as excited as I am!

1oqiwwd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqiwwd,Wife approved acoustic treatments for this space?,"Finished a small refresh project in our basement last year and have been enjoying our setup thus far. Looking now to add some improvements and was wondering if anyone had some tips on some wife-approved/subtle acoustic treatments?

I saw some Amplitude Acoustic Panels on GIK that had some nice designs that I still need to show her. We are handy and can DIY, but I liked the polished look from GIK. I'm thinking one or two panels on the back wall and one on the side wall? I'm not sure if corner bass traps would fly with her. Possibly one in the corner near the hopper window. 

Other than acoustics, improvements we look to make down the road include removing the popcorn ceiling and painting (a real pain), upgrading LR speakers and angling them towards MIP, replacing the coffee table, and knocking down the space under our stairs to add a mini-bar (not pictured). Also, we move the center speaker up to the edge when watching movies. 

Any tips are welcome, thanks!

But anyway, I lived in NYC for 15 years and lived in Washington heights. When I was younger I lived with my bf and his mom for a few years during my rebellious period. I was coming from a small town in MD so I never knew what poverty looked like , especially coming from an upper middle class family. Anyway when I moved in with my Dominican bf and his family. His mom cooked breakfast and dinner for us every night. Her food was delicious, and she somehow made a delicious meal out of nothing. I totally forgot that different cultures and ethnicities have been making meals last since the beginning of time. I decided to go to my local Spanish market and got

I did not get a lot of veggies because I didn’t want them to go bad , so I will pick those up as needed or get some frozen. I tried to look at budget friendly meals with a regular American diet, but a lot of meals required a lot of ingredients that didn’t last too long, so they are hard to stretch. 
Here’s what a few days of my family’s meals will look like 

Thursday - 
Breakfast - two eggs and coffee 
Lunch - 15k steps 
Dinner - Lomo Saltado 

Friday 
Breakfast - eggs , coffee 
Lunch - yogurt with fruit & granola / sandwich 
Dinner - empanadas 

Saturday

Lunch- skip 
Dinner - pot luck / leftovers 

Sunday

I know this seems carb heavy , but my main goal is full bellies. If I can stretch these meals to the next night I will or I will let my husband take them for lunch the next day. My baby is only an infant , so we don’t have a lot of kids snacks. But if you’re a parent who has small kids , pb&j , you make your own potato chips , and French fries , making mini cupcakes from boxed cake mix.  

I can’t really afford to treat myself to my local bakeries coffee , so I’ve learned to make cafe con leche. I had some boxed cake mix in my pantry, that’s been a lifesaver, because we’re human and sometimes we want something sweet. I made a chocolate cake, that we have been eating for dessert the past few nights. I know that right now we are all feeling the effects of not getting our benefits. We Are in wall to wall debt , living on one income, with a 9 month old baby. I say this all to say , is we can do this. Our children don’t need to go hungry , we can make these meals stretch. There are people all around the globe making it work with nothing in comparison to what we all consider a meal. Months ago I went to a Turkish coffee shop and breakfast consisted of eggs , olives , dried fruit , cucumbers and tomatoes with coffee or tea. Check out your local international market , this could be a good time to learn a different cultures food. These meals would take you farther than frozen food from Walmart or costsco could.

The 3 way solenoid failed and it zapped the board.

I followed the famous post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/s4do2t/comment/i0zhabz/](https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/s4do2t/comment/i0zhabz/)

While replacing Q7 I tore a pad off, but the trace appeared to go directly to R62 so I jumped it with solder. 



After putting it all together it appears to be working better than before.

The shot button will send water through the head, which did not happen before.



However, the steam is now hardly working. (video:[ https://youtube.com/shorts/tDte9xDcBqU](https://youtube.com/shorts/tDte9xDcBqU))

After selecting steam it takes about 30 seconds for it to start thumping.

It sputters loudly, sometimes sends out some good jets of steam, then stops for another 30 seconds.

It will also send steam out of the head.



After I turn the mode off of steam, a gush of steam comes out of the head.



I also believe that I can hear a slight pressure leak from the top of the (new) 3 way solenoid.

It sounds like water dripped onto a hot pan, and I only hear it after the steam is turned off.



I have run a vinegar solution through the head/steam wand several times. Lots of white grains came out, that has slowed after all the descales.

The tip of the wand is not clogged.

Machine is at least 5 years old with heavy use.

Sorry for invading your feed, but I’m working on something I care about a lot, and I think some of you might relate as to why.

I studied abroad in Beijing last year for a language immersion program and had an absolute blast. My Chinese friends showed me around all these amazing spots and hidden gems I never would have found on my own. I truly felt like I was living Chinese culture, not just observing it from the outside. It's one thing to visit a place, but to truly experience it is completely another thing.

After my time in China, I did a tour around East Asia with my best friend I made in the program. She had some free time and had very similar travel interests and style as I did (night markets, temples, street food). We had the most amazing time together. She was the best travel buddy ever.

I was lucky that I was in a study abroad program that guided me, but I want to be able to have experiences like that again when I’m on my own, and I want you to be able to have them too.

Nowadays it's easy to book flights, find hotels, and look up what to see on TripAdvisor. But it's still incredibly hard to actually connect with a place and its people in a meaningful way. You show up, follow the tourist guidebook, take the photos, and leave feeling like you barely scratched the surface. You saw everything but experienced nothing.

What I'm always searching for—and maybe you are too:

* **Real local life.** The cafés where people get their morning coffee, the parks where families hang out on weekends. Places that locals actually go to, to see the way they actually live. Be around people who show me around their hidden favorite spots.
* **Someone who travels the way I do**. Who cares about the same things I care about. Who wants to spend hours getting lost in used bookstores and local libraries. Who's down to hunt for the best street food at 11pm. Who gets genuinely excited about a random historical plaque or a jazz bar tucked down an alley.
* **That perfect travel companion energy.** You know that feeling when you meet someone and just click? When you can walk around a city for hours without it feeling awkward, or sit in comfortable silence watching the sunset, or suddenly decide to chase down a street festival you just heard about?

But how do you find these people and places? Right now, you can't. So you compromise. You go alone and deal with the loneliness, or you join some overpriced cookie-cutter tour where everything is planned down to the minute and you never get to deviate from the script.

Neither option gives you what travel should be about: genuine connection and authentic discovery.

That's why I'm building Nomigo.

First, it connects you with travelers and locals who actually match your interests, your pace, your curiosity. People you'd actually want to spend time with.

Then it uses AI to build itineraries around local spots that align with what you care about. Not ""top 10 must-sees"" but the jazz clubs locals love, the markets where people actually shop, the galleries people enjoy. All the hidden spots that make a city special to the people who live there.

Next time you travel, I want you to be able to experience your own version of Tokyo, Paris, and Rome. Connect with people and places that make those cities come alive. Create your own unforgettable, irreplaceable stories. I want to make travel feel like yours.

In the end, what matters is who you walked all over Rome with. The person you stayed up talking to until sunrise. Coming home with stories about people and moments, not just photos of buildings.

If this sounds like something you've been looking for too, [sign up for early access](https://nomigotravel.com). The app will be released very soon and will be free. You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/JsfaNwP77W) in the meanwhile to connect with other travelers. I may be biased, but I'm in love with this app and I want to help redefine how people travel and experience the world. 

Ok sorry for the long post lol I really hope you are as excited as I am!

I kept meaning to come back to it but it never seemed needed (I mean, I was actually doing the work already)! After getting laid off in August of this year, I finally decided it was time to finish what I started: I’m proud to share that I passed the PMP Above Target in all domains yesterday!

**My Background**

I’ve never held the official title of Project Manager, but I’ve spent 10+ years of unofficial (Agile) technical project experience in SaaS. This certification is ""idealistically PMI"" and not really reality. What I take from this is that I know Agile, so that came easy to me, it was the PMI ideal version of Traditional (Predictive) that took a bit to really learn.

**My Study Approach**

* Total study time: \~1.5 months
* Schedule: 1–5 hours per weekday, occasionally weekends

**Main resources I used from recommendations here and beyond (THANK YOU, I REALLY HAD NO DIRECTION UNTIL I FOUND THIS SUB!):**

* AR’s PMP Prep Udemy course (35h required hours)
   * If you buy his book, you get the course FREE (directly on his TIA website, don't be like me and do the Udemy course AND buy the book... I didn't really use the book once I got Study Hall).
* AR's “How to CORRECTLY Complete the PMP Application in Under 5 Minutes with AI” on YouTube
   * Seriously, start here! Do not wait until you're done with the 35h course to dive into this. Here's the [Google Sheets workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uKZZ5euGzJGLk8pOjXQtoA-S_MLO-qZlp_4vUizALag/edit?usp=sharing) I made to brainstorm and identify the projects I used for the application.
* AR’s “Complete PMP Mindset 50 Principles and Questions” on YouTube
   * I watched this and got 95% of the associated mindset questions correct, so this is just good at validating after you've already done the 35h course!
* PMI Study Hall (Essentials version, which only has 2 full-length exams)
   * This renews quarterly, so don't subscribe until you're in the ""final stretch!
   * Do the mini quizzes and games first. Then do full-length exams (Do ALL the mini-exams BEFORE the full-length exams to get the best value/test of your abilities. Doing it this way, I didn't feel the need to have any more than 2 full-length exams.)
   * I skipped the Study Hall Learning Path entirely.
* PMI's PMP Exam Prep Mobile App (iPhone)
   * Treat this like Study Hall, only get when you're in the ""final stretch"" or within 3 months of your exam. This was great to take a daily quiz on-the-go, but does cost, so you can do without if you're always able to get on your computer for Study Hall.
   * I took a quiz every day or every other day, I think this gave me exposure to more questions, which is helpful for the exam (exposure to questions).
* PMAspirant's Drag & Drop Simulator questions
   * Nice practice for studying AND practice for any D&Ds you have (I only had 1).
* Third3Rock Notes + Cheat Sheet
   * This was good to re-explain the foundational knowledge in another way to help solidify understanding.
* DM’s ""The PMP Cheat Sheet - How to Tell if You're ready for the PMP Exam"" on YouTube
   * Last minute confidence booster and reminder! Covers more things I actually saw on the exam, which helped bring those to the forefront of my mind before sitting.

Aside: I have an ITIL Foundations cert, but I wouldn’t say it helped much beyond process familiarity.

**My Exam Experience**

* Prep: Went to bed at 7PM the night before, asleep by 8:00. Exam at 8:00AM, 30-minute drive to testing center, woke up at 5:00AM, ate breakfast, had coffee, took my time to ensure there was ZERO stress.
* Location: In-person at Pearson VUE *(my first in-person exam, will do this again. Arrived at the center 45 minutes before my exam, got to start my exam 15 minutes early.)*
* Format: 180 questions, 2 breaks
* Time: Finished with 13 minutes to spare
* Breaks: TAKE THEM. They reset your brain.
* No math or ITTOs — it was all situational, and mindset-focused, one drag and drop.
* Lots of Agile/Hybrid team questions, leadership scenarios, and emotional intelligence.
* The white background was harsh on the eyes, but worse was the guy coughing nonstop in the testing room. 😅 (Earplugs and noise-canceling didn’t help.)

**What Worked (and What Didn’t)**

* ✅ **Mindset** is everything. Understanding the PMI approach helped me eliminate AT LEAST 1, but typically 2–3 wrong answers easily!
* ✅ I tried, but ultimately skipped the formula memorization. Just know: <1 = bad, >1 = good
* ✅ Don’t *overstudy* ITTOs. I didn’t see any questions like “which process creates what doc”
* ✅ Use Study Hall full-length exams AFTER mini-exams, if you’re hitting 70%+, you’re very likely ready
* ✅ Schedule as soon as our application is approved and DO NOT reschedule. You’ll only build unnecessary doubt!

**Final Thoughts**

If you’ve put your PMP on pause like I did six years ago, don’t beat yourself up. The timing just has to align, and when it does, it’s worth every bit of effort! It's done!

He was completely destroyed.


So he married me—not out of love, but revenge.


He took my everything. My business. My family. My future.


He broke me down until I couldn't take it anymore.


Until I jumped.


Right before I died, Vaughn stood there, cold as ice, and covered my eyes with his hand.


""Josie, if there's a next life... stay away from me and Piper. Just stay away.""


When I opened my eyes, I was seventeen again.


Same path to Lincoln High I'd walked a thousand times.


Down the street, Vaughn and Piper were heading my way.


Piper spotted me first and waved like crazy.


""Josie! Over here!""


I froze.


This time? Of course I'm staying the HELL away from both of them.


So I grabbed my backpack, hurled it straight at them, and RAN.


---


""Josie! Hey! What's going on? We're gonna be late!""


I didn't stop. Just kept running against the crowd of students in their uniforms.


The wind hit my face, warm and real.


God, it felt good.


Being alive felt so damn good.


All that darkness from before—the kind that gets inside me and won't let go, the kind that makes me want to die—it was gone.


Right now, I was just seventeen-year-old Josie Hartwell.


Healthy. Happy. Alive.


The Hartwells and Castellanos went way back. Vaughn was a year older than me, and he'd always looked out for me growing up.


Candy when we were kids.


Pretty dresses when we got older.


A sapphire necklace for my sixteenth birthday…


He'd been good to me for as long as I could remember.


Plenty of girls wanted him, but I was the one by his side.


He was like a brother. But somewhere along the way, he also became the guy I secretly loved.


Until freshman year happened—


I passed out during the sports meet, and Piper Ashford took me to the nurse.


After that, there were three of us instead of two.


Vaughn and Piper had everything in common—same interests, both straight-A students, always talking about something I couldn't keep up with.


I slowly became the third wheel tagging along.


...


In my last life, the rumors that Piper's stepdad raped her spread through the whole school.


Before she jumped, her hair was a mess and she stared at me with pure hate.


""Josie Hartwell, remember this—YOU killed me!""


Then she jumped. Didn't hesitate. Didn't give anyone time to stop her.


Didn't even give me a chance to explain.


When Vaughn saw the note she left, he lost it.


His fingers dug into my shoulders so hard I thought my bones would break. His eyes were bloodshot, filled with this hatred that scared the hell out of me.


""Josie! Why? Why would you do this?""


""You're the only one who knew!""


""I..."" My throat felt like sandpaper. I could barely get the words out through the pain.


""It wasn't me.""


""I didn't do it.""


But nobody believed me.


Piper accused me in front of everyone before she died.


That was it. I was guilty.


Any defense I tried just sounded pathetic next to a dead girl's final words.


So I got bullied. Isolated.


Everyone looked at me like I was a murderer. Every single person at school had it out for me.


Especially Vaughn.


Four years later, the Castellanos wanted to merge with my family. Vaughn agreed to marry me.


It was like Piper never existed. He went back to treating me the way he used to—sweet, caring, perfect.


I thought maybe Vaughn finally believed me.


He ruffled my hair the way he'd done since we were kids, his face soft and warm.


""Josie, let's get married.""


I remembered Vaughn being like this—gentle, protective. I thought the old Vaughn was back.


Until he got his hands on the Ashford family's private files.


Until he destroyed my family's business piece by piece.


Until my parents got kicked out of Seattle and I was trapped in that house.


Hatred. Silent treatment. That's all I got, every single day.


Vaughn stopped pretending. When he looked at me, his eyes were empty and cold.


""Josie, everything Piper went through? You're gonna go through it too.""


""Why don't you just die? Maybe then... maybe I could finally forgive you.""


So seven years later, I did exactly what Vaughn wanted. I jumped, just like Piper did.


...


I stood there on the sidewalk, the school bell still ringing in my ears.


The feeling of my skull cracking open, my soul being ripped out, Vaughn's cold voice in those final seconds—all of it slowly faded from my mind.


""Josie, if there's a next time... stay the hell away from us.""


I let out a long breath.


This time, I'm staying far away from Vaughn Castellano and Piper Ashford. Both of them.


Then I turned and ran home as fast as I could.


Chapter 2


""Josie? Shouldn't you be in class right now?""


The second I burst through the door, Mom was in the backyard with her coffee, looking totally relaxed. She seemed surprised to see me.


My eyes got hot and I threw myself at her, holding on tight.


In my last life, they lost everything. Vaughn—the kid they'd watched grow up—forced them out of Seattle. I didn't even get to say goodbye before I died.


""You're still so clingy. What are you gonna do when you get married someday?""


Mom's voice was gentle and teasing above my head.


But the word ""married"" made me flinch.


I held her tighter.


""I'm not getting married. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here with you and Dad, helping with the company, being a spoiled rich kid who does absolutely nothing...""


Mom pretended to be annoyed, but she was smiling.


""Well then, I guess we'll just have to let you mooch off us forever.""


...


I spent the whole evening pulling myself together.


The next day, I went back to school. The driver dropped me off at the gates.


As I got out, I caught a glimpse of Vaughn and Piper at the corner, laughing about something.


That was our usual spot. They were waiting for me.


Terrified they'd see me, I ducked my head, grabbed my backpack, and rushed into school.


That path. The three of us walking together. I'd always watch Vaughn, but Vaughn only ever watched Piper.


This crush should've ended a long time ago.


But back then, young and stupid, I was just happy to steal one more look at Vaughn on that stupid path.


After school, I dragged my feet leaving. Vaughn and Piper were still waiting at the gate.


No way around them. I had to walk out.


Piper didn't ask why I ran yesterday. She just linked her arm through mine like always, warm and familiar.


""Josie! We waited like forever. What happened?""


I tried to hold it together, but I couldn't help it—I pulled my hand away.


Piper's face froze for a second before she recovered.


""It's my birthday today. You're coming, right?""


My heart dropped.


In my last life, Piper's birthday was when she got drunk and we talked about everything. That's when she told me about her stepdad—that he raped her when she was younger.


How could I risk hearing her secrets again?


I didn't dare look at Vaughn standing next to her. Just kept my head down, stumbling over my words.


""I... I can't. Family stuff. Happy birthday though.""


With that, I turned and walked away fast, ignoring Piper's eyes turning red behind me.


Suddenly I heard footsteps behind me.


""Josie.""


Vaughn.


My heart jumped. I kept my head down and walked faster.


Vaughn caught up in like three steps and blocked my path. His shadow fell over me completely.


""Why are you running?""


Finally, I looked up at eighteen-year-old Vaughn.


He wore the familiar uniform. His face was sharp and handsome. But his eyes had this depth, this coldness that didn't match his age—exactly like the Vaughn from my last life.


Wait.


Eighteen-year-old Vaughn would never look at me like this.


Panic hit me hard. I stumbled backward, almost losing my balance.


Vaughn stepped closer, literally standing on my shadow.


""Josie, you're scared of me, aren't you?""


Chapter 3


The next second, Vaughn's face softened. He reached out and ruffled my hair like he used to.


""Josie, are you okay? Why are you avoiding me and Piper?""


""It's Piper's birthday. She'll be really upset if you don't come. Let's go celebrate together, yeah?""


Vaughn was smiling, but I could feel him testing me.


Made sense.


Since yesterday, I'd been acting completely different, avoiding them whenever I could, not hanging on Vaughn's every word like I used to in my last life.


If Vaughn wasn't actually eighteen-year-old Vaughn, he'd definitely suspect I wasn't seventeen-year-old Josie either.


After three years of marriage, whatever I'd felt for Vaughn died along with everything else he put me through.


Now? I hate him. And I'm scared as hell of him.


""I... I...""


I forced a smile, but Vaughn had already turned to the driver waiting by the curb. ""Hey Marcus, friend's birthday. I'll drop Josie off later.""


Marcus knew our families were close. He nodded and drove off.


I had no choice but to follow them.


Back when the three of us used to hang out, I'd mostly just watch Vaughn and Piper talk and laugh with perfect chemistry while my heart twisted with jealousy.


But now? I just watched them blankly, feeling nothing.


Actually, I was trying to figure out what excuse I could use to leave early.


...


The night before I jumped in my last life was the anniversary of Piper's death.


Vaughn, who usually stayed out partying, came home for once. He smiled at me—that gentle smile—while he destroyed me.


""Josie, remember senior year? When those kids cornered you in that alley? I was there that day. I stood at the entrance... and I watched.""


The window reflected my face going white.


That day. I'll never forget that day.


Several students trapped me in the alley behind Lincoln High. They called me a murderer. They took turns slapping me. They ripped up all my books and threw the pieces everywhere.


Then they made me post a video on Instagram saying ""I'm sorry, Piper"" over and over while they filmed.


I did what they wanted because that was the only way to make it stop.


On graduation day, I thought it was finally over. I tried so hard to forget those awful memories, to bury everything about Piper.


I thought I could start over.


But seven years later, Vaughn told me that on that day—that horrible, humiliating day—he was there. He'd been there the whole time.


Vaughn, who'd held my hand since we were kids, who'd been like a brother watching me grow up—he stood there and watched me get beaten, cursed at, humiliated.


And he did nothing.


Vaughn leaned down and whispered in my ear.


""Oh, and Josie. Your mom's sick—can't even afford her medication. And your dad? He's out there working construction. At his age. Threw out his back last month.""


""That's all you, Josie. They could've been comfortable forever. But now they're paying for what you did.""


I watched my own eyes go dead in that window with every word he said.


Turns out, as long as I was alive, as long as Vaughn was in my life, nothing could ever end.


I could only escape through death.


On the way to the party, Vaughn called the manager at his family's club and had them clear out a private room.


Listening to his voice—calm, in control, like he owned the place—I suddenly thought of Vaughn after we got married.


This was how he sounded after taking over the family business.


Had he been reborn too?


The thought made me nervous.


No matter what, I couldn't let Vaughn figure out I was different.


If Vaughn really had been reborn, and if everything from my last life happened again, I'd still be the one who hurt Piper in his eyes.


After all, I was the ONLY one who knew Piper's secret.


In the private room, Piper picked a love song and asked Vaughn to sing it with her, all shy and cute.


Everyone immediately started teasing them.


In their eyes, Vaughn and Piper were basically together already—they just hadn't made it official yet.


I watched it all. Just felt the whole birthday thing was boring and endless.


Suddenly the door opened. A woman in an expensive suit walked in.",1,1762482187.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False
1oqifap,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaiserPermanente/comments/1oqifap/inappropriate_interaction_with_np/,Inappropriate interaction with NP,"Just wanted to share what I went through a couple days ago and asking for practical advice.

I came in on a Monday for a Treadmill Stress Test at the Cardiology office. I got a referral from a previous urgent care visit for chest pain. The test was administered by a **nurse practictioner** and an assistant (not sure if she was an RN? she most likely was ,idk).. anyways, I did the test and was having small talk with the nurse practitioner throughout my appointment. 

Hours later that same day, I receive a call and the caller ID was Kaiser. I answered and it was the **nurse practitioner** who had administered the test with me earlier. At the start of the call, he told me that he was calling to follow up with how I was feeling about the test. He stated ""*you seemed unsure about the test results at the end of your appointment earlier*"" (we had discussed my treadmill test before I left the office). TLDR- he told me that my EKG was abnormal during my appointment but that it wasn't a bad thing, just that I had to go back to my PCP to explore more deeply into why I've been having chest pain. (which has already been a frustrating journey for me already..)

**ANYWHO**,, Throughout the call, he was reassurring me that it is okay to have abnormal EKG. **This is when it started getting weird**. As I was thanking him for the reassurance and trying to end the call, the nurse practitioner says ""*I don't mean to put you in an awkward position, but I thought you were kind and seemed nice. Would you wanna go out for some coffee?*"" I was taken aback!!! I was shocked I had never experienced something like this. I abruptly responded ""*No. I'm not interested*."" And he said something along the lines of, ""*Sorry, I guess I was overreading how you were acting towards me earlier.*"" I WAS LIVID AND FELT SO UNCOMFORTABLE. I hung up feeling very confused, shaking. I already had a weird gut feeling when I picked up the call because I've done multiple tests (ultrasounds, x-rays) and not once has Kaiser called me the same day of the test to ask how I was feeling. I found that strange way before the dude literally tried asking me out. ***MIND YOU***!!! He has a wife and a kid. He was literally talking to me about his wife and kid during our appointment.

It's been almost 3 days since this happened and it is still running in my mind. I've been hesitant on filing a grievance form about this, simply because of figuring out whether or not it's worth my time. Was this inappropriate?? Realistically, what would happen if I report this incident?  ",3,1762482148.0,KaiserPermanente,6,0.71,False
1oqidzq,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1oqidzq/laptop_keyboard_stopped_working_after_windows_11/,Laptop Keyboard Stopped Working After Windows 11 Update? Here’s the fix!,"I’ve been hearing about lots of people having keyboard issues after a windows update. No hardware damage, no coffee spills, just randomly stopped working. It turns out that this is a worldwide issue caused by the most recent Windows 11 25H2 update. I don’t exactly remember the details, just that it is related to the boot and hibernation settings.

Thankfully, this is an easy fix. Hook up an external keyboard to your laptop, or use the windows on screen keyboard. Open up a command prompt (search CMD in taskbar search) and click “run as administrator.” Once that opens, type in the following command:

powercfg.exe /hibernate off

Press enter, and restart the computer. This should fix the issue!

TL;DR: A recent windows update is causing laptop keyboard issues. It’s related to hibernation settings, and the computer not booting the keyboard drivers properly. Enter the command above into a command prompt ran as administrator, then restart the computer.",1,1762482040.0,techsupport,11,0.67,False
1oqidq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1oqidq9/20251106_when_i_get_bitchy/,2025/11/06 when i get bitchy,"there was a point in time where i'd wake up to like 20 notifications across social media (at the time, for me, it was mostly here on reddit, facebook and youtube).  i'd have been all bitchy and worked up the night before, maybe up on my high horse about things, and then i'd wake up and start the day with this negativity.  

it's not so much like that now, but i do still wake up sometimes and think 'ugh' about some of the things i said the night before.  bitch sessions, i do have them.  bitter, superior moments, getting full of myself, all that.  the later it gets, the more willing i am to be an asshole and say things i regret. 

i had a best friend growing up who was a genuinely good friend and person.  i still remember asking her, point blank, in grade one if she'd be my best friend and i still remember her response: 'sure, if no one else asks me'  and that was good enough for me because nobody seemed to have as direct an approach as i did and asked her in plain terms to be their best friend.  anyway, one of the things that made her so classy to me was how she was always the first to apologize, and genuinely, even if whatever had happened wasn't her fault.  i'm still impressed to this day at just how mature that is for a little kid, because a lot of adults don't even have that.

i try to be that way when it actually counts, but a lot of the time, when i know i've been bitchy, i won't apologize even if it's my fault.  getting upset and vindictive, for me, is one of the joys of life and i know not to carry it with me afterwards.  that doesn't always mean taking it back.  most of the time, i can't be bothered with it though because i think i'm running out of complaints to cover and arguments to have.  the longer this goes on and the more i tire myself out, the less combative i am, which is great because i don't like being that way.

i went grocery shopping today and got a ton of eggs. eggs are a noncommunal item here so, i need them.  one of the first times i lived away from home was with a bunch of hippy types and they shared a lot of stuff that i took advantage of (i was a horrible roommate for years).  one of those things was eggs and i had so much nerve and entitlement about taking them.  they had a habit of putting the shell of the egg back in the carton and i told them not to because it made me think there were more eggs than there actually were.  these were *their* eggs.  i was such a bitch.  this is an occasion, though, where i know i was a bitch but i still wouldn't apologize because they were also sort of assholes in their own way.  i got more out of our living arrangement than they did, but only because i was better at taking advantage of it.  other roommates later down the line, yes, i would apologize to them.  i never did anything so terrible that it's a pressing issue to apologize, but if i ran into them somehow, i'd try to make some sort of amends. 

this morning for [breakfast](https://imgur.com/p7epXOt) i had a bran muffin (SO good, recipe on the back of the wheat bran bag), an apple, yogurt and coffee.  [lunch](https://imgur.com/ZLx6U83) was finally the last of the cauliflower curry and a naan bread then [jello](https://imgur.com/dF3mO71) and yogurt.  [coffee](https://imgur.com/NJwxoFy) later and [dinner](https://imgur.com/ervqwGz) was two hamburgers because i was hungry.  last thing was a [hot chocolate](https://imgur.com/oOex34A), which, along with my coffee, i don't make decadent.

1oqid0t,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1oqid0t/constant_heart_palpitations/,Constant Heart Palpitations,"Female, 20, 5ft, 126 pounds. For the past week or so I have had frequent heart palpitations, lightheadedness, short of breath (although not as frequently as the other two). I didn't have reasons to worry until recently since I thought this could just be anxiety/lack of sleep, which I am quite used to. However, a couple of days ago, I had experienced a sleep paralysis and felt my heartbeat increase a lot, which I thought was odd considering I had never experienced a sudden rise in my heartbeat whilst having sleep paralysis previously. I have experienced sudden rises in my heartbeat before and usually could find stress or caffeine to blame, but recently I've been feeling extremely restless, with constant heart palpitations without drinking any coffee, smoking, and even with good sleep. I am also not taking any medicine. The lightheadedness is annoying, but not bad enough to the point I can't carry out with my day, although I feel a lot more tired and have to take things slower than I'm used to, I've also been finding myself just wanting to lay down at any chance I've got. The shortness of breath is much more infrequent and I usually only experience it later in the day, around evening, and it feels like the start of an anxiety attack that just prolongs itself but never actually starts, and I'm just left in that stage of anticipation, that's the best way I could describe how I feel i think. I have also been eating and drinking water as I usually do, but last sunday I ended up vomiting (which I am not prone to) and it seemed like there was a very small red part, not enough to concern me the  since I thought it could be from the plums I had that day, I also asked my mothet and she didn't think it was blood either. It only came to my mind when I had the sleep paralysis and I thought they could be symptons of the same thing. Now, I don't consume caffeine or smoke frequently, and I also don't take any other substances. However, I do have an awful sleeping schedule and sudden spurts of small anxiety attacks, however, neither of those have ever made me feel as restless as I feel now, whilst also just wanting to lie down all the time. And even when I'm laying down I find it difficult to fall asleep due to the lightheadedness. I have also done blood tests a few months ago, and besides a lack of folic acid (which I now take vitaminds for), they came out just fine. 

I have been trying to just wait the last few days to see if my body would just calm itself down from build-up stress, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Should I be concerned over this or it's just common for heart palpitations to be this obnoxious? ",1,1762481962.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1oqiayg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1oqiayg/is_ai_reducing_our_critical_thinking_skills/,Is AI reducing our critical thinking skills?,"[](https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/?f=flair_name%3A%22Question%22)

# AI has transformed how we work, study, and solve problems and mostly for the better. But there's a trade-off we don't talk about enough. When AI can answer any question, write any email, or solve any problem in seconds, what happens to our own thinking muscles? As a student, I've noticed something: I feel sharper when I struggle with problems, and duller when I outsource them. It's like having a calculator for every mental task convenient but potentially weakening. I'm curious if others feel this too whether you're a professional, student, or just someone navigating the AI era. Would you mind answering a few quick questions below? I'm gathering perspectives to understand if this is a real phenomenon or just in my head...

**1. Do you ever feel like AI/tech is making you think less deeply?**

**2. How often do you use AI tools for work or study?**

* Multiple times daily
* Daily
* Few times a week
* Rarely/Never

**3. When you use AI, do you critically evaluate its output or mostly trust it?**

* Always evaluate carefully
* Usually evaluate
* Sometimes evaluate
* Mostly just trust it

**4. Which of these cognitive skills do you MOST wish you were better at?**

* Spotting biases and flawed reasoning
* Analyzing complex arguments
* Creative problem-solving under pressure
* Making decisions with incomplete information
* Thinking independently (not just echoing others)
* Other: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**5. Would you take time out of your day to genuinely and practical improve your brain.**

**6. What could you do to improve your brains critical thinking, and general brain power?**

**7. When in the day would you want to train your brain?**

* Morning routine (coffee + mental warmup)
* Commute/transit time
* Lunch break
* Before bed
* Wouldn't use it regularly

**8. Biggest concern about consistently training your brain?**

* Would feel like homework
* Would get boring fast
* Don't trust the quality
* Too time-consuming",0,1762481798.0,Futurology,18,0.41,False

1oqi1vq,https://i.redd.it/vqzo65h6tqzf1.jpeg,Curtis Woodman’s Wayfinder Premiers at Del Oro Thursday Nov 20th - seating opens at 7pm,"Curtis Woodman is debuting his latest DIY snowboarding film ""Wayfinder"" Thursday Nov 20th at the Del Oro Theatre in Downtown Grass Valley.  Curtis will give a short talk before the film and will be available to sign autographs and take pictures after the fillm. We will be celebrating Curtis' Birthday, with FREE COPIES of Slush Mag and a product toss from his favorite sponsors!  Seating opens at 7pm.  

Wayfinder is a breathtaking snowboarding odyssey set in the rugged, untouched backcountry of Lake Tahoe, showcasing the raw talent and creative vision of professional snowboarder Curtis Woodman. Self-filmed using cutting-edge drone technology, Woodman captures every heart-pounding descent and stylish maneuver with unparalleled intimacy, immersing viewers in the pristine beauty of the Sierra Nevada’s powder-laden peaks, steep chutes, and dramatic cornices. Beyond the stunning visuals, Wayfinder is a deeply personal journey of self-discovery and resilience, reflecting Woodman’s reconnection with snowboarding finding his way through whatever life throws at him. As the film’s editor, producer, and even the voice behind its original soundtrack, Woodman weaves a soulful narrative that blends adrenaline-fueled action with introspective storytelling. The song, performed by Woodman himself, serves as a soul searching odyssey, infusing the film with emotional depth. Wayfinder is more than a snowboarding film—it’s a testament to finding one’s path through passion, nature, and perseverance.

I’m 49, newly settling into Chicago, caramel-skinned, curvy in the places that count, soft-hearted, thoughtful, and a little introverted until I feel safe enough to unfold. I love live music, art museums, cozy mornings with coffee, exploring neighborhoods and tucked-away gems, and laughing over small joys. I’m a tattoo collector, a feel-the-song-in-my-bones kind of woman, and someone who treasures emotional intimacy just as much as the physical — maybe even more.

I’m looking for a man who is steady, emotionally present, values kindness, and actually wants to build something lasting. Ideally 45–50, professional, more extroverted than me, grounded, and ready to meet someone where they are and grow from there. Someone who naturally reaches for the small of my back when we cross the street, who wants to explore this city with me — from museums to rooftop views to hidden coffee shops — and who loves a good concert night just as much as a cozy night in.

If we connect, I’d love to hear your voice, not just your texts — real conversations matter to me.

If you reach out, please send:
• Your age
• Your location (Chicago or close by)
• A little about you + what you're looking for
• A recent photo (Imgur works great — attraction matters both ways)

No games. No rushing. Just two people seeing if the spark feels like something worth leaning toward.

I'm 33, NB (AMAB), located in Toronto Canada. I have an androgynous appearance normally. I'm searching for someone who shares my values and outlook on life. If you're also NB that would be awesome (AMAB or AFAB), but I'm open to connecting with others too. I find joy in the little things in life, often getting lost in the small, overlooked details that make everything special.

Creativity is a big part of who I am. I love listening to and also making music (I play piano and guitar) and I’m currently taking pottery classes 2 times a month. I'm also quite spiritual, appreciating the connection to nature and the deeper aspects of humanity without following any particular religion. Inclusivity, respect for everyone and being open minded are extremely important to me.  
  
I’m looking for a long-term connection with someone who’s ready to take things slow. Let chat a bit, exchange photos once we're both comfortable and maybe enjoy a coffee or drink together soon after in a safe space!

If that sounds like something you're up for, feel free to reach out. I’ve got a photo on my profile to give you a rough idea of what I look like. I'm happy to share a full photo in private once we're both comfortable. Looking forward to hearing from you!",1,1762480766.0,r4r,1,0.67,False

1oqhuds,https://www.reddit.com/r/wanderlust/comments/1oqhuds/my_chinese_friends_made_my_study_abroad/,My Chinese friends made my study abroad unforgettable. I'm building an app so you can find your travel people too.,"Hey Reddit, I’m Ellie (21F). Sorry for invading your feed, but I’m working on something I care about a lot, and I think some of you might relate as to why.

I studied abroad in Beijing last year for a language immersion program and had an absolute blast. My Chinese friends showed me around all these amazing spots and hidden gems I never would have found on my own. I truly felt like I was living Chinese culture, not just observing it from the outside. It's one thing to visit a place, but to truly experience it is completely another thing.

After my time in China, I did a tour around East Asia with my best friend I made in the program. She had some free time and had very similar travel interests and style as I did (night markets, temples, street food). We had the most amazing time together. She was the best travel buddy ever.

I was lucky that I was in a study abroad program that guided me, but I want to be able to have experiences like that again when I’m on my own, and I want you to be able to have them too.

Nowadays it's easy to book flights, find hotels, and look up what to see on TripAdvisor. But it's still incredibly hard to actually connect with a place and its people in a meaningful way. You show up, follow the tourist guidebook, take the photos, and leave feeling like you barely scratched the surface. You saw everything but experienced nothing.

What I'm always searching for—and maybe you are too:

* **Real local life.** The cafés where people get their morning coffee, the parks where families hang out on weekends. Places that locals actually go to, to see the way they actually live. Be around people who show me around their hidden favorite spots.
* **Someone who travels the way I do**. Who cares about the same things I care about. Who wants to spend hours getting lost in used bookstores and local libraries. Who's down to hunt for the best street food at 11pm. Who gets genuinely excited about a random historical plaque or a jazz bar tucked down an alley.
* **That perfect travel companion energy.** You know that feeling when you meet someone and just click? When you can walk around a city for hours without it feeling awkward, or sit in comfortable silence watching the sunset, or suddenly decide to chase down a street festival you just heard about?

But how do you find these people and places? Right now, you can't. So you compromise. You go alone and deal with the loneliness, or you join some overpriced cookie-cutter tour where everything is planned down to the minute and you never get to deviate from the script.

Neither option gives you what travel should be about: genuine connection and authentic discovery.

That's why I'm building Nomigo.

First, it connects you with travelers and locals who actually match your interests, your pace, your curiosity. People you'd actually want to spend time with.

Then it uses AI to build itineraries around local spots that align with what you care about. Not ""top 10 must-sees"" but the jazz clubs locals love, the markets where people actually shop, the galleries people enjoy. All the hidden spots that make a city special to the people who live there.

Next time you travel, I want you to be able to experience your own version of Tokyo, Paris, and Rome. Connect with people and places that make those cities come alive. Create your own unforgettable, irreplaceable stories. I want to make travel feel like yours.

In the end, what matters is who you walked all over Rome with. The person you stayed up talking to until sunrise. Coming home with stories about people and moments, not just photos of buildings.

If this sounds like something you've been looking for too, [sign up for early access](https://nomigotravel.com). The app will be released very soon and will be free. You can also join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/JsfaNwP77W) in the meanwhile to connect with other travelers. I may be biased, but I'm in love with this app and I want to help redefine how people travel and experience the world. 

Ok sorry for the long post lol I really hope you are as excited as I am!

The thing was going crazy out there, so I offered to go deal with it and start making coffee. She just rolls over and stares at the wall. Won't even look at me.

I can tell something's off, so I ask her what's going on.

She sits up, crosses her arms, and tells me I hooked up with her coworker in her dream last night. She's genuinely upset about it. Full-on silent treatment for something that happened in her own head while she was asleep. I didn't even know this coworker existed until she mentioned her name just now.

I tried talking to her about it, but she got up, slammed the bathroom door, and now I'm sitting here with this confused cat staring at me.

Unrelated, pressing the power button on the PC case instantly shuts off the computer. (Normal behavior: I have to press the button for a few seconds to shut off the computer.)

Here's what I tried:

1. Swapped out the HDMI cable from the current cable to a different cable.  
2. Swapped out the monitor I'm currently using to a different monitor.  
3. Changed the connection between the monitor and the video card from DP to HDMI.  
4. Changed the connection between the monitor and the PC to connect to the motherboard's HDMI output.

In each of the four testing scenarios I tried, the monitor did not display video output from the PC. Since I have tried isolating the power cable, the display cable, and the physical monitor with no effect, I believe that the problem exists somewhere inside the PC.

This computer is roughly seven years old. I've had no problems with it otherwise.

**Question:** Is there anything I can do to troubleshoot this further?

1oqhirr,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1oqhirr/a_walk_through_the_birch_trees/,A Walk Through the Birch Trees,"I am a hunter. I like spending time in the woods. Being outside, smelling the fresh, crisp air of hunting season in Canada has grown to be my favourite time of year. Every year, I look forward to being out in the fields and woods taking a break from the city.

Hunting is something I learned from my uncle who grew up hunting and trapping throughout his youth. It is a passion he passed down to me. When I was 15 years old he taught me how to hunt, track, gut, skin, and butcher large game. It is a process that connects you to your food, the land, and nature.

It is something I truly love and something that when my friend Talon said “Hey I’d be interested in hunting, could you show me the ropes?” I grinned so big I could’ve put the Cheshire Cat to shame. There were many years where we hunted the same property together and I showed him what my uncle had taught me, what I had learned, and we learned new things together over the years. We both looked forward to hunting season each year... but now, after what happened this season, I don't know if either of us will ever step foot in the woods again.

The property we usually hunted on was a farmers land that we both knew and they were happy to let us on each season. We had heard of a new spot another hour and a half from the farmers field, a spot on Crown Land. Crown Land for those who don't know is simply land that is owned by the Government of Canada. Although a ways out, as the farmers land we hunted was already an hour from the city we lived, we figured we would give this new spot a chance. We made the decision as it was rumored there were some big white-tail bucks in that area, possibly trophy status big. Talon and I always hunted for the freezer; which is to say the antlers on the deer were not the deciding factor in taking the animal. We wanted a full freezer to feed our families, plain and simple. However something about this tale of these prize deer got under our skin. Come to think of it, I'm not even sure where we heard about this place. A friend of a friend whose uncle's brother knew about it, that sort of thing. Now that I am sitting here typing this out, I cannot recall where we heard of this spot. I asked Talon about it and he doesn't remember either.

It was a hunting morning like any other. I woke up and wiped my weary eyes staring at the alarm clock that read Nov. 28th/2024, 4:15 am. I texted Talon that I was up and getting things ready. He simply sent me a thumbs up. I gathered all my gear together, packed some snacks, jerky, peanuts, and a thermos of coffee. Then I double checked I had my licences, ammunition and of course, my rifle. I crept back into my room to kiss my wife on the forehead and said a soft “Love you, bye”. She barely even flinched, just continued her steady soft snoring, content to sleep under her warm blankets and not be going out into the cold late November weather at such an ungodly hour. Normally I wouldn't be getting up quite this early for hunting but with the extra drive and not knowing this new spots landscape Talon and I agreed the earlier, the better.

I picked up Talon at his house, his morning routine I’m sure went very similar to my own. We greeted each other with bags under our eyes, smiles on our faces and we were both sporting the blaze orange jackets and hats that everyone knows so well. We already had a full tank of gas and full coffee mugs so it was time to hit the road.

In November in Central Canada, the weather varies greatly this time of year. Some years, you're sitting in -30C your testicals turning into ice cubes with snow flying directly into your face all the while blazing a trail through three feet of snow. Other times you're out in a cool breeze with a light jacket still feeling the sun on your skin. This year we had a bit of snow on the ground, just enough to leave a solid boot track and the temperature was sitting around -10C. In my opinion, great hunting weather. It wasn't too windy either which was a bonus. Throughout our drive we shot the breeze about our families, work, and what the sneaky politicians in Ontario were cooking up next. All the while a Colter Wall CD played in the background. The highways and gravel roads we took to get there were nothing exciting. A couple of bends here and there, a slow winding highway in the pitch black, only lit up by my truck's old headlights. Then we hit the rumble of the grid road. We were just getting the first formation of light when we pulled up to the spot. The kind of light that can trick your eyes. It can make objects blurry as you strain to get enough light into your retinas to make out whatever it is you're looking at. We pulled up to what felt like a wall of birch trees with a walking path going through them. Not quite wide enough for two guys to walk side by side. I don't know if I had ever seen a birch forest that thick before. Across the distant horizon in the early morning hours, small yellow and white lights dotted across the fields and horizon from farm houses and barns.

I pulled off the gravel road a bit and cut the engine just as Colter was singing the end of his song Bald Butte,  
*“Bald Butte, Bald Butte, so lofty and so high.*  
*Carry me to Bald Butte where the planes wrap ‘round the sky.*

*You can dig a hole on Bald Butte when I die.”*

In the silence with the truck off, and Colter subsequently singing no more, Talon whistled softly and said “That's some tall birch”.

I nodded, neither of us breaking our stare at the forest in front of us.

“Well, this will be an interesting spot to say the least.” I said, hoping that the forest would eventually break open into some open fields that would give us an opportunity to take a shot at a deer. I couldn't even finish my thought when a slight bit of movement caught the corner of my eye. Among the birch it had looked as though something had moved and disappeared in line with the trees. As if a tree being weighed down from snow was finally released and snapped upright, disappearing among its tree counter parts. The problem was it made no sound.

*“Wasn't there two yellow lights over there before? Maybe whatever farmer owned them shut them off?*” I thought to myself.

The tree tops in that area moved slightly out of turn with the wind, I turned my head  
and said to Talon,”Did you see something move in the tree line over there?” When I looked back everything was still except for the small breeze gently moving the tree tops.

He looked at the direction I was pointing. “No. But to be fair it's still low light and not easy to see much yet.”

We sat in silence for a while sipping coffee staring at the impenetrable forest. As the sun was just waking and beginning to cast a little more light, we both jumped out of my rusty old Ford, grabbed our gear and rifles and headed into the wall of birch before us. A choice both of us would soon regret.

Every hunter knows the feeling of walking into their blind or their favourite hunting spot in the early hours of the morning and the eerie silence that greets you. If you time it right, you are getting into position before most animals are up and about. The remaining birds that have not flown south are all roosted and anything that burrows is sleeping in its warm underground home waiting for the sun to rise. As the sun rises you can feel and hear the waking of the forest; crows start to caw, woodpeckers are drilling into trees, and coyotes are yipping and howling, rallying the troops for the day's hunt. The cold November sun begins its slow accent. Painting the sky with burnt oranges, yellows, and pinks that begin pushing out the deep blues and purples of the night. It streams through the trees that have gone to their winter slumber. It truly is a beautiful thing.

We started our walk with headlamps on, hearing only the crunch of the snow underneath our boots. Talon was a couple steps ahead of me. I looked to the left and to the right and even with our headlamps shining into the forest, it was so dense that it seemed to eat the light itself.

We talked to each other in hushed tones trying to be as quiet as we could, not wanting to possibly spook deer out of the area if something was bedded there.

“Hey man we’ve been walking for a good minute, how long do you think it's been?” I said. Talon responded in the same hushed tone, “ I’d guess about twenty minutes.”

“Ok, well we can give it around another ten but if this forest doesn't taper off soon I say we cut out and go back to our old spot on the farm.”

Talon nodded in agreement.

Just then Talon held up a hand to me, our sign to each other to stop everything because one of us heard something.

We both stood still. Straining to hear anything for a moment. What we heard did not require us to strain our ears. Branches bending and breaking a ways off but not too far. We looked at each other wide eyed. There are many things that can make sounds like that in the forest. Our guess was a bull moose. We grinned at the possibility of seeing a large moose with big paddles walking through the forest. We didn't have tags for a moose but they were always magnificent to see. There was something about the noise that seemed...off. It was too methodic. To deliberate. As fast as it started, it stopped.

We stood for a moment waiting for the sound again but it had disappeared. More sunlight was coming through and it was a bit easier to see now. The forest was thinning and looked like it might open up soon.

A pair of yellow lights dotted the distance. We pushed forward a couple more minutes to where the forest finally let out. We realized we were in a large bowl of sorts. The tree line went for miles in a large circle and in the middle were some islands of trees and small rolling hills.

“Well...” I sighed walking up to stand beside Talon. “Better choose a spot to set up before the sun gets too high.”

“Yep.” Talon said, pulling his binoculars from his chest rig and surveying the land. “What about that spot over there on top of that hill just outside that small area of trees.”

I followed his lead and took out my binoculars and set them to my eyes in the direction he was pointing.

“Yep. I like it. Gives us a good view of this area and with the wind direction will keep our scent pushing into that back area.” I said, while I pointed to a distant part of the bowl we were in.

We both holstered our binoculars and started the trek over to our temporary home for at least the next couple of hours.

We stopped about half way to our chosen spot when we saw a couple of white-tail doe in the distance along with one big beautiful buck. They were a ways off so we both looked through our binoculars and drooled over the buck. Now we were both grinning like the Cheshire Cat at the prospect of harvesting a buck like that. We hurried to our spot, kicking away the snow to get down to the dirt and underbrush that was still relatively dry. Then we settled in.

We sat there for a couple of hours with the sun rising to give us a full view of the beautiful landscape we were on. Crows flew by the forest quiet enough you could hear their wings flapping and gliding through the air. A hawk perched on one of the tall birch trees. It was scanning the snow with a watchful eye waiting for the faintest hint of a field mouse or small game to move the surface of the snow ringing its internal dinner bell. It had no such luck and eventually flew on.

We sat in our spot scanning the tree lines and used my buck grunt call every once and a while. We were trying to entice a mature buck our way. Hoping he would come to challenge our figment of a bigger buck, here to steal his haram of does. At one point, a lone doe and her baby that was most likely a yearling crossed about 300 yards in front of us. We just watched them and let them go on their merry way. We didn't have to say it to one another but something about this spot had gotten to us. If it wasn't a trophy buck, it wasn't worth the bullet.

The sun was high in the sky at this point. Time for a bit of food. I pulled out my thermos of coffee and poured some for Talon and I.

“Warm coffee, sitting in the trees hunting, nothing better hey?”  
“Except driving home with a deer in the back of the truck.” Talon said while laughing.

“Fair enough.” I laughed as well. “Hey, pass the jerky.”

We sat a while longer before eventually needing to stretch our legs. We were gathering our gear together to do a walk-about in the area. When we went to stand up, I looked down to grab my bag and when I did, my eyes tracked the tree line...there was a deer? My head snapped back up at what I thought I saw. There was nothing there but I swore I saw a deer's head half way up one of those trees. That didn't make any sense.

“Did you see that deer in that tree line?”

Talon was looking in a different direction with his binoculars. “No.” He swiveled to the tree line I was looking at scanning over it with his binos. “Nope not seeing anything...just a couple of yellow lights in the distance.”

“Yellow lights?” I pulled up my binoculars. “I can't see any.”  
Talon looked back through his looking glass. “Yeah right... huh. Must have been a lens flare.”

A chill went down my spine. Something was wrong. As we stepped out of our hiding spot I was just about to suggest that we should start making our way back to the truck when my mouth went dry and my knees almost gave out. What I saw I almost couldn't comprehend. I didn't have to ask Talon if he saw it as well as his gaze was locked onto the same spot.

Standing at the tree line, two-hundred yards to the right of where we had been looking, was a creature that stood bent over at the waist. My skin crawled as I stared at the thing peering out of the treeline through its yellow glowing eyes. As if it were a child peeking around a corner. Talon and I stared motionless at the creature staring back at us, it was also motionless in a kind of strange Mexican standoff of confusion and fear.

The creature had the face of a deer with large antlers, yellow glowing eyes, and an elongated neck. What could only be described as long black human hair was growing down from its head, almost touching its first elbow. The body looked much like a deer as far as the pelt went, but it looked patched together. Some of the patches were new, some old, and some of it was fur from other animals. I then saw patches that looked like skin...human skin? It was so thin you could see every bone and every distinct column of its spine. Its ribcage was set like a human's and I saw on one side, it had one human breast roughly stitched to itself. It had too many joints in its legs and arms; its feet were hooves but its hands... it had human hands. It flicked its tongue out in our direction, tasting the air. It was a serpent's tongue. The creature squinted its yellow glowing eyes and opened its mouth to reveal razor sharp multi rowed teeth like that of a shark. With its mouth fully open it made guttural noises then out of its mouth came “ HE... HEY... PSSS.. PA PASS ..THE JEK... it wailed like a demon being exorcised as if frustrated at the word. JERK... JERKY. Then in an instant it stood upright and disappeared into the treeline. When it stood its height was astoundingI t was at least 15 feet tall; half the height of the birch trees. My stomach dropped as I recalled the movement I saw from the truck.

We stood there staring at where the creature had been, our feet frozen to the ground, our bodies unwilling to move. As if we had stood there all winter and were nothing but frozen meat statues waiting for the spring thaw.  
Finally I shook the spell off, looked at Talons ghost white face, and through my dry mouth whispered, “What the fuck was that.” My head spun, the yellow lights...that thing had been watching us from the start.

In the distance now, in a different part of the trees, we heard something like Talon's voice, “I...ID... GUESS... TWENT...TWE...TWENTY MINUTES.”

It could move fast, too fast.

We crawled back slowly into our hunting spot, trying to keep our heads on straight and our breathing under control.

I repeated myself, “What the fuck, what the fuck was that?”

“I don't know...Fuck I don't know. How are we going to get out of here? That's the tree line we came in from.”

I peeked out of our hunting spot. He was right. About 100 yards to the left from where we saw the creature was the path that we had come out on. Shit.

We looked around but saw no other blatant entrance points though the trees. We were trapped. We had been funneled in and now there was only one way out. Somehow, we needed to get to that road and back to my rusty old Ford waiting like a beacon of hope just off the gravel road. I never thought of that old bucket of bolts more fondly than in that moment.

“Ok.” I said barely in a whisper, “We need to get to that path. Leave anything here that you don't absolutely need to be carrying. The faster we can move, the better.”

Lucky for us there was only light snow on the ground so we could run at a dead sprint with no problem, but the same advantage would be given to that...thing.

I continued,”We can hop from one small collection of trees to the next until we get to that last one over there.” I breathed out a shaky breath, “Then we can plan from there but I think it's going to have to be an all out sprint down the path from there. What do you think?”

Talon took a moment studying the terrain, eyes still wide with fear. “Yeah I agree.” He paused, “How many rounds did you bring in?”

I stared at him for a second,”Three” “Same,” he replied.

“Pick your shots wisely"" I said, directed at myself as much as him. I surveyed the area and the sun was starting to sink. “Let's go.”

We darted as quickly and quietly as we could from tree line to treeline. Stopping only to catch our breath and try to listen for movement or any other sound coming from the creature. Hard to do over your heart pounding in your ears not only from the running but also the pure adrenaline of fighting for your life. We had dumped most of our stuff at our first hunting spot, only keeping our rifles, skinning knives and wallets. We also ditched our blaze orange attire figuring if that thing could see color we would be better off in our camo shirts we had underneath.

We came to the second to last bunch of trees. We watched and waited and...GO. We ran. Half way to the last collection of trees the hair stood up on the back of my neck. I could feel it watching. Realizing I lost Talon beside me, I slowed turned back over my right shoulder. Talon was standing still, his Savage 30-06 raised. I could see him shaking and trying to keep the gun steady enough to take a decent shot. The creature stood just out of the treeline slightly behind us at around 300 yards out. I raised my Bergara 300 Win. Mag to meet the creature as well, shaking while I did so. We both pulled the trigger, mine slightly after his. My shot missed as the creature bent and contorted after being grazed by the first shot that skinned its outer arm. It growled and screeched looking at its long arm that had been injured, clasping the wound with one of its human hands. It snapped its head back to look at us and screamed. It sounded like a woman being skinned alive. Then it fell back into the treeline. 4 rounds left. We cycled our bolts and put a new round in the chamber. Talon caught up to me at a full run and didn't stop. I matched his pace as he ran by.

Through laboured breath I yelled, “Pass the trees! To the Path! Don’t Stop!” No arguments there.

We ran past the last bunch of trees checking over our shoulders from time to time while we ran. We came up to the opening of trees and as our feet hit the path to salvation we heard an unnerving version of my voice at a distance, “DON'T STOP, PASS THE TREE...S,DONT STOP.” It was getting better at mimicking us.

We ran down that path for what seemed like forever, adrenaline carrying us. We could see the trees starting to thin. “*Yes!*” I thought, “*We are almost there! We are almost out!*”. I could not wait to see that old ford and that gravel road. We blew through the opening almost in tandem like watching two olympic runners fighting for first place crossing the finish line. Our eyes adjusted to the light.

“No...” “NO!”

We were standing where, just hours earlier, we had stood looking through our binoculars picking a spot to hunt.

Talon looked at me, both of us huffing, our breath hanging in the cold air as clouds, steam floating off our bodies. “What...what the fuck! How is this possible? It was a straight path! What the...” He was cut off.

We both locked onto two yellow orbs floating in the collection of trees we had passed not long before while running from the creature. It was watching us from those same trees. We raised our rifles. I took my shot. The eyes disappeared. No sound from the creature. Talon held a bead on where the eyes had been but didn't fire. Three rounds left. I cycled my bolt. I had one round. Talon had two.

“You think I got him?” I said heedlessly. “No idea.”

Right. Dumb question. Like he would know if I killed the monster in the woods. As if we were still hunting for deer and not an abomination that hell itself spat out onto this plane of existence.

We tucked into the trees just off the path keeping an eye on where the creature had been and where it could be going. We were losing daylight. If you have ever been up north in the winter, the days are not very long. We could be in pitch black by 6 o'clock. We needed a plan and fast.

While keeping an eye on our surroundings we talked about what just happened. We ran down a straight path and somehow ended back where we started. What the hell do you do with that?

“What do you think we should do?” I said mind moving so fast I felt like I could take flight. “We do it again.” Talon responded

“Again?” I responded with a dumbfounded look on my face. “You know what they say about doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.”

“Yeah yeah but we're not going to do it the same way.”  
“How can you run down a path differently?” I said sarcasm dripping off my words.

Talon picked up a small stick and whacked me in the head with it. “Pay attention dumbass.” He started to draw in the snow. I continued to watch the trees and field while he drew.

“We run just like before but this time watching our tracks.” He drew out a path with arrows as our tracks, “We each have a one set of tracks going out towards the truck and we each have two sets coming into the bowl"" he drew a horizontal line across where the tracks changed direction. “If we find where the tracks change direction that should be where the loop starts. Then if we go off the path into the woods and push through the trees we might be able to get out.”

My eyes searched his drawing. It was a loose theory but at this point with no other ideas and both of us not being well versed in time-space loops; we would have to roll the dice.

“Well hell, works for me.” I said, scratching my beard. My mind wandered to both our families we had left this morning. For the first time since this shit show started, I looked at Talon and said, “If I don't make it out, you let my family know what happened here and that we both fought like hell.”

“I'd ask the same of you.” Talon replied.

We exchanged wallets in the event one of us got out and the other didn’t. We wanted to be able to give them back to our wives as a gesture of going out in a fight together. It was all we had on us really and seemed to mean something at the time as silly as it sounds.

We both nodded, understanding our agreement. Live or die. We weren't going down easy.

We peeked out from our spot in the trees. Something rustled in the bushes just behind us, the wind picked up. It had a putrid smell, something long dead and rotting. Then a flash of yellow.

Time to go.

Talon and I hit the ground at a full sprint glancing down to check our tracks as we went. Talon checked over his shoulder.

“Shit!” he shouted. He dug his lead foot into the ground and spun, raising his rifle.  
I looked over my shoulder and watched as the thing, which was far too close for comfort, gained on us.

A shot rang out.  
Talon hadn't fully shouldered his rifle to look down his scope but as if in slow motion, I saw the creature's thigh ripple. He got him. Not a killing blow but it would hurt like hell and hopefully slow him down. “Yes!” I thought, “Good hit!""

The monster stopped in its tracks and looked at its new wound. We, however, did not stop. At full run Talon cycled his bolt. Two rounds left. “Keep going!” I yelled “Good hit! Good fucking hit!”

We ran, putting distance between the creature still standing and staring at its new hole in its thigh. We watched our tracks as we ran.

“Here!” Talon yelled. We hit where the tracks changed and skidded to a halt. Off in the distance the creature was barely visible and it slowly raised its head to look at us. I squinted as it opened its mouth and a new voice came out of it. One that it could mimic perfectly. A woman's voice.

“HELP ME! SOMEBODY FUCKING HELP ME! ANYONE! NO. PLEASE NO!”  
Its words echoed down the path and dissipated into the trees. We were not the first to come here.

“Come on!” Talon shouted from just inside the treeline. “Move your ass!”

I snapped back into my body, turned on my heels and ran behind him into the thick forest that was losing light by the minute. I cursed at the sun. Then I chortled to myself how stupid it sounded. As if it could hear me or as if it would care that I needed another hour or two of sunlight. Like it would stop doing what it had been doing since time began and God spoke it into existence.

We ran as fast as we could through the thick brush when my thoughts of the universe were cut short by that horrific scent and snapping branches close by.

Talon and I dove into different spots behind trees. I pressed myself up against and as far underneath a bigger downed tree as I could. I could barely make out Talon in his hiding spot. Good. I guess the darkness does have its benefits. We stayed still and tried to stifle our heavy breath. Like the worst game of hide and seek I had ever been a part of. My heart was beating so loud in my ears I thought the beast might hear it.

Silence. No birds to keep us company, no distant coyotes, no branches snapping. Utter grueling silence. A breeze crept through the trees. The scent was stronger, much stronger. It was nauseating. As I tried to keep my breakfast and coffee in my stomach, a creaking noise came from the log I was under. I looked with my eyes but didn't move my head as a large hand with overgrown, broken nails and fingers far too long with too many joints wrapped around the log. I shook as I turned my eyes skyward to look at the beast. The smell was unbearable at this point. I watched as the beast leaned just past the log looking forward, not at me but scanning the trees in front of me. It swayed from left to right looking slowly making low clicks and other quiet guttural noises. That's when it spotted something of interest, it stopped swaying and locked onto something tongue flicking out and in. I knew it was in Talon's direction. I raised my rifle pointing straight up. Said a quick prayer and pulled the trigger.

The shot rang. As did my ears. The beast fell backwards kicking and screaming. My ears were still ringing, the creature sounded distant although it was flailing right behind me. In the chaos, one of the beast's finger nails cut down my back from shoulder to ass leaving a decent wound. It didn't even register at the time.

Talon ran out of the dark into my view, grabbed the rifle out of hand and threw it to the side. I must have looked in a daze cause he slapped my face a few times before I registered him yelling at me, “MOVE YOUR FEET!”.

We ran into the trees pushing the wailing creature farther and farther behind us. A while later, maybe an hour? We fell out of the tree line into soft deep snow. We both looked around farmers fields and with the moon out we could see in the distance a gravel road. We had made it.

“No way...no fucking way!” Talon shouted, a smile creeping across his face. He was just as surprised as me not only had his plan worked but we were both still alive.

Although in rough condition from running through such thick woods with scrapes and gouges and my back cut open, we were both alive. We started making our way back to the truck as quickly as we could although the snow had gotten quite deep.

“The snow wasn't this deep when we got here,"" I said looking at Talon. “No, no it wasn’t.

Both of us had a sinking feeling in our gut. We moved a little faster through the snow. Then we came around the corner of the trees and there gleaming in the moonlight was the rusty old Ford. It lightened our spirits for a moment, but we noticed the truck had a good foot and a half of snow on it. We stumbled back to the truck. I fumbled my keys out and opened her up. Talon ejected his last full round and caught it. It was our last remaining life line. He stared at it for a moment then vomited beside the truck which made me do the same.

I put the key in and prayed she would turn over. The old display on the radio slowly came to life. I turned the key and after two turns I kicked the gas pedal. The old girl begrudgingly roared to life and Colter was back singing his song Thirteen Silver Dollars,  
“*It was a cold and cruel evening*

*Sneaking up on Speedy Creek*  
*I found myself sleepin' in the snow*  
*For one or two odd reasons*  
*I ain't too proud to repeat*  
*For now, we'll say I had no place to go...*

I patted the dash. “Thanks ol’ girl you never let me down.” The sound of my old truck running and my CD playing brought tears to my eyes.

We kicked a bit of snow off the truck but didn't spend time making her pretty, the faster we got out of here the better.  
As I was turning the truck around Talon reached into the glove box and pulled his phone out and booted it on. When the android logo disappeared, the time read 1:45am. December 13th. His battery had just enough juice to kick on, get to his lock screen and then die.

“December 13th”, I said, wanting to vomit again. What the hell happened. As we drove away down the gravel road I glanced in my rearview mirror. At two yellow lights dotting the path we had walked into that morning or... two weeks prior? I don't know anymore. The yellow lights got higher in the darkness and disappeared. I hit the gas harder and turned up the radio a little louder. I spaced out driving down the moonlit gravel road as Colter sang,

“*The sun is gone away now*  
*Green grass turns to brown*  
*Every December it gets a little bit harder To lay that bottle down*  
*It's more than just the weather*  
*That plagues this prairie town*

*But I won't be seeing you*  
*When I come 'round*  
*Every day it seems*  
*My whole damn life's just a codeine dream I don't dream of you anymore...”*

I got my luckyscent sorce order. A full size, two travels and some samples. Thought I’d give my thoughts on a few. I’m definitely a gourmand spicy lover but can appreciate a good clean girl scent as well. 

These are just my opinion!! But I thought a review with a general feeling of “hmmmm” plus a few standouts might help, because there’s definitely heavy hype around this brand. Overall I’m glad I picked some things up and supported an indie brand. 

Match made in heaven- heavy on the vanilla ice cream waffle cone note out of the gate, then the matcha and some earthiness comes through on the dry down. Fun!!  It’s certainly matcha!! 

Snow moon magic: I confidently bought a full bottle of this, and yeah. Creamy chai latte loveliness. I’m excited to see how the longevity is. 

2am in Lafayette: smells spot on like Cafe Du Mond, with the slightly burnt rubber smell of chicory included. I think I prefer Akro Awake for a coffee scent. 

Ephemera: as it dries down it definitely smells…wet. Like acorns. And fall. With a *hint* of sweet. If you’re into that. 

In dreams and fairytales: so, it’s got a chamomile note…. I am so sorry. It smells like dandelions. I dry-heaved. This is unfortunate. 

Stuck on you: it’s candy caramel apple! They’re good at photorealistic scents that’s for sure. Super fun. Not too sickly gourmand like a baked good scent. It’s still got some fruity pop fun 

English major: anyone who describes this as gourmand take that with a grain of salt. For me, it’s heavy on the oak and old books. HINT of sweet. 

Cookie party: I think for the price and barrier to access, you can find other cookie/baked goods fragrances. It’s not standing out to me. I hate to say this but….just buy a gourmand lataffa. 

What big eyes you have: lovely lemon meringue scent, wow! Lemon bar scent, to a T. ",20,1762479514.0,Indiemakeupandmore,2,0.95,False
1oqhhfd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqhhfd,Marble Fest 2025,"I'd like to share an article about the 2025 Marble Fest in my home town, Paden City, WV sponsored by Marble King and share some pics. It's a long article but worth the time. 


I’m sorry for the delayed post. Thank you so much, Gabi Cooper for the amazing write up and photos! 

The 2025 Paden City Marble Festival: Where Grit Rekindles Community Glow

Life is a swirl of color and change, full of gentle motion, quiet lessons, and glimmers that guide us forward. At thirty, I find myself caught within that motion, with no clear path, just movement, light, and the soft promise that it's all leading somewhere good. After a decade of many turns and tumbles, some smooth and some rough, I can't help but wonder if I've lost my place in the spin, or if I'm simply being reshaped, as we all are over time. Much like a marble, made from the same silica sand that built West Virginia's glass towns, shaped by fire and motion, each turn and polish reveals a little more of who we are and the light we carry.
Paden City, West Virginia, knows this current of change by heart. Once rooted by its high school and the steady warmth of its industries, the town continues to renew itself with quiet strength and a shared brightness that refuses to fade. Losing the high school felt a bit like losing a grandparent, a steady heartbeat that had guided us for generations. Yet the spirit of what was lost hasn't vanished; it has simply changed form, living on through the people, the stories, and the small, everyday magic that return and remain.
The Ohio River tells the same story. It carries not only driftwood and debris, but gifts of color and memory-shards of Wissmach glass, petals of painted pottery, and tiny orbs of wonder we call marbles. Paden City, too, keeps glistening in that current of renewal. What washes up isn't always what we expect, yet it carries memory, endurance, and a beauty born of pressure and time.
It was during a quiet season of change, when I felt caught between where I'd been and where I was going, that I crossed paths with Steve Strother II. It felt serendipitous in the way only small town life can. Steve, kind, optimistic, and funny as ever, mentioned needing help with the Marble Festival, and something inside me stirred. The invitation felt like more than chance, a small, shining sign, like finding a perfect marble glinting along the Ohio River's edge. It was as if the town itself was calling me home, steadying me in that familiar kind of love only a small place can give.
Steve, who has watched Paden City bend and evolve through the years, offered me the chance to step back into the story and be part of something larger than my own uncertainty, something that connects the present with the past, the familiar with the unknown. I've lived in Paden City long enough to know that a place like this, built from glass, grit, and grace, has a way of keeping hold of its people, even when they wander far or drift somewhere quiet inside themselves. So I said yes. Even though I wasn't sure what I was stepping into, I had a quiet sense that the simple act of showing up, of helping out, might polish something within me that had grown dim.
Marbles are more than just toys here. They're handmade vessels, fossils of joy, memory, and artistry that carry the spirit of a community forward, unbroken. I hadn't realized just how long I'd been 

wandering, lost in my own mind and swirl, until I found myself surrounded by this simple kind of beauty again. That's when Mr. Ed Amos and his wife stopped by the booth I was helping with. I'd gone to school with their grandkids, and we exchanged a few easy, familiar words as they admired the marbles and displays. I mentioned, half-laughing, that I'm thirty and still not sure what I want to be when I grow up. He smiled and said, ""I'm seventy-eight, and I still don't know what I want to be when I grow up either."" His words carried no pity, no need to fix me, just quiet honesty. It felt like permission to breathe, to let go of the pressure I'd been holding onto. For a moment, I wasn't alone in my uncertainty. It was as if the whole town, this strange and wonderful web of people, was quietly nodding in recognition, offering support without judgment.

And then there was Steve. At forty-eight, he wasn't just a boy searching for marbles in the grass anymore; he had become the heartbeat of the festival, a glass artist who turned childhood wonder into legacy. What began years ago as a small celebration for marble lovers in Sistersville, West Virginia, has blossomed into a gathering that now fills Paden City Park, drawing visitors from across the country.

In Steve, I saw the embodiment of reinvention, a boy who once dug through the dirt now creates and curates magic for whole generations. His booth was more than a table of glass; it was a meeting place for memory. The more I spoke with visitors, the more I realized that the festival wasn't really about marbles at all. It was about us, the people who stayed, the people who returned, and the ones who never really left. The Marble Festival hums not with competition, but with connection-family, history, endurance, and love. In that moment, I didn't need to have all the answers. I didn't need to know exactly where I was going. Sometimes it's enough just to be here, to feel connected, supported, and embraced by the people and the place that help shape you.

Both the Paul Wissmach Glass Company and Marble King are fused into the very heart of Paden City.
Each has weathered loss and change, yet still carries the warmth and spirit of the people who built this town with their hands and hope. Several summers ago, I was hired by the new owners of Wissmach Glass, Jason Wilburn and Annabelle Javier, to help create a historical timeline for the factory, a project meant to honor and preserve a story that has glowed at the center of our valley for more than a century.
It never felt like work; it felt like being trusted with a thread in a family quilt, one that needed to be patched and passed down before time frayed its edges. Just down the road, the Marble King factory keeps rolling, quite literally. Dig beneath the grass in Paden City and you'll find more than dirt. You'll uncover the town's pulse: tiny, glimmering spheres resting quietly in the soil, waiting for curious hands. They're more than toys; they're pieces of who we are, born of fire and river sand, carried from palm to palm, pocket to pocket, generation to generation.
During the festival, it struck me how marbles have always been part of our story, not just mine, but everyone's here. They sit in jars on grandmas' shelves, fill old coffee cans in grandpas' garages, hide in shoeboxes, and pass through the small hands of children like bits of sunlight. They've even traveled far, finding their way onto the big screen-
-those same Paden City marbles sparkling in The Goonies and beyond, carrying a little of this valley's light into the wider world. They connect us backward to those who built this town from sand and flame, and forward to those who will carry that light into new hands.

For more than a hundred years, glass and marble, heat and hands, patience and pride, have been the backbone of Paden City's story. They are proof of our grit and grace, of a town that's been tested and tumbled, yet always finds its way back to the furnace, shining a little brighter each time.

The Paden City Marble Festival brings all of this together. It isn't just about glass; it's about a town insisting that its history matters, and that its future is worth celebrating too. Plans are already in motion for 2026, with hopes of adding more artists and drawing collectors from across the globe. But I know where I'll be when September rolls around again: right here in Paden City, this little Appalachian Eden, letting marbles remind me that no matter how hardened life makes us, there's always a place to soften, to pause, to breathe, and to belong. The 2025 Marble Festival was more than an event. It was a celebration of reinvention, connection, and the enduring love that ties this town together. In the end, it reminds us that while loss and change are inevitable, Paden City's essence its creativity, resilience, and spirit of togetherness— will always remain.

1oqhgmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/aigovcon/comments/1oqhgmx/how_i_started_government_contracting_a_journey/,How I Started Government Contracting: A Journey from Curiosity to Contracts,"# How I Started Government Contracting: A Journey from Curiosity to Contracts

# The Accidental Discovery

I never set out to become a government contractor. Like many small business owners, I was simply looking for stable, recurring revenue. That's when a fellow entrepreneur mentioned over coffee: ""You know the government buys what you sell, right?""

I didn't know. And that conversation changed everything.

# The Overwhelming Beginning

My first visit to [SAM.gov](http://SAM.gov) felt like reading a foreign language. Acronyms everywhere: RFP, RFQ, NAICS, CAGE, PSC. I remember thinking, ""There's no way I can figure this out.""

But the numbers were too compelling to ignore:

* **$750+ billion** in annual federal contract spending
* Thousands of opportunities posted daily
* Set-asides for small businesses

I decided to give it 90 days. If I couldn't land even one contract, I'd move on.

# The First Steps (That Actually Mattered)

# 1. Getting Registered (The Tedious Part)

I started with the basics:

* [**SAM.gov**](http://SAM.gov) **registration** \- Took about 2 weeks to complete
* **CAGE code** \- Received automatically through SAM
* **NAICS codes** \- I picked my top 5 most relevant codes

**Pro tip**: Don't rush this. Your NAICS codes determine what opportunities you'll see.

# 2. Understanding My Market

Instead of chasing every opportunity, I asked myself:

* What do I already do well?
* What can I deliver consistently?
* What's my competitive advantage?

I narrowed my focus to **\[your niche/industry\]** where I already had 5+ years of experience.

# 3. The Learning Curve

I devoured content:

* YouTube videos on government contracting
* Free SBA workshops
* PTAC (Procurement Technical Assistance Center) counseling
* Online communities and forums (or use ChatGPT now)

# The First Proposal (And Rejection)

Three months in, I found an opportunity that seemed perfect. Small contract, clear requirements, aligned with my capabilities.

I spent **40 hours** on that proposal.

I didn't win.

But the debriefing call was gold. The contracting officer pointed out:

* My pricing wasn't competitive
* My past performance section was weak
* I didn't address two technical requirements

**That feedback was worth more than the contract itself.**

# The Breakthrough

Six months after starting, I landed my first contract 🎉

What made the difference:

1. **Relationship building** \- I attended an industry day and met the project manager
2. **Better proposals** \- I learned to mirror the RFP language exactly
3. **Realistic pricing** \- I studied previous awards to understand market rates
4. **Past performance** \- I included relevant commercial work as examples

That first contract led to two more with the same agency within a year.

# What I Wish I'd Known on Day One

# Do This:

* **Start small** \- Don't chase $10M contracts as your first bid
* **Build relationships** \- Government buyers are people too
* **Track everything** \- Every proposal teaches you something
* **Join a team** \- Subcontracting is a legitimate path in
* **Be patient** \- 6-12 months to first contract is normal

# Avoid This:

* **Chasing every opportunity** \- Focus beats volume
* **Skipping the debriefing** \- Always ask why you lost
* **Weak past performance** \- Use commercial work if needed
* **Ignoring set-asides** \- If you qualify, use them
* **Going it alone** \- Find a mentor or community

# The Reality Check

Government contracting isn't easy money. Here's what I deal with:

* **Long sales cycles** \- 3-6 months from bid to award is typical, so create a pipeline
* **Extensive paperwork** \- Compliance isn't optional
* **Payment delays** \- Net 30 often becomes net 45-60
* **Strict requirements** \- No shortcuts or ""good enough""

But the advantages:

* **Stable revenue** \- Multi-year contracts provide predictability
* **Fair competition** \- Small businesses get legitimate opportunities
* **Growth potential** \- Each contract builds credibility
* **Recession resistant** \- Government keeps buying

I’m really into lattes. I love the shaken hazelnut oat milk latte from Starbucks. When I try to make something similar at home, it’s just not the same and it honestly has a bad aftertaste. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

So my husband loves French press coffee, he used to have a pot a day of the strong stuff, but recently he’s switched to coffee bags because they are more convenient and he found a brand he loves. 

I’m a bit of a clean freak, add OCD to my list of disorders, (yes I have a legitimate diagnosis) so I clean a lot, my brain tells me if I don’t clean I’ll get sick and die and all my loved ones will hate me for dying, if you have OCD you get me. 
I do the cleaning and chores because he works more than I do and earns more money for us  than what I bring in, plus I do feel more calm after I do the cleaning. 

However I tried multiple times to clean my husband’s coffee plunger but the texture of the wet coffee grounds really gives me the ick, so I’ve asked him to clean his coffee plunger because it really makes me feel icky, he said he will but he often just leaves his plunger there for a few days with bits of coffee grounds at the bottom and then I cave and clean it, don’t get me wrong I nag the hell out of him but since he’s been drinking the coffee bags he just forgets about the stinky old coffee grounds in the plunger. 

I’ve tried leaving it in the sink, I’ve tried nagging him lol, and he just never cleans it. SO I decided fuck it, I won’t clean it. It’s been almost a month and it has officially gone mouldy, I noticed it in my weekly deep clean and almost vomited, I knew it had some yuck in it but not this bad, it was behind a roll of paper towel so I didn’t see it until now, so I put it in the middle of the kitchen counter with a note saying “you didn’t clean it, it went mouldy  :) “ for him to see when he gets home from work (I’ll be at work when he gets home)

But now I feel bad, I could of just cleaned the damn thing but I’m also frustrated and I want him to help out a bit more with the cleaning and I feel the note is too passive aggressive and I don’t want a fight over a stupid plunger! I also bought him this plunger as a gift so I feel I need to replace it? 

Help? Am I being too much of an asshole? What should I do? ",3,1762479170.0,AITAH,5,0.81,False

1oqhbv7,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320513003743,The interactions of caffeine with monoamine oxidase,"I asked chat to summarize:

Caffeine can slightly block the enzymes MAO-A and MAO-B (these help break down brain chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine).
	•	It attaches to these enzymes in a temporary and competitive way — meaning it doesn’t permanently change them, it just gets in the way for a bit.

What it means:
	•	Even though caffeine can act as an MAO inhibitor, it’s actually very weak at doing this.
	•	The amount of caffeine people usually have in their blood after drinking coffee (normal consumption) is far too low to make any real difference in MAO activity in the body.
	•	However, if scientists use very high doses of caffeine in lab or cell experiments, it could affect MAO activity — so that needs to be considered in research settings.",2,1762479081.0,MAOIs,0,1.0,False

1oqh8sg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqh8sg,Help design my small studio apartment,"Hi Reddit
I would like your help re-designing my studio apartment

Context:
I was living in this rented small studio apartment by myself, now my girlfriend is moved in with me and we would like to make it more enjoyable for both.

Here are our requirements:
- in the 3d model, is missing the bathroom and the kitchen
- the kitchen is very small, but already maximized. Due to space limitation, we have to place some of the item in the living room like: full size fridge, Thermomix (kitchen robot), soda stream, and a coffee machine.
- we both can work remotely (I manly go to office)
- we would like to have a proper wardrobe
- drilling is doable only on 2 walls (window wall and longer flat wall) as they are the only 2 concrete wall
- we would like to be able to host friends for dinner/movie/boardgame night 
- apartment height is 280cm
- on the 273cm wall there is a switch for the curtains (not properly positioned in the 3d model)
- on the 212cm wall there is a vent for air filtration/circulation
- the big window can be fully open and bring you to a small balcony
- internet cable plug is aligned with the air vent
- we also have a small basement storage room ~1.5mx3m

What we currently have in the apartment:

Sleep:
- 140x200 bad + bedframe with underneath storage

Work area:
- 200x60 desk table with standing lag
- ergonomic chair
- 32"" monitor on a movable arm
- smart desk lamp
- mac mini m4

Relax:
- projector xiaomi
- billy library
- poaxng chair 

Dining/cooking:
- table Ikea vihals 125x74 LxW
- 2 chairs (plus one extra in the basement)
- banch with storage room, that can act as a table seating too ~120cm x 30cm
- soda stram
- Thermomix 
- Coffee Machine

Clothes:
- we have a small open wardrobe 100x150x45(WxHxD)
- definitely not enough for both
- (and a space in the entrance for jackets and shoes)

The picture are old and just to give more context (i.e. the couch has been removed)

We are open to any suggestions, and open to rid of existing things in favour of more functional one

 To further help, I tried to recreate the layout in sketch 3D: feel free to download it and modify it

1oqh8ob,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheBankPoisonGoblin/comments/1oqh8ob/a_walk_through_the_birch_trees/,A Walk Through the Birch Trees,"I am a hunter. I like spending time in the woods. Being outside, smelling the fresh, crisp air of hunting season in Canada has grown to be my favourite time of year. Every year, I look forward to being out in the fields and woods taking a break from the city.

Hunting is something I learned from my uncle who grew up hunting and trapping throughout his youth. It is a passion he passed down to me. When I was 15 years old he taught me how to hunt, track, gut, skin, and butcher large game. It is a process that connects you to your food, the land, and nature.

It is something I truly love and something that when my friend Talon said “Hey I’d be interested in hunting, could you show me the ropes?” I grinned so big I could’ve put the Cheshire Cat to shame. There were many years where we hunted the same property together and I showed him what my uncle had taught me, what I had learned, and we learned new things together over the years. We both looked forward to hunting season each year... but now, after what happened this season, I don't know if either of us will ever step foot in the woods again.

The property we usually hunted on was a farmers land that we both knew and they were happy to let us on each season. We had heard of a new spot another hour and a half from the farmers field, a spot on Crown Land. Crown Land for those who don't know is simply land that is owned by the Government of Canada. Although a ways out, as the farmers land we hunted was already an hour from the city we lived, we figured we would give this new spot a chance. We made the decision as it was rumored there were some big white-tail bucks in that area, possibly trophy status big. Talon and I always hunted for the freezer; which is to say the antlers on the deer were not the deciding factor in taking the animal. We wanted a full freezer to feed our families, plain and simple. However something about this tale of these prize deer got under our skin. Come to think of it, I'm not even sure where we heard about this place. A friend of a friend whose uncle's brother knew about it, that sort of thing. Now that I am sitting here typing this out, I cannot recall where we heard of this spot. I asked Talon about it and he doesn't remember either.

It was a hunting morning like any other. I woke up and wiped my weary eyes staring at the alarm clock that read Nov. 28th/2024, 4:15 am. I texted Talon that I was up and getting things ready. He simply sent me a thumbs up. I gathered all my gear together, packed some snacks, jerky, peanuts, and a thermos of coffee. Then I double checked I had my licences, ammunition and of course, my rifle. I crept back into my room to kiss my wife on the forehead and said a soft “Love you, bye”. She barely even flinched, just continued her steady soft snoring, content to sleep under her warm blankets and not be going out into the cold late November weather at such an ungodly hour. Normally I wouldn't be getting up quite this early for hunting but with the extra drive and not knowing this new spots landscape Talon and I agreed the earlier, the better.

I picked up Talon at his house, his morning routine I’m sure went very similar to my own. We greeted each other with bags under our eyes, smiles on our faces and we were both sporting the blaze orange jackets and hats that everyone knows so well. We already had a full tank of gas and full coffee mugs so it was time to hit the road.

In November in Central Canada, the weather varies greatly this time of year. Some years, you're sitting in -30C your testicals turning into ice cubes with snow flying directly into your face all the while blazing a trail through three feet of snow. Other times you're out in a cool breeze with a light jacket still feeling the sun on your skin. This year we had a bit of snow on the ground, just enough to leave a solid boot track and the temperature was sitting around -10C. In my opinion, great hunting weather. It wasn't too windy either which was a bonus. Throughout our drive we shot the breeze about our families, work, and what the sneaky politicians in Ontario were cooking up next. All the while a Colter Wall CD played in the background. The highways and gravel roads we took to get there were nothing exciting. A couple of bends here and there, a slow winding highway in the pitch black, only lit up by my truck's old headlights. Then we hit the rumble of the grid road. We were just getting the first formation of light when we pulled up to the spot. The kind of light that can trick your eyes. It can make objects blurry as you strain to get enough light into your retinas to make out whatever it is you're looking at. We pulled up to what felt like a wall of birch trees with a walking path going through them. Not quite wide enough for two guys to walk side by side. I don't know if I had ever seen a birch forest that thick before. Across the distant horizon in the early morning hours, small yellow and white lights dotted across the fields and horizon from farm houses and barns.

I pulled off the gravel road a bit and cut the engine just as Colter was singing the end of his song Bald Butte,  
*“Bald Butte, Bald Butte, so lofty and so high.*  
*Carry me to Bald Butte where the planes wrap ‘round the sky.*

*You can dig a hole on Bald Butte when I die.”*

In the silence with the truck off, and Colter subsequently singing no more, Talon whistled softly and said “That's some tall birch”.

I nodded, neither of us breaking our stare at the forest in front of us.

“Well, this will be an interesting spot to say the least.” I said, hoping that the forest would eventually break open into some open fields that would give us an opportunity to take a shot at a deer. I couldn't even finish my thought when a slight bit of movement caught the corner of my eye. Among the birch it had looked as though something had moved and disappeared in line with the trees. As if a tree being weighed down from snow was finally released and snapped upright, disappearing among its tree counter parts. The problem was it made no sound.

*“Wasn't there two yellow lights over there before? Maybe whatever farmer owned them shut them off?*” I thought to myself.

The tree tops in that area moved slightly out of turn with the wind, I turned my head  
and said to Talon,”Did you see something move in the tree line over there?” When I looked back everything was still except for the small breeze gently moving the tree tops.

He looked at the direction I was pointing. “No. But to be fair it's still low light and not easy to see much yet.”

We sat in silence for a while sipping coffee staring at the impenetrable forest. As the sun was just waking and beginning to cast a little more light, we both jumped out of my rusty old Ford, grabbed our gear and rifles and headed into the wall of birch before us. A choice both of us would soon regret.

Every hunter knows the feeling of walking into their blind or their favourite hunting spot in the early hours of the morning and the eerie silence that greets you. If you time it right, you are getting into position before most animals are up and about. The remaining birds that have not flown south are all roosted and anything that burrows is sleeping in its warm underground home waiting for the sun to rise. As the sun rises you can feel and hear the waking of the forest; crows start to caw, woodpeckers are drilling into trees, and coyotes are yipping and howling, rallying the troops for the day's hunt. The cold November sun begins its slow accent. Painting the sky with burnt oranges, yellows, and pinks that begin pushing out the deep blues and purples of the night. It streams through the trees that have gone to their winter slumber. It truly is a beautiful thing.

We started our walk with headlamps on, hearing only the crunch of the snow underneath our boots. Talon was a couple steps ahead of me. I looked to the left and to the right and even with our headlamps shining into the forest, it was so dense that it seemed to eat the light itself.

We talked to each other in hushed tones trying to be as quiet as we could, not wanting to possibly spook deer out of the area if something was bedded there.

“Hey man we’ve been walking for a good minute, how long do you think it's been?” I said. Talon responded in the same hushed tone, “ I’d guess about twenty minutes.”

“Ok, well we can give it around another ten but if this forest doesn't taper off soon I say we cut out and go back to our old spot on the farm.”

Talon nodded in agreement.

Just then Talon held up a hand to me, our sign to each other to stop everything because one of us heard something.

We both stood still. Straining to hear anything for a moment. What we heard did not require us to strain our ears. Branches bending and breaking a ways off but not too far. We looked at each other wide eyed. There are many things that can make sounds like that in the forest. Our guess was a bull moose. We grinned at the possibility of seeing a large moose with big paddles walking through the forest. We didn't have tags for a moose but they were always magnificent to see. There was something about the noise that seemed...off. It was too methodic. To deliberate. As fast as it started, it stopped.

We stood for a moment waiting for the sound again but it had disappeared. More sunlight was coming through and it was a bit easier to see now. The forest was thinning and looked like it might open up soon.

A pair of yellow lights dotted the distance. We pushed forward a couple more minutes to where the forest finally let out. We realized we were in a large bowl of sorts. The tree line went for miles in a large circle and in the middle were some islands of trees and small rolling hills.

“Well...” I sighed walking up to stand beside Talon. “Better choose a spot to set up before the sun gets too high.”

“Yep.” Talon said, pulling his binoculars from his chest rig and surveying the land. “What about that spot over there on top of that hill just outside that small area of trees.”

I followed his lead and took out my binoculars and set them to my eyes in the direction he was pointing.

“Yep. I like it. Gives us a good view of this area and with the wind direction will keep our scent pushing into that back area.” I said, while I pointed to a distant part of the bowl we were in.

We both holstered our binoculars and started the trek over to our temporary home for at least the next couple of hours.

We stopped about half way to our chosen spot when we saw a couple of white-tail doe in the distance along with one big beautiful buck. They were a ways off so we both looked through our binoculars and drooled over the buck. Now we were both grinning like the Cheshire Cat at the prospect of harvesting a buck like that. We hurried to our spot, kicking away the snow to get down to the dirt and underbrush that was still relatively dry. Then we settled in.

We sat there for a couple of hours with the sun rising to give us a full view of the beautiful landscape we were on. Crows flew by the forest quiet enough you could hear their wings flapping and gliding through the air. A hawk perched on one of the tall birch trees. It was scanning the snow with a watchful eye waiting for the faintest hint of a field mouse or small game to move the surface of the snow ringing its internal dinner bell. It had no such luck and eventually flew on.

We sat in our spot scanning the tree lines and used my buck grunt call every once and a while. We were trying to entice a mature buck our way. Hoping he would come to challenge our figment of a bigger buck, here to steal his haram of does. At one point, a lone doe and her baby that was most likely a yearling crossed about 300 yards in front of us. We just watched them and let them go on their merry way. We didn't have to say it to one another but something about this spot had gotten to us. If it wasn't a trophy buck, it wasn't worth the bullet.

The sun was high in the sky at this point. Time for a bit of food. I pulled out my thermos of coffee and poured some for Talon and I.

“Warm coffee, sitting in the trees hunting, nothing better hey?”  
“Except driving home with a deer in the back of the truck.” Talon said while laughing.

“Fair enough.” I laughed as well. “Hey, pass the jerky.”

We sat a while longer before eventually needing to stretch our legs. We were gathering our gear together to do a walk-about in the area. When we went to stand up, I looked down to grab my bag and when I did, my eyes tracked the tree line...there was a deer? My head snapped back up at what I thought I saw. There was nothing there but I swore I saw a deer's head half way up one of those trees. That didn't make any sense.

“Did you see that deer in that tree line?”

Talon was looking in a different direction with his binoculars. “No.” He swiveled to the tree line I was looking at scanning over it with his binos. “Nope not seeing anything...just a couple of yellow lights in the distance.”

“Yellow lights?” I pulled up my binoculars. “I can't see any.”  
Talon looked back through his looking glass. “Yeah right... huh. Must have been a lens flare.”

A chill went down my spine. Something was wrong. As we stepped out of our hiding spot I was just about to suggest that we should start making our way back to the truck when my mouth went dry and my knees almost gave out. What I saw I almost couldn't comprehend. I didn't have to ask Talon if he saw it as well as his gaze was locked onto the same spot.

Standing at the tree line, two-hundred yards to the right of where we had been looking, was a creature that stood bent over at the waist. My skin crawled as I stared at the thing peering out of the treeline through its yellow glowing eyes. As if it were a child peeking around a corner. Talon and I stared motionless at the creature staring back at us, it was also motionless in a kind of strange Mexican standoff of confusion and fear.

The creature had the face of a deer with large antlers, yellow glowing eyes, and an elongated neck. What could only be described as long black human hair was growing down from its head, almost touching its first elbow. The body looked much like a deer as far as the pelt went, but it looked patched together. Some of the patches were new, some old, and some of it was fur from other animals. I then saw patches that looked like skin...human skin? It was so thin you could see every bone and every distinct column of its spine. Its ribcage was set like a human's and I saw on one side, it had one human breast roughly stitched to itself. It had too many joints in its legs and arms; its feet were hooves but its hands... it had human hands. It flicked its tongue out in our direction, tasting the air. It was a serpent's tongue. The creature squinted its yellow glowing eyes and opened its mouth to reveal razor sharp multi rowed teeth like that of a shark. With its mouth fully open it made guttural noises then out of its mouth came “ HE... HEY... PSSS.. PA PASS ..THE JEK... it wailed like a demon being exorcised as if frustrated at the word. JERK... JERKY. Then in an instant it stood upright and disappeared into the treeline. When it stood its height was astoundingI t was at least 15 feet tall; half the height of the birch trees. My stomach dropped as I recalled the movement I saw from the truck.

We stood there staring at where the creature had been, our feet frozen to the ground, our bodies unwilling to move. As if we had stood there all winter and were nothing but frozen meat statues waiting for the spring thaw.  
Finally I shook the spell off, looked at Talons ghost white face, and through my dry mouth whispered, “What the fuck was that.” My head spun, the yellow lights...that thing had been watching us from the start.

In the distance now, in a different part of the trees, we heard something like Talon's voice, “I...ID... GUESS... TWENT...TWE...TWENTY MINUTES.”

It could move fast, too fast.

We crawled back slowly into our hunting spot, trying to keep our heads on straight and our breathing under control.

I repeated myself, “What the fuck, what the fuck was that?”

“I don't know...Fuck I don't know. How are we going to get out of here? That's the tree line we came in from.”

I peeked out of our hunting spot. He was right. About 100 yards to the left from where we saw the creature was the path that we had come out on. Shit.

We looked around but saw no other blatant entrance points though the trees. We were trapped. We had been funneled in and now there was only one way out. Somehow, we needed to get to that road and back to my rusty old Ford waiting like a beacon of hope just off the gravel road. I never thought of that old bucket of bolts more fondly than in that moment.

“Ok.” I said barely in a whisper, “We need to get to that path. Leave anything here that you don't absolutely need to be carrying. The faster we can move, the better.”

Lucky for us there was only light snow on the ground so we could run at a dead sprint with no problem, but the same advantage would be given to that...thing.

I continued,”We can hop from one small collection of trees to the next until we get to that last one over there.” I breathed out a shaky breath, “Then we can plan from there but I think it's going to have to be an all out sprint down the path from there. What do you think?”

Talon took a moment studying the terrain, eyes still wide with fear. “Yeah I agree.” He paused, “How many rounds did you bring in?”

I stared at him for a second,”Three” “Same,” he replied.

“Pick your shots wisely"" I said, directed at myself as much as him. I surveyed the area and the sun was starting to sink. “Let's go.”

We darted as quickly and quietly as we could from tree line to treeline. Stopping only to catch our breath and try to listen for movement or any other sound coming from the creature. Hard to do over your heart pounding in your ears not only from the running but also the pure adrenaline of fighting for your life. We had dumped most of our stuff at our first hunting spot, only keeping our rifles, skinning knives and wallets. We also ditched our blaze orange attire figuring if that thing could see color we would be better off in our camo shirts we had underneath.

We came to the second to last bunch of trees. We watched and waited and...GO. We ran. Half way to the last collection of trees the hair stood up on the back of my neck. I could feel it watching. Realizing I lost Talon beside me, I slowed turned back over my right shoulder. Talon was standing still, his Savage 30-06 raised. I could see him shaking and trying to keep the gun steady enough to take a decent shot. The creature stood just out of the treeline slightly behind us at around 300 yards out. I raised my Bergara 300 Win. Mag to meet the creature as well, shaking while I did so. We both pulled the trigger, mine slightly after his. My shot missed as the creature bent and contorted after being grazed by the first shot that skinned its outer arm. It growled and screeched looking at its long arm that had been injured, clasping the wound with one of its human hands. It snapped its head back to look at us and screamed. It sounded like a woman being skinned alive. Then it fell back into the treeline. 4 rounds left. We cycled our bolts and put a new round in the chamber. Talon caught up to me at a full run and didn't stop. I matched his pace as he ran by.

Through laboured breath I yelled, “Pass the trees! To the Path! Don’t Stop!” No arguments there.

We ran past the last bunch of trees checking over our shoulders from time to time while we ran. We came up to the opening of trees and as our feet hit the path to salvation we heard an unnerving version of my voice at a distance, “DON'T STOP, PASS THE TREE...S,DONT STOP.” It was getting better at mimicking us.

We ran down that path for what seemed like forever, adrenaline carrying us. We could see the trees starting to thin. “*Yes!*” I thought, “*We are almost there! We are almost out!*”. I could not wait to see that old ford and that gravel road. We blew through the opening almost in tandem like watching two olympic runners fighting for first place crossing the finish line. Our eyes adjusted to the light.

“No...” “NO!”

We were standing where, just hours earlier, we had stood looking through our binoculars picking a spot to hunt.

Talon looked at me, both of us huffing, our breath hanging in the cold air as clouds, steam floating off our bodies. “What...what the fuck! How is this possible? It was a straight path! What the...” He was cut off.

We both locked onto two yellow orbs floating in the collection of trees we had passed not long before while running from the creature. It was watching us from those same trees. We raised our rifles. I took my shot. The eyes disappeared. No sound from the creature. Talon held a bead on where the eyes had been but didn't fire. Three rounds left. I cycled my bolt. I had one round. Talon had two.

“You think I got him?” I said heedlessly. “No idea.”

Right. Dumb question. Like he would know if I killed the monster in the woods. As if we were still hunting for deer and not an abomination that hell itself spat out onto this plane of existence.

We tucked into the trees just off the path keeping an eye on where the creature had been and where it could be going. We were losing daylight. If you have ever been up north in the winter, the days are not very long. We could be in pitch black by 6 o'clock. We needed a plan and fast.

While keeping an eye on our surroundings we talked about what just happened. We ran down a straight path and somehow ended back where we started. What the hell do you do with that?

“What do you think we should do?” I said mind moving so fast I felt like I could take flight. “We do it again.” Talon responded

“Again?” I responded with a dumbfounded look on my face. “You know what they say about doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result.”

“Yeah yeah but we're not going to do it the same way.”  
“How can you run down a path differently?” I said sarcasm dripping off my words.

Talon picked up a small stick and whacked me in the head with it. “Pay attention dumbass.” He started to draw in the snow. I continued to watch the trees and field while he drew.

“We run just like before but this time watching our tracks.” He drew out a path with arrows as our tracks, “We each have a one set of tracks going out towards the truck and we each have two sets coming into the bowl"" he drew a horizontal line across where the tracks changed direction. “If we find where the tracks change direction that should be where the loop starts. Then if we go off the path into the woods and push through the trees we might be able to get out.”

My eyes searched his drawing. It was a loose theory but at this point with no other ideas and both of us not being well versed in time-space loops; we would have to roll the dice.

“Well hell, works for me.” I said, scratching my beard. My mind wandered to both our families we had left this morning. For the first time since this shit show started, I looked at Talon and said, “If I don't make it out, you let my family know what happened here and that we both fought like hell.”

“I'd ask the same of you.” Talon replied.

We exchanged wallets in the event one of us got out and the other didn’t. We wanted to be able to give them back to our wives as a gesture of going out in a fight together. It was all we had on us really and seemed to mean something at the time as silly as it sounds.

We both nodded, understanding our agreement. Live or die. We weren't going down easy.

We peeked out from our spot in the trees. Something rustled in the bushes just behind us, the wind picked up. It had a putrid smell, something long dead and rotting. Then a flash of yellow.

Time to go.

Talon and I hit the ground at a full sprint glancing down to check our tracks as we went. Talon checked over his shoulder.

“Shit!” he shouted. He dug his lead foot into the ground and spun, raising his rifle.  
I looked over my shoulder and watched as the thing, which was far too close for comfort, gained on us.

A shot rang out.  
Talon hadn't fully shouldered his rifle to look down his scope but as if in slow motion, I saw the creature's thigh ripple. He got him. Not a killing blow but it would hurt like hell and hopefully slow him down. “Yes!” I thought, “Good hit!""

The monster stopped in its tracks and looked at its new wound. We, however, did not stop. At full run Talon cycled his bolt. Two rounds left. “Keep going!” I yelled “Good hit! Good fucking hit!”

We ran, putting distance between the creature still standing and staring at its new hole in its thigh. We watched our tracks as we ran.

“Here!” Talon yelled. We hit where the tracks changed and skidded to a halt. Off in the distance the creature was barely visible and it slowly raised its head to look at us. I squinted as it opened its mouth and a new voice came out of it. One that it could mimic perfectly. A woman's voice.

“HELP ME! SOMEBODY FUCKING HELP ME! ANYONE! NO. PLEASE NO!”  
Its words echoed down the path and dissipated into the trees. We were not the first to come here.

“Come on!” Talon shouted from just inside the treeline. “Move your ass!”

I snapped back into my body, turned on my heels and ran behind him into the thick forest that was losing light by the minute. I cursed at the sun. Then I chortled to myself how stupid it sounded. As if it could hear me or as if it would care that I needed another hour or two of sunlight. Like it would stop doing what it had been doing since time began and God spoke it into existence.

We ran as fast as we could through the thick brush when my thoughts of the universe were cut short by that horrific scent and snapping branches close by.

Talon and I dove into different spots behind trees. I pressed myself up against and as far underneath a bigger downed tree as I could. I could barely make out Talon in his hiding spot. Good. I guess the darkness does have its benefits. We stayed still and tried to stifle our heavy breath. Like the worst game of hide and seek I had ever been a part of. My heart was beating so loud in my ears I thought the beast might hear it.

Silence. No birds to keep us company, no distant coyotes, no branches snapping. Utter grueling silence. A breeze crept through the trees. The scent was stronger, much stronger. It was nauseating. As I tried to keep my breakfast and coffee in my stomach, a creaking noise came from the log I was under. I looked with my eyes but didn't move my head as a large hand with overgrown, broken nails and fingers far too long with too many joints wrapped around the log. I shook as I turned my eyes skyward to look at the beast. The smell was unbearable at this point. I watched as the beast leaned just past the log looking forward, not at me but scanning the trees in front of me. It swayed from left to right looking slowly making low clicks and other quiet guttural noises. That's when it spotted something of interest, it stopped swaying and locked onto something tongue flicking out and in. I knew it was in Talon's direction. I raised my rifle pointing straight up. Said a quick prayer and pulled the trigger.

The shot rang. As did my ears. The beast fell backwards kicking and screaming. My ears were still ringing, the creature sounded distant although it was flailing right behind me. In the chaos, one of the beast's finger nails cut down my back from shoulder to ass leaving a decent wound. It didn't even register at the time.

Talon ran out of the dark into my view, grabbed the rifle out of hand and threw it to the side. I must have looked in a daze cause he slapped my face a few times before I registered him yelling at me, “MOVE YOUR FEET!”.

We ran into the trees pushing the wailing creature farther and farther behind us. A while later, maybe an hour? We fell out of the tree line into soft deep snow. We both looked around farmers fields and with the moon out we could see in the distance a gravel road. We had made it.

“No way...no fucking way!” Talon shouted, a smile creeping across his face. He was just as surprised as me not only had his plan worked but we were both still alive.

Although in rough condition from running through such thick woods with scrapes and gouges and my back cut open, we were both alive. We started making our way back to the truck as quickly as we could although the snow had gotten quite deep.

“The snow wasn't this deep when we got here,"" I said looking at Talon. “No, no it wasn’t.

Both of us had a sinking feeling in our gut. We moved a little faster through the snow. Then we came around the corner of the trees and there gleaming in the moonlight was the rusty old Ford. It lightened our spirits for a moment, but we noticed the truck had a good foot and a half of snow on it. We stumbled back to the truck. I fumbled my keys out and opened her up. Talon ejected his last full round and caught it. It was our last remaining life line. He stared at it for a moment then vomited beside the truck which made me do the same.

I put the key in and prayed she would turn over. The old display on the radio slowly came to life. I turned the key and after two turns I kicked the gas pedal. The old girl begrudgingly roared to life and Colter was back singing his song Thirteen Silver Dollars,  
“*It was a cold and cruel evening*

*Sneaking up on Speedy Creek*  
*I found myself sleepin' in the snow*  
*For one or two odd reasons*  
*I ain't too proud to repeat*  
*For now, we'll say I had no place to go...*

I patted the dash. “Thanks ol’ girl you never let me down.” The sound of my old truck running and my CD playing brought tears to my eyes.

We kicked a bit of snow off the truck but didn't spend time making her pretty, the faster we got out of here the better.  
As I was turning the truck around Talon reached into the glove box and pulled his phone out and booted it on. When the android logo disappeared, the time read 1:45am. December 13th. His battery had just enough juice to kick on, get to his lock screen and then die.

“December 13th”, I said, wanting to vomit again. What the hell happened. As we drove away down the gravel road I glanced in my rearview mirror. At two yellow lights dotting the path we had walked into that morning or... two weeks prior? I don't know anymore. The yellow lights got higher in the darkness and disappeared. I hit the gas harder and turned up the radio a little louder. I spaced out driving down the moonlit gravel road as Colter sang,

“*The sun is gone away now*  
*Green grass turns to brown*  
*Every December it gets a little bit harder To lay that bottle down*  
*It's more than just the weather*  
*That plagues this prairie town*

*But I won't be seeing you*  
*When I come 'round*  
*Every day it seems*  
*My whole damn life's just a codeine dream I don't dream of you anymore...”*

1oqh8fg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqh8fg,Nightingale is (still) not good :(,"Apparently I still haven’t learned my lesson because I couldn’t resist trying these new flavors of Nightingale Ice cream sandwiches when I saw them at a small local market. I’ve made posts before in this sub about what they get right and wrong in my opinion. I’ve seen others say the same about the texture of their ice cream being so gummy, weird, and a far cry from how the original version was before they expanded so far out of Richmond Virginia. These flavors looked interesting to me and I was again, hoping that I’d get lucky and pick up one that had a new recipe. I’ve noticed the Cookie Monster flavor is one of the best because it doesn’t seem to have as much of the gummy texture as the others. Maybe it has less fillers idk.

Most of the issue is obviously the poor ingredients used to preserve the ice cream but I also think the flavors aren’t executed well. “White chocolate chip blondie cookie with peppermint white chocolate coffee ice cream” is just…a lot for it to fall so flat. I think they should go back to their roots and focus on bringing the quality back to their brand even if it means scaling down to one or two basic flavors that hold up well in shipping and are actually a treat to eat. Please stop with the insane gums, it’s nasty. And these are too expensive to be so bad.

His reaction was not what I expected.,"My boyfriend is a software developer, and honestly, half the time he speaks a language I swear is part alien. He's always so passionate when he talks about his projects, his eyes lighting up as he explains some complex problem he solved. I love seeing him that happy, but I always felt like there was this huge part of his world I just couldn't access. For our anniversary, I decided I wasn't just going to buy him a new keyboard; I was going to step into his world.

So, for three solid months, I became a secret agent of code. After he went to bed, I'd sneak back to the living room, a conspiratorial grin on my face, and dive into Python tutorials. The first few weeks were brutal. I stared at my screen, surrounded by empty coffee mugs and a slowly growing pile of snack wrappers, feeling my brain melt. There was this one infamous night I spent six hours trying to fix a bug that was literally just a misplaced comma. I almost threw my laptop out the window. But then… the 'aha!' moment. That little spark when the code finally runs, and the thing you imagined actually appears on the screen. It was intoxicating.

I decided to build a simple text-based adventure game about our relationship. You’d answer questions about our first date, inside jokes, and favorite memories, and it would lead to a cheesy, heartfelt message at the end. As the anniversary approached, I was a nervous wreck. What if he thought it was dumb? What if he just saw all the rookie mistakes in my code? The night of, I handed him my laptop and just said, 'I, uh, made you a thing.'

He opened it, a little confused, and started playing. I watched him, barely breathing, as his expression shifted from curiosity to shock, and then to this huge, beaming smile. He didn't just play it; he right-clicked to 'view source' and started reading my messy, heavily commented code. I thought he was going to critique it, but he just looked up at me, completely floored. He wasn't just happy about the game; he was touched that I had put in so many hours to learn his language. He spent the next hour excitedly pointing out how I could refactor things, and for the first time, I actually understood what he was saying. It was, without a doubt, the best gift I've ever given.

I have been diagnosed with ADHD since I was 16 years old, but I was always hesitant to get medicated because I feel really weird on just regular coffee too (anxious, jittery, chest discomfort, etc.). I have recently found it increasingly harder to get out of bed or focus on anything, and the ADHD paralysis and procrastination has been bad enough that I might lose my job, so I decided to finally get medicated. I took my first dose this morning at 8 AM. I definitely felt like I could concentrate better, and got a lot of work done which is very unusual for me. I was able to work for 12 hours straight. I do have chronic migraines, but I rarely get 1 a month these days. However, I started getting a horrible migraine around 12 pm, and it kept getting worse so I had to take my migraine meds too, which for some reason didn't work (I don't know if its a regular headache instead of a migraine, or Vyvanse just gave me a horrible one?) I also started having chest discomfort, heart palpitations in the afternoon which I'm still feeling at 10 PM. I still feel really wired like I've had way too much coffee, and I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight. I thought this medication was supposed to start wearing off by now?

Other Info: I take PPI (pantoprazole) everyday for gastritis, monthly injection for migraines (Aimovig), and iron and vitamin D pills as I'm severely deficient.

My fiancee preordered them or else I would’ve gotten a completely different series of product entirely because I love SkullPanda but CryBaby makes me want to cry looking at it, and the other guys I’m just not a fan of, although the Molly one looks cute enough to where I’d probably keep it in this series! He didn’t understand that you don’t receive all different characters unless you purchase the case, I don’t really get why that is either especially if it’s preordered- they can’t just pull four from a single case or the different assembly lines so we aren’t spending our hard earned money on duplicates?!? PopMart is beyond reason and logic to me and he’s the only one who will even order from them. I order from reputable sellers on WhatNot. Anyhow, I promptly ripped all four open and got three of the hideous CryBaby plushies, one didn’t even contain a card. The SkullPanda is great and really adorable. Didn’t even get a Labubu! I definitely want a replacement for the one that didn’t contain a card because it makes it hard to resell and people doubt authenticity when you don’t have the card. The box had huge crowns on it, of course, and looked kicked around. One side was open enough to look in but everything was present besides any kind of packing list or receipt. There definitely wasn’t unboxing instructions to record! So after all this disappointment, I realized EVERY box had a yellow peel off sticker on the side that said what character was in it!!! Is this a new thing? I’m trying not to be enraged because that means that they are aware of which box has the secrets and also know when they send you three of the same damn character! I’m going to do a chargeback on them unless they are willing to replace the one without the card and give me something besides Cry Babies. The company lost 12billion overnight recently because stockholders are getting nervous about the company for legitimate reasons like they can’t keep inventory in stock, and they have no customer service resolution whatsoever when there are issues, etc. am I am asshole for thinking all of this?!?

1oqh200,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chi_FI_Gadgets/comments/1oqh200/42_moondrop_dawn_pro_2_the_tiny_dac_that_finally/,$42 MOONDROP Dawn Pro 2: the tiny DAC that finally makes cheap IEMs sing,"# $42 MOONDROP Dawn Pro 2: the tiny DAC that finally makes cheap IEMs sing

I grabbed the 'MOONDROP Dawn Pro 2' as a one-dongle-to-rule-them-all for my phone and laptop, and—honestly—it’s the first budget stick that didn’t feel like a compromise. On paper it brings 'dual Cirrus Logic CS43198' DACs, balanced + single-ended outputs, and the kind of clean headroom that lets modest IEMs strut like they cost more. In the hand, it’s featherlight, matte, and disappears in a pocket. In the ears, it’s 'ahhh…there it is.'

For context, my current daily IEMs rotate through a very down-to-earth cast—'TRUTHEAR HEXA', '7Hz Zero 2', 'SIMGOT EW300', and the humble 'MOONDROP Chu II'. Plug those into a phone’s stock adapter and they’ll *play*; plug them into Dawn Pro 2 and they *breathe*, especially on dense mixes and live takes where microdynamics and stage depth tend to collapse on weaker sources. That extra voltage swing keeps transients intact, cymbals less smeared, and bass lines round rather than woolly when you nudge volume up.

# What it really is (and why it matters)

The Dawn Pro 2 isn’t fancy for fancy’s sake. Dual 'CS43198' chips deliver quiet backgrounds and low out-of-band noise; decoding runs up to '32-bit/384 kHz PCM' and 'DSD256'; and output power is quoted at '124 mW + 124 mW @ 16 Ω' on the balanced jack—plenty for any sensible IEM and even a good number of portable headphones. There’s a '3.5 mm SE' for convenience and a '4.4 mm balanced' for when you want the grip and channel separation. On Android, the MOONDROP Link app sees the device (and exposes EQ/updates), which is rare at this price.

Price check: most stores list it around '$59.99 USD', so the '$42' sale I paid locally is a sweet spot. At that number, it undercuts a lot of weaker 'hi-res' sticks and beats the ubiquitous phone dongles on drive and channel control.

# How it changed my budget sets

'MOONDROP Chu II': suddenly more texture down low; sub-bass has a cleaner start/stop, and stage edges feel less hazy. 'TRUTHEAR HEXA': that soft-neutral tuning benefits from the extra current—toms feel taught, vocals sit a hair forward without grain. 'SIMGOT EW300': already lively; with balanced out it gets 'snap' without turning brittle. '7Hz Zero 2': tighter bass, less mid-bass bloom; imaging locks a bit more solidly. None of this is magic—just clean power and low noise letting good transducers do their thing.

# How it stacks up to the 'it’s good enough' dongles

Yes, the tiny stock USB-C adapters measure shockingly well…but they usually top out on drive and sometimes raise noise with low-impedance loads. Dawn Pro 2’s balanced stage buys you headroom and control that cheap adapters don’t, which you hear as 'microdynamic contrast' and 'stable imaging' at normal listening levels—not merely 'louder.' (Its predecessor line has a track record of solid measurements; Pro 2 ups the chip and output game.)

# The practical bits nobody tells you

'Battery & heat:' it sips more power than a stock adapter; on my phone it’s a non-issue for commutes, but you’ll notice on long sessions.

'Cables:' to use the better 4.4 mm output, you’ll want a balanced cable for your IEMs. Many Chi-Fi favorites offer easy cable swaps (2-pin/QDC/MMCX).

'Mic passthrough:' don’t count on inline microphone support unless the product page explicitly says so. Treat Dawn Pro 2 as a *listening* device first. (I didn’t see mic specs called out by vendors.)

# Good pairings under $100 (fun, not dogma)

If you’re building a tiny 'great everywhere' rig, I love these with Dawn Pro 2: 'TRUTHEAR HEXA / Zero:Red' for clean reference lines, 'SIMGOT EW300' for musical sparkle, 'Kiwi Ears Cadenza' for smooth all-day vibes, 'AFUL Performer 5' when you want sub-bass authority plus separation, and of course the 'MOONDROP' family (Chu II, Aria 2) for reliable tonality. If you want a curated list in one place, I usually send friends here: [DANKUNG Earphones](https://www.dankung.com/taxonomy/category-earphones_185?cp=dk10forum).

# Should you buy it at $42?

'Yes', if you want a just-throw-it-in-the-bag DAC that unlocks balanced drive, real headroom, and app support at coffee-money prices. Stick with your stock adapter only if you’re strictly single-ended, always listen quietly, and never push dense mixes. For everyone else—especially anyone pairing it with MOONDROP, TRUTHEAR, SIMGOT, 7Hz, LETSHUOER, THIEAUDIO, DUNU, KZ, Kiwi Ears, or AFUL IEMs—this is the little box that makes your existing gear feel upgraded.

1oqh17s,https://www.reddit.com/r/TargetedSolutions/comments/1oqh17s/the_health_bomb/,The health bomb,"Okay you're targeted, constant stress, mental terror at check. Do you also have your health in check? If you have a good health, your mind will become much more stable. You have more energy, are emotionally calmer, have higher mental facilities, are more wide awake and aware, need less sleep, have more positive and resistant mind states, no matter if you think you're ground down with mental terror or with external hardship, if you are healthy your chances to keep level will rise exceedingly. Good health, can make a difference between sleepwalking and being wide awake. So contemplate how well you can keep your body, and if keeping it better may rise your chances.

I smirked when I read the TISolutions thread with the lots of encouragement to eat healthy and do good for the bowels. Yeah, that's right, the fries, burgers and buritos will drain you my friend. See a person with unhealthy skin, lots of diseases, weak immune system? Probably bad nutrition. It could be fixed with healthy eating.

Now the bowels thing. The pinned post made me want to pick it up somehow... Yes, in the bowels is big ecosystem of germs and fungi. However it's composed, it will affect how and what enzymes and other substances from food will be available...with by products, and this can also change whole brain chemistry.

After realizing I was attacked again some years ago with constant mental terror illusions. I decided to give myself all the health boosts I could to keep resisting and keeping up my life. I started meditation, but most importantly I cut all that was draining me and got me down. I cut alcohol, nicotine, bad pharmaceutics (using meds only when it makes sense, but then freely, using widely accepted herbal remedies by preference). I cut bad entertainment that reinforces negative patterns (reality is much better to learn from, entertainment should uplift in a positive way), I started thinking about religion and the meaning of life, I stopped all porn use, I stopped mindless media distractions, rather learning and researching things than sit in front of TV. I stopped drinking lots of coffee, and later started using green tea instead. All illicit drug use, again I tell you, I decided to never again touch drugs from unknown sources, never again any black market substances. I got poisoned before multiple times, had to learn the hard way. Started doing phases of regular workout, building up all kinds of healthy activities, started engaging with people no matter how much the pressure in my head hurt, whenever I was ready to cope with it even at all. It were such hard years, but it was worth it so far, I don't look back but every little effort was worth it and helped saving my life.

Okay, and food. I really have a weird relationship to this, I always thought it was not so important. Then I started first vegetarism, then veganism. I made sure to do it right, eating craploads of veggies, legumes, grains every day, making sure plant protein is added in masses and B12 folate from pills every day. It is like a constant light fasting, and it make me feel more awake and revealed more of the mental influence immediately. This experience was years ago, and it made me realize that eating really changes that much. Just eating more vegetables, will make a big difference, all kinds of anti-oxidants and other substances in them constantly battle negative influences for the whole system in the blood stream.

The next revelation came to me when I just fasted for a week, with some preparation days of light food, then only (liquid) vegetable juice and a cup of salted broth every day for a week. Haha, it really restored my bowels as advertized, and I did to finally cut out all treats fatty foods and crisps out of my life. The change was immediate, even in the days with light food I already felt the difference - like a black cover lifted from my head making me more awake and aware. Each time such a thing happens, all the mental voices, abuse, visions etc. all fade, only what's positive stays, and I can feel a part of myself waking up and being with me all the time, which was missing before. The torment visions - just toned down, later adapted, but since that fasting the effect stayed until today. I immediately planned to regularly do that. Part of the effect, was for sure the system in my bowels being restored - I deliberately drank lots of tea and also probiotic substances with lactobacillus and yeast during this time. Such germs clear out all bad opponents in there permanently. Just if you continue to eat unhealthily, they might come back at some point and you slowly lose the effect, feeling drained again.



Okey enough of that bowel shit, just eat more veggies and less crap and treats, fast a time or two in a healthy way and you will see. The mindfunk I had - suddenly I woke up being aware of it again, and many programs started failing out on me.

If you're impatient, try to get a kicks out of this smoothie recipe I have for a quick fix. It's like a bang for the bucks recipe, and even tastes half decent. This also literally kicks through the trauma cloak and lets you feel yourself again - this helps breaking trauma intrusion based mind control, stuff just doesn't impress you any longer when you feel awake. It's rather cheap to get all ingredients in every store where I live, I drink one every morning, the second is for my wife or later. Do this, meditate, and I'll see you again. See health warnings at end before trying, some people have allergy or liver conditions and need to take care/replace ingredients.

The good morning grenade

for 700ml \~ 2 portions

* 100g apple
* 100g banana
*  75g celery stalks or another veggie like broccoli or summer squash
*  15g green celery green or green spinach, salad leaves or other edible green leaf
*  10-15g linen seed
* 1-2cm fresh peeled ginger (or 1/2 tsp ginger powder)
* 1-2cm fresh peeled turmeric (or 1/2 tsp turmeric powder)
* 1/4-3/4 tsp green tea (matcha) powder (optional)
* 100ml lemon juice
* 2-3 Tbsp (20-40g) hemp protein powder or other plant protein powder (optional, makes a thick drink)
*  1 pinch of salt (electrolytes)
* 1/4 tsp cinneamon
*  2 pinches cardamon
*  1 pinch ground cloves
* 1 tsp - 1 tbsp maple syrup or other sweetener (if you need quick energy)
*  2 fresh mint leaves (optional, for a little fresher taste)
*  1/4 tsp ground black pepper, a pinch of Chili powder or a squint tabasco (for activating the turmeric)
*  fill the blender up with clean water (should be around 200-300ml)
*  you can also add the flesh of a passion fruit, to make it taste much better and get some extra vitamins

Chop it all & put it into a blender and blend finely, then you can drink 2 portions of it. I didn't calculate the calories yet - the effect however is strong. It is not really a drug, but just cheap healthy things combined, it works massively anti-inflammatory and anti-depressant (celery, ginger, turmeric) with anti-oxidants (green tea, apple, salad, green tea), preventing thrombosis (ginger), giving nutrition and vitamins and potassium (lemon juice, apple, banana), a mild stimulant (green tea), and bowel-restoring and protecting substances (greens, linen seed, and all fibers contained). The rest is just for the taste. You could add even more substances, but this one is already magnificient. You may see, if you do it for the first time and you're used to feeling rather sick, it may even feel uncomfortable, like too much life coming back to you from this. I believe it's way more potent (and healthy) than coffee to get you wide awake, and it works much more reliably and enduringly. It's real weird, not like a drug, but it just hypes you up and makes you feel present all time in a natural way, and makes you feel as if your body is soft and pleasantly glowing due to turmeric & ginger having good synergy.

The health warnings: it's all just standard food ingredients from groceries...but celery can cause allergy for some, make sure you're not affected, leave away. Ginger works like aspirine slightly diluting the blood - make sure you've no condition which makes this dangerous. The turmeric may impact the liver if given daily in high doses or with precondition - leave away or dose low if your condition demands. Green tea contains caffeine, you can leave it away and use other antioxidant powders like moringa or barley grass. Try not to ingest more raw linen seed per day than the 15g, and take care if your digestion allows these seeds - if you take more than that in raw state, the hydrocianic acid can build up, but it's only traces afaik.

Like I say I keep the ingredients cheap, and I try to also ingest other things with similar properties throughout the day. The bananas and celery I buy when in discount, peel and chop and freeze the bits in bags, to get my fill every day & have the smoothie nice cold to drink right away. Lemon juice in bottles, the green tea powder can be the cheapest but take care there's no greater heavy metal or aluminium traces in it if you do it daily.

Okay enough for today. Hope this helps somebody getting bad stuff out of their system and wake up again. Don't give it up, just keep swimming until you rise above water level. Persons with heart and integrity, are like signal buoy for society. They are supposed to swim in front of others so all know what's safe and where danger starts. You can push them down with weight as much as you want. As soon as they are freed, they will shoot back up to the surface. Free yourself from all unhealthy crap, and one day you can maybe also be like that. Don't worry if it takes time, take your time - change your life step by step, one project after the other. Each project you fail, work it out, research it thoroughly, record your personal reasons to remember when it counts. Keep trying again each time you fail as long as you're sure a thing's worth it. After time, the changes can sum up and make you propel back to life. I've done this being deep down and constantly tyrranized in my mind.

Things started out really good, but lately we’ve been fighting a lot about my relationship with my best friend — who also happens to be my ex.

For context, my ex and I dated years ago but we’ve been friends for a long time, even after the breakup. She’s one of the few people who really understands me, and we’ve kept a close bond. We hang out, grab coffee, and talk about games — it’s always been platonic since we broke up.

My girlfriend says I prioritize my best friend over her. I admit that I sometimes cancel plans or adjust schedules depending on my best friend’s availability, but it’s not because I care less about my girlfriend — it’s just that my best friend has been in my life for years, and I don’t want to lose that friendship over misunderstandings.

She’s also bothered that my best friend sometimes sleeps over (for convenience, not intimacy), and that I check with her before planning some things. I can see why that feels wrong from the outside, but it’s not like I’m choosing one over the other.

I just feel stuck — like no matter what I do, I’m either a bad boyfriend or a bad friend. I don’t want to cut my best friend out of my life, but I don’t want to hurt my girlfriend either.

1oqgys4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismTranslated/comments/1oqgys4/high_functioning_autism/,High functioning autism!,"I was diagnosed with High-Functioning Autism (used to be known as Asperger's,) ADHD, and FND (formally known as Conversion Disorder,) social anxiety, and depression. I just started a new job at Starbucks and I suck. I've been there for three weeks. I drop everything, I don't understand half the things they tell me to do, I can't remember anything, and I have to get them to show me how to do something multiple times. If they put me on the bar, I immediately forget every drink and freak. I almost blended a frap without the lid last week. But I will say I've had a total of 2 hours on the bar and that is it. 

I feel like an idiot. My pen wasn’t working today and I didn’t know if it was just stopped up or out of ink so I set it back in the pen holder (it was the only one in there) to see if I could get it to work when we weren’t so busy, and a co-worker was like “throw it away if it’s out of ink, don’t put it back in there.” 

The other night I had a car at the window and I was waiting on drinks. I was asked “hey, do you have a car.” I said, “yeah.” Thinking she meant did I personally have a car. She then said, “no, one you are taking care of.” I looked at the camera to see if a car was at the drive through and said “no,” completely negating the one at the window which meant yes, I very well had a car. 

I was asked to get a cube of Strawberry Açaí for the first time and literally thought when grabbing the little box, surly this is concentrated and needs to be diluted, only to find out they meant the big cube with the purple lid. I felt like an idiot!

My shift lead told me to get with her and that I was Customer Support. I know what Customer Support is, so when she said get with her I thought she had something specific she wanted done. I went to her and she ushered me away just repeating Customer Support. I did not understand. Why tell me to get with you if you just wanted me on Customer Support?

Today, after my break my manager asked if I could keep an eye on front taking orders. Then after, my shift lead said I was Customer Support. Any other time I have tried to do two things at once while on CS I have been told to focus on Customer Support. So I thought I was just CS. Well this time they wanted me to do both but I was told by two different people at two different times. I even asked a co-worker, Who was watching front because I was put on Customer Support only to find out it was me. 

Today I also was told to work on dishes during CS (same shift lead,) then right as I started I was told to empty the trash and that I need to watch it. It looked full because of the milk bottles but then my manager who was making coffee pushed it down and it wasn’t even half full. I asked her if she still wanted me to empty it and she looks at it and says no. I go back to dishes only for her to come tell me that we don’t usually focus on dishes during peak hours. I felt so confused and like a literal chicken with my head cut off!

Some are really nice and answer all my stupid questions and deal with me with patience. But I could tell my shift lead was annoyed today. 

I just feel so stupid! I don’t want to be the one crying “oh it’s my autism, oh it’s my ADHD.” I just wanna show up, do my job correctly, and get paid. 

Any Advice? I’m gonna get fired!",3,1762478066.0,AutismTranslated,2,1.0,False
1oqgxq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1oqgxq6/hr_milos_eyes/,[HR] Milo’s Eyes,"Last night, like most nights recently, I had to work late. Seated in my semi-comfortable office chair, I stared at three harshly lit monitors for what ended up being, net of short breaks, just around 12 hours. Coffee in, bathroom out, let Milo in, let Milo out, repeat. The kind of day where even your breath feels tired. Usually, these days fade in and away just the same, but last night was different.

After making dinner, I ran my chicken wrap to my desk, placing it in front of the harsh light of my monitors before springing out of my room, back passed the kitchen, and to the back door, where Milo was surely waiting for me to let him in. Milo is a corgi with sleek, black hair and peculiarly long whiskers that curl up a bit at the ends, despite their vast thickness. Milo had eyes like no other; they were consumed by black but had a way of bouncing the light off them to reveal a subtle sparkle.

When I opened the door, Milo wasn’t perched in front of the opening where I had expected him to. I swung my head up from the ground in front of me to see Milo at the far end of the yard, staring at the lone oak tree just before the property line. The moonlight from above reflected off his fur coat and shined brightly on the ground before him. The tree he was fixated on must be 100 years old by the looks of it, the branches have grown thin and tired, and the bark is nearly all peeled away, lying on the grass, with Milo’s moonbeam highlighting the tree’s despair.

“Milo,” I called softly. He didn’t move. Not even a twitch of the ears. I offered treats, coaxed him with my voice, but he stayed fixed on that tree. Eventually, I left him out, figuring he just needed a minute more.

Before getting back to work, I gave my two cats, Jet and Spike, some affection. I lay with them for a while on the floor in between my bed and desk. The layout of my small, blue room is simple. To the left of the door is my desk, which stretches from the door to the corner, then, stuffed in the opposite corner, is my bed. At the foot of my bed is Milo’s bed, and the cats sleep with me at my feet. The house, all in all, is small, but comfortable in its clutter: plants, candles, and the faint hum of electronics bleeding into silence. The quiet felt heavier than usual, though I couldn’t tell why.

After pondering why I do the job I do and contemplating just going to sleep, I got up from the floor and ate my wrap before working through a couple more hours before exhaustion took over. I didn’t get ready for bed or anything; I simply got up from my chair, stumbled three feet to my bed, and collapsed.

I woke up around one in the morning to the sound of one of the cats scratching at the door, presumably trying to get out. I tilted my neck up to point my eyes in the direction of the door, looked into the darkness, unable to make out anything, and made a shushing noise. I then closed my eyes and drifted back asleep, thoughtless, as the scratching came to a halt.

I woke up one more time that night, around three. This time, I sprang awake to a noise coming from the front of the bed. Both Jet and Spike were present, curled up in their usual spots at my feet, but both were fast asleep. The sound that awoke me started again. It was the sound of Milo whining at the foot of my bed. This is a normal occurrence, so without a thought, I began to sit up to see what was wrong. The whimpering began to get more intense the further I adjusted myself.

Reluctant to make Milo happy so I could get some sleep, I did the usual, I lay out with my head at the foot of the bed and hung my right arm down to give Milo comfort without having to do any real work. The whimpering subsided a little bit. I could feel Milo’s wet nose and scratchy whiskers rubbing on my arms and the back of my hand. I closed my eyes and started to fall asleep, but just as Milo’s whimpers finally stopped, the thought occurred to me. I realized that I had forgotten Milo outside.

I immediately shot up in bed, the room went silent, I couldn’t see anything, and I didn’t know what to do. I reached around for something to defend myself with. Jet and Spike were now awake at this point. Who was at the foot of my bed? What was at the foot of my bed?

After shaking for what felt like hours with a copy of Edgar Allen Poe: The Complete Collection in my left hand, I built up the courage to leap from the bed to the light switch next to the door, so as to ensure I wouldn’t be fighting blind. Preparing to see a long, slender, thin creature or a monstrously ugly beast, I winced as the light filled the room. My eyes quickly jolted to the foot of my bed before making their way around the rest of the room. It was empty. I even checked under the bed.

Trembling, I slowly moved my arm behind me to twist open the door whilst still facing the rest of the room, gripping the doorknob just hard enough as not to break it. I didn’t want to take my eyes away; I knew that if I looked elsewhere, I might not be so lucky as to see nothing. I didn’t want to turn around and run. What if it was right behind me? After a few seconds, I had a ‘fuck it’ moment and decided to run. I sprinted through the kitchen and right out the back door, where the moon still shone bright, maybe even brighter than before.

Milo still wasn’t waiting to be let in, but rather was still at the far end of the yard, staring at that lone oak tree. He was in the same spot, unmoved, almost as if he was still taking the same breath as he was hours before. I started to move slowly from beneath the rickety doorway into the yard and towards my dog. As I got closer, the wind picked up. Leaves and bits of bark swirled through the air like ash. Milo’s body was trembling, his breathing uneven, almost pulsing. I ran the last few steps and knelt beside him. When I touched his shoulder, his head snapped toward me.

A The face that looked back wasn’t Milo’s—not entirely. This was a different version of Milo, one with the same fur coat and whiskers as Milo, but different eyes. The eyes of the version from those moments last night had no sparkle; they were the eyes of a man. They were blue and watery, with a thin white film coating their surface, giving them a sort of foggy appearance. I will never forget the stark contrast between the black fur and those sad, blue eyes. Those eyes looked through me, not at me.

But just as quickly as it had started, it had also passed. The wind died. The yard fell still. And then, like nothing had happened, Milo’s eyes diverted back to their original state and the sparkle returned to his eyes.

Inside, I set him down in the hallway so I could freely open my bedroom door. I gripped the doorknob tightly again, but this time the door wouldn’t budge. It was locked from the inside. Shocked, I stepped back from the door and from Milo. I could here the cats scratching at the door, begging to come out. But of course, now I had to wonder if that was really them.

The sound of sharp claws digging deep into the hardwood door echoed deep into my ears. Milo began to cry and bark at the door. My eyes began to burn, and my limbs went numb. I felt cold and lightheaded. And just as I thought I was about to pass out, I heard the whisper of a man say “hush”, followed by the clicking of the door’s lock. The animals fell silent once more.

I swung open the door, filling my peripheral vision all at once. Again, nobody was there. But this time, not even the cats. I checked every nook and cranny of the room, and then eventually the house too. I couldn’t find either one of the cats anywhere. I wish this were all just a bad dream. I have been sitting here upright in my bed since last night, deciding what I should do.

Milo keeps on staring at me. All I can see are those eyes.",1,1762477984.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1oqgvr7,https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/1oqgvr7/driving_to_mass_general_from_virginia/,Driving to Mass General from Virginia,"Hi!

On Wednesday morning I have an appt at Mass General downtown. I live in suburban Washington DC.  I'm not allowed to fly, so I am driving up Tuesday.  The hotel prices in Boston that day are high and the parking fees are usurious (like pretty much any city hotel). So I've decided to stay in Marlborough where there's a nice Hyatt Place that's clean, quiet, and no parking fees. 

My appt is at 10:15am.  To play it safe, I'm planning to depart the hotel at 6:45am, grab a bagel and coffee somewhere, then commute in.  

Here's where I please need your help! 

Should I take route 2, route 3, or I-90? I'll have plenty of time. So I'm looking for the route most likely to be consistent and, well, least annoying. Or put another way, if you were in Marlborough and had to get to Mass General, which route would you take?

Many thanks!!",30,1762477833.0,boston,96,0.78,False

|Office Jesus Turns Water Into Coffee By [Brian Briggs](mailto:briggsb@bbspot.com)|

Lufkin, TX -  The workers of Selby Communications are happy once again this morning, as their Office Jesus worked his miracles with the coffee machine. 

Every morning for the past three years Jesus has been making coffee and sharing his words of wisdom with the people of Selby Communications.  ""Fellow workers, we have a mission today to get broadband services to my children of east Texas.  Drink of this coffee, it is my blood.  Eat of these bagels they are my body.  Now go out there and sell, sell, sell""

""The blood part kinda creeps me out,"" says co-worker Avery McPhail, ""but it's damn good coffee.  I love his Sumatran-Mocha blend.""

Before Jesus arrived Selby Communications was a coffee-less company with only $2.3 million in sales.  Now the coffee is flowing and they are approaching $78 million.   All thanks to Jesus.  These facts haven't gone unnoticed by company executives who promoted Jesus to VP of Coffee Making and Security. 

President Henry Thomas said, ""I think we hired him as a security guard originally.  I saw him tinkering with the coffee machine one morning and told him that it hadn't worked for years, that it would take a miracle for it to start working again.  The next thing I know I've got a hot cup of Ethiopian blend and I'm loving it.""



*Selby Communications is a privately held company, which sells broadband and wireless services in East Texas and parts of Louisiana.*",2,1762477648.0,GenX,3,0.67,False
