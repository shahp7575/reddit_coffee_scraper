1n5f1vl,https://www.reddit.com/r/uAlberta/comments/1n5f1vl/how_to_make_a_friend_at_university_a_complete/,"How to Make a Friend at University - A Complete, No-Drama Guide - Guide for first year students","In this post I'll show you almost every practical way to make a friend at university: where to meet, what to say, when to swap contacts, how to send micro-invites, and how to lock it in with simple weekly rituals. I'll also give realistic timelines: with 10 minutes of social effort a day, most people meet a first real friend in 7-10 days, and a small circle forms in 4-8 weeks.

Why you shouldn't worry: you are not late - ""social onboarding"" runs all semester; most first-years feel shy and are waiting for someone else to start; small daily steps beat big awkward pushes; if you missed events, you’re fine - there will be plenty of chances; and the guide below has copy-paste scripts so you can act today.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**0) First, relax: you are NOT late**

* **Rule:** Social onboarding runs all fall and winter, not just Week of Welcome.
* **Reality:** Most friend groups form after 4-8 weeks once people figure out who fits their vibe.
* **Strategy:** Daily micro-steps beat ""find a best friend today"".
* **Leverage:** You already win by having a plan. Most people improvise.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**1) Where and when to look - the ""hunter map""**

Pick 2-3 streams and focus there.

**Academics**

* Before/after lectures (1-3 minutes at the door)
* Labs/tutorials (ask or offer tiny help)
* Libraries: Cameron before 10:00, Education North 4th floor is quiet

**Social spaces**

* Clubs: sign up for 5, stay active in 2
* Residence: open door in week 1, shared kitchens
* Gym, intramurals, board games, chess, gaming rooms

**Online**

* Faculty/course Discords, your school's subreddit
* Course group chats (ask classmates for links)

**10-minute rule:** 10 minutes of active socializing per day -> after 2 weeks you'll have 1-2 ""warm contacts"".

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**2) Low-cringe openers**

**AAA formula: Acknowledge -> Add -> Ask.**

* Line before class: ""*Hey, are you also in \[course\]? I'm still figuring out rooms.* **(Acknowledge)** *I usually sit near the aisle because I sprint to the next class.* **(Add)** *Have you had this prof before?* **(Ask)**""
* In lab: ""*I think we're in both \[174/114\].* **(A)** *I'm making a tiny study pod this weekend: 1 hour -> 3 problems -> done.* **(A)** *Want to join?* **(Ask)**""
* In residence: ""*Hi, I'm from \[room/floor X\].* **(A)** *I just made tea in the shared kitchen.* **(A)** *Want a cup and 5 minutes to chill?* **(Ask)**""

**Copy-ready English:**

* ""*Hey, are you also in \[course\]? I'm still figuring out the rooms. I usually sit near the aisle. Have you had this prof before?*""
* ""*We're putting together a tiny study group (1 hour, 3 problems, done). Want in?*""

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**3) Moving to contact exchange**

Use a concrete reason.

* ""*Can I grab your IG/Discord? I'll send notes/shortcuts.*""
* ""*Let's make a mini chat for \[course\]. I can create it and add you.*""

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**4) The friendship funnel**

1. **T0 First touch** \- 1-3 minutes of small talk.
2. **T1 Micro-invite (24-72h)** \- coffee 15 min, 2-3 problems, quick walk.
3. **T2 Repeat** \- second short meet in the same week.
4. **T3 Upgrade** \- small group of 3-5: study hour, board game, quick meal.
5. **Anchor** \- one ""anchor person"" you see 1-2 times weekly.
6. **Circle** \- anchors converge into a stable mini-circle.

**Metric:** no second meet within 2 weeks -> let it cool and move on.

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**5) Invites that get yes-es**

* ""*15-minute coffee before \[course\] today/tomorrow, 10:30 at SUB?*""
* ""*I'm stuck on problem 3. Want to go through it for 30 minutes after class?*""
* ""*Sunday I'm doing '1 hour -> 3 problems -> done.' 16:00, Cameron LL. Join?*""

**Yes-ladder:** offer 2 time options and a low commitment (15-60 minutes).

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**6) What to talk about**

**Topics:** courses/profs/campus hacks, city/food/winter/transit, hobbies (sports, games, music, shows), goals (internship, clubs).

**Techniques:**

* **THREAD:** pull 1 detail -> ask 2 follow-ups.
* **PARA-sharing:** 1 short fact about you -> 1 question.
* **Callback:** message later about something they mentioned (""how was that lab/meeting?"").

  
\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
**7) If you're introverted or anxious**

* **2-minute rule:** act for 120 seconds (say hi, send DM, ask) then exit.
* **Honesty script:** ""I'm usually quiet but want to meet a couple people. Mind if I sit/work here?""
* **Weekly micro-goals:** 3 conversation starts + 1 micro-meet.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**8) Texting cadence**

* **Timing:** message within 24h after first contact; then 1-2 pings or invites per week.
* **Message shape:** Hook -> Specifics -> Time/place -> Choice of 2. ""I have a clean Week 1 summary -> can share or explain. SUB 12:30 or 16:10 for 20 min?""

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**9) Handling no's and silence**

* No reply in 48-72h -> switch format (shorter invite, different reason/time).
* Two declined or ghosted invites -> stop pushing; keep it warm with a quick ""good luck on the midterm!"".

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**10) Locking in friendship**

* **Rituals:** 1 recurring thing per week (pre-class coffee, Sunday study hour, Friday match).
* **Memory:** jot 3 facts about them (hometown, course, hobby) for easy callbacks.
* **Small favors:** share photos of notes, ask how X went. Cheap but high impact.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**11) Boundaries like an adult**

* **Time:** ""*I only have 30 minutes today, deadline's tight.*""
* **Money:** ""*I'm budgeting right now. Let's walk and chat instead of a cafe.*""
* **Drama:** avoid third-person gossip early; pivot: ""*Not my topic, want to talk \[course/game\]?*""

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**12) Green and red flags**

* **Green:** keeps plans, messages first sometimes, proposes options, remembers details.
* **Red:** chronic late/cancels, only asks for help, toxic jokes, boundary push.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**13) 7-day starter plan**

* **Day 1:** 2 short doorway chats + 1 contact exchange (Discord/IG).
* **Day 2:** invite to 15-min pre-class coffee.
* **Day 3:** message contact #2 and propose ""1 hour -> 3 problems"" for the weekend.
* **Day 4:** join 1 club/chat and post an intro.
* **Day 5:** micro-help: ""Want my summary/shortcuts?""
* **Day 6:** host a tiny meet (2-3 people). Snap 1 photo for memory.
* **Day 7:** lock ritual: ""Same next week? Wed or Sun?""

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**14) Copy-paste message templates**

**Course chat intro:**  
""*Hey everyone, I'm \[Name\], first-year \[major\]. Building a tiny study pod: 1 hour -> 3 problems -> done. Sunday 4pm, Cameron LL. Ping me if you want in.*""

**DM after first talk:**  
""*Nice meeting you today in \[course\]. I have a clean Week 1 summary - want me to send it? I'm grabbing a 15-min coffee before class tomorrow, want to join?*""

**Follow-up if they were busy:**  
""*All good if you're swamped. I'm running the same 1-hour session Thu 6pm or Sun 4pm. Pick either, zero pressure.*""

**Soft boundary to an energy drain:**  
""*Hey, my schedule's packed so I can't help regularly. I can share a list of resources though if that helps.*""

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**15) Door checklist before you head out**

* Phone charged, 2 backup topics on a note
* Plan: 1 opener -> 1 contact exchange -> 1 micro-invite
* Breathe. A friendly smile, not a forced one. 120 seconds of courage is enough.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**16) Optional social hang for drinkers/vapers/cannabis (English)**

**Rule**: only if it's legal for you and allowed where you are (in Alberta the legal age is 18). Follow campus rules and use designated areas.

**Reality**: low-key, short hangs work best. No pressure, no hard sell, and always offer a sober alternative.

**Quick scripts (*****copy-paste*****):**

\- ""*We're grabbing a coffee/beer after class at 5 near SUB. Join for 20-30 min?*""

\- ""*Heading to the designated smoking area by \[landmark\] for a 10-min vape chill after lab. Want to join?*""

\- ""*If you're 18+ and comfortable: low-key cannabis hang off-campus after class at \[time\]. Down to chill for half an hour?*""

\- ""*We're pulling 2-3 people for a quick chill at \[place\]. If you'd prefer just us two, that's cool too.*""



Boundaries and safety:

\- ""*All good if you're sober or not into it. Happy to just walk or grab bubble tea.*""

\- Keep it short by default (15-45 min). Make it easy to say yes.

\- Know your limits, bring water, plan transit/ride-share. Don't bring substances into campus buildings.

\- If they decline or go quiet, pivot kindly: ""No worries at all. Want to do a quick study block instead?""



# TL;DR

\- 10 minutes of social effort daily

\- **AAA** opener: **Acknowledge -> Add -> Ask**

\- Contact within 24h -> micro-invite (15-60 min)

\- 2 meets in 7-10 days -> high friendship odds

\- Weekly ritual cements the circle",1,1756700284.0,uAlberta,0,1.0,False

1n5f1px,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1n5f1px/troubles_in_a_young_marriage/,Troubles in a young marriage," Okay a little background, I m30 am married to a f30 and we have been together a little over six years, married for 4. 

At the start of our relationship, I was not a good partner, I was coming off a really bad relationship where the girl I was engaged to had her dad die, wasn’t pretty, cancer ate him up until he looked like a corpse, even before he was dead, him and I were close. 

I waited a few months (not long enough in retrospect) and started dating my now wife. 

She fought really hard for me while I was basically a piece of shit, smoking way to much weed, staying out late, bought a car I had no business owning just because I could afford it, did drugs all sorts of bad shit. 

I was really lazy, even up until about two years ago. 

 Now I’m working two jobs to kind of make up for the time I lost being a shitbag, I help around the house, etc. 

My wife has a mental disorder, BPD, she was unmedicated up until about last year and it was hard, she once got mad I didn’t remember her coffee order, and didn’t talk to me for thee solid days. 

Once she’s been medicated things have gotten better

But lately, as in the past six months, she comes home after work (she starts at 4 am, is home by around 3-4pm) and getting her up out of bed, or even getting her to stay awake is nearly impossible, if I don’t force her to get up, she wouldn’t even eat. 

She’s been seeing a psychiatrist, and we moved out to her parents place because we are supposed to eventually inherit the house. 

I am very badly ADHD (legitimately diagnosed since I was 12) and hyper fixate on topics and will talk for a long time about history and other weird oddball stuff. 

She used to listen and ask me questions, etc 

Now I feel like she’s just always waiting for me to shut up. 

Even though I work two jobs. One full time. One part time, help clean around the house, etc it just feels like she’s honestly tired of me. 

I can’t really blame her, after what I put her through in the beginning, but I feel like I’m watching the woman I love slip away in real time, when I try to talk about it, she Insists everything is fine. 

I’ve been feeling like lately, the kindest thing to do is just save a few paychecks, and give her the option for a no fault divorce, just get back in my car like I did when I was 24, and drive somewhere new, find a place to quietly live out my penance for being a piece of shit, find a quiet place to curl up and proverbially die. 

I guess I’m just sort of at my wits end, I know I haven’t been a good man, and maybe I won’t ever be, but every morning when my feet hit the floor, I try my hardest to be a good man, some days are good, some aren’t, I’ve just kind of accepted that this is my cross to carry.

I guess I’m posting this to ask, am I being dramatic? Or would it be the best thing to just let her go? ",1,1756700268.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

""I wonder why we can see them and you guys can't?"" Evie asked softly. 

""I've been wondering that as well..."" Anton responded. 

""Maybe figuring that out will help us destroy them faster."" Detective Bright added. 

""Where would we even start looking for them?"" Detective Perry asked fearfully. 

""The one at the station disappeared in the woods behind the station.""Captain Bailey said thinking back on the destruction at the station. 

""The one that killed the girl...I think it disappeared into the drainage ditch."" Evie said trembling, her headache growing and her face tingling.

""The drainage ditch? If I'm not mistaken the one by the new construction site empties out in the Fairway River."" Detective Perry said. 

""Yes, and it runs through the Fairway Forest."" Detective Bright said narrowing her eyes. 

""So, that's where the monsters are hiding, in the Fairway Forest?"" Stella asked softly. 

""We're going to find out but we need to plan this properly... Hunting for them without a real plan will just lead to certain death."" Detective Bright added with everyone but Julio agreeing. 

""I don't care what y'all do. I ain't got nothing to do with this sh*t!"" Julio protested but everyone ignored him. 

""First things first, figuring out why we can see them and no one else can...Once we know that maybe we can make them visible to others."" Anton said. 

Hours ticked by as the group threw out different suggestions on what made Anton, Evie, Detective Bright and Julio different from everyone else. Nothing about them matched lifestyle wise or health wise adding to their confusion. Evie suggested their eyes might be made differently than others, while Julio relayed that his religious grandmother believed some people had a special, spiritual sight. Detective Bright suggested they all should get their eyes checked at the optometrist clinic connected to the hospital. Suddenly, Evie grabbed her head as a sharp pain soared through the right side blinding her. She fell from her chair as the world around her became blurry and everything went to black. 

""Evie, are you still in pain?"" Anton asked softly.

Evie stirred uncomfortably before opening her eyes slowly. She was in a hospital bed in a small ER exam room. An IV dripped saline and two other small packs of unidentified medicine into her arm. She could see Detective Bright and Perry in the hallway through the small door window. 

""What happened?"" She asked as Anton assisted her in sitting up. 

""You passed out during the meeting. You were out 11 hours..."" He responded with a concerned tone. 

""11 hours! Where are Max and Stella?"" She asked surprised. 

Anton explained Max and Stella had been taken back to different hospital rooms with extra security. The hospital was on high alert and The Figure's rampage was being called an isolated attack. He also explained that Evie had been taken for an MRI and her medical history had been provided by her roommates and a phone call to her mother who lived in another state. Evie was thankful but worried. The door opened and a short, attractive, south Asian doctor walked in. 

""Hello Ms. Walker, I'm the ER physician Dr. Bedi on call today. I have your MRI results.""

Evie sat up and listened intently with Anton grabbing her hand. 

""Your roommates and mother told us that you've experienced severe migraines since you were an adolescent. We noticed on your scan there were a few white brain matter lesions of the frontal lobe. Don't worry! This is not uncommon among people that suffer with severe migraines..."" He explained. 

""What should I do? Will it get worse?"" Evie asked frightened. 

""The most important thing is to control the migraines through medicine and try and reduce stress. I know that's difficult right now."" Doctor Bedi said sympathetically. 

Anton and Evie listened to him explain a few more things and medication options before he excused himself. Evie sat quietly in bed and turned to look out the small window. Morning had come again. 

""Don't worry Evie. Actually, I have lesions on my brain as well. I had a bad head injury from falling out of a tree in middle school. Knocked myself clean out and hit my head. I fully recovered but apparently it left a few lesions on the white brain matter."" He said smiling softly. 

Evie remained quiet as a thought struck her. She asked Anton to bring Detective Bright into the room. Detective Bright and Detective Perry arrived looking exhausted holding cups of coffee. After asking Evie explained her theory and asked Detective Bright if she had any prior head injuries that led to brain lesions. Detective Bright seemed taken aback by the question but sheepishly admitted that she hadn't had any brain injuries but during her early 20s she struggled with severe depression. During a checkup her psychiatrist ordered an MRI where they discovered a few brain lesions. 

""Captain Bailey said that Julio not only sold but used to take drugs as well. I know for a fact that can f*ck a brain up quickly!"" Anton added. 

I read about that in my Sociology of Addiction class...It's called toxic leukoencephalopathy. It's caused by continuous drug use or exposure. It causes damage...lesions to the white brain matter..."" Evie trailed off. 

""Damn. We found our connection, why we can see them! We might not be crazy, just got messed up brains."" Anton added looking at Evie. 

""What do we do with this information? It's not like we can cause brain damage to others?!"" Detective Perry griped. 

""True, but if we are correct we can find others that can see them too. Then, we can hunt them down."" Detective Bright responded angrily.

However, Dudley says he went to Buchanan High, and they seem to be familiar with it, so it doesn't sound too far away. She also knew June when she was younger, and she's mentioned being in Mayfield when younger (says she served coffee to service men during the war there), and possibly always lived there or nearby.

So why does Dudley seem more like an American who's spent the past few years at a British boarding school? He knows nothing of social norms, how lockers work (they tell him to ask for a tall one for his overcoat, which would be a girls' locker), etc. He obviously doesn't know how to dress to avoid being picked on, and fashion wasn't that different around the country much less a region. He really seems alien to the whole way of life for American teenagers.

The process was tough, it made the job sound fast-paced, and a little intimidating.

But these days, I’m sitting in my home at 10.30am, sipping coffee, staring at my calendar, and realizing I have… nothing urgent to do. Again.

My first month was crazy. I set up project timelines, created dashboards for tracking, and streamlined how our team updated weekly reports. 

Then things slowed down. Once the initial setup was done, my daily workload shrank to some emails, occasional check-in meetings, and “urgent” requests.

For meetings, I barely pay attention. I recommend people to start using AI (fathom) to summarize and get action items. My 50-year-old director called me a “techie” for doing that. Man, I don’t even like tech that much.

Last week, my manager asked if I remembered a decision we made some months ago - I typed a keyword into my AI second brain (saner) and had the answer for him right away. And he asked me whether I have “photographic memory”. Sir, I don’t even remember my friends’ birthday.

Most of my time is now spent appearing busy. I schedule slack message to send later in the days, while with chatgpt, I actually finished them in maybe, 20 minutes

Sometimes, I feel guilty about how little I actually do.

I’ve picked up hobbies. I’ve learned to make fresh pasta. Started decorating my house. I’ve read more books this year than in the last two combined.

Every now and then, I panic that my manager will catch on and fire me during these silent layoffs, but last week, he told me I’m doing “an incredible job keeping everything on track.” So… I guess I’ll just keep doing what I’m doing?

I had a window seat. This airplane has a digital window block without a physical curtain to block sunlight. I set it to maximum obscurity after take off.

So around 2-3 am I sleep. And around 5 am I wake up. Some flashy light on the window wakes me up. I thought at first, it was the moon. It was a little circle. It was clearly bothering me, I couldn't sleep anymore. I went up and go to the bathroom.

Close to there, there was the resting place of the crew, and they were making some coffee and talking. I asked them if there was something wrong with the windows, since I was able to see the moon and it was bothering me a bit. He tells me to wait for a minute and goes to his computer to check. He comes back 10 seconds later and tells me everything is set to maximum obscurity. I tell him that I'm seeing the moon, and he tells me: ""oh that's actually the sun. And unfortunately there is nothing we can do. The old system worked better"".

I come back to my seat, and 30 minutes later, it was not only light, but heat. A lot of heat coming through my window and making me sweat. It was like that for 3 hours or so until the sun moved and/or we also moved our direction a bit, and once it stopped hitting my window directly, it got better. After some time it got cold again and I could sleep some hours. Although it was no longer dark outside.

So, I'm here thinking, maybe I should give a feedback to Boeing? under their ""unsolicited ideas"" website? I couldn't find another communication channel for this. I could also send a feedback to the airline.

So basically it seems the new system is both worse for blocking sunlight and temperature. Very fancy, but I'd rather have the old system to be honest. What do you think?",1,1756699986.0,boeing,0,1.0,False

I'm in my early 20s and, up until recently, was not attracted to men. I spent time identifying as a lesbian and later as transmasc. I was only on T for a short time as it gave me thyroiditis. For those who are interested, there's evidence testosterone can cause thyroid changes in transmen, so I think this might be more common than people realize:

https://www.endocrine-abstracts.org/ea/0090/ea0090p230

I didn't pass on testosterone and, off it, I look like a normal woman; but it seems to have altered my sexuality. This is not common but it can happen:

https://www.reddit.com/r/detrans/s/Dknv6Ga2dJ

Before all of this, I hadn't experienced any genuine attraction to men. Now I am heavily attracted to them, especially to a friend.

I met him (29) through work (I work at a coffee shop and he is a regular, we are not coworkers) and we hit it off. I needed a car and he has a dealer license so we started working on finding me one, and then he was super cool about explaining exactly what he was repairing & sending me pictures of the progress. I also helped him with fixing a muffler issue. 

I'm attracted to him and would like to explore a relationship, but have no idea what dating a man is like. I know he's attracted to me and he's told me that I'd ""be a fun girlfriend."" 

He is also conservative leaning and has LDS (Mormon) parents, so I don't really know how they'd feel about everything.

I would appreciate advice on: 

1) Dating men for the first time. 

2) Any information on how LDS people view trans and gay issues. I felt genuine attraction to women and have had dysphoric feelings, and I don't want to lie about that. 

3) Specific advice regarding making it clear this man can approach me without being too bold / masculine about how I do it. I don't want to scare him off, and I am not naturally good at flirting.

I'm losing my mind and am desperate for some strength.

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a little over a year and a half now. We started as friends, then a situation ship, then was exclusive for months and months before we made things official. While we were exclusive, he cheated on me with one of his friends. They cuddled and kissed on a night of a party that I didn't go to. Our whole relationship I had suspicions about this girl. She was a regular who would come over to his house to their parties and I liked her. He didn't tell me anything about her and actively had me interact with her and he would too which is messed up. I had my suspicions about her so I asked him if he had a history with her and he said yes, they kissed once before we were exclusive and that was it. My intuition was telling me that that wasn't the whole story, I still felt weird about her, so I decided to get coffee with her after sitting with that story for a month or so. I tell him I'm gonna get coffee with her to hear her side of the story. The day before, he sits me down, and tells me the truth that everything happened while we were exclusive. My heart shatters. I thought this would never happen to me especially because he was cheated on in the past as well. I still get coffee with the other girl the next day and she was very kind. She answered all my questions, retold her version of the story which was slightly different than his, and apologized and acknowledged how selfish she was being. The talk with her went as well as it could have, and me and the boyfriend decide to go on a break for like a month.

Obviously we got back together after the break, and I've been trying to work through the trauma of him cheating on me. All my friends think I should have broken up with him but they support me no matter what. My therapist thinks I should have broken up with him as well. I also saw a psychic (i know i know) and she said he is holding me back and I am going to continue to be miserable if I stay with him. I really have tried working through this betrayal, but I feel like no matter how much ""progress"" I feel like I'm making, I'm still having relapses because I'm trying to heal in the same environment that hurt me. I've felt so stuck in place since January when we decided to get back together and move past this. Throughout all the issues I had since January, we would talk about them, he would be super receptive and kind, promise to do better, and we would move on until a few weeks later when something else bothers me. He's the best communicator I've dated, he's never invalidated my feelings, and he takes responsibility for his actions and what he did to me. I love him so much, and I've had so much fun with him since getting back together and we have so many things we want to still do together and there's so much fun to be had together, but our relationship is tearing me apart.

I've become such a mistrusting anxious person. I pester him for details, react aggressively an unnecessarily mean when he says something triggering to me. He'll say ""this girl flirted with me at a bar but I shot her down saying I have a girlfriend and she walked away"" and I'll say ""are you sure you didn't just cave in like last time?"". I've never been like this. I'm a loving trusting person and I haven't been that person since everything. I'm not usually super confident but confident enough to be satisfied with myself. I've hated myself for most of our relationship. I find myself stalking her semi-famous tik tok account and instagram to compare myself. I see that other people love her, how skinny and tall she is, and think I will never be the kind of woman she is. No wonder he cheated on me with her.

I fear it's this lack of confidence that is stopping me from ending my relationship. I'm scared of being alone, I feel like he's the best I can do, no one else will get my sense of humor, have patience and kindness with me. No one will be able to communicate like he does with me, validate my feelings, and never say I'm crazy. I'm out of college so I fear I have no way of meeting new people (I hate dating apps). I'm too scared of how painful it will be to break up with him that I just can't do it. We still have so much we want to do together. The crazy thing is too, I know that if I break up with him, my life will start moving again. I've had such a hard time finding a full time job, going to the gym, taking care of myself, and I think it's all because I'm so emotionally spent. I can feel it in my bones that after I break up with him, my life is going to take off. But I just don't have the strength to do it.

Do I try to keep working through it? Am I being silly in thinking that I won't meet anyone again? I feel so crushed. I wish I broke up with him when I found out everything. Please help guide me towards the right thing to do and help reassure me that a breakup isn't the end of the world.

TLDR: Been dating for two years, he cheated on me while we were exclusive, and we've tried working through it but this relationship has made me anxious, mistrusting, and destroyed my self confidence and image.

I'm losing my mind and am desperate for some strength.

I (25F) have been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a little over a year and a half now. We started as friends, then a situation ship, then was exclusive for months and months before we made things official. While we were exclusive, he cheated on me with one of his friends. They cuddled and kissed on a night of a party that I didn't go to. Our whole relationship I had suspicions about this girl. She was a regular who would come over to his house to their parties and I liked her. He didn't tell me anything about her and actively had me interact with her and he would too which is messed up. I had my suspicions about her so I asked him if he had a history with her and he said yes, they kissed once before we were exclusive and that was it. My intuition was telling me that that wasn't the whole story, I still felt weird about her, so I decided to get coffee with her after sitting with that story for a month or so. I tell him I'm gonna get coffee with her to hear her side of the story. The day before, he sits me down, and tells me the truth that everything happened while we were exclusive. My heart shatters. I thought this would never happen to me especially because he was cheated on in the past as well. I still get coffee with the other girl the next day and she was very kind. She answered all my questions, retold her version of the story which was slightly different than his, and apologized and acknowledged how selfish she was being. The talk with her went as well as it could have, and me and the boyfriend decide to go on a break for like a month.

Obviously we got back together after the break, and I've been trying to work through the trauma of him cheating on me. All my friends think I should have broken up with him but they support me no matter what. My therapist thinks I should have broken up with him as well. I also saw a psychic (i know i know) and she said he is holding me back and I am going to continue to be miserable if I stay with him. I really have tried working through this betrayal, but I feel like no matter how much ""progress"" I feel like I'm making, I'm still having relapses because I'm trying to heal in the same environment that hurt me. I've felt so stuck in place since January when we decided to get back together and move past this. Throughout all the issues I had since January, we would talk about them, he would be super receptive and kind, promise to do better, and we would move on until a few weeks later when something else bothers me. He's the best communicator I've dated, he's never invalidated my feelings, and he takes responsibility for his actions and what he did to me. I love him so much, and I've had so much fun with him since getting back together and we have so many things we want to still do together and there's so much fun to be had together, but our relationship is tearing me apart.

I've become such a mistrusting anxious person. I pester him for details, react aggressively an unnecessarily mean when he says something triggering to me. He'll say ""this girl flirted with me at a bar but I shot her down saying I have a girlfriend and she walked away"" and I'll say ""are you sure you didn't just cave in like last time?"". I've never been like this. I'm a loving trusting person and I haven't been that person since everything. I'm not usually super confident but confident enough to be satisfied with myself. I've hated myself for most of our relationship. I find myself stalking her semi-famous tik tok account and instagram to compare myself. I see that other people love her, how skinny and tall she is, and think I will never be the kind of woman she is. No wonder he cheated on me with her.

I fear it's this lack of confidence that is stopping me from ending my relationship. I'm scared of being alone, I feel like he's the best I can do, no one else will get my sense of humor, have patience and kindness with me. No one will be able to communicate like he does with me, validate my feelings, and never say I'm crazy. I'm out of college so I fear I have no way of meeting new people (I hate dating apps). I'm too scared of how painful it will be to break up with him that I just can't do it. We still have so much we want to do together. The crazy thing is too, I know that if I break up with him, my life will start moving again. I've had such a hard time finding a full time job, going to the gym, taking care of myself, and I think it's all because I'm so emotionally spent.

It started when I (28F) met my boyfriend (32M) at My first job out of college. It was 4 years ago and he was in the office right next to me. We started talking my very first full day. We would spend hours just chatting and getting to know each other to the point other coworkers knew to look for him in my office if they needed him. He made it pretty clear that he wanted to date me but at first I turned him down because I didn't think it was professional to date a co-worker. With a little persuasion from my parents they told me to keep talking to him with my dad saying I should date him. Eventually I I said yes to dating. Things were great and I really enjoyed being with him. Sometimes we would spend 2 hours after work just talking and making out in a nearby area. One of my favorite moments was when my mom help me get ready for a Valentine's date with him. But there was also one night where after he took me and my twin sister out to dinner so he could meet her I stayed over at his apartment for the first night. My mom was calling me and telling me to come home and that she was upset with me being there that night. This is when I live with my parents. I did end up staying the night But my mom and sister were upset with me the next day.

At work My boss had hired a replacement for her since she was retiring. He wound up being a creep to me. The worst it got was a unwanted shoulder massage. I took this to HR and my boss a couple times but in the end they sided with him since my boss really wanted to retire. After my last attempt I told my BF about their decision. The next day he came into work and quit that day to show them he was upset with what happened. I put in my two weeks that day too but I didn't know he had already quit. Because he was their only IT person it ended up causing them a lot of issues.

The big problem with us came when one day I was with my BF I saw some recent cutting scars. He had offhand mentioned that he did cut but I didn't really think about it. It wasn't a lot but they looked kind of bad and it freaked me out. We tried to continue the hang out But I couldn't take it and he said I should go home. The next day I called him to let him know I wanted to break up. He said if that's what I wanted it was fine And we went our separate ways for a little while. A few days later he called me and said that he didn't want things to end between us. He said he was done with cutting since he saw that it scared me. I can confirm he has 100% Not done in the last 4 years. But after the phone call My mom said I should give it 3 months before I see/talk/text to him just to give it sometime. We didn't quite follow that rule and would text and talk kind of often during that time.

At one point my sister found this out. She got into my phone blocked his number and deleted his contact. She yelled at me while we're at a baseball game for my little brother It made me cry and leave. I only found his number because I saved a sticky note that he wrote it on for me. She also told my mom about me talking to him. My mom told me she couldn't trust me because of this. After the 3 months had finished I said I was going to go see him But she said I should just quit seeing him overall. I did it anyways but then later that week my mom said that she was going to put all my stuff out on the lawn and kick me out if I continued seeing him.

I ended up getting a temporary job and then moving out with my sister and a friend. The job itself was a small thing with a vendor I knew from My last job. It was just me and her. The work took place at her house but she was a hoarder. Her place was filthy And the pay was bad. I eventually left so I could focus on finding a new job. When I showed my parents pictures of her house they were surprised that someone could live like that And were happy I quit. During the second time I was out of a job I was helping take care of my grandparents who have some mental decline issues. It made me really sad. My BF was there for me during all of this through text messages and phone calls we kept secret. Because I didn't have a job My sister made me The maid of the house cleaning up after her and our friend. She would tell me that I have all the time in the world so cleaning up after everyone and cooking dinner for her was my responsibility. At one point I did break up with him because I was very overwhelmed with the responsibilities my sister and parents were putting on me and I kept being unable to see him. But I called him back a week later and he said he understood and we were back together.

When I started up my next job me and my BF talked and texted everyday and would occasionally meet up to do random shopping trips whenever we needed something. During this time he also drove from his work to my new job a few times when my car broke down so he could jump it for me. Some problems happened at that job and my boss slowly took away responsibilities of mine and gave them to a new hire eventually leaving me with very little to do. In my year review he told me that I don't do anything to help the job site and that the whole review was a waste and I wouldn't be getting a raise. I quit shortly after that. 

My Dad was proud that I got out of there but my mom was disappointed I had lost another job. My BF and I continue to text and talk through this whole time And it was really great. He supported me leaving and it made me feel like it was okay for me to leave. Occasionally we would meet up at a cafe to chat and do applications for me. But my sister would track where I was using my phone and call me to check up on me. If I stayed in any spot too long she got suspicious and would call. I started sneaking my boyfriend over at night when my parents left town and my sister would watch their place for them. Every time he came over I had a lot of fun with him and he made me feel safe.

A person from my second serious job knew of an electrical company that was hiring in the payroll department. I ended up working there. It started off fine but went downhill. There was a co-worker that was a friend to the boss. She would regularly bully me and guy that worked in payroll. She would say we're useless to the boss during meetings. She pulled me aside one time into a unoccupied office to yell at me for saying something about her to the boss privately. She also had seven full investigations by HR (including one where she was racist to another another employee who ended up changing positions at the company) before I made My complaint. The company itself also lied about giving me a raise. I feel like I have to defend myself since this was my third job I ended up leaving but I just felt horrible at this place. It was the most depressed I had ever felt. My BF was there this whole time and we would continue our phone calls/texting/sneaking as we could and keeping everything secret from my parents and sister. But it happened less and less and I missed a few events in his life like a wedding for one of his close friends. This was because my sister continued to monitor me after work and expect me to clean up and cook frequently for her. She would track me on her phone since she could work from home and if I went anywhere off the path coming home I would get multiple phone calls from her And she would tell our mom. Also during this time because I was stressed and depressed at one point my mom suggested I go on a date and set up a Hinge profile for me. I broke up with my boyfriend again a few days before and went on the date. The date went horribly And I felt disgusting after the date. I called up my BF as I was driving home from the date and ask questions about guys / complained to him. He was really upset but we got back together. When I left the electric company both of my parents were disappointed at me for leaving another job. But my BF supported me saying I was getting bullied and that job was taking a toll on me. One point during this job I was hanging out with an ex-friend of mine And we had edibles at her place. It was only my second time. And I ended up getting really high. After I left her place I called my BF and talked to him. He said I was too high to be driving and got me to pull into a parking lot. He drove out to me and was going to drive me home but I was concerned about my car so he drove me in my car too my parents house and then walked back to his car. I called him because I didn't think I could safely call my sister. I felt she would just left me on my own or told our mom me getting high. My BF the next day stop by my parents house and introduced himself. They hadn't seen him other than through the front window by this point. He told them I made a good decision and called him and that he was the one that drove me home. He said that they were nice and my dad thought highly of him because of that but my mom was mad at me for talking to him and wanted me to stop being friends with him overall

I'll mention here that I ended up leaving my BF a couple of times due to being scared about being caught in contact with him. And One of those times I did go on another date. The same thing happened and I talked to my BF right after that date. He's been upset with me a few times for the breaking up and getting back together. We have had a couple fights about it and when I tell him I can see him or make something happen and then end up breaking that promise. There have been a few weeks where I promised I would see him the next day and then the next day until we got to the weekend and that's when my parents or sister would need me to do stuff for them and I was unable to see him that weekend. I've tested the waters with my family a couple times by bringing up his name. My sister always says a lot of nasty things about him and my mom says he was a loser and tells me I'm better without him. I still sneak him over every now and again to my new place with just me and my sister. (Lease ended on the last place and it's a house close to my parents' place that my grandparents own)

Since being at this new house what my sister expects of me has only gotten worse. She expects lots of cooking and cleaning from me Even though she works from home most of the time and at my current job it's more stable but there are harder days. She monitors me consistently and even using the home cameras calling me if I so much as open the garage late at night. I've still got him over a couple times but it's become far less because of that for the last 2 years most of our communication has been text messages and phone calls. We probably seen each either about a dozen times. Also something that happened that made my boyfriend upset was my parents wanted me to sell my car to my little brother. At the time I had my second job I flew down to California to buy a car from a family friend. It was my most expensive purchase at the time but still a good deal (about 10k) And I had to drive it all the way back myself. I really liked that car but my brother completed college and was getting a summer internship and didn't have a car himself. My parents said I should give him my car and buy a new one for myself. Because of the job uncertainty I'd saved up more then my sister so my parents said I could take on the car payments of a new car. My boyfriend was really against them doing saying this and he brought up how I was proud of buying the car and driving it back myself. But my parents ended up taking me to a dealership one day and said that we had to get the new car that day. My mom ended up saying that she would give me 7K for The old car and tried to bring it down to 6K because of some issues I told her about when I first bought it. I pushed back on that and told her how I can get 12k for the car if I just sold it. My BF told me to keep the car and not give it to my little brother or push back against my family but my dad told me it was important for the family and I was helping my brother out.

Most recently I signed up for a long marathon with my sister since her work team needed another person. Because of the stress of trying to train for it I ended up breaking up with my BF another time. I went on two dates with another guy and the same thing happened. I called him after the second date. We talked a little bit and I found out he had a one night stand with someone else. At first this destroyed me and I still think about it sometimes but I've pretty much forgiven him for it and we got back together before the marathon. But he was still really upset that my mom was calling me fat during this time as I was training. She would make comments or just say it directly to my face. She's done this before but it came out a lot more during this time since I was really working on the training. Things with my sister are still pretty bad and I threatened that I would move out. I really do want to because we don't talk a lot at home (she always shuts me down when I start to talk about my work) and doesn't like people coming over so I can't have anyone over and she doesn't bring friends over herself. She respect any of my requests and gets mad at me for the smallest things. I recently spilled a little coffee on her shoes and she chewed me out. She immediately tells our mom anytime I do something she doesn't like and then our mom gets on me about it. And anytime my sister yells at me my body just shuts down. But I also have a hard time telling my parents about my BF. I really do like him. He's asked a couple times if I want to keep trying for him and I've said I do. But after the last breakup he does speed dating occasionally and I know he swipes on apps. I am afraid of losing him and I don't like the idea of him being with another woman. At the same time I'm scared of my parents and they've always told me family is the most important and I don't want to lose them.

TLDR: I'm confused because I like my BF But my family doesn't. He's been there for me a lot and I talk and text him everyday. I want to do those girlfriend things for him and have them in my life but I don't know how or if I can bring him up to my family. I want to keep him but also my family can anyone give me advice?",1,1756698799.0,relationship_advice,0,0.67,False

My mom always tells me to get a job and start earning and lately I have been so annoyed that I try to minimize our interactions. My dad always asks me if I got anything but I make up excuses and don't answer him. I can't even give time for my hobbies nowadays. I talked to my dad about having no motivation to work hard and have no life goals. My dad was very surprised because according to him, he never met any person like this. I can't talk to my mom about this because she would just say to work more hard. Few weeks back, my aunt kept asking me why I don't go out of the house anymore. I replied that since I'm trying to be a software developer that I need to work on my laptop and yet she still kept on asking the same question. She kept on telling me that my health is above my career. This argument continued for 3 hrs and I finally broke down and said that I had planned to end it this year. My mom was just sitting beside me the whole time btw. My aunt replied that why didn't I think of my parents when I thought of this. She's right about this but what I didn't hear them asking me was why did I think of this and If I was doing okay. My mom told my dad about this and my dad just told me to not be angry with my aunt and to forgive family. I don't even have trustworthy friends that I can talk to about any of this.

Neurosurgery resident here. Been near-sighted since college at around -4.00. Noticed my left eye was slightly more blurred than usual, thought it was due to dryness because all I do is stare at a computer for most of my life.

Got an eye exam and was diagnosed with central serous retinopathy (CSR). 

The doctor tells me that the best way to prevent or reduce recurrences of CSR are:

1) Getting enough sleep 7-8 hours a day

3) Reduce caffeine and alcohol intake.

Sir, respectfully, as a nsgy resident, all I do is be stressed, sleep less than 7 hours a day, and drink coffee at work and alcohol when I'm not at work

Tell me what you think about this incident. I am 32(F) and she is 38(F)

So I have a cousin 6 years older. We aren’t exactly close, but we are friendly and I ask her for advice a lot. I do admire her, especially her work ethic and she does have a good heart. I’m not a really touchy feely person, but especially like growing up I wasn’t with her, and she knows that.

We were recently at a relative’s party a few months ago with guests and family. I forgot exactly what we were talking about and I’m trying to remember. But essentially, she pats my head. I really don’t like when people do that to me (I am 5’0 she’s like 5’7). I’m not a kid or a puppy. Mind you, she did this at a party with guests and friends present as well. 

So I reached my arm up and patted her back on the head.


And she got so mad like coldly said “don’t do that to me again.” All serious and dark face. I said “I’m 32” and she said “yes but I’m older than you and I meant it playfully don’t be so angry all the time, you’re being a brat” I said “well I find patting my head condescending, I hated when my boss used to do that.” Then she said “well that’s different that’s not appropriate, I was being playful.” She was getting angrier and angrier, and since it was a public event I took the high road and diffused, so I just said “look sorry let me get you a coffee.” AITA? I really am not touchy feely and I’m going to try to emphasize that again someday. I just didn’t like it. My own mother never pat my head, no one in my immediate family did, smh.

1n5eb0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1n5eb0b/bf_said_i_was_to_stupid/,Bf said I was to stupid,"I have always had what my parents would say a ""learning disability."" I was never properly diagnosed and went through all of public school with I'm guessing some form of ADD/ADHD and most likely dyslexia. Parents, if you think your child is struggling, get them tested. The long-lasting side effects of not being properly diagnosed are truly unsettling. 

Anyway, I(f)met my high school bf lets call him DH in grade 11. We were together for the better part of 3 years. I graduated high school at the age of 18 and proceeded to enter college/tades school the same year.
 
I won't say I'm the smartest or brighest person. And definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed. But when I put my mind to something, I can get things done. Learning in a practical and hands-on way is so much easier than learning behind a desk with my nose stuck in a book. That's  why, I decided to go to trades school. The course I was headed to was set up by a large company and was tailored to a specific job that is quite frankly very specialized and lucrative.

The first year of school, I had actually wanted to take a break and figure out what I wanted to do. You know, work a few crappy jobs pay rent so I could figure out how much that sucks and then decide to go back to school. My pops said, ""No, you're going now, or you are out of this house."" So off I went, and that year I was a Christmas graduate. I missed it by 2%. 

I then worked a job cleaning new construction homes for a few months. Oh my goodness, if someone who buys a new home were to come in and see the absolute disaster, those construction workers leave in brand new jacuzzi tubs. Ew, ew,ew soooo freaking gross. Well, I got to clean those sorts of messes, and after one or two more, I decided I needed to get back to school.

The summer before school was to start, DH planned a road trip to Newfoundland with a few friends. He was dead set on going, and I thought it would be such an awesome trip. He knew when I'd be starting school. I had paid my tuition. He decided to tell me we were headed out the first day my classes started. 

I told him, ""That's the day school starts. I can't go, why would you plan it for that day?""
 
His answer, ""You already failed once, I don't think you're smart enough to get the job."" 

""Excused me? How are we going to build a life together? You can't work or keep a job. Sure, your inheritance is nice, but it won't last forever. What? You want me to stay home and make you samiches for the rest of my life?""

 His answer was, ""Yes, that's what you're supposed to do."" I dumped his ass right there and then.

I had just gone shopping with my mom. She had asked how DH and I were doing. I told her, ""If it keeps going the way it's going, I don't think it'll last another month."" 

I lost the ball and chain the next day.

All my life, I heard ""she's slow."" ""She's not much.""She'll never go anywhere,"" but really, I just needed a little one on one learning. Nothing major. I just had to rearrange how I learn compared to others. 

I went back to school that year and got a part-time job at a gas station where DH would come and harass me every now and then. It was awful.

After a few years, my sister told me she saw him at a bar one night, and DH had asked her how I was doing. She told him that I had finished school and got the job : )

She said the look on his face dropped when he heard it. Like he was upset about it. He was expecting to hear how my life had gone to shit and how crappy it was going for me. I hadn't told her what DH had said to me the day we broke up. She laughed when she found out.

Few years later, I saw DH's mom working at a local coffee shop. She recognized me right away and told me it's my fault that her son will never marry anyone. My reply to her was, ""That's nice, for every woman on this planet. Grace, you deserve a better son.""

I know it's not much, but the fact that I did it in spite of him makes me so happy.

We met randomly while out at a bar. It's PPM (sort of) but no formal arrangement. I just gift her cash and other things whenever I see her. Even when I don't see her. We see each other about once a week, sometimes twice. So far it's been amazing, but it's not progressing to the next level. 

I'd be lying if I said the relationship isn't anchored in sex. It's off the charts, but it's basically all we do. Every time we meet, we don't leave the apartment. Relax, I'm not complaining. But I'm starting to wonder if this is all it's gonna be. 

The emotional connection is clearly there. The things she says, the way she kisses me. Her eyes don't lie. But I'm starting to think that the sex is a way for her to control the situation, and in a strange way keep me from getting too close. 

She knows how I feel. I'm not keeping it a secret. And she knows I want to take her out. Just this week I asked if she wanted to get coffee. I made it clear that it would be super casual, no strings attached, just a nice change of pace. But she got nervous or something. I even offered to pay her, but she said I wouldn't have to do that. She said maybe this weekend, and she would let me know the next day.

Of course she didn't. That was Tuesday. I texted her Friday and she didn't reply. Her communication already kind of sucks, so I don't think she's ghosting me (at least I hope not). She'll probably text me back Monday with some excuse.

Broke up a year ago, due to an unexpected external issue however there were also things I was also not too happy with but I was hoping we could address them. We still love each other and while I thought our communication would dissolve we were communicating every month because his mother was gravely ill. His mom recently got a bit better, he would end his texts talking about how he looked forward to meeting up for coffee when he is back. But when he got back I asked for no contact because of how in a loop I was feeling and the constant feeling of hope or like he is still my partner and I needed some time to detach myself and accept things as they are and not see him that way before talking again. He did not reply to my no contact message which was so unexpected and heart breaking really, especially since he has always been so up front, communicative and said he wanted an amicable separation. I unfriended him on apps so that I don't stay going in a loop and also cause I kept getting pages of girls he followed on my suggestions. I am still filled with worry for his mom but more than that the indignation and shock of him not replying, it makes me guess why he may not be replying--something that changes nothing and he is valid in any and all feelings and time he may need to go through to process it, I know, but I just feel like it was basic courtesy. I was going back and forth on to text him again but I guess he just gave me what I asked for and I should keep it this way and if he ever gets around to replying he does. It just has me feeling so many things and mostly shock that he just left the message as is without an amicable goodbye when we broke up amicably. Idk how to react if I knock into him, I really do love him and wish him the best. But if we can't be together what else do I do but try and move forward...",1,1756697730.0,nocontact,0,1.0,False

They check websites. Scroll socials. Read blogs. Refresh LinkedIn job posts.

It eats time and gives you nothing back.

So I flipped the script.

I built a simple n8n automation that does all the dirty work:

Tracks competitor sites + RSS feeds

Summarizes updates with AI

Spots patterns (new hires → product launch coming)

Drops everything into Notion + Slack every morning

Now I wake up, sip coffee, and already know:

1 What products they’re pushing
2 What clients they’re chasing
3 What their next move might be

This isn’t just about “saving time.”
It’s about creating an unfair advantage without burning yourself out.

With all the tariff shenanigans that’s been happening especially getting rid of the $800 de minimis rule, this might be the last time I order coffee from a foreign country until there is an action taken. I was hoping to launch a really cool subscription service later this year too 🥲. I feel like what made us stand out is carrying really cool roasters from overseas, so it’s fundamentally gonna change how we operate. What should I do?

An Expert’s 2025 Guide for Bahrain Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Professional businesspeople strategizing in a modern office., ready for majlis-style meetings that started, as always, with a warm handshake and polite banter about family. The Bahrain Bay skyline shimmered across the water. I’d just left a brisk licensing appointment at the MOICT’s Sijilat counter – and yes, I learned there’s a right time to queue if you want your application to zoom through.\
But here’s what struck me even harder: Bahrain’s openness to global business is real—but it’s not unlimited. I learned this the hard way, stuck for days sorting through sector approvals because I’d missed a subtle restriction. (Pro tip: Always ask the Sijilat desk about “activity-specific caps”—they’ll save you hours.)\
Want to start a company in Bahrain? You’re in the right place. This is the only complete, firsthand, and artistically nuanced guide you’ll need to understand Bahrain company formation, foreign ownership policies, and sector-specific restrictions—plus, the practical nuts-and-bolts tricks that matter right now, in 2025.\

Bahrain’s Business Environment in 2025: Data, Growth, and Real Opportunities\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting., GDP is set to expand by 2.7% in 2025. A Forbes Business review last quarter spotlighted Bahrain’s surging fintech, logistics, and tourism sectors, reinforced by the Economic Development Board (EDB)’s focus on diversification.\
Free zones—especially the Bahrain Logistics Zone and Bahrain International Investment Park—draw record FDI with flexible setups and almost-instant onboarding. I’ve even seen startups in Diplomatic Area turn profitable in under a year, thanks to Tamkeen’s financial support (there’s a new 2025 startup grant window running May–August).\
Importantly, Bahrain’s regulatory environment outpaces the GCC for transparency, digital-first bureaucracy (Sijilat, LMRA, and eGov are life-savers), and—yes—accessibility for foreign founders. Business hours shift around Ramadan, but efficiency never drops.\

The 2025 Landscape: Bahrain’s Foreign Ownership Policy\
\
Most sectors: 100% foreign ownership is standard.\
Restricted sectors: Local participation is mandatory, often at 51% Bahraini ownership.\
Special cases: A few “sensitive” activities are reserved for GCC or Bahraini nationals only.\
\
Surprisingly, Bahrain is far more open than neighboring Saudi Arabia or UAE (where free zones limit you to certain activities and you’re often tied to a sponsor).\
2025 Regulatory Update\
As of February 1, 2025, MOICT revised Decision No. 13 to expand the negative list, impacting new energy and telecommunications sub-sectors. New tech finance activities, however, are now open for 100% foreign ownership.\

- Professional Services: Company formation support: BHD 400–900, depending on complexity.\
- LMRA (work visas): BHD 100 initial, then BHD 5/month per expat.\
- Accounting & Compliance: From BHD 70/month for basic packages.\
- Bank Account Opening: Free, but expect minimum balances of BHD 1,000–5,000 for business accounts.\

4. Apply via Sijilat\

Online or at the MOICT desk in Diplomatic Area. Bring all originals; digital copies are accepted but originals speed up processing.\
Use the “priority queue” window if your agent is an approved service provider.\
\
5. Get Additional Approvals (If Needed)\
\
Some activities (e.g., healthcare, food import) need external ministry NOCs.\
Pro tip: Submit NOC requests at 11am Wednesday—most officials work late that day, so files move faster.\
\
6. Open Your Corporate Bank Account\
\
Standard packages from Bank of Bahrain & Kuwait, Ahli United. KYC is stricter than in UAE but still efficient.\
\
7. Visa Processing via LMRA\
\
LMRA eSupport portal is a time-saver. Schedule in advance.\

Free Zones: The Fast Lane for Foreign Ownership\
\
Want the roadmap to Bahrain’s top free zones?\
Keylink Free Zones Guide\

Free zones like the Bahrain Logistics Zone let you skip most sector restrictions, enjoy 100% foreign ownership, and speed up licensing. However, some activities—especially in the “negative list” sectors—remain off-limits, even in free zones.\
\
Tangent: The Hidden Value of Bahrain’s Traditional Business Customs\
Sometimes, the difference between a stuck and a seamless application is a simple cup of Arabic coffee. Once, when seeking municipal approval for a client’s real estate project, I was invited to a majlis. The “informal” chat, over dates and qahwa, led to an introduction that fixed a documentation hiccup before it even became a problem.\
Unlike Dubai’s impersonal system or Riyadh’s sometimes rigid hierarchy, Bahrain’s business culture really does favor personal relationships—especially if you respect the rhythm of Ramadan hours and traditional networking.\
\
Bahrain vs. UAE and Saudi Arabia: The Foreign Ownership Edge\
\
Bahrain: Fewer sector restrictions, cheaper setup, faster bureaucracy\
UAE: 100% ownership restricted to free zones, higher costs, and complicated sponsor rules outside those areas\
Saudi Arabia: Expensive licensing, longer timelines, and more activity restrictions\
\
\
UAE and KSA both have more aggressive “Saudization/Emiratization” policies. Bahrain stands out for its pragmatic, founder-friendly approach.\
\
\
Common Mistake Alert—and How to Avoid It\
Too many founders file their Sijilat application under the wrong activity code, thinking “all finance is finance” or “consultancy is always allowed.” Wrong. Bahrain’s licensing granularity is impressive (and sometimes maddening).\
\
Strategy: Use the Keylink activity checker or ask an approved company formation expert before submitting anything. Saves weeks.\
\
\
My #1 Recommended Service Provider\
For hassle-free setup, I strongly recommend Keylink’s Bahrain team. They not only fast-track Sijilat and LMRA appointments (seriously, ask for Hasan in the Seef branch—he’s a wizard), but also keep you updated on every regulatory change, including the February 2025 updates. Their document templates and embassy pre-certification service are major time-savers.\

Professional Support & Networking\

\
FAQ: Bahrain Company Formation & Foreign Ownership Restrictions\
Q1: Can I get 100% foreign ownership for ANY sector in Bahrain?\
No. Sensitive sectors—oil, security, customs, agriculture, and media—still require Bahraini or GCC national participation. Check the latest list before investing.\
Q2: How much does company formation really cost in Bahrain?\
Most foreign-owned company setups cost BHD 1,200–2,500 total (including licenses, office, and consulting), but see the detailed cost breakdown.\
Q3: What’s the fastest way to set up my business?\
Use a virtual office (Regus or iSpace), prepare pre-certified documents, and file your Sijilat application just after a holiday period. For detailed, step-by-step help, see Keylink Bahrain Company Formation Process.\
Q4: Are there free zones where all activities are open to foreigners?\
No. Even Bahrain’s free zones must abide by “negative list” sector rules—oil, military, and customs are closed to full foreign ownership. Full details: Keylink Free Zones Guide.\
Q5: What ongoing compliance do I need to manage?\
Annual audits, quarterly VAT, LMRA renewals, and CR renewals. Most entrepreneurs outsource this—start with Keylink’s accounting and bookkeeping support.\
\
If you respect the rules, build strong relationships, and time your applications smartly, Bahrain’s business doors swing wide open. And if you ever get stuck at the MOICT counter in Diplomatic Area, order a qahwa, smile, and remember—sometimes, the old-school approach is still the best shortcut of all.",1,1756697388.0,companysetupbh,1,1.0,False
1n5e3kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Presidents/comments/1n5e3kn/thoughts_on_tr/,Thoughts on TR,"*Mr. Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the twentieth century; always showing off; always hunting for a chance to show off; in his frenzied imagination the Great Republic is a vast Barnum circus with him for a clown and the whole world for audience; he would go to Halifax for half a chance to show off and he would go to hell for a whole one.*

\- Mark Twain

  
I am not a fan of Theodore Roosevelt. Out of respect for him and his historical stature, I will not use the nickname he hated so much, but it's worth noting he would probably not afford the same to me. TR was a man devoid of character, a fact that is obvious to anyone willing to do an objective analysis. He was, in the words of Mark Twain, ""always showing off."" Most people don't like that. However, I don't think I can get anyone to change their opinion of him by proving he was a bad man, so instead I am going to deconstruct his macho exterior and reveal the blubbering buffoon thinly veiled underneath.

Where should I begin? I think I'll focus on petty things since that's definitely what he would do. You're probably familiar with the famous line ""it's good to the last drop"" referring to some brand of coffee that I can't remember right now. Well, that line came from none other than our 26th president, Ted. Apparently, after drinking a cup, he exclaimed ""it's good to the last drop!"" like the corny character he was. Seriously, who does that? Did literally everything in his life constantly have to be performative? He had ""main character syndrome"" to an insane degree. I'm guessing it originated from his debilitating illnesses that made him feel inferior as a child.

Perhaps that's why, after literally being shot, Ted pretended it didn't hurt. Everyone thinks it's so incredible how he kept giving his speech with a fresh bullet lodged in his chest. Sorry, but that's just ridiculous. Either he had a death wish or he was just so narcissistic that he had to stand up there like a fool and try and convince everyone he was okay. He's like the kid at school that's getting picked on by the football players and pretending to be nonchalant while he's literally on the verge of tears. When pressed into a bullying corner like that, kids will always say something cringe in a frantic attempt at saving face, inevitably prompting more laughter from their cruel and unforgiving peers. ""It'll take more than that to kill a bull moose"" was that moment for TR. Another corny line for a chronically corny individual.

Of course, all of that could have been avoided if he wasn't running for president in the first place. That was the campaign of 1912, when he selfishly split the Republican vote against his hand-picked successor because he wasn't exactly like him or something. Usually people say Taft was a touch too conservative for TR's liking. The truth? Taft wasn't TR enough for TR's liking. He literally hd to leave the continent when Taft was first sworn in to restrain himself from hogging the spotlight. The moment he returned, he knew what he wanted to do. So he mounted a campaign that was doomed from the beginning, and resulted in the election of one of our worst presidents.

I once read a book that claimed Roosevelt was badly addicted to morphine. The drug thing definitely tracks, but morphine, really? If anything, I thought bro was using copious amounts of cocaine. How insufferable would he have been if he hadn't been doing opiates? Can you even imagine? It's sickening. It also makes his weight surprising, since he was chubby. Honestly, he should have ditched the mustache because it made him look way too much like the monopoly man. Ironic. Then again, that's life. You spend your whole life blustering and God will spite you in the most ironic of ways. Ted had it coming.",2,1756697270.0,Presidents,3,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis showdown that’s less *Wimby* and more *Whac-A-Mole*: **Amanda Anisimova** (8th seed) vs. **Beatriz Haddad Maia** (18th seed) in the US Open Round of 16. The stakes? Pride, glory, and the chance to make the other player question their life choices. Let’s break it down with the precision of a line judge on Red Bull.

### The Numbers Game: Why the Bookies Are Already Packing Goody Bags for Anisimova

* **Anisimova’s implied probability of winning?** A staggering **80.6%** (based on MyBookie.ag’s +1.24 odds). That’s like being 80% sure your Netflix password won’t expire mid-show.
* **Haddad Maia’s odds?** A meager **25%** (3.75 decimal). She’s the underdog equivalent of ordering a “large” coffee and getting a thimble.
* **Spreads:** Anisimova’s -4.5 line suggests bookmakers expect her to win in straight sets unless Haddad Maia suddenly invents a time machine to borrow Nadal’s stamina.
* **Totals:** The game is pegged at **20.5 games total**. If you’re betting on “Over,” you’re banking on a slugfest. “Under” implies a mercy rule.

### Style Clash: Flamethrower vs. Slow Cooker

Anisimova’s “aggressive baseline game” is a flat-out missile launch. She’s got the firepower of a tennis artillery unit, relying on blistering groundstrokes to end points before they begin. Think of her as the guy at the office party who dominates trivia by yelling answers before th

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Who Still Can’t Believe You’re Reading This*

**The Setup**  
Lorenzo Musetti (-200) enters Flushing Meadows as the statistical inevitability, a top-10 machine with the precision of a Roomba on a coffee high. Ranked No. 10, he’s steamrolled through Flavio Cobolli (6-3, 6-2, 2-0 ret.) and others, while Munar (No. 44), the “I’ve-been-here-before” Spaniard, clings to hope like a gambler on a losing streak. Their prior clash? A Musetti victory in Hong Kong. History, it seems, is a stubborn old friend.

**The Numbers**

* **Moneyline**: Musetti’s implied probability? A crisp **58.8%** (via -200 odds). Munar’s? A paltry **39.7%** (+155). The overlap? Pure chaos.
* **Spreads**: BetRivers has Musetti -4.5 games at **1.85**, while LowVig.ag offers Munar +3

# The Tree on top of The Hill

This tree is a healthy and bright looking tree on top of a hill. Most of the time, it is shown to be specifically near the graves of Charlie and the MCI. With Charlie being directly underneath it (it's very likely Charlie at least but I will get back to this later), meanwhile the MCI kids are at the bottom of the hill. We also see it in SB and Ruin. Glamrock Freddy, Vanessa, and Gregory (and Helpi I guess) sit underneath it in the endings. It also appears as graffiti on the wall of the Pizzaplex.

Attention is never called to it. It is never fully in view, always just out of sight or hanging above the screen. Although we are never told it's importance nor that it is even important at all, it has been cemented as a signature for graves and endings.

When it appears in FFPS, it is at the very end of the long story of the MCI kids. Them being set free, their graves, their first and ""second"" deaths all are encompassed at the end by this tree. When it appears in SB, it is at the beginning of a fresh start for the main characters. Gergory, Vanessa, and Gregory have escaped the grasp of the Pizzaplex and Mimic AI. Them sitting under this tree signifies the beginning of a new story, or their fresh start. Where they no longer are just strings to be pulled around, but are now free to make their own choices.

The setting of the tree is almost whimsical. Sunlight peeking through the clouds that bathes everything in an almost heavenly yellow tint. Plants and grass so green and vibrant that it makes the whole thing look like a painting. Mountains and hills all around that are covered with bright clouds. And despite this tree being on a relatively normal hill, it looks like it is higher than everything else. It gives the illusion that it is taller than mountains, and on the same level as clouds. However we know that it probably isn't, because after all it is just a lush hill.

**This tree is there at both the endings and beginnings of stories. But most importantly, this tree signifies freedom. Whenever someone is set free, you can be certain that this tree will be here (whether it be freedom from the mortal plane or freedom to choose your own life, the theme is still ever-present).**

# The Other Tree on top of a hill

In SOTM, there is a painting of David and The Mimic sitting underneath a tree on a hill, looking out at MCM.

The tree itself seems to be a direct mirror opposite of the previous tree. First of all, they are both on a hill, however they are on opposite sides. In this painting we see the left side of the hill and tree, meanwhile in the we see the right side. In this painting the characters seem to be looking at a sunrise, meanwhile the characters from the other seem to be looking at a sunset. In this painting the tree and hill are encompassing the shot, framing the portrait, meanwhile the other tree is always just out of sight. This tree is dark, with the characters being in the shadow of it, the other tree is the opposite. See what I am getting at?

These two very similar trees look to be mirror opposites of each other. Right and left. Dark and light. Sunrise and sunset. Et cetera. But in a way, that makes sense? This tree is seen in SOTM, the first game in the timeline. Almost like the origin of all the evil in this franchise, it is dark and looming over the frame. Meanwhile the other tree is found at the very end of the timeline. It is bright and hopeful, signifying freedom and new beginnings. Which also makes sense, as we are slowly building up to the happy ending, the ending of this \[current\] story, putting an end to all the suffering and having a happily-ever-after.

Ok, that was a lot of tree-talk. Granted that should be expected when going into a post about trees. Before we move on, I would like to talk about the painting itself, not just the tree. Because the painting is quite confusing.

First of all, David and The Mimic are sitting on a hill, looking off at MCM in the distance. But that begs the question, why are they out there in the middle of the woods? I guess you can blame it on being a painting, and not being literal. Fine, that is an acceptable explanation, however there is more to this that can't be explained just like that. When David knew The Mimic, he only knew M1. M2 was a direct product of David's death, so of course he could've only known M1. So we are seeing David and M1 in this painting, right? Well the problem is that the version of The Mimic we are looking at is actually M2. How do we know this? His hand. The Mimic had normal (albeit 4-fingered) hands. However after **M2** was beat by Edwin, one of his hands was replaced with a three-pointed pincer hand. Turns out that the hand we see of The Mimic in this painting is the pincer-hand, something that didn't exist until presumably years after David's death. So how are M2 and David both depicted in this painting? Maybe you could say Edwin took up painting after David's death, and decided to paint David and M2 together for some reason, despite the two never even meeting. But to be honest with you, I don't know. I just wanted to bring this up briefly (yeah right, ""*briefly*"") before moving on.

**Anyways, this tree is an mirror opposite of the first tree. This tree signifies the beginning of a dark story, the other tree signifies the long awaited happy-ending of that same story. It shows that this tree has been here the whole time, lurking around even through the lowest of lows and highest of highs.**

# The Graveyard Tree

This tree is from Princess Quest. When you enter the graveyard, that has 6 Gravestones (MCI+Charlie), you can find a tree. This tree looks, very ordinary admittedly, but it is relevant.

This graveyard is the only place out of all the Princess Quest Minigames that has trees. There are trees lining the walls of this graveyard, pretty unremarkable. However, the tree that we are talking about is smack dab in the center of everything. On top of that, it is **huge**, like waaay bigger than all the other trees. Just like all the others, it doesn't have any importance, you can't interact with it, it doesn't have any attention called to it, it is just there.

Another important detail is that it is in a graveyard, a graveyard with 6 Graves. Based off of HW2, these are probably the graves of the MCI kids and Charlie. Now where have I seen that before? A seemingly unimportant tree that is distinct in its setting that looms over the graves of Charlie and the MCI kids. That isn't new. That is the exact description of *The Tree on top of The Hill*, and that is also the description of *The Graveyard Tree*. They are clearly meant to be the same, or at least in the same vein as each other.

Now honestly, my first thought when I came across the connection between this tree and the tree on the hill, was Andrew. It's not an original thought, [here is a post about it from a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1gjhd7y/scrolling_through_twitter_and_found_this_thoughts/). But just think about it, a seemingly unremarkable yet obviously distinct/important object that is always seen looming in the background of the Main 6 Victims? Yeah that is totally Andrew. However, just based off of what we have already covered, I'm sure you can tell why that likely isn't the case. The rest of this post will concretely show us that AndrewTree/Treedrew is very unlikely (at least imo).

**I digress. So, this tree is once again seen looming around in the background of Charlie and the MCI kid's gravestones. This time we can actually see it in full, and now we can see that compared to the other trees, it is large and out of place. To be clear, none of this is literal, this is all just metaphors, representations, and weird cryptic shit. I'm not describing a literal-physical tree, I am just listing off the details and things-of-note about this** ***Graveyard Tree.***

# The Storyteller Tree

Ok, The Storyteller is probably the tree with the clearest importance. It has a whole story about it, it is how The Mimic gets into the Pizzaplex, it is how Edwin dies, etc. First, I should explain what The Storyteller actually is.

One day, likely in March 2033, the Board of Directors for Fazbear Entertainment LLC has an idea for a new attraction at The Pizzaplex. This idea is The Storyteller Tree. The idea behind it is an AI that can infinitely produce stories for kids. However, despite Edwin's objections, they want to use the Mimic1 Program for it. The Storyteller is placed right in the center of the pizzaplex, is looks like a huge plastic baobab tree. The trunk is **75 feet tall** and **55 feet wide.** The branches up top spread out like a ""fifty-foot-wide umbrella"". That is a **HUGE** tree. People never mention it, but this tree is gargantuan. The trunk is bright yellow, the branches are rainbow, and its roots are multi-colored LED wires. The roots of the tree are actually what connects it to the rest of the Pizzaplex. Inside of The Storyteller, there is a large mass of thick black wires, with a White Tiger head sticking out of it. From the White Tiger head, LED drape down, covering the floor. The computer terminal for The Storyteller is very small and found on one of the walls. It is unknown why there is a large pile of wires. Inevitably, when they connect it to the Pizzaplex network, The Storyteller goes rouge. Infecting and altering everything in the whole pizzaplex. By the end of the story, Edwin and Mr. Burrows die of suffocation inside of The Storyteller, after it locked them in airtight. Soon after The Storyteller is removed, however the AI likely still lingers in the Pizzaplex, and the mass of wires likely ended up becoming The Tangle.

So that's all fine and dandy, but why am I bringing it up? Isn't this supposed to be about the subtle background themes with the trees in Fnaf? Because The Storyteller is not subtle nor a background character at all. Well I don't want to talk about The Storyteller as a character, as a contributor to the plot, its origins, or anything like that. I want to look at the *why* of The Storyteller. Why was it made to be the way it is by Scott? Sure you might say that it is just a creative idea mixed with some randomness, but I think that there *might* be more to that.

First of all, The Storyteller is specifically called out to be a Baobab Tree. This type of tree is known for one specific reason, they are The Tree of Life. I will elaborate on what that actually means later, but for right now all you need to know is that the Baobab Trees are The Trees of Life, and that The Storyteller was likely made a Baobab Tree for that specific reason. But then you have the question of, why did they even make it a tree in the first place? That is such an odd thing to make it, as every other variation of the Mimic has some relevance, but this is just a tree? Yes, you have the Tree of Life thing, but the fact that it is a Baobab Tree is only because they wanted to make it a tree in the first place. Sorry if I'm not being clear enough, so let me put it like this. Scott wanted this variation of the Mimic to be a tree (for reasons we will soon go over), he wanted to add extra importance to this tree, so he chose arguably the most famous tree-type ever (The Tree of Life).

Ok getting back on track to the main question, why is The Storyteller specifically a tree? Well that's just it, it is a **storyteller**. A tree fits perfectly with the description of a storyteller. Think about it. Trees are usually depicted as old and wise, filled with stories dating back decades, or even centuries. Most of the time in fiction, if you go into a forest and meet a tree, it will tell you stories and tales. **Trees are old and wise storytellers.** This fits even better when you realize that Baobab Trees are what they are because they live for centuries.

**So, The Storyteller Tree is one of the most important variations of The Mimic Program. It is depicted as a Baobab Tree, otherwise known as The Tree of Life. This old tree, a symbol of life itself, is a wise story-teller, filled with tales \[from the pizzaplex\].**

# The Tree of Life

Remember when I said that the graveyard is the only place in the Princess Quest Minigames that has trees? Well that was a bit of a white lie. Truth is, there is *one other* tree in PQ, and that is The Tree of Life. See, above the door that leads to Glitchtrap, there is a very distinct looking baobab tree mural. So I wasn't fully lying, it's true that the graveyard is the only place that has *real* trees, I just left out this mural. Do you forgive me? Yes you do.

So a Baobab Tree, The Tree of Life? Yes, this mural is an obvious reference to The Storyteller, and hell is probably the first actual appearance of The Storyteller in the games. But I bring this up because outside of being a reference to The Storyteller, this also is clearly distinct.

Remember when I said I would elaborate on the meaning of The Tree of Life? Here we are. The Tree of Life is meant to represent life, and how everything living thing is subtly interconnected. A literal embodiment of life itself. It is depicted as a Baobab Tree due to the fact that baobabs can live for centuries, are quite large, and grow nutrient-dense fruit. The Tree of Life, or the world tree, are present in many different religions, beliefs, cultures, and folklore across the world. Often being a divine, holy, or sacred figure. They usually are figures of wisdom, life, immortality (in some cases), knowledge, and nourishment. This further lines up with The Storyteller, as once again, it is a tree commonly associated with wisdom and knowledge (meaning stories/tales that need to be told).

However with life, inherently comes death. Although being The Tree of **Life,** life always ends with death. The Tree of Life is also a representation of the cycle of life, which includes both birth and death. It is one of the few things that connects every living thing on Earth. It is what should be expected when dealing with a ""*Tree of Life*"". One of the most distinct details about this tree from PQ is that it is half blooming, and half dead. Exactly 50/50 down the middle. Yet another representation, much clearer this time, of Life and Death. Creation and Destruction. Light and Dark. Good and Bad. This is also probably supposed to be tied with the main plot, of The Mimic being split in two, M1 (mostly good intentions), and M2 (mostly bad intentions).

**These are all very... ubiquitous themes, right? Almost universal, or divine even. Do you see what I am hinting at? I have been building up to it the whole time. A figure that is associated with one of the most famous religious themes of all time, associated with the cycle of life, omnipresent throughout the entire story from beginning to end. Doesn't that sound almost.... god-like? So here is my theory: The God of the Fnaf Universe is, or at least is represented by, a tree. It is omnipresent, ancient, and doesn't actually care too much. It is an absent god, not caring what happens to it's creations, only caring that things do continue to happen.**

I have one last thing to note about the mural before moving on. Under neath the tree there is what looks to be like ten graves, five on each side. This is once again another call back to the ending of FFPS and the signature *Tree on The Hill*. Each side of the tree, both the living side and the dead side, have five graves. I don't know exactly what that could mean, or even if it has any relevance at all. But to with that what you will. Because I know people will bring it up, yes this could also be the wall of a castle. But really it just comes down to what you see. In my opinion it looks more like graves, but you might disagree, and that's fine. If it is a castle wall, then that means that the tree is on top of a castle wall. Which is just weird. It doesn't really matter all too much though.

**Ok so, this Tree of Life is a very clear callback to The Storyteller, but it also has some extra meaning. It is a representation of Life and Death, divinity, a crucial part of the main story, and possibly more ties to the graves.**

# The Shadow Tree

This is what gave me the idea for this post/theory in the first place. In the Happiest Day Minigames, there is this *Shadow Tree*. In these minigames there are a ton of different Shadow Creatures, and just shadows in general. But this one stands out to me.

First of all, it is the only non-Fazbear adjacent Shadow. We see Shadow BB, Shadow Puppet, RWQ (Shadow Bonnie), Shadow Cupcake, and in another Fnaf 3 minigame we see Shadow Freddy. All of them are *shadow-ified* Fazbear characters, except for the tree. Look, maybe I'm wrong, and maybe this tree is just a normal Shadow Creature just like the others from the Happiest Day Minigames. Or it is something entirely different. For example, there is the theory that[ all Shadow Creatures are birthed from this Shadow Tree](https://www.reddit.com/r/fnaftheories/comments/1evgfgp/i_think_this_shadow_tree_in_the_digitalspiritual/). It's interesting, but not exactly likely in my opinion.

We learn in TUG that these areas of the Happiest Day minigames are called The Sunken Place. I'd say it's fairly likely that The Sunken Place is a part of The Spirit World. So I think it is important to note that Shadow BB, Shadow Puppet, Shadow Cupcake, and The Shadow Tree are only seen in The Sunken Place, and rarely have the ability to move. That makes me think that something is different between them and other Shadow Creatures like RWQ, Nightmare, and Eleanor.

Either way, even if this Shadow Tree is something else, the fact that it is a tree specifically (again) stands out to me. With all we have talked about before, all that stuff about Life and Death, about the Beginnings and Endings of stories, about always existing in the background, and now we see a tree chilling in the Spirit Realm? Thats got to mean something. What does it mean? Well my interpretation is that it exists everywhere, omnipresence. Through life and death, even when it may seem like the story is already over, it is still there, just looming in the background. It doesn't just exist in the real world, or in minigames, murals, pizzaplex attractions, or graffiti, but even in the Spirit World.

**So, this** ***Shadow Tree*** **exists in The Sunken Place, a part of the Spirit World that is crawling with Shadow Creatures. Through life and death, through the beginning of a story, and that stories end, the tree is always there. Even in the spirit realm, you can't escape it, it is omnipresent.**

# The Fourth Closet Tree

At the very end of The Fourth Closet, we see this tree. It is a normal tree in a green-hilly graveyard.

As has been seen time and time again, this tree is once again in the presence of an ending. This is the last we see of the Novel Continuity, and of course, the tree is there. We don’t know exactly what happens after this, but we can presume it was a new fresh-start on life for John and whoever was standing under the tree. So, as expected, the tree is there whenever a story ends and themes of freedom are around.

It is supposed to be an obvious tie in to the ending of FFPS. In FFPS, we have Charlie grave underneath the tree in a green hilly landscape. The children have been set free, and their story is over. In TFC, we have Charlie’s grave next to the tree in a green landscape. John is given the opportunity and freedom to start over, and maybe so is the woman who was under the tree. Regardless, it is the end of the story in the Novel Continuity.

Yes, I know the Graphic Novel shows that it is Charlie under the tree, but the OG book doesn’t. It’s just a woman who takes John’s hand (iirc). The ending of the Graphic Novels where we see secret-Adult Charlie is purely the artist’s interpretation. And I’m glad because that would be one confusing and odd way to end the story. I’d prefer to think that the woman was Mrs. Emily, but I guess we’ll never know.

**""All roads lead to Rome"", this tree appears only at the very end of The Fourth Closet. Not just being the end of the story, but the end of the entire continuity as a whole. Although we don't know for a fact what happens after this, we can assume it is John's fresh-start on life, freedom to do whatever he wants.**

# Foxy.EXE Tree

In Fnaf World, there is a minigame called Foxy.EXE. In this minigame, the ""desktop screen"" at the beginning is where we find the tree again.

The beginning of Foxy.EXE is meant to look like a computer desktop, and is clearly an homage to the famous Windows Desktop Background. The difference though is that Foxy.EXE has a single tree centered in the middle of the screen. Clearly this is supposed to be in the same vain as the FFPS Tree, SB Tree, etc. Another tree on top of a green hill. However unlike the others, this was the first. Foxy.EXE is the first time Scott came up with this idea of a tree on a green hill.

**Not really much of note other than this being another case of a tree on top of a green hill. I'm kinda realizing that it's everywhere now.**

# Bear of Vengeance Tree

In UCN, there are Intermission Cutscenes showing different ""episodes of shows"". One of these shows is The Bear of Vengeance. One of the locations in TBOV that we see is a tree atop a green hill/cliff.

This tree looks just like the tree from the FFPS Ending, and is in a similar location. This time, probably due to TBOV being an anime, it is highly exaggerated. Instead of being a large-ish hill among many, it is a large, pointed, green cliff in the center of a mountain range.

This is where The Bear does most of his talking. Usually talking about how he's gonna get The Fox. but most notably about his defeats. We see the most of the tree when The Bear is saying how he has been embarrassed by The Fox.

**Once again just another case of this specific tree on top of a green hill. I feel like the important part is less about what each trees meaning is, and more of just how often this specific tree and setting shows up.**

# Toy Chica: The Highschool Years Tree

In UCN, there are Intermission Cutscenes showing different ""episodes of shows"". One of these shows is Toy Chica: The Highschool Years. One of the locations in TCHSY that we see is a tree in a green hilly field.

Same type of tree we see in TBOV, except this time in the opposite environment. Instead of it being exaggerated and high up, the hill-aspect is nearly entirely gone. It is just a vibrant, bumpy, green field with some small hills in the background. It's the same type of environment, but it's odd that TBOV and TCHSY are polar opposites. TBOV exaggerates, TCHSY underexaggerates.

In the context of TCHSY, the tree appears at the very end where Toy Chica is talking about how none of her attempts with boys worked out. Aka, William Afton after killing the MCI talking about how he's gonna do it again someday (DCI). Really the most important thing to note here is that it's at the end.

**So once again, this specific type of tree in a green and hilly environment, with someone sitting underneath it. And it's at the end of another story.**

# The Tree of Life (again)

In SB, at the end of Rockstar Row, there is a broken stone pillar with the Tree of Life engrained on it.

In Rockstar Row, at the end there is a little section of cardboard cutouts. It is supposed to be the ""spooky section"", in a similar vein to the setting of Curse of Dreadbear. There is cardboard cutouts of Phantom Freddy, Ennard, Bonnie, Plushtrap, Nightmare BB, a couple gravestones, a Water Tower, Pumpkins, PlushBabys, Shadow Bonnie, and a dead tree. At the base of the dead tree, next to Shadow Bonnie, there is a stone pillar-like thing. That stone pillar thing has a circle with The Tree of Life engrained into it. The pillar is made of cardboard just like all the others, but it is meant to look like stone, and is broken off in a way that stone would instead of cardboard.

Now, I'm not exactly sure what this pillar is supposed to be. My first thought was a grave, but we see other cardboard graves that look completely different and more traditional. Then I thought maybe a location marker of some kind, but that feels kinda arbitrary. Regardless, it is at the base of a dead tree, looks to be made of stone (not really but it is intended to look that way), is broken and laying on it's back, and is hidden behind other cutouts. It also appears to be rotting or old, as it is dirty.

The main important detail is The Tree of Life that is engrained on it. It's just such an odd detail to add, that once again gives this thing importance that you wouldn't think it should have. The fact that it is at the base of a dead tree, is broken, is maybe a grave, and has The Tree of Life on it is the important details. As for what it means. I'm not sure. Maybe just the death part of the circle of life. Regardless, more important tree/tree of life stuff.

**Another depiction of The Tree of Life. I am now realizing how often it comes up in Fnaf, and that leaves me to wonder how this flew under our radar? I have never seen anyone else talk about it despite how often and important it is. Anyways, a broken stone pillar engrained with The Tree of Life, sitting at the base of a dead tree.**

# The Moon.EXE Trees

In SOTM, when playing Moon.EXE, you can encounter two different trees with faces on them off the side of the path.

I thought these were worth mentioning, but I will say this now that they aren't that notable. Moon.EXE is a pile of metaphors and lore, so this was the first place I looked when finding more GodTree evidence. Surprisingly all that I was able to find was two seemingly unimportant trees with faces on them. Nonetheless, I will talk about them both.

The first tree is the Scary Tree. It is directly outside of the window to the house you start in. It doesn't have any leaves, has an angry face on it's trunk, and has a bird nest on it. In the bird nest is a Party Time Chica Vacuum Cup. Using a ranger army knife that you get later, you can cut off the tree's branch.

Second is The Oak Tree. In front of the Oak Tree is a gator trying to eat a baby owl. The Oak Tree is off to the side of the path and has a frowning face. When we find it, it is in pain and groaning due to a ranger army knife in it. When we pull the knife out, the tree smiles and is in relief. Just after we leave and go meet Old Lady Sun, when we come back the Oak Tree has a Fredbear's Singin' Show record nailed onto it, the tree is in pain again. **Also, correct me if I'm wrong but, are the trees all oak? Like now that I'm looking at it, most of the trees (that aren't Baobabs) look to be Oak Trees? Right?**

So that's the Scary Tree and The Oak Tree in Moon.EXE. I don't exactly know what they could mean, but I'm pretty sure that they have significance. I have a few ideas on what they could be:

1. We play as David in Moon.EXE, the trees represent Edwin and Fiona, his two parents. Edwin being the scary one who is blocking David from danger, but isn't actually doing anything to stop him. Meanwhile Fiona is always getting the consequences of or hurt because of other people's actions.
2. The trees represent M1 and M2. M2 is the scary one, always getting people hurt (broken branch), and is surrounded by death (no leaves). He was originally meant to be David (Baby Owl), but is a husk of what he was supposed to be (empty bird nest). The oak tree is M1, the one with good intentions that never work. She tries to do the right thing and be good, but no matter what, she and the people around her always end up hurt.
3. The trees represent William and Henry. William is the scary one, always getting people hurt (broken branch), and is surrounded by death (no leaves). Henry is the oak tree, always trying to do the right thing, but gets hurt and suffers the consequences of William's actions.

Or they are there to just reinforce the idea that trees are important/alive. I don't know.

**So, a Scary Tree and an Oak Tree, one with an angry face, and one with a frowning face. You can save the Oak Tree, but it still ends up getting hurt regardless. The Scary Tree is dead and intimidating. These two might represent characters like Edwin and Fiona, William and Henry, or M1 and M2, although it is unclear.**

# Oliver The Oak Tree

In Coming Home, there is an oak tree in Susie's backyard that Susie and Samantha name Oliver The Oak Tree.

Oliver the Oak Tree is odd. Throughout Coming Home, Oliver's leaves are slowly falling off (because it's Fall). But the weird thing is that once all the leaves fall off Oliver, Susie is forced to leave. Susie wanders her home as a poltergeist for over a year, once she learns that she is dead, a countdown begins. This countdown is Oliver's leaves falling off, and it is counting down to when Susie has to leave. It's implied that Susie leaving means being taken to Freddy's to possess Chica, and letting go of her old life. This is some pretty in-your-face implication too, considering that Chica literally comes to her house to drag Susie to Freddy's.

Now the question is, why is Susie's countdown Oliver's leaves? Well, the way that the story paints it makes it sound like a part of Susie's soul is in Oliver.... Which is weird, but it actually makes a ton of sense when you think about it. Firstly, how is Susie a poltergeist/wandering spirit? Well she doesn't know she's dead, but how? I mean it's kinda hard to not realize that unless you die under certain conditions, that of which Susie wasn't. So how didn't she realize she was dead? Because her soul was broken, split between Chica and Oliver. In a less literal sense, it's Chica VS Oliver. Chica representing Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, Susie's ""new home"", Oliver representing Susie's Home.

Another interesting thing is that the story kinda implies that Chica is the half of Susie's soul that remembers her death, is possessing Chica, and is in Agony. Meanwhile the main character is the half of Susie's soul that is peaceful, oblivious, innocent, and attached to Oliver through the power of love/joy (Emotional Impression). And that the story ends with Susie's soul being made whole again in a flash of light. Susie ends up leaving her home to go to her new home, so instead of Susie continuing to possess Oliver or remain as a poltergeist, she is fully taken to Freddy's (where we see her possess Chica, leading to her appearance in Fnaf 2 and Fnaf 1).

Anyways, I mainly want to focus on Oliver. Once again, and he is an oak tree like all the others. Technically this is the second time we have seen Susie and an oak tree connected (first time being in the FFPS ending with the graves). Once again, a tree put in the spotlight, relating to the supernatural, being an oak tree, etc. Nothing all too notable other than his role in the story, and the fact that he has an actual name.

**To recap, in Coming Home Susie names a oak tree in her backyard ""Oliver the Oak Tree'. She Emotionally Imprinted on it, when she died, her soul was split between Chica and Oliver. The part of her in Chica realized she was dead and was angry, meanwhile the part in Oliver didn't know that she was dead (became a poltergeist) and was friendly. There is also the possibility that** **GodTree's name is Oliver, or Oliver The Storyteller.**

# DIAAARACAD

I thought this was worth mentioning, but be fair warned that this one is just fun speculation.

In FFPS, there is a grave underneath the tree. We can assume this is Charlie's, but under closer inspection, it actually says ""*DIAAARACAD*"". Is it possible that this is the name of GodTree? It certainly sounds like a more godly name then Oliver, so yeah maybe his name is Diaaaracad.

Something else of note, if you translate the first part of DIAAARACAD, ""*Dia*"", into Scots Gaelic, you get ""God"".

Regardless, the grave is 100% supposed to be Charlie's, and ""DIAAARACAD"" is just placeholder text that you're not supposed to see.

**This one is really more of a fun headcanon. I can imagine this god saying ""My true name is DIAAARACAD, but you can call me Oliver.""**

# Narrative Parallels

Another thing I thought would be worth bringing up is all the weird narrative parallels. And how they might indicate a higher force, a storyteller even, carving the story.

First, I'll show the Striped-Shirt Kids:

|Striped-Shirt Kids|David Murray|BV|Gregory|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Associated Animatronics:|The Mimic|Fredbear|Glamrock Freddy|
|Carry-around:|White Tiger Plush|Fredbear Plush|Glamrock Freddy's Head|
|Guardian Figure:|F10-N4|Glitchbear|Vanessa|
|Killed by:|The Mimic|Fredbear|Glamrock Freddy??|
|Possesses:|The White Tiger|Fredbear|???|
|Date of Death:|6th Birthday|7th Birthday|8th Birthday??|

Next, I'll show a ""theory"" called SteelMadness. It's less of a theory and more of just an observation, but anyways here:

|Fnaf World|Steel Wool Game|
|:-|:-|
|Into Madness|BB's Air Adventure|
|Halloween Land|FallFest 83'|
|Tangle|Tangle|
|The White Rabbit|Vanny|
|Old Man Consequences|The King \[OMC\]|
|The Fourth Glitch|The Red Underground Lake|
|Bubba|Bub|
|Foxy.EXE|Eclipse in BB's Air Adventure|
|Coffee|Stay Up Latte'|
|Bouncepot|Test Tube Terrier|
|Virtual Freddy|AR Roxy|

Finally, here are just some general narrative parallels that pop up all the time. In both old and new Fnaf:

* M2 Stuffing People - William Stuffing People - Animatronics Stuff People
* The Bite of 83' - The Bite of 87' - Civil No. 834710865
* The Bite of 83' (Fredbear bites striped-shirt kid's head) - PQ Ending (Striped-shirt kid bites Freddy's head)
* The Bite of 87' (animatronic bites off Jeremy Fitzgerald's forehead) - HW (Jeremy's face is cut off)
* Fiona FallFest Fire - MCM Fire - FallFest 83' Fire - Fnaf 3 Fire - FFPS Fire - SB Fire
* **The Constant Depiction of Trees on Green Hills**
* Edwin's Queen's Anne Mansion Burning Down - Vlad's Queen's Anne Mansion Burning Down
* The Yellow Rabbit Man (William killing people wearing a rabbit suit) - Vanny (Vanessa killing people wearing a rabbit suit
* Glitchtrap's Character as a Whole (repeating everything William did)
* The SCUPER - The Fazbear Scooper
* Missing Children's Incident - Dead Children's Incident - Missing Residents Incident

There is a lot more, but all that gives you a good picture of how prevalent this theme is in Fnaf. It feels too prevalent to not have an explanation, right? Sure you could chalk it up to meta-narrative-themes, that is completely valid and is what I did for the longest time. But I am just going to throw out this idea, what if all this happens because of a higher power? What if the reason these themes are so prevalent/repetitive is because someone is literally making the story to be that way in-universe? They would be God, right? A storyteller? Right??

**Fnaf is littered with narrative parallels, themes, ""history rhymes/repeats itself"" motifs, etc. Although much of this is probably just meta, there is a possibility that there is an in-universe explanation as well. That a storyteller god is carving the story to be this way. Similar to FateFiona or MemoryVictim, except not horrible (I'm joking I love you MemoryVictim, FateFiona sucks tho).**

# The Narrative Themes of Trees in general

I thought that I might as well just bring this up before the end of this post.

Trees in fiction are usually associated with things like longevity (they are all really old), the connection between The Old World (Nature) and The New World (Humanity), having wisdom, being filled with different stories that need to be told, and being on an almost different plane of consciousness.

I would like to focus on ""*the connection between The Old World (Nature) and The New World (Humanity)*"" and ""*being on an almost different plane of consciousness*"" for a little bit. What does that sound like to you? Something that is so wise and old that their mind is on a different plane of consciousness. Being so old and have seen so much that you are considered a link between worlds. To me that sounds like a deity. Something more than Human, or less than Human, depending how you look at it. A literal connection between the physical and non-physical worlds.

**Sorry I don't have much to say here. This section was kind of just the leftovers that couldn't fit in with the other parts of this post. Really there are many many different narrative themes about trees, and I covered a lot of them. It may not seem like it, but that's because these few are just the ones I hadn't already talked about. All the other ones are spread out all throughout this post.**

# Conclusion

So, this is probably my favorite posts/theories of mine. So far from what I have seen you guys also think this is good stuff. So thank you <3.

**TLDR: In Fnaf, God is real, and he is named Diaaaracad, or Oliver The Storyteller for short. Oliver only has one real goal, to observe. He crafts his worlds in specific ways so that interesting stories will play out. He makes history rhyme for the sake of recurring narrative themes. He sits back and watches as people go through the most agonizing pains, and most happy moments. In reality, he doesn't care about what happens to his creations. He is a storyteller and a creator, nothing more, nothing less. Could be a sad story, a happy story, a fun story, or a horror story. Doesn't matter. It is god, it is always watching, it is in different to what goes on in it's universe, and it is a tree. Oliver is usually represented by a tree. Specifically two types of trees. Baobab Tress (The Tree of Life), or an Oak Tree on a green-grassy hill.**

Now, how likely is GodTree? Honestly I don't know. If it is canon, then I feel like it might be one of those things that Scott is hesitant to show, almost like The Box. I think Scott is fully capable of setting up important plot points over the course of \~10 years, but maybe something of this magnitude is a bit absurd. Or maybe it isn't a fully fleshed out concept, but just an idea in the back of his head that he tries to implement when he can.

Yes, I am aware of how batshit insane this theory is. I called it a crackpot theory for a reason. That is one of the reasons I love GodTree too, and is probably why other people like it as well (because of how absurdly ridiculous it sounds).

Sometime after this post comes out I will be adding GodTree, AndrewTree, SteelMadness, and The Remaining Consequences Theory (proposed by u/sac_112 in the comments of my last post) to the[ Fnaf Theories Wiki.](https://fnaftheories.fandom.com/wiki/FNAF_Theories_Wiki) I won't do it right now, or probably anytime soon, but I do want to add it at some point.

One last thing that I just found interesting. I have said the work ""tree"" a total of 225 times in this post. So, that's cool.

It's 1999 - 2001, Central Coast of California, I had a friend with very eclectic, almost alt/ambient downtempo taste in music. He introduced me to Bjork, Morcheeba, and this one group that wasn't a rock band, though they def had drums and cymbals and light guitar:

To describe by comparison, it's like ""Toro y Moi takes on 60s shoegaze"" or something like that.

It was very light and melodic -- but substantial. It wasn't background music. It was def in the foreground, but unobtrusive. You could listen to it AND hold a conversation. You could be hung over from ecstasy or alcohol the night before and this would be like auditory valium for a quite day on a sunny back porch in a tree-lined backyard. Very ""sitting in the grass in a good but lowkey mood"" music.

Heavy female vocals that were very light and dreamy and had this very retro element. It was very reminiscient of the 60s.

They must've been British, American, or Canadian. Not AUS or NZ. Def an English-speaking group.

They would've probably been considered kinda alt or fringe or underground at the time, and I can't think of any other group that occupied this particular genre at the time. They would've been kinda Portishead-adjacent.

GOD IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY. Every few years I spend an afternoon going through google searches, youtube videos, and subreddit trying to find the right combo of keywords or band name.

Their ""band"" name was 2 or 3 words -- something kinda snappy. Like, everytime my friend said what they were call I was always like 'I SHOULD be able to remember that but somehow I always forget.' It was a cute/witty name that def matched their music style.

Hey there! I've never been the best at these but if I'm calling myself a writer, I can't exactly back down from this!

I'm a 29 year old artist, writer, avid hiker, and current masters student for Higher Education Leadership; my end game is to be some sort of executive type at a university and go to WAR for my educators and students against the awful, anti-intellectualism nonsense going on right now, ensuring they get what they need and my school fricking rocks. I want to write and make good art that encourages people to engage with their lives and their imaginations.

I also very much want to find the black cat to my golden retriever! I managed to get through all of my twenties without that, but now I think I want to build a life with someone that we can grow in and make our own. Tell me about your dreams, your hopes, what you dislike and like; what's your favorite meal? I'll bet you I can learn how to make it exactly the way you like (but if it's like, fugu, maybe I shouldn't? Don't ask the nuerospicy, untrained home cook to prepare the tetrodotoxin)

I can't guess what anyone's dynamic would be like, so I'll just list off some of the things that get me up in the morning : Coffee -- okay that's it. For things I like, writing, anime and animations, Pokemon, art, museums, aquariums, martial arts, hiking and strength training, being crafty and DIYs, new and good food, cooking, music (I've been enjoying metal lately, but also lofi - I contain multitudes) cultures from the world over, trail running (haven't been in forever) and being near the water. There's definitely more but, you've got things to do, I'll tell you about the rest as it comes up or over that boba I lured you in with.

That's it for now methinks <3 Thanks for reading and, I hope we get to chat soon!

1n5dpxk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5dpxk,First Brisket,"I finally decided to go in the deep end in the pool of smoking meat, by smoking a brisket. I cooked it on a Weber Kettle, with post oak/charcoal (I also have an Only Fire ceramic insert that I used) Family gave it solid reviews, but I think there’s definitely room for improvement, flavor wise. When I try again, I definitely want to season the meat heavier. I made up a seasoning mix of kosher salt, pepper, granulated garlic, granulated onion, and celery seed, that went on all sides. I then went over the fat cap with a coffee based run I found at Aldi. I used Holy Cow on the other side. 

My process was to season the meat the day before and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I put it on the smoker at 9:30. I used a #6 cast iron pan as a water pan. Temps started out low around 200, and then they jumped to 300 (they stayed between 275-300 the entire cook). I think next time I’ll cut down the post oak sticks, into chunks to better control the temps. I spritzed it when it hit 100 degrees (idk why, I just figured that was a good temp to spritz it). I wrapped it around 1:30am in butcher paper and talo. It hit 200 around 3am and I let it rest in the oven at 170 until 4pm when we ate dinner. 

Things I would do differently. Other than seasoning more and adjusting the size of the wood chunks, I think I would use a foil boat (along with the butcher paper). The paper ripped a little when I was trying to take the brisket off the grill, spilling some of the fat into the grill. Does anyone else use both, or is that a bad idea? Best part about the whole experience, is my kid asked me if he could stay up with me, while I smoked the brisket. He made it til about 2am before he tapped out. I made sure he got the first slice for hanging out with the old man. ",9,1756696065.0,brisket,4,0.91,False

I’m so sorry!!! Just being real!! I do have 2 cats but they are indoor and most of this was sitting in a storage closet. Non-Smoking household!

1.) Crash Pad for sensory-seeking kids. My kiddo didn’t like that the foam inside was in cubes, so hopefully another fan can use it! My guess is it’s around 4’ x 3’.

2.) This is just a really heavily used box for stuff. There’s no shelving or organizers inside, just a SUPER sturdy but ragged tool box I moved on from. Will need a wipe down inside! 

3.) Pull ups for slightly older kids. This is a mix of “Sleepovers” Brand pull ups (unisex, plain white, pretty soft!) I have 6-7 packets of these, then a bunch of Ninjamas in size M-L my son is 8 and around 65-70 lbs for reference. They would fit someone who was 5-6 probably too though. Also a little stack of Bluey 6T pull-ups. 

4.) Two framed abstract pieces of wall art from Target. It was a set of 3, one broke. Idk the size but not huge not tiny? 

5.) Unopened Squatty potty. Get your excellent poop game on. 

6.) Motor oil. Both are full-ish. 

7.)Weight Gurus scale, this this connects with your phone so you can diversify the ways it ruins your body image daily! Takes 3x AAA batteries and is missing the battery cover. The batteries do fine staying in on their own but you could throw a piece of tape over the openings if you are fancy. 

8.) 7x10 checkered ivory/beige rug. It was rolled out in my living room for about three weeks. It’s a great rug, but in the end I decided checkers were too busy for my house. I did drop a smidge of iced coffee on it, but it landed on one of the beige spots and honestly, you just can’t tell. 

9.) hanging cuddle swing for sensory seekers or autistic kiddos. This isn’t the exact one but it’s very close.  Can be hung from the ceiling, but also up for grabs is a kit to hang it from your door frame. 

10.) two different 2 pieces sets of light filtering linen-type Terra Cotta/Clay tab top curtains, the measurements should be in the pic. They are slightly different shades, the ones that are a zoomed in pic are a bit darker 


Thanks all, DM me if you’re headed out to pick anything up, I will do my best to cross things off the list as they become unavailable :-)

## What Does It Really Mean to Be a Grown-Up? 🤔

We all know someone who's technically an adult but acts like they're still figuring out how to tie their shoes. Age doesn't automatically grant wisdom, and having a mortgage doesn't make you mature. True maturity is something entirely different – it's about how we think, react, and navigate the messy reality of everyday life.

Real maturity shows up in the small moments: when your colleague takes credit for your idea, when your neighbor's dog keeps you awake at night, or when your favorite restaurant gets your order completely wrong. It's in these ordinary situations that we discover whether we've truly grown up or if we're still throwing invisible tantrums.

## Breaking Free from Black-and-White Thinking 🎨

One of the biggest signs of emotional growth is learning to see the world in full color instead of just black and white. When we're young (or emotionally young), everything feels absolute. People are either completely good or entirely evil. Decisions are either perfect or disasters. Political parties are either saints or devils.

But reality is far more nuanced. Your boss might be brilliant at strategy but terrible at communication. Your best friend could be incredibly loyal yet chronically unreliable. That restaurant you love might have amazing food but awful service. Learning to hold these contradictions without your brain short-circuiting is a superpower worth developing.

**Daily Practice:** Next time you catch yourself thinking ""always"" or ""never"" about someone or something, pause and ask: ""What's the more complex truth here?"" You'll be surprised how often there's a middle ground you hadn't considered.

## Staying Cool When Things Get Hot 🧊

We've all been there – that moment when someone pushes exactly the wrong button and you feel your blood pressure spike. Maybe it's a passive-aggressive text from your ex, a condescending comment from a family member, or getting stuck behind the world's slowest driver when you're already running late.

Emotional maturity isn't about never feeling angry, frustrated, or hurt. It's about maintaining your ability to think clearly even when your emotions are doing backflips. It's the difference between reacting and responding.

**The 24-Hour Rule:** When something really gets under your skin, give yourself 24 hours before taking any major action. Send that angry email to your drafts folder. Put down the phone before firing off that sarcastic response. Sleep on that big decision. You'll be amazed how different things look after your emotional storm has passed.

## Accepting the Good, Bad, and Ugly in Everyone 👥

Here's a uncomfortable truth: everyone you know has the capacity for both kindness and cruelty, generosity and selfishness, wisdom and foolishness. Yes, even your favorite person. Yes, even you.

This doesn't mean we should excuse harmful behavior or lower our standards. It means we can hold space for complexity. Your partner can be incredibly supportive and occasionally thoughtless. Your parent can be loving and also carry baggage that sometimes affects how they treat you. Your friend can be hilarious and fun while also being unreliable when it counts.

**Reality Check Exercise:** Think of someone who really annoys you. Now list three genuinely positive things about them. Then think of someone you adore and acknowledge one area where they're not perfect. This isn't about making excuses – it's about seeing people as whole human beings rather than cartoon characters.

## The Humility Factor 🙏

Nothing screams emotional immaturity quite like someone who thinks they have all the answers. We live in an age where everyone's an expert after reading a few articles online, where people argue passionately about topics they learned about five minutes ago.

Mature people know what they don't know. They're comfortable saying ""I'm not sure about that"" or ""I need to think about it more."" They change their minds when presented with new information instead of doubling down on positions that no longer make sense.

**Conversation Starter:** Instead of jumping in with your opinion, try asking questions first. ""Help me understand your perspective on this"" or ""What led you to that conclusion?"" You'll learn more, argue less, and people will actually enjoy talking with you.

## Walking Softly Through Life's Chaos 🚶‍♂️

Life has a way of serving up situations that test every ounce of patience you thought you had. Your flight gets canceled during a family emergency. Your teenager decides to experiment with purple hair the day before school photos. Your carefully planned project falls apart because of factors completely outside your control.

Emotional maturity shows up in how gently you move through these inevitable frustrations. It's about responding to life's curveballs with grace instead of drama, finding solutions instead of someone to blame.

**The Pause Practice:** Before reacting to any frustrating situation, take three deep breaths and ask yourself: ""Will this matter in five years? Five months? Five days?"" This simple question can save you from wasting energy on things that really don't deserve your emotional investment.

## Extending the Benefit of the Doubt ❤️

In our hyperconnected world, it's easy to assume the worst about people. That friend who didn't respond to your text must be ignoring you. The cashier who seems grumpy must be rude. The driver who cut you off must be a selfish jerk.

But what if your friend's phone died during a family crisis? What if the cashier just got some devastating news? What if that driver is rushing to the hospital? We usually don't know the full story behind other people's behavior, so why not assume positive intent until proven otherwise?

**Daily Kindness Challenge:** Once a day, actively choose to give someone the benefit of the doubt. When someone seems short with you, assume they're having a rough day rather than taking it personally. You'll find yourself feeling less frustrated and more connected to the people around you.

## Nobody Has All the Answers 📚

One of the most liberating realizations of adulthood is that nobody – absolutely nobody – has figured it all out. That confident person at work? They're winging it too. Your successful neighbor? They have moments of complete confusion. Your parents? They were making it up as they went along, just like you are now.

This isn't depressing – it's freeing. It means you can stop pretending to have answers you don't have. It means you can ask for help without feeling inadequate. It means you can admit mistakes without your world falling apart.

## Building Your Support Network 🤝

Since none of us have all the answers, we need each other. Mature people understand that asking for help isn't weakness – it's strategy. They build relationships before they need them. They offer support to others, knowing that what goes around comes around.

**Network Building Tip:** Instead of only reaching out when you need something, make it a habit to check in on people regularly. Send a ""thinking of you"" text. Offer to help with a project. Celebrate their wins. Strong relationships are built on mutual support, not emergency requests.

## The Daily Practice of Growing Up 🌟

Emotional maturity isn't a destination you reach and then coast. It's a daily practice, like physical fitness or learning a musical instrument. Some days you'll nail it, other days you'll react like you're still in middle school. That's normal and human.

**Your Maturity Workout:**
- Question your absolute thoughts
- Pause before reacting emotionally  
- Look for complexity in simple situations
- Practice humility in conversations
- Choose kindness when you could choose criticism
- Ask for help when you need it
- Offer support to others

## Why This Matters More Than Ever 🌍

In a world that often rewards the loudest voice, the quickest judgment, and the most extreme position, choosing emotional maturity is almost radical. It's choosing depth over surface, understanding over being understood, connection over being right.

These aren't just nice ideas – they're practical life skills that will improve your relationships, reduce your stress, and make you someone others actually want to be around. They'll help you navigate workplace politics, family dynamics, and friendship challenges with more ease and less drama.

## The Long View 🔭

The beautiful thing about developing emotional maturity is that it keeps paying dividends. The patience you develop today will serve you when you're dealing with aging parents tomorrow. The humility you practice now will help you adapt to changes you can't even imagine yet. The kindness you show to difficult people will echo back when you're the one having a hard day.

These skills aren't just for this moment, this year, or this decade. They're the kind of human capacities that remain valuable regardless of what technology emerges, what society looks like, or what challenges the future holds.

## Your Next Steps 📝

Starting tomorrow, pick one area from this guide and practice it for a week. Maybe it's pausing before reacting when something frustrates you. Maybe it's looking for the complexity in a situation where you usually see things in black and white. Maybe it's extending kindness to someone who's been getting on your nerves.

Small, consistent practices create lasting change. You don't need to transform overnight – you just need to commit to growing a little bit each day.

Remember: maturity isn't about perfection. It's about progress. It's about becoming someone who can handle life's inevitable challenges with grace, wisdom, and a generous heart. And that's a journey worth taking, one day at a time.

The fabric feels smooth with a bit of stretch, the collar sits sharp all day, and the buttons feel high quality. The small logo and nylon pocket detail add a modern, clean edge without being loud.

1n5dhlo,https://v.redd.it/tzcgjanrwgmf1,Espresso profiling and latte art with La Siene X,"Alright so last time I uploaded I got comments about how short the video was so here’s a longer one! Some background of me I started my coffee journey with the Mara X V2 I’m not a latte art expert but I’ve been trying to learn for the last 3 years! But I’ve not been able to consistently pour with the Mara x either cause it’s pretty hard to consistently get steam pressure to the 1 - 1.2 bar and the cool to touch wand feature even though sounds cool feels like adds lots of condensation and prevents consistent dry steam or lack of skills 🤣. With the Mara X I had a flow control kit installed which did help me profile my espresso. I remember being so excited about trying to profile a slayer shot, took me almost half a bag of beans to dial a good tasting one still not very satisfied. Enter this machine the La Siene X. Although very plasticky it definitely has some dope features! I really enjoy being able to profile espressos, in this video it’s not clear enough but I just setup a profile to slow ramp up to 3 bars first 13 seconds, next 20 seconds to 7 bars and then finish the shot at 3 bars. 20.5 gms in 42 gms out in about 40-45 seconds. I used Colombian beans with tasting notes of I don’t care what it was but that was a tasty as hell shot of espresso, pairs very well with milk based espresso drink. I’m making here a latte! All references made here are compared with the Mara X V2, I was able to get some really dry steam at consistent 1.5 bars of pressure I just pull the lever and wait till it gets to 1.5 bars and then start steaming the milk. The angle to get to steam the milk can be a bit painful cause the portafilter locks a bit towards the wand, as you can see in the video but it definitely works very well and being a beginner I’m able to get better milk texture consistently to pour good looking latte arts! Of course I was sent this machine for free in exchange for videos, but this is my unbiased opinion of the good sides of why I like this machine comparing to my Mara X v2. There are definitely some things I don’t enjoy as well like the group head doesn’t really heat up the portafilter, have to do a few flushes to warm it up. But at the same time trying to flush, the water splashes all over, hopefully they improve the grill design. There is no way to know whether the water tank is empty, with so many features like the milk temperature sensor, built in scales, I never thought it didn’t have something to tell ya you’re out of water. But at the same time, these are definitely knit picking the issues of the machine, I really enjoy playing around with the profiling! Hope you enjoy the POV video!",2,1756695355.0,espresso,5,0.56,False

""When a girl lets her hair down from the hat or ponytail or updo that has been present since the beginning, and it flows down over her shoulders and back without a trace of spray or styling product in it, in perfect soft curls. Nope!""
2. ""A character gets a code or lock combo or lengthy coordinates over the phone and never writes anything down, but remembers the whole sequence 24 hours later when they need it.""
3. ""When people are trying to hide from the bad guys, they keep whispering, or cracking the door open to look out, or moving curtains to peek out the window. I’m like, GET AWAY FROM THE FUCKING WINDOW!""
4. ""Actors holding cups and flailing them all over the place, like dude act like the cup is full or get water or some weights in it so you’re not flipping your to-go cup all over the place.""
5. [""When a character falls down a bottomless shaft or pit and somehow survives. (Star Wars).""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/williambarrios/best-star-wars-quotes)
6. [""One of my most hated movie clichés is about high school movies. With a few exceptions, once you hit 16 and can get a driver's license, you automatically either are given a car by your parents or you have your parents match your savings dollar for dollar so that you can get a semi-atttractive car for like $2,000. Also, with regard to teen movies, the characters with cars almost always are able to find a parking spot 10 feet from the front door and do not get yelled at for that.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marisamartinez/best-high-school-movies)
7. ""Someone surely already mentioned how toothbrushes in movies almost never actually have toothpaste on them. And couples are always fine with making out first thing in the morning with foul-ass morning breath.""
8. ""How about when the characters are in a very old house, the furniture is covered with sheets, there are cobwebs everywhere, and 4 inches of dust. Suddenly, they move an object that causes a giant dust cloud, and not one person sneezes, coughs, or gets asthma, and they casually continue about their business.""
9. ""I’ll never understand how, in most movies or TV shows, people always need just 30 minutes to do anything. Have to run across town? Be back in 30 minutes. Need to get something from the store? 30 minutes. Hell, I live in a small-ish town, and it takes longer than 30 minutes to run most errands due to driving time alone. Maybe that’s a reality in some areas but definitely not down here!""
10. ""Using a gun or having an explosion and hearing and talking fine afterwards. You'd be shouting and your ears would be damaged.""
11. ""The syringe in the neck. Every time I see a movie where a character gets a shot in the neck — ugh! That’s not how it’s done, Joyce! Or when they immediately get knocked out from the injection — if only it really happened that way smh.""
12. ""Knocking someone out by hitting them in the head often to avoid killing them. That person would need a hospital, could be bleeding internally, swelling, and all sorts.""
13. ""Female detectives are always carrying baggage from the past, like they didn’t find a killer fast enough, and they blame themselves for not saving the victim. They work 24x7, ARE always ‘withdrawn’, never smile, sleep, or eat (coffee only), and always have people telling them ‘hey, you need to talk to a therapist’, which they never do.""
14. ""I will never understand the thing where someone knocks or rings the doorbell, and when there is no answer, they take that as a sign to just... let themselves in. Then they call out 'Hello?' several times. Do people really just walk into other people's houses when they don't answer the door? Because where I'm from, that's a big old illegal.""
15. ""When they plan a dinner date and one of them says, 'I'll pick you up at 8.' You know it's going to take at least 20 minutes to get to the restaurant, another 10 to look at the menu and place an order, and 20-30 before the food is served, and that's assuming they're seated right away. So those people are eating dinner after 9 p.m., like that's completely normal when you work a 9-5 job.""
16. Post-apocalyptic related movies. The women are always still magically fully shaven, have clean and flowing hair, wear subtle makeup, and are not freaking out about where the heck they’re gonna find pads or tampons.""
17. ""One of the gay kids’ parents is a homophobe, or they have a horrific coming-out story, self-loathing, etc. Every damn time.""
18. ""Every Trans kid, for one, has to be deadnamed in the story (SO unnecessary). Two, they  have a scene where they're running from their bullies. Yes, as a trans person, many, if not most, of us have traumatic backstories. But hey, what if we imagined a world where that wasn't the case? What if? Let's try it once, just to see how it goes. Can we just be queer and not have the story start with trauma?? Can we be gay or bi or trans and not have bullies chase us? Can we just try to imagine a world where kids can just be loved and accepted? Let's try it.""
19. ""Perfectly organized bedrooms/apartments/homes. Spaces hardly ever look lived in, with things just left out or lying around. Or if the spaces are like that, it looks staged.""
20. ""Women going to bed in full makeup. Women waking up in the morning with full makeup. Women depicted as depressed, drug binges, homeless, on the run from monsters or the law, etc, etc, with full makeup. 🙄""
21. ""The hand-cut one always gets me. If someone needs a little blood, why do they need such a big ass dramatic cut on the palm of their hand?? That is the last spot I'd go for!!""

23. ""Mine is the stupid L-shaped blanket that covers up women's chests and men's waists, and then when they get out of bed, they've got their underwear on.""

26. ""Mine is when people have sex covered up UNDER the blankets... literally NO ONE does that.""
27. ""In horror films, when they hit/stab the killer only once and then run away.  THAT'S NOT GOING TO STOP HIM.""
28. ""Romanticizing hidden pregnancies / secret parentage. A woman sleeps with a guy, clearly raises the child alone for X years, and then THERE'S some magical romantic reveal about their real father / your child I never told you about. So she never needed child support? She didn’t need help? She just wanted him to be able to live his life unburdened by a baby, but now it’s cute to reunite everyone, and we are all going to embrace and be normal about this new life-changing information?""
29. ""Cell phones dying/not having service in horror movies.""

Cue hustle montage where they get all the money in the nick of time. I think that was like every other episode of Shameless.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/marisamartinez/tv-shows-people-started-watching-but-actually-couldnt-finish)
31. ""Another thing that grinds my gears is how movies portray a plane (especially a big one like a passenger plane) losing an engine or getting damaged in even the most minor ways. It either immediately nosedives, instantaneously combusts, shakes overdramatically, or some mixture of the three. Like dude, I know stuff like that can happen if the damage is in the right place, but seriously. Planes can still fly and land relatively okay with damage, even if they’re completely riddled with bullets like a WWII bomber I once heard about.""
32. ""People in modern times who act like it's still the 90s, and smartphones don't exist, meaning finding super incriminating evidence and don't take an immediate screenshot/photo/video to send to everyone before the psycho stalker removes everything and makes them look crazy.""
33. ""In so many movies, a simple misunderstanding turns into this huge thing and drives the plot. Something gets said out of context, and it becomes this huge thing, when in reality a normal person would call or talk to that person and say, 'Hey, did you say this about me?' Then the other person will explain and put it in context, and the conflict is over in 5 minutes, not 90 minutes.""
34. ""When the villain walks slowly, chasing a victim who runs away from him, and is still able to catch the victim.""
35. ""I don't like it when a main character does something unusually cruel to some random person, only for that person to turn out to be a bad guy in the end. How was the main character supposed to know??""
36. ""Mostly in action movies, but in other genres as well, someone falls over a cliff and they are grabbed by someone else (sometimes with only one hand). That's a lot of dead weight to be carrying, and the average person can't hold that much weight. Plus, most of these people don't have the best position to hold all that weight. Double bonus if they also then pull that person up with one hand. And let's not even get started on grip strength. Chances are, even if you can pull the person up, you'll probably lose your grip at some point.""
37. [""Hazmat gear. I've been a hazmat guy, and while I love shows like Breaking Bad, the way they 'wear' the gear should leave them overdosed and dead on the floor. Any safety gear you can yank on or off in a second or two is faulty and useless.""](https://www.buzzfeed.com/trendyghost618/fake-products-in-movies-and-tv-trivia-quiz)

39. ""Fist fights where NO ONE is bruised or has swollen faces AFTER the fight!""
40. ""I hate when people who have broken up or hate each other for some reason go through a crisis of some sort and are instantly best friends or in love afterward, without any sort of relevant work on their relationships. I would really like to see something where enemies have to work together to solve a crisis but at the end still think each other is an asshole and go their separate ways.""
41. ""When they are making a huge pre-planned bust at a warehouse with 12 known bad guys, but only show up with the 2-3 core cast members. No backup.""
42. ""When the cops or FBI see the bad guy a block away and yell at them to freeze or whatever, or all the cops are at the front door with no one at the back door, both make it easy for the bad guy to get away.""
43. ""A cop or detective, one day from retirement,  WHO gets the case of a lifetime that they just have to solve, and they end up discovering a newfound love of policing and don’t retire.

1n5dgub,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1n5dgub/rf_when_fate_framed_us_together/,[RF] When Fate Framed Us Together,"**Before We Met — We Were Meant**  
A story of fate, quiet love, and moments that make you believe in destiny.

**1. Weekend Nostalgia**  
It was a quiet Sunday afternoon.

Dhaval sat on the couch, a warm cup of chai in hand, lazily flipping through his old college trip photos. Anamika, his wife of four years, was in the kitchen humming an old song, unaware of what was about to unfold.

They had an arranged marriage — no long dating phase, no college romance, just two strangers who chose to build a life together. And somehow, they made it work. Long drives, late-night talks, and shared silences had turned them into best friends over the years.

But what Dhaval saw that day would change everything he believed about chance.

**2. The Photo Frame of Fate**  
Click. Click. Swipe.

He paused.

One photo from his Udaipur college trip caught his eye — a random group photo in front of the City Palace. It wasn’t the palace or his college friends that made him freeze.

It was her.

Blurred, in the background, almost hidden behind a group of tourists, stood a girl in a yellow kurta. She wasn’t posing. She was just walking past.

But he knew that face.  
That smile.  
That walk.

It was Anamika.  
His wife.

**3. Destiny in a Snapshot**  
He stared at the photo in disbelief.

How was this possible?  
They had never met before marriage. Or so he thought.

And yet, here she was, captured in a photo from seven years ago, when they were both college students, unknown to each other.

He rushed to the kitchen.

“Anamika! Come here, you need to see this.”

She wiped her hands and walked over.  
He pointed to the photo.

“Look closely. Isn’t that… you?”

She squinted.

Her eyes widened. A small gasp escaped her lips.  
“Yes… that’s me! Oh my God, that is me. I had gone to Udaipur with my friends around that time.”

Silence.

They both looked at each other.  
Smiled.  
And then burst into laughter — the kind that comes from pure joy and quiet wonder.

**4. When Something Is Meant to Be**  
They sat together for hours that day, looking through more photos, sipping tea, and talking about the strange, beautiful coincidence that had always lived in their past — quietly waiting to be discovered.

That photo became more than just a frozen moment.  
It became a reminder.

A reminder that when something is meant for you, it will find its way to you —  
in a city you don’t remember,  
in a frame you didn’t notice,  
in a person you were yet to fall in love with.

Sometimes, destiny doesn’t knock on your door loudly.  
It whispers, hides in pixels, and waits — patiently — for the day you’ll finally see it.

**5. Udaipur — Again, but Together**  
A week later, they were walking hand in hand near the same City Palace, this time as husband and wife.

It wasn’t a lavish trip — just two people reliving a strange twist of fate. They took selfies near the spot where the original photo had been clicked. Laughed again. Talked for hours over lakeside coffee. Shared new memories in a place that had unknowingly started their story years ago.

They even recreated that blurry photo — this time, intentionally — smiling directly into the lens.

That night, over dinner, Dhaval said, “It’s like the universe left us a trail — and we finally followed it.”

Anamika nodded, eyes glowing. “We were always meant to find each other. This… was just proof.”

They ended the night planning a weekend movie and dinner date, soaking in the serendipity that life had gifted them — again.

**Final Thought**  
Go with the flow.  
Trust the timing of your life.

Because when something is truly meant for you — it won’t pass you by.  
It will find you. In its own time. In its own quiet, magical way.",1,1756695288.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite

I’m looking to make some new online friends, adults only (18+), because I more interested in sharing experiences with people around my age.

A bit about me: I live with five cats who clearly think they pay the rent. 😂 However, I adore all animals and believe each one is beautiful in its own chaotic way. I’d love to have a dog someday, but right now, cats suit my lifestyle way better.

I play football (soccer) almost every evening, it’s my daily dose of cardio. I’m big into fitness too, and working out is basically my cheap therapy. I also love cooking, especially healthy stuff that tricks my brain into thinking I'm a responsible adult. If you’re into fitness, we might just be accountability buddies and can hype each other up 💪

I’ve recently fallen down the skincare rabbit hole. At this point, my face has become an experiment ground but glow goals xD 😌

I’m a huge history nerd. Give me ancient legends, epic battles, or ghost stories and I’m hooked. Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones are my comfort shows. I game too Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favourite 

I’m a full-time software engineer. But no matter how busy life gets, I always make time for a good conversation. So if anything here sounds remotely relatable or just mildly interesting drop a message. ☺️I don’t bite (but one of my cats might). 😺 ",1,1756695231.0,friendship,1,1.0,False

I wanna preface this by saying I don't want to turn this into a flipping business! I'm not looking to be an instagram flipper person/business. If anything, I would still do this for free.

The city I'm living in has SO so much stuff put out on sidewalks for people to take. More often than not, it’s completely useable (not smashed/destroyed).  
I'm a super crafty, DIY person so I love being able to upcycle and restore literally anything. I've literally furnished a majority of my apartment with things i've thrifted and found on the sidewalk. For example, some of the things I've found for free: an espresso machine, 10+ lamps, multiple dining chairs, plant pots galore, rugs, dressers, a fan, mirrors, dvd player, a bunch of vinyls, a sick coffee table, car roof boxes, dishes, endless bits and bobs, etc. A majority of it was in good condition but I've cleaned, restored and repaired many things.  
Like the espresso machine, fan and dvd player were very basic repairs that almost anyone could do.

I want to keep doing this but I officially have no more space and can't store things.   
But I wan't to keep upcycling to keep things out of landfill. Like today I saw about 3-4 large furniture pieces that I would have taken to fix up. They were all nice quality, though could definitely use some tlc. All I want to do is give things a second life, clean them up and let someone else enjoy it.  
I also really love the idea of salvaging as much as possible. For example, the wood from broken furniture, hardware, hinges, knobs, glass, table legs, leather from torn couches etc. That kind of stuff.

1n5dbmm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n5dbmm,Liquid Magnolia,"Here's another of my favorite drinks for a NA evening.  This one features a couple unusual ingredients:

  
\* Magnolia petal tea.  I make this from the spent flowers of the Magnolia grandiflora trees around my neighborhood. After the blooms are are spent, they drop a fragrant and rather interesting tasting petal.  I collect a bunched handful,.wash them well, and then boil in about 2 liters of water. (See second picture). I then strain through a paper coffee filter and chill.  The aroma is intensely floral, just like the flower, but with a more dusty or woody note.  The flavor, by itself, is kind of bitter with a vegetal quality to it.  But with a little sweetness, this turns into a lovely ""briskness"".  It very much reminds me of the bite of a strongly brewed iced sweet tea, but the bite is a little less sharp and more rounded.

\* Plum cheong.  It is a Korean syrup made with plums that are slowly broken down in sugar.  The flavor is exactly like Asian plum wine, which shouldn't be a surprise because these wines are sweetened with this.  I find cheongs in general to be a great upgrade to fruit syrups you'd use for things like Italian sodas.  They almost taste fruitier than the fruit they are made from! 

\* I finished with soda water and some diced frozen bits of plum in the place of ice cubes 

  
With the right ratio of magnolia, cheong, and soda, the drink winds up kind of tasting like a bubbly iced tea.  Except none of the flavors are quite the same.  Both the aromatics from the magnolia and the complex fruit notes of the cheong give plenty to entertain your taste buds, and the brisk finish of the magnolia encourage you to sip and let the experience sit in your mouth for a bit.  

The ratios are probably around this:



\* 3 parts soda

  
\* 1 part cheong

  
\* 2 parts chilled magnolia tea.  You may need more or less depending on how strong you brewed it.

I have been married to my wife for over 10 years and have 2 kids 9M and 7F. My wife physically and verbs abused me when we were visiting relative house.

She got mad for that ( literally this one), I asked her politely that we are other relative house and this is not a big deal. She could warm her coffee. Any ways, long story short, she got mad, physically abused me in front of the kids. When I went in the room to get my car keys and wallet, she followed and wanted to take the car key away. She againt physically punched me in the face, i tried to get her away but she took off my glasses and wallet and blocked the door and demanded to give me the car keys as well. I asked her to give me back my glasses so i could leave. Any ways it took her 45 minutes before she gave me back my glasses and wallet, so I could leave the room.

1n5d9x8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1n5d9x8/my_girlfriend_and_i_get_tortured_for_a_living/,My girlfriend and I get tortured for a living. Something went seriously wrong during her last session and now she's different,"I've always had a bit of a passion for odd jobs. 

When I was a teenager, I discovered Craigslist, and everything just kind of snowballed from there. You wouldn't believe the kinds of things you can find on the internet - the kind of jobs you can secure without having to do any paperwork. Most of the time the people hiring either don't want to be traceable by the government, or they're just far too desperate at that point to add any additional hoops to jump through. 

That was how I met Chelsea. It was actually a really funny story, perfect for telling at parties. It would be perfect for our wedding, too, and for telling our kids. It would have been, at least. 

We met because we had both been hired to come to this birthday party, a kid turning eleven. Neither of us fully knew what the job entailed when we agreed, which might have been a sign that we shouldn't have, but we were both informed we'd be paid handsomely, and that was all that either of us needed to hear. 

When we got there Frank, a middle aged guy with a salt-and-pepper beard who smelled strongly of patchouli and marinara sauce, informed us we were to get in a huge screaming match around the middle of the party. We were playing a couple from a few houses down who were really on the fritz, I guess. We weren't told why, just what to do. I'm still not sure why he wanted us to do that. 

I was hesitant. I wasn't much of an actor. But Chelsea, she threw herself into the role wholeheartedly. A couple of hours later we were sitting on the curb a block away, and she was holding a bag of frozen carrots against my swollen cheekbone, and I was nursing a blunt, wincing at how my chocolate milk soaked clothing stuck to my skin. 

We compared stories of our strangest jobs, our craziest experiences, the worst things we'd ever done to make a couple bucks. We both agreed that anything below a felony was fair game, but we gravitated towards weird yet legal and harmless tasks. She had a passion for all of it that I'd never seen in anyone I'd ever met. She was really doing it for the experiences, not the money. She was a thrill seeker. 

I fell in love with her quickly, like getting hit over the head with a blunt object. It was aggressive and immediate. 

A couple of months later we got a place together, and the rest was history. We fell into a nice, domestic routine: she made me coffee in the morning and kissed my forehead when I walked into the kitchen, we took turns cooking dinner and doing the dishes and we watched hours of reality television slop on our sofa that was just big enough for two. We talked about the future. We talked about a dog and two kids and a yard. It all just fell into place. 

Her friends liked me, and my friends liked her, and our families were the same. My mother became a little too obsessed with having a grandchild, and I had to beg her to stop asking Chelsea about her cycle. But none of them knew about our secret life, the jobs we did together when everyone went home. It was just for us, and it was exciting, this secret hobby that we shared. 

The first call from OEM came on a quiet Friday. Chelsea was at her job as a barista, and I was at home getting some cleaning done before having lunch with my parents, like an old person. 

I was used to getting calls that didn't have identification, considering all my side jobs, so I didn't bat an eye at the NO CALLER ID on my screen. What was different, however, was the automated message that played as soon as I picked up the call. 

""*This call may be recorded for quality assurance and training purposes. Please state your first and last name, and your date of birth.*"" 

I frowned, tossing the rag I'd been cleaning the stove with onto the kitchen counter. 

""Julian Raines, May 14th, 1999."" 

There was a silence, and then a beep. Then a man spoke, non-automated this time. 

""*Hello, Mr. Raines. I've been informed you might be looking for a job?*"" 

When Chelsea got home, I was waiting for her on the couch. She came up behind me, cupped my face in her hands, and kissed the top of my head. 

""Hey, babe,"" I said, trying to keep the excitement out of my voice. ""How was work?"" 

""Exhausting."" She slumped over the back of the couch, smushing the cushions. ""But I got this crazy voicemail..."" 

The facility was in what looked, from the outside, like a dilapidated warehouse. The man who picked us up in a long black car was very quiet, answering our questions in single word responses and keeping his eyes on the road. Chelsea and I kept giving each other small glances and squeezing each other's hands the entire way there. 

A man greeted us at the car door, opening it for us with a smile. He was tall and thin, and he wore a crisp suit with his dark hair slicked back, not a strand askew. 

""Mr. and Mrs. Raines, I presume?"" 

Chelsea looked down shyly. I was surprised, she was never shy - but this situation definitely felt more professional than what we were used to. 

""We aren't married..."" 

""Oh! Oh, I'm sorry."" The man tapped his forehead with the palm of his hand good-naturedly. ""I'm so sorry, miss...?""

""Sutherland."" 

""Miss Sutherland, of course."" He reached out to shake her hand, and then mine, eager. ""My name is Malcolm Kessler. You can just call me Kessler. Would you like to know what you're doing here?"" 

We let Kessler lead us into the building. On the inside, it looked far less run down... we were greeted with long white hallways and bustling professionals holding coffees and clipboards, wearing matching white lab coats. 

""Is this like... a hospital?"" Chelsea asked, gazing around in awe. I took her hand again, and she gave it a squeeze. 

""No, not a hospital... although there are medical professionals here, and we do certainly have access to those kinds of tools."" He offered us a sly grin. 

We entered a room with a metal table and four chairs, and not much else. A woman with her hair tied up in a tight bun came in, placed a stack of papers on the table, and scurried away. Kessler gestured for us to take a seat. 

""This,"" he said slowly, looking from me, to Chelsea, and back again. ""This is OEM. Do you know what that stands for?"" He waited for us to shake our heads before continuing. ""This is the Office of Enhanced Methods."" 

I blinked at him, the white fluorescent lights making my eyes burn. ""What does that mean?"" 

""I'm glad you ask."" Kessler leaned back in his seat, folding his hands in his lap. ""Essentially, here at OEM, we test torture methods. See what works, see what doesn't, see what we need to change or scale back on. You know."" 

I could feel Chelsea looking at me. I looked back. I couldn't quite read her expression, but somehow I still could get the gist. 

""Is this... um... a government project?"" She asked, her eyes still locked on mine and her brows furrowing. 

Kessler chuckled. ""You could say that.""

""So why do you need us?"" I asked, even though I felt I might know the answer, finally looking away from my girlfriend and back at the man in front of us. 

Kessler sighed, leaning forward again, resting his elbows on the table. He had quite a sharp face, but it managed to feel charming and welcoming purely from his expression. I wondered if he'd practiced that. ""I'll level with you,"" he said, quieter than before. ""We need volunteers. But finding volunteers for something like this is... difficult. That's why now we're looking for people like you, people who are interested in doing odd jobs like this one, and we're offering a large amount of compensation."" 

I pressed my lips together, searching his face for any sign of deception or exaggeration. I found none. I glanced back at Chelsea, who was looking at the stack of paperwork. 

""How much compensation?"" I asked finally, when it became clear that no one else was going to say it. I expected Kessler to laugh. He didn't. 

""Are you two looking to get married?"" 

I felt the room heat up. Truthfully, I had bought the ring a month ago. I was just waiting for the right time, and a time when we could properly plan for a wedding without the stress of becoming bankrupt for it. 

""Yes, I mean, eventually..."" 

""Have you seen how much those venues cost these days?"" Kessler raised his eyebrows sympathetically, leaning even closer to us. ""Not to mention a honeymoon... are you looking to have kids, start a family? Send those kids to college? Grow old and retire?"" 

The man actually reached out, actually took my hand in one of his and Chelsea's in his other. I felt like the air in the room was being sucked out of it. 

""I'm going to be honest with you two, I am not going to mince words. It's tough out there right now. I could make it so you never have to worry about money again."" 

He left us in the room to let us talk alone, and I could have sworn I heard the lock click behind him, but to be fair I was feeling pretty jumpy by that point. Chelsea and I sat for a moment in silence. 

""This is a lot,"" she muttered, running her fingers through her hair. ""This place is crazy."" 

I reached over to flip through the paperwork, chewing on my bottom lip. I saw words like non-disclosure agreement, liability, medical care... I put the paperwork back down and took her hand again. 

""It's a lot of money. He seemed serious.""

""Would we be considered... like... war criminals? If we took part in this?"" She laughed, but I could tell she was anxious. 

I shrugged slowly. She rubbed at her face with her free hand, a nervous habit of hers. I reached over and tucked some hair behind her ear, smiling. She smiled back apprehensively. 

There was something neither of us were saying, something neither of us wanted to point out. *How bad was the job to offer that amount of compensation?* 

Still, there was a buzz between us. This was what we did, we signed up for strange things for the experiences... Chelsea lived for things like this. I think I knew the second we got there that she would end up wanting to do it. 

When Kessler came back, I stood up, pushing my chair back and wiping my sweaty hands on my jeans. 

""What kind of torture are we talking about?"" 

His smile was wide. ""I can show you now, if you'd like."" 

He explained as he lead us back down the hall, guiding us into a different room that was essentially the exact same as the one we had just been in, but with more cameras mounted on the walls and with different chairs... I winced a little when I saw the wrist and ankle restraints attached to the sterile metal frame.

""Everything we do here stays within these walls,"" he told us, gesturing for us to take a seat. Chelsea and I shared a look, then obeyed. ""Communication wise, but also physically. We will do nothing to permanently damage you, and we have medical staff on sight for any treatment you may need."" 

As if on cue, a man in one of the lab coats bustled into the room, pushing a cart. He began strapping down our wrists, leaving our legs unrestrained. 

""Everything is voluntary,"" Kessler continued. ""Nothing will happen to you without your explicit consent, although we may need to withhold some details in order to get the most accurate read on your reactions. You can leave or discontinue your contracts at any time."" 

The man in the lab coat started putting on medical gloves. I swallowed hard. 

""What is he going to do?"" 

Kessler nodded at the man, who procured a syringe from his cart, examining the needle carefully and then picking up a little glass bottle to draw from. 

""This is just... let's call it a sample. This is something we've been working on for a while, it's already been tested many times with a high success rate."" 

I wondered what a high success rate in this context was. A large sum of pain? The right amount of screaming? 

""Usually, we'd probably hook you up to various brain wave sensors, but we'll start light today."" 

The doctor (was he a doctor?) approached Chelsea, who squirmed anxiously. He wiped her arm with an alcohol swab, and began feeling around for a good vein. I watched her, trying to look encouraging when her eyes met mine. 

""This is a sort of... *liquid electrocution*. Per say."" 

Before either of us could reply to that, the doctor was inserting the needle into Chelsea's arm and pushing down on the plunger. 

I watched her body seize up, her eyes going wide and glassy. She was perfectly still for a moment, save for her mouth falling open and her entire face going slack... and then she began to twitch and spasm, her limbs jerking with no control. Then she screamed, a gurgling, horrifying sound, and I was struck with panic. 

I was so distracted I barely felt the needle sliding into my own arm. 

And then it felt like I was being set on fire. 

We didn't go back to that place for a couple of months. Kessler told us to take our time, to think about it, as he handed us a tall stack of dollar bills. The feeling of the money almost bulging out of my pocket almost made up for the pain. 

He had told the truth: it didn't last. It felt like the effects of the injection lasted an hour, but we were told it had only been a few minutes before it wore off. I expected to be weak leaving the facility, and prepared myself to be embarrassed to handle it worse than my girlfriend did, but the feeling faded fast. In fact, I almost felt more alive. 

We were given a brief interview where a younger man scribbled extensive notes, and then we were free to go. 

The first thing Chelsea said to me when we got outside was, ""What a rush!"" 

Still, we waited a while. It felt like a next step in our odd jobs hobby to make this a regular thing, like something a little bit depraved. It was dystopian, it was strange and scary. Even though the sensation was gone, I could vividly remember what the injection had done to me, how it had torn through my veins, how I had wondered if I was dying... and that was supposed to just be a *sample*. 

But eventually, neither of us could stay away. The money was good... beyond good. 

At first, we kept it a secret from each other, as if we were doing something bad. She would head off to work, and I would drive to the warehouse. They would inject me, feed me things that made me sick, toss me around, even beat me, and then I would drive home, still reeling and sore. Chelsea started acting strange, staying up after I went to bed, but I couldn't exactly call her out on it, because I was being strange too. 

Neither of us wanted to put any pressure on the other, I guess. And I don't think either of us liked the idea of the other getting tortured. 

It was all but confirmed in my mind that we were both doing the same thing when I caught her coming through the front door at almost three AM, rubbing at her temple like she had a horrible migraine. I was sitting on the couch, reading a book, waiting for her. 

She stopped cold, her eyes going wide. I couldn't help but chuckle. 

""Cheating on me?"" I asked. She laughed, plopping down next to me on the couch. 

""Not exactly."" 

I pulled her to me, and she rested her head on my shoulder. 

""Let's just do it together, okay? From now on, let's just go together."" 

I waited for an answer, but after a minute, all I got was a snore. 

We went together the next weekend. Kessler greeted us, patting each of us on our backs cheerfully. 

""Great to see you two together again! The work you both have been doing here is just fantastic."" 

Chelsea and I eyed each other, and she gave me a little punch on the arm. I grinned at her. 

""I have something different for you two today, now that you're here together, if you're up for it."" 

My smile faded a little, twisting into mild concern. I licked my lips. ""Different how?"" 

He waved me off, guiding us into one of the rooms. The same chairs greeted us, with their cuffs and restraints. A doctor was already inside, toying with some kind of strap. It looked sort of like a headband. 

""We'd like to try something more... psychological... than you're used to."" 

I stopped in my tracks. Kessler and Chelsea both turned to face me, their eyebrows raising in sync. 

""Psychological torture?"" I was getting vivid images in my head, all of the psychological horror movies I'd ever seen rushing back to me. Physical pain was one thing, but sanity was delicate, something that shouldn't be played with. 

Kessler approached me, placing his hands on each of my shoulders, and offered me a reassuring smile. 

""Think about it, Mr. Raines,"" he said, his voice kind. ""It will be a brief test, it'll only last around thirty seconds. Like I've said, nothing will leave this facility, and we have professionals to assess your mental state directly afterwards. Thirty seconds for enough money to buy a used car."" 

I worried my lips together, the fear I'd had in the past creeping back in... if it wasn't dangerous, why was it worth so much? Worth more than we'd been paid for anything before? 

""Come on, Jules."" Chelsea smiled at me from behind him. She didn't look afraid, and it soothed me a little. ""We'll do it together."" 

I nodded reluctantly. Almost as soon as my chin raised to do so, the doctor was slipping the headband on, two metal plates digging into my forehead. I felt my muscles tense up. 

We took our seats, and Chelsea reached over to grab my hand. They didn't strap us down this time, which I hardly thought about until after it was too late. 

The doctor put Chelsea's headband on too, and she made a face at me, which made me bite back a laugh. 

""Ready?"" Kessler asked. Then he nodded at the doctor, who pressed something on what looked like a keyboard, and Julie started to scream. 

The second he touched the thing, she was screaming. 

It wasn't like any scream I had ever heard before, not like the one from the first time we'd been here and not in any horror movie. Certainly never in real life. It felt like my eardrums were bursting, and it only grew louder and more shrill. 

It was desperate. It was beyond torture, beyond pain, beyond anything a human could possibly endure. I imagined hell, I imagined that souls being dragged to damnation, might sound something like that scream. I wasn't even religious. 

She squeezed my hand and I felt my bones cracking. 

""Chelsea! Chelsea?"" 

I rocketed out of my seat, trying to shake her, trying to ignore the searing pain. She wouldn't let go of my hand, couldn't. Her eyes were wide open and dead, looking right at me but not seeing anything. Still, tears streamed from them, more tears than I'd ever seen anyone cry. 

I whipped back around. The doctor was typing urgently at his computer, and Kessler was staring, his hands out and his eyes moving rapidly back and forth like he was in shock. 

""Jesus Christ, do something!"" I screamed. ""Fucking do something!"" 

Chelsea was gasping now, a ragged sound that bounced around in my head. It felt like I could hear nothing but that horrible wet gasp, just dead air and her throat clawing for breath, drool seeping from her mouth and down her chin. 

Finally, I ripped the headband off her. Instantly she went slack, letting go of my hand. 

The room was silent for a moment. Then Kessler muttered something to the other man, and the doctor rushed out the door. 

""Chelsea? Chelsea, baby are you okay?"" I kneeled in front of her, rubbing her knee. She wouldn't look at me, wouldn't move. For a second, I wondered if she was dead. ""Please answer me..."" 

Right when I was about to check her pulse, her head turned. She wasn't screaming anymore, but her eyes were just as dead as they had been before when they met mine. They didn't even look like her eyes anymore. 

She opened her mouth, and out of it came a horrible whispery sound, like she'd forgotten how to use her tongue. I leaned in closer, trying to smile at her weakly. 

""What is it, honey?"" 

""Please,"" she gasped. ""No more."" 

I felt hot, I felt like I had a horrible fever. I reached up, touched her wet face. ""It's over, baby. No more. It's over."" 

She stared at me, if you could call it that. She wasn't in her body anymore. This was something else. She twitched. 

""Just kill me..."" 

I turned back to look at Kessler. He looked just as shocked as I did, anxiously adjusting his tie. For a long moment we met eyes, and I knew what he was thinking. Something had gone horribly, unbelievably wrong here. 

And he didn't know how to fix it. 

The next few hours were a horrible blur. I remember doctors rushing around, wheeling Chelsea out of the room despite my pleas to know where they were going, to let me go with them. I sat alone in the cold, sterile room, her scream echoing around in my head. I cried, I begged the cameras in the corners of the room, I banged my head against the table. Someone came in and bandaged up my broken hand, but no one would tell me anything. 

It felt like days that I was in there. Honestly, it could have been. When the door finally opened again and Kessler stepped through it, I couldn't even feel relieved... I just felt broken. 

""Where is she?"" I croaked, raising my head. ""Is she okay?"" 

He said nothing, just sat down in front of me. He was back to business, the horrified expression I'd last seen him have completely wiped away, although I could have sworn his face was a little pale. 

He took an envelope out of his pocket and placed it on the metal table between us. 

""Miss Sutherland is right outside. She's unharmed, and feeling fine."" 

I choked out a sob: I couldn't help it. I hid my face in my hands. Kessler cleared his throat and continued. 

""You are to take this envelope. Inside is a check for seven hundred thousand dollars. One of our drivers is going to take you to the emergency room, where you will have your hand properly treated. Any further medical bills will be completely covered by us. You are to do this, and then go home and never return here. Do you understand?"" 

I looked up at him, and I nodded. I was angry: I wanted to yell, demand answers, threaten to sue... but I was far too exhausted for any of that. I just wanted to see Chelsea, I just wanted to go home. Kessler nodded, his mouth pressed into a thin line. 

""We at OEM are terribly ashamed about what took place today. Please accept our deepest condolences.""

Something about that rubbed me the wrong way, made my skin prickle, but my mind was numb. I just nodded again, taking the envelope and shoving it into my pocket. 

Chelsea was just outside like he'd said, and she smiled when she saw me. I gathered her in my arms and squeezed, breathing in the scent of her hair, kissing the side of her neck. 

""Thank god you're okay."" 

""Hey, hey, don't cry..."" She pulled back, kissing my cheek and wiping away my tears. ""I'm more than okay, baby. What a rush!"" 

A laugh burst out of me like an uncontrollable cough.

""You're a psychopath.""

""You like it."" 

As promised, we were taken to the hospital, where I was put in a cast. My hand was broken in three different places. As Chelsea sat with me while they examined it, a horrible, anxious feeling crept over me. When I looked at her, all she did was smile. 

I couldn't sleep that night. I stared at the ceiling, white spots drifting across my vision, my hand throbbing dully on my chest. Chelsea's back pressed against the side of my arm was the only thing that made me feel any calmer. I turned to look at the back of her head, chewing on my lip. 

The room felt too quiet, too dark after spending so long in that bright sterile room. I was restless. 

""Chelsea?"" I whispered. ""Are you awake?"" 

She said nothing. She wasn't snoring, but I swore I could hear her heart beating. *Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I sighed. ""What did you feel? When it was happening?"" 

I knew she wouldn't respond, but I asked anyways. I needed to talk, even if it was just to myself. 

*Ka-thunk. Ka-thunk*. 

I felt her shift a little, her back moving with each of her breaths. Her heartbeat began to speed up. Only then did I begin to wonder why I could hear it at all, and so loud. 

I sat up a little, leaning on my elbows. I stroked her hair. 

""Hey, baby... are you okay?"" 

No answer. *Ka-thunk ka-thunk ka-thunk...*

Suddenly I had that feeling. I had that feeling children get at night, when they become positive there's someone in the closet or just outside their bedroom door, someone they don't know. Panic raced through me, and whether it was rational or not, I had to see her face. I had to be sure she was alive, and she was herself, and she was real. 

I reached over and took her arm, rolling her towards me. 

Chelsea's eyes were wide open, bloodshot, and my heart jumped into my throat when I realized it hadn't been her heartbeat that I had been hearing. It had been her gasping for air, her throat closing and opening again rapidly, swallowing and heaving dryly in the dark like an animal about to throw up. *Ka-thunk-ka-thunk-ka-thunk*... 

I shook her awake, sitting straight up in the bed. She gasped, blinking at me almost sleepily, rubbing at her eyes. 

""Julian...?"" Her voice was raspy, tired and dry, but otherwise normal. I flicked on the bedside lamp, breathing hard. ""Babe, what's wrong?"" 

I shook my head. I couldn't look at her, couldn't breathe. I felt her wrap her arms around me, shushing me gently and stroking my hair. 

""You... you were..."" 

""Shh, it's okay. It's okay now, Jules, I'm okay. Just a bad dream..."" 

But it wasn't a dream. I knew it wasn't. 

After that my girlfriend was different. She wasn't herself. 

I tried to go back to normal... she certainly tried to. She went to work like before, saw her friends, watched television with me on our couch. But it didn't feel like she was really there anymore. She didn't sleep much at all, and when she did, it was strange and restless. I more than once caught her sleeping with her eyes wide open, just like that first night. 

Once I asked her what her dreams had been like recently and she hesitated, before telling me: 

""You know how when meat is fresh, and the muscles are still alive, so they move and squirm even though the animal is dead?"" She smiled and ruffled my hair. ""That's what the backs of my eyelids look like."" 

The worst part was how normal she pretended to be. How fine she told me she felt, how she kissed me like always and how she tried to joke, but it never came out quite right. 

I reached my limit one night a month later when I got home after having a drink with some friends. 

The house was completely dark, completely silent, completely still. The second I opened the door, I felt it. The unexplainable terror. Like there was a man in the closet. 

It didn't feel right in there. Nothing felt like it was in the right place, even though I knew it must have been. Everything just felt wrong. 

""Chelsea?"" I called out quietly, shrugging off my jacket, wet from the rain. ""Are you awake, honey?"" 

No answer. I went to go upstairs when I saw her. 

She was down our hallway. Her head was half poking out around the corner, only her eyes showing in the darkness, wide open. Staring at me, but not seeing me. 

She started to scream, and it was even worse to not be able to see her mouth. She screamed in short bursts, like a panting dog, the bloodcurdling sounds jolting out of her. 

Fight or flight kicked in. I turned around and walked right back out the door, closing it behind me. I walked until I was across the street before looking back at the house. 

She was in our bedroom window, the lights turned on, illuminating her silhouette. I watched her rear back and slam her head into the glass once, then again, then again, something dark and liquid trickling down to the frame. 

The paramedics had to tie her down to keep her from thrashing, or from hurting herself. 

I watched as they took her away, begging them to kill her. 

I tried to call OEM, but all I got was a message that the number had been disconnected. I drove back there while she was still in the hospital, but there was nothing left but an empty warehouse. 

When I picked her up, she was completely normal again, the only proof of the episode being the stitches on her forehead. 

It was that day, the day I picked her up, when I felt completely broken down and helpless, that I started to hear her voice. 

""*Honey...?*"" 

I looked over at my girlfriend, or what my girlfriend had become. She was staring out the window, smiling peacefully. 

""What was that?""

She glanced at me, her smile widening. ""Nothing, Julian. I didn't say anything."" 

I turned back to the road, convinced I was just losing my mind. I had to be. It would make sense. 

But then I heard it again. 

""*Julian, open your eyes, honey, it's okay... Jesus Christ, Kessler, would you take that thing off him? I think he's had enough!*"" ",85,1756694685.0,nosleep,2,0.99,False

So I guess I'm pretty picky sometimes.  I've gotten better at finding things to eat, but sometimes it's hard, for different reasons I won't get into.

Right now, I need more protein,  earlier in the day. I don't usually have breakfast except for milky coffee cause I'm nauseous if I eat to early, and I often forget to eat lunch. Then I'm cranky (surprised Pikachu face)! 

I finally decided to try smoothies because drinking is easier than eating, especially when I'm nauseous.  However, I don't like nut butter or bananas which seem to be the main ingredient in smoothies. I'm medium about yogurt, but willing to try. 

But I also have no idea how much of anything to put in. Online recipes are hard because almost all of them call for nut butter or bananas, which I'm not a fan of. I'm also nervous about protein powder because I am not a huge fan of chocolate and fake vanilla can be nauseating. 

Any suggestions for smoothie recipes? I plan to use frozen fruit, milk or yogurt, or OJ if those are gross the first time and maybe some honey. Also thinking of freezing the yogurt and then throwing it in, for like a smoother feel.

May I start off by saying, if you are subscribed to this subreddit, then [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zvubggYPxSgtjFaPIRLVthTRMs6Szt-Ce8JZJHRuO-4/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) is not for you... at least not directly. However, there may be someone in your life who could benefit from learning the utmost basics of fantasy football. You see, I started a work fantasy football league this year, and the the demographic of people I work with does not skew as the typical ""football fan"". I work with a bunch or nerdy people and the gender skews toward the majority being women. I decided to create this nifty slideshow to explain the basic rules and structure of Fantasy Football, to people who know nothing about fantasy football, or maybe even nothing about the game of football, in general.

**This slideshow is for that person/people in your life who are pure and naïve, the unsuspicious and unassuming. Those who don't know what kind of dastardly trap they have fallen into until it's far too late. Plant the seeds, my dear brethren. Recruit your spouse/partner/sibling/parent/grandparent/friend/friend of a friend/coworker/neighbor/neighbor's neighbor/coffee barista/barber/mailman/that one person you haven't seen from high school 12 years ago until today/the person you do that awkward shuffle with on the street, or in a public hallway, as you both walk at each other, but you both try to avoid each other, but you both picked the same direction, so you both then correct the other way, and this keeps happening until you both just stop moving and say to each other ""after you"" with a gesture, and finally one person stays put and the other person goes, and then you never see that person again in your life...**

**Bring them into this cult of stat obsessions and incorrect decisions. Slowly watch them evolve from a person who has never heard the term ""PPR"" in their entire life, into someone who obsessively does mock drafts at 2am, three weeks before their league actually drafts. We need MORE among our ranks. The Fantasy Football Gods demand we SPREAD, INFECT, and CONSUME.**

But also, it's like really fun to teach someone you care about a passion of yours, and to connect with them through it. I hope [this slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zvubggYPxSgtjFaPIRLVthTRMs6Szt-Ce8JZJHRuO-4/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) finds you, and whoever you show it to, well. ❤",17,1756694192.0,fantasyfootball,4,0.9,False

1n5d1xg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1n5d1xg/what_is_at_the_core_of_fear_of_wasting/,What is at the core of fear of wasting?,"When I was a kid I drew a kid-drawing of our house and trees and the sun and whatever on a piece of paper. I don't remember if I showed it to my parents or not but I was quite delighted with it, so I glued it to the headboard of my bed. It was clean, coated wood, and later on (the next day maybe, or later, I don't know) I decided to take it off, and the glue and paper had ruined the wood, and I tried so hard to clean it and remove the meshed-in paper and glue and it just wouldn't come off, and I cried so much that night because I felt I had ruined something beautiful (the bed); that I wasted something. 

This is my earliest memory of this feeling. I was no older than 7 or 8. Today I caught myself tearing up when I thought about the food we waste and throw away. This is recurrent in my life. I cry everytime it hits me deep that I have wasted something of my own like time and opportunities, and things of others as well. I have no idea where to place this in my psychology, and why it hurt me so much as a child to do something so childish and inconsequential.

I don't want to just throw this on my parents as well. I'm sure my dad never cared about such things, but perhaps mom always had special items in the house we had to practice the utmost care with, and this is somehow related. As I am writing this, another emotion behind this lament of wasting something, is feeling like a burden. As long as I can remember, I viewed myself as: I must always add something, not detract. Always give, not take.

The opposite of this is that as a teenager, I liked to destroy stuff. Like once I took out an old tv to the garage and beat it to pieces with a bat. It was not a reaction, it wasn't emotional, I calmly did all of that after the decision came to my mind. Another time whule having an important fight with my dad, I slapped the coffee table with my palm once with intention to break it. It was thick glass with wooden legs. It didn't break. I smacked it again harder, and it broke. Later I said I didn't mean to, I was angry and it was a mistake, but my mom said: I saw you, you clearly wanted to break that glass.

Similar events have taken place since then —but much further in between— where I am extremely calm and still while in a flight or flight state (even in fights) and I have a clear intention of ""breaking something"".

My more hidden parts believe I am enough as I am, neigh, my mere presence is a blessing to those around me. This is my superficial shadow and it's egotistical. But in my conscious mind, I really want to go above and beyond to always give more than I take from anyone in my life. This is exhausting, and also, unsustainable, as when someone is kinder and a better friend or potential partner than me, I push them away. It also means I struggle to accept kindness.

Could this all really go back to such moments in my childhood that I was scolded for or warned not to break something? Could it be that simple? And could the drawing thing have stunted my creativity, as I am so averse to drawing as an adult.

These flavors continued until about halfway through when the nuttiness essentially went away and was replaced with a wonderful, very bold black coffee flavor that, for me, made me almost want to smoke faster to keep this flavor in my mouth. No dirty ashtray mouth with this cigar. The ash stayed really white throughout and it burned like one would hope a ~$40 cigar would, all the way to the end, as you can see. 

This was a two hour smoke that I was sad to be done with. It’s crazy, but I think of all the money I’ve wasted on expensive, “meh” Davidoffs when I could have been buying these. I’m a dummy. 🙂

I have been doing extensive research on where to live once I get out of the military, since the G.I Bill combined with Yellow Ribbon programs gives me the rare opportunity to go to college literally wherever I want that I can get accepted into. 

I am a single man w/ no kids and no burning desire to change that (if the right girl comes along, cool, but I'm not going on the dating apps or anything--been there done that), and ultrarunning is my life's joy and purpose. My ultimate dream is to win the Triple Crown one day (Western States, Hardrock, and UTMB in the same year), but even if I never reach that goal, the decades-long pursuit of it excites me and I just want to push my ultrarunning career as far as it can go and want to prioritize my life around it accordingly.

That said, I do have other interests. As a single man still in his 20s, while I may not be drawn to NYC or LA or drink much with my goals, I'd still like some semblance of a dating scene with fellow outdoorsy women, a handful of solid breweries and restaurants, a handful of places to see a decent band every now and then. Nightlife is not a strong priority though. Strong coffee shop culture and good gyms is a plus. Not too many tech bros (SF) or Instagram models (LA) is also a plus. I also love snowboarding (but don't push it too hard to avoid injury), long hikes, backpacking/fastpacking, traveling (SLC airport is so good!), reading and exploring indie bookstores, cooking, watching NBA, and watching movies.

After doing my research, I've narrowed it down to Boulder, Bend, Missoula, and Salt Lake City. If Seattle or Portland were at higher elevation I would strongly consider them, but all the elite runners intentionally live at altitude for a reason. Denver is too far away from the outdoors that people move there for lol. Flagstaff has the elevation and proximity to its outdoors, but seems to lack the variety in trails, particularly steep elevation gain, of other places, as well as snowboarding access. Let me know if I'm wrong about this. Also quite expensive like Boulder. 

SLC is considerably cheaper than Boulder especially on housing, and I'd like to own something one day even if its just an apartment, and SLC is an actual city which appeals to me over Missoula and Bend. Utah snow kills all the others for snowboarding too. 5 national parks in the state to explore is exciting. The winter inversion is concerning but I've read you can just go to higher altitude to train over it. 

I plan to go back to school for education and become a teacher if that matters. Yes I know the pay scales, unions, and political climate are better in blue states, but I could own a home one day in Utah, and SLC is much more liberal than the rest of the state anyways. I'm a Christian (plz don't shoot me, I hate Trump still and vote blue), so the Mormon thing doesn't scare me. 

So am I right about SLC being it for an ultrarunner with big dreams, or am I missing something?",10,1756693753.0,SaltLakeCity,23,0.75,False

The Wild World of Beta Testing With ZERO Experience!,"Okay—can someone explain to me how I JUST found out people online are basically getting PAID TO TEST APPS?   
Like, apps BEFORE they're even published??  
Where have I been?!  

I thought you had to be some kind of code wizard or have a resume the size of a novel.  
Spoiler: apparently, you can get started with *no* experience.  
Not even joking.

Here’s what I’m piecing together about how these so-called ""Beta Tester"" jobs work.  
You sign up, companies send you their apps to test, and you literally just… try them.  
Write up what broke or annoyed you.  
Sometimes I do this for FREE using my real apps, so why am I only now learning you can get paid for it?  

**Getting started is WAY less scary than I imagined:**  
- ~~No fancy tech skills needed (trust me, I’m just as shocked)~~  
- ~~No degree, no interview trauma!!~~  
- Just your phone, some focus, and the ability to answer honest questions  
- Sign up on pages like **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**   

Here’s the usual process:
- Register with your email (easy)  
- Pick the types of apps you actually enjoy using  
- Wait for a notification from **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**  
- Cautiously open the test app and follow the steps  
- Click, tap, (break?) the app  
- Give your feedback (seriously, don’t sugarcoat it, the bugs are what they want)  
- Get PAID through PayPal or other easy peasy methods

And the cash?  
Okay, don’t expect to retire, but some jobs pay a few dollars just to run through a game.  
Multiply that by a few apps as a side gig, and, huh, suddenly your coffee addiction is funded.

A few DOs and DON’Ts...  
- **DO** check your email spam filter so you don’t miss notifications  
- **DO** make your feedback super detailed – like ""this button crashed my phone LOL,"" not just ""it’s good""  
- **DO** sign up at **[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)** (seriously, this site is just always popping up)  
- **DON’T** lie about issues or post the beta app details elsewhere – it’s NDA city  
- **DON’T** expect to get rich, but wow, if you want bragging rights for using apps before your friends… it’s a win

I’m honestly shocked that ANYONE can do this.  
If you’re lazier than a cat, this might actually be your dream side hustle.  
All you need: WiFi and some curious thumbs.

And if you want the receipts, literally just try it yourself—right here:  
**[https://goodnovel.org/testapp](https://goodnovel.org/testapp)**

Has anyone else here had luck with Beta Tester gigs?  
Share your low-key secrets and what the wildest bug you’ve found has been!  
Because, not gonna lie, sign me up for anything where I get paid to complain about my phone apps 😅

One more time, just to burn it into my brain:
