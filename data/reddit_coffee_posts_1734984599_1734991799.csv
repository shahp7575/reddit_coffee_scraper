I'm attempting to help out a friend who's in a bit of a bind. He's unemployed, EI has run out and has no family support. He had roommates, but they were unable to continue the upkeep on the place and have left. He has found some family willing to put him up, but they live about 4 hours out of town and he has no money to rent a truck or move their things.

I suggested opening a line of credit or credit card (they're with RBC) as I don't believe he updated his employment status with them and figured since his credit was good he could apply online. He believes he'd have to go into a branch in person to apply. I'm not really sure as I don't bank with RBC; I know he doesn't have a credit card or line of credit with them already, so I don't know if they would just let him open a line of credit out of the blue. 

I know he still has an EI cheque coming in, but it's been delayed with the Canada Post strikes. This is unlikely to be enough on its own to pay all the upcoming moving expenses on its own. 

I don't really have any money to lend this person. I've been trying to help out with coffee and conversation but I don't know what else to do. As you can imagine, my friend is in a very stressful bind and finding money to help get them out in these current circumstances feels impossible. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",2,1734991110.0,povertyfinancecanada,3,1.0,False

As the first Starbucks store located near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), it is expected to provide a unique experience at the border with North Korea. 

'Starbucks Gimpo Aegibong Ecological Park' is located just 1.4km away from Gaepung-gun, North Korea. This cafe is located near the DMZ, where civilian access is restricted, so customers have to go through a security check before entering, creating a special experience. 

Starbucks explained that they decided to open this store because they highly valued Aegibong's historical significance and tourism potential. This suggests that Starbucks made a strategic decision that took into account the local culture and history, not just the simple sale of coffee. 

The opening ceremony held in December was attended by about 200 media and citizens from around the world, including Korea, the United States, Japan, and the United Kingdom, showing great interest. Despite the sub-zero cold weather, many people waited in line to order coffee before the store opened.

What's bugging me (20m) is that i have lots of girl-friends, and for some of them i had developed feelings, but i still managed to get 0 romantic interest from them, so that got me thinking, what's wrong?

I feel like i get a decent amount of attention from girls, they like to talk with me, they often get quite touchy, i'm generally viewed as a funny light-hearted guy and i get some compliments for my appearence and physique from time to time. You know, things that would generally make you confident about your appeal to the other sex. 

Where it all falls apart is trying to date those girls. It typically goes like this: i get to know a girl, talk to her, get along with her, see if i like her, then when i feel sure that there is some interest from her, i subtly try to make a move, (like suggesting a quick coffee after lessons or things like that) and that's when things go wrong, because the girl would start acting quite ""uncomfortable"".

-Like you know when you're in your car, you find a deer on the road and it just gets blocked while staring at your headlights? i get THAT look.- Like my approach totally caught them offguard and was totally unexpected, all that is followed by either uncomfortable laughter, rushed excuses, or outright rejection. 

At that point i just let the conversation die off naturally and sink in my embarassment like the titanic, obviously.

I must admit i'm not the best at dating, so that's why i'm asking if you have any clue on this. Why girls just really want to be friends but refuse to date me? 

Maybe i should mention that i'm 5'3"", since i know most girls have strong opinions about height. ",2,1734990881.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

Location: Jasper's master bedroom in the mansion where N, Jasper, L, Uzi, J and previously V, live.

Time: 08:00 local time

[Jasper's bedroom](https://preview.redd.it/ojh3lwkqsn8e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5a627f185355891e199143b2eaf3e0e54789933)

I slowly woke up to the sound of my alarm clock with the music of the morning radio. Still tired, I quickly pressed the button to shut it down and layed back into the cushions of the bed. Looking to my left, I saw the empty spot where just a few weeks ago, V lay. I felt a sting of hurt in my core but quickly pushed the thought aside. Nothing can change the past, the only thing we can change is the future.

With a groan, I pushed away the covers, stood up and put on my clothes. Just as I was done, I heard a yawn and smiled as I looked at the floor on the edge of my bed. Loyd, my corgi, had just woken up too.

As soon as he noticed me, he barked happily and walked over towards me on his short paws. I crouched down and petted him, earning another few happy barks in the process. After a few minutes, I stood up and we walked out of the bedroom and down the hall, walking by the bedrooms of the other in the process, hearing them waking up too.

While walking down the stairs down to the ground floor, I remebered the funny process of how we came to living together in a mansion. At first, when we started expanding onto the surface of the planet all those years ago, I wanted to live in a decent sized house on my own, but N realy wanted us all to live together as a firned group, and long story short, it happend. We were careful though that even with it being an older design, it didn't look like the manor where J, V and N lived back when they were still worker drones. To avoid causing PTSD.

As I entered the kitchen, I took some bread, some nutella and made a sandwich. Leaning against the counter, I started the coffe machine and it was not much later that a grumpy and still very sleepy L walked in.

""Good morning bro."" I said, still munching on my sandwich.

""No talk, coffee first."" L said, grabbing a mug and fillingnit with coffee, chugging the first one in 1 gulp before drinking the second one at a much calmer pace while turning to me.

""Good morning commander. Slept well?"" He asked.

""Dide, you know that we're off duty we don't call each other by-"" I stopped mid sentence when I saw his grin.

""Oh you asshole! You were messing with me!"" I said, while playfully smacking him on his shoulder. After which we had a good laugh about it.

""Oh, right, almost forgot."" L said before changing one of his hands into a holgram projector and showed a projection of...a starfighter?

He continued talking. ""Some of our spies in the remnants of the Republic, that corrupt faction who's capitol system we destroyed with Starkiller base, reported to me yesterday that they found these starfighter designs. Apparently the Republic had designed them but wasn't really using them. I thought you should know before we head to work today.""

I looked at the description next to the image of the starfighter, my digital eyes growing bigger with each word.

""You're telling me they had desinged THAT BEAST  and weren't using it?! Why?!"" I asked, seeing the sheer power of the fighter, it far outclassing the best fighter jets of our own.

""Cost."" L answered. ""Apparently they costed 400.000 credits to produce per unit, and maintenance was way more complicated and more expensive than their regular fighters. But they were building them at a small scale in only 1 factory using custom mad-parts. If they had been producing them at a bigger scale they would have cost a lot less. Plus there are probably other ways to make it cheaper without weakening the fighter.""

I thought deep for a few seconds before speaking again. ""You know what? Let's give this task to J. Let her see how we could begin making this our new main starfighter while reducing the cost to a more manageble level. Even with our military budget having more room with Starkiller base being completed, it still is pretty damn expensive. Both the fighters themselves and the refits that the hangars in our carrier ships will have to undergo if we use these things. Given how she so much into this whole corporate thing it should not be too difficult for her to figure it out.""

L nodded. ""I'll let her known once she is awake and we depart for work.""

""Oh btw, what did the Republic call this fighter?"" I asked while looking at the hologram again.

It took him only a second to answer.

""The TIE defender.""

1hkycia,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1hkycia/spiraling_spoiled_surprise_christmas_present/,Spiraling: Spoiled Surprise Christmas Present,"Hey everyone! 

Literally my first time posting something like this ever, so bear with me. 

TL:DR I think I spoiled a really serious gift that my (M 24) partner‚Äôs (M 25) family got me. I don‚Äôt know for sure, but there‚Äôs a good chance. What do I do?

So, I wake up this morning and go to the kitchen to make coffee and start the day. For background, I live in an old townhouse community with a parking lot for all of the residents, i.e. many units directly connected but with separate entrances from the outside. I look out my kitchen window and see, directly parked right by the entrance to our house, a black Jeep with a green bow on the dashboard. My first thought immediately is woah whoever got that is very lucky because that would be awesome! I took a picture and sent it to my partner and said something to that effect and joking asked if he bought me a car, and I got an ‚Äúlol‚Äù in response. Usually he would give me shit for saying something like that, but his response made me think more about the whole scenario.

Now, I am almost sure his family bought it for me. When I last saw his parents, my future in-laws, over Thanksgiving they gave us an advent calendar (a traditional gift) and another gift they send not to open until Christmas with them on FaceTime. Therefore, I know that there is some kind of surprise planned. Even logistics-wise, the act of buying a car over the phone in another state and my partner picking the car up without me knowing and parking it seems really plausible for me. 

All of this thinking happened and I started to get really upset because I feel like I ruined something that could‚Äôve been awesome.

How do I move forward? Do I ask my partner about it? I don‚Äôt foresee being able to stop stressing about it, which is just going to ruin it more. ",1,1734990644.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

","https://reddit.com/link/1hkyb5v/video/lip6ey6b5o8e1/player

Hey there. If you‚Äôre watching this in real time, you know, it‚Äôs the holidays and a very much needed time to talk about self care. But you know, any time is a good time. I‚Äôve found that it‚Äôs so common for there to be a lack of encouragement and support in our families and cultures in learning to truly take care of ourselves. And so many of us end up as adults, like flames flailing around in our lives, really not feeling very good at all because we haven‚Äôt taken the time to learn how to care for ourselves.

Self care is not just massages and vacations. Self care is, it‚Äôs any practice, any practice or activity that meets your own needs so that you feel nourished. Self care is really about filling up our own energy tank so that we feel resourced to go back out and rise to the occasion of our lives and our relationships. So this asks us to get to know what drains our energy and what fills us up.

So this is a very personal process that we must embark on if we want to feel well. It is our personal responsibility to get to know our needs and how to meet them. So this is a really radical notion for many women because women are conditioned to be self-sacrificial caregivers, to put all others needs first, hoping there is a time later for themselves, but that later doesn‚Äôt usually come.

So it‚Äôs time to flip the script and prioritize caring for yourself so that you have the energy, the patience, the openness and the desire to really show up in the other areas of your life. So let‚Äôs talk specifics. Self care could be something that meets your physical needs like getting outside and breathing fresh air, or brushing your teeth, or going to bed at a time that allows you to get enough sleep for yourself.

It could be meeting an emotional need like going to therapy or cuddling with your dog when you‚Äôre anxious, or calling a trusted friend to help you talk through a scenario. It could be meeting a spiritual need like reading poetry or meditating. These are just examples and there are infinite more possibilities. And like I said, it‚Äôs a very personal process of learning self care for you. So when it comes to spending time with family during the holidays, I‚Äôve found one essential piece of self care.

And this is what I call the adult timeout. This is permission to spend time alone so that you get to choose when you‚Äôre engaging with the family and when you have a little solo time to take a walk or go get a coffee or simply go in whatever room you‚Äôre staying in for 10 minutes or an hour and take an adult timeout nap, listen to music that you love or whatever makes you feel more grounded and ready to be with the family again.

Now comes the sticky part. You might not have any idea what you need to feel more resourced, or you might be unfamiliar with considering your own needs or that they exist at all. And if this is you, you are not alone. There are so many things that can block our ability to engage in self care, even if you technically know what is good for you. Our families and our culture really shape our relationships to our needs from a very young age.

Diet culture actively encourages us to detach from and deny our needs and disordered eating reinforces and entrenches our own separation from our needs and how to attend to them. So if you‚Äôre struggling with self care, there are resources for you. There is support and [**Food and Body Therapy**](https://www.juliahollenberg.com/food-body-therapy/) is one resource. One way to look at [**Food and body therapy**](https://www.juliahollenberg.com/food-body-therapy/) is that it is all about discovering and developing a personalized way of taking care of your body, mind, heart and spirit.

[Original post](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/05/someone-keeps-farting-in-important-client-meetings.html) \- May 24, 2021

I work in upper-middle management at a large business and  entertainment events company and recently we got back to regular  face-to-face client meetings. Over the last few weeks, we‚Äôve been having  some intense and lengthy meetings in our office with a potential local  client, which could really take our company to the next level if it  works out. However, a rather awkward problem has arisen.

During these meetings, which tend to last all afternoon, someone  breaks wind, silently, usually more than once. The odor is, frankly,  overwhelming, yet there is not much in the way of any clear reaction  from anyone in the room. I have noticed some people very, very  discreetly eye each other suspiciously. But it‚Äôs quite a formal and  stiff atmosphere, with several very serious and no-nonsense senior  executives present from both sides, so it appears if people are just  doing their best to ignore this rude interruption. During one of the  wind-breaking incidents, a junior member of staff sat with her elbow on  the table and put her hand over her hand and mouth trying to make it  look like she was just resting her head, while another junior member  looked uncomfortable but kept her head down and stared at her notepad.  On another occasion I noticed one of the clients frowning and looking  out of the corner of their eye, but frankly I dare not catch anyone‚Äôs  eye, so I always quickly avert my gaze to avoid any awkwardness or, god  forbid, suspicion.

Everything at our company is business-like and relations are  generally good. I know everyone reasonably well on our side, so I had  assumed the culprit was from the would-be client‚Äôs team. But imagine my  horror when, after the clients had left our last meeting leaving our  team to continue the discussion among ourselves, the silent boardroom  farter struck again! I was incredulous ‚Äî there were three senior male  executives in the room and two junior female members of staff who were  not always present at other meetings. So I am fairly certain the culprit  is a senior management figure at our firm.

I‚Äôm completely at a loss as to how to deal with this. I‚Äôm quite  ambitious and have invested a lot of energy into making this project  happen. So I can‚Äôt believe that a senior company member is behaving in  such a rude manner and potentially jeopardizing it by acting so  unprofessionally towards potential partners. The potential clients  cannot have possibly failed to notice the smell, and I can only assume  they are simply being polite and professional by ignoring it. However, I  am just afraid that there are limits to anyone‚Äôs tolerance and that  sooner rather than later they will decided one way or another to end  their interest in working with us.

This is just such a strange problem. How on earth can voice my concerns to my superiors?

[Update](https://www.askamanager.org/2021/07/update-someone-keeps-farting-in-important-client-meetings.html) \- July 26, 2021

Thought I would give an update on the farting in the boardroom  story of a little while back as the issue did not go away and things  turned out a lot differently than how I expected.

So there were another 4-5 meetings. The farting continued, in  some meetings it was worse than others. It did seem that those scheduled  in the morning were less gassy affairs, although by no means did  attendees enjoy fresh air for the entire duration of those. Despite the  regular bouts of nostril-burning flatulence wafting throughout the room,  it became clear we were going to be working with this client on a long  term basis and the atmosphere grew a little more relaxed accordingly. On  one occasion near the end of a meeting someone cracked a very funny  joke, which provoked an outburst of communal laughter, during which  someone, presumably involuntarily, let out an audible fart. It was  short, not very loud, and if anyone noticed it they didn‚Äôt let on.  However, whilst I couldn‚Äôt be sure if everyone heard it, it was  certainly smelt by everyone. The eye-wateringly foul stench wiped the  smiles off some faces and replaced the amused expressions of a few  others with frowns. This seemingly brought this particular meeting to a  slightly premature end as the most senior member of the client team rose  to his feet and said without a hint of irony, ‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs probably as  good a note as any to end on for today.‚Äù It was unclear if he was  referring to the funny joke cracked moments earlier or the fart, indeed  he seemed a very sharp individual who probably realized it was a perfect  moment for ambiguity. But I have to admit the sight of everyone‚Äôs eyes  darting around the room as people tried to gauge each other‚Äôs reactions  to try and figure out exactly what he meant was an amusing one. But not  as amusing as moments later watching senior management leaning over the  table exchanging farewell platitudes and shaking hands whilst yet  another stinking fart assaulted everyone‚Äôs noses.

It got to the point where people let their guard down a bit and  became a little less restrained in hiding their reactions. An electric  fan mysteriously appeared in the corner of meeting room one day, but it  wasn‚Äôt used for the first meeting it appeared in, probably as it was an  early morning affair with limited silent and deadly emissions. But  during one particularly gassy afternoon episode a week later, one of the  clients, a younger female, was sat with the corners of her mouth  pointing downwards and using a piece of A4 to fan the air, trying to  make it look like she was just trying to cool her face. Our director saw  this, and asked the junior member sitting nearest the new fan to  ‚Äúswitch it on please, seems its getting a little hot in here‚Äù with a  completely straight face. On the fan went ‚Äì but the speed was set on a  higher speed than anticipated and all that happened was pieces of paper,  meeting notes, and a newspaper were blown off the table and flew around  the room along with the familiar pungent stench. Thankfully this was  laughed off, and I took advantage of the interruption to suggest a  break, as we left the office juniors to clear up the chaos. During the  unplanned interval, I noticed our most senior executive had hung back to  help reorganize the room. This was most out of character, but it turned  out he just wanted to get the newspaper, which had been blown inside  out.

Seconds later he emerged from the room and walked towards the  gaggle of us who were drinking coffee and chatting in the open plan area  outside the meeting room. He radiated a beaming smile as he strode  right past everyone in the direction of the men‚Äôs restroom with the  newspaper tucked under his arm. Seeing that he didn‚Äôt return to the  meeting room for a good ten minutes after everyone else had, it didn‚Äôt  take Sherlock Holmes to deduce why he had been so eager to get his hands  on some reading material. This brazen and unashamed approach to  bathroom business quickly led me to place him in the number one position  on the silent boardroom farter suspect list. I also especially noted  there were no more silent-but-deadly interruptions for the remainder of  that meeting, which went on for a further three hours or so.

During our very last meeting, which was to seal the deal, there  was an awkward culture clash. We work in a multi-national office in a  major Asian city. English is the working language, and between us and  the client team everyone speaks English fluently, but there is a varying  mix of comprehension of our host countries language. All of our senior  executives are westerners and unable to converse in the local language.  I‚Äôm not a local but I‚Äôm fluent in the local lingo. During the meeting,  two maintenance men wearing overalls entered the room and announced they  were responding to a report of a fault in the ventilation system. But  both the workers were not fluent in English, so I did some on the spot  interpretation, to which our most senior executive replied, ‚ÄúPlease tell  the janitors the air con and ventilation system are working fine, we  have important business to conclude today.‚Äù

I duly interpreted. But the workman, not at all concerned with  the subtleties of boardroom etiquette, bluntly replied in the local  vernacular ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no ventilation problem? It smells like shit in  here!‚Äù which basically caused the half of the room who could understand  to laugh and the other half to respond with smiles and looks of  curiosity as to what exactly was said. Thinking on my feet I didn‚Äôt  translate anything back to my side, but urged the maintenance guys to  come back in a few hours because it was a really important meeting and  we really had to get on with it. It was a ruse which seemed to impress  the client executive who is also fluent in that language, and offered my  side a way to continue without drawing more attention to the constant  bad smells than was necessary.

The deal ended up being signed off and it was decided both teams  would go out for dinner and drinks to celebrate. Sure enough the drinks  flowed and both sides let their hair down as the night drew on. Whilst  chatting with one of the clients, someone of similar level to myself,  and with a few drinks in me, I couldn‚Äôt help but bring up the farting  issue. The client replied, ‚ÄúOh, that was our boss, we‚Äôre soooooo sorry  about that! He‚Äôs a great guy but sits there in our office telling dick  and fart jokes all day, he says it‚Äôs an example of ‚Äúthinking out of the  box‚Äù to make our team more relaxed comfortable with each other. So after  each meeting we were telling him to quit passing gas. He would deny it  each time but the whole thing had just became a running joke for our  team so we just rolled with it, sorry!‚Äù

Very surprised by this revelation, and at the level of humor  coming from such an otherwise professional and serious team, I felt it  best to just laugh it off and not reveal real source of the reek. But  emboldened by this, days later I ran into our senior executive‚Äôs PA (who  was usually in the meetings) and asked her straight up if the guy had a  wind problem. ‚ÄúOh yeah,‚Äù she replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad my desk is outside, he  just sits and farts in his office room all day and just doesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù

I ended up feeling like I was the one who had the problems all  along ‚Äî a keener sense of smell than most, not especially amused by fart  jokes, and a little naive ‚Äî seniority level and attitude to public  farting are not necessarily linked!

*Some interesting comments discussing the reveal:*

>SO THERE WERE TWO FARTERS?!?

>Fart twist!

>A Shyamalan-worthy twist, indeed.

>Wait, I thought that the OP‚Äôs senior executive was the farter, but the  client‚Äôs team assumed that their boss was the farter because he tells  fart jokes all day as some sort of management technique (which is a  whole other world of hurt). So the client‚Äôs team‚Äôs boss is being falsly  accused of being the farter.

>Hmm, re-reading it, you could be totally right!  
OP says ‚ÄúI felt it best to just laugh it off and not reveal **real source of the reek**‚Äù so she probably shares your interpretation.  
On the other hand, the client seemed very sure of themselves and the  fact that boss denied it doesn‚Äôt really mean anything (or does it? Would  someone like that simply be delighted in speaking of his farting  endeavours after the fact?).  
I see this whole thing remains mysterious.

>The client team probably assumed he didn‚Äôt want to admit to farting in  an important meeting. And they just didn‚Äôt believe him because he‚Äôd  cried fart too many times before. So the OP was mortified about her boss  farting, but it turns out the client thought it was coming from their  side. This is insane.

>What are the chances both bosses were in on it and having a fart battle to the death?

>Honestly, I think it had to be both of them. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if  they emboldened each other even if they weren‚Äôt feeling competitive  about it! But I am sympathetic to the OP ‚Äì I would be completely  unamused and grossed out by this entire situation.

>That‚Äôs the impression I got. OP knew it was their exec, but the client assumed it was theirs.

>This. OP‚Äôs exec has a ‚Äúwind problem‚Äù but the client‚Äôs team isn‚Äôt upset  by it because they think it‚Äôs their boss doing it, and fart jokes are a  thing for them, so his denial just makes him seem more culpable.

Does he like me? Why now?,"I tried to hook up with this guy I go to the gym with and got rejected: didn't want to mix work and personal stuff. No biggie, I was quite pissed at the time(around 1 and half month ago) because of how he had been acting: very flirty and way too physical, but we talked it through and he apologised for how he had been acting.

We were already on good terms as we share a lot of geeky hobbies, but removing the sexual tension just made everything easier and we found ourselves talking about all kinds of topics irl and sometimes messaging about them too.

I was happy with my new found friendship: I still found him extremely attractive and nice, but I was happy to just get along with him and have someone to yap with.

Around 3 weeks ago he told me he had broken up with his fwb: he was talking about how he was fed up about his relationships not going anywhere and his lack of ability to love someone romantically and that he had been going to a psychologist for it and wanted to work on it. He stated 'There has to be something else that isn't just sex', which I do agree with but I couldn't really understand him as I've only had long term relationships and have no trouble loving people.

I was happy about him working on his intimate issues, but after that he has been acting weirder and weirder and, because of our past, I don't know how to process it all.

The first weird instance was around 2 weeks ago where out of the blue he hugs me and kisses the top of my head. The day after we see each other and after we part he messages me inviting me out to dinner as he has 'important things he wants to talk about and he doesn't feel free to talk about them at the gym'. We had not met outside of the gym at this point.

We see each other a few days after and he states he wants to go out as friends and that it has been too little since he broke up with his fwb and wants to figure himself out. I was a little bummed as I thought it was a date but he still stated he was going to pay for the dinner.

The non-date day arrives and he drives 30 mins to get here(I thought he was working in my city that day but he wasn't, so he drove just to eat together), after 5 mins I complain he's walking too fast and he offers to walk arm in arm so we can move at the same speed. We have dinner, talk about work/life/hobbies and he makes a couple of jokes that I could call flirty. We walk around the city for around an hour and he walks me home, during the last 10 mins he even says 'Let's stop being so unaffectionate' and we proceed to walk in the most uncomfortable position: his arm wrapped around my shoulders holding my bag while i hold his side with my other arm.

Just a very weird non-date in my opinion, but it just keeps getting worse.

The day after we see each other again and afterwards he invites me to eat together again the day after, when we are both done working out and it's the end of the week.

I catch a fever and still go through with it but we are both completely dead: we eat our food and as we are waiting I am holding his hands on the table, thinking he'd just move away if he just sees me as a friend and I was way too out of my mind because of the fever to care. He doesn't move away, instead he holds mine too. We go for a walk, still arm in arm like the non-date before, and he doesn't move away when I place my head on his chest, instead he feels weirded out/shy at first (I could tell by the way he sort of jumped when I did) and after he just puts his head on mine and kisses the top of my head again. While we are walking he wants me to touch his arms (this is some fucking weird kink gym bros have) but we still never kiss. Not even close. But we have both stated we find each other good looking.

Through all of this he's getting more physical when we are working out and it feels like there's always just the 2 of us when I have class. He picked me up like a fucking rock today out of the blue and just randomly hugs me/touches me whenever we are close. Never in a sexual way, he just acts like a child that is trying to be physically close to his crush. He also teases me like a teenager and asked me to punch his shoulder...? Which I did and I half missed and he just died of laughter, which was fair.

I feel like a complete moron typing this out because it's so fucking clear he's into me and he has told me he had troubles showing affection because of his upbringing, but I think the nail on the head was him telling me he made a hand-made gift for my birthday and, because he won't be here that day, I invited him out the day after and we are going out for a coffee (neither of us like it and when I asked him if he liked coffee he said 'It's a good excuse to see each other').

I don't know if I should kiss him, ask him what he thinks about me, wait for him to figure himself out or murder him at this point. This is not a teenager, we are both in our mid 20s, but he's never had a proper relationship and, because of his work and what he has told me, it feels like I am the first girl that isn't just after his body but that actually enjoys spending quality time with him. I don't think this is a mastermind plan to fuck me either as he had the chance before and flat out refused me, so I don't know what to make of this mess I've just written and there's plenty of episodes I am forgetting that are just as weird.",2,1734989743.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

To top it off, my former roommate works at the firm who did the class action against Wells Fargo and their office is 10 minutes away from my house. Kind of seems like destiny.... Despite their repeated, intentional, and maximum effort fuckery especially on the spark platform I've got a soft spot in my heart for Walmart. Branch I don't give a damn about they're likely cooked anyways. 

Those of you who know about Optix  - 1.3 GB of potential screenshots/videos/posts related to Walmart/Branch issues, there's enough material there to negotiate down to 25% lawyer fees and forfeit any extra benefits/compensation as the lead plaintiff I'm cool with my estimated $2,250 in junk fee refunds.

I am 100% sure he took the phone. I lost it earlier in the evening and as I was looking for it near where he was sitting, he handed it to me from under the sofa armrest shut down. At the time I didn't think much of it but I am now certain he shut off the phone and hid it because I definitely didn't shut it down and my phone had full battery.

I then checked my phone and placed it down on the coffee table. After that it disappeared and all calls went straight to voicemail meaning it has been shut down. He then left the room and FaceTimed his friend to talk about an incident at school where he was accused of stealing a phone, all the while the people in the house were looking for mine.

After an hour of searching and after I told the adults in the house what I heard him say and how he had handed me my phone turned off earlier, we began to suspect him. As he is a foster child and autistic, we were careful not to accuse him directly. We asked everyone in the house to turn out their pockets including him. His pockets were empty however, we noticed there was a phone sized shape in his trousers, making us think he hid the phone in his boxer shorts. Obviously we didn't want to ask him to take off his trousers but the phone outline was clearly there.

After he left the family friends house, we checked find my iPhone and my phone appeared at the foster parents house which confirmed our suspicions. We went to their house and told them what find my iPhone said and asked him again if he knew where the phone was. He said he didn't and even offered to show us videos about finding an iPhone. He keeps saying he doesn't know where it is and has been pretending to look for it with us. 

We have tried various things since then. The social worker came to his house to talk to him and search his room but found nothing. The foster family have searched the whole house but couldn't find it. We've offered him money to find it but still nothing. He's a 14 year old foster child and autistic which makes things difficult. We don't know what to do. His foster mum took him on a walk outside the house yet the Find my iPhone remained at their house making us think he's hidden it in the house. I don't think the police can do anything at this point. Does anyone have any advice?",1,1734989717.0,Autism_Parenting,2,0.67,False

1hky0xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hky0xi/i_31m_think_my_ex_33f_may_have_been_emotionally/,I (31M) think my Ex (33F) may have been emotionally abusive. Is it worth trying to maintain a friendship?,"

TL;DR we had a pretty rocky relationship of 7 years and severe communication issues we were never able to resolve. I realised I wasn‚Äôt ever going to be happy long term and ended things when I realised we would be much better as friends. Four months out and I‚Äôm starting to wonder if she even wants friends or if I was just her play-thing. 



My ex (33F) and I (31M) split about 4 months ago. Reflecting on some of our weird interactions throughout our 7 year relationship has me realising she was actually pretty awful. I am abhorrently bad at managing context but I‚Äôve tried to keep this as tight and focused as possible. I know emotional abuse is in the patterns of behaviour not on individual scenarios and I can definitely provide more - but these are the ones that stick out in memory. I also probably wasn‚Äôt entirely without my own amount of bullshit coming from a family of petty emotionally manipulative assholes. Separating that from how I maladapted throughout this relationship has been a doozy I tell ya what.


Here‚Äôs a few scenarios: 

1.
She pulled out of a friends wedding at the last minute (day before) by telling me her weekend plans (seeing friends, shopping). When I reminded her about the wedding she said she had to work. I Pointed out the obvious non work plans and she told me she only had to work on Saturday but didn‚Äôt see why she shouldn‚Äôt be able to use her Sunday how she liked. She reminded me of our earlier conversation where she warned me that sometimes work would interfere with her personal life and there was nothing she could do about it. We had both travel and accomodation booked. I was pissed and expressed myself in the most emotionally mature way I knew how. Stating calmly and flatly that I felt angry. She responded with ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do about that.‚Äù

Later that night in bed she was acting like nothing was wrong and tried initiating affection. I didn‚Äôt feel like being affectionate and was probably being a bit passive aggressive expressing my unaddressed grievances. She eventually stopped and asked me to sleep on the couch because ‚Äútonight hasn‚Äôt been very nice for me.‚Äù

2.
Taking a cab back from her friends place where we had dinner. I got in the cab after her and immediately felt off. I can‚Äôt explain it and I was probably over-reacting but my brain told me we had to get out of this cab and take another one. I told her I wasn‚Äôt feeling comfortable with this cab and driver and suggested we just get another one. She didn‚Äôt understand and said we were already here and just let‚Äôs go. I re-iterated my (admittedly unjustified) concern and asked more directly for us to take another cab. She again didn‚Äôt move and was very confused. This time I said that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in this cab and I am going to take another one and asked her to come with me. Again didn‚Äôt move. I got out and leant through the open door, implored her to come with me to take another cab. She again didn‚Äôt move and said she didn‚Äôt see why we should take another one as we were already in this one. 

I got home to find her door closed so slept in the other room. (Context: we lived together as a romantic couple but had seperate rooms. We mostly shared her room on the weekend and slept separately during the work week). The next morning she got up and left the house without talking to me. She has used the silent treatment before when she was upset with me. I called it out immediately the first time. The second time I gave it a day. Both times she claimed it wasn‚Äôt the silent treatment, that she just needed space to process things. I can‚Äôt tell you how, and I am aware I‚Äôm a pretty sensitive person but I knew this was punishment. The silent treatment doesn‚Äôt feel like a temporary gap in communication (like when someone is busy at work or just having a bit of quiet time). It feels like an incredibly loud expression of contempt. This time I decided to take it at face value and let her have that space, and let her come to me when she was ready. She did not. I lasted a week living with her and not exchanging a single word. Her coming home from work, preparing her food and shutting herself in the bedroom for the night. It was excruciating. I finally confronted her, incredulous that she has given me the silent treatment for a week. Her immediate response was ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre doing it too.‚Äù Claimed she woke up to find my door closed and thought I was shutting her out. I didn‚Äôt know how to argue this at the time or how to reference the historical context of her using the silent treatment. We eventually got to talking about the cab situation. I explained that I may have been overreacting but at the time I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with that cab and driver and just wanted us to take another one. How I tried to explain this at the time and asked her multiple times to come with me. She was upset to learn that  thought the driver was unsafe and that I could leave her there in a cab I didn‚Äôt think was safe, slamming a door in her face. We didn‚Äôt talk about this further. 

3.
A few days before my birthday I headed into town to run some errands. I left early and packed the switch she had given me that Christmas. While she gifted it to me, there was some mutual understanding that we shared it. When I popped into the bedroom to say goodbye she asked me ‚Äúwill you leave the switch.‚Äù I said I was taking it. She repeated her question. I explained in more detail that I was taking it with me. She didn‚Äôt engage in anything I said and only asked again. In hindsight I realise she may have been giving an instruction or request, not asking a question for information. Chalk it up to cultural differences. She called me a few hours later to express that she was upset that I took it. She said I was being selfish and should know that was her only day she could play it (I didn‚Äôt but it wouldn‚Äôt have been a hard deduction had I put more thought into it.) she messaged me later to reiterate the same grievances and complain that she was stuck home waiting for the cleaner without anything to do. I told her when I was on my way home with an eta. She messaged saying she had gone out for a coffee (naming where) and that I needed to be home to let the cleaner in. When the cleaner came they let me know when they expected to be finished (when one of us would have to be home by) I left to drop the switch off to her at the cafe she said she would be at. She wasn‚Äôt there. Messaged and she said she had moved on to another further down the road. I went to that cafe and she wasn‚Äôt there either. I messaged her again and she had moved on to a different place again. I went back home. 

Later that afternoon she messaged to say friends had invited her over for dinner and extended the invite to me. We exchanged some messages. I stated that things felt tense and it didn‚Äôt seem like she wanted to be around me. She said she wanted to have something nice to do after her awful day, but would leave it to me to decide if I wanted to come or not. It didn‚Äôt sound like it was that important for her or that she was phased by whether I was there or not - so I declined. She immediately replied saying ‚Äúwell I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll come to dinner tomorrow then - as i don‚Äôt see why i should give you my time when you won‚Äôt give me yours.‚Äù Readers note that this was a dinner planned weeks ago for my birthday. 

I left it there but later messaged her offering to pick her up after dinner. She accepted, giving me a window when she would be ready to leave and the address. When I arrived I messaged her from the car. She asked me to come inside so I did. Her friends greeted me and I learned she had told them I was sick. So there I sat with her and her friends while we weren‚Äôt on great terms pretending everything was fine other than I was unwell. We stayed another hour or so. She was completely relaxed and in a jovial mood.

The next day was my birthday. She had left the house without a word. She messaged me in the afternoon asking to go for a drive. I still wasn‚Äôt sure if she would be coming to dinner that night. I wanted to do what I could to fix the conflict and ensure she would come. We went for a drive and then had a walk and talk. We were pushing very close to the time we would need to get ready for dinner. I addressed her concerns and apologised for being selfish. She accepted it and then finally wished me a happy birthday. We got home and everything was back to normal. Then went out for dinner. 

Conclusion
It‚Äôs only been a few months without contact and already these scenarios are starting to seem much clearer in my mind. I spent the majority of our relationship knowing that something was alarmingly off but always had enough doubt in myself and awareness of my own history to heavily consider that I was the problem. I spent years going in circles within my own head to the point where it started impacting other areas of my life. I spiralled hard and finally came to accept it didn‚Äôt matter if she was abusive or not, I was unhappy and didn‚Äôt know how to be happy with her. I ended things absolutely terrified of being alone and losing her. I had to take the leap of faith I guess. I absolutely wanted us to stay friends. It was actually the realisation that ending the relationship didn‚Äôt have to mean goodbye forever that pushed me over the edge to do it. She asked for some space to process it and I want to accomodate that. 

While we had a lot of issues there was also a large overlap in our shared curiosities and interests. I still love her and care about her. I still want her to be happy. 

It may not surprise you but I haven‚Äôt heard a peep from her since and I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just too soon or if she is just holding out waiting for me to make the first move.

As the title says I created a website that gets jobs from company's websites and puts it in a central place. 

The issue is that platforms like LinkedIn & Indeed are filled with sponsored, outdated, reposted and sometimes fake job listings. This leads to you applying to hundreds of jobs when they probably aren't even making it to the company, causing you to waste time and burn out.

By applying directly through the company's website, you are cutting out all the noise and are more likely to find live/active jobs because companies tend to keep their career pages the most up-to-date.

But it would be impossible to go to each company page you could think of. Job hunting is an everyday task so you would have to repeat this daily.

So I created a central place where job listings from company's career pages are kept and updated. Click on a job you like and it brings you straight to the company's website to apply.

The website is completely free, no signup or login required. It has over 5k jobs so far (500+ remote jobs), US for now, adding more companies and jobs everyday.

She assumes that both of us sit around playing video games all of the time just because we are young.

1hkxpy9,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1hkxpy9/what_i_am_doing_wrong/,what i am doing wrong? ,"Okay, so since my reduction of hours (24h/week) i am working mostly friday-sunday. These last months it was very busy with less people on the floor (now we hired 3 new baristas which is nice), so it got a bit overwhelming for me. I can‚Äôt manage yet not to let stressful situations affect me. Especially in the position I am, with the responsibilities I have; and with my personality that cares for everyone‚Äôs well-being. I still tried to maintain a standard, however in rush times/when I have to do multiple tasks at once, I can get a bit complicated in my head and maybe my communication of tasks is not as good. Which I am trying now to change in a way that I communicate tasks throughout the day equally, instead of at once. Due to that, few partners went to my manager and complained (i still didn‚Äôt quite get exactly what was wrong) about maybe weekends being too much for me or something on that line.
That thing kind of hurt me in a way that I think for a year and a bit I tried my best to create an open space in which we can give feedback to each other directly, including asking at the end of every shift how everyone feels etc.
I couldn‚Äôt really address the feedback with partners directly of course, since every time I‚Äôd ask they‚Äôd say everything went great. 
I tried to be self-aware, cause of course I don‚Äôt want to affect the team, so I tried to change few stuff. However sometimes in rush times it can happen I am more direct while assigning tasks, or try to flex the deployment if a see something is not going great. I notice partners take it personally if I try to help, e.g bar is done (i supported all drinks), POS barista is busy taking an order, Uber is getting ready so sandwich is in the oven beeping - so I go to grab it ‚Äî> apparently for the POS barista it felt like I was trying to say they are not doing their job properly - I never said that! I am just doing my job to support! 
I noticed that partners keep a small ‚Äúgrudge‚Äù after this, so I am trying to understand how can I please everyone in a way. 
I don‚Äôt have tools like being a ‚Äúcool‚Äù supervisor, nor am I good with small talk, and most of the times I am just trying to get my shifts done and goals&tasks, I also love small talks and conversation, but I find it rather hard especially in the last period in which everyone just says they want to quit, they hate this job, etc etc. So I don‚Äôt know how to fix that.
A while ago, I think there was a standard, and everyone was keeping up, competitions and fun things, trying latte art, new experiment drinks, customer passion, everyone was on time for their shift, and mindful of the ‚Äúprocedures‚Äù. And it was professional, even tho of course we had moments of fun and silly laughter. 
I feel like now this standard is not applicable anymore, and the workplace is not even close to professional which I find very hard. Because while it‚Äôs important we are connecting, I had lots of instances in which I was ignored when I was talking/communicating the day; or for example partners who would talk over me, intrerrupt me, trying to come up with their own leadership, which okay I can encourage, but this is not feedback nor is it correction over something I am wrong about; I feel like baristas trying to always argue on that feels like an attack on my ‚Äúleadership‚Äù and I get confused.
And lately I felt like I am walking on egg shells. So if i give feedback is not okay because nobody takes me seriously, but if i don‚Äôt then it‚Äôs a problem because i‚Äôm not addressing the issue. If i give all tasks at the beginning with a shift is not okay because it affects how partners react, but if i give one by one i am ignored or overruled. 
Besides, for a while now I notice a trend: lots of them are friends between them which is good, that doesn‚Äôt mean they should show it on the floor (in a way that little groups are formed). For example, I am coming from the office cause I was doing something and I see 3 partners in the corner of the bar talking in a low voice, while our new barista is at the POS alone. I try to address it, but of course they get mad at me
Every time I try to address something, they get offended or upset, or they complain about my leadership. Maybe not lots of them but few. 

So, my thing is that, I don‚Äôt know how to explain that on weekends if it‚Äôs busy and we are understaffed, since we are all humans and no one expects from them to be professional and no one is in this team, why is this thing being forced on me? If I show I am stressed or overwhelmed, cause I cannot control it, but I am actively trying my best to overcome, push through and guide&help them - why is that so wrong? 
If I ask for feedback directly and no one says anything - why after a few moments I hear from manager otherwise? 
How am I supposed to connect on the floor when everyone yells they want to go home, they don‚Äôt like this job, etc etc- then why are we here? 
Why is everyone complaining about gossiping & not addressing issues - tho almost everyone continues to do so? 
How do I change this without taking too much on myself? This affected me heavily and hurts me. I can‚Äôt continue in this way that my leadership is always taken as a joke.
I know I doubt myself, but I also know enough to know that we are all here for the same reason - it is a good job, it has a good pay, and most of teams are so lucky to even have someone who cares that much. But because of personal things (e.g not matching personalities which happens in a team cause everyone is different; i cannot entertain them in a way cause i am not made for that so yes most of the shifts will be easy going & boring, or cleaning tasks and small chats, or coffee tastings and rush times) and personal preferences they tend to project that on my leadership - I noticed few times. Especially if they are closer to another SSV. 
Just because my leadership is different and maybe a bit more serious, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs wrong. And it‚Äôs causing me distress cause imagine leading a team that doesn‚Äôt believe in you anymore. 
And I think nobody is there anymore to explain what exactly a SSV needs to do, how many tasks we have. It‚Äôs not as easy, not at all. And if I know one thing is that I care too much , and I try to accommodate everyone, but that is tiring because it seems I can‚Äôt please anyone after all- if I am not likeable as a person, my leadership also gets affected.
I don‚Äôt know how to stress this enough but a team should support each other. Management team should support each other, we can‚Äôt go around and gossip of another SSVs, and it‚Äôs not a competition. We are there for the same goal. Other SSVs trying to argue with me on the floor in front of baristas I find that to be problematic -if you have something to say say it privately. You can use your voice and please do so, but not undermining the other person - is not a game. 
And I got caught up myself in this high school play (cause I cannot name it otherwise) but we are all adults - there‚Äôs is no one bad or good, we all are trying our best - so then why is my best not enough? 
And I tried to address it with my manager, not that lengthy because I didn‚Äôt have the means since we never had a proper chat, but I explained  that I feel unmotivated. However since now it‚Äôs two worlds of our store : one on weekdays, one on weekends, I feel like there‚Äôs no room for me to address. And if I try to, it backfires and there‚Äôs nothing I can do because it gives me more anxiety to have 2 ssvs (one in training) that are backing each other up , and the manager backs them up as well in almost everything. However I am not aware of that - mostly I am just alone. I don‚Äôt feel like i am part of the management team anymore. All communication goes within them, and looses its connection on the way to me. 
and as a last thing - a barista training as a SSV snapping at me in front of other baristas (new hire) and customers, always giving ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù in rush times, trying to correct me, being passive aggressive, tho I am training her & closing bar to let her close tills, pastry etc? and not even telling me what exactly is wrong (like an example). 
i don‚Äôt know how to handle this anymore :) 
And this is a cumulation of everything. sorry for the long yap but i have no one to talk with about this, not even my manager (last time i tried i got yelled at and dismissed). ",1,1734988825.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

About 6 months ago I was living down on the coast in TX. I was renting a place I was pretty happy in, really close to the ocean. Regularly walking by the ocean & finally getting back into a good routine. 
Finally, I was settling in somewhere & I felt I could start to give up coffee & really hone in on resolving my remaining lyme symptoms. 
I switched to drinking Rasa, gave up coffee, was able to regularly start lifting again. I was on the right path, I had more good days than bad. 
Then life got turned upside down again. Hurricanes, moving what felt like every two seconds, for the next 5 months. 
My symptoms came roaring back. Days where I just couldn‚Äôt function, the fatigue was unbearable, the neuropathy in my hands on a whole new level of bad. More bad days than good, life has become a general regular struggle again. 
 I‚Äôm settled somewhere again and I started doing the research again, I need these symptoms to get back in check. Came here as I did before & this time finally ordered Buhners book. Finally reordered my Rasa because I‚Äôll be able to hopefully get back on track & again give up coffee, yet again. With all the moving I had stopped drinking the Rasa & switched back to coffee only. 
Reading Buhners book recently & started order some of the herbs. 
This afternoon I made my Rasa, I had just gotten in the mail. I was reading the back and refreshing my memory on the herbs included in the blend. 
Wow.
It hit me like a ton of bricks!
That‚Äôs why I had been feeling so much better when I was living in that place by the ocean in TX. I was basically following most of the protocol & taking the herbs for my specific symptoms that Buhner outlined well in his book. 
Just wow. I hadn‚Äôt connected the dots until now. I‚Äôll report back to confirm if I do start feeling better again now that I‚Äôm reintroducing the herbs back. 
But I did want to share too because if you are looking for a maybe more enjoyable way to consume a lot of the herbs on the protocol I recommend looking up Rasa. I drink the Cacao one, it tastes like hot chocolate. 
Thanks to any of you for reading this little epiphany I needed to share. 
& general thanks to this community, so many of the symptoms I‚Äôve over come has been because of advice found in this community. We don‚Äôt often realize it but groups like this really can change people‚Äôs lives for the better. ",2,1734988720.0,Lyme,2,1.0,False

It seems that l've now entered an era with my wife where she is constantly viewing everything as an emergency, catastrophe, or persecution. I posted about some financial strain that she went off the rails about ‚Äî I resolved it and she is now upset that it ""took so long"", and is blaming me for causing her psychotic episode a few months back.

I don‚Äôt know how else to characterize her episode ‚Äî she was fixated on some very strong ideas of reference and did not sleep for three or four days. She won't see a psychologist, so all i can do is speculate, but apparently it is not unheard of for BPD people to have such an episode during a period of heightened stress. She blames me for it instead of realizing that most people can't be made to have such an episode unless it‚Äôs through extreme torture (I have empathy for her, I stayed by her side constantly throughout it, and I got her to come back to reality, but it was extremely traumatic).


She makes these extreme, grandiose statements about all that she is doing, saying that it‚Äôs up to her to take care of her family, but in reality she is the one imposing all of the turmoil. When I am at work, I will get epic book-length texts about something I did wrong at home (didn't fold the blanket, took the wrong coffee cup to work, etc.). Almost everything is becoming a provocation when I am dealing with her, to the point that I am dreading being home for the holidays over the next few days.

I guess I'm wondering if there is any way to defuse or deflect this. It wasn't like this a few months ago. There have been periods of intensity from her in the past, but it's really reaching an insane level. I know people are going to advise that I just leave her, but l have kids and she's made it clear that a divorce would be the opposite of a clean exit (she's been talking about how she's going to drag my name through the mud, not let me see the kids, etc. when upset). Then when she's happy, she's talking about how we ""just need to be more positive"" and ""can do anything together"". It's really exhausting. I‚Äôm very codependent on my wife. I‚Äôm not free of my own issues, though mine are much more benign (anxiety issues, codependency). 

The other thing is that when she ""split"" in the past, she would come back down to reality soon thereafter. Now, it's not happening and her splits against me are becoming more sustained. This is the most troubling part. Apparently I said something that was a major trigger. She told me she was leaving the state with the kids and started putting on her coat. I know she did this to scare and manipulate me, she‚Äôs occasionally done stuff like that before where she will pack a suitcase and say she‚Äôs leaving. Normally I will beg her to stay, but this time I had been trying to remain neutral and just said, ‚ÄúIf you leave with the kids, I will be calling the police.‚Äù She‚Äôs been obsessed about that threat now for days. Maybe it was stupid of me to say, I knew she really wasn‚Äôt going to leave, but I just got tired of being manipulated and being in the shared delusion. She likes for me to beg and break down and then she will talk about how she has to be the strong one, and it‚Äôs okay that she is the more masculine one. It‚Äôs pretty dark that I know this is going on psychologically, but am powerless to stop it and stop her, since the only way to do so would be the thing I fear most, which is to be apart from her.

I also tried the grey rocking method where I just remain stoic and unemotional while she was coming after me, and it turned out to be an insanely potent trigger for her. It made her become almost visibly unstable ‚Äî walking around off balance and tripping on her words. It‚Äôs not clear to me that it‚Äôs something that I can use reliably. In the past, just excusing myself has been the most effective, but now that it‚Äôs happening so frequently, I‚Äôd basically never be home.",3,1734988627.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

Let me set the scene: You‚Äôve had a long day at work, dinner somehow exploded all over your kitchen, your toddler is doing a full-body protest over the wrong color cup, and the baby is sobbing because you dared to put them down for *literally five seconds*. Meanwhile, you‚Äôre standing there, questioning every life choice that led to this moment and trying to resist the primal urge to scream into the void.

Welcome to gentle parenting, where you‚Äôre not just breaking generational cycles‚Äîyou‚Äôre also breaking your brain.

**Why Is This So Hard?**

Let‚Äôs be real: gentle parenting is exhausting. You‚Äôre trying to stay calm, present, and empathetic when your kid is testing every nerve you possess and some you didn‚Äôt know existed. Back in the day, our parents might‚Äôve yelled, ‚ÄúBecause I said so!‚Äù and called it a night. But here we are, attempting to explain the nuances of boundaries to a child who thinks a fruit snack is a valid dinner.

The thing about gentle parenting is that it‚Äôs not just about how we parent‚Äîit‚Äôs about healing our own inner child. You know, that little version of us who learned to people-please or shut down instead of expressing feelings. So when your toddler screams, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the WORST MOM EVER!‚Äù over a peanut butter sandwich cut into squares instead of triangles, it‚Äôs not just about calming them down‚Äîit‚Äôs about calming yourself down first.

And that? That takes Herculean strength.

**The Inner Dialogue of a Gentle Parent**

Here‚Äôs the thing they don‚Äôt tell you about gentle parenting: it‚Äôs 90% self-control, 10% wondering if wine at 11 a.m. is socially acceptable.

In moments of chaos, your brain sounds something like this:

1. **Angry You:** *They‚Äôre doing this on purpose. Look at them smirking. THEY‚ÄôRE TRYING TO DESTROY ME.*
2. **Gentle You:** *They‚Äôre just having a hard time. Their brain isn‚Äôt fully developed. They need compassion.*
3. **Angry You Again:** *I don‚Äôt care if their brain is developed‚ÄîI AM NOT A SAINT.*
4. **Gentle You (with a fake smile):** *Deep breaths. Stay calm. You‚Äôre the adult.*
5. **Toddler (in the background):** *Poops on the floor.*

Honestly, I think my toddler‚Äôs ability to stay emotionally regulated during a tantrum might be better than mine some days.

**But Seriously, Why Does It Work?**

Here‚Äôs the kicker: gentle parenting actually *does* work. Not immediately‚Äîoh, no, this is the long game‚Äîbut over time, it starts to pay off.

When you stop yelling and start validating your child‚Äôs emotions, you‚Äôre teaching them that feelings are safe. When you apologize after snapping (because let‚Äôs face it, we all snap sometimes), you‚Äôre modeling accountability. And when you stick to boundaries with love and consistency, you‚Äôre showing them that being firm doesn‚Äôt mean being mean.

I‚Äôve seen it happen with my own kids. After weeks of calmly narrating, ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you hit me; we use gentle hands,‚Äù my toddler actually said it to a friend at daycare. I cried in the car later because it felt like a tiny win in the endless war of parenting.

**What About When You Screw It Up?**

Let me be crystal clear: You *will* screw this up. I screw it up all the time.

There will be days when you yell, slam a door, or mutter curse words in the pantry while shoving chocolate chips into your face. There will be nights when you lie in bed thinking, *Wow, I really messed that one up.*

Guess what? That‚Äôs okay.

Gentle [**parenting**](https://connectcounselingcenter.com/parenting-challenges-therapy/) isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about trying. It‚Äôs about showing up, even when you‚Äôre tired and cranky and feel like you‚Äôve got nothing left. And when you do mess up? You repair.

‚ÄúHey, buddy, I‚Äôm sorry I yelled earlier. I was feeling really frustrated, and I didn‚Äôt handle it the way I wanted to. That wasn‚Äôt your fault, and I‚Äôm going to keep working on it.‚Äù

It‚Äôs humbling, but it‚Äôs also powerful. Because let‚Äôs be honest: how many of us grew up hearing adults apologize to us? Exactly.

**Finding the Humor in the Chaos**

If you don‚Äôt laugh, you‚Äôll cry, right? Gentle parenting has made me appreciate the absurd comedy of raising tiny humans.

* **The Cup Meltdown:** It‚Äôs funny in hindsight that a blue cup can ruin someone‚Äôs entire day. Toddlers are like little dictators, but with worse negotiation skills.
* **The ‚ÄúI Do It!‚Äù Phase:** Watching a preschooler struggle to zip a jacket for 20 minutes while insisting they ‚Äúdon‚Äôt need help‚Äù is basically like watching a sitcom about stubbornness.
* **The Repeat Button:** Nothing will test your patience like hearing ‚ÄúMommy! Mommy! Mommy!‚Äù 467 times before you‚Äôve had coffee. It‚Äôs maddening but also‚Ä¶kind of impressive?

When you lean into the humor, the hard moments get a little easier.

**Tips for Gentle Parenting Without Losing Your Mind**

1. **Take Breaks:** Step away when you‚Äôre about to lose it. Put the baby in the crib, lock yourself in the bathroom, and scream into a towel if you need to.
2. **Find Your Mantra:** Mine is, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt an emergency.‚Äù It reminds me to slow down.
3. **Laugh Often:** Watch silly videos, share memes with mom friends, or laugh at the ridiculousness of parenting.
4. **Lower the Bar:** Some days, success is keeping everyone alive.
5. **Practice Self-Compassion:** You‚Äôre not failing; you‚Äôre learning.

**You‚Äôre Breaking Cycles**

Here‚Äôs the truth: gentle parenting is hard because it‚Äôs healing. You‚Äôre not just raising kids‚Äîyou‚Äôre rewriting the script for your family‚Äôs future. You‚Äôre saying, ‚ÄúI refuse to let this trauma continue.‚Äù That‚Äôs brave. That‚Äôs beautiful.

And yes, it‚Äôs messy and chaotic and makes you want to scream into a pillow. But it‚Äôs also worth it.

So next time you‚Äôre on the verge of losing it, remember: You‚Äôre doing the hard, holy work of breaking cycles. Your kids might not thank you today, but someday, when they‚Äôre raising their own tiny dictators, they‚Äôll understand.

And when that day comes? Oh, you better believe you‚Äôll be sending *them* memes about blue cups and tantrums. Full circle, baby.

I had two fibroids removed one 8cm and the other 7cm. The 8cm one used to be about 10cm but it shrunk to 8cm. Not sure how. However the 7cm one grew from 5cm previously. They were causing me a lot of serious pain and trouble, particularly this year. I have tiny little ones that are apparently negligible still left inside. I still need to go and get another check up post op scan. 

My scar is in the bikini line, horizontal and long around 13cm or so. It is still healing. Not too bad but still looks gross. I feel like my scar is uneven like one side is more deeply cut and unevenly stitched while the other is perfect. My stomach is of course swollen, bloated and painful. I do have a pouch too, especially when I stand up or sit up, I‚Äôm worried that my stomach will stay bloated and pouchy and swollen. I know I have to wait till the scar heals to massage it. A c section massage is important I think for healing. 
Is there anything else I can do to ensure the scar heals in the best way? My doctor told me to use a silicone scar gel and dressing. Kelo cote dressing it‚Äôs called to stop keloids and smoothen the scar. Has anyone had any experience with this? 
I really don‚Äôt want it to look ugly and big and noticeable. I‚Äôm scared that it will have bubbles and look uneven and scary. 

I am still only sleeping on my back, head propped up with lots of pillows. Too scared to sleep on my sides. I want my body back. I want to feel like me. I want the pain and discomfort to go away forever. I know I won‚Äôt be able to be myself until at least a few months minimum. 

I am gassy and constipated due to all the painkillers. The pain is slowly decreasing overall but sometimes it hits me more then goes away, typically after movement or peeing. My mood is quite irritable, low and sometimes I lash out. I am short of breath quite often. Sometimes I can‚Äôt finish my sentences. This is improving though as days go by. I am very slowly becoming more independent however I still cannot do basic things myself, such as bending down, stretching up and picking things up. I managed to shower myself on my 3rd day of recovery, but my mum was on hand incase I needed any help. I recommend a shower stool incase you need to sit down. Sometimes I can lose my balance. I don‚Äôt even want to laugh or cough because it hurts my stitches and I don‚Äôt want to rupture them. A very sad and lonely and isolating feeling. I just want to feel like myself again but I know that I won‚Äôt be fully back to myself till a year.
They say 6 weeks recovery time but that is really just till you can go back to work. The doctors don‚Äôt really care about your healing afterwards, they don‚Äôt give you any real helpful information as they don‚Äôt even have it. Thankful for this sub for the support shown and the information shared. We really only have each other as only we know what we are going through. I feel like trying to do research on female health and fibroids but idk where to even start since there is so little out there. 

I am so scared my fibroids would grow back as I keep reading on this sub that‚Äôs what is happening to a lot of women. What‚Äôs the point in getting them removed and then having to keep cutting my body wide open and going through this hell again? I am trying to eat healthier by cutting out sugars, sweet treats, white rice, bread and coffee. Also having less red meat and more fruit and veg and green tea. But I feel like this is neither here nor there anyway as there is no solid proof this stops/shrinks fibroids but eating healthy is always good so.  

But, I also tried the castor oil method so rubbing it on my abdomen, pooling it in my belly button then applying a heat pack over night. Can‚Äôt say for sure if it works but I have a feeling it does shrink them slightly if you are consistent with it but again, no real proof. I personally believe one of the main causes of fibroids is stress. Stress, anxiety and depression. And not doing enough activities or being outside in the sun, just holed up at home. 

I really hope this doesn‚Äôt affect my future chances of getting pregnant. I do want a baby in the future, I am 25. This has added stress bc I keep seeing that the best time to conceive is within 1-2 years after having fibroids removed. My mother and grandmother had fibroids so in my case they were mostly genetic. But if this kept happening to me ngl I would end up getting a hysterectomy bc this is too much. Hopefully after having at least one child of my own first.
 
I had a long time to come to terms with the surgery, and what it meant. I prepared myself mentally, as much as I could. I kept putting the surgery off this entire year. But finally realised I can‚Äôt run away from this problem forever and don‚Äôt want them to grow bigger and things to get worse for me. 
A lot of women have fibroids, regardless of age or background, it‚Äôs more common than you‚Äôd think and they just continue to live with them as they don‚Äôt cause them any issues. Only when they grow big and cause pain and heavy periods or start degenerating, and affect your bladder or pregnancy then they become a serious problem. So don‚Äôt feel too alone I guess. Coming on this sub has helped me to cope a lot. 

Excited to see the good results of surgery, hoping that I no longer get random excruciating fibroid pains and my periods are no longer ridiculously heavy, painful and long and I don‚Äôt have to keep painfully peeing often. Trying my best to stay positive and looking forward to healing fully. Already I do feel a little better in terms of healing and it‚Äôs only been 10 days but it is a lot to deal with emotionally, some days are really bad for me. 

If anyone has had an open myomectomy or in general has any advice for me please do share and if you want any updates lmk. :) <3",5,1734988544.0,Fibroids,0,1.0,False

What guys expect to see from a good manner potential partner?

I read from a recent post that if a girl did not say thankyou after the first date, it is impolite.

Maybe more things to notice before officially going on the first day?

I dont know much about these guys because we are using dating apps and have no much things in common there. But they ask me out, for a walk, coffee, restaurant, for the first dates. And I simply accept these requests.

1. Chapstick. Doesn‚Äôt seem important until your lips are absolutely on fire because you‚Äôre not used to being outside 24/7. 

2. Safety glasses. You laugh, but go walking through the woods while trying to exercise light discipline and not take a branch to the eye. 

3. Instant coffee mix and/or some type of caffeinated supplement. If you‚Äôre bugging out on foot there‚Äôs a high possibility it‚Äôs a high stress scenario, you‚Äôre going to be pushing your body, and you‚Äôre going to need a little bump of energy. 

4. Some pain killers like ibuprofen. Again, many of you have never had to walk home from work and may not have proper shoes for the distance (hopefully you do) either way, you‚Äôre likely going experience some unexpected pain and soreness unless you have a habit of walking long distances under a load.

They have a Swiss passport. Could they just show up and get a job and fill in a few papers or is it more complicated?

Related question, are Swiss citizens authorized to work elsewhere in the EU? And does that require complicated paperwork?

Just for comparison in the US you fill out a  very simple tax form and an equally simple identity form, show your ID and that‚Äôs basically it for simple jobs. 

Having been to Berlin a bit it really seems like you could get by with English and very basic German at least to start. Swiss cities seem a little tougher in that regard. ",1,1734988406.0,askswitzerland,2,1.0,False

1hkxibs,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/1hkxibs/camper_furnace_blowing_fumes_inside_through_vents/,"Camper furnace blowing fumes inside through vents, burning my nose and eyes","I live in a camper full time since Hurricane Ida destroyed the trailer I was living in. Everything about my camper has been going well until last night around midnight. Luckily I had a coffee that was still kicking in so I was awake when my furnace decided to try to kill me late last night.

I live in south Louisiana so my furnace doesn't get used all that much, but it's getting chilly enough to use it now so it's been used quite a bit in the past month. I'm pretty sure it's gone through 2 full tanks of propane just this month 

It just suddenly started to smell weird and my eyes stared to burn, i immediately knew it was the furnace so I shut the heater off I went outside to inspect under the panel. When I pulled the exhaust  pipe piece out of the main exhaust pipe there was an alarming amount of water and some super thick caked on soot all throughout the pipe. I've never noticed that much soot any other times I've taken it apart to inspect it for wasp nests. 
I went to an auto parts store this morning and bought one of those snake camera things to see if there was a nest further in the system clogging the exhaust, and all I saw was soot and water pretty deep into the exhaust. I highly doubt that it was rain water that made it that deep into the system because like I said, I used it quite a bit this month and we haven't had any bad weather come through in a while.

I've done a good amount of research and I haven't found anyone having the exact same problem as me, so this is really my last resort. It's Christmas time so I don't think a mechanic is available to come Iook at it for me, and I really don't want to spend a bunch of money if it's something HOPEFULLY within my level of DIY skills. 

 Thanks in advance for any help anyone can give me. I do have space heaters, but I leave the furnace on for my cats while I'm away for work if it's too cold because I don't want to leave a space heater running all day when I'm not there.

1hkxgdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Federal_Anything2425/comments/1hkxgdx/imagine_a_game_where_you_build_a_startup_make/,"Imagine a Game Where You Build a Startup, Make Real Choices, and Show Your Success","Okay, hear me out‚Äîwhat if there was a game where you could build a business from scratch, just like in the real world, but it‚Äôs actually fun? Think something like The Sims or GTA, but instead of robbing banks or starting a family, you‚Äôre launching a startup, grinding to make it profitable, and navigating all the chaos that comes with being an entrepreneur.

Here‚Äôs the concept:
You start with an idea‚Äîliterally anything you want. The game has AI that evaluates how realistic or profitable your idea might be IRL. If it tells you your idea has a 10% chance of success and you‚Äôre like, ‚ÄúScrew it, I‚Äôm doing it anyway,‚Äù you can! It‚Äôs all about your choices.

From there, you go through the real steps:

Picking a state to register your business (and dealing with taxes, obviously).
Applying for an EIN and choosing a structure (LLC, S-Corp, etc.).
Writing a business plan, creating a pitch deck, and grinding to get funding.
But it‚Äôs not all spreadsheets and meetings. The game world is a fully open sandbox‚Äîlike, you can hit up networking events, hang out at coffee shops or co-working spaces, and actually talk to NPCs (or other players if it‚Äôs multiplayer). And when I say talk, I mean IMVU-style, with voice and text chat so you can build real connections.

You can go the no experience route (learn by trial and error) or start with an MBA, which gives you an edge but saddles you with ‚Äústudent loans.‚Äù Every decision affects how your business grows.

What makes it spicy:
You‚Äôre not just building a business‚Äîyou‚Äôre balancing real-life distractions too:

Go to a club? You might meet a big investor, but you could also embarrass yourself and hurt your reputation.
Spend too much time networking? Your team morale and deadlines suffer.
Ignore your stress levels? Burnout hits, and you start making bad decisions.
And if you hit profitability? Oh, the rewards are next level:

Buy a custom Lamborghini Urus and drive it around the open world.
Invest in real estate‚Äîpenthouses, suburban homes, you name it‚Äîand decorate them however you want.
Host launch parties or exclusive galas to show off your success.
The Real-World Twist
The AI isn‚Äôt just there to judge your startup idea‚Äîit actually teaches you real-world skills. Need to know how to make a pitch deck? The game walks you through it. Confused about marketing campaigns? It‚Äôs got you. And here‚Äôs the kicker: if you get good at the game, you could use the same strategies to launch a business in real life.

The economy in the game mirrors real-world trends, too‚Äîlike a recession might make it harder to get funding, but a boom in green energy could open new opportunities.

Bonus: Multiplayer
Imagine teaming up with friends to launch a joint venture, or competing to see who can hit $1M in pure profit first. Maybe you even trade businesses or investments in a player-driven economy. Or, you could just hang out in coffee shops and clubs, flexing your custom cars and designer outfits.

IDK, I just feel like this could be the ultimate combo of fun, learning. Would you play something like this? And what would your startup idea be?",1,1734988074.0,u_Federal_Anything2425,0,1.0,False

We were hesitant to tell his mom about the pregnancy because of the overwhelming control she has over his life‚Äîa concern he‚Äôs often shared with me. However, during a coffee date I planned to build a relationship with her (at his request), the pregnancy slipped out. She casually asked, ‚ÄúAre you going to have any kids soon?‚Äù I panicked and blurted, ‚ÄúWho told you about the baby?‚Äù Her reaction confirmed she didn‚Äôt know, and I immediately tried to backtrack, but the damage was done.

Fast forward to two weeks ago, while in the kitchen of the home my fianc√© and I share with his parents, she started ranting about baby names and declared, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to have a little [her name] junior.‚Äù Shocked, I replied, ‚ÄúMy child won‚Äôt share your name.‚Äù She got upset, called my fianc√©‚Äôs father into the room, and demanded answers. She said, ‚ÄúI thought you were naming the baby after one of us?‚Äù My fianc√©, looking guilty, said, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really talked about it, but we‚Äôll think about it, Mom.‚Äù

I immediately interrupted, ‚ÄúNo, we won‚Äôt. You‚Äôre not controlling this part of his life too. He‚Äôs 26, he's not your baby anymore.‚Äù I grabbed my keys and left to stay with my mom.

I‚Äôm adamant that our child won‚Äôt be named after a 51- or 62-year-old, but my fianc√© is siding with his mom, a recurring theme over the last 4 years. Despite complaining about her controllingness, he wont stands up to her. I told him I won‚Äôt return until he sets boundaries with her.

His mom has since bombarded me with guilt trips, abusive messages, and even TikToks about families breaking apart over baby names, and even tried claiming my fianc√© will leave me if I don‚Äôt change my mind.

In a surprising turn, my fianc√©‚Äôs dad reached out, saying his wife was in the wrong and that I was right to leave. Meanwhile, my fianc√© continues to defend her, and his sister, who usually mediates,has sided with their mom.

I feel alone in this, except for support from my mom and his dad. I‚Äôm furious that my fianc√© not only went behind my back to assure his mom the baby would be named after her or his dad, but also refuses to acknowledge how far she‚Äôs overstepped. I‚Äôve always tried to be understanding because it‚Äôs his mom, but this was my last straw.",407,1734987902.0,AmItheAsshole,170,0.95,False

I'm having difficulties with descaling my Magnifica S. I have followed all the instructions from the website step by step, but when the descaling process starts, water only comes out of the steam wand but not the actual coffee sprout. I've tried restarting multiple times but I can't get the descaling feature to work on the coffee sprout. Perhaps there is something wrong with the inside circuitry? 

Does anyone know how to fix this for issue? Please help a fellow coffee enjoyer in need.

I have a massive struggle and need to change,"So, I‚Äôm F28 and I have had insomnia all my life. Some of my earliest memories are laying awake at night, knowing my parents want me to sleep, and just being unable to do that. As a result, I have been having severe issues getting out of bed in the morning, also for as long as I can remember. Even at almost 30, I continue to oversleep, have super messy mornings, arrive last minute,‚Ä¶ I feel so embarrassed about this but NOTHING helps.

**Here are things that I have tried to combat the insomnia:**

- I have tried since childhood to have a healthy and continuous nighttime routine. I would get ready for bed always the same way, do something calm and relaxing, and then go to bed at an age-appropriate, reasonable time. When smartphones became a thing I limited my screen time. When I was introduced to caffeine drinks, I didn‚Äôt have any in the afternoon or evening. And so on. Anything that could get in the way of healthy sleep, I didn‚Äôt do. Still, I lay awake for hours and hours, and I just cannot sleep.
- I have also tried medication under doctoral administration (and, where necessary, sleep supervision). Over the years, doctors tried me on a large variety of meds from different angles (anything from sleep medication to anti-depressants). All of them did either nothing or had severe adverse effects or side effects. Melatonin also didn‚Äôt help (and yes, I did use it the right way, as discussed with my doctor).
- I have had therapy to deal with some underlying issues. It has helped a lot in many ways and improved my life significantly, but the insomnia remains unchanged.

I have at this point mentally given up on the idea that I might ever not have insomnia, and am working on accepting it.

**Here are things that I have tried to get out of bed:**

- All of the alarm clocks: Radio alarm clock (didn‚Äôt work), sunrise alarm clock (worked for about a week), alarm clock in a different room (worked also for about a week), alarmy to force me to do math and take a certain amount of steps (my sleep-deprived ass figured out how to disable/trick it, I will not tell you how so I don‚Äôt ruin it for other users, also I can do complex math in my sleep now), any combination of these. Always, after about a week, my brain has figured out how to beat the system and I do it before I am even awake enough to realize what is happening. Even if I switch up the order or places of things, I will turn everything off and find myself back in bed before I gain proper consciousness.
- Support from loved ones: My Mom used to bring some coffee or tea to my bed in the morning and now my wonderful partner does the same. I deeply appreciate it, but‚Ä¶ First of all, it doesn‚Äôt wake me up. And more importantly, I feel awful relying on someone else to do something so basically functional that even a child can do on their own.
- Having pets rely on me: I have two cats and thought that them needing me in the morning to be fed should be a valid reason to activate my brain. Apparently, and I am ashamed to say that, it isn‚Äôt. I have slept through my alarms, including subconsciously getting up to turn them off, more than three hours over my cats‚Äô feeding time.

**I honestly feel pathetic and like a completely dysfunctional sad excuse for an adult. I just wish I had this under control. Whatever you can think off or recommend, please tell me.**",2,1734987011.0,Mental_Wellness_Care,1,1.0,False

1hkx1k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/LegalAdviceUK/comments/1hkx1k9/autistic_foster_child_stole_my_phone/,Autistic foster child stole my phone,"Hi, yesterday my phone was stolen at a family friends house by another family friends foster child. I am 100% sure he took the phone. I lost it earlier in the evening and as I was looking for it near where he was sitting, he handed it to me from under the sofa armrest shut down. At the time I didn't think much of it but I am now certain he shut off the phone and hid it because I definitely didn't shut it down and my phone had full battery. 

I then checked my phone and placed it down on the coffee table. After that it disappeared and all calls went straight to voicemail meaning it has been shut down. He then left the room and FaceTimed his friend to talk about an incident at school where he was accused of stealing a phone, all the while the people in the house were looking for mine. 

After an hour of searching and after I told the adults in the house what I heard him say and how he had handed me my phone turned off earlier, we began to suspect him. As he is a foster child and autistic, we were careful not to accuse him directly. We asked everyone in the house to turn out their pockets including him. His pockets were empty however, we noticed there was a phone sized shape in his trousers, making us think he hid the phone in his boxer shorts. Obviously, we didn't want to accuse him of this. 

After he left the family friends house, we checked find my iPhone and my phone appeared at the foster parents house which confirmed our suspicions. We went to their house and told them what find my iPhone said and asked him again if he knew where the phone was. He said he didn't and even offered to show us videos about finding an iPhone. 

We have tried various things since then. The social worker came to his house to talk to him and search his room but found nothing. The foster family have searched the whole house but couldn't find it. We've offered him money to find it but still nothing. He's a 14 year old foster child and autistic which makes things difficult. We don't know what to do. His foster mum took him on a walk outside the house yet the Find my iPhone remained at their house making us think he's hidden it in the house. I don't think the police can do anything at this point. Does anyone have any advice?

1hkx0us,https://www.reddit.com/r/QuitVaping/comments/1hkx0us/need_motivation_2_days_in/,"Need motivation, 2 days in !!!","Warning this is gonna be a long post. I‚Äôm almost 3 days in, and I‚Äôve been doing okay so far. I‚Äôm home from college for Christmas break, and I feel like this was the perfect time so that I‚Äôm not experiencing the heart of withdrawals when I‚Äôm back in school next semester. I last hit my bf‚Äôs vape on Saturday afternoon, and I threw all of mine away before coming home for Christmas. 

It‚Äôs not Monday, and im doing fine so far, the cravings come and go. I think the hardest part for me is the oral fixation. I wasn‚Äôt too too addicted to the nicotine itself, but the habit of always holding it and hitting it is hard to get over. 

Whenever im occupied here doing something with my family, im fine. The withdrawal hit bad when I have downtime and im laying down and doing nothing. My mouth literally aches (I think ?????) I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but I feel like an absence in my mouth and it‚Äôs so frustrating, I was venting on the phone to my boyfriend earlier and started crying and it makes me so mad that a fruit flavored stick is making me this upset. I was also crying out of frustration bc he quit for 2 years but he's vaping again, and every time we've tried to quit together, he'll fold and buy another one. We started buying vapes with lower percentages and the long term goal was to stop buying them overall, and I haven't bought a vape since September. After my last one died, I wanted to stop buying them. When mine died, I'd go a couple days without buying one, and I'd just hit my boyfriend's, coworker's friend's, etc. Before I knew it, it had already been 2 weeks since I bought one. Then, my friends gave me theirs that were almost dead just because - I didn't ask them but I didn't say no when they offered. Since the last time we tried quitting in August, my bf has still been buying juice to refill his pods. Thankfully, however, the juice he buys is a lower nicotine percentage (3.4 instead of 5). I was crying becuase I was so mad that I feel basically alone in quitting right now. On the bright side, none of my roommates vape, so I won't be surrounded by it in my own apartment when I go back to school. But, everyone around me outside of my apartment vapes - my friends, coworkers, classmates. I was so frustrated because he was giving me so many great tips on how to ease the oral fixations, and how he knows I'm capable, but he isn't doing it with me despite saying he wants to quit by the end of the year. I asked him and he said he's more addicted to nicotine than I am (which is true, in the past the same vape would last him 3 days and me 10 days). Still, it just feels that much harder bc everyone around me who vapes says they wanna quit but I wish I wasn't alone rn lol. That's not the point of this post tho.

I‚Äôve quit for about 10 days before and done copious research and know of the tips and tricks to help. I‚Äôve been only drinking through a straw, which has been helping a lot. I‚Äôve also been drinking alot of soda and coffee, which has also been helping me but I‚Äôm worried about my dental health lol. I had 3 cups of both coffee and soda yesterday and don‚Äôt wanna make that another bad habit. I also don‚Äôt wanna keep snacking to keep my oral fixation going, which may lead to gaining weight from snacking all day. Does anyone know any other helpful things to ease the fixation ????

I just bought some fruity mint gum, and that‚Äôs been nice. I was just chewing it while I was driving and playing my favorite songs to stay focused on the lyrics while I drive. 

I‚Äôm also worried because my mom just told me earlier today that I‚Äôve been irritable and seem like I have a short fuse since I‚Äôve been home. Im 21, and my parents dont know I‚Äôve been vaping for years. I‚Äôm almost certain my irritabilty is bc of withdrawals, and idk how to combat this. I don‚Äôt wanna be short tempered and angry during the holidays. Im aware that at the end of the day, I‚Äôm an adult and this is mind over matter, but the actual physiological symptoms of not having nicotine rn are definitely not helping. 

As I'm writing this right now, my mouth feels so weird. I have the desire to like feel the vapor in my mouth like a throat hit ??? Idk if that sounds crazy lol

I reallyyyy wanna get a vape with 0% nicotine. I feel like it‚Äôll help with the fixation a lot more than everything else will ??? My bf was telling me that hitting one actually won‚Äôt help at all, and since I‚Äôm doing fine without nicotine, I now need to get over the habit and fixation - and buying a 0 nic vape will put me back at square 1. Does this help anyone ?? Or does it make it worse. If I get one, I‚Äôd like to keep it home and not bring it out with me, and only hit it during those times when I‚Äôm doing literally nothing and my mouth is going insane. I also wanna keep one when I‚Äôm back at school only for when I‚Äôm out drinking bc that‚Äôs when the cravings are the worst. I saw a girl on tik tok say that this helped her not ask people to hit their vape when she was drinking and to also help her with the habit of having it in her hand while drinking. 

Despite all this, this is going better than I expected, and I‚Äôm very excited to get past the hardest part soon !!! As of tomorrow, it‚Äôll be 3 days and the nicotine will be out of my system by then (I believe). Overall, I‚Äôm excited to look back next year and not be addicted to this anymore, and this will all be worth it so I really want to keep thugging it out.

The postmortem is beginning, and surveyed voters see the Democrats as self-important elites who don't care about actual issues, and are quick to silence dissent (*one participant compared the party to an ostrich because ‚Äúthey‚Äôve got their heads in the sand and are absolutely committed to their own ideas, even when they‚Äôre failing.‚Äù Another likened them to koalas, who ‚Äúare complacent and lazy about getting policy wins that we really need.‚Äù*)

I'm not sure how to fix this. The problem goes very deep, and isn't something that's just about Democrats. Trump's thugs actually sacked the U.S. Capitol-- back in the twentieth century, any politician that pulled this would be gone forever. I think what changed is people, especially right-wingers, stopped seeing the U.S. Capitol as the greatest organ of democracy in the world, and saw it as a bunch of crooks that might deserve a good sacking every once in a while. Trump's attempts to illegally stay in power wasn't an attack on us, it was an attack on them, because they don't work for us anymore. This isn't something Dems can easily fix by changing their electoral calculus.

But I think a good starting point is being more open.

Liberals also have a bad habit of being mad at things people enjoy if they don't conform ideologically. Joe Rogan and Bill Maher are the most trusted media figures in America right now other than Tucker Carlson, and whatever these guys's many faults they aren't necessarily natural conservatives and have broad appeal with normal Americans. We told everyone that an eighty one year old guy who hasn't held a cabinet meeting in two years should be President for another four years, and then when he fucked up too publicly our party elders rapidly replaced him behind closed doors.

After Trump got in, we started lionizing prosecutors, national security figures, and the scientific establishment, and being pretty tough on people who weren't conforming with them for whatever reason. We probably never would've heard from RFK Jr. if the phrase ""trust the science"" didn't enter mainstream discourse. As for prosecutors, they aren't the answer to Trump and his bad behavior. They enforce the law, as they should, but Trump's criminal activity is a symptom of the broader problem: a conservative right that doesn't think our government is legitimate. Same goes for government scientists and national security figures. If the government scientists were telling us noble lies about masks and lab-leaks during the pandemic, and the national security people told us there were WMDs in Iraq, people will not trust them, and that trust has to be restored first.

You might be thinking, ""but conservatives do this stuff too, and they're worse!"" And that's true! The right is ridiculous and cult-like. They've cancelled Disney, the most widely loved movies and musicians of the last couple years, Major League Baseball, and the U.S. Army. They have viciously purged their Party of disloyal elements. They nominated a seventy eight year old rapist and a venture capitalist who follows pederast accounts on Twitter. Their most prominent intellectuals are Catturd2 and End Wokeness. They call everyone who disagrees with them woke, a traitor, a RINO, etc. But that's the thing: it isn't supposed to be this way. There isn't supposed to be an equivalency.

One book I read says that a huge supermajority of Americans on social media very actively censor political discussion and go out of their way to avoid it.  And if you look at voters in 2024 that swung hardest to Trump, they were demographics that weren't super married to either Party's narrative, people who didn't follow traditional news sources. Politics by 2024 is, to most people, a bunch of crooks and their hapless cultists screaming at each other, and that inherently benefits Trump, JD Vance, and Elon Musk. That's the kind of environment people like them thrive in-- they are at their strongest when we don't trust the American dream and are constantly mad at stuff on our screens. When Americans actually believe in American ideals (and I really, honestly believe, maybe without good reason, that we will learn to believe in them again), we will never hear from these guys again.

Stephen Miller's $7 Victory Energy Drinks replacing Latin American coffee and immigrant kids being detained in Walmart will probably make it easier for Democrats to win, but if we actually want to fix this problem forever, we have to make this crooks and their hapless cultists vs. a system that's worth defending. I think part of that means being more open and slower to shout people down, and treating critics like fellow Americans and not disingenuous bullshit artists, even if many are.

My coworker ‚ÄúClara‚Äù and I both started mid-October and are both on probation. From the beginning, I‚Äôve had concerns about how tasks are handled. Initially, there was no clear division of work, and Clara‚Äîwho has done this type of work before‚Äîwould complete 75% of tasks before I could even start. This left me with no visibility, no opportunity to gain experience, and no tasks to complete.

I repeatedly asked Clara to divide tasks fairly, but she told me outright that she‚Äôs antisocial, doesn‚Äôt like sharing tasks, and prefers to do everything herself. A month and a half ago, I raised this with my manager, ‚ÄúSteve,‚Äù and he decided to split the work into regions. While this seemed like a step forward, Clara continues to overstep, completing tasks in my regions without informing me. This causes duplicate efforts and makes me look disorganized.

I‚Äôve also tried to improve communication with Clara. Early on, I would message her daily to align on tasks, share updates, and see if she was in the office. However, when I stopped initiating these daily check-ins, she stopped communicating with me altogether. We work in the same country while Steve works in another, so he doesn‚Äôt see the day-to-day issues firsthand.

In addition to her lack of communication, Clara has also undermined my contributions. For example:

	‚Ä¢	I casually shared an idea with her in the office, and later, she presented it as her own

	‚Ä¢	When we were tasked with creating a report, Clara didn‚Äôt know how to do it. I figured it out, shared my findings with her, and we agreed to send in a joint report the next day. That evening, she used what I taught her to create her own, better version of the report and sent it to Steve first thing in the morning as if she had done it all herself, dismissing my hours of work and willingness to collaborate


This all happened in the span of two months, which feels insane to me.

Today, during my first official one-on-one, I raised my concerns again. I explained that:

	‚Ä¢	Clara continues to overstep by doing tasks in my regions, undermining the regional division Steve set up

	‚Ä¢	This leaves me with fewer tasks, impacts my visibility, and makes it hard to contribute meaningfully

	‚Ä¢	Clara has said she doesn‚Äôt want to share tasks with me and prefers to do everything herself


Steve dismissed my concerns. Mid-sentence, he told me to ‚Äújust stop talking‚Äù and said he didn‚Äôt want to hear about Clara anymore. He suggested I limit my contact with her going forward and maybe ‚Äúget coffee‚Äù to talk things out. However, Clara has shown no interest in improving communication. For example, she never voluntarily tells me when she‚Äôll be in the office‚ÄîI used to have to message her to find out. Since I stopped reaching out, we haven‚Äôt spoken for a week.

Steve then suggested that maybe Clara should take on another region entirely. When I pushed back, saying that wouldn‚Äôt be a fair workload balance, he said he‚Äôd review it but suggested Clara might handle four regions while I handle just two.

Now I‚Äôm really worried. Clara once mentioned there might not be enough work for two people, and I‚Äôm scared that if she keeps monopolizing tasks, I‚Äôll fail probation and be let go. Steve doesn‚Äôt seem interested in addressing the core issue: Clara‚Äôs lack of communication, her overstepping, and how this impacts my ability to succeed.

I also feel frustrated by how dismissive Steve was. I came to him with valid concerns, backed up by specific examples, but he shut me down and doesn‚Äôt seem willing to deal with the problem. I‚Äôve decided I can‚Äôt bring this up to him again because I worry he‚Äôll see me as annoying or problematic, which could hurt my chances of passing probation.

How can I protect myself in this situation?

1hkwx3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smoothie101/comments/1hkwx3z/hydration_hack_why_smoothies_are_better_than/,Hydration Hack: Why Smoothies Are Better Than Water For Staying Refreshed,"Hydration Hack: The Refreshing Benefits of Smoothies Over Water
---------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to hydration, most of us often reach for a glass of water. While water is essential for our health, there‚Äôs an alternative that packs a punch: smoothies. These delicious blends not only keep you refreshed but also provide a multitude of nutrients. Let‚Äôs dive into why smoothies can actually be better than water for keeping you hydrated.

### What Makes Smoothies a Superior Hydration Option?

Smoothies combine water-rich fruits and vegetables, delivering hydration with added benefits. Here are a few key reasons why smoothies can outperform plain water:

- **Rich in Nutrients:** Smoothies are typically made with fruits and vegetables. This means you‚Äôre getting vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants along with hydration. Ingredients like spinach, kale, strawberries, and bananas can enhance your nutrient intake significantly.
- **Increased Electrolytes:** Many smoothie ingredients, such as bananas and coconut water, are rich in potassium and sodium. These electrolytes help you maintain fluid balance in your body, especially after exercise.
- **Better Taste Equals More Intake:** Many people struggle to drink enough water. Smoothies offer a tasty alternative that can encourage you to hydrate more frequently. Plus, you can experiment with flavors to discover your favorites.
- **Fiber Content:** Smoothies retain the fiber in fruits and veggies, which can aid in digestion and keep you feeling full longer. A hydrated body is also a healthier body, making the fiber in smoothies a wonderful addition.

### How to Make the Perfect Hydrating Smoothie

Creating a refreshing smoothie is easy! Here are some simple tips to craft the perfect blend:

1. **Choose Hydrating Ingredients:** Use water-rich fruits and vegetables like cucumbers, watermelon, oranges, and leafy greens.
2. **Add Healthy Fats:** Including a small amount of avocado or nut butter can make your smoothie creamy and satisfying.
3. **Provide a Liquid Base:** Instead of using plain water, consider coconut water or almond milk for added flavor and nutrients.
4. **Toss in Extras:** You can add chia seeds, flaxseeds, or protein powder to boost the nutritional profile even more.

- **Berry Blast:** Mix strawberries, blueberries, banana, and almond milk for a sweet treat.
- **Mango Tango:** Combine mango, peach, Greek yogurt, and a splash of orange juice.

### When to Choose a Smoothie Over Water

Smoothies can be especially beneficial in certain situations:

- **After Exercise:** They provide hydration and essential nutrients to help your body recover.
- **On Hot Days:** A smoothie can be more refreshing than water when you‚Äôre trying to cool down.
- **For Breakfast:** Replacing your morning coffee with a smoothie can kick-start your day with hydration and energy.

### Listening to Your Body

It‚Äôs important to listen to your body when it comes to hydration. While smoothies offer great benefits, don‚Äôt forget that water is still a vital component of your overall fluid intake. Balance is key! Smoothies can be a fun way to mix things up, but ensure you stay mindful of your hydration needs.

Smoothies into your hydration routine not only enhances your intake of vital nutrients but also offers a flavorful way to quench your thirst.

I've lost interest in video games, movies, the gym, and dating. There are weekends where I sit at my computer desk with a cup of coffee and blindly scroll youtube for most of the day. I will click a video just for some auditory stimulation, but that doesn't mean I am actually paying attention because the video will most likely not be of any value to me. I have lost a lot of motivation to really do anything meaningful. 

Hear me out, I am 30+ years old. I have college and military experience. I've worked 10 different jobs. I've met many people from different cultures and locations. I've had relationships and flings with other people. I'd like to think that I have *some* experience in life, yet I'm beginning to think that none of these experiences even matter. I've become numb to rules and expectations of everyday life. I used to care about what people thought of me, now I don't. When I look at a homeless person OD'ing on the street with fentanyl, I don't care if they die. I view my local city and state laws as just guidelines because no one gets in trouble for the petty stuff anyway. For example, driving around without a license plate or temporary tags. There are people out there doing this for years, and nothing is done about it. Perhaps these people share some of the same thoughts that I do?

I am currently attending college for the second time in my life, in hopes to get a job that will more than double my current pay. This will take 5 years. When I think of inflation, the federal reserve, and monetary policy, I often doubt that doubling my pay in 5 years will be worth it in the long run. I'm just going to get fucked by inflation, just like everyone else. We're all just competing for trivial stuff anyway, it really doesn't matter. 

  
When I want to make more money, I sign up for overtime at work, although I go into a higher tax bracket and money goes down the drain. When I want to get consistent in the gym again, I get injured (past military injuries flare up) and I stop going. What is the point of having any hobbies if they don't amount to anything? What kind of fucking place have I aged into? It feels like the laws of physics and the universe really don't like the way I am trying to improve my life. 

  
I attended therapy for military related PTSD a few years ago, but I feel like whatever I have going on in my head is slightly different. I think the way I feel is justified because there is no reward for hard work in my life. I don't believe the way I think about life is due to chemical imbalances. Life feels like I am doing things for absolutely no reason. I don't think this is depression. I am not sad about anything. I don't really have emotion towards anything like I used to. The only emotion I feel lately is anger towards people that cluster fuck around themselves, or people on the road.

 I am a fit, decently looking, tall white male just sitting in my apartment with my cat all weekend long. Something changed recently, and I don't know what it is.

A ginger bug is a naturally fermented culture used to make probiotic, naturally carbonated drinks like ginger ale, root beer, or fruit sodas. It is similar to a sourdough starter but is used for beverages. The process involves fermenting ginger, sugar, and water to create a mixture teeming with beneficial bacteria and wild yeasts.

How to Make a Ginger Bug

1. Ingredients:

Fresh ginger root (organic is best, to avoid pesticides that can inhibit fermentation)

Sugar (regular granulated sugar works well)

Water (non-chlorinated, as chlorine can kill the microorganisms)



2. Process:

Grate or finely chop 1-2 tablespoons of fresh ginger (leave the skin on if it's organic).

Combine the ginger with 1-2 tablespoons of sugar and 1-2 cups of water in a clean jar.

Stir well, cover loosely with a cloth or coffee filter, and secure with a rubber band to keep out debris but allow air circulation.

Each day for about 5-7 days, feed the bug with an additional tablespoon of grated ginger and sugar. Stir well each time.



3. Signs of Activity:

You'll notice bubbles forming, a slight fizz, and a pleasant, yeasty smell. These are signs the ginger bug is active and ready to use.




Using a Ginger Bug

Once your ginger bug is active, you can use it as a starter culture for fermenting sweetened liquids (like ginger tea or fruit juice) into fizzy, probiotic sodas. Reserve a portion of the bug to keep feeding and maintain the culture for future batches.

1hkwq8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/HSVpositive/comments/1hkwq8t/need_some_positive_support/,Need some positive support,"Hey community, 
It's Christmas Eve, I disclosed a day ago and it didn't go well and I really need some positive words! 
I'm 32 (f) and I really want a serious partner and kids. I had only had one partner that I had been with since I was 16 years old. He did something really really awful and I left. I hadn't been on dating apps, I never went on a date or spoke to another guy. The first guy I met off a dating app seemed ok. We spoke for ages, he was fun. He ended up coming back to mine and we had sex quite a few times. This was the second guy I have slept with. The last time he insisted on not using a condom and physically held me down while I was saying no and also physically forced me to perform oral. I have an autoimmune disorder and my symptoms have not been typical. I have hsv2 orally and genitally. If I'm on medication I don't get breakouts but I feel like it impacts my mental health and my hair, and I still have nerve pain everyday. Since getting this I haven't had a day without pain. without medication within a few days my throat becomes incredibly swollen and I get a cough that doesn't stop until I go back on medication, fever and headache. I get sores on the roof of my mouth that don't hurt much, just sting a bit when I eat and drink. Genitally I get extreme nerve pain and shooting pain down my legs. The genital sores are high up almost where my undies line sits and not very painful but the back and leg pain is close to unbearable. You can feel heat radiating from my back, inflammation in my whole body during an outbreak is extreme to the point I can't fit into most of my shoes or rings! On medication thankfully all of that is OK. Daily I have a slight pinch feeling in my lower back and slight feeling of a lump in my throat that has never gone away. I've tried going off medication a few times for 6 weeks and all times had 3 outbreaks (either genital, oral, genital or oral, genital, oral). The first 6 months I was diagnosed my immune system was terrible and I constantly got sick. After focusing so much on my health, I haven't had a flu at all in over a year. My main trigger is my period and ovulating so I have started taking 4-5 day medication  breaks at low risk times, starting medication when an outbreak is about to start and this has completely avoided outbreaks. In my 28 day cycle I'm now off medication about 10 days and really happy with this prigresss! It's been 2 years I've changed my diet, lost weight, been sent to many specialists who can see all the inflammation but can't help. I've had to increase medication for my autoimmune disorder for the first time in 15 years because it interacts with hsv. Most of my symptoms are autoimmune responses to the virus. The sores are the least severe symptom. I see a psychologist, meditate, do yoga.  I found out the guy has slept with a lot of women and had a really bad past. I insisted on getting tested for everything and got a cervical screen 11 months ago that I insisted on and paid for against medical advice when I wasn't due. It was positive for high risk hpv (not 16 or 18) with no cell changes. I'm being retested in a few weeks. I'm physically reasonably attractive, I'm fit, healthy, empathic, funny, have lots of hobbies, close friends, multiple uni degrees, I earn about 3 times the average and have a huge amount of savings but I feel like men see me as this diagnosis. I have tried dating normally off bumble and hinge. I personally try to be positive. I haven't slept with anyone in the past 2 years. I give myself a rule that I don't meet a guy before speaking for 2 weeks, have a day coffee or lunch date, I pay myself, I disclose after 2-3 dates and say I want to wait at least 3 months for sex but can do alternatives in the meantime when we are comfortable. I don't speak much about my experience but say I had complications due to other health conditions and it's been hard physically and emotionally. I give the stats on how common it is and 80% don't have symptoms. 3 guys have stayed just under 3 months after disclosing but when they saw an outbreak or saw me in pain they left. I've had 2 guys make fun of me and put me down and try to imply that without this they couldn't get a woman this hot but because of this I can't do better than him. Both still wanted sex and to date and I obviously rejected those 2.  Last night was my 6th disclosure. The guy just immediately apologised and said it's not a risk he would take. To be fair it's the first time I've been rejected at the point of disclosing but each guy that stayed has changed and left after another 5-10ish dates and told me it's only because of this.  2 other guys wanted sex immediately but put me down saying how such a hot, successful woman is actually ruined and at least I can't leave them or cheat on them as I won't do better and I left. I spent the last 5 months going on dates around once a week with different guys and I decided I didn't like any enough for this conversation and just paid for my coffee and politely let them know I wasn't interested. It feels so demotivating to go through 5 months of guys I don't like, find this guy i think is incredible, go on 3 dates, put in effort, have more dates set up and disclose and he leaves. I understand, I'd probably do the same and he was nice about it. It feels like things will never get better. Physically I still have symptoms daily even though I can see I'm making progress. However I spend a lot of my time and money on my health! I take a lot of vitamins that I feel have slightly helped. The 3 guys I've liked have all left and all said this is the only reason. I feel helpless. ",3,1734986002.0,HSVpositive,4,1.0,False

Ever have pangs of conscience about losing an eye or finger from a dumb stunt to impress your peers who turned out to be half-weathered flakes?

If you're like me you suffer from permanent gum recession and enamel erosion from cold, sweet, but acidic beverages like coffee and cola, then you're in luck.

My hatsu will restore the unregenerative parts of your body like your bones and nerves, effectively giving you a new lease on life.

You'll be able to re-enjoy that ice cream with your enamel restored and cavities filled without recoiling from now-forgotten tooth sensitivity.

You'll be able to walk your daughter down the aisle with your spine vertebrae restored, curing your paralysis.

I wanted to make life a little more forgiving in a bottom-up, non-hierarchal peer-to-peer way like ramen from a shaman.

Conditions

1. I have to get to know you and you know me. The deeper the bond, the more potent and encompassing the new lease will be.

2. I won't be able to give you another new lease on life. 

3. You and me will be in a state of Zetsu equivalent to the new lease's efficacy. The bigger the restoration, the bigger the Zetsu.",2,1734985935.0,HatsuVault,0,1.0,False

There's something you need to understand about us. INFJs are considered loners who can often be found wandering the park alone or drinking coffee by themselves at a cafe. However, don't assume we are lonely; we choose to isolate ourselves from the world in order to get in touch with our inner self and organize our thoughts. Sometimes I feel we were created to live life in our own minds.

Anyway, how are you finding it during this festivitive season full of hype by our brothers and sisters from the other personality womb? For me, I value my quiet time, privacy, walking everyday alone, away from everyone else. So during this Xmas, I have realized nothing will change, just like any other Xmas before. I'll be spending it alone, send some gifts to my parents and siblings home, and continue enjoying my me time. I wanted to visit nature places like Karura forest but just remembered it's xmass and people are now flocking there. So I'll spend time in my neighborhood, enjoy my normal evening walks, get lost in my own world, and life continues.

1hkwiyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hkwiyc/an_artists_journey_long_read_for_those_who_dare/,An Artists Journey (Long Read for Those Who Dare),"     I once had my English and Language Arts teacher, a twice published author, laugh at my efforts in her class. She berated me for my lack of comprehension in the finer skills of the English language. This woman made me, a child racked with the worst anxiety you could imagine, stand in front of my class and read a poem aloud to the class, only to openly scold me for it, grading it just high enough to be considered passing. This broke me. 

     I wanted to be a writer more than anything, though I had never told anyone before. This woman made it clear my dream was unobtainable. After finally moving on from her class I was so spite filled that I went to the store and purchased a dictionary. I stayed up for three days, running on a supply of coffee and cigarettes at the ripe young age of thirteen, and learned every word contained in this horribly out of date rendition of the Merriam-Webster.

     Despite my new found grasp of the English language, my fear of others seeking to ridicule my art as well as my talent persisted. I started what I now understand to be an awful habit, destruction of any creative outlet I used. In a calculated fashion I would burn my writings, erase my sketches, even delete my file once I finished a game. Any accomplishment I had, once completed, was immediately deemed unworthy of public eye. Years passed in which I never let anyone, even those closest to me, take a glance at my work. Something happened that changed this however.

     Have you ever met someone who was, for lack of a better word, just amazing? Someone whose energy brings something out in you that you didn‚Äôt know was there? A person who opens your eyes to a strange part of the world you thought you had known well? That is what happened to me. I was heartbroken, feeling abandoned by someone I believed would stand by me through Hel and high water, and lacking a better outlet for my pain I reached into this void we call Reddit and shared my pain through words.

     This was my very first dive into accepting the scrutiny of my work from others but, I was met with nothing but kind words and appreciation. A few hundred people had read my writing. I went from having never allowed another to view my work to allowing hundreds of other living beings to see it. This realization sent me into a panic and, despite the excitement I felt for the sudden outpouring support, I deleted the post.

     I had erased the only public trace of my work that had ever existed. The thing I did not realize, as I was new to this community, was that I had someone reach out to me before the post was deleted. One individual out of hundreds who reached out not to acknowledge my art, but to comfort my pain. Following many long, complex, and quite frankly beautiful conversations, she had shown me that my art, my soul, I myself was worthy of being seen. A feeling I never had before, a feeling I will never forget. 

     Due to the influence I gained through another‚Äôs perspective I began posting more of my content in these communities, once again receiving many kind words. I felt validated in the fact that I, a child who couldn‚Äôt read a full paragraph until middle school, was being appreciated for his literary works. This validation remains however, in the last few days I had seen the way that she had influenced my work. My words were no longer ones of pain, turmoil, or suffering. My words were filled with hope, optimism, love. I became terrified and once again deleted all of my works.

     Today I evaluated that decision and chose to start again, documenting stories from my life, letters to society, and words from my heart. In the end this letter is for you, the one who decided to click on my headline, the person who decided to read through my work, the one who made it to the end of this long and convoluted look into the inner workings featured inside the mind of a mad man. I thank you for taking time to examine the things I say and consider the meaning behind the words you see, and hopefully the ones in between that are hidden. Thank you again.

He was deathly afraid of us and yet he persisted in making our porch his home. Over the last summer he started to get a bit friendlier and we even built him this little house to help him get through the winter. However over the last month his health declined rapidly. He lost a ton of weight, his eyeholes got smaller and smaller, crustier and crustier. We could hear him trying to breath several yards away. As he declined he became totally docile, jumping up on my lap and purring as I pet him. He‚Äôd always greet me every morning when I came out to have my morning coffee.

1hkwfag,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_yessirnasser/comments/1hkwfag/beauty_a_perspective_beyond_skin_deep/,Beauty: A Perspective Beyond Skin Deep,"Hi Reddit,

I wanted to share some personal thoughts about beauty‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve thought a lot about as a person and as the founder of a skincare brand.

For most of us, beauty is often tied to appearance, but I‚Äôve come to realize it‚Äôs so much more than that. Beauty is something we experience with all five senses: sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned about beauty over the years:

# It‚Äôs More Than What Meets the Eye

Sight is usually the first sense to recognize beauty, and that‚Äôs okay. But being ‚Äúvisually beautiful‚Äù isn‚Äôt just about the products you use‚Äîit‚Äôs about your mindset.

People are more beautiful when they radiate positivity, notice beauty in others, and appreciate their surroundings. Beauty is as much about the energy you give off as it is about what others see.

# Beauty Is an Experience

True beauty isn‚Äôt limited to sight; it‚Äôs something we feel through all five senses:

* **Touch**: A warm hug from someone you love.
* **Hearing**: The sound of your child saying, ‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù
* **Smell**: Fresh coffee at your favorite caf√©.
* **Taste**: A meal that makes your day brighter.

When you start to notice beauty in these moments, it transforms how you see yourself and the world.

# My Personal Journey with Beauty and Skincare

Like many of you, I‚Äôve struggled to feel good about myself at times. Life gets stressful‚Äîwe‚Äôre all juggling surviving, thriving, failing, succeeding, and trying to stay ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù through it all.

For me, the one thing that‚Äôs helped clear my mind and reconnect with myself has been taking care of my skin. Building a small, simple skincare routine became a way to pause and care for myself.

It wasn‚Äôt always easy. It took years of trial and error‚Äîtrying products and routines that didn‚Äôt work. Eventually, I created something that did: a product I call A.Oil.

# What A.Oil Means to Me

Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs special to me:

* Every time I see the bottle, it makes me smile.
* When I smell it, I feel grounded.
* When I rub it into my skin‚Äîon my face, arms, legs, and hands‚ÄîI feel like I‚Äôve done something good for myself.

It‚Äôs simple, natural, and it‚Äôs become a product I know I‚Äôll cherish for the rest of my life. It‚Äôs something I look forward to sharing with my future family and kids.

# Why I‚Äôm Sharing This

I‚Äôm sharing this because I want others to feel what I‚Äôve felt. That‚Äôs why, for this holiday season, my team and I are offering A.Oil at cost.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown:

* $21 to make it.
* $10 to ship it.
* $10 in gifts for the holidays.

Normally, it‚Äôs priced at $58, but for the holidays, you can try it for $41. Use the code **HOLIDAYS** at checkout if you‚Äôre interested: [https://vowelskin.com](https://vowelskin.com).

# Let‚Äôs Connect

If you have thoughts, questions, or even want to chat about your own skincare journey, feel free to drop a comment or reach out to me at [**support@vowelskin.com**]().

Thanks for taking the time to read this‚ÄîI hope it inspires you to see beauty in more places, including yourself.  
  
Happy Holidays!   
**With Love,**

This will be a long one. And He's the only relationship I was in. That's why i really don't know am I really in the wrong or right. My English is not perfect. I'm a little bit drunk while writing this. 

Infos:
Me(F24) and My ex-fianc√©(M24) had been togather since we were 19. But we know eachother longer than that. We were in a same group in Highschool. I am currently pursuing my PHD and he also has a Master degree and currently working in a advertising. We instantly clicked as soon as we met. But we are both goal oriented people and kinda ""rivals"" in our highschool years so we didn't date back then. We reconnected after I came back home from College and then we started dating. 

We did a LDRS while i was pursuing a bachelor degree for 2 years. And then I moved back to do Master degree with him. And I own a small business which is doing fine. 

I am from a political refugee family. My parents are activists from SEA. We emigrated from our country when I was 15 to a different country. And then to US when I was 16 going 17. I already have a green card caus We are government protected defectors. I am fully SEA but I looks east asian(this will become important i guess). So people always confuse me with Chinese, Korean or Japanese.


Main Event:
This ""Small Misunderstanding"" Happened when we were freshly engaged. 

He's the main talent of his department in the advertising firm he work with. He usually have to work with models and influencers. I am not a jealous person so i don't normally get jealous of him. He also have to work late nights which I also understand. And sometimes the project he's handling with is big or when he's in a Zone he forgot to call me or message me. And also I understand that cause I also do that sometimes. We are both passionate in our work and that's the same facts that made us closer. 

After we got engaged his firm got offered from a pretty big brand to do a Campaign with them for 4 months. As soon as he got that offer his behaviour changed. At first I didn't think much of it. Later i found out he had to work with his role model editor togather. That role model is a woman(F35). Of course i also didn't feel jealous at the moment cuz he literally worked with the most gorgeous models and influencers and nothing happened. 

A month into that project he's been working late hous and didn't answer my phone for the whole day. Not even a message. Normally that kinda things happened when the deadline is so close or it only happened for 3 days. But this time it happened for over a month. So I tried to talk to hime about that and he blew up at first and we had a fight and an hour later we make up and he let me search his phone. 

I found nothing that indicates cheating but i found his role model texting him things like "" your girlfriend looks like Korean. You like kpop. That must be why you are with her."". He never defended me on the message.She never acknowledged me as his fianc√©e and he never corrected her. We talked more about it. The reason for not defending me is that she is his role model that is why he doesn't want to be on her bad side. He assured me that his role model doesn't see in that way and She is too old for him. He promised in the future he will defend me more and respond to my messages more. So we ended the conversation in a good note. 

2 weeks after that fight their firm had a party which people can take +1 to and he didn't tell me about it at first. But later i know about it from a mutual friend(his colleague's girlfriend) and we had a fight again. He didn't want me as a +1 cuz he thought me and his role model would me awkward. In the end we decided to go together. At that party i had a emergency error at my small business i had to check asap and i left the party early. The emergency didn't last long and i drove back to the party cuz he didn't have a designated driver. When I arrived at the party people said he already left with his role model. And his colleague's girlfriend show me a video of the role model trying to kiss him, he didn't have a time to move away and they kissed for 15sec i think. And the role model seemed pretty drunk in that video. And she's sprouting ""You should leave you gf. I can give you so much opportunities. ur gf is just a kpop lookalike girl. Once you older you will grew tired of her. I bet she's after your green card."". I felt really hurt that he didn't defended me like he promised. How can he let some person he met for 3 months talk to me like that. 

I rushed home and waited for him but he didn't come back until 3am.( I left the party at 11:30). As soon as he get in i searched his phone and asked him a bunch of questions. Like ""where have you been? Why do you come home this late. Etc"". He looked me with surprised and hurted eyes and started crying. He said he've never seen me so hateful towards him. He just took his role model home and other people joined on their uber. That is why the trip home took so long. And he even show his uber app to confirm that. All of that match. 

And he started accusing me of not believing him. And me being insecure is making our relationship fail and other stuff. I really really love him so much and see him crying like that make me speechless. It also make me hurt so i didn't bring up the fact that i saw the video of them kissing and decided to give him another chance. 

After that we had a pretty stress-free period. His project finished and he requested his supervisor to step in for him when he have to talk with his role model. He also replied my message regularly. I really thought that was it and we will be marrying when i finished my PHD. 

About 2 months after his project. I was having a coffee with his colleague's girlfriend and she brings up the fact about us moving. She was asking me things like "" will you two decide to marry first or moving to your new house first?/ Is he done packing up?/ Are you going with him and do your PHD online?"" I was so confused and asked her what was she talking about and i found out he's planing to move to LA. I thought that was a misunderstanding between her bf and my fianc√©. 

I asked him when I got home and she was right. He is planning to move without telling me. He got a job offer from a firm in LA. I freaked out and started asking him. Why don't you tell me. And he said he don't have a confidence to do LDRS with me because my insecurities can't maintain the relationship. So I asked him "" Are you Breaking up with me?"". He even got more mad that I am jumping onto conclusions. We had a heated argument and i can't think of any other solutions. What did he want? He didn't want to break up at the same time he didn't want to do the LDRS with me and don't want me to move together with him. The worst thing is that even his coworkers, childhood friends, his family, all knew about him moving and I am the only one who didn't know. He got his Job offer about 1 month and a half so most of them know about it at least a week. 

After the fight I took off my engagement ring and went for a ride. When I came back he's asleep. I took my most essential items and left that night and crushed at my Wearhouse. So many thoughts were on my mind. How do I tell my parents that I broke up with him?. They are not conservative but they are Asian parents. They must be so ashamed of me for breaking off the engagement. And all of that my fault? The fact that he didn't defend me and my culture. So many thoughts. I can't go back to my parents' house yet so i waited for him in my Wearhouse for a week. He didn't show up. Didn't even call me. At that time I realized that was it and go back to my parents' house.


After that I blocked him on everything. My parents are surprisingly chill about all the things. I postponed my PHD and moved to new city. It's been a year since we broke up. Sometimes i stalk him from other accounts. But i didn't sent anything. I still have feelings for him but after thinking about it i am not sure i want to be with him again. 

This Dec i went back home to celebrate Christmas with my parents and he showed up at my house. My parents let him in and told me i should listen to his side of the story.
He explained me that nothing really happened between him and his role model. He showed me the texts and he didn't go to LA because he doesn't want to give us up. He said all the things that happened between us were just ""small misunderstanding"". He was so emotional and worked up with the new project that is why he lashed out. And he apologised.
But the thing is...i think i still have feelings but i already moved on. I'm not seeing anyone cuz i am not ready for relationship again. He apologised but he kept saying like I am the one who broke things off and holding a grudge over culture shocks of his role model. I mean.. i guess. But.. what did he want to do At that time? He didn't want to do LDRS, he already accepted the job offer, he already told everyone abt it except me, he didn't want me to move with him. 

And he's not apologising for telling me that i am the one jumping to conclusions while he was.the one insinuating to break up.What did he want me to do? He's acting like I am the reason we broke up. This is so infuriating for me.

I don't have bad feelings about him. I know things happen but i don't want to take him back.
Now my family and my friends and telling me to give him another chance. He is coming to my house daily. Even planning to celebrate Christmas with my family. Would I be the AH if I don't take him back.
