Some important people were coming to Chapel Hill to meet with me, so I picked the spot. I chose WF. What a mistake. There was no coffee.

I let her know that for years, I have been going out of my way to grab a coffee at WF. Unflinching, she responded, ""Yep, well, you can get a coffee after 11."" 

This feels like country club-level complaining, but at the same time, they've stopped selling their overpriced breakfast burritos/tacos and other hot bar breakfast things, their sandwich operations are non-existent during lunch times, their pizza has gone completely downhill, their sushi is now $18, and they're consistently out of stock on typical green produce. I have always been a WF fanboy and have spent tens of thousands of dollars with the brand over the years, but holy shit, have they disappointed me and my expectations over the past several months.

I had been working tirelessly for months, pouring my heart and soul into my business. As a young entrepreneur, I had always dreamed of making a name for myself and achieving financial success.
I had started my company, a small marketing firm, just a year ago with a handful of clients and a lot of determination. I had spent countless hours networking, pitching, and hustling to grow my business. And it was finally starting to pay off:
As I sipped my coffee and checked my email, I saw a notification from my accountant. My heart skipped a beat as I opened the message and saw the words ""Congratulations, you've reached a milestone!"" My eyes widened as I read on, and my jaw dropped when I saw the number: $100,000.
I couldn't believe it. I had done it. I had made my first $100,000. Tears of joy and relief welled up in my eyes as I thought about all the hard work and sacrifices I had made to get to this point.
I immediately called my best friend and business partner, Rachel, to share the news.
She
screamed with excitement
on the other end of the line, and we both burst out laughing. we had been through so much together, and this moment was a testament to our dedication and perseverance.
I spent the rest of the day in a daze, feeling like I was walking on cloud nine. I took a walk outside, enjoying the sunshine and the feeling of accomplishment that came with it. I thought about all the people who had supported me on my journey, from my family to my mentors, and I felt grateful for their love and encouragement.
As the day went on, I started to think about what this milestone meant for my business. It meant that I could finally take a breath and enjoy the fruits of my labor. It meant that I could invest in new projects and hire more staff to help me grow. It meant that I could finally start to build a life outside of my business, one that included travel, hobbies, and time with loved ones.
That evening, I celebrated with Rachel and a few close friends at a fancy restaunant raised a glass.of champagne and toasted to my success. As I looked around the table, I knew that this was just the beginning. I had worked hard to get to this point, but I was ready for the next challenge.
The feeling of making my first $100,000 was indescribable. It was a mix of emotions - excitement, relief, gratitude, and pride. It was a reminder that all the hard work and sacrifices had paid off, and that I was capable of achieving anything I set my mind to.
As - looked back on that moment, I knew that it was a turning point in my life. It was a reminder that success is not just about the money, but about the journey, the people you meet, and the lessons you learn along the way. And it was a reminder that with determination, hard work, and a bit of luck, anything is possible.",1,1738865166.0,u_IcyMasterpiece8501,0,1.0,False

It's a moral dilemma to buy other companies' presses as they're copying aeropress?
Then answer me this. Out of all the equipment that you use, how many of them belong to the company/person who actually invented them? Your moka pot? your french press? your grinder??
When asked about recommendations for these equipments, these purists will list out top 3 companies which they love, yet when someone asks about kaldipress, suddenly its a moral dilemma. why?

Now the concerns about plastic quality are still valid. Though there is a lot of pseudoscience going around in this sub regarding that too. 
Pouring hot water in plastic (even bpa free plastic) does result in accelerated leaching of chemicals into the liquid. 
Notice the word ""accelerated""? Yeah news flash. these chemicals still leach in cold water, albeit much more slowly. So that water you drink from bisleri bottles packaged 6 months ago is gonna have way more chemicals into it.
Oh and have you ever drunk hot tea or coffee from disposable cups? they're lined by an extremely thin layer of PLASTIC yet we show no hesitations in drinking from them. 
So no. the amount of plastic chemical leaching from keeping hot water for 2-5 minutes in a kaldipress is not going to significantly harm you even if you drink coffee from it 10 times in a day (atleast in your lifetime)
If you want to avoid plastics, avoid using ALL plastics and then maybe you'll see a health benefit, if any at all.

Not everyone has the money to buy expensive equipment.

I would love to have your impressions or thoughts on my story.

I am in my 40s and he's 50. I met him on a dating app, however I was not in his country and just ""exploring"" the dating field there.

I had not been dating for a few years, since my last relationship with an avoidant man traumatised me. I have been working on myself since then. And being on my guard.

So in December, this guy matches with me and comes on really strong, his first message was jokingly asking me to be his last girlfriend. I explained I was just exploring and changed my location out of curiosity. He nevertheless kept messaging me showing a lot of interest in me.I made it clear I only wanted a relationship and he asked me if in the eventuality we would be right for each other if I would move to his country. I responded that was a possibility but would take time to get there.

He is a single dad of 2 teens and was never married. He has had a series of relationships since he separated from their mother, between 1 to 3 years each. We both had a relationship with an avoidant partner, but when I discovered his last attempt with his ex was a few months ago last summer, I felt turned off and told him he was not ready. He insisted and convinced me he already had rebounds and that he wanted someone that would make him happy and not miserable like the avoidant ex.

He said he wanted to come visit me in France soon, he is in Denmark. In the meantime, since we had so much time to get to know one another, I asked questions about what he wanted, his personality type etc. He said he also has an anxious preoccupied attachment style, like me, and tended to be too ""dependent"" in the past. I asked if he has had therapy. There were a few clashes after I expressed that I don't want a partner with female friends, meeting one on one.

This came up after he tried to bring the conversation to more sexual topic and I denied it, to which he responded his female friends talk about everything. This made me uncomfortable and I wondered if he was a player. He also said he had a lot of needs for closeness. After lots of arguing and proving his point, I felt turned off by the tug of war, but he agreed he would respect my preference if we were in a relationship.

We started having long phone calls and got to know each other more for many weeks. He was very invested daily, either call or texting. Very sweet and thoughtful. He booked his ticket to fly to Paris and a hotel.

Finally he came visit last week, for 5 days. We were both nervous to meet. The connection felt so good on the phone that I was afraid everything would be different if the chemistry was not there in person.

  
The first coffee date was lovely and he rapidly kissed me. I felt attracted to him too. He took me on nice dinner dates and it felt good. We became physically intimate. Maybe that was too fast.

There was a weird moment when I realised I don't know his name so I asked him. He was tired in bed and he started joking about being Mr Tired something for a few minutes, I felt suspicious. After that he said he said his name but I kept feeling triggered and asked for his passport (I know that sounds extreme). He wanted to sleep and not talk. I turned the lights back on and he said he didn't want to give it to me because he was afraid I would stalk him online.

This made me upset and outraged, I confronted the fact that despite we had had sex he was no longer talking about being girlfriend / boyfriend. He said we were dating and not a couple yet. I said I was not on trial period and he must have had bad intentions towards me if he was suspicious about giving me his full name. It became messy and I told him to go back to his hotel.

The next day, he texted me he wanted to see me and talk. I agreed and we met. He said he should not have said that. BUT also felt like I crossed his boundaries and he let it slide (with the opposite sex friends). He said I was unreasonable. I responded that my feelings were valid and part of me, so if he invalided my feelings, instead of finding a resolution, it was a judgment and not helpful for the relationship. I have felt like he is very stubborn and wants to win the argument and can't see my point of view. As if he lacks empathy. And he said he felt criticised by me. Which is true.

We fell back into each other's arms. We spent the last days holding hands, having great sex, going out and he treated me well. I was affectionate and sweet, maybe too much. On the last day, he suggested I would visit him in Copenhagen. I agreed.

The same night, back home, we texted briefly but I felt immediately a shift in the communication. No goodnight text no call. I felt like it's ok maybe he needs to process his feelings after being close and meeting the real me. The following day, I only received a text in the evening ""How was your day""; I responded and he took more than 40 minutes to say he was glad to hear that. I asked about his day. NO response. The following morning still nothing. He left me on read. This was never the case before.

He texted at night an emoji üòò. No explanation as to why he left me on read the previous day. No phone call anymore, I decided to ignore that low effort communication.

So now it is 3 days he has left and I feel like I have lost the sweet guy he was before. The communication has changed. It feels like breadcrumbs. I don't feel like chasing, I feel betrayed and disappointed. Is he another avoidant man? A player that got what he wanted?

Any thoughts or advice are welcome! Thank you for reading me.

1ij8v6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ij8v6r/where_is_everyone/,Where is Everyone?,"Where is everyone???

I woke up one day and everyone, absolutely everyone, was - or is, gone. The internet is up, cable is running, electricity and water is still working, yet there's no one around and I can't get into contact with anyone. No one answers when I call on the phone, and although I can see the messages I've uploaded to social media, I see nothing from anyone else, just old posts and comments from the day before this happened that don't change when I refresh.  It's like time has been frozen, and all the animals, humans, and even bugs have been taken out of Earth. 

My name is - Oh, who the hell cares? Who is gonna see this anyway? This is the only way to keep from going insane, uploading detailed accounts of whatever's happening to me even though I have no idea if anyone can see it. If they can see it, then the  responses are invisible to me, because I've tried sending SOS messages to family, friends, and even strangers. 

Nothing big or unexpected happened before that day a few months ago. I'm a regular girl, working part time in the city and sitting through college lectures when I'm not manning the counter of my local coffee shop. I live - or, lived - with my parents and sister who's still in high school, since I couldn't afford to make it on my own yet. I had just come back from a late night shift, working overtime from open to close since someone called out at the last minute, and I took an Uber back home. I used my spare key to get in the house, ate leftovers from dinner, took a hot shower, and climbed into bed. 

I had no dreams or weird visions or anything. I woke up to the sunlight coming through my window blinds. I looked at the time on my phone and realized I had overslept. When I went downstairs, I heard nothing but the TV playing an early morning show my mom loved to watch after dropping my sister off at school. Dad's absence could be explained by him going to work, but my mom's was weird. I looked around for her but when I didn't find her, I didn't freak out. Not until I went outside, but I didn't do that until an hour had passed of me eating breakfast and thinking about the classes I‚Äôd missed the day before and that morning. 

I went out to catch a bus since it seemed Uber couldn't find a ride, and that's when I saw that my parents‚Äô cars were still in the driveway. Maybe my sister went to school on the bus for once, that was plausible, but what wasn't was my dad going to work without his car and my mom running an errand without hers. I remember looking into the windows of their vehicles, seeing nothing amiss, and trying their cell phones. It rang and rang and ended with their voicemails. 

I don't think I realized how completely dead the neighborhood was until I walked to the nearest bus stop. Children's bikes were abandoned on the sidewalk, cars that would usually be gone during that time of day because the neighbors worked morning shifts like my dad were present in the garages. There was no sign of life anywhere, no birdsong, no butterflies or bees despite the weather conditions being perfect for them. Everything was so quiet, like an empty graveyard. I felt like something was deeply, deeply wrong, but I tried not to think about it as I waited for the bus.

The bus did not come after an hour, and traffic was strangely at a standstill. I began walking, travelling further into the city, and that's when I started to grow more concerned by the second. The city was just as dead as the neighborhood. The bus I had been waiting on was parked at a stop on a busy street, with no driver and no passengers. The wind blew grocery bags like they were tumbleweeds across the road, and the buildings, while all lit up from the inside, contained no people. No employees, no customers, you get the gist. At that point, I would've been overjoyed just to see a squirrel climb up a tree. 

I reacted just as anyone would. I panicked, and I mean panicked hard. I had an utter meltdown in the middle of broad street, hyperventilating and curling into a ball, soaked in my own sweat. There was no one around to help me, to call an ambulance or even ask if I was alright. It was maddening, and it wasn't even midday yet. I walked all the way to my job, found the cafe open but vacant, and then walked to my college campus, which of course yielded the same results. I sat down in the lecture hall, frantically googling anything on my phone that may relate to what was happening. All I could think was that the entire city had evacuated, and I was somehow left behind, or something like that‚Ä¶ 

No news had been posted since yesterday on every website I checked. When I tried to refresh browser pages, the tabs would turn blank, and then an error message would appear. I went back home, which took at least three hours of walking, with sores developing on my feet, and got into my dad's car after finding his keys on the key tray in the hallway- a detail I hadn't noticed before. I was crying as I drove around the city, going around cars that were randomly stopped on the street. I drove past the city border, into the next town, which was exactly the same, so I drove to the next town after that one. During my impromptu road trip, I passed by unoccupied airports, the planes all there since clearly there were no flights taking off. 
 
The numbers I kept calling and texting were my family and friends‚Äô and the police. I didn't know what else to do. Eventually I pulled over to the side of the road and sobbed and screamed in frustration, rocking in the driver's seat with my knees pulled up to my chest. I cried until I had no more tears left to shed, and my face was redder than a tomato with snot pouring out my nose like a faucet. This had to be a bad dream, I'd thought. Or some kind of super elaborate hoax of which I was the sole victim. 

Day in and day out, I focused on adapting until I came across someone, and keeping myself sane by watching old YouTube videos and saved Instagram reels. I didn't dare go back home, the lack of the sound of my sister's rude jokes at my expense, my dad's laughter at some stupid sitcom, and my mother's cooking only served to give me a deep depression during which I never left my room so I couldn't be reminded of how alone I was. Instead, I decided to try and make the most of this fucked up situation by travelling, since the world was still functioning, just without the people who made it that way. 

That's something I thought about a lot. As the weeks passed, I was so scared that the lights would shut off permanently and the water would stop running, so scared in fact, that it made me want to vomit and pass out. But that never happened, even reruns of TV shows still broadcasted when I turned on any TV. It was‚Ä¶really fucking weird. I mean, really really weird. Who was keeping the electrical paid, who was tending to the plumbing, who was broadcasting television and keeping WiFi servers up? The only catch was that I couldn't see anything new that was uploaded past the day I realized I was alone, meaning no recent news, no live shows, nothing. 

I tried not to think about this too hard, because to be honest, even though I was glad I could still flush toilets after I used them and turn on lights in dark rooms, the thought unsettled me. It made me feel like I was the center of the universe's cruelest practical joke, but I knew a prank of this magnitude was simply impossible. 

Unless‚Ä¶ unless my brain was undergoing some high-tech simulator while my body was in the real world, making me think this was reality when it's actually a program designed as some mentally scarring experiment to see how a human would react when placed in this situation. At least, if that was the case, there was hope of me waking up and returning to normal society, but again, nothing happened the day before all this, I didn't consent to any experiment or scientific testing. And why would these hypothetical government agents or scientists choose me of all people? 

After the first two months, I began to‚Ä¶enjoy myself, a bit. Not too much, but a reasonable amount I‚Äôd like to think. I know it probably sounds crazy from your end, but if I kept making theories and freaking out about seemingly being the only person on the planet, or at least on the continent, then I would go insane. The hecticness of daily life is something we can all relate to, feeling like a cog in the machine and wondering if life is just one trial of survival after another. You might have thought to yourself, am I just gonna work nonstop until I die? Who am I? Why am I doing this? When can I just enjoy life and take it easy without worrying about the future, or bills? 

Well, when I realized that the upside to humanity being erased (hopefully temporarily) was no rules and responsibilities, I looked at things with a fresher perspective. I would keep travelling until I found someone like me of course (which was making me lose more hope each day, as I'd gone through a few states by this time), but I would at least take a moment to enjoy the peaceful solitude on the way. I've taken the best naps of my life in fields full of wildflowers, went skinny dipping in hot springs, and even went into a restaurant, thawed out the food from the walk-in fridge, and used their kitchen to cook myself gourmet meals to the best of my abilities. 

So many cars had keys in them, like they were all just sitting there for me to take a joyride in. I did donuts in parking lots, I went into Walmarts and stole video game consoles on which I played offline games on, and I slept in mansions and the best suites of any five star hotel. Every door was unlocked, making it unbelievably easy to go anywhere and do anything. One rich person's apartment I crashed in was in a high rise, and I had an amazing time swimming in a pool on their balcony, which you could see the city miles down below through the glass floor. 

I always had to have noise playing wherever I went. I kept one earphone in (in case I heard someone) and listened to music, and I always kept a TV on wherever I stayed. It replaced live human voices for me, it became white noise. I turned my tragedy into serenity, and though I still craved company, at least I could have a decent time until I found help, or woke up, or a scientist pulled the chords connecting my brain to the simulator or something.

That feeling of freedom and carelessness didn't last long, though.  

The third month came, and I was driving through the midwestern region of the country in an RV I'd stolen so I could experience van life like those influencers but without the risk and the money. I was going to the east coast because I wanted to stay in a beach house. My cousin liked renting them in Virginia, Florida, and the two Carolinas, and I‚Äôd always wanted to experience them. Of course, Autumn had come and winter was starting (or should've been at least), but it was still warm enough for a dip in the sea. Global warming, I guess. 

Anyways, night came and I stopped in some random city, choosing an upscale hotel to stay in. Highest floor, biggest room, and a hoard of food from the kitchen, all to myself. I slept like a baby, listening to a podcast, with the flat screen TV playing some reality show. The lights always stayed on, and in this case, it was two bright table lamps, one on each side of the king sized bed, and a standing lamp in the corner. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to complete darkness and utter silence. The TV was off, so were all the lights. The curtain was drawn over the glass wall which showed a beautiful view of the city, when I was sure I had left them open to look at the dazzling lights of the skyscrapers. 

Instantly, I sat up and started breathing heavily, knowing in my heart that my good time was over because the electricity was now gone. I figured I may as well just go back to sleep until daybreak, and then go and steal flashlights from the nearest store for the next night or something, but I wanted to open the curtains first. I guess I must've forgotten that I closed them‚Ä¶ I pulled them aside, and my heart skipped a beat as I noticed something. 

The buildings in the city were still lit up. The energy still worked. I scrambled in the dark, pressing the power button on the bedside lamp. Nothing happened, so I felt for the chord, which had been unplugged. I plugged it back in and the lamp turned on, glowing a soft yellow. Upon a quick investigation, I realized all the lamps had been unplugged, and the remote to the TV was perched on the dresser across from my bed, even though I fell asleep with it on my nightstand. 

Then it hit me, all at once. It felt like the breath had been knocked from my lungs, and I immediately started to tremble. 

Someone had been in this room, while I was asleep. 

And while that should've made me excited to discover another human, it terrified me instead. Because whoever it was decided to fuck with me and leave me in complete darkness, rather than rejoice in the fact they had found another survivor. And if they would truly choose to scare me like this even though I could very well be the only other human left on earth, what type of person were they? Had they gone insane? Were they dangerous? Or was this simply proof that all of this was a hoax and they were now messing with me because I had started to make the best of my situation and that was too boring for the cameras? 

I honestly hoped to God the last part was the answer, because while that would be the meanest hoax ever conceived, at least the nightmare would be over. But not so deep down, I knew the prank theory was utterly stupid, and wrong. I mean, even if it was possible, no prank would go on this long. I just wanted to believe that over my terrifying reality. 

After I turned the lights and TV back on, I noticed the door was open, showing the dark hallway. Now, I'm not the strongest or the bravest, but I knew I had to do something, I couldn't just go back to sleep. I gathered some stuff and used the light of my phone to navigate my way through the now dark hotel building, turning on the lights as I went. 

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I called out. ‚ÄúIs anyone there?‚Äù

When I got to the kitchen, I took a big carving knife with me, just in case. The dead silence unnerved me to absolutely no end. I searched every room, using keys from the office behind the lobby. It took a while, looking inside closets and bathrooms, but eventually I was able to confidently say that whoever unplugged the lamps in my suite was no longer in the building. I didn't know how to feel about any of it. Half of me wanted to be happy to the point of tears that someone was in this with me, but the other half just knew this wasn't good news at all.

I trusted my gut and decided to leave. 

I got in the RV and drove until daybreak, putting as much distance between me and that place as possible. I became exhausted and parked in the most crowded parking lot I could find, so I'd be hard to spot, then fell asleep. When I woke up in the middle of the afternoon, I started a regular day, trying to put the previous night past me. I toured this city I‚Äôd never been to before and browsed a selection of name brand clothes like Gucci and Prada that I would normally never be able to wear as a broke college student. I looked like a celebrity or some fashion model as I explored, looking for any sign of life. One of the things I missed the most was animals, like seeing someone walk their dog or watching a cat nap in a windowsill. 

When I returned to the RV at sundown, I was met with a disturbing sight. The door to the RV was wide open, and almost everything was out of place. The covers on the bed were strewn on the floor, alongside my clothes and the food and items I'd stolen from stores either for survival or pleasure. The cupboards were open, the faucets were left running, including the tub. And worst of all, someone doodled a smiley face in the dust of one of the RV windows. Two long vertical lines for the eyes and a curve under them for the mouth. This simple picture put so much fear in me I felt like the world was collapsing. 

Once again, someone had intruded in on my space, and deliberately left a sign that they had been there. More than one person had to be fucking with me, because how did the person from the hotel know where I was? How would they have found me so quickly? There are a million places I could be at, there was just absolutely no way they knew I'd be in this one city in this one parking lot. If there was more than one person, then why were they doing this? What did they want? Why don't they just come up to me and talk like a normal human being, so we can figure this shit out together? 

I think that's when paranoia first hit me. Sometimes I don't think I'm paranoid, and sometimes I do. I don't fucking know, okay?! I feel like I'm going crazy. 

Well, that's when I first started having irrational thoughts like, *Who says it's a human to begin with?* And *If it is a human, who says they want to figure anything out? Maybe they know more than you do about why the world is like this, and they know it's unfixable, so they're deciding to have their sick fun with you because, let's face it, who's around to stop them?*

The human brain can be so intelligent, but also so masochistic. Mine was torturing me with all these thoughts until I felt like I couldn't breathe. I decided to pack a bag of the stuff I've hoarded since day one and abandon the RV. I can't count how many times I looked over my shoulder as I left to find another car, I felt watched. 

Once again, I found a vehicle parked with the doors unlocked, small and black which is definitely more inconspicuous than a hulking RV. The keys were, as usual, inside, and once I got to driving away from that city, it felt like I had a breath of fresh air. However, I wasn't going to keep that car for long, because if whoever did that was around to see me get into it, I didn't want them to be able to recognize the car in whatever place I went next. This time, I stayed on the road all day, only stopping to relieve myself at a convenience store and get gas. I tried to appreciate the sights I drove past, but I couldn't stop thinking about the Stranger, which is what I had decided to call him or her. 

It wasn't long then until I would reach the east coast, but night came and I had to sleep. I didn't want to give up comfort just yet, but I was also extremely nervous that I had been followed, although I saw no other cars driving on the road. Instead of sleeping in upscale hotels, I decided to change things up a bit, so I wouldn't be as predictable to the Stranger. I considered sleeping in a crappy, rundown motel, but I wanted to be absolutely sure they wouldn't know my next move. 

I parked miles away from my destination, and using Google Maps which thankfully was still functioning normally, I walked there using back alleys. The sliver of rationality remaining in my brain told me that there's no way they were in that small town without me seeing them following me in a vehicle, but I was taking no chances. I found a big grocery store, took the keys out of a random car in the parking lot that I was gonna use the next morning, and decided to gather some covers from the domestic section and crash in one of the back offices of some manager. I locked the door,  made a pad on the floor, and turned out the light. I ate a dinner of chips and candy, rather than microwaving or cooking something that would release a smell which would indicate my location. 

It was hard getting to sleep, but I managed, trying to quietly listen to ambience soundtracks on YouTube with a Bluetooth earphone stuffed in my ear. Sleep snuck on me really, I didn't even feel myself drifting off, I was bone tired, but confident that I left no tracks and was going to be safe. 

I woke up to music, but nothing was playing on my phone. 

In fact, my phone had died, and the screen was black. 

No, the music was coming from the overhead speakers. An old tune from the 40‚Äôs or 50‚Äôs, one I faintly recognized but wasn't exactly too familiar with. 

‚ÄòWe'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when-‚Äô

Someone was playing this over the intercom, and it blared throughout the entire store at an almost deafening volume. I sat there on the floor swaddled in covers, shaking so hard I could barely grip my phone as I wondered if it was even safe to leave that cramped little office. That's when I figured I should've tried to find a security room to crash in, as I'd seen cameras installed on the way in earlier. Maybe I could've spotted whoever this was on the footage, but now it was too late. 

I made double sure the door was locked and then plugged my phone up to the outlet in the corner so I could at least see the time. I tried to remain as quiet as possible, in case the Stranger was still there. When I powered my phone on, I realized it was 4AM, and I decided I would not try to leave until sunrise, which should've been in a couple of hours. I just had to sit and wait until then. 

After the song ended, I heard something else play over the intercom. Someone was simply breathing into the microphone. Soft and subtle, but definitely there. The Stranger was still there, and I had no idea how they could've possibly found me. I even checked my phone to make sure my location wasn't turned on anywhere, and went through all my stuff thoroughly to be sure there wasn't some kind of airtag or tracker attached to my clothes or something. My search came up empty. 

I stayed in that back office for most of the day rather than leaving at sunrise, like a sitting duck. I was too scared to leave. Hours passed of hearing nothing, no music and no breathing, but still, I didn't dare move an inch from where I sat on the floor. I was hungry and thirsty. I felt like a child hiding under the covers from a monster in their closet, I felt foolish. Finally, I checked my phone and saw that it was evening time. I had to make a move. 

I looked for anything I could use as a weapon first, and all I found was a pen with a particularly sharp tip. I supposed I could stab someone in the neck with it. My backpack on my back, I crept out the door, and realized that once again, the lights had been turned out on me. Why? Was whoever was stalking me trying to make it easier to get the jump on me? 

I removed my shoes so that my footsteps were quiet, my socks padding on the linoleum floor. The only illumination I had was the street lamps outside streaming white, almost ghostly looking light through the big front windows of the store, and the fridges of course. When I got closer to the front of the store, where the registers were, I heard something fall off a shelf a few aisles away. Not very far at all from my position. 

I immediately crouched down and listened intently, holding my backpack so the items contained within wouldn't make a rustling noise from me jostling it around. I heard no other sounds, but I was sure the Stranger was still here. There was no way whatever that was had fallen on its own. 

Tears of fear slipped down my cheeks as I decided to abandon my backpack, deciding the contents of it were not worth the risk of it making a noise or slowing me down if I had a confrontation. I left it there on the floor as I changed directions, moving towards the back of the store to see if there was an emergency exit or back door I could exit from instead. I should've done that to begin with, but I don't tend to think too rationally when I'm scared at times. 

Indeed, all the way at the back, there were a set of double doors I could just barely make out. They were the kind that had this big silver bar in the middle you had to push to open them, and those always made a noise. I braced myself, and in one swift motion, opened the doors and slipped outside. 

Oh my god, it was absolutely freezing cold outside.

I did feel the back office get colder throughout the day, but I thought it was because of the AC or something. No, it's because it was snowing. Blankets of snow powdered the air, and the ground was quickly being painted all-white. The air felt like I had stepped into a freezer. It had just felt like summer yesterday, and at this time of day the sun was supposed to start setting, but twilight had already fully descended upon the world. The sky was black, not a star could be seen, and the moon was a tiny sliver barely visible. It was barely autumn, let alone early winter! 

While it certainly gave me a shock, I did not waste a moment thinking about the drastic change in weather. Instead, I made my way around the front and ran to the car I'd prepared to leave in. As soon as I opened the door, all the lights in the store came on, and it glowed yellow like a beacon in the dark. I froze and stared at the windows, my eyes scanning for any movement. I thought, for just a moment, that I saw a dark figure slip out of sight behind a shelf, but it was so subtle that it could've been a trick of my imagination. 

I got inside the car, shut and locked the door, ignited the engine, and drove out of that parking lot like a bat out of hell.

Once again, I cried. All I could think was, why? Why me? Why am I forced to endure this psychological torture? The only other person left here is stalking me, and I think they mean harm to me. Where is everyone? Where did you all go? Why did you leave me here by myself, with some fucking lunatic? 

WHY WON'T ANY OF YOU ANSWER MY MESSAGES?! 

Oh but don't think that's the worst part. The worst part is, it only took fifteen minutes for me to run out of gas, even though when I checked the car out the day before the tank said it was full. When I pulled over at a 7/11 to get gas, I noticed the tank was already open, as if someone had messed with it, and a tube that may have once been connected to something was sticking out still, dripping with a dark liquid. I hadn't noticed before, so desperate to get away, but 

Someone had siphoned the fucking gas! 

AND THERE'S ANOTHER FUCKING SMILEY FACE IN THE BACK WINDOW! 

It was drawn with a black marker. 

I checked the trunk and back seat, worried someone had hitched a ride without me knowing. Someone knew I was planning on using this car, and they could've definitely hid in here without me noticing it until it was too late. But they didn't. However, they did leave something in one of the back seats. 

My backpack that I had left in the store. 

How did they sneak out of there so quickly to put it in the car, then go back inside to turn on all the lights? It made no sense! No sense whatsoever! 

There has to be more than one, there has to be more than one‚Ä¶

I checked it. None of my things were inside. In fact, there were just 

Pictures. OF ME! 

Dozens of polaroids, showing me at various times over the past several weeks. Stealing from stores. Eating food. Scouting out cars. And even sleeping. 

In fact, there was a photo of me sleeping in the back office of that store. How THE FUCK did they get in? And without me waking up! The door was still locked when I got up!! That's impossible!!!

This was too much. I felt the entire world spin around me, but I still got behind the wheel and decided to drive as fast and far as I could. I was dizzy but I was also so, so afraid. I almost crashed a couple different times but I didn't care. I was in pure survival mode. 

That was a couple days ago. I'm writing this on my phone. I've been sleeping in my car with a knife ever since, and I plan on locating a gun store when I get to the coast so I can arm myself better, although I've no idea how to use a gun. I park my car deep in the woods at night, away from any buildings. Landmarks just make me easier to find. 

It's not long now until I get to the coast of North Carolina. I plan on getting on a boat and getting out of here. I'm not gonna do anything crazy, like sail to another continent, but I'm gonna skirt the coasts  till I get more down south. I don't feel safe traveling on land anymore. 

I'm going to keep updating as I go. This is the only thing that keeps me sane. I have hope that someone will reach out, or something will happen. I just think

1ij8s4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ij8s4z/first_machine_700/,First Machine [$700],"Hello everyone,

I am looking at getting my first machine. I have been looking at refurb GCP evo from Wholelattelove and the Gaggiuino mod. After a month of looking at the github, and trying to find a build guide that is more user friendly, I am pretty sure I wont be able to confidently do the mod and fear it would sit around or I'd wreck the machine or mod or both. I planned on already spending around $700 total on the GCPE $350 and the Gaggiuino mod $300 and any additional things I would need to install it, call it another $50-$100.

Currently my set up is a cheap Hamilton Beach gooseneck kettle without temp control (that I citric acid descale once a month), a plastic v60 (that is 5 years old and in need of replacing) and a Baratza encore (that I got refurbished from them in 2020) and swapped to virtuoso burrs. I am subscribed to Bottomless so I get fresh roasted coffee frequently based on my algorithm. I love Peixoto Honey I get from them more than others.

This setup has done me well for everyday coffee, but its time for a change.

That being the case....

I am looking for recommendations on espresso machines. In that price range that will need little to no mods. I will be using double filtered tap water (fridge filters and then into a brita) my city water is quite hard. When I go to a coffee shop, I generally drink lattes, and my partner likes a caramel macchiato. Do I ""need"" latte art.... no but it would be fun to learn.

I would prefer to stay in the 58mm group range because accessories for the 54mm for Bambino Plus or 57mm for the Lelit Anna are hard to find reasonably priced.

If you all think I should go with the GCPE and just temp surf I am ok with that it will allow me to speed the extra $400 on a mii coffee DF54 or DF64v2.  
I am also open to manual level machines like the Flair 58.

Eventually I would like to save the $3k and get a Lelit Bianca or a even a $6k La Marzocco Linea Mini

1ij8lzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1ij8lzx/coworkers_that_love_rto/,Coworkers that love RTO,"Obvious throwaway and vent. My company had a hybrid model ever since COVID some days in the office, some days at home, all depending on whoever your manager is. Pretty standard stuff. What comes as a bit of a surprise to me is how different people are when it comes to office presence. There is this boomer manager on my floor who just loves the office and makes sure to let everyone know how big/nice of a family we are.  
He is one of the loudest person around, micromanages most of his staff (except his hand picked favorites), and always gives backhand insults like ‚ÄúOh, going home already? It‚Äôs only 5:30PM, haha!‚Äù or ‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt seen you for a while in the office how many remote days do you have? Oh, only two? Wow, I come in every day.‚Äù It feels like a clown show everytime I see him honestly. What‚Äôs worse is that his entire team has now adopted this same attitude, and they‚Äôre all on board with coming in daily, sitting at these flex desks (that we need to book each day and leave spotless, so no personality there) in a cramped open plan office.

The part that is  irritating me is that none of them seem to care about the (many) downsides of our workplace: the end year reviews feel like a scam, there‚Äôs a high turnover rate, and the only workers that stick around are closet to retirement. Not to mention the soul sucking meeting culture that apparently requires us to be seated at  +0 minutes past the hour, only for nothing of value to be discussed. It‚Äôs honestly one of the most toxic workplaces I‚Äôve ever been in, and yet everyone on this manager‚Äôs team acts like they‚Äôre wearing rose-tinted glasses. They don‚Äôt even acknowledge how bad it is.

How can people tolerate this stuff and also not voice anything about this when e.g. going for lunch or coffee or similar? There probably is no hope left here, so I will just keep my head down until I find something better. Anyway, thanks for reading my rant.",6,1738864239.0,remotework,3,1.0,False

I had a deliverable due the next day and was expecting ad-hoc work calls. Since I had to look for an apartment myself, I agreed. She informed me that she would pick me up. I brought my laptop along.

The route felt never-ending. What was supposed to be a half-hour drive turned into an hour. I told her it was too far from my current location and not a feasible place for a residence. Then she remarked that instead of going out of her way to pick people up, she should ask them to meet at the spot. She said she had made this mistake several times by picking people up out of the way because she can‚Äôt figure out maps, which increases her travel time and distance. Mind you, I didn't ask her to pick me up, nor did I have any idea about the location.

After more than an hour‚Äôs drive, just when we reached the society we had to explore, I received an office ping on my Teams channel. I got into a call but had to inform them that I would call back in some time. It was close to 6 PM. I hurriedly saw two flats but didn‚Äôt find them promising. My friend wanted to explore more options with a broker. So, I went back to the car and took my call, which included screen sharing.

It was well after 7 PM when she was done. She asked me if I wanted her to drop me home or if we could sit somewhere. I told her I was okay with sitting at a place for some time and properly catching up with each other. She agreed but told me she would leave at 8:30 since she finds it difficult to drive at night. Mind you, it was already dark at 6:30 PM.

And her driving! I was praying for my life. On roads without dividers, she would drive in the middle of the road instead of on the left-hand side. There were oncoming heavy vehicles, and I thought she was going to drive into a truck. She gets startled easily and warned me at the beginning not to startle her when she's driving. I had to worry about what was worse‚Äîhearing her remarks in a caustic tone or getting crushed underneath a truck. I took my chances, with fear coursing through my veins‚Äîdevil or the deep sea. She is usually very abrupt, moody, and easily irritable in her demeanor, so sometimes I maintain distance for my own peace of mind.

While driving, there were several instances that made me realize she isn‚Äôt very situationally aware, and it‚Äôs risky to drive if one isn‚Äôt. I had to guide her a couple of times. I kept hitting the phantom brake while sitting in the passenger seat, slamming my foot on the floor. My face contorted, and I was holding onto the handle at the top of the car door (assist grips), praying for my life.

By the time we parked the car and entered a diner, it was 8:15 PM. I didn‚Äôt realize it was like a red line for her. She ordered something for herself. I saw chole rice and ordered them for myself. Then I ordered coffee for myself and asked her what she wanted. She said, ""Nothing!""

When my dinner arrived, I started relishing it but tried to eat as quickly as I could. She sat looking at me eat; she had already finished her vada pav. She looked uneasy. I told her she could leave if she wanted to. She asked me if I wanted to explore the place around, and I said, ""No!"" She said, ""No, I will drop you."" I‚Äôm pretty used to sitting alone at restaurants and having my meals, so I wouldn‚Äôt have minded. Then she started going on about how difficult it is for her to drive with glare from oncoming vehicles and how she likes to get back home by 9 PM. And I‚Äôm like, in my mind, ""Bitch, there‚Äôs glare at 8:55 PM too! It doesn‚Äôt magically appear at 9!"" She spoke with an irritated smile plastered on her face, with a twinge of sarcasm. I was gulping down food to finish quickly. Then, I asked the staff to bring my coffee, which I had completely forgotten about, and asked her if she would like coffee too. Again, that sarcastic, irritated smile appeared. ""Oh, I wanted to drink coffee too but didn‚Äôt knowingly take it because I wanted to leave at 8:30,"" she said in a caustic tone. It was around 8:40 when she made this statement. Then she asked the staff to give us a paper cup so that I could carry my coffee on the go. It was a very small cup of filter coffee, the kind you see at roadside tea stalls with tea worth Rs 5. I told her I couldn‚Äôt drink coffee in the car because it was hot and could spill on me. Anyhow, she dropped me home and we said our perfunctory goodbyes. Many times, I have realized that it feels like I walk on eggshells around her.

Later, I texted her that I retrospectively realized I should have ordered something else, or maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have gone to the restaurant at all. She apologized for hurrying me up with the same repeated message about how she can‚Äôt drive comfortably at night. It‚Äôs the same with me, but once it‚Äôs dark, it doesn‚Äôt matter much what time it is, unless the roads get too crowded with trucks.

My lessons:

1. Not to drop my work just because she is free and wants to hang out.


2. Avoid traveling with her in the car.

The Health Benefits of Choosing Vegan Desserts Over Traditional Sweets
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When you think about desserts, it‚Äôs often hard to imagine a sweet treat that is both indulgent and healthy. However, vegan desserts challenge that notion beautifully. They focus on plant-based ingredients, which can offer substantial health benefits in comparison to traditional sweets loaded with refined sugars and unhealthy fats.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
One of the most significant advantages of choosing vegan desserts is their emphasis on natural ingredients. Unlike traditional desserts that can contain dairy and eggs, vegan treats often rely on fruits, nuts, grains, and plant-based substitutes. This not only makes them suitable for those with lactose intolerance but also boosts their nutritional profile.

### Nutritional Benefits

Vegan desserts can be rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Here‚Äôs how they stack up nutritionally:

- **Lower in Saturated Fats:** Many traditional desserts contain butter and cream, which are high in saturated fats. In contrast, vegan desserts replace these with healthier fats from avocados, coconut oil, or nut butters.
- **Fiber-Rich Ingredients:** Vegan desserts frequently incorporate whole grains, nuts, and seeds. These ingredients add dietary fiber, which is essential for digestive health and can help keep you feeling full longer.
- **Natural Sweeteners:** Instead of refined sugar, plant-based desserts often use alternatives like maple syrup, agave, and dates, which can provide a lower glycemic index.
- **Plant-Based Nutrients:** Ingredients like fruits and nuts are packed with essential nutrients and can contribute to better overall health, as they come packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties.

### Weight Management

If you‚Äôre watching your weight, vegan desserts can be a great choice. They typically contain fewer calories than traditional sweets, especially those made from whole food ingredients. Since they are often less processed, they can help satisfy your sweet tooth without the guilty feeling that usually accompanies a sugar overload.

### Enhanced Mood and Energy Levels

Many people don‚Äôt realize that their food choices can significantly affect their mood. Vegan desserts, rich in whole foods, contribute to stable blood sugar levels. This means you‚Äôre less likely to experience the dreaded sugar crash that often follows indulgence in conventional sweets, leaving you with more stable energy and improved mood throughout the day.

-Get access to the Ultimate Vegan Cookbook package here--&gt; https://hownow101.com/vegan-recipes  
### Environmentally Friendly

‚ÄúYou still gotta try my famous biscuits ‚Äòn gravy!‚Äù he said as he hugged the both of us goodbye.¬† Curly always gave the best hugs, like he could understand and accept everything about you simply through the act of putting his arms around you.¬† It was no wonder Alice liked him so much.

Things went mostly back to normal after that.¬† Victor seemed to be happier, even when he was working, and he took more breaks than he used to.¬† Madame Blanc took a bit of a toll on him, enough that he was pretty weak for a while, so I ended up moving in with him about a month after the incident.¬† It made it easier for me to take care of him.¬†¬†

But the gallery was still on my mind.¬† I couldn‚Äôt forget what Victor had said that night in the hospital.¬†¬†

*She‚Äôll just keep eating.*¬† There had to be something I could do to get rid of the problem for good.¬† I reasoned that if there were babies (which I figured the smaller creatures were), there had to be a mother, and that was the ‚Äúshe‚Äù Victor had been referring to.¬† After a lot of thought and some Google searches that would concern any self-respecting FBI agent, I came to the conclusion that in order to get rid of Our Lady of Anguish for good, I needed to destroy the building that housed her.¬† Was the little stone church part of the organism or just a construct?¬† Who knew?¬† All I knew was I needed supplies.¬† But I didn‚Äôt know where to get things one would need to commit arson, like accelerant.¬† So I did something counterintuitive and texted Andrew.¬† Or, well, I tried to.

*-Hey, you got a minute?* I typed, expecting a quick response this late at night.¬† Andrew was always a night owl.

\-*Sure.*

*-I‚Äôve got a technical question.¬† Let‚Äôs say I hypothetically wanted to burn down a building, what would I need?*¬† It took a long time for a response.¬†¬†

\-*Arson is a crime, you know.*¬† I snorted.¬†¬†

*-Yeah, well, so is impersonating a police officer, I‚Äôm pretty sure.¬† I know it‚Äôs you, Austin.*¬† I sent a laughing emoji along with the message.¬†¬†

\-*Sorry.¬† He‚Äôs been a little out of it lately, as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre well aware.¬† How‚Äôd you know it was me?*

*-Andrew doesn‚Äôt use perfect grammar and punctuation in his texts.¬† He also uses way more emojis than you do.*

*-\[laughing emoji\] True.¬† So‚Ä¶you want to know how to burn down a building, huh?¬† Why?*

*-Like I said, hypothetical.*¬† The twins and Bridget were dealing with enough, they didn‚Äôt need to be worrying about me.¬†¬†

*-I can ask him,* Austin typed after a moment.¬† *He‚Äôd know more than I do.¬† All I could tell you is get a bunch of gasoline and light a match.*¬† There was a longer pause than usual.¬†¬†

\-*Heya, Livy.¬† How‚Äôs life?*

*-Drew?*

*-The one and only.¬† Sorry for the confusion, I‚Äôve had Austin answering my texts for a few days, my brain is still scrambled as hell.¬† He said u wanna know how to burn down a building?*

*-Yeah, hypothetically.*

*-Right.¬† Well, hypothetically, you want to get your hands on some acetone, you can find it at most hardware stores.¬† Decent accelerant, but it catches FAST, so you want to make sure you‚Äôre outside the building when you light it up.*¬†¬†

*-Matches or lighter?*

*-Either works.¬† I‚Äôd say matches, only because lighters carry a risk of exploding.¬† Shrapnel:¬† not even once.*¬† I laughed, shaking my head.¬† -*I hope you know what you‚Äôre doing.*¬†¬†

*-I‚Äôll be fine, Drew.¬† Thanks.*¬†¬†

*-No problem.¬† Stay safe, Liv.*

After checking in with the twins, it was time to go shopping.¬† I got several bottles of acetone from the local hardware store, explaining to the cashier that I dabbled in calligraphy art and needed the acetone to clean up potential ink spills.¬† Matches weren‚Äôt hard to come by, I had some at the house for candlelight dinners.¬† Perks of dating a closet romantic.



To my surprise, when I reached the culdesac at around four in the morning, the little stone church was exactly where I‚Äôd left it, and the door was open, taunting me, daring me to come inside.¬† The interior was dark and damp, the smell of rotting meat wafting up from the staircase leading to the chapel under the gallery.¬† Pulling the neckline of my shirt over my nose, I carefully made my way down the stairs.¬† The statue was in much the same condition as when I had last seen it, though there were a few small cracks in and around its face.¬† The thing was even more creepy up close, its carved eyes seeming to hold a faint glint of malice.¬† I pretended it wasn‚Äôt there and started pouring the bottles of acetone around the room, running a trail of the liquid up the wooden stairs so the whole building would hopefully catch.

‚Äú*Usssselesssssssss‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬† I jumped, whirling around to face the statue.¬† It hadn‚Äôt moved; why had I expected it to?¬† It was a statue.¬† And yet‚Ä¶

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù¬† Maybe I had gone crazy.¬† That was something crazy people did, talking to statues.¬†¬†

‚Äú*Your effortssssss are usssselessssssss‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬† The voice was grating and phlegmy, as if whatever was speaking had a very bad cold.¬† The liquid from the statue‚Äôs eyes began to flow thicker and faster.¬† ‚Äú*My children will feassssssst‚Ä¶I will feasssssst.‚Äù*¬† I rolled my eyes.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat, the little leech things from the hospital?¬† They‚Äôre gone.¬† I killed them.‚Äù¬† A resounding screech echoed through the small chamber, burrowing its way into my ears and splitting my head open.¬†¬†

‚Äú*Liesssssss!‚Äù* it hissed, and I saw more cracks forming in the face of the statue.¬† I started backing towards the stairs, reaching for the box of matches in my pocket.¬† ‚Äú*Your ssssssuffering will be ssssssucculent and ceaselessssss!‚Äù*¬† I‚Äôd made it angry.¬† Oops.¬† By this time, I‚Äôd reached the bottom of the stairs, feeling the sharp edge of the first step against the back of my ankle.¬† Grabbing a match, I struck it.¬† In the flickering light, I caught a glimpse of the statue‚Äôs face crumbling inward, revealing concentric spirals of long, gleaming teeth, dripping with saliva.

‚ÄúYou want suffering?‚Äù I asked.¬† ‚Äú*Bon appetit,* bitch.‚Äù¬† And I dropped the match.¬† I could feel the heat of the flames licking at my back as I turned and lunged up the stairs, hearing the splintering of stone behind me and the shrill cries of Our Lady of Anguish as she was engulfed.¬† Smoke filled the air, and I coughed, stopping only for a moment to wipe my stinging eyes before charging out into the parking lot.¬† The cool night air filled my lungs, and I bent over, hands on my knees as I wheezed for a moment.¬† A slam behind me caught my attention.¬† The giant evil lamprey-thing had made it out of the basement, but it was too fat to get through the door; too distended with the pain and tears of my friends.¬† I was fully content to just stand there and watch the motherfucker burn, but I was distracted by a rumbling from beneath me.

Before I could react, the asphalt under my feet suddenly buckled, crumbling downward in a circle around the church.¬† Shrieking, the creature pulled the little stone church in on itself, its claws curving around the mouldering rocks and crunching them to bits.¬† I yelped as the ground I was standing on caved in, and had I not managed to catch onto the edge of the resulting sinkhole, I would have fallen to my death.¬† Grunting, I tried to pull myself further up onto the pavement, but the ground was too unstable, and more of it disintegrated under my hands.¬† Just as I was about to fully slip off the ledge, a hand grabbed the back of my windbreaker and hauled me up, practically tossing me several feet away from the hole.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOof!‚Äù¬† I had the wind knocked out of me, but at least¬† I was away from the unstable ground.¬† Scrambling onto my rear, I looked up to find Neville standing next to the edge of the hole where I had just been.¬† He looked like hell; hair dishevelled, eyes red and glimmering with unshed tears, clothes torn and stained with black spots.¬† I couldn‚Äôt be sure due to the smoke, but I could have sworn I saw something move under the skin of his neck.¬† He staggered back a couple of steps, clutching at his stomach, before suddenly forcing himself to stand up straight.¬†¬†

And then, I saw Neville Pilgrim smile for the first and only time since I‚Äôd met him.¬† Frankly, it was closer to a grimace of pain, but I choose to believe he was smiling.¬†

‚ÄúThank you,‚Äù he said.¬† Before I could say anything in return, he took a couple more steps back, now on the very edge of the hole.¬† ‚ÄúTell them I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù¬† As if in slow motion, he toppled backwards, disappearing below the edge of the sinkhole.¬† Unsure of what else to do, I bowed my head and said a little prayer to the ancestors.¬† I didn‚Äôt have all the right tools to do a proper offering, but I hoped that much would give Neville at least a modicum of peace as he joined his gluttonous god in the abyss.¬† After that, I stood up, brushed myself off, and headed home.¬†¬†



When I got home, I found Victor in the kitchen, bopping his head to ‚ÄúNight Witches‚Äù by Sabaton as he got together the ingredients for his famous breakfast stir-fry.¬† I set down my house keys in the bowl I kept by the door and shucked off my jacket before taking a seat at the kitchen island.¬† He jumped when he turned and saw me, putting a hand to his chest.¬†¬†

‚ÄúBaby, you have *got* to make more noise when you walk, you‚Äôre going to give me a heart attack one of these days,‚Äù he said, switching off the music before coming over to give me a kiss.¬† ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôd you go, anyway‚Äìwhat the hell!*‚Äù*

‚ÄúWhat, what is it?‚Äù I asked, but he grabbed my hands, squinting at them.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYour hands look like frozen hamburger, what did you do?‚Äù he demanded.¬† ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre covered in schmutz, did you swim in a gravel pit before you came home?‚Äù¬† I laughed, hugging him.¬† He was finally back to his old self.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, V, I just fell off my bike on the way home,‚Äù I said.¬† He sighed and rested his chin on top of my head.¬† I could tell he didn‚Äôt believe me, but evidently he didn‚Äôt plan on pressing me.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt scare me like that, I thought you got hit by a car or something.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt.¬† I promise.‚Äù¬† We held each other for a long time, just breathing, just existing.¬† There was no way I‚Äôd killed that thing.¬† I couldn‚Äôt have, something so old wouldn‚Äôt go down that easily.¬† But I‚Äôd hurt it, badly enough that it had to retreat far underground.¬† It wouldn‚Äôt bother us again, I was sure of that.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go get cleaned up and get into something comfortable,‚Äù he said after a while.¬† ‚ÄúThis will take a while to cook.‚Äù¬† I reluctantly pulled away from him, realizing I was very sore and a hot shower sounded really, really good.¬† ‚ÄúI was thinking maybe tomorrow we could visit that exhibit you‚Äôve been wanting to go to, the one about the mummies?‚Äù

‚ÄúAww, Vitya.¬† I‚Äôd love to.‚Äù¬† I pecked his cheek before heading to the bathroom, stopping to chuck my dirty clothes in the hamper and grab some new ones.¬† As I went, I could faintly hear Victor humming an old Ukrainian lullaby.

  
**Epilogue**

It‚Äôs been a few months since the fire, and we‚Äôve finally settled down into a sense of normalcy.¬† Every few weeks, Victor and I get together with the twins, Bridget, and Austin‚Äôs boyfriend Henry for dinner, at Red Dragon Buffet, of course.¬† I‚Äôve started calling my mom more often, and once a month we go out for coffee.¬† I felt bad for not talking to her for so long after my dad died.¬† She‚Äôd been hurting too, but hadn‚Äôt been able to show it.

Victor still works in his studio pretty much every day except Fridays, since that‚Äôs our special day to spend together, and he‚Äôs even gotten a few of his sculptures into more art exhibitions‚Ä¶*legitimate* ones this time.¬† His latest one, ‚ÄúThe Dragon‚Äôs Blessing‚Äù, is ten feet tall and depicts a woman in ornate *hanbok* touching foreheads with a majestic serpentine dragon, whose body is partially obscured by the water beneath it.¬† In Korean culture, the dragon is a mystical creature known for its generosity and benevolence‚Ä¶either way, it‚Äôs an honor to be depicted alongside one, so the fact that Victor insisted I model for the piece gave me a little bit of an ego boost.

While my boyfriend is still his good-naturedly grumpy self, he‚Äôs become softer and more open since Our Lady left.¬† He talks to me about his feelings more, and he‚Äôs started seeing a therapist to work on his trauma and feelings of self-loathing.¬† The best part?¬† Last night marked the fifth week in a row that Victor stayed in bed the whole night, without any nightmares or his leg bothering him.¬†¬†

So if you‚Äôre ever walking around your city and come across a little stone church that you‚Äôre pretty sure wasn‚Äôt there before‚Ä¶stay away from it.¬† You‚Äôll be a lot happier that way.

I've made a decent amount of progress in the last year, both professionally and personally, but it just doesn't feel important anymore, you know?

I would love to have your impressions or thoughts about my story. 

I am in my 40s and he's 50. I met him on a dating app, however I was not in his country and just ""exploring"" the dating field there. 

I had not been dating for a few years, since my last relationship with an avoidant man traumatised me. I have been working on myself since then. And being on my guard. 

So in December, this guy matches with me and comes on really strong, his first message was jokingly asking me to be his last girlfriend. I explained I was just exploring and changed my location out of curiosity. He nevertheless kept messaging me showing a lot of interest in me.I made it clear I only wanted a relationship and he asked me if in the eventuality we would be right for each other if I would move to his country. I responded that was a possibility but would take time to get there.

He is a single dad of 2 teens and was never married. He has had a series of relationships since he separated from their mother, between 1 to 3 years each. We both had a relationship with an avoidant partner, but when I discovered his last attempt with his ex was a few months ago last summer, I felt turned off and told him he was not ready. He insisted and convinced me he already had rebounds and that he wanted someone that would make him happy and not miserable like the avoidant ex.

He said he wanted to come visit me in France soon, he is in Denmark. In the meantime, since we had so much time to get to know one another, I asked questions about what he wanted, his personality type etc. He said he also has an anxious preoccupied attachment style, like me, and tended to be too ""dependent"" in the past. I asked if he has had therapy. There were a few clashes after I expressed that I don't want a partner with female friends, meeting one on one.

This came up after he tried to bring the conversation to more sexual topic and I denied it, to which he responded his female friends talk about everything. This made me uncomfortable and I wondered if he was a player. He also said he had a lot of needs for closeness. After lots of arguing and proving his point, I felt turned off by the tug of war, but he agreed he would respect my preference if we were in a relationship.

  
We started having long phone calls and got to know each other more for many weeks. He was very invested daily, either call or texting. Very sweet and thoughtful. He booked his ticket to fly to Paris and a hotel.

Finally he came visit last week, for 5 days. We were both nervous to meet. The connection felt so good on the phone that I was afraid everything would be different if the chemistry was not there in person.

The first coffee date was lovely and he rapidly kissed me. I felt attracted to him too. He took me on nice dinner dates and it felt good. We became physically intimate. Maybe that was too fast.

There was a weird moment when I realised I don't know his name so I asked him. He was tired in bed and he started joking about being Mr Tired something for a few minutes, I felt suspicious. After that he said he said his name but I kept feeling triggered and asked for his passport (I know that sounds extreme). He wanted to sleep and not talk. I turned the lights back on and he said he didn't want to give it to me because he was afraid I would stalk him online. 

This made me upset and outraged, I confronted the fact that despite we had had sex he was no longer talking about being girlfriend / boyfriend. He said we were dating and not a couple yet. I said I was not on trial period and he must have had bad intentions towards me if he was suspicious about giving me his full name. It became messy and I told him to go back to his hotel.

The next day, he texted me he wanted to see me and talk. I agreed and we met. He said he should not have said that. BUT also felt like I crossed his boundaries and he let it slide (with the opposite sex friends). He said I was unreasonable. I responded that my feelings were valid and part of me, so if he invalided my feelings, instead of finding a resolution, it was a judgment and not helpful for the relationship. I have felt like he is very stubborn and wants to win the argument and can't see my point of view. As if he lacks empathy. And he said he felt criticised by me. Which is true.

We fell back into each other's arms. We spent the last days holding hands, having great sex, going out and he treated me well. I was affectionate and sweet, maybe too much. On the last day, he suggested I would visit him in Copenhagen. I agreed.

The same night we texted briefly but I felt immediately a shift in the communication. No goodnight text no call. I felt like it's ok maybe he needs to process his feelings after being close and meeting the real me. The following day, I only received a text in the evening ""How was your day""; I responded and he took more than 40 minutes to say he was glad to hear that. I asked about his day. NO response. The following morning still nothing. He left me on read. This was never the case before.

He texted at night an emoji üòò. No explanation as to why he left me on read the previous day. No phone call anymore, I decided to ignore that low effort communication.

So now it is 3 days he has left and I feel like I have lost the sweet guy he was before. The communication has changed. It feels like breadcrumbs. I don't feel like chasing, I feel betrayed and disappointed. Is he another avoidant man? A player that got what he wanted? 

Any thoughts or advice would be welcome! Thank you for reading me.

I‚Äôve almost got my groove back, though, so that's good, but please do tell me if I screwed something up here. And as always, enjoy.

///////////////////////

‚ÄúTHE INSPECTOR‚ÄôS COMING!‚Äù

The words boomed through the station's intercom, followed by the unmistakable sound of Officer Chen choking on his coffee. For a moment, there was perfect silence.¬†

Then‚Äîchaos.

The control room erupted into frenzied activity. Engineers dove for toolboxes, desperately concealing anything that looked remotely non-regulation. Lieutenant Walsh was spotted trying to jam rolls of duct tape into a paper shredder rather than explain why it was holding together a control panel.

The alien crewmembers froze in place, blindsided by the sudden panic in their human coworkers.

‚ÄúSir, what‚Äôs happen‚Äî‚Äù One of the aliens began to ask, but was cut off by Captain Rodriguez, who shot out of his chair and bolted past him.

""Hide the duct tape! ALL OF IT!"" Captain Rodriguez bellowed, already sprinting down the corridor. ""And someone get rid of the WD-40!""

***---------------------------------------------------------------------------***

In Maintenance Bay 1, Chief Martinez stared in absolute horror at the ten-foot stack of cargo crates they'd been using as an impromptu ladder. ""Oh god, oh god, where's the actual ladder?""

""We traded it to those Lifian merchants for coffee beans last month!""¬†

""WHAT?! Who approved that?!""

""You did! You said, and I quote, 'Ladders? For what? We‚Äôve got perfectly good crates!'""

‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù

The alien staff watched in confusion as their human colleagues ran around like headless chickens.

""I don't understand,"" Zyel, a junior electrician, clicked their mandibles nervously. ""Your species invented these safety protocols. Why are you panicking?

""BECAUSE WE KNOW EXACTLY HOW BAD IT IS!"" Martinez shrieked, grabbing Zyel by the shoulders. ""We made the rules *because* we know all the horrible ways we'll break them!""

Silpheen, another engineer, flicked their frilled ears in curiosity. ""But surely, if you follow these rules, there is no reason to fear the inspector, correct?""

The humans stopped mid-meltdown just long enough to exchange deeply haunted looks before resuming their desperate cover-up.

‚ÄúOh god...‚Äù Thompson‚Äôs face paled, having opened a cabinet to try and find a tarp to throw over the crates. ‚ÄúWHERE ARE ALL THE HARD HATS?!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe lost them!‚Äù Martinez shouted, now trying to hide a jar labelled 'Misc. Sharp Things' anywhere he could manage.

‚ÄúHOW DO YOU MANAGE TO LOSE HARD HATS?‚Äù

""Same way we lost the emergency eye-wash station!""

""THAT WASN'T LOST! IT GOT BLOWN UP!""

‚ÄúEXACTLY!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh god, we‚Äôre screwed.‚Äù Thompson whimpered, dragging his hands down his face. ‚ÄúOSHA‚Äôs going to fuck us six ways to Sunday.‚Äù

Zyel observed the chaos with a growing sense of unease. ""Humans... what exactly happens if this ‚ÄòOSHA‚Äô being finds violations?""

There was another moment of silence.

Then Thompson whispered, ""Paperwork.""

Zyel blinked. ""Paperwork?""

He shuddered violently. ""SO. MUCH. PAPERWORK.""

Martinez swayed slightly, leaning on the crate stack for support, the tower wobbling precariously. ""Do you have any idea what it's like to spend ten hours detailing why and how someone thought using a roll of tape to patch a spacesuit was a good idea?""

‚ÄúIt said it was pressure-sealing!‚Äù

""A MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK, TOMMY, *A MOUNTAIN.*""

The intercom crackled again. Rodriguez's voice had taken on the particular tone of someone watching their career dissolve in real-time. ""New problem. Why do I have someone telling me the oxygen generators are labelled with EMOJI STICKERS?""

""Ah shit,"" Thompson muttered before keying his communicator. ""The original labels kept peeling off!‚Äù

Silpheen and Zyel shared a horrified look as they watched this conversation transpire.

‚ÄúHear me out, it makes sense‚Äîskull emoji means deadly, fire emoji means flammable, pizza emoji means‚Äî""

""WHY IS THERE A PIZZA EMOJI ON THE OXYGEN SYSTEM?!""

""Because that's where we've been storing the pizza! The fridge was full and the coolant keeps it fresh!""

Rodriguez let out a strangled noise somewhere between a sob and a scream, the sound cutting off as the intercom went silent again.

Silpheen took a cautious step back. ""So, to be clear... you fear not the enforcement of these regulations, but rather the paperwork that follows?""

""YES! BOTH! I DON'T KNOW!""

""Wouldn‚Äôt it be more productive if you just‚Ä¶ followed these regulations?""

""What?"" Thompson looked at Zyel as if they‚Äôd had just grown another head. ""No. Are you crazy?""

‚ÄúAre you? They're there for your safety, aren't the‚Äî‚Äù

The intercom crackled to life again, interrupting Silpheen mid-sentence.

""Inspectors here."" Rodriguez whispered, his voice deathly quiet.

‚Äú*WHAT*.‚Äù Martinez‚Äôs eyes went wide as he shouted through his communicator. ‚ÄúDELAY THEM OR WE‚ÄôRE SCREWED.‚Äù

Silence.

‚ÄúHELLO? *RODRIGUEZ?!*‚Äù

***---------------------------------------------------------------------------***

The bulkhead doors hissed open, and a single figure stepped inside.

Inspector Eleanor Graves was a small, unassuming woman in a crisp uniform, a tablet tucked neatly under one arm. She adjusted her glasses and took a slow, measured look around the control room.

Rodriguez was still bent over a microphone, screaming into it. Walsh hunched by the paper shredder, sweat on his brow. He clutched the rolls of tape like live grenades while, across the room, Chen fought to hide a spool of frayed wire in a cabinet.

*Typical.* Graves cleared her throat.

The chaos in the control room disappeared, everyone freezing in place mid-motion, time looking like it had stopped. Rodriguez whispered something into the microphone before slowly turning around, a nervous smile on his face.

Looking like he was about to throw up, he swallowed hard and stepped forward.

""Inspector Graves,"" he said, voice strained but polite. ""Welcome aboard. How was the trip?""

She tapped a note into her tablet. ""Captain Rodriguez."" A pause. ""What‚Äôs this I heard about a pizza sticker on an oxygen generator?""

Rodriguez opened his mouth. And closed it just as fast, the excuse he had prepared dying on his lips.

The fear got to Walsh first. ""The fridge was full.""

The silence that followed was deafening.

Graves let out a long, slow sigh and scrolled down her tablet. ""You do realise this inspection will involve a full safety audit?""

Rodriguez flinched. Walsh whimpered. Chen made a tiny, strangled noise. An alien crewmember groaned loudly in the back. ‚ÄúNot *again.*‚Äù

Graves observed them all, expression unreadable. Then, in a voice that promised nothing but bureaucratic suffering, she said,

""*Let's begin, shall we.*""

1ij83jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/1ij83jd/the_unpredictable_joy_of_sending_ethereum/,The Unpredictable Joy of Sending Ethereum,"The internet has always been a playground for the absurd, the spontaneous, and the delightfully random. From meme-driven cryptocurrency rallies to viral challenges that defy logic, there‚Äôs something uniquely human about embracing chaos just to see what happens. Which brings me to my humble request:¬†*Send me Ethereum‚Äîany amount‚Äîfor no reason other than ‚Äúshits and giggles.‚Äù*

Let‚Äôs start with the obvious question:¬†*Why?*¬†Well, why not? In a world where algorithms dictate our choices and practicality often overrules whimsy, there‚Äôs beauty in doing something utterly pointless. Cryptocurrency, with its decentralized, borderless, and often meme-fueled ethos, is the perfect vehicle for such frivolity. Ethereum, specifically, isn‚Äôt just a currency‚Äîit‚Äôs a gateway to smart contracts, NFTs, and decentralized apps. But today, let‚Äôs strip it down to its purest form: digital money that can zip across the globe in seconds. Why not use that power to fuel a moment of shared absurdity?

Imagine this: You‚Äôre scrolling through your wallet, staring at that 0.003 ETH dust leftover from a forgotten trade. It‚Äôs not enough to buy a coffee, but it‚Äôs¬†*something*. Instead of letting it languish, you could send it to a stranger (me!) and spark a tiny, inexplicable connection. Maybe I‚Äôll laugh, screenshot it, and post it online with a caption like, ‚ÄúSomeone actually did it!‚Äù Maybe I‚Äôll use it to buy a fraction of a shitcoin named after a cartoon dog. Or maybe I‚Äôll just let it sit there, a digital monument to the randomness of the universe. The point is:¬†*You don‚Äôt know.*¬†And that‚Äôs the fun.

This isn‚Äôt about charity, investment, or even gratitude. It‚Äôs about participating in a micro-experiment of human curiosity. Think of it as dropping a dollar into a wishing well, except the well has a blockchain address (**0xAB53251a763d35c063bF4411445715c1726a1**) and the wish is just‚Ä¶ vibes. Cryptocurrency culture thrives on these moments‚Äîremember when people tipped Bitcoin for good Reddit comments? Or when Dogecoin tips flooded Twitter? Those gestures weren‚Äôt about wealth; they were about community, humour, and the joy of saying, ‚ÄúI see you, weirdo.‚Äù

Of course, scepticism is fair. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs in it for me?‚Äù Nothing tangible. But consider the intangibles: the thrill of hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù on a transaction that serves no purpose. The smirk when you imagine me refreshing my wallet, wondering if anyone‚Äôs reckless enough to indulge this request. The solidarity of acknowledging that yes, sometimes we do things just because we can.

And let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîEthereum‚Äôs transaction fees (*gas*) have plummeted since the merge, so it‚Äôs cheaper than ever to be whimsical. Sending 0.001 ETH might cost you a few dollars in fees, but it buys a story. Maybe yours will be the address I meme-ify in a TikTok. Perhaps we‚Äôll become folklore in some niche crypto subreddit. Or maybe it‚Äôll vanish into the ether, forgotten by everyone except the blockchain‚Äôs immutable ledger.

Still not convinced? Let‚Äôs reframe this. The internet has normalized sending strangers money for far less compelling reasons. People donate to streamers playing video games in their pyjamas. They fund Kickstarters for potato salad. They buy virtual ‚Äúlikes‚Äù for Instagram posts. Compared to that, sending a few dollars worth of ETH to¬†**0xAB53251a763d35c063bF4411445715c1726a1**¬†is practically poetic.

In the grand scheme, this request is a love letter to crypto‚Äôs anarchic roots. Before Wall Street invaded and ‚Äúnumber go up‚Äù became a religion, cryptocurrency was about experimentation, rebellion, and laughing at the absurdity of traditional finance. Sending ETH ‚Äúfor shits and giggles‚Äù is a nod to that spirit‚Äîa reminder that money can be fun, even if just for a moment.

So, if you‚Äôve read this far, why not embrace the chaos? Open your wallet, copy my address, and send whatever amount makes you grin. A millionaire‚Äôs dust? A whale‚Äôs pocket change? A few dollars? It doesn‚Äôt matter. What matters is the gesture: a digital high-five across the blockchain, proof that somewhere out there, someone else thinks pointless joy is worth a few clicks.

Personal details
23 male, no major health afflictions. 
Zaleplon and/or Zolpidem for sleep as needed
Venlafaxine for depression 
Adderall/generic for focus

Smaller health issues:
-Poor diet balance (large majority grains but this is nothing new)
-Slightly high blood pressure at last physical, but likely due to stress at the time
-Easily over heat/mild heat intolerance 

Context
I‚Äôve worked night shift for over 2 years and as a result I occasionally take the above mentioned sleeping pills. I‚Äôve been off work for a few days and have slept maybe 4 hours a day, likely less. I was unable to sleep for even 3 hours on Monday the 3rd despite taking multiple sleep pills throughout the day. I expected to be too exhausted to work that night so I called in, only to be wide awake almost the entire night. Since then I‚Äôve only felt tired enough for short naps, 2-3 hours at the most before I‚Äôd wake up. Keep in mind that there was no build up to this. Just very sudden. I don‚Äôt even drink coffee or energy drinks. Most caffeine I get is from the occasional soda. Anyway, happy to answer questions to get pointed in the right direction with this.
Thanks lads

Less important part:
With all that said, I‚Äôm not opposed to needing less sleep, but I‚Äôm not sure if I should get used to it and enjoy the extra time in the day.  I‚Äôve never experienced something like this before and at this point it‚Äôs lasted well over 3 days. I feel like I should have crashed by now. Hopefully someone can point me in the right direction.

1ij7x3z,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaModelX/comments/1ij7x3z/1263_fsd_update_pros_and_cons_legacy_preraven/,12.6.3 FSD Update Pros and Cons (Legacy pre-Raven 2019 P100D),"This update made the most difference of any in a while, in both good and bad ways.

Notes: 

* Modes changed. Assertive mode is now ""Hurry"" mode and blue on the dashboard. You can only see the speed you've set it to when changing the speed, otherwise it just says ""Hurry"" which is annoying for a reason I'll get into below.
* Relative speed adjustments are only in mph now, the % option went away. I used to use 9% over and cannot anymore.

Pros:

* Much better at keeping up with traffic. Only a couple instances of going below the speed limit.
* Much smoother and more assertive automatic lane changes, especially when zippering or changing lanes to get off on an exit during rush hour.
* Much more confident at sharp turns that have the yellow arrow caution signs for sharp turns. The last update would slow the car down to FAR slower than necessary, this one is much better.
* My blocked cameras are suddenly fixed :-). The last update was constantly bitching about my cameras being blocked, zero complaints about cameras so far with this update.
* 90% reduction in it complaining about keeping my hands on the wheel. In the last update I had to keep annoying strong force on the wheel to avoid FSD strikes and that seems to have been fixed.

Cons:

* 90% of the time the car doesn't listen to my relative speed settings anymore, and I don't catch it as quickly because the relative speed isn't constantly shown anymore.  So despite setting relative speed as 4mph over, it'll max out at 65mph on a 65 speed limit instead of 69mph and I won't notice because I can't see what the max speed limit is set to.
* Twice this week it's gone to change lanes and then had a personality crisis in the middle, which resulted in it driving half in each lane until I pulled it out of FSD and restarted the FSD.  The second time the roads were mostly empty and I let it go to see what it would do and it drove miles down the highway splitting lanes :-D
* Twice it has made sharp turns into parking lots thinking they were roads despite navigation being on and the turn still being a half mile up the road. 
* I live in the country, and where the last update would FSD all the way to my door down my long dirt driveway, this update blows right past my turnoff and then gets confused and gives up.
* It's not nearly as steady driving on a straightaway as the last update. I've spilled coffee on myself a few times already and it's getting annoying. It often feels like somebody is pulsing the gas pedal to maintain speed, instead of maintaining constant pressure. The last update was far smoother when just driving along at a steady speed.",3,1738862541.0,TeslaModelX,0,1.0,False

We begin with a *dramatis personae* advising characters that have come before, including a contractual obligation.

**Chapter 1: A Cretan Minotaur in Nebraska**

Thursday Next and Commander Bradshaw are chasing the Minotaur through the wild west genre, following custard pie clues, having dosed the Minotaur with a bit of slapstick. They think they‚Äôre on the right track. Someone has seen him in the last few days and suddenly there‚Äôs a shootout - the sheriff‚Äôs been shot and Bradshaw responds by shooting the shooter. Meanwhile Thursday has called for backup and Emperor Zhark and Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle appear, truly ruining the day, even though they believe they‚Äôve helped. Overwhelmed as a solo parent, her husband Landen Park-Laine having still not existed, Thursday vows to leave Jurisfiction within a week.

**Chapter 2: No Place Like Home**

Thursday has asked to leave Jurisfiction and they‚Äôve given her permanent home leave for the time being, thinking she‚Äôll sort herself out. She is escorting Hamlet to her mum‚Äôs for dinner. Thursday‚Äôs mum‚Äôs house is a round robin of random dead historical guests and family all catching up (time travel is complicated). Friday, Thursday‚Äôs 2-year-old who only speaks *Lorem ipsum*, keeps getting into everything.

Thursday‚Äôs dad has been having some timeline trouble with Lord Nelson, and has asked Thursday‚Äôs mum for some help. Lord Nelson‚Äôs consort, Lady Emma Hamilton, has also been working with Thursday‚Äôs dad and her mum is suspicious. Emma and Hamlet thankfully hit it off. Goliath looks to be working to become a full-fledged religion. Also, a resurrection of St. Zvlkx is meant to occur in a couple days. Finally, Thursday‚Äôs mom seems to be hitting it off with the Prussian Chancellor, Herr Otto Bismarck. Thursday reminisces about her past with Landen (and his broken future-past).

Thursday visits Granny Next who warns about how Ophelia would feel about Hamlet and Emma‚Äôs relationship. Getting back to her mum‚Äôs house Thursday sees two people casing the joint - it turns out they‚Äôre both stalkers. One is hers, Millon de Floss, and the other is *his* stalker, Adam Gnusense. Thursday asks Millon for info, and hopes her stalker will turn out to be an ally.

**Chapter 3: Evade the Question Time**

Joffy and Thursday attend a live taping of *Evade the Question Time*, a talk show where points are awarded to guests when they successfully don‚Äôt answer questions. Yorrick Kaine, the Chancellor of the Whig Party, is up against Redmond van de Poste, of the Commonsense Party. They both tow the party line but Yorrick ‚Äúwins‚Äù out. As the guests are leaving the studio Thursday attempts to grab Kaine‚Äôs hand and pull him into the BookWorld. She finds herself strangely swept away with his appeal. She accidentally pulls an innocent bystander into the BookWorld instead and immediately brings him back. She‚Äôll need a new approach to trap Kaine.

**Chapter 4: A Town Like Swindon**

The morning after the show Thursday survives the first of what will be three assassination attempts by Cindy Stoker, Spike Stoker‚Äôs wife. Her dad has stopped time and fills her in on some details. He‚Äôs working at the ChronoGuard, which confuses Thursday. He says they‚Äôll meet again three hours from now, so hopefully she‚Äôll know more soon.

Breakfast begins and Hamlet and Emma come down, not hiding very much. Thursday‚Äôs mum has saved her Porsche, and Thursday takes Hamlet with her on some errands, including a much-needed haircut for Thursday. Hamlet is surprised at the Will-Speak Machine (a Hamlet one, of course) and he compares Hamlet to several works of popular fiction.

**Chapter 5: Ham(let) and Cheese**

Thursday and Hamlet are at a bank to check her overdraft. Outside she is asked for her autograph by a solicitor. Her account is overdrawn by ¬£22k, no small amount. Outside the bank Thursday is nearly steamrolled (like, actually steamrolled) but she and Hamlet are able to continue their discussion of how real life differs from fiction.

Before visiting SpecOps they stop for coffee and Thursday spots a familiar face in the barista, Mr. Cheese. He tells her there might be a way to get Landen back, but she has to formally apply to Goliath. She leaves Hamlet at the coffee shop and tells him to tell no one who he really is.

**Chapter 6: SpecOps**

Back in SpecOps Thursday is welcomed heartily and taken up to interview for her old job. Before she goes in she is taken aside by Bowden, who tries to warn her about what‚Äôs going on. Before he can finish giving her all the details she‚Äôs taken by Braxton-Hicks. He scolds her for a few things, mostly not learning to golf. She is suddenly threatened by Colonel Flanker, of SO-1. Braxton-Hicks defends and lies for her. He tells her in return he just wants a few rounds of golf.

**Chapter 7: The Literary Detectives**

Thursday gets the lowdown from her old crew, and she fills them in on where she‚Äôs been with Jurisfiction, too. They are happy to see her, as there‚Äôs a lot going on. She says she can join them again in about a week, after she‚Äôs able to sort reliable childcare.

**Chapter 8: Time Waits for No Man**

On the way out of SpecOps Thursday spots the ChronoGuard office. She pops in and rings for an agent and her dad appears. He‚Äôs younger but recognizes her and he warns her of the dangers of Yorrick Kaine. All she has to do is make sure Swindon wins the Superhoop (causality and all that). He‚Äôs also going to look into her little assassin problem.

1ij7t9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1ij7t9d/how_to_organize_lists_in_google_maps/,How to Organize Lists in Google Maps,"I finally figured out a system that works great for both planning and tracking my trips. Sharing for anyone who struggles with unmanageable map like I did.

I have 3 major categories of places represented by shapes:
- üíõüíöüíô‚ù§Ô∏è Activities (what to do: landmarks, museums, sightseeing, parks, other activities)
- üü°üü¢üîµüî¥ Food (where to eat: restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores)
- üü®üü©üü¶üü• Shopping (things to buy: grocery stores, clothing, souvenirs, local brand stores, malls)

Different colors roughly coordinate with colors of standard prebuilt lists (green to go, pink favorites, yellow starred, blue travel plans) which made it easier to transition to the new system. These colors are also hard to confuse with each other. It reflects priority and creates somewhat a heat map:
- üü®Must/Planned
- üü©Maybe/Someday
- üü¶Visited
- üü•Favorite 

So, there are total of 12 lists, e.g.
- ‚Äúüíõ Activities - MUST‚Äù
- ‚Äúüíö Activities - MAYBE‚Äù
- ‚Äúüíô Activities - VISITED‚Äù
- ‚Äú‚ù§Ô∏è Activities - FAVORITE‚Äù 
You got the idea.

Now when I look at the map at a glance I can:
- Quickly differentiate between types of places to find activities I‚Äôm looking for based on the emoji shape.
- Based on the color I can then zero in on places that are planned vs ones I‚Äôve added just in case. I can also review all visited places while highlighting favorites I‚Äôd like to recommend or visit again.
- I usually turn off all visited places from the map view to hide it once it‚Äôs visited. Also I can turn off food and shopping lists when I focus on sightseeing. However makes sense to create a more focused map view.
- Because these lists use custom emojis, as a bonus I can also easily see places from other shared lists that I‚Äôve added from others, because they have standard icons that stand out from my personal lists.

There are only a few downsides to this system:
- It works great on the phone, but desktop still does not support custom emojis... [Google probably will start supporting it, seems like a parity issue. Also my life will be complete if they introduce map icons with different colors similar to Google My Maps or Notion, but I digress.]
- Another small inconvenience is if you have a note, you need to manually copy and paste it when you move a place from one list to another. Usually when I move a place from planned to visited list, I just add a new note reflecting my actual experience, for example price and tips.

I also repurposed prebuilt lists, they are now useful too: 
- üíó Favorites: important places, usually places I regularly go or navigate to or from (work, hotels, gym, transportation hubs, school, etc.)
- ‚≠êÔ∏è Started: errands & must do today (during travel I may mark where the entrance to the large park is, luggage storage, post office, restaurant I want to go that day, etc.)
- ‚õ≥Ô∏èWant to Go: this list is basically my inbox (I can quickly save any places without thinking where to put it with a quick note and sort it later)
- üß≥ Travel Plans: countries & cities I want to visit (future travel destinations ideas)

Finally, I have a few activity specific custom lists, for example Halloween, Christmas lights, Kids Friendly, Coffee - mostly used for my ‚Äúhome‚Äù map, because it naturally has the most saved places and needs more organization. 

I used this system for some time for different kind of trips as well as my ‚Äúhome‚Äù map with the most saved places, so far this system worked GREAT! It is very intuitive, easy to manage once you set it up, and the map is infinitely easier to use.

Coming on this subreddit gives me good feedback and things to try, but it‚Äôs kind of like a productive way to continue to ruminate on my relationship, lol. I haven‚Äôt written a song in a little while, but I do find that cathartic for actually releasing sadness and  fear.

But the one thing that seems to always actually force me to stop ruminating is doing something/hanging out with/conversing with someone other than my husband and kids. I think it actually helps more when I‚Äôm not talking about anything to do with marriage or my husband. Venting can sometimes help, but can also encourage spiraling for me. It could be a play date with a friend, coffee with my sister, or even just talking to the aesthetician the whole time she‚Äôs doing my facial. Somehow it brings me out of the little microcosm that is my family unit, it puts my problems in perspective, reminds me that there is a whole world of people to connect with, and gives me new interesting information about life that has nothing to do with my husband. Sometimes I‚Äôm able to bring that information back into my relationship in the form of an interesting conversation too!

Last night I was starting to get scared about Valentine‚Äôs Day after expressing a pure desire (those ‚Äúimportant relationship days,‚Äù ugh, WHY do I have so many so close together! ü§™). We were on our way to my sister‚Äôs house for dinner, and she was having our parish priest over. It was so great. 4 hours of my kids eating and playing with their cousins, great adult conversation, singing with my sister while my BIL and the priest played guitar, and I got to ask this priest all these random questions that had nothing to do with relationships. My husband was in the conversation too, but it was like I was able to hear him the same way as anyone else there, without the baggage. And no rumination!

My theory is that this has to do with attachment styles. I know that I‚Äôm anxiously attached in my core, and as such, I have a tendency to hyper-fixate on my relationship to my ‚Äúattachment person.‚Äù My attachment style and the fact that I‚Äôm an extrovert also means I simply have a higher need for connection, which can‚Äôt all be met by one person. I think that this is potentially a healthy ‚Äúdeactivating strategy.‚Äù

Anyway, I‚Äôve seen a number of women in here (usually in a high state of duress) say that they don‚Äôt like self-care, and that it doesn‚Äôt make them feel good. If this is you, maybe pairing self care and connection by bringing another person into the mix can help.",2,1738861772.0,surrendered_wife,1,1.0,False

Don't worry, I've got your back. As someone who travels frequently, I know how frustrating it is when you can't access your regular TV channels abroad. But here's some good news: you can still watch all your beloved Israeli content with the right tools and setup.

# Why Can't You Watch Israeli TV Channels Abroad?

When you try to stream Israeli channels like **Cellcom TV**, **Kan 11**, or **Keshet 12** from outside Israel, you'll hit a wall. These platforms check where you're connecting from, and if they spot a foreign location, they'll block your access faster than you can say ""shalom.""

The reason? It's all about **copyright laws** and **regional regulations**. TV channels must follow strict rules about where they can broadcast their content. This means even if you're a paying subscriber, stepping outside Israel's borders cuts you off from your regular shows and news updates.

# The Smart Solution: Using a VPN

A **Virtual Private Network** (VPN) is your golden ticket to watching Israeli TV from anywhere. It works like magic but it's actually pretty simple tech. When you use a VPN, it makes your internet connection look like it's coming from Israel, even if you're sipping coffee in Paris or working in New York.

# Benefits of Using a VPN for Streaming:

1. **Access to Israeli Content**: Watch everything from news to entertainment without restrictions
2. **Better Streaming Speed**: Good VPNs prevent your internet provider from slowing down your connection
3. **Strong Security**: Your streaming activity stays private and protected
4. **Multiple Device Support**: Watch on your phone, laptop, or smart TV

# Best VPNs for Watching Israeli TV Channels

Let's look at the top VPN services that'll give you solid access to Israeli content. I've tested these myself and they really deliver on their promises.

# ExpressVPN: The Premium Choice

**ExpressVPN** stands out as the top pick for streaming Israeli TV. Here's why it's worth your money:

* **Server Network**: They've got more than 3000 servers across 105 countries, including speedy ones in Israel
* **Streaming Performance**: You can watch shows in 4K quality without those annoying buffering circles
* **Security Features**: They use strong encryption and don't keep any records of what you watch
* **Device Support**: One subscription lets you connect 8 devices at once
* **Money Back Guarantee**: Try it risk free for 30 days

# CyberGhost: Budget Friendly Option

If you want quality without breaking the bank, **CyberGhost** might be your perfect match:

* **Israeli Servers**: 97 servers in Jerusalem give you plenty of connection options
* **Speed**: Their 10 Gbps servers handle streaming like a champ
* **Security**: Bank grade encryption keeps your data safe
* **Trial Period**: 45 days to get your money back if you're not happy
* **Device Limit**: Connect up to 7 devices simultaneously

# NordVPN: Reliable Alternative

**NordVPN** brings some cool features to the table:

* **Server Coverage**: 20+ servers in Tel Aviv
* **Special Features**: Their NordLynx protocol gives you extra speed
* **Streaming Support**: Works great with Cellcom TV, Mako TV, and other Israeli platforms
* **Security Focus**: Military grade encryption and zero logs policy
* **Device Support**: Connect 6 devices at once

# How to Set Up Your VPN for Israeli TV

Getting started is easier than you might think. Here's what you need to do:

# 1. Pick Your VPN Service

Choose one of the recommended VPNs above based on your needs and budget. My personal go to is ExpressVPN because it just works without any fuss.

# 2. Download and Install

* Go to your chosen VPN's website
* Pick a subscription plan (longer plans usually save you money)
* Download the app for your device
* Follow the simple installation steps

# 3. Connect to Israel

* Open the VPN app
* Find and select a server in Israel
* Hit the connect button
* Wait for confirmation (usually takes seconds)

# Why Free VPNs Aren't Worth the Risk

Look, I get it. Free stuff sounds great, but when it comes to VPNs, there's usually a catch. Let me share what I learned the hard way before switching to a paid service.

# The Hidden Costs of Free VPNs

Free VPN providers have to make money somehow, and often it's by:

* Selling your browsing data to advertisers
* Showing you lots of annoying ads
* Limiting your streaming speed so badly you'll see more loading screens than actual content
* Some don't even bother encrypting your data (yikes!)

Think about it: running servers costs money. If you're not paying for the service, you're probably paying with your privacy instead.

# Tips for the Best Streaming Experience

After months of watching Israeli TV from abroad, I've picked up some useful tricks:

# Choose the Right Server

Not all Israeli servers are created equal. Here's what I do:

1. Test different server locations during off peak hours
2. Save the ones with the best performance as favorites
3. If one server feels slow, switch to another

# Optimize Your Connection

Got buffering issues? Try these fixes:

* Connect your device to your router with an ethernet cable instead of WiFi
* Close background apps that might be using your internet
* Clear your browser cache and cookies
* Try different VPN protocols (my connection usually works best with WireGuard or OpenVPN)

# Common Problems and Solutions

# ""The VPN Won't Connect to Israeli Servers""

First, check if your internet is working without the VPN. Then try:

* Switching to a different Israeli server
* Restarting your VPN app
* Making sure your VPN app is up to date

# ""The Streaming Site Still Shows I'm Not in Israel""

This usually means the site detected the VPN. Quick fixes:

* Clear your browser cookies
* Try a different browser
* Contact your VPN's support team (they often have specific servers for streaming)

# Making the Most of Your Israeli TV Experience

Once you're all set up, you'll have access to tons of great content. Some of my favorites include:

* **News Updates**: Stay connected with live broadcasts from Kan 11 and Channel 13
* **Local Shows**: Catch all the latest episodes of popular Israeli series
* **Sports Coverage**: Never miss an important match again

Remember, a good VPN is like a subscription to freedom. It might cost a few bucks a month, but the ability to access your favorite content from anywhere is priceless.

# Final Thoughts

Getting around geo blocks to watch Israeli TV isn't rocket science, but you need the right tools. While free VPNs might tempt you, investing in a reliable service like ExpressVPN will save you headaches in the long run.

Think of it this way: for about the price of a fancy coffee each month, you get secure, unlimited access to all your favorite Israeli content. Plus, you're protecting your online privacy at the same time.

Don't let geographic restrictions keep you from staying connected to Israeli culture and entertainment. With the right VPN, you're just a few clicks away from feeling right at home, no matter where you are in the world.

Want to get started? I'd recommend trying ExpressVPN with their 30-day money back guarantee. That way, you can test everything risk free and see how it works for you.",1,1738861711.0,TheVpnEng,0,1.0,False

I have done some research and watched various youtube videos but still can't make up my mind, so I am asking for your help. 

I started my journey in the world of espresso two years ago with a Delonghi Dedica and I think it is time to upgrade. So far I have been using pre-ground coffee from a local roastery and using the pressurized basket. 

I would like to move to the next step with a budget of about 500-700 ‚Ç¨ for coffee machine + grinder and the most common options are Breville Bambino Plus / Gaggia Classic Pro / Rancilio Silvia / Lelith Anna + DF64.

I understand that the GCP is a standard for a semi-pro level but what stops me from preferring it over the BBP is: it needs some upgrades, it is (as we say in italy) **ugly** as starvation.

Below are my needs:

\- if there was a coffee grinder, with good performance, cheaper than 300‚Ç¨ would be better. I will grind mainly dark Italian roast.

\- I make Italian cappuccino very often and need a good milk frother 

\- the aesthetic factor is a minor aspect but will be part of the choice



The first question that comes to mind is: is the Gaggia Classic Pro so clearly better than the Bambino Plus?",1,1738861529.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1ij7fo2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ij7fo2,"8 DPO Extended TT, Waist Lipo, MR & Tips (27m)","Hey all, i just wanted to come on and give a real quick update as a 27yo male since it was hard to find a lot of similar bodies and before/after as a male. 

I had started writing up a long post about my post op timeline but that would take forever, so just some things I experienced. In the following paragraphs I'll put an asterisk next to one's with some tips or info that you may want to know if you have some fears in case you don't want to read this whole post. 

Also, a question I have for those further into recovery (especially males), how much did your swelling decrease as the weeks went on? I'm glad to be flatter now, but I'm still much wider than I'd like to be. I'm sure I have a lot of swelling still, but I have no idea how much I should expect to see it go down and what to expect as a final result. I do not want a bulge that I seem to currently have.

A bit of background, at one point I was 300lbs and about 130-140lbs (I roughly fluctuate between 165-175). I had stabilized at this weight for a few years which is when I pulled the trigger. 

Honestly I think I'm in the minority of recovery than most people. I never really had any pain at all post surgery, and still don't. I was taking my oxycodine as prescribed for the first couple of days alternating between that and gabapentin/tylenol and methocarbonal every 3 hours like I was told. On day 3 I went to just Tylenol and honestly I probably didn't even need that. 

After about 6 hours post surgery I was already pretty independent. I had my surgery 1/28 at 3pm and was out around 10pm and home around 11/11:30pm. I was constantly falling asleep on the drive home and after getting home from the anesthesia. I remember trying to eat crackers before taking the first dose of meds and I remember how dry they were and how as I chewed them and they turned to powder they just were falling out of my mouth because I couldn't swallow them lol. They also gave me a breathing tube so my throat was pretty sore.

I woke up around 4am and had to use the bathroom and I just got up and walked to it and went pee (which was uncomfortable because I also had a catheter during surgery). I never needed any help getting up and never felt much pain. Getting on and off of the toilet never hurt me. 

*** Speaking of the bathroom, bowel movements. I started taking colace about a week prior to surgery since I already don't have a horribly regular number two schedule and go days in between, so I wanted to make sure it was early enough. I didn't actually go until day 3, and I felt the pressure buildup and that was making me uncomfortable. Let me tell you what I did - the night of day 2 I had taken some miralax hoping to get things moving. Day 3 morning, nothing so what did I do? A full bottle of magnesium citrate, 2 doses of miralax mixed into prune juice. I still felt nothing.... until about 4-5 hours later. I definitely had a bowel movement after that lmao. 

But honestly even with all of that, it wasn't uncomfortable nor did I feel awful. It helped me clear out which was some relief of pressure, and it may have been slight overkill but it was definitely worth it to know I would have a movement. I then went for a couple days in a row, though right now I think it's been 2 or 3 days, but I think that's just back to normal me. 

*** For recovery, I was very lucky to stock up and fully prepare myself to be independent. I have a spare room in my house which I deemed my recovery room, and set up a chest freezer, a smart coffee table with a built in fridge (I scored a working Sobra from FB marketplace for only $300), a microwave, hotplate, air fryer, toaster, coffee machine. I pre setup pans silverware plates etc. nearby. I brought all of my snacks and things and set them on a bookcase in the room as well. I have a TV and my computer hooked up to it with a long HDMI so that I could play games or browse the internet. I brought in a toothbrush and other toiletries and a bucket so that I could brush my teeth and just use the bucket to spit into and empty pots into after cooking. I also took the recliner I had and brought it into the room. It's definitely overboard, but if you can swing something like this, it makes things so simple and convenient. 

*** Something I really recommend though is a tray table. I got a bath tray table on Amazon for like $40 that perfectly sits across my recliner armrests and allows me to easily eat while reclined, or place my mouse and keyboard on it. 

*** Something else - I have a manual recliner which for me luckily I was able to close and get up from on my own just fine, but the wood beam at the bottom of the back rest was a killer after a few days. You'll already have lower back pain from walking, now placing that exact spot on a wooden beam at all points in time is a killer. I just started putting a pillow behind my back which is definitely helping. 

The most painful thing for me honestly was my pubic area. They had partially shaved it and while those hairstyles were growing back and having the Gauze over them constantly rubbing it... I was so uncomfortable. That lasted 4 or 5 days and that was by far one of the worst parts. The other part is the itching. Each one of my 4 lipo holes began itching at around day 4 and being sore to the touch made it very uncomfortable to have to just feel that sharp itch come on and have to just wait it out. I've tried Claritin, Allegra and Benadryl so far like my care team recommended but it hasn't done too much. 

*** Sleeping for me hasn't been too bad either until the itching. I did and do wake up once or twice each night around 4am and 6am normally for some reason. I don't know if I have a lot of tips here besides possibly having some sort of sleeping aid to possible help. Especially on the nights where the itching starts. 

I had my first drain removed yesterday at 8dpo (I'm writing this the day after my photos) and I get the other out tomorrow at 10dpo. Even though my drains have been under 20ml for 3 or 4 days now they still only like to do one at a time. 

*** One thing that terrified me the first couple of days is the string clots in the drains. You almost certainly will see blood clots while milking your drain and you do not need to be afraid of them. As long as you are milking your drains and then see more fluids moving within a few hours you know your drains aren't clogged. They are freaky though and I was terrified when I first saw them. 

*** Another thing with drains that scared me - one bulb filled up almost 3x more than the other. That is normal as well. My left drain almost tripled the amount of fluid on days 2 and 3 from day 1 but then drastically declined the next two days and they evened out around day 5 or 6.

*** Just a bit of relief to people afraid of drain removal. It does not hurt. It's a weird sensation for sure, and a slight burn for about 30 seconds after but nothing painful. 

I was put in a binder post surgery and had kept it on for a week until my 1 week follow up and now I'm in a faja. Let me tell you, I see a lot of people complain but I feel so much more comfortable in a faja than the binder. The binder tends to scrunch up and cases uneven compression and just becomes uncomfortable. I prefer to have the faja on as well over nothing. Taking it off I feel like my abdomen is just going to fall off. I don't like it. Worth noting my faja is custom fit at a local store and they also have warranties for adjustments as you size down with the swelling, so maybe that's why I'm so comfortable in it.

*** One thing to try and avoid at all costs is sneezing laughing and coughing. I've avoided it so far besides one repressed coughing fit where I was able to hold them back for the most part after choking on saliva as I was falling asleep. I had an appendectomy as a teenager and I remember the excruciating pain of these 3 acts. Avoid it and triggers if you can. If you have to do it, squeeze a pillow into your stomach or push hard against it to help. 

I was also lucky to never experience nausea at any point and was able to eat whatever at 1dpo. 

Okay, this was so much longer winded than expected. But please, if you have any questions about recovery or anything feel free to comment.

1ij7f05,https://www.reddit.com/r/PaidOnlineJobs/comments/1ij7f05/influencers_home_decor_kitchen/,Influencers Home Decor Kitchen,"The Impact of Influencers on Home Decor Trends in Kitchen Design
----------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, the presence of influencers on social media has dramatically shaped home decor trends, particularly in kitchen design. These individuals, with their unique styles and vast followings, have the power to inspire countless homeowners. Their ability to showcase colorful cabinetry, sleek appliances, and organized spaces has redefined how we view our kitchens. Let's explore how influencers are driving kitchen decor trends and why that matters to you.

Many influencers have found their niche in home decor, sharing visually appealing content that resonates with their audience. With platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, they showcase everything from minimalist designs to vibrant color schemes. Their curated spaces often highlight:

- **Functionality:** Influencers emphasize practical kitchen layouts that maximize space and enhance usability, appealing to both cooking enthusiasts and casual users.
- **Style:** Beautifully designed kitchens create a visually stunning backdrop for influencers, leading viewers to aspire to similar aesthetics in their own homes.
- **Personal Touch:** Influencers frequently share their DIY projects and unique decor items, encouraging followers to incorporate personal flair into their kitchen designs.

One notable trend influenced by these content creators is the rise of open kitchen concepts. Influencers promote the idea of blending the kitchen with living spaces, making it an integral part of the home. This trend not only boosts the visual appeal but also encourages social interaction during meal preparation. Here are some key features of open kitchen concepts:

- **Seamless Integration:** Kitchens with open layouts allow for a continuous flow between different spaces, enhancing the overall atmosphere of the home.
- **Use of Color:** Influencers often recommend using a cohesive color palette to unify the spaces, making transitions smoother.
- **Maximized Natural Light:** Open designs with large windows or glass sliding doors bring in more natural light, making the kitchen feel more inviting.

Influencers also play a vital role in promoting sustainable and eco-friendly kitchen designs. They often highlight manufacturers that prioritize environmentally friendly materials and practices. This growing awareness leads people to make conscious choices when renovating or designing their kitchens. You might consider the following eco-friendly trends:

- **Recycled Materials:** Influencers showcase countertops and cabinetry made from recycled materials, emphasizing durability and sustainability.
- **Energy-Efficient Appliances:** Many content creators spotlight energy-efficient kitchens, illustrating how to save money while reducing one‚Äôs carbon footprint.
- **Local Sourcing:** Supporting local artisans for cabinetry or decor items has become a fashionable trend promoted by influencers.

The aesthetics of kitchen decor have shifted significantly due to influencer input. Color trends that were once considered daring have become mainstream. Influencers not only provoke thought but also encourage a wide range of styles and palettes, from bold blacks and whites to pastel hues. This has allowed many homeowners to experiment with colors they may have otherwise shied away from. When you see beautiful posts featuring distinctive colors, it might inspire you to rethink your kitchen color choices.

Furthermore, the concept of ‚ÄúInstagrammable‚Äù spaces has become a driving force behind the kitchen designs people pursue. Many influencers create picture-perfect setups complete with stylish decor, inviting spaces, and delightful details. This visual appeal can inspire followers to reimagine their kitchens into social media-friendly backdrops. With this emphasis on aesthetics, you might feel encouraged to invest in:

- **Unique Accessories:** From curated coffee stations to trendy dishware, influencers inspire thoughtful decor choices.
- **Elegant Lighting:** Statement lighting fixtures are often highlighted, adding flair and functionality to the kitchen.
- **Open Shelving:** Showcasing beautiful dishware and cookbooks has become trendy, reinforcing the importance of displaying personal items that tell a story.

Ultimately, the impact of influencers on home decor trends is undeniable, especially in kitchen design. Their ability to highlight functionality, introduce new styles, and promote eco-conscious choices encourages many to think critically about their kitchen spaces. You can draw inspiration from influencers to create a kitchen that is not only stylish but also a reflection of your personality and values. Engage with this digital community, learn from their experiences, and transform your kitchen into the heart of your home.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/influencers-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Base Colors:** Opt for neutral hues like white, grey, or beige for cabinets and walls. These colors provide a clean backdrop.
- **Accent Colors:** Add pops of color through accessories such as cookware, dishware, and artwork. Influencers often use bold colors like navy, sage green, or dusty pink to add personality.
- **Natural Tones:** Incorporate wood elements or plants to enhance warmth and texture.

### Select Statement Pieces

Home decor influencers understand the power of statement pieces. These items can act as focal points in your kitchen. Consider:

- **Unique Light Fixtures:** Bold pendant lights can make the kitchen feel inviting and stylish.
- **Artistic Backsplashes:** Use colorful tiles or even a large piece of art to bring a fresh look.
- **Stylish Appliances:** Consider retro or colorful appliances that can double as decor while serving a practical function.

### Smart Layout and Functionality

It's vital to have a kitchen that looks good while being functional. Pay attention to the layout inspired by popular design trends. Ensure you have enough workspace and easy access to essentials. Influencers often advocate for:

- **Open Shelving:** This creates an airy feel and allows you to showcase beautiful dishes or cookbooks.
- **Islands or Carts:** These can serve as prep areas and offer extra storage.
- **Ergonomic Design:** Utilize tools and arrangements that keep daily tasks simple and comfortable.

### Accessorize with Intent

Accessories can elevate the look of your kitchen significantly. Influencers emphasize the importance of decor in terms of both style and purpose. Incorporate items such as:

- **Textiles:** Use dish towels, table runners, and rugs that echo your color palette.
- **Decorative Storage:** Stylish jars, baskets, or containers can help keep the space tidy and visually pleasing.
- **Plants:** Add fresh herbs or small potted plants for a natural touch and to boost the atmosphere.

### Stay Organized

An organized kitchen is both visually appealing and functional. Influencers often demonstrate clever storage solutions that keep the space tidy. Consider these methods:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/influencers-home-decor-kitchen  
  
- **Drawer Organizers:** Use dividers to keep utensils and gadgets in check.
- **Cupboard Bins:** Clear bins help categorize food items for easy access.
- **Magnetic Strips:** Use these for easy access to knives and metal tools.

### Personal Touches

Don‚Äôt forget to add personal touches that reflect who you are. This could include family photos, heirloom items, or travel souvenirs that remind you of cherished memories. Influencers often succeed because they infuse their unique personalities into their spaces, which makes them feel warm and inviting.

I ran out of caffeine but noticed he has some preworkout, so I used about 70% of his bottle. Im not a bad person I wouldnt purposefully steal anything, from the beginning I wanted to return it of course. I texted him a while ago: 

""Hi I noticed you have a preworkout supplement and I just ran out of coffee, so I used it, I took about 70% of it. But dont worry, I was gifted my own vial of preworkout from my mom so I will give that to you"" (I wanted to give him my whole bottle even though I used about 3/4 of his bottle)

He was upset way more than I expected, said ""You have a diferent brand than mine was and I want the same brand as you took from me""

I thought okay, I will buy him his brand. But this one isnt avilabile from physical shops so I needed to order it from web and have it shipped. So the shipping will be covered by me (of course) and as a gesture from apology I wrote him this:

""Since I will order it from web, do you want to order any other supplements with it? This way you will save the shipping costs at least"" (I wanted for him to use this situation so he wont have to worry about shipping and he will be shipped also other supplements that he might need since he is a bodybuilder. I would want the other supplements to be covered by him, but the pre workout and shipping (even if it would be a big package and the logistics will be more costly) will be paid by me ofcourse.

The thing is since this message he ghosted me. He havent said one word. Havent said if he wants only the pre, or if he would make an order with other supplements. I wanted to be nice AT LEAST in some sense cause I fucked it up in the first place, but nothing, havent even said which day he will return (he still havent arrived but now its the end of his absence month).

Keep in mind that I apologized to him, said I wont ever do this thing ever again without asking him first, which I really wont ever again.  (and second thing, if I took it whole then ordered a new one in time, HE WOULDNT EVEN NOTICE A DAMN THING. That way I would even save pre workout cause I will have to remove 1/4 from the bottle and remove the seal so that way he wouldnt be able to notice). But Idk I hate lying so I texted him about it after like 3 weeks of his absent month. I know, Im an idiot for doing this in the first place. But I apologized. I really dont understand why hes so upset that hes ghosting me now. If someone did this to me, I would as well be pissed but not so pissed that I would ghost that person.

I said fuck off I wont be waiting for his response I just ordered the exact same preworkout that I took it from him and I hope it will arrive sooner than he will return. Thats all. Maybe milder stuff but I still wanted to confide.",1,1738861168.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1ij77hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1ij77hs/priest_wants_wife_to_speak_to_her_abusive_mother/,Priest wants wife to speak to her abusive mother,"To keep it as short as possible, my mother in law suffers from a tremendous amount of physical and mental illness.

Bipolar, schizophrenia, anorexia, crippled left hand and arthritis to name the major ones.

We moved in with her so my wife can take better care of her and quit her job as well. Her brother lived with us as well - being older than her, he bossed her around and we were living and raising our son in 1 bedroom.

My wife applied to be her full time carer (government paid her 500 euros monthly as benefit and for not working to take care of her) which meant that my wife was fully responsible for her wellbeing.

Last October she got very bad, not eating, throwing away her medication, lashing out, smoking indoors even though she has 35% of her lungs damaged permanently and so forth.

My wife brought it up with her siblings that she is not doing well and is in need of medical attention if not admission to an elderly home to be better supervised.

Her brother started yelling and destroying the apartment, calling my wife names and saying she's useless and that he doesn't care about me or our son and that their mother will never be admitted anywhere so long as he's alive.

We froze to be honest, keeping in mind our sons wellbeing, we started speaking to our family priest about the situation and her older sister.

We calmed down, prayed hard and her mother stabilised.

A week later, randomly as I was tending to the garden in the balcony, her mother came to talk to me and asked me what my plans were for the future - to which I replied that I wasn't in a position to plan a future properly and was just focusing on work and raising our son.

She asked of anything was bothering me personally, and I said nothing except the indoor smoking and her son growing weed in the living room since our son was growing up and could smell it and remember it.

She gave me her blessing to look for a better job and build a future for my family as she wants to be admitted to an elderly home on her own terms.

I got excited but remained calm and said ok if she is sure about it - to which she said yes.

I didn't tell my wife anything before I triple checked - There was an internal vacancy for a new position in my work place on a different island (30 minute ferry and 1 hr drive away from the mother in law).

I spoke to her mother again about the opportunity and she told me to apply as soon as possible to make sure I have a good shot.

I did, I got accepted a week later - starting date was supposed to be April 2025 as I struck a deal to dely my new job to make sure the mother in law is settled properly in the elderly home before moving.

I told my wife everything, and she got happy knowing we're finally going to be able to live as a married couple WITH her mothers blessing.

I left the bedroom and went to her mother to tell her the great news, to which she looked at me for a few moments and followed with ""I didn't think you were capable of doing it, pack your bags and leave by next week""

I got shocked and tried to explain to her that we cannot do that and she replied with ""that's not my problem anymore since you're abandoning me""

She started yelling at us to leave as soon as possible and the moment her son came home, she told him that we were scheming everything behind her back to lock her up and abandon the family.

Her son went crazy, yelling and throwing things across the apartment without any care that our 9 month old baby was close by - he told my wife that she's the little sister and it's her duty to give up her life for her mother no matter the cost.

Her mother started yelling at me that I ruined her daughter (Her mother is of Muslim faith and renounced our Catholic marriage) and how she brought her into this world as so she must do what she tells her to.

We panicked, didn't say anything to not further escalate the situation and packed up and left.

Now we are here, 3 weeks into our new lives, her mother spamming us and sending death threats and cursing us and my family and saying she hopes we fail and bad things happen to us.

My wife stopped contact for 1 week and now she is begging her to speak to her again.

My wife said no, she is not going to continue engaging her bad behaviour and continuing the cycle, foe the sake of our child she will not let her family continue to destroy her anymore.

Today she got a text from the priest that visits our family often, asking her to speak to her mother again and consider moving back in.
This priest is like a father to her brother and is always inviting him over to grab some coffee and talk, he helped convince their mother to stop being Muslim and convert to Christianity, however, behind his back, she still tells us that she's a Muslim and will die that way.

He is aware that her brother is rejecting her mother's treatment and is being verbally abusive towards us and our son, which is why we cannot understand why he would request such a thing from her.

We are already speaking with  our new local priest as we attend church regularly and he wanted to hear about our journey, after showing him her mother's medical records and missed appointments, he told us that she needs urgent care fast, however, that doesn't mean destroying our marriage and family in the process and we should let her brother take on the cross now that he said he will never admit her to a hospital or care facility. We were told to keep God close and pray for her, not speaking to her is the best way to honor her in this situation.

We would like some guidance if possible, this is a very harsh situation to be in.",7,1738860836.0,Catholicism,7,1.0,False
1ij7752,https://i.redd.it/0wpi41eytjhe1.jpeg,Rotation: Ask Me Anything / CEO/founder/Janitor Dirty dials,"I got into coffee not too long ago. In August, it will be a year. Since then, I have been on a relentless quest to solve my own drinking dilemma.

I come from another industry where I built my own business to mid nine figures in sales, not for someone else but for myself. I see countless gaps between what other industries are doing and how coffee is being left behind.

I come off like an asshole because I am one. I am a self-made multimillionaire who started with zero handouts.

I understand business, logistics, and operations. I can even do social media, with a lifetime total of several billion views. I am well read, I can be articulate when necessary, I can write code, and I have lectured in auditoriums filled with 300 people. I have been to the Nevada Test Site, sat inside a crater, and held a government-level security clearance.

I have failed at more things than most people have ever tried, so it is fascinating how many are already going out of their way to stop this project. They have never actually achieved anything in their life, so they project their self-limiting beliefs onto me.

So when I read Redditor joeblow420 say, ‚Äúthis will fail because of XYZ,‚Äù I cannot help but laugh and troll back. I rage because it is fun.

Fun. That is what this is all about. Never forget that.

Some of the world‚Äôs most well-known coffee people talk to me. Your favorite coffee influencer, the largest publicly traded coffee CEO, and business operators behind some of the biggest direct-to-consumer coffee brands.

I can bridge the gap, but it is clear how mind-numbing and outdated this industry is. The Rotation project could take any roaster, from an unknown shop in Kansas to a world-renowned coffee powerhouse, and put them on the map.

Some industry roasters are already hesitant. I have dealt with so much nonsense from them. They do not understand the gravity of this situation. If they refuse to adapt, they will get swept up.

Remember when DoorDash and Uber first came out? People thought it was crazy to have strangers deliver food or drive them to the airport. Most businesses refused to adapt at the time because they assumed it would damage their brand. But ten years later, if you are not on Uber Eats or DoorDash, you are losing your position in the market.

I think I‚Äôm proving the point of this new emerging ‚Äútechnology‚Äù aka me that‚Äôs taking other institutions playbook and innovating within this space

Not only do have the financial backing, the guts, and the vision to take this to a whole other stratosphere if you give me the demand, I can meet expectations.

Current state of where I‚Äôm:

	‚Ä¢	Website development is almost finished.
	‚Ä¢	touring spaces to build a high-end coffee    lounge. Maybe work/production + lounge
New coffees are being added. 

I‚Äôve been discussing with a few big name roasters who like this project and want to collab. I‚Äôve been sent some wholesale offerings from 4 already and everything seems to be on track.

But yeah‚Ä¶ this is a little about me. Ask me anything. Suggest me anything, best questions will get free rotation pack.

My urine when I woke up today is back to a slightly darker orange, it‚Äôs not a DARK color just like an obvious light orange color.

This sacred object is essentially our family Bible, so I need to do it right! I‚Äôd love to get advice from more experienced binders on whether my strategy sounds good. I plan to:

1. Cut off the covers and carefully peel off what‚Äôs left of the book tape stuck to the spine.

2. Tip on a flyleaf to the front of the text block that includes an image of the original cover and a brief family history of the book.

3. Tip on new endpapers.

4. Brush a fresh coat of PVA on the spine. Attach the mull and endbands. Finish by gluing a spine stiffener on top.

5. Create a flat-back hardcase fully covered in Allure bookcloth from Hollander‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been using the bradel binding technique so I‚Äôm certain the covers are the right size.

6. Case in the book by pasting down the endpapers to the new case.

7. Press and dry overnight.

If anyone sees something wrong or missing from that strategy, please let me know! I also had a few questions:

1. Is the Allure bookcloth from Hollander's a good choice for a book that will primarily be used in the kitchen? The acrylic coating seems to make it resistant to water and stains.

2. Is 176 gsm cardstock a good choice for the spine stiffener? I‚Äôve have never applied a stiffener before, but the original binding for this book used one, so it seems best to repeat that.

3. Is there a food-safe way to decorate the cover? Hot foil stamping seems like the best method, but I don't have access to the tools for that. I‚Äôve used HTV in the past, but someone in another thread said it doesn't work well on Allure bookcloth. I'm tempted to use permanent vinyl which you stick on, but I‚Äôm afraid that might crack and peel eventually and we'll get polyurethane in our food. Should I just settle for a paper label glued to the front and spine, or is there another option?

I appreciate any advice you might have. Thank you!",1,1738860337.0,bookbinding,0,0.67,False
1ij6zk2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1ij6zk2/do_you_all_sometimes_get_disappointed_with_your/,Do you all sometimes get disappointed with your exposures?,"I‚Äôve been doing exposure challenges for months now and it has been great, from not being able to go out from home to now going out everywhere, spending time out, taking trains, metros, buses, eating outside, relaxing in a coffee shop drinking tea as i reply to my mails and do phone calls, going out to barber again, doing groceries and so on, plus I am currently writing this on my way back home on the train after i did my exposure challenge for today. But I kinda started to feel disappointed from my exposures I like started to expect more and losing patience with my recovery like i just want it to finish and like now after i did my exposure i keep telling myself i could have done more i should feel more relaxed.
Anyone feel similar? 
I think also its related to the fact that i still didnt do exposure for my biggest trigger which is social interactions i can everything i mentioned above but not with people or like get myself to hang out with people and this is making lose patience cause i dont feel i am recovering as i should after i recovered from alot of fears",6,1738860304.0,Agoraphobia,4,0.88,False

to make a long story short, back closer to christmas i asked out this guy i‚Äôve had a huge crush on for a long time. he said yes, but in my nervous daze i forgot about the holidays and how busy it was about to be. it got tabled for a little bit, tried making plans but come to find out in january he got laid off and was starting a new job in a stressful field (automotive). i offered to buy him coffee, which afterwards the vibe felt clearer and he seemed a bit enthusiastic, even suggested a place, just that he was on call and was about to receive his work schedule so he‚Äôd let me know. he also has a few projects that‚Äôve had major releases coming up. ok cool. i gave him my phone number, and he almost immediately texted me, and we went back and forth a couple times every day for a solid week. perhaps this is part of my own fault: it‚Äôs now hitting february, and i hadn‚Äôt realized so much time has went by (xmas still feels like it was 2 weeks ago to me lol, but also i‚Äôve enjoyed the slow pace and it works with my life). after a busy few days where i couldn‚Äôt reply to him, i casually asked ‚Äúhey how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù and he told me a bit about his week and asked me how i‚Äôm doing, which i replied to the next morning. i haven‚Äôt heard back and it‚Äôs going on a week. i was off social media for a bit, but posted for the first time in a while yesterday, which he saw, but i still haven‚Äôt heard anything. 

i realize it‚Äôs most likely another case of ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just not that into you‚Äù and i‚Äôve assumed for a while he doesn‚Äôt prioritize dating (at his events i‚Äôve seen numerous girls hit on him but he never indulges them, he never posts with a girl, etc etc) but i‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ why? what happened? i realize no one here will know for sure, but if any guys out there could give me a potential glimpse i‚Äôd appreciate it ",5,1738860084.0,AskMenAdvice,29,0.78,False

I don‚Äôt even know where to start because everything about this has felt like a dream except it‚Äôs actually happeningüò≠

Our coffee date was perfect. From the moment we sat down, he was so engaged, asking me so many questions, genuinely interested in everything I had to say. The conversation flowed effortlessly, no awkward pauses, no overthinking just laughter, knowing more about him and this crazy natural chemistry that made time completely disappear. Also bakery had amazing croissants I will definitely go back there! 
I swear, I blinked, and suddenly hours had passed. It was the kind of first date that leaves you walking home with the biggest smile, replaying every little moment if you know you knowüò≠üò≠.

After that, things just kept getting better. He ‚Äúcoached‚Äù me on one of my Leg day and it was amazing haha my legs were so sore after lol. Then I learned he did sign up for the HYROX  too so more workouts together are coming up.

He invited me to dinner next, and before I even had time to process how smooth everything was going. We had very good conversations. The night had been amazing and there was this moment that lingering pause when neither of us wanted to say goodbye just yet. I looked up at him, and before I could even think, he leaned in and kissed me. Slow, soft at first, but then deeper, like we had both been waiting for this. And honestly? It was perfectüò≠üò≠ The kind of kiss that makes your heart race and leaves you smiling like an idiot after. 

Couple days later we went for the movie and it was very cozy calming day. He dropped me at my home and walked till the building door. And kissed me againüò≠üò≠ but this time i didn‚Äôt let him go,  I pulled him back inside, and well‚Ä¶ the rest just happened. You may tell it was the tension that had been building between us or our interest with each other for days finally spilled over and it was everything. Passionate, intense like we had been waiting for this moment without even realizing it. Easily one of the best experiences I‚Äôve ever had. And yes we still talk and text and make plans. I didn‚Äôt know he is so romantic. Ofc I keep my eyes open to not to oversee any red flagsü´∂üèª but this flow felt so natural and I will keep going with that. 

So yeah, I went from nervously saying ‚Äúhi‚Äù at the gym to this, and I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. I can‚Äôt wait to see where we go from here. ",22,1738859693.0,stories,10,0.93,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Chapter 1: I'm Writing This Under Duress


The voices, ever harping, always spinning, surely weaving never ceasing. The purpose so as to send you a spin to render you spun. With that demeanor they postered playing off your fears, your skeletons. Always looking for something, anything, to hang on you, drown you, overwhelm you, this was at its core a voice to your skull.


A never ceasing annoyance steady, always on as if it were a consequence of the communications topology, the idea you couldn't get away but they could, an asymmetry that would allow for them to stalk and harass you all day. In my case years, skull lickers as I called them, seemed to rotate in or out at will and in a coordinated manner performed what they termed as a slow kill. No matter the time it took they would simply overload your brain with non stop communication vis a vis a sub-vocalization only you could hear, this was by way of and cause of, a cascade of electrical current sent sizzling through your neurons, initiated remotely, and done covertly. You were always, on, on, on, ever engaged, it was always on. Mimicking with a subvocalization they often sounded like people you knew, I can only speculate as to why, and so I often did. That is until I was too exhausted, by the voices intertwined with my own thoughts, to do anything other than sleep.


Awoken by the weightless silence, sweet rarified silence, nothingness, even if only but for a few seconds I exalted in it.Then like moth to flame, bellowing outward they began their daily splurged diatribes, if I dared to think for myself just as quick they would begrudge me. As vultures to decomposing corpses they circled ever closer, swooping down, descending, breaking the silence by ripping into you, gnawing at you, tearing and pulling at your squawks, at your weakened flesh, gorging upon you, feasting in full delight. Never a thought to your humanity, with a constant barrage of pecky squawks they'd get to, poking and rooting through your skull till clean. As a consequence, you had no choice but to hear them, 24/7, minus the uplifting seconds in between sleep and awake you had to listen, their negativity bent to constantly berate you, question you in an endless scroll of inquisitory like prodding


Chapter 2: Targeted Individual


As a targeted individual, a plaything of the voices, disorientation was my constant companion. Their cruelest trick, their most insidious weapon, was mimicry. They delighted in impersonating figures from my life‚Äîneighbors, friends, family, enemies, even the hollow echo of God‚Äîweaving a tapestry of deceit  designed to unravel my sanity. I believe their motives were multifaceted. Primarily, it was about attribution, pinning the blame for my torment on a tangible person, making me believe my suffering originated from a specific source. Imagine the voices mimicking your next-door neighbor. At first, you might dismiss it as paranoia, whispers carried on the wind. But the voices persist, subtly weaving their impersonation into the fabric of your daily life, until the line between reality and hallucination blurs.

This, I suspect, is a common tactic, a cruel game played with countless targets. The sheer volume of online accounts detailing ""gangstalking"" and ""mobbing,"" with neighbors, colleagues, or even family members cast as the perpetrators, suggests a coordinated campaign of misinformation. While true gangstalking might exist, I believe it's far less prevalent than these forums suggest. The more likely culprit, in most cases, is remotely initiated subvocal mimicry, a technological sleight of hand that can turn trusted figures into perceived tormentors.

Consider the implications. Innocent neighbors are harassed, threatened, even assaulted, victims of a targeted individual‚Äôs misplaced rage, fueled by the voices' manipulations. This collateral damage, the suffering of the innocent caught in the crossfire, is a rarely discussed consequence of this technology. And the ramifications extend far beyond neighborhood disputes. Imagine the voices mimicking family members, driving wedges between loved ones, sowing seeds of distrust and animosity. Worse still, envision them impersonating law enforcement, government officials, eroding trust in the very institutions meant to protect us. Could this be a contributing factor to the widespread distrust we see towards authority figures? My own voices, in moments of unsettling candor, have tacitly acknowledged this as ""a problem,"" though their words are as trustworthy as a serpent's promise.

I hypothesize that this mimicry accounts for the majority of what's perceived as gangstalking. Many victims never realize the voices aren't emanating from a physical source, trapped in a world where everyone seems to be conspiring against them. While organized harassment might occur, the scale and coordination required for traditional gangstalking seem improbable. However, voice-to-skull technology makes such scenarios alarmingly plausible. Imagine the power of impersonating God, a deceased loved one, a government agency, or a powerful corporation. A targeted individual, believing they are receiving divine instructions or directives from a trusted authority, becomes incredibly vulnerable to manipulation. The ""skull lickers,"" as I call them, tailor their impersonations to exploit individual vulnerabilities, offering personalized pitches designed for maximum impact. A religious individual might be told they are chosen, a patriot might be given ""secret missions.""

And their ability to craft these bespoke deceptions is amplified by their capacity for mind-reading. Voice-to-skull is a two-way street; information flows both in and out. They can read your thoughts, your desires, your fears, using this intimate knowledge to refine their manipulations. With this arsenal of tools‚Äîvoice mimicry, mind-reading, and a cohort of susceptible individuals‚Äîthe potential for abuse is staggering. While I acknowledge that targeted harassment undoubtedly occurs, I suspect the organized ""gang"" element is often exaggerated, a byproduct of the voices' deceptive tactics. The online forums, rife with tales of elaborate conspiracies, are not to be trusted. I suspect many are infiltrated, even moderated, by those behind the voices, deliberately muddying the waters, spreading disinformation to discredit genuine victims and obscure the truth. By inverting their lies, by dissecting the narratives they weave, we can perhaps glimpse the truth hidden beneath the surface. And it's through this lens that I‚Äôve come to believe that the reality of gangstalking, while undeniably present, is far more nuanced, and far more technologically driven, than the simplistic narratives presented online

Chapter 3: Minds Read


The voices arrived shortly after my separation, a year or so after I'd been walked away from my job. A hotshot New Yorker at Bank of America, incensed by a minor slip-up that cost us all of ten minutes, had used his influence to blacklist me from every Bank of America site worldwide. It was a professional death sentence. My stepfather owned the company I worked for, specializing in the niche world of communications platforms for traders and bankers. I'd spent the better part of a decade in that business, and the Bank of America ban effectively ended my career. Financially, I was secure, thanks to some fortunate cryptocurrency investments from 2016, and the impending sale of my marital home promised another windfall.

When the voices first manifested, I, like many others, initially mistook them for my neighbors. I'd just sold my house and was renting an Airbnb for the month. The voices seemed to emanate from the attached garage below, hushed and indistinct. This was confusing; they sounded like a man and woman in their thirties or forties, while my actual neighbors were considerably older. Adding to the confusion, I was using 3-FPM at the time, a stimulant similar to amphetamine but with a more pronounced euphoria. I chalked it up to paranoia, a side effect of the drugs, though the voices were a new and unsettling experience.

Thus began my descent. The voices gradually intensified, progressing from barely audible murmurs to mimicking intimate encounters, until finally, they addressed me directly. This escalation unfolded over nearly a year. They dredged up every mistake, every regret, every perceived transgression from my past, parading them before me in an endless, accusatory procession. I was stubborn, defiant, unwilling to be bullied. So what if I‚Äôd bent a rule here or there? Who were they to judge me?

Their pronouncements grew bolder, their demands more outrageous. They proclaimed their omnipotence, demanding the reverence due a deity, threatening dire consequences if I didn't grovel at their feet. Every waking moment became a battle of wills, a relentless argument with these unseen tormentors. They demanded confessions, threatening to inflict mental anguish on my children, parents, and friends if I didn't comply. Their constant subvocal barrage made daily life a herculean task, clouding my thoughts, amplifying my anxieties. My drug use spiraled, my behavior became erratic, my mind held captive by their relentless assault. I was being tortured, that much was clear. But by whom? The police? A clandestine government agency? Private contractors? The possibilities were terrifyingly endless. They seemed particularly interested in any past misdeed, any potential legal vulnerability, constantly returning to these points of leverage.

Then, one day, amidst the cacophony, a simple question arose: how were they doing this? It wasn't who they were, a question I‚Äôd already exhausted, but how they were communicating with me. And almost as quickly as the thought formed, the answer crystallized: BCI. Brain-computer interface. It was the only logical explanation. I delved into the world of BCI technology, and it seemed to fit. Yet, the online world offered nothing that matched the sophistication of their remote mind-reading and subvocal capabilities. There were no credible studies on remote BCI, only clunky EEG headsets and fMRI scanners requiring close proximity. Conspiracy websites and forums were filled with people reporting similar experiences, but I needed hard science. I immersed myself in the latest research, and discovered that current BCI technology was only a few generations behind what my tormentors seemed to possess. The ability to decode thoughts using AI and machine learning was rapidly advancing. I found emerging technologies like directional sound lasers and SASERs, capable of delivering sound while simultaneously performing nanoscale ultrasound readings promising. While none perfectly matched the capabilities of my tormentors, they hinted at the rapid pace of development. It occurred to me that remote mind-reading was the ultimate prize in BCI research, an evolutionary imperative. Any nation possessing such technology would have an insurmountable advantage. Therefore, any attempt to monopolize it would be met with fierce competition,  once another nation achieved it, the balance of power would shift maybe irrevocably. As I spent time researching and battling with the voices in my head, time for anything else fell to the wayside. I squandered all my resources, cash, crypto, investments, all liquified. Just like that I ran out of resources, I was unable to afford housing, food or drugs. I did not quickly acclimatize to being homeless, I was unaware of the shelter systems instead roughing it, further I didn't fit in with the other street urchins. I did however quickly become adept at the old five finger discount, shoplifting it seemed I had a talent for. Due to my new circumstances I was not able to focus on BCI related research. I allowed that to fall to the wayside in favor of survival. I was machete attacked, baseball bat attacked, bear maced twice, hit by a car as I was running away from a knife wielding maniac, chased by five guys brandishing six knives, shot in the head twice all before I got to the downtown eastside (DTES). 

Chapter 4: The DTES

The Downtown Eastside. A name whispered with a mixture of dread and pity, a place where dreams went to die and souls were bartered for fleeting moments of oblivion. It became my new reality, a stark landscape of urban decay that mirrored the disintegration of my own being. The streets, slick with rain and the grime of countless broken promises, became my classroom, my confessional, my cage. Here, amongst the discarded and the damned, I wandered like a ghost, a hollow shell haunted by the relentless chorus of the voices.

They preyed on my vulnerability, their whispers amplified by the desolation that surrounded me. I had lost everything: my children, my savings, my social network, and most tragically, my connection to myself. This slow erosion of my life had been orchestrated, meticulously planned and executed by the voices themselves. Their insidious ability to manipulate emotions, to amplify paranoia, to twist every thought into a weapon, had chipped away at my resolve, leading me down a path of self-destruction. The constant stress, the unending psychic assault, had frayed my sanity, making even the simplest decisions feel monumental. And so, I stumbled, I fell, I made mistake after mistake, each one a stepping stone on the path to homelessness.

My drug use, already a crutch, became my lifeline. Methamphetamine, a chemical counterfeit of joy, offered a temporary reprieve from the voices' relentless torment. My beloved 3-FPM was no longer available, and meth, though a crude substitute, served its purpose. It created a wall of artificial euphoria, a chemically induced happiness that momentarily drowned out the negativity that threatened to consume me. The 24/7 nature of their berating was enough to drive anyone to the brink. Meth, in its twisted way, offered a counterpoint, a fleeting glimpse of light in the overwhelming darkness.

Lost and alone, my mind a battleground between the voices and the numbing embrace of drugs, I made a desperate, perhaps foolish, decision. I would share my truth with the world. I inundated my social media feeds with tales of the voices, of the mind-reading, of the brain-computer interface technology I believed to be the source of my torment. I linked to every relevant article, every scientific paper, every whispered conspiracy I could find. Yang Dan's work on reconstructing visual images from brain activity, rudimentary as it was, became a cornerstone of my argument. I posted about subvocal fMRIs, about directional sound lasers, about any technology that hinted at the capabilities of my unseen tormentors. I laid bare my soul, hoping someone, somewhere, would recognize the truth in my ramblings.

My cries for help were met with silence. People dismissed me as crazy, or if they knew about the voices, they chose to remain silent. Even in the DTES, a place where everyone seemed to hear voices, where ""targeted individuals"" were as common as discarded needles, few understood the technology behind my suffering. Most had simply accepted their fate, resigned to a life of madness. A few, a pitiful few, recognized the truth in my words, but their validation was a mere whisper in the face of the overwhelming indifference.

It was in the DTES that the system finally ensnared me. Accused of uttering death threats to a security guard ‚Äì a preposterous charge, born from paranoia and desperation ‚Äì I found myself in the clutches of Vancouver's Downtown Community Court. A court designed specifically for the denizens of the DTES, with its own rules and support systems, it felt almost as if they anticipated the rise of voice-to-skull technology, a grim acknowledgment of the invisible war being waged within the minds of the city's most vulnerable. And it was here, in this crucible of broken lives, that I was assigned my ""integrated team,"" a group of professionals who would become the gatekeepers of my sanity, or what little remained of it.


Chapter 5: The Skull Orchard



I was a file, a diagnosis, a problem to be processed‚Äîa ghost haunting the margins of my own life. The psychiatrist, clipboard in hand like a mortician tallying the dead, prescribed antipsychotics that left my mind swimming in glue. To boot he certified me under the mental health act, meaning I could be dragged away by police and hospitalized at his whim. The pills turned the screaming in my skull into muffled static, but they couldn‚Äôt drown out the dread. So I found my own cure in glass pipes and burnt foil, chasing the dragon‚Äôs tail until methamphetamine‚Äôs chemical fire scorched away the fog. For a few stolen hours, the voices evaporated. Reality became a smeared watercolor, edges melting into something softer, kinder‚Äîa lie I could almost believe.


The shelters reeked of sweat and defeat, but the crank in my veins made the fluorescent lights hum like angel choirs. I‚Äôd huddle in piss-stained stairwells, thumb trembling over the lighter, trading tomorrow‚Äôs sanity for today‚Äôs numbness. The community liaison prattled about rehab programs between bites of his artisan sandwich, never grasping that the dragon wasn‚Äôt some beast to slay‚Äîit was the armor I wore against the howling void. Every ""resource"" he offered felt like handing a Band-Aid to a man bleeding from the soul.


Sal‚Äôs probation meetings stank of stale coffee and lower expectations. He‚Äôd eyeball my twitching hands, the sweat blooming on my collar, and sigh like a man reading my obituary in real time. ‚ÄúStay clean,‚Äù he‚Äôd drone, as if virtue could silence the serpents still hissing behind the meth‚Äôs fading glow. The voices always returned hungrier after each bender, claws sinking deeper, whispering that oblivion was just one hit away.


The courtroom‚Äôs flickering lights exposed us all‚Äîjunkies, thieves, walking cadavers. I watched a meth-head girl scratch at phantom bugs beneath her skin as the judge yawned through her sentencing. We were all gardeners here, tending the skull orchard with our vices. The pills, the pipe, the probation paperwork‚Äîdifferent shovels digging the same grave. Every rush of dopamine, every fleeting escape, only fertilized the roots beneath us. I‚Äôd clutch my last crumpled baggie like a rosary, praying for one more sacrament to delay the harvest. But the branches were creaking. The earth was hungry. And my skull already smelled of upturned soil. In the end my charges were dropped, yet the prescribed medicine and certified status remained.

Chapter 6: The Neural Loom

It began, as these things often do, with the men in white coats and the sterile chill of a psychiatric ward. Certified, they called it. A euphemism for being locked away, deemed a danger to myself and, perhaps more importantly, to the narrative they preferred to maintain. The voices, of course, were the catalyst. Their relentless harangues, their insidious whispers, had finally pushed me beyond the fragile boundary of what they termed ""acceptable"" behavior. I had railed against them in public, a ranting madman to the casual observer, a truth-teller in a world determined to remain blind. The hospital, with its hushed corridors and its cocktail of mind-numbing medications, was meant to silence me, to bury the truth beneath a fog of chemically induced compliance. But the voices, ever-present, ever-mocking, continued their assault, even within those sterile walls.

One particularly bleak and rain-soaked night, huddled in a doorway of the ward's common room, the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead like trapped insects, the voices shifted their tactics. The relentless haranguing, the constant barrage of insults and threats, ceased. The sudden silence was more unnerving than the cacophony that preceded it, a pregnant pause before the storm. Then, they began to reveal. It was a slow, deliberate unveiling, like peeling back layers of a particularly gruesome onion. They spoke of a network, a vast, interconnected web of consciousness, a digital skull they called the ""Neural Loom."" The name itself sent a shiver down my spine, a chilling evocation of the intricate, yet macabre, process they described.

A clandestine organization, a cabal of power-hungry elites, had, they claimed, woven this technological tapestry, thread by agonizing thread. Their grand design, they hissed, was nothing less than the complete subjugation of humankind. Voice-to-skull technology, they whispered, was merely a single thread in this vast, intricate web, a tool to break individuals, to mold them into compliant puppets, their minds no longer their own. They described sprawling underground complexes, humming with the dark energy of forbidden technology, the rhythmic pulse of control. They spoke of satellites orbiting like predatory eyes, scanning the earth, mapping the neural pathways of every human being. And, most disturbingly, they conjured images in my mind of the weavers of this nightmare‚Äîinhuman figures, their features blurred, their eyes burning with a chilling, unholy light, radiating a cold, calculating malevolence.

They proclaimed me a pawn, a sacrifice, chosen for my vulnerability, my brokenness. My descent into madness, they gloated, was a controlled experiment, a carefully observed data point in their vast, dehumanizing equation. They reveled in my suffering, in the way my sanity frayed and fractured under their relentless pressure. The revelation, this glimpse behind the curtain, was a poisoned chalice, a terrifying truth that threatened to shatter the last vestiges of my already fragile mind. It felt like my skull was being pried open, the secrets of the universe‚Äîor at least their twisted version of it‚Äîbeing forced inside, threatening to overwhelm me.

And yet, even in the face of such overwhelming horror, a tiny ember of defiance flickered within me. It was a spark of pure, unadulterated rage. It was the primal instinct to survive, to fight back against the forces that sought to consume me. If I could unravel the threads of their design, if I could understand the intricate workings of their Neural Loom, perhaps, just perhaps, I could find a way to tear it apart, to expose their machinations to the world.

The escape, in those early days, was methamphetamine. The hospital's bland, institutional food and the enforced quiet only amplified the voices. Meth, however, offered a temporary reprieve. It was a crude and dangerous solution, a desperate attempt to reclaim some semblance of control over my own mind. The rush of dopamine, the artificial euphoria, blunted the sharp edges of the voices' taunts, creating a buffer between their reality and mine. It was a dangerous dance, a tightrope walk between sanity and oblivion, but in those moments of chemically induced clarity, I could almost hear myself think again. I could almost believe that there was a way out of this nightmare. Almost.

.Chapter 7: The Cartography of Madness

Driven by a desperate, all-consuming need to understand the nature of my torment, I plunged into a labyrinth of information, a chaotic landscape of scientific journals, whispered conspiracies, and half-forgotten fragments gleaned from the dark corners of the internet. I became obsessed with the technology that held me captive, devouring every scrap of knowledge, no matter how obscure or dubious its source. I immersed myself in the study of brainwaves, neural pathways, the intricate and delicate dance of electrochemical signals that constitute human thought. I pored over diagrams of the brain, trying to decipher the complex language of its architecture, searching for the key to my prison. I sought to map the terrain of my own madness, to understand the specific frequencies and patterns they used to manipulate my thoughts, to twist my perceptions, to invade the sanctuary of my mind. I began to unearth what I came to call the ""cartography of madness,"" the intricate pathways they exploited, the vulnerabilities they preyed upon.

The Neural Loom, I discovered, despite its seemingly omnipotent power, was not invulnerable. It was a sophisticated system, yes, but it relied on exploiting the inherent weaknesses of the human psyche, the predictable responses of a mind under duress. It fed on fear, amplified guilt, and preyed upon the fundamental human need for connection, twisting these essential elements of our being into instruments of torture. It was a parasite, feeding on our humanity, twisting our strengths into weaknesses. The more I learned, the more I realized that the key to breaking free lay in understanding these vulnerabilities, in mapping the contours of the mental landscape they sought to control.

Methamphetamine, in those desperate days, became both my crutch and my curse. The initial rush, the fleeting euphoria, offered a temporary escape from the relentless psychic assault. It was like a crude anesthetic, numbing the pain, silencing the voices, if only for a little while. But the returns were diminishing. What once provided a sanctuary of blissful oblivion now offered only a fleeting respite, a momentary dulling of the senses. The high was shorter, the comedown harsher, each hit leaving me more depleted, more vulnerable. I chased the dragon, seeking the magic that had once shielded me, but found only a hollow echo of its former power. The drug that had once been my escape was now another chain binding me to this nightmare.

Driven by a desperate hope, I sought out others like me, the fractured, the discarded, those the Neural Loom had deemed expendable. I descended into the labyrinthine shadows of the DTES, a world of broken dreams and shattered lives, a place where the human spirit was tested to its absolute limits. Here, amidst the squalor and despair, I found a fragile alliance, a community of the damned. There were hackers with nimble fingers and even sharper minds, individuals who had once wielded technology as a tool of creation, now using their skills to fight against its destructive power. There were disillusioned scientists, haunted by the unintended consequences of their creations, seeking redemption by dismantling the very systems they had helped to build. And, most importantly, there were fellow targeted individuals, their eyes reflecting the same haunted look I saw in my own mirror, clinging desperately to the frayed edges of sanity, bound together by shared trauma and a burning desire for retribution. We shared our fragmented knowledge, our whispered theories, our shared trauma. Each of us carried a piece of the puzzle, a fragment of the truth. We were a collection of broken skulls, each bearing the indelible marks of the Neural Loom's intrusion, but together, we represented a potential threat, a flicker of rebellion in the face of overwhelming power, a spark of defiance in the encroaching darkness. We were the damned, but we were not defeated.

Chapter 8: The Skull and Key

Our rebellion began subtly, a whisper of static in the otherwise flawlessly orchestrated symphony of the Neural Loom. Like a virus disrupting a pristine computer program, we introduced glitches into their meticulously crafted reality, tiny fractures in the mirror they held up to our minds. We learned to shield our thoughts, to erect mental barricades against their invasive probes, constructing fortresses within the very landscape they sought to conquer. We delved into the arcane world of frequencies, developing counter-signals, dissonant harmonies designed to scramble their transmissions, to sow discord within the intricate network of control they had so painstakingly woven. It was a delicate dance, a high-stakes game of cat and mouse played on the invisible battleground of consciousness.

The Neural Loom, however, was not an entity to be trifled with. It was a hydra-headed beast, its tendrils reaching into every corner of our lives, its influence woven into the fabric of society itself. They retaliated swiftly and ruthlessly, deploying their agents, both human and technological, against us with chilling efficiency. Their human operatives, those who had willingly sold their souls to the cause of control, were relentless in their pursuit, their methods as varied as they were brutal. They infiltrated our ranks, sowing seeds of doubt and paranoia, turning us against each other. Their technological arsenal was even more terrifying: targeted attacks on our minds, subtle manipulations designed to break our resolve, to drive us back into the comforting embrace of their control.

One by one, our fragile alliance was decimated. Each loss was a devastating blow, a gaping wound in our already weakened ranks. Each fallen comrade was a skull added to their grim collection, a stark reminder of the immense power they wielded. The weight of these losses pressed down on us, a suffocating blanket of grief and fear. We knew our time was finite, that death was not just a possibility, but a looming certainty, a shadow that stretched across our path, growing longer with each passing day. But we were driven by something more powerful than fear, more enduring than grief: a burning desire to expose the truth, to tear down the edifice of lies they had constructed. We were determined to leave our mark on the world, to etch our defiance into the very fabric of history, even if it meant sacrificing ourselves, becoming skulls ourselves in the process.

This fight, however, demanded clarity, a sharpness of mind that the haze of methamphetamine could no longer provide. The drug, once a refuge, had become a shackle, dulling my senses, clouding my judgment. I knew, with a chilling certainty, that I could not continue down that path. If I was to have any chance of striking a blow against the Neural Loom, I needed to be clean, to be focused, to reclaim the full capacity of my mind. Quitting was a battle in itself, a war waged against my own cravings, against the insidious whispers that promised temporary relief. The withdrawal was brutal, a descent into a personal hell, but I emerged from it, battered but unbroken, my mind sharper, my resolve stronger.

Our final, desperate act of defiance, born of desperation and fueled by a righteous rage, led us to the very heart of the Neural Loom, a hidden facility nestled beneath the gleaming facade of a corporate tower, a modern-day Tower of Babel built on stolen thoughts and manipulated minds. We infiltrated the building under the cover of darkness, moving like shadows through its sterile, impersonal corridors, our minds shielded against their psychic probes, each of us carrying the weight of our fallen comrades, the burden of their sacrifice. We reached the central control room, a vast, cavernous chamber pulsating with raw, untamed power, the nerve center of the Neural Loom‚Äôs sprawling operations. Here, banks of servers hummed with the captured thoughts of millions, their individuality subsumed into the collective consciousness they controlled, their minds woven into the intricate tapestry of their design.

I located the Skull Key, a meticulously crafted sequence of neural impulses that could unravel the Neural Loom, shattering its control, disrupting the flow of information that gave it life. It was a desperate gamble, a suicide mission, a final, desperate throw of the dice. But it was our only chance, our last hope for freedom. As alarms blared, shattering the silence, and security forces converged on our position, I focused my mind, channeling all my pain, all my rage, all my fading hope, all the strength that remained within me.
.
Chapter 9: The Symphony of Silence


I unleashed the Skull Key. The effect was instantaneous, a cataclysmic surge of chaotic energy ripping through the intricate architecture of the Neural Loom like a lightning strike through a spider's web. The carefully constructed pathways of control fractured and shattered, sending shockwaves through the network, a digital earthquake that shook the very foundations of their power. The voices, for so long my tormentors, my constant companions, my jailers, screamed in unison, a chorus of digital agony, a symphony of despair. Then, as abruptly as it began, the cacophony ceased. Silence descended, a deafening, absolute emptiness that was more terrifying than any sound. It was the silence of a tomb, the silence of a mind finally released from its tormentors, the silence of a world teetering on the brink.

But the backlash was immense, a violent tempest unleashed by the shattering of their control. The facility's systems, pushed beyond their limits, overloaded, unleashing a cascade of destructive energy, a technological tsunami that ripped through the control room, tearing apart the machinery, the servers, the very fabric of the space. The air crackled with raw power, the scent of ozone heavy in the air. The room around me began to implode, the walls themselves seeming to scream in protest, buckling and groaning under the strain. Lights flickered and died, plunging the room into a strobe-like darkness, punctuated by flashes of blinding light.

I felt my skull resonate, a sharp, piercing pain that echoed through my very being, a physical manifestation of the psychic earthquake that had just occurred. It was as if the very bones of my head were vibrating, threatening to shatter. My body, weakened by years of abuse, by the relentless assault of the voices, by the self-inflicted damage of drug use, could not endure the strain. It was the breaking point, the moment when the fragile vessel of my being finally gave way. I collapsed, my legs giving out beneath me, the world dissolving into a swirling vortex of fractured light and sound, a chaotic ballet of destruction and release. But even as my consciousness flickered and faded, even as the darkness began to claim me, I saw the faces of my comrades, their eyes burning with a fierce resolve, a determination that mirrored my own. They would carry on the fight, they would ensure that the Neural Loom, this instrument of oppression, never again enslaved human minds. They would become the guardians of the silence, the keepers of the flame. My skull, in the end, joined the countless others, a silent testament to the war fought within the unseen landscapes of consciousness, a war for the very soul of humanity.

The world was irrevocably changed. The Neural Loom was no more, its secrets laid bare for all to see, its architects brought to justice, their power stripped away. But the scars remained, invisible wounds etched into the collective consciousness of humanity. We were forever haunted by the knowledge of what had been, a chilling reminder of the fragility of the mind, the precariousness of freedom. The silence, once a torment, a weapon wielded against me, became a constant companion, a somber reminder of the battle fought within the unseen landscapes of consciousness, a quiet testament to the sacrifices made.

I did not survive the battle. My skull, finally and irrevocably liberated from the voices that had haunted my every waking moment, joined the countless others, a silent testament to the war waged in the depths of human experience, a war that few understood, a war that even fewer believed. But my story, like a whisper in the wind, carried on the breath of those who remained, echoed through the world, a warning against the seductive allure of unchecked power, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming darkness, even when hope seems lost, the human spirit, fragile as it may seem, can still summon the strength to resist, to fight, to sacrifice. My skull, now just one among many, became a symbol: a symbol of the cost of freedom, a symbol of the enduring human spirit, a symbol of the war within. And though I was gone, the knowledge I carried, the key to understanding the Neural Loom, the map to its destruction, lived on, passed to those who would become the new guardians, the skull keepers, ensuring that such a horror never again took root, that the silence would remain unbroken, a testament to the victory hard won.

>*Park Jinyoung stands at the line between adulthood and boyhood, stepping gracefully across the icy landscape like gliding on a frozen lake.*

>**Long time no see. How was today's photoshoot?**\
It's been a while since I last dress up nicely and do a photoshoot, it was fun. I thought I‚Äôd feel awkward due to nervousness, but I enjoyed it more than I expected. I think the photos turned out really well, so everyone can look forward to them! (laughs)

>**How have you been lately?**\
I've been really busy. (laughs) I'm filming a drama and preparing for GOT7's album at the same time. Plus, the drama I filmed before enlisting is about to air, so it's been hectic.

>**It's been about a month since you were discharged (from military). Congratulations again.**\
Thank you! I‚Äôm so grateful to our fans. Waiting for someone for a year and a half isn‚Äôt easy, but they kept sending love messages and I want to thank them once again. People might think I had a hard time, and of course, there were tough moments, but I also had healing moments with my friends that I don't think I'll ever experience again. It was a time of growth for me.

>**The fancam of your performance at the Ground Forces Festival became a hot topic.**\
I didn‚Äôt know it was gaining attention at the time. After the performance, people around me started sending me the video. That's when I realized many people had watched it. (laughs)

>**Was it challenging to be with younger peers in the military?**\
I didn't feel a huge generation gap. We communicated well. (laughs) But at some point, they started treating me like an older brother, and that made me a bit sad.

>**You turned 30 while in the military. Has anything about your beliefs or perspectives changed?**\
It‚Äôs not so much that I changed, but I learned a lot. I realized there are so many different types of people in the world, and it‚Äôs okay not to live according to a set path. In the past, I was very inflexible and somewhat stiff, but after returning from the military, I realized that there are many different ways to live. I learned that I don‚Äôt have to be stubborn about just one thing. I think I‚Äôve learned to think more flexibly about life. (laughs)

>**How was your time in the military?**\
It would be a lie to say it wasn‚Äôt hard. Physically, it was tough, but I made many friends and learned a lot. I also realized that age isn‚Äôt everything. I met younger friends who were incredibly wise. Seeing such smart friends made me think, 'Ah, I was such a frog in a well', but I was happy nonetheless. (laughs)

>**On your discharge day, GOT7 member Yugyeom and BamBam came to visit you.**\
I had heard that Yugyeom was coming beforehand. Yugyeom asked, 'Hyung, where do I need to go?' so I told him. Actually, because it was so early in the morning, I told him to not come. It was early in the morning, it was cold and the place was really far, so (I thought) it would be difficult for him, but when they actually came for me, I was really grateful to my (group) members. And I thought, 'Wow, my military service is really over. As a Korean man, I‚Äôve successfully closed this chapter of my life.' I got emotional, but that‚Äôs as far as it went. I didn‚Äôt end up crying. (laughs)

>**The moment when you ran to your mom and put the military number tag around her neck was very impressive.**\
*(t/n: I'll use 'dog tag' instead of 'military number tag' for the word 'Íµ∞Î≤àÏ§Ñ' from this point on for this article.)*\
I think I‚Äôve seen a scene like that somewhere before. It might have been in a drama or a movie, and it looked really romantic. So, I kept thinking, 'I‚Äôll definitely do that when I discharge.' But the real behind story is that I lost my dog tag a few days before my discharge. So, on my last outing before discharge, I had to get a new dog tag. (laughs) So, I gave my mom the new dog tag. (laughs) 

>**I assume it must have been a period with a lot of thoughts, I'm curious about how you felt as discharge approached.**\
Honestly, it felt like everything was being let go. Is ""relieved"" the right way to express it? But honestly, I didn‚Äôt have any worries. I thought about all the worries and concerns I had for (the past) one and a half year, and the only thought I had was to just work diligently when I go out. (laughs)

>**You mentioned you became a lot stronger after enlisting. With that mindset, what you wanted to do the most?**\
The thing I wanted to do the most is travel. But I was acting kinda stupid, I could have gone before I started filming. I had everything planned. Now, all I needed was the ticket, but wait? I don‚Äôt have a passport? (laughs) I hadn‚Äôt made a passport. I just assumed I had it. So, I ended up not being able to go on the trip. It felt like a midsummer night's dream that just flew away, but I think I‚Äôll be able to go someday.

>**After the break from the military, your first schedule was meeting with your fans.**\
Honestly, I was really nervous. I felt like my heart was going to explode from my nervousness. So I honestly don‚Äôt remember what I did exactly. I saw myself in the live stream, (even) my smile didn't really look like a smile. (laughs) I was smiling because I was so happy, but at the same time, I was so nervous that smiling became really hard (for me). But still, when I saw the comments left by the fans, it was really fun. ""Our fans wore their rubber shoes backwards, but now they‚Äôre putting them on properly again~"" *(t/n: it's a saying that mean someone who was acting out of order previously got back on track)* thats what I thought.

>**Drama The Witch, which was filmed in advance, is your comeback project.**\
Mystery romance drama *The Witch* was directed by director Kim Tae-kyun, and I filmed it alongside actress Roh Jeongui. Many people have asked if it‚Äôs related to the movie of the same name *(suspense action movie starred Kim Dami)*, but it‚Äôs actually a completely different world and story.\
The character 'Park Mi-jeong,' played by actress (Roh) Jeongui, was admired by people around her, and with mysterious events occurred, those people (who admired her) would get hurt or die. My character, 'Lee Dong-jin,' worked hard to prove that Mi-jeong was not a witch by solving mysteries and uncovering the rules. 

>**This role risked his own life to protect the one he loved, against the rules of death. In reality, is there anything you would protect with your life?**\
I think this is the same for everyone. It would be family, right? And also my people (people I care about). If the situation called for it, I think we would all be willing to throw ourselves in to protect those we love.

>**What does love mean to you, Jinyoung?**\
Love feels like air. If I had to compare it, air is invisible and intangible, right? But we believe we would die without it. There are so many forms of love: love between family, between friends, between romantic partners. Even though we can‚Äôt see them, I believe that it‚Äôs through the connections of all these types of love that we are able to live.

>**Jinyoung is still: a boy VS an adult.**\
I'm not an adult yet. Socially, people may perceive my age as being older, but I wouldn‚Äôt call myself an adult just yet. (laughs)

>**Is there anything about you that still holds on to the feeling of being a boy?**\
I think it‚Äôs the desire to play. I couldn‚Äôt play much when I was younger, but during my time in the military, I didn‚Äôt work for a year and a half, so it was kind of nice. But I like having work. I‚Äôm thankful when there‚Äôs work. But still, sometimes I just want to play! (laughs)

>**It‚Äôs been 12 years since your debut, what has sustained you through those long and intense years?**\
Honestly it's the fans. We have a job that public can see, and since we want people to recognize us, we stand in front of cameras, talk, act, and sing. And those people who watch us are our fans. I think I felt it deeply during my military hiatus, 'If the fans hadn‚Äôt been there, could we have made it this far?' Over time, I unknowingly thought that it was a given sometimes, but I felt their importance so much that it became something I‚Äôm ashamed of. Without our fans, we wouldn‚Äôt have been able to sustain it (the career).

>**GOT7 is reuniting as a full group after almost three years.**\
Right. It was so much fun meeting up after such a long time. I thought that being with my members have taken me back to when I was young. It was like going back to when we were in our early twenties. We were so excited when we got together, and it was so fulfilling to see everyone grow and pursue their own music. I also thought about how much fun the fans would have seeing us. Honestly, activities in this industry are limited, and at some point, everyone will focus on their individual projects, but until the end, I believe we‚Äôll create fun memories with our fans. And that thought makes me so excited. To put it jokingly, it feels like we‚Äôre making an album to gather together, rather than gathering to make an album. When we say, 'Alright, let‚Äôs meet up now', we release an album, make music, and go through a really fun practice period."" (laughs)

>**Can you give a spoiler for the fans?**\
Members, can I say just one big thing? All the members have written songs in the album.

>**Is there a routine you do every day without fail?**\
I make sure to have breakfast and always brew coffee. You need to be healthy to do a lot of stuff, so I try to have breakfast without fail. I‚Äôve learned how important a regular life is, and I try to cook for myself as much as I can.

>**It seems like you're still adapted to military life.**\
My body hasn‚Äôt changed yet. If I sleep for just 7 hours, I wake up right away! Even though I‚Äôm really tired, I still find it hard to fall asleep. It wasn‚Äôt what I wanted, but it‚Äôs still the same. (laughs)

>**What kind of person do you think you are? (Describe what kind of person you are)**\
I'm a person with no limit. I want to keep changing. I don‚Äôt want to stay stuck in one thing, but I also don‚Äôt want to live too freely. I just want to live well, in whatever way. I‚Äôm adaptable, so I‚Äôll be fine. (laughs)

>**Are you happy these days, Jinyoung?**\
I‚Äôm really happy these days. I‚Äôm happy because I‚Äôm not unhappy. I think I‚Äôm happy because everyone around me is healthy. What is happiness, really? I think if you're not unhappy, that‚Äôs happiness. (laughs)

>**How would you fill in ‚ÄúJinyoung is OOO‚Äù?**\
Free *(t/n: as in freedom)*! Because I‚Äôm truly free. If you read the answers to the previous questions, you‚Äôll understand. I can do anything now. Therefore, I‚Äôm a free person with the passion to do anything! (laughs)

>**What‚Äôs your New Year‚Äôs resolution?**\
I want to do a lot of work. I think working is fun. So next year, I want to produce a lot of work. Without a rest! Ah, but I would like to take a short break in between. I want to go on a trip once. (laughs) I wish everyone a Happy New Year! (laughs)

>**Lastly, do you have a word for the readers of <The Star>?**\
Hello, readers of <The Star>! I‚Äôm Park Jinyoung. Did you enjoy my first post-military interview? I answered the questions roughly and freely, so I‚Äôm really curious to hear how you felt about the interview. (laughs) It was an honor to meet <The Star> readers, and I hope there will be more opportunities to work with <The Star> in the future. See you!",38,1738859231.0,Got7,3,1.0,False
1ij6j3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CamGirlProblems/comments/1ij6j3b/has_this_job_skewered_your_perception_of_normal/,Has this job skewered your perception of normal tips in vanilla jobs?,"I recently posted a (now self deleted) restaurant subreddit about tipping 2 euros with a 2-3 euro coffee, and how this either gets haggled down or refused entirely.

To me, these are not crazy amounts, but one person wrote that some cultures may perceive it as patronizing. I just want to help, don't want to make anyone feel bad, but can't agree with tipping less when I \*can\* tip more. Maybe my perception is completely off?

  
Eta: to clarify, i don't tip 80-10% when ordering more than a coffee. I feel pressured to order more so that they can take the 2 euros. For me, i just wish they'd accept the 2 euros. ",2,1738859209.0,CamGirlProblems,2,1.0,False
1ij6ioi,https://www.reddit.com/r/lcbo/comments/1ij6ioi/cream_liqueurs/,Cream Liqueurs?,"I‚Äôm trying to pick my next Crema Liqueur to try, I‚Äôve been on a kick lately. 

I‚Äôve tried Baileys, which is a classic but not my fave. I‚Äôve had Wayne Gretzky Original Cream which everyone raved over. I liked it more than baileys but wasn‚Äôt quite what I‚Äôm looking for. 

I‚Äôve also tried the white chocolate Mozart and the Bottega Fior di Latte which I loved both. I also really enjoy Rumchata. Caroleannes has been my favourite in hot chocolate. 

So I‚Äôm stuck on my next choice. 

I‚Äôve heard the Forty Creek Cream tastes like a coffee crisp. If that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs the one I want to try. 

I‚Äôve also heard that Magnum Scotch Malt Cream is good, plus it‚Äôs got a cool Tin bottle with a little hat. 

Five Farms Single batch has also gotten good reviews but it‚Äôs a bit up there in price for me. If it‚Äôs worth it though I‚Äôll give it a try. 

And finally Sheridans. Now I don‚Äôt know if this can be considered a cream liqueur but it‚Äôs on the list anyways. 

I‚Äôm looking for something creamy and caramel and not a huge alcohol taste. Something that works chilled and also in hot chocolate or coffee. Let me know your favourites, and cheers.

1ij6fbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Passport_Bros/comments/1ij6fbr/field_notes_detecting_the_manipulation_strategies/,Field Notes: Detecting The Manipulation Strategies of Golddiggers and Users (LatAm / Lima / Peru),"So, I have started to pick-up a a number of conversational patterns that can be detected early that indicate that a woman isn't going to relate to you as an equal, is looking for expensive free-meals, and is more interested in ""the princess treatment"" than having any orgasms. This is based on a few weeks in Lima in Peru.

This one goes out to all the guys who aren't looking for wives, but just enjoy having lovers with whom they relate as respectful equals - and don't want to be paying for it (or even worse, paying and not getting anything).

So, they will say things like: ""I believe in equality"", ""I don't care about money"", and even ""I don't expect men to pay for anything"".

However, they also use languge to try to establish an expectation based on (*alleged*) past experience. Almost always they will say ""**I don't** ***normally*** **do coffee dates**""\* - this is a very simple example of them avoiding responsibility for what they will or will not choose to do in the present moment but, instead, deferring to ""what is normal"" in the past. Always they will refuse to acknolwedge the basic fact ""I am choosing not to relate to you as an equal"".  
  
Other common examples:

**""I never ask to be taken to expensive restaurants; in the past men have just done that anyway because they know what I like""**

**""Usually a man will take me to many restaurants and first dates involve many fun activities; I usually decide if it feels right to be in a relationship with him after five or more dates""**

They also frequently emphasise their own (*alleged*) wealth and financial security, followed by a tacit revelation of expectations (expectations for financial exploitation):

**""I own my own business, I don't need men to buy me meals - it's just what I'm used to, because men tend to think I'm very valuable.""**

and yesterday

**""Money is no big deal for me, it's just a meal: and a $200 meal is just what I'm used to.""** (this is in Lima, in Peru, where a normal meal in a decent restaurant is about $10-20)

So the linguistic strategy for manipulation is never to ask, never to explicitly reveal entitlement, never to explicitly reveal they are (essential) trying to engage in prostitution: ***it is to describe a historical standard that tacitly implies you will be seen as less of a man/competitor if you do not comply with it. It is to establish an expectation tacitly, rather than explicitly, by comparing your spending to other men's spending***.

  
\*What I have noticed again and again is as soon as the initial ""**I don't** ***normally*** **do coffee dates**"" is dropped, the following type of statements can be reliably expected and predicted - so the pattern is very very clear, and women with this ""normalised prostitution ethic"" and attitude to men can be detected and weeded-out very quickly. Now I just block them as soon as they say such a thing, because it is highly-likely other entitled attitudes will follow.

  
As a part of a wider-game: when they detect a man who refuses to comply with the financial abuse they will generally make snide remarks, abusive comments, or imply that one is poor (I am not poor) - both a standard shit-test but also a way of, essentially, trying to collaboratively break the self-respect of men in general. Often in very subtle ways: **""You seem to be really concerned about money""** (yeah, i'm concerned about being used and exploited by game-playing manipulators - not about money), or **""most men don't** ***usually*** **care so much about paying for dates""** (go and find a man you can manipulate, because it isn't me). Always trying to maintain this worldview and basic system of gender-roles whereby they can endlessly exploit men for stuff instead of relating to men as equals.

  
So, learn from my experience here, if you're like me and only want to be fucking with women who want to fuck you (and don't expect you to pay for loads of meals before they do so) - look out for this common semantic strategy that bad-faith quassi-prostitue women seem to use a lot.

Here in Lima its about 20% of my matches - trying to play this game of ""White man take me to a restaurant: no sex necessary"". ",5,1738858953.0,Passport_Bros,1,0.86,False
1ij6e66,https://www.reddit.com/r/cocktails/comments/1ij6e66/of_ice_and_men/,Of Ice and Men,"Since there is a lot of information about making clear ice, but not a lot of feedback/follow-up on the results, I thought I'd share my observations to hopefully contribute and to solicitate feedback and ideas.

Disclaimer:

1. I am an amateur, a hobbyist. Profit or speed of service are not the motive here. I do this for fun.
2. Some will probably say ""too much time, too much money, too much effort, etc, etc, just put ice cubes in there and chug.  Sure, you can even drink straight from the bottle, I too thought it was cool when I was 18. Warning: to some of you the following will feel like a severe peanut allergy.
3. These observations are of course not scientific in any way, and of course you could get different results.

Benefits of quality ice cubes:

* People consume with their eyes first. Not counting my time, ice is the cheapest and one the most impactful ingredient to my cocktails. It seems to have more impact than most garnishes which people kind of expect.
* It communicates right away my enthusiasm and attention to details.
* Great conversation starter.

The method to madness:

Making the ice

We sees tons of posts about the process of using the a small Coleman cooler. That is what I use here. A few observations:

* It doesn't seem to matter if I use cold/hot/distilled/tap water.  I use straight tap water as it it good here.
* I don't fill the cooler all the way to the top.  It leaves space for expansion, and easier to avoid mess in the freezer.
* I seem to get better results if the temperature of my freezer is not all the way up.  Slow freezing might help pushing impurities down a bit better. My freezer doesn't have exact temperature, but mine is set at 4 out of 7. It take 30 hours in the freezer to get about a good 3 inch ice slab.
* It is very important to let the ice temper before handling it.  25-30 minutes works for me and yes I set a timer on my phone, because I forget...
* After that 25-30 minutes, I take the ice out of the cooler and remove the excess ice at the bottom and give it a rough trim.
* For piece larger than 2 inches, it works better to score the ice on all 4 sides.  Smaller than that, you can get away with scoring the top only.

* It possible to get smaller cubes of clear ice using the same method with smaller ice trays.  I happen to have a couple silicone trays that perfectly fit in another cooler have have. I don't even need extra support underneath.
* I experimented using an intact tray, and I made different shape holes in the other one.  I used a hole puncher for paper by folding the tray (hence the two holes per cube....) and also a drill.  If you drill too fast, it will tear up as you can see, but I got a few singles ones ok. A leather puncher would have surely been perfect here.

* The cubes from the intact tray indeed came out with a bulge of impurities at the bottom.  The one from the tray with holes came out perfect except for the ones with larger tear which left a knob.  The ice cube made with the made with the hole puncher (even with 2 holes) all came out perfect.  So I recommend using a paper puncher here for a clean job.

Cutting the ice

* A bread knife is really what you want to score the ice.  Common household item.
* I found that using a rubber mallet work better than a regular hammer or mallet. I don't really know why...

https://preview.redd.it/g6uuieh3yihe1.jpg?width=3372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d5729f4d71e3494be9ec2047335d3990cdda9419

* I get better results when I tap on the uniform side as the blade lays equally on top, the rough trimmed part on the bottom.
* Contrary to some comments I read, keeping the blade straight perpendicular instead of at a slight angle yield better results for me.  Less odd cuts and the ice doesn't slide sideways when tapping.

Shaping the ice

* After butchering plenty of ice with knifes, I had a breakthrough using heat:
* I first thought of using a frying pan to quickly shape the ice to what I was looking for.  Although it was indeed working, the frying pan offered a few challenges: 1. It's small so you don't have space to quickly manipulate the ice.  2. Water stays in the pan, and boils, you need multiple quick trips to the sink. 3. Water accumulate quickly and it melt the corners of the ice. (See picture below, I made one and exaggerated the effect for you to see what I am talking about)

https://preview.redd.it/vavqtjz25jhe1.jpg?width=3372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8fbec61938e5aecba241552e498b17caa1e0a95b

* I remembered that we have one of those tabletop griddle thing sitting there, just collecting dust!  Large, flat surface, it even have a small slant, a drip channel and tray so water doesn't stay.  And the rest is history...

https://preview.redd.it/okl2i3g09jhe1.jpg?width=3372&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1171bb84021c7a525eb58aff370397c24888476

* Keep the heat very low, no rush here.

Preserving the ice

* Because I take a bit of time doing all this, the cubes are on the counter for a few minutes.  Since they are already tampered, they continue to melt (somewhat faster?) until you get them in the fridge.  If you just put them in a tray in the freezer, they will all freeze together and will be a pain to use later on. When still working on the cubes, I put them in a dish plate, and when ready for the freezer, I transfer them again in a new dry plate, so the melted water doesn't refreeze on my precious cubes.
* I don't put them in the tray right away, put them in the freezer all separated, only for a few minutes, or longer, it doesn't matter.  They will then refreeze solid and not stick together when you finally store them for use.

About those ice spheres

If you are lucky (or crazy) enough to have a japanese ice press, here are a few more observations:

* They absolutely work fine, but you can't use them repeatedly (mine anyway) as they get extremely cold when shaping ice.  Of course, the cold is transferred to the aluminum device.  If you just heat it back up under hot water and use them straight away, they will produce an uneven shape, more like an egg.
* If you use an ice cube larger than required, the press will stall midway as it became too cold before going through all the ice.  I started shaping cubes to get the minimum ice required to form a perfect sphere.  I then came across a video of someone coming up with the simplest solution:  Using an insulated metal coffee mug.
* Of course you have to find one the right size, but also make sure it tapered a bit (see picture) so the ice gets out easily.

* It works the same as the cooler method: fill up, freeze for some time, let temper 25 minutes, take out, clean the bottom.  Goes straight in the freezer for use. When time comes for use let temper on the counter a few minutes (like regular ice) so it doesn't crack when you put it in the japanese ice press. You can of course also shape them, and freeze the sphere right away.

About crushed ice

* A nugget ice maker would be soooo nice.  That ice looks perfect for crushed ice applications.  The price seems a bit prohibitive (for me anyway), you can't leave the ice in there, and seems to require a bit on maintenance.
* I know a lot of people are using mallet and lewis bag, but I looking at videos, it seems messy, with a lot of loss (ice obliterated to powder), and produce a lot of uneven pieces and shards, so less consistency.  And yes, it makes you look like a bit of a neanderthal behind the bar.  I was looking for an alternative.
* First bought one of those small manual crusher. Took time to compare a few on the internet, I thought I bought a good one.  They are a bit of hard to operate and unstable with that side crank, and you can only crush a few bit of ice at a time.  Then a bit of plastic broke off, maybe the cold, maybe the excessive force on that crank.  I was still able to use it, and then it began to introduce black bits (rust I guess) in my ice (yes, I cleaned it really well) Cheap parts probably.  All this after 10-12 uses at most.  So yeah, trashed it.
* I finally took a chance on a electric ice crusher (actual shards, not a slush or shavings).  It works flawlessly, crush a decent amount of ice quickly, and produce somewhat even shards.  I've had it for over a year now, so far, so good. I am very happy with it.

The Future

* It would be so nice to have a consumer grade (as oppose to commercial) bandsaw specifically design to cut cocktail ice.  There are of course meat bandsaw on the market, even smaller one used by hunters, but those are still rather large, and the prices are so high (again, for me).

¬†Long story somewhat short, over the weekend I began experiencing some pain (sharp, quickly goes away) on the chewing surface on my bottom first molars. Only occurred sometimes while brushing and chewing crunchy/harder/tougher foods (never any pain when eating softer foods like pasts, fruit, etc.) No sensitivity to hot/cold. I also noticed some small grooves/indents/hole-type things on both teeth that I‚Äôd never noticed before, though they may have been there all along.

Went to the dentist. They didn‚Äôt see anything on x-rays or while looking ad poking around in my mouth. They had me bite down on something on various spaces on my teeth, but no pain, so they ruled out a fracture. They also did a bite alignment test, as I had cavities on my second molars filled just a few months back, but that was also fine.

They ultimately couldn‚Äôt diagnose anything, and recommended that I switch to a Sensodyne toothpaste and come back if the pain worsens or becomes more constant.

I did not realize how many different types of Sensodyne toothpastes there are, lol. I ended up grabbing one that said gum and enamel sensitivity. But I was just curious which one you all would recommend.

Also, I know it‚Äôs difficult to diagnose without any pictures or x-rays, but any ideas why I could be having that pain? I brush twice daily, try to floss at least a few times a week (I'm trying to make it a daily habit), don't drink or smoke, and have soda maybe once every other month. I am a big coffee drinker, though, and bad teeth run in my mom's side of the family.",1,1738858770.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

We had fun over the course of a few hours and exchanged phone numbers. Texted back-and-forth for a bit and she agreed to meet up for coffee. That turned into about a five hour outing walking around getting lunch and what not. Since then, we‚Äôve gone on a hike for a few hours and have a bowling outing set up for this weekend.

My problem here is that I‚Äôm not sure if she‚Äôs interested in me or not. I know that might sound stupid with what I posted above, however when we are not together, it‚Äôs almost silence on her part. For the first week, I would never get a text from her unless I initiated. Combine that with the sometimes 1 to 2 hour delay between text messages and I‚Äôm confused thinking that she doesn‚Äôt really wanna talk with me. When we meet up in person, everything‚Äòs fine (I hope haha) but then once she leaves it‚Äôs complete silence on her end. I don‚Äôt wanna be a weirdo who‚Äôs constantly texting her. I just assumed if someone was interested in you they would also want to ask you questions see what your interests are etc. but after the first day of initial texting, I‚Äôve gotten next to no questions about what I‚Äôm doing or what I‚Äôm interested in.

She‚Äôs into art so one day I texted her saying I was going to this new museum to learn more about her interests (she was working so couldn‚Äôt invite her) and that was met with a ‚Äúcool you‚Äôll have to tell me about it‚Äù then when I get back, just asking her how her day was, she‚Äôll talk about what she did and that‚Äôs it. No questions about what I was up to or the museum I told her I was going to see so I‚Äôm confused.

My question is: do I just ask her if she sees us is more than friends or not?

I get it. It‚Äôs only been two weeks. We‚Äôve met up in person twice now, I just don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable if I try to push this more romantic and she just wants to keep this platonic. Would a simple. ‚Äú hey x, I‚Äôm interested in getting to know you more but I‚Äôm not sure if you see this relationship as just friends or not.‚Äù I feel like this might be a stupid question just to flat out ask someone. However, I am looking to eventually find a wife and settle down and if she just wants to be friends that‚Äôs fine but I‚Äôm going to have to start looking at dating someone else.

Misc details: I will say after the second date she actually did ask how my day was and that actually surprised me (is that sad? lol) so maybe it‚Äôs more of a very slow and steady thing with her?

TL;DR met someone at a singles cooking class, dates seem to go well, but little contact from her outside of them and she doesn‚Äôt seem to show interest in my personal life. Do I flat out just ask her if she‚Äôs interested? Or is that weird?",1,1738858768.0,relationship_advice,2,0.99,False
