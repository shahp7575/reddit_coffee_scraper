I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post.

 I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s that's  25+ to your early 30s ideally please. Maturity is also a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way. 

I love salmon my favourite fish and I love avocados they are so good for the skin. I love having nice burgers out and I also make my own from scratch smash burgers making your own is the best way at home. I love Italian food pasta and pizza the proper stuff being close to Italy we get a lot of the authentic Italian food here. 

I love Indian food too curries for me are probably my favourite food out of them all I don’t think you can beat this type of food when it’s done properly. Fish and chips proper English style would also be a favourite of mine. 

Burgers I love five guys and shake shack we had Both of these when I lived in the UK. In France we have five guys but I also love Burger King I love the flame grilled burgers 

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings either and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have an cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don't wear any heavy makeup fake tan fake nails fake eyelashes and fake hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy.

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

My life hasn't derailed but I can feel it slipping away now. Really feeling like a last chance situation for my marriage which is the most important thing in my life.

I have finally started going to meetings, five in a week. Absolutely fascinated by the Big Book, somebody bought me at my first meeting back. Speaking with potential sponsors and taking things one day at a time. The steps don't seem so daunting to me this time. Feeling comfortable with letting go of the need to control and submitting my will to the power greater than myself.

He is a senior who graduated last May. He’s intelligent, curious, and great at giving advice. He doesn’t use social media, enjoys being alone, has an incredible attention span, and once he starts studying, he can lose track of time for hours. He’s preparing for government exams and loves studying history and culture, among other things.

When I met him, he was giving me advice about what to study and about placements. I noticed a sense of disappointment in him because, despite having skills and doing so much, he was still unplaced. I fell for him then, but I have no idea why. I just started crushing on him.

I did tell him anonymously on Instagram once that someone had a crush on him. He saw it a week later and asked for my identity, but I didn’t give him any further hints. Nothing came of that. Recently, I contacted him again regarding some confusion I had about a decision I was making, and later that evening, I told him that I was the person from Instagram. He was surprised and said, “You took so much time to tell me this,” but he seemed curious. That night, he mentioned, “You know I’m berozgaar (unemployed). What do you see in me?” I told him I didn’t have an answer, and then he became more accepting toward me.

He said, “You know, if you had told me this in person, how good it would have felt.” I responded that we could either move forward or just stay friends if he didn’t want anything more. He said, “We will see.” However, since that conversation, I’ve noticed a shift in his behavior. He started telling me, “You’re still a kid, men are weird creatures, you’re not very mature yet,” and that he has a lot of restrictions. He then told me to focus on studying and building my career, implying that this isn’t the right age for such things.

He once mentioned during a phone call that he has some family and financial issues, which has added to his stress. For a few days after our conversation, he replied to my texts, but now he’s completely ignoring them. His last seen status on WhatsApp is often hours ago, and sometimes even more. I’m not sure what to do about it or whether I should just let go.

I really like him and was hoping that something serious could happen between us, but he doesn’t seem ready or open to that. I asked him if we could meet for dinner, and he said, “You grow up and become a mature woman, and we will.” Later, I asked if we could at least meet for coffee, and he said, “Okay, we will,” but he didn’t mention anything further.

1j70r7a,https://i.redd.it/ag0pmu3bplne1.jpeg,Does anyone have a link for this story?? Thanks!,"Jefferson Pack

My nails dug into my palms as I stared at my phone. The pain in my hands was nothing compared to the pain in my heart.

For years, I was Luna Cheyenne—loyal, devoted, and unwavering beside Alpha Tanner in the Jefferson Pack. But tonight, everything shattered.

Arielle Gardner, his new she-wolf mistress, had sent me a degrading photo: Tanner in bed with her, too close and careless. Her caption read, “A real Alpha knows who to choose,” followed by a mocking message: “Poor Cheyenne, he’s mine now. Accept it and move on.”

Did she think I’d break? Cry? Beg Tanner to come back to me?

I refused to break. I am Luna Cheyenne—I do not beg.

Later that night, I strode into the South Wing where Tanner, Arielle, and even Natasha were dining. All eyes fell on me as I held up my phone.

“Is this what you wanted me to see?” I demanded.

A dismissive snort came from Tanner. “Cheyenne, go back to your room. Stop being dramatic.”

Dramatic? I slammed a document onto the table. “I, Luna Cheyenne of the Jefferson Pack, reject you, Alpha Tanner, as my mate. The bond once blessed by the Moon Goddess is now void—this rejection takes effect tonight.”

In that moment, as silence fell over the room, I turned and walked out, leaving behind not only a broken bond but the promise of a life forever changed.

......

Tanner, who liked to portray himself as a devoted mate, was caught having an affair with his mistress Omega from a neighboring pack. 

Even Natasha, my mother-in-law and the former Luna of the Jefferson Pack, who once treated me like her own daughter, even took his side, trying to justify his actions. ""You're getting older, Luna Cheyenne,"" her voice cold and detached. ""Carrying pups is tough, and Tanner found someone younger for the sake of continuing the pack's bloodline. As the luna of our pack, you should try to understand.""

I threw the degrading photos in front of Tanner during a pack meeting, his Alpha aura flaring as he glared at me. But instead of remorse, he justified himself. ""Cheyenne, Arielle gave up the chance to join a prestigious pack abroad to help me. I can't just abandon her now. From now on, you'll stay in the North Wing, and she'll live in the South Wing. We'll keep everything separate.""

These words sliced through my heart like a blade. 

He never cared about me, not even for a moment.

The South Wing, a lavish territory he had carved out for her, was a grand gift he'd showered on her. When he split our lives into North and South like that, the last remnants of my feelings for him disappeared entirely.

""Tanner, I want to dissolve our mate bond. This isn't how I want to live,"" I said calmly, my voice steady despite the ache in my chest.

At my words, both Tanner and Natasha froze, their coffee cups nearly slipping from their hands.

""Luna Cheyenne,"" Natasha said, her tone sharp, ""what are you saying? Dissolving the mate bond? After everything you've built together since your college days, it's heartbreaking to hear this.""

But Tanner never considered the pain his actions caused me. Our love story, which had started as a college romance and blossomed into a partnership leading the Jefferson Pack, now felt like a distant memory.

Just for his new mistress, a little Omega, he destroyed everything including my love and loyality to him. 

I composed myself, masking my emotions with a cool indifference. ""Dissolving the bond will free both you and Arielle.""

Tanner's expression darkened, his Alpha aura pressing down on me. ""Cheyenne, I'm the Alpha of the Jefferson Pack. Dissolving the bond would cause chaos in the pack and tarnish my reputation. Even Arielle, just 20 years old, understands my responsibilities. How can you not see that? I just want to care for her and have a pup together. Don't be so selfish.""

When he mentioned having a pup, his gaze lingered on me deliberately, his piercing eyes brimming with a disdain that cut deeper than any words. My infertility was no secret within the Jefferson Pack.

Tanner and I had fallen in love during our university days. Back then, the Jefferson Pack was still rebuilding its strength, and Tanner was simply the heir to the Alpha title. We both shared a vision for the pack's future and dedicated ourselves to strengthening our territory after he took over.

Our Progressive ideals often clashed with the rigid traditions of other packs, and many doubted our ambitions. Yet, through my relentless negotiations and diplomacy, I forged alliances that were once thought impossible.

To secure alliances, I often had to endure grueling negotiations and pack politics, which took a toll on my health. After one particularly taxing mission, I fell gravely ill, and the healers informed me that carrying pups might be impossible. I thought about leaving Tanner then, but he held my hand tightly and vowed, ""Cheyenne, I owe much of the pack's strength to you. Even if we can't have pups, I'll always honor and protect you.""

That promise, once a beacon of hope, had faded with time. Under Natasha's relentless pressure for an heir, Tanner revealed my infertility to her. From that moment, her warmth toward me turned to icy indifference.

""Luna Cheyenne, please understand,"" Tanner said, his Alpha tone softening as if to placate me. ""I can't live without an heir, nor can I focus only on you. It's better if you agree to my arrangement. You stay in the North Wing, Arielle in the South Wing, and I'll visit you regularly.""

The North Wing had once been our sanctuary, where he'd held me after our marking ceremony and whispered, ""Cheyenne, this will be our home forever. We'll never part.""

But it seemed those promises were only true while the bond was still intact.

""Cheyenne, I won't agree to dissolve the bond,"" Tanner said, his voice firm. ""Think it over seriously.""

The sound of his car engine starting below marked his departure to see Arielle. Perhaps all those ""late-night pack meetings"" had really been spent with her.

As his car disappeared into the distance, I wiped the tears from my cheeks. These would be the last tears I shed for Tanner. Resolve replaced sorrow as I rose to reclaim my dignity.

After regaining my composure, I contacted Milan, a highly respected Beta from a neighboring pack known for his wisdom and fairness. I asked him to help me draft the necessary agreements to dissolve the mate bond. Tanner's betrayal left me no choice but to claim my rightful share of the pack's resources and territory.

If Tanner thought he could cast me aside so easily, he had gravely underestimated me.",1,1741498553.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

And I need advice because I think he’s slowly messing with my brain.

On paper, we should not get along. He’s the most frustrating person I know—constantly debating me, correcting my grammar (who does that??), and acting like he’s always the smartest person in the room (annoyingly, he usually is). He teases me relentlessly, judges my music taste, and somehow always finds a way to get under my skin.

But then he does things like remember my coffee order without me ever telling him. Or show up to walk me home if I’m out late. Or notice when I’m uncomfortable at a party and pull me out of the conversation without me even asking. And I think about these little things *way too much*.

I’m not even sure if he likes me like that. He’s dating someone, and I’m also kind of seeing someone (though, let’s be honest, it’s not going anywhere). But there’s something there, right? Or am I just imagining it?

I know everyone’s going to say “just talk to him,” but I’m terrified it’ll make things weird. And honestly, I don’t even know if I *want* something to happen. It’s already complicated enough.

I'll share my story:

While playing on Lost River, there was a pack on the map named ""Coffee Pot"", and I had named all the wolves from that pack to keep track of them.

One of my pups dispersed, and it took a long, long time for him to found a pack. And when he did, his home hex was in the very MIDDLE of the Coffee Pot territory. His pack name? ""The Beans"".

I interpreted this as a civil war in the Coffee Pot pack that divided the pack in two. The breaking point for them was my pup arriving, which gave one half the final push they needed to leave the Coffee Pot and create The Beans.

It was all made better by the fact that he was dating an older Coffee Pot subordinate—enemies to lovers maybe?

The best thing about this for me was the fact that coffee comes from beans, and The Beans came from the Coffee Pots. Absolutely amazing ☕️🫘",7,1741497962.0,WolfQuestGame,0,1.0,False

I'm an Eng student and I find this hilariously accurate. Here's what it said.

**Welcome to** r/McMaster **Engineering**, where caffeine is a lifestyle and group projects are the true test of survival.

1. **""Caffeine: Liquid Survival""** McMaster Engineering students don’t just drink coffee—they **mainline it**. At this point, their blood is probably 70% espresso. ""I’m running on 3 hours of sleep and 7 cups of coffee"" they say, as their heart rate hits 200 BPM. You’re one cup away from needing a *defibrillator*.
2. **""Sleep Deprivation: Their True Degree""** These students treat sleep like an optional class. “I haven’t slept in 48 hours,” they say proudly, like it’s a *badge of honor*. Nah, it’s a *warning sign*. At this rate, their body’s not even running on energy—it’s running on pure panic and expired Red Bull.
3. **""Group Projects = Hostage Situations""** Group projects? More like a *reality show*. There’s always that one person who does nothing but contribute 5-minute rants about “optimization” while everyone else scrambles to actually finish it. The real teamwork? Surviving the trauma together. No, Steve, we don’t need *your* perfect ideas; we just need to **submit** before the Wi-Fi crashes.
4. **""Procrastination Is Their Superpower""** McMaster Engineers can look at a 20-page report and still think, “Yeah, I’ll do this *later*.” Then, 5 minutes before the deadline, they’re cramming like it’s the end of the world. But don't worry, they’ll still tell you, “I *totally* planned this out.” Yeah, planned to have a panic attack at 2 AM.
5. **""The Printer Crisis""** You ever see a McMaster Engineer try to print something? It’s like they’re trying to solve world hunger. “Why won’t it print?!” they scream, as their laptop has a meltdown. It’s a **printer**, dude—not a NASA mission. Calm down, it’s not the end of civilization.
6. **""Coffee > Everything""** Forget food. Forget sleep. McMaster Engineers *run on coffee*. They can write 30 pages of code in one sitting but can’t remember their own name after the 5th cup. If they run out of coffee, they might as well be on life support.
7. **""The Final Countdown""** It's 3 AM. They're trying to finish that assignment that’s due in 2 hours, fueled by pure coffee and panic. Their fingers are moving at *spy-movie speed*, and yet, they still manage to forget half the problem. ""Wait, where did my report go?"" Who needs sleep when you’ve got a Wi-Fi connection and *Google*?

So I did a head to head competition to see what was good and what was better since I was nearly out of Kirkland/Costco's and was curious what I'd do next.First, I realized the ABV of the redesigned recipe is lower proof than his original and most other Irish Creams, but I planned to make it as he wrote it.  I considered messing with the proof later.

As a base I used Paddy's Irish Whiskey ($22 for 750ml), made his original (with sweetened condensed milk) and his new version (with evaporated milk).

Making and tasting the new one first, I was stunned how strong the coffee flavor was.  I mean stupidly strong.  So when I made the original recipe, I halved the coffee (which turned out to be best).  Since I used Nescafe, I don't see my ingredient being wrong.

Still, the new version was so coffee strong, I thinned it out with half and half and more whiskey until it was tolerable... and then added Irish Cream flavored coffee creamer so it's drinkable instead of throwing it away.  So that was last place before I even started.

Tonight I did a side by side taste test:

Bailey's, my original favorite, St. Brendan's which was my favorite for many years after that, Kirkland's which I've been buying instead for so very long, and the original Top Secret recipe version.

While the original Top Secret is tasty with reduced coffee powder, it does taste of canned condensed milk and even if you use an inexpensive whiskey, it's still the same cost (or more) than St. Bendan's or Kirkland.  So this is second to last place.

Bailey's has a much stronger chocolate flavor than I remember... but it really was probably the tastiest and smoothest, but maybe a bit less whiskey flavored.  Tough call.  Good, but I don't think worth the price.

Then I discovered something and it's the reason for this post... I don't think I could taste a difference between Kirkland and St. Brendan's.  To me they have a similar mouth feel, flavor and whiskey after taste.

Am I the only one to think maybe they are Costco's source?  Price wise, it would certainly make sense but I found this really surprising.

Thought's?  Recommendations?

Hey everyone.

So I’m a bearded and tattooed guy that is also a dad. I’m married, have a fantastic job, travel a lot, and living a life most would be envious of. I guess it depends on what makes you envious. I don’t brag but I’ve been told that. It drives me insane because I’m always busy. I guess busy is good.

But I’m also lonely and mostly tired.

About me first. I work quite a bit. Sometimes I travel, most times I find. But my life is basically just meetings about meetings and it’s exhausting. I play some music while working. I play guitar and piano, neither one very good but I think they’re decent at least. I read a lot which makes me write a lot. I write mostly poetry and short stories. Nothing longer has lived up to my expectations. 

I’m a coffee snob that loves concerts. If you like a band I let have already seen them live. I love it. I love to cook, and I really enjoy nerdy things like making spreadsheets for everything. Both arms are covered in ink and I plan to get many more.

You? Just be cool. I don’t have stipulations other than you at least try to have convo. I want to be seen and heard and I want someone I look forward to talking to.

I have been chasing the dream of drinking a cup of coffee that tastes like biting into a cherry, with cola notes, and a very sweet, syrupy finish. 

I buy every Bourbon varietal I come across, but they seem to be processed to bring out acidity and brightness. 

I’m not looking so much for brightness, versus “saturation” to use a color analogy. 

I just want to taste Pinkish-red as a dominant flavor in my espresso. 

Any recommendations on roasters and specific bags? Should I look for Natural processed, or fermented, or honey processed? 

I brew my “I want to taste the notes” coffee in a cafelat Robot. Otherwise milk drinks are brewed in an e61 hx machine. If there was a coffee that you could taste the berries even THROUGH the milk I will owe you forever. 

//tangential question, anyone have any good resources for hyper fixating on the different coffee processing methods? There is a dearth of information on YT about it compared to equipment videos. I feel like coffee choice is the most important part, yet gets the least attention. Probably because we can’t really control the processing but as individual end users I guess.

Group Discussion (GD) Topic: India should implement UCC

Key Points I Made in GD:

1. Explained how UCC would help alleviate the pressure on the judiciary.
2. Addressed the argument that UCC is not required now but might be in a developed nation, clarifying how UCC exists in some form in developed countries and its benefits.
3. Clarified the misconception that UCC is related to criminal law.
4. Before the conclusion of the GD, I reinforced my first point and provided an approximate statistic to support it.

# Personal Interview (PI)

P1 welcomed me into the room. I waited for him to take his seat, but on P2’s insistence, I sat down first. I greeted both panelists with a ""Good afternoon"" before taking my seat.

P2: So, how are you?  
Me: I am fine, sir.  
P2: Just fine??  
Me: Yes sir, just a bit nervous.  
P1 and P2 (simultaneously): We are just having a conversation. Nothing to be worried about.  
Me: I understand, but it's very important for me.  
P2: So, it's your first interview?  
Me: No Sir, second… of my life.  
P2: Which was the first one?  
Me: CAP.  
P1: Ok, how was it?  
Me: I wouldn’t say too good or too bad.  
P2: So, average?  
Me: Just above average.  
P1: Hmm, mota-moti right?  
Me: (Nodded in agreement.)

P2: So, you are from Odisha. Where exactly are you from?  
Me: Sir, I was born and brought up in Rourkela and I am currently pursuing an Integrated MSc in Mathematics and Computing in Bhubaneswar.  
P2: So, you are pursuing a Master’s now? It’s not mentioned here anywhere.  
Me: Sir, I am pursuing it, but it’s not over yet.  
P2: Why MBA, Deepanjan?  
Me: I want to go into operations, and an MBA provides greater opportunities. I also feel I am ready to do an MBA.  
P2: So, if you get an admit from any IIM, would you drop your Master’s?  
Me: Yes sir, I believe I have learned whatever was necessary for me to pursue an MBA.  
(P2 smirked slightly.)  
Me: Subjects like ODE, Probability and Statistics, OB, and OR will help me in an MBA.

P2: So, are you comfortable with your academics?  
Me: Yes, sir.  
P2: What is the difference between Differentiation and Integration?  
Me: (Started to explain but got interrupted.)  
P2: Explain as if I am a layman.  
Me: (Asked for permission to use an example and explained using TSD relationships.)  
P2: Can you explain the use of Matrices?  
Me: (Tried to explain with OR but got interrupted. After getting permission, I completed my thought, stating that matrices can be used to solve OR problems, helping in cost-saving and profit maximization.)

P2: Deepanjan, do you read newspapers?  
Me: No, but I keep up with news that affects me and my loved ones.  
P2: So, if you become a manager, then?  
Me: I would consider my team as my loved ones…  
(Got interrupted by room service bringing coffee, lemonade, and cashews to the panelists. P2 smiled and laughed lightly before continuing.)  
P2: Would you like a cup of tea?  
Me: No, sir.  
P2: Why?  
Me: Sir, I don’t consume any caffeine.  
P2: Cashews, then?  
Me: No, thank you, sir.  
P1: Ok, please continue.  
Me: (Explained how I would consider my team as family and how the company's success or failure would directly impact me, so I would care for them as loved ones.)

P2: Deepanjan, do you think you are an ethical person?  
Me: I consider myself an ethical person.  
P2: What do you mean? Others won’t consider you ethical? (Smirking slightly.)  
Me: Sir, I believe ethics are self-defined. What might be ethical for you might not be for me.

P2: Okay, what is your goal post-MBA?  
Me: Sir, I want to get into Operations.  
P2: I mean long-term.  
Me: Sir, professionally a COO or CEO in 20 years, and personally… (Gets interrupted.)  
P2: So, let’s say you are a CEO of a company, and I am a billionaire politician. Your company is doing well, and I ask you for some insider information in return for huge sums of money and a 100% guarantee of immunity from legal action. Would you help me?  
Me: No, sir, I wouldn’t. It would be against my ethical standards.  
P2 (smirking): Why would you not consider it? You would have a salary of a maximum of ₹1 crore, but say I offer you ₹100 crores for a 10-minute call. You would earn more in those 10 minutes than in your entire career.  
Me: No, sir, I wouldn’t. (Grilling continued a bit more.)

P1: Why do you think OB is in your subject list?  
Me: To increase employability, as per my subject teacher.  
P1: What was the best lesson you learned in OB?  
Me: (Talked about a PPT we had in OB.)  
(P1 seemed unsatisfied.)

P1: Ok Deepanjan, let’s talk about Plan B. God forbid, if you don’t get into your dream B-school this year, what would you do post your MSc?  
Me: I would take an opportunity aligned with my goals, which currently would be any Data or Business Analyst role post-MSc. If needed, I might consider an MBA again after a few years.  
P1: Don’t you think you are better off with the plan you just said?  
Me: No, sir, I believe I am ready. My academic journey in Mathematics enables me to do an MBA with relative ease.  
P1: You say you are ready, but are you academically ready?  
Me (after a significant pause): Sir, if you mean my academic grades, especially till the 3rd semester, I understand your disappointment. But you can see a growth pattern where I improved my grades, and I intend to continue this in my MBA.  
P2: You mean growth, not a bell curve, right?  
Me (laughed): Yes, sir, growth curve only.

P1: You may go. It was a pleasure talking to you.  
Me: Thank you, sir. I hope to meet you again soon.  
P1 and P2: We wish to meet you too, but let’s see.  
Me: Thank you again, sir. Have a great day.

the twice a day i got. flossing: done, though i have to get a thinner floss but thats whatever. i’ve been doing before breakfast and right before bed. if i eat something super sugary such as candy, i will wait an hour and then brush. if i have something acidic like my daily coffee, i will rinse with mouthwash (or really good with water!) after finishing.

i got THIS very specific advice from a dentist yesterday when going in for pain and discovering i needed two fillings. (this was not from the dentist who serviced me, but from another one who came in and had me sign a paper agreeing to the fillings. he cited studies and everything. told me why brush in the morning when i havent eaten? by bed time theres so much bacteria from eating all day they dont care if you brush by then. i was so confused. and 15 minutes seems so short, no?)

i’ve got bad dental history in my family so no matter what i did, this was just happening. my previous dentist should’ve caught these cavities at my last checkup. his last filling fell out twice. then the people yesterday did not check if i could floss and ignored me when i said my bite was off after the fill. the office i went to today saw i could not bite correctly nor floss correctly and helped me out which i greatly appreciated.

so PLEEEEEASE tell me what you think!

should i brush before or after breakfast? after every meal? if so, how long should i wait after eating? should i use mouthwash right away? or wait for that too?

i have received a lot of conflicting info and i just want to know what you all think. i’m just so confused and scared of dentists now. thanks y’all!",1,1741496617.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False
1j70852,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Wheredoistart1225/comments/1j70852/25_years_later/,25+ years later,Well after over 25 years I've pondered this and decided to tell my story to get a perspective on what strangers think about this. I know that after I tell my story there will still be people who will think I'm a terrible person no matter the circumstances and that's not something I have the ability to change about them and frankly don't even want to try anymore. So here goes. When I was 18 I was dating a woman much older than me. She was in her late 30s to early 40s. We kinda dated for a bit under a year but after a while my friends and family started telling me that this wasn't cool and that we were way too far apart on age to have a relationship but the one comment that came from a close friend that actually struck a chord was how would you feel if this was your mom and I knew then I had to do the right thing. I called her and asked her to meet me at a coffee shop I told her that this wasn't fair that we had such a large gap between us and that she deserved better and to date somebody closer to her own age. She looked a bit upset but told me that she has been expecting this and was surprised it lasted as long as it did. She told me it was cool and that she wished me the best and that she understood. I felt bad but I knew it was the best thing to do. Several months later she called me and told me that she it didn't sit well with her how things ended with us and that she wanted to see me one more time to end things right between us. I told her I didn't think it was a good idea because I was worried it might get stuff started again with us and that's not what I wanted to have happen with us. She told me that I don't understand she wanted to go out with a real bang (her exact words) and told me to come over and that she had another girl there and that we were all gonna have fun. I told her I'd call her back and let her know. I can't lie I was super nervous but extremely excited at the notion of having a 3some with 2 girls. I called my friend and he told me I had nothing to lose and only a fool would turn that down. In retrospect what average now 19 year old guy would say no to that. So I called her back and told her I'd come over that night. I came over and the other girl there seemed shy but was very nice. We all started doing our thing together (keep this part in mind the together part). After that was over we hung and talked for a lil while and the other girl went to another room and the girl I knew told me she wanted to rinse off. I was still kinda in the mood so I went in the room and asked that girl if she was down to do more and she agreed so we started to make out and when we were about five minutes in she walked and was going absolutely crazy telling me wtf are you doing? I was a bit confused but I just told her what you invited me here to do what else. She then screamed at me and called me a sick bastard and how can I do this to her daughter. I was absolutely stunned and immediately knew from the way she was looking at me that this was planned I just looked at the other girl as I grabbed my clothes and just told her I'm so sorry and got dressed and left. Of course she called the police and told them she walked in on me having sex with her daughter and forgot to mention all the stuff that happened before that. But thankfully the police didn't look at me like a sick pedo and wanted to actually hear what happened from my perspective and asked if I even knew how old she was. I said by the way she looked I assumed around my age and I was stunned when they told me she was 13. She was at least 5'7 and did not have the face of someone that young but lucky for me the police officer that came there remembered that she had on a ton of makeup and a very skimpy dress so they said it already didn't add up to her original story. I told the police everything that I knew and asked them what was going to happen to me now. They booked me on a crime or sex with a minor under 14 and was in jail for 2 days and the judge granted my release pending investigation. The days I spent there the police told the girl that if she doesn't tell the truth about what really happened everyone will be going to jail. She immediately broke down and told the cops her mom made her do it to teach me a lesson about how to not play with peoples feelings. Remember when I told you she all did stuff together yea that's exactly what I meant the mom was immediately arrested and charged with the exact same thing as me plus child endangerment and incest. The DA involved told me that her hands were tied since I had sex with her but that she would give me the lowest possible amount of time that the law can give me which is 3 years. It's been over 25 years since that has happened and I'm still on the registered list as a level 3 offender. This has completely ruined my personal and professional life and only very few people are understanding about what happened and kept me in their lives once I told them about it. I just want to know what people think so I still after all this time deserve to be on this list even though I've never done anything like this before or after nothing anywhere near that ever even crossed my mind to think that this would be the life I'd end up living. Like I said I know there are no matter what going to be people that will be hateful towards me no matter what but id really like to hear from others on what they think.

My name’s Nathan. Back in early August, my grandfather passed away from heart failure at 73. In Newfoundland, that’s pretty rare. Most people don’t even make it that far before heart problems catch up with them.

He was more than just a grandfather to me. He was the reason I made it through a lot of tough times after my father left when I was just 8. He did everything in his power to keep my mom and me afloat and 20 years later, he was still supporting us in every way he could, never asking for anything in return.

Hell, the only reason I didn’t know what happened to him sooner was because he was on his way to celebrate with me. I’d just landed a new job I’d been working toward for months and he wanted to mark the occasion. He hopped in his old truck to grab a small cake, but he passed away at a red light before he could even get home.

He was one of a kind. Losing him felt like part of me was ripped out, leaving a massive hole. After his burial we did what we could to sell whatever he had. House, truck, tools, we just didn’t have space for it and it took some time to pull off, it also hurt a little giving up his things.

That’s when I found his old key ring. They weren’t for his truck, he never had spares for it, but to the cabin he used to own. In Newfoundland, cabins are common. People use them to escape for a while or, for some, to go moose hunting. My grandfather wasn’t much of a hunter, but he’d slip out there every now and then to get away. I remember a few times he took me there one of those trips was when he tried to teach me to drive at 16. That lesson ended quickly when I went just a little too fast and crashed his truck into one of the trees in the area. I’m pretty sure my mom yelled at him the entire day we got back but all he cared about was that I was fine in the end.

The cabin was about an hour outside of his home town, down a dirt road that barely even qualified as a road. You could easily miss it if you weren’t looking for it. It was in the perfect spot, just far enough away from everything, surrounded by trees for cover, but still close enough to the shoreline if you felt like fishing. And now, here I was, holding the only set of keys he had for it.

I didn’t tell my mother about the cabin even though now I wish I did. But at the time, I didn’t know if the cabin had been sold, given to one of us, or just left to rot. The urge to go there one more time before it was potentially taken away from us was stronger than anything else, I had to go.

The plan was simple: I told my mother I was going out of town to meet up with an old high school friend who was getting married soon, but also to clear my head from everything so far. I would be gone for 4 days, enough time to drive there, stick around for a day or two and then drive back without her knowing. She didn’t question it, I booked the time off and I headed out when the time came.

I overpacked of course. Instead of bringing just a few days worth of food and water, I ended up with 6 days worth of water and food. I also brought a fresh bottle of Screech and enough gasoline to keep the small generator my grandfather had up there running the entire time I was there. I did all of this in the next town over just to make sure my mother wouldn’t catch me packing supplies for the cabin.

Once I had everything, I hit the road. I didn’t stop until I reached that dirt road my grandfather had used for years. I’ve always hated that road, it was so bumpy it felt like I was getting whiplash every few minutes. My forgotten cold coffee didn’t stand a chance the moment I got on that dirt road, flying everywhere within the first few minutes and making a mess I couldn’t clean up until I was done getting to the cabin.

Even after all these years seeing the cabin still standing felt surreal. Its bright blue exterior stuck out against the surrounding trees. It wasn’t big, but that was part of its charm. All you needed in a cabin like this was a place to sit, cook, eat, sleep, and well...shit. Anything beyond that was an unnecessary luxury.

Behind the cabin, my grandfather had a small shed where he kept his tools and the generator that powered the lights and mini-fridge. The generator could run for about 10 hours, but I wasn’t planning on running it that long but if I did I brought enough gas to make it last, especially for some late night drinking.

I stepped up to the door, unlocked it and swung it wide open to let in the fresh air. Inside there was a small countertop on the right, enough space to prepare food, and a makeshift sink made from a cheap bucket and a couch to the side tucked into the corner of the cabin’s living room. No plumbing of course, we always had to bring our own water for drinking and washing. There was also a makeshift shower near the shed and an old outhouse a little further out which I had to spray down with bug repellent. The bathroom built in the cabin was nothing more than a seat with a bucket for those frigid winter nights if you didn’t want to freeze your ass off in the snow. No one used it as a bathroom honestly so we just used it as a small storage room.

The cabin only had four windows. One in the front, one in front of the kitchen sink and 2 small ones in the bedroom and bathroom. My grandfather didn’t keep much here, there was a small coffee table, a loveseat and two folding chair. The centerpiece of the cabin, though, was the old wood stove, which had probably been there longer than my grandfather. It was a sturdy and heavy wood stove with a flat top to boil your water for tea or cook any meal you wanted. He always preferred to cook on that thing then any electric stove top we brought even if it meant burning everything that touched it.

There was one other thing in the cabin I had to check though, one thing my grandfather showed me and told me to keep a secret even from my mother. Once you move the couch out of the way you could find two boards in the wall that stuck out from the others that were not nailed in but screwed into the wall. A quick twist with an old screwdriver and I had access to my grandfather’s rifle he had tucked away in the wall for safekeeping.

He knew all about Canadian gun laws and the need to keep ammo and weapons separate, but he didn’t care much for the rules. The rifle he owned wasn’t registered and it was an old Ross rifle, the same kind used by the Newfoundland military in World War 1. The fact that he had one and it still worked amazed me. ""It came with the cabin,"" he told me once, which made me question just how old this cabin really was. I knew the cabin had been fixed up a long time ago but old enough to last since World War 1? For now I just screwed the boards back on and left the rifle there, I had no reason to have it out right now and tucked the couch back in its place to hide it.

Once I was done inspecting the inside of the cabin and headed back outside to grab everything I packed, it was then it started to happen. I didn’t notice the hook hanging there dead center to the door when I was leaving and right away it sliced the right side of my face right on my cheek. It stung like hell and touching where it cut me I could already feel a small bit of blood on my finger tips. I wasn’t sure where it came from but I remember thinking to myself how much it would suck to leave just for a tetanus shot.

I grabbed the line that the hook was attached to, wrapping it around my hand, and gave it a tug, trying to pull it free from wherever it was tied to. But the more I tugged, the less sense it made. I figured it was probably attached to the wall or maybe even the roof for some strange reason but every time I pulled it felt a little to loose

Finally with one good yank I ripped it free, the long, nearly invisible line, dropped in front of me. It was much longer than it should’ve been. I could’ve easily wrapped it around the entire cabin without a problem. I figured it was just an extra bit of line left by my grandfather, or whoever had put it up, who hadn’t bothered to trim it down. I coiled it up, tied it off, and tossed it beside the front door for later. I’d deal with it properly once I was done unpacking the truck.

I was exhausted. I needed food and thanks to that damn hook, a band aid. Unpacking was quick, even setting up the gas generator my grandfather had was easy enough. Once everything was inside and the generator was roaring, I got to work cleaning up and eventually cooked myself dinner. When night rolled around and I was ready to sleep. As much as I wanted to stay awake a little longer my body was begging for a nap after being on the road for so long. So I slipped outside, turned off the generator for the night and headed to the cabin door.

As soon as I reached the door I spotted something at the very edge of my sight. It was pretty dark outside but I could have sworn I saw something at the tree line, so I grabbed my phone and turned on the flashlight mode, pointing it in the direction I saw whatever it was.

To my surprise I could make out what looked like a moose standing in the distance. Newfoundland is known for its moose population, there are so many now that they’ve become a real problem, especially for drivers. But this was the first time I’d seen a moose near the cabin like this. Now thinking about it, I think this was the first time I’ve seen any animal near the cabin and there was a full grown moose in the distance, maybe looking in my direction.

I quietly stepped inside, locked the door and brushed it off. I didn’t think much of it at the time. I was tired and my only focus was getting to bed to enjoy my time at the cabin for the next few days. I had a plan and no moose was going to stop me at this point.

The next morning I was still partly waking up when I went outside to grab some wood for the stove. I was already craving a cup of tea and as I made my way toward the back of the cabin I felt another sudden sting, this time from the top of my right hand. This one stung like hell. I think it was the jolt from it that made me jerk my hand away and made things worse as the hook poked through the other end of my skin. This one was a lot thicker compared to the first one that got me and it stung like hell.

Looking at the hook embedded in my skin only made the pain worse. I knew I had to break the line before I could do anything else and coiled it up a bit in my left hand to give it a tug, trying to pull it free.

Nothing.

In fact, it felt like the line was pulling back slightly as I tried again. I couldn’t figure out where it was tied, but I kept pulling thinking it was probably attached to the roof or something. It didn't take me long to realize the line wasn’t attached to the roof at all this time.

The line was coming from the sky.

For a second I convinced myself the wind must’ve blown it out from a tree or something. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me, making it look like the line was hanging from the sky. But deep down I knew what I was looking at and I won’t lie, it scared the hell out of me.

I gathered all my strength and pulled on the line until it snapped much like the first one I found. This line was longer though. I didn’t waste any time and headed inside to grab my pliers. I needed to cut the hook off thanks to the barbed end it had, if I just pulled it out it would just rip through my skin more than anything, but with the hook being thicker this time it took a bit out of me to just cut it in half. I did thankfully, pulling both pieces out and throwing it into the trash.

I wasn’t sure whether I should get it checked out. It was a pretty big hook and who knew how long it had been there? But I also did want to just leave and waste an entire day getting it checked out either. I decided to check my phone and see if I could find a quick answer. Instead I was greeted with no signal, forgetting I was in the middle of the woods where it would be pure luck to get one out here.

I walked all around the inside of the cabin for the smallest signal at first before heading outside, checking every spot near there for anything before finally finding one spot that worked. It was just outside the kitchen window when I spotted the small signal bar pop up and allowed me very slow access to the internet again.

I must have been out there for a little while looking for some kind of quick answer when something caught my eye and nearly jumped out of my skin when I noticed it finally, just barely catching my phone in the process.

About 20 to 30 feet from the cabin, there was a moose, maybe the same one from the night before. It was standing motionless in the thicker part of the trees, just staring in my direction. What really shook me though was how quiet it was.

If you’ve ever seen a moose, you know how loud they can be. These massive animals are hard to miss, especially where the trees are packed together in places. A moose moving around will always make some noise. But this one? It was dead silent.

Something kept telling me in the back of my head that something wasn’t right, something about this moose just felt off as I made my way to the corner of the cabin, my eyes locked on it as I did. The moment I reached the corner I was greeted with something else, another hook. This one thankfully caught the sleeve of my shirt as I tried to walk away. My immediate instinct was to pull away, let it tear through my shirt and just not worry about it, the moment I did I watched as the hook came free before suddenly being pulled straight up into the air and out of sight. I didn’t know what I just saw at first and just stood there trying to see where it went. 

Where it went was up into the sky.

It must have clicked in my head shortly after because when it did I bolted to the cabin door. Something wasn’t right about this cabin suddenly and my first reaction to it all was getting the fuck out of there. I wasn’t going to stick around and find out what the hell was going on, I was going to leave and find out later if I could. I raced back inside and grabbed one of the empty bags I had brought with me, packing it with whatever I could without any real knowledge of what I was grabbing. I was more spooked by this than I thought I was now thinking about it, but god I wished I moved a little faster when I started.

I didn’t even care about the generator. I figured I would leave it, let it run itself out of gas and the problem solved .The need to go back there and shut everything down properly was being overrun by the need to simply leave. I was nearly done packing the bags when I heard it, the kitchen window shattering into a thousand pieces. Glass and wood was thrown into the cabin so suddenly I thought something had exploded behind me, making me jolt away from the sound before turning to it.

The damn moose was there, I knew it was because the moment I looked toward the window I could see just the smallest piece of its antlers poking inside before it pulled it back outside. Before I could react I heard another window smash, then another. For whatever reason the moose outside had smashed almost all of the windows and yet I still could not hear anything from it, not a single step.

""Fuck this,"" I remember muttering to myself.

I shoved the couch out of the way with all my mite and kicked the wall where the boards hid it, shattering them with one good kick. If I had to kill a moose to get out of there then god damn it, that’s what I was going to do.

I grabbed the rifle and grabbed one of the already loaded clips for it. Loading the rifle was difficult but I managed in the end, pulling the slide back then forward again to get it ready. I haven’t used it that much but my grandfather showed me how to properly use it before, nothing changed since then.

I figured if the moose was anywhere it would be near the shed, it did smash out the bedroom and bathroom windows which were close to it so that was where I would check first. With the butt of the rifle to my shoulder i swung the front door open and made my way towards the back end of the cabin. As I got closer I could finally start hearing it or something at least. Something banging on the other side. With a loud pop and bang I realized what it was. The moose was slamming its head into the generator and had killed it. Why the hell it was doing that I had no idea, but I knew I had to act fast.

Reaching the corner of the cabin I was finally in sight of the damn thing but god do i wish I never did now. The moose, this hulking beast of an animal stood tall over the now dead generator, raising its head up high now that it was done beating it to death before slowly turning its head towards me.

One of its antlers had snapped off at the base from repeatedly slamming it into the generator, leaving just a sharp stub sticking out of its head. But that was nothing compared to the rest of the sight.

Its fur was patchy, missing in some places, revealing pale raw skin beneath with spots of rot and decay. The moment it had turned its head towards me I could see a part of its lip was hanging loose, bits and pieces of it torn up and with old blood gunk up. And it’s eyes, god those nearly pure white eyes staring blankly back at me as it stood there.

This moose had been dead for some time now and holding it up were hundreds, maybe thousands of these hooks and lines scattered all across its body, suspending it upwards like a puppet with its feet never actually touching the ground, only looking like it was even on the ground to begin with. All of these super thin lines shot straight up into the air like all of the other ones I had seen by then, controlling every movement this moose made. No wonder it looked off to me when I first spotted it.

I stood there frozen, rifle aimed at the abomination before me, its hollow eyes met mine and in that moment, time felt like it stopped. My breath was trapped in my chest, my hands cold as ice as I held that rifle. I squeezed the trigger before I even understood what was going on and watched as the round landed right into the thing's right eye with a small wet pop before exiting the other side, a small bit of old gunk up blood pouring out where the eye once was. There was no reaction, no twitch, no flinch, nothing. It simply stood there, unfeeling, unaffected by the shot that would have killed most mooseI. I reacted by cocking the gun, pulling then pushing the slide back in place to ready another round as it kept its dead sight on me. The next round hit its rib cage, a small splatter of blood but no exit wound this time as I cocked the rifle yet again.

The best way I can explain how this thing moved is again like a puppeteer simply swung it towards me, lunging forward and forcing myself to jump back out of its reach as it slammed into the corner of the cabin. It bounced off the corner of the cabin like some crazed marionette, its movement odd and awkward at the same time as the hooks attached to it guided it back my way. In my moment of panic I walked quickly backwards, trying to get the rifle up fast enough to take another shot as the gun let out another snap

The bullet hit the rotten piece of the moose's back and I watched as it tore a large chunk off and shot straight up into the sky like trash caught in high winds. The amount of lines and hooks that went with it must have off-balanced the thing, shifting its weight to the side as it once again rammed into the cabin wall with an unsettling force where it paused for a brief moment. I remember my hands were shaky but not enough for me to cock the rifle one more time. The moment the next round was ready I watched in horror as this massive dead beast was simply pulled up into the air and out of sight. It was simply gone.

I frantically looked everywhere for that thing, unsure if it was just gone or waiting for me to fuck up and surprise me. It took me a bit but I considered everything in the cabin a lose as I made a mad dash for the truck, rifle in my left hand while right hand dug in my pocket for the keys, panic making everything so much harder to find them. I had just barely managed to pull the keys free when it returned.

It plummeted from the sky like some sort of twisted Ferris wheel, crashing into the side of the truck with a deafening impact. The impact drove the truck nearly seven feet to the side with enough force to almost flip it on to its side, I was mere inches away from it when it hit the door, forcing me to leap back and fall on my ass before stumbling back to my feet again.

The moose was barely unrecognizable. Both of its shattered antlers were almost nearly gone at this point and the remnants of its skin clung to its body in patches, revealing broken bones, exposed ribs and rotting flesh. Fragments of its skull and ribcage jutted from its body like broken shards of glass.

I tried to raise my rifle once more but before I could fire it was on me. The force slammed into me, pushing me backward until my back crashed into the cabin window and shattering the glass in an instant. The rifle slipped from my hands, and in that brief moment of disorientation, I struggled to catch my breath. There was no time to think, no time to plan, no time to wait. I did the only thing I could, I ran back inside. I sprinted back inside my heart pounding and reached the makeshift sink as the creature crashed into the door. It hit with such force that the wood exploded, splintering and cracking as it attempted to force its way inside. The only way for me to explain the situation was like watching someone control a puppet and trying to make them walk into a small house where the strings could get into, making parts of its limbs just drop and act dead on the spot as the lines attached to it dug into the wood. It struggled to get inside for a while before becoming lifeless, dead in its spot. It didn’t take long before all of the hooks and line attached to the corpse dragged it back outside and straight up in the air once again, not a sound to be made.

The best way I could describe what I was witnessing was like watching someone manipulate a puppet trying to force it to walk into a tiny house, the strings tangled and got caught in the roof and ceiling, causing parts of the puppet’s limbs to suddenly go limp and hang dead as the lines pulled tight against the wood. It struggled for a while, trying to force itself inside but eventually it went completely still, lifeless, frozen in place like a real corpse. It didn’t take long before the hooks and strings that had been attached to its body yanked it back out, lifting it up into the air without a single sound.

I stood there in silence overlooking the chaos that was left behind by this thing, splattering of old rotting blood, small bits and pieces of fur and flesh along with scattered wood and glass from the window and door. My breath was fast, still catching up to everything that happened moments before the silence as I took a few steps forward to look outside. I kept a bit of distance from the doorway still, giving myself enough space in case it came back with another surprise attack as I scanned the area. There was nothing, just dead silence.

That silence lasted only a moment before a loud and sudden *BANG* echoed from outside the cabin as a round from the rifle went off and ripped through the wall beside me before ending up inside the kitchen wall on the other side. Wherever the corpse went it had taken the rifle straight up with it before hitting the ground with such force to set off the loaded round live in the chamber. Won't lie, I think I pissed myself from that honestly.

After both near death experiences I ran to the couch and shoved it in front of the front door before grabbed the old bed and propping it up against the window as well, blocking any sight of that beast if it was to come back before tucking myself into the very corner the couch was in before all of this. It was the safest place in my mind, furthest from the windows and door leading outside where that thing could potentially get me.

I was stuck in this cabin.

I didn’t dare to try and leave as the hours dragged on, day became night and I risked it to get to the wood stove to light it up, giving me some better vision of the area around me inside the cabin. I barely moved, stunned by everything that had led to this as the realization I was stuck here started to leak into my mind. There was nothing I could do but sit here and wait, waiting for something to happen as I made the bottle of Screech my only friend in this world now.

My truck was completely fucked after what that thing did to it and it was the only safe way for me to get out of this place. I couldn’t just run away with a corpse like that flying around here to pounce when it was time, plus how many of those hooks were outside as well? I only bumped into a few of them and all I know they could be anywhere. I was stuck here. I must have drank half the bottle that night, pausing every moment I heard something outside or mumbling to myself about things long past. Did my grandfather know about this? What was controlling that thing outside attacking me? Should I leave a message in case someone finds me? I had so many thoughts running through my mind as I sat there, the glow of the wood stove lighting the room around me as I checked my phone for the time. I don’t remember much in that moment being piss drunk, but seeing my phone somehow gave me the idea of calling for help. I had to shake my drunken mind away and really think of how I was going to pull this off. If I could get a single 911 call out maybe, just maybe I could get someone here to save me. It was a long shot but it was the only shot I had, the only real problem was getting a signal. I knew where I could get even a small one, but that's what made it so much worse to think about it. It was my only chance to get out of here and I had to at the very least try.

My body felt heavy, exhausted even the more I tried to get myself up off the floor, a plan set in stone but unsure if I can even pull it off. Out the kitchen window was all I needed to reach out to, that was all I had to do. I can pre-dial the number and wait until i got a signal before pressing ‘Call’ on the phone to try and contact someone to help, but the more I looked towards the shattered kitchen window the more fearful I became, frightened of that thing just being around the corner and hitting when I was at my weakest.

My hands were shaking as I got the phone ready, only 10% power left was enough to get a phone call out as I dialed in the number. I kept my thumb over the ‘Call’ button on the screen as I crept up to the window and slowly stretched my right arm little by little outside of the wrecked frame. I kept scanning the area, keeping an eye out for the corpse to return and attack me as I reached further and further outside. My hope was fading pretty quickly the further i stretched myself out that window, trying not to cut myself on the glass until I saw it, a green signal bar popping up on the top right of the screen as I press ‘Call’ on the screen. The relief that overcame when I heard the sound of the phone ringing was like a rush, but only for a moment.

The phone slipped from my grasp as a surge of pain coursed through me intense and blinding, as though every nerve ending in my arm was being pulled and twisted. I looked down in horror to see hooks anchoring into my skin, spreading from my shoulder all the way to my fingertips piercing deeper with each pull. Instinctively I tried to wrench myself free, but the hooks resisted, tugging me back with a violent force instead. If my left arm hadn’t been braced against the cabin, I would’ve been dragged right out, pulled into the dark with no hope of escape. The pain was so overwhelming that for a moment I thought I might collapse from sheer agony. 

The pain was unbearable, it felt like I was being ripped apart little by little. Even though I was fighting for my life something in my mind shifted from being frightened to fighting back. I wasn’t going to be some puppet, dragged away and strung up like that damn moose, I was going to get away from this one way or another. With every ounce of strength I had I started to pull with all my might, intense pain jolting through me more and more as I pulled but I couldn’t stop.

I managed to get my foot up on the wall for leverage, giving me extra strength to work with as I started to pull with everything I had. I yanked myself back inside, my body slammed against the floor and came to a stop in the corner where the couch once was as my breathing became ragged, exhaustion taking over me as I laid there.

As the adrenaline started to fade that’s when I felt the full force of the pain.  I had to pull myself up with my left arm before seeing my right arm shredded to pieces. Strips of skin were missing all the way from my shoulder to my fingers, on top of that I had pulled with such force I lost the top of my middle finger and my ring finger, only half of them remained. Blood was rushing with the beat of my heart and as my heart rated increased I had to do what I could in pure agony

The moment was a blur to me, a bad panic of trying to stop the bleeding while thoughts of bleeding out ran through my mind. What I do remember was one idea of just pouring the remaining bottle of Screech over the wounds and shoving my arm into the wood stove, burning the wounds closed to stop the bleeding, but even I knew that was a terrible idea and would have only made more problems. Instead I must have just wrapped it up the best I could and poured I think what was rubbing alcohol all over the cloth I used which turned out to be a bed sheet and a t-shirt before passing out from that alone. Time was a blur at that point. I remember laying on that floor for a long while, other times I remember struggling to open and cook canned and bottle goods I brought with me. I think I even wrote a letter to my mother at one point fearing that I wasn't coming out of this alive. I didn’t think I was at that time. The final night I do remember pretty clearly. The pain in my right arm started to get worse as I laid there may be either half dead or half asleep. The fire in the wood stove had died out and the only thing I could hear was the rustling of the trees from the wind outside. I was ready for death to take me as I laid there but the longer I waited the more light I started to notice. I thought I was hallucinating when this all happened, it wasn’t until I heard the officers voice yell out before coming inside.

Before I knew it I was waking up in a hospital bed, the lights nearly blinding me when I finally woke up. The RCMP officer who spoke to me in the hospital explained that my 911 call did get through. They heard a struggle on the line, but the call dropped before they could track it down properly. They had only a vague idea of where the cabin was, which is why it took them so long to find me. But they found me, just in time.

I told them everything. The hooks, the moose, the damage to my arm, everything. I’m not sure if they believed me but they knew something had happened. The doctors said I was lucky I didn’t bleed out from how much was torn away on my arm. The doctor probably didn’t buy my story either, but that didn’t matter. All he needed to do was help me recover.

I stayed in the hospital for a while. I was too terrified to leave and was convinced that whatever attacked me was still out there. My fear kept me in that sterile room an extra day or two, even though I was physically well enough to go. It wasn’t until my mother insisted I leave that I finally agreed in hesitation and I went to stay with her for a few more days before heading back to my own home.

It's been 7 months since then. 

Writing all of this down has been difficult and doing what I just did was even harder. Part of me wants to believe it was just some twisted figment of my imagination, a way for my mind to shield me from what really happened. But I know what I saw.

The hardest part? I can’t prove any of it anymore.

The cabin is gone.

I just returned from driving out there, hoping for any shred of evidence that it was real. But when I got there it was gone. No remains, no pieces of the cabin, just nothing. It was as if it had never existed. I called everyone in the area and no one knew anything about it, not even the RCMP, who’d investigated the site days after they found me. According to them, the cabin should still be there.

But it wasn’t.

The only thing I found was a single, small fishing hook, tightly tied to a frail line.",0,1741496306.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

So, I’ve been living with my roommate for a while now, and at first, everything seemed normal. We got along well—maybe even too well. They were always super considerate, always available to help me with anything, and always seemed to know what I needed before I even asked.

At first, I thought they were just being a great friend. But then, weird things started happening.

For example, they always know exactly where I am, even when I don’t tell them. I’ll casually mention that I went to a specific coffee shop, and they’ll be like, “Oh yeah, I saw you there!” or “I figured you’d go there today.” But… how?

Then, I started noticing little things around my room being slightly moved when I got home—nothing major, just enough to make me wonder if someone had been in there. I started testing it by leaving something in a very specific place, and sure enough, it would be slightly off when I came back.

One night, I woke up to the feeling of being watched. My door was open just a crack, and I swear I saw their shadow standing there before they quickly moved away. I confronted them about it, and they just laughed it off, saying they “thought they heard something” and were “checking in on me.”

The scariest part? I found a notebook in the common area with my name written all over it. It was filled with notes about things I had said, places I had gone, and even little doodles of me. When I asked them about it, they turned bright red, grabbed the notebook, and mumbled something about “just writing for fun.”

I don’t know what to do. Part of me wonders if I’m overreacting, but another part of me feels like this is going too far. I don’t want to escalate things, but I also don’t feel safe.

I plan to take my first solo trip to Kerala going across places like kochi, alleppey, Varkala, and maybe munnar. Can you help me with sharing if you've been to kerala, which are the 2-3 places I can visit at each destination, I'll be staying at each for 1-2 days. I am mostly going to Kerala for beach, I have never seen a beach (unless one in Diu for 2 hours lol). I love colorful sunsets, starry skies and coconut trees. so any places where the best sunset can be seen. 

Also, any suggestions where I can shop some clothes (flowy dresses that give beach vibes ) when I'm there. I also plan to travel via train to kerala so if you can suggest which station I should see and how I can plan my itenary accordingly. 

Also, I love landscape scenes shown in movie like Kummati so if someone can help me, where I can find those landscapes? I am not much into drinks/temples/coffee so not looking for those suggestions. 

As someone sho has lived most of thier live in north or western India, I mostly wanna see the serene natural beauty of kerala. And maybe do stargazing.

A website costs money, but how much, ah? Finding ""affordable web design"" feels tricky, like finding good coffee cheap. ""Affordable"" means different things to different peoples. Price changes with many things. I will tell you the price ranges for ways of web design.

Many things change web design costs. A small, simple site cost less than a big one. A site with many pages, many features, and custom code cost more. Is your design special? Custom design is costly. Using a normal pattern save money. Does site need contact form? blog, or an online shop? These things make cost go up. Who writes the words and takes the pictures? You or the designer? If designer does, the cost is more, ah? Also, search engine optimization costs some money to set up. Site Maintenance costs, also the place on the internet where site lives, all things change the price. Lastly, experienced designer also costs more than new designer. All these things add to the cost.

Websites from places like Wix is cheap way to go. You pay small amount each month. Easy to use, they have drag and drop feature. You see many templates, so, no code. But, they can look common. Not much special. Not much changes you can make.

Then come templates you can change. Many use WordPress. Many theme selections you have. More change than DIY. Need some knowledge, or person with knowledge.

You want a very special design? Hire person. A freelancer. Direct communication, and prices can be lower than big company. Finding reliable freelancer, is very hard. Can be problem.

Last big company or agency. Project handling very good. Experienced persons. But cost more money. Changes not happen fast like freelancer.

So, you see. Many price ranges. WordPress very common. Many use it. DIY easy, but changes very little. Content is big cost factor. Online shop costs more than normal site.

Now come new things. No-code platform help build website quicker. Mobile website is must now. Make site secure is must, because of hackers. All must now. Cost increases because of these.

Know what you want before you look. If you write your own content, then good, save money. Look at normal patterns. Then get quotes. Don't think you can get good website for very cheap. First you use essential, and then you can add more, ah? Then, negotiate.

So, think of it. ""Affordable"" doesn't mean ""cheap"". Think of long run, of getting value.

My ex-girlfriend, let’s call her Sarah, broke up with me about two years ago. We were together for almost three years, and I thought we were solid. I wasn’t rich, but I had a decent job, treated her well, and we had a good life together—or so I thought.

Then, out of nowhere, she hits me with the “I love you, but I need to think about my future” speech. A month later, I see her on Instagram living it up in luxury—fancy vacations, expensive dinners, designer bags—the works. Turns out, she had left me for some finance bro who was making six figures and showering her with gifts.

It hurt, not gonna lie. But I moved on. I focused on myself, got a promotion, and even started seeing someone new. Life was good.

Fast forward to last week, and guess who slides into my DMs? Yep, Sarah. She starts with some small talk, then gets into the whole “I’ve been thinking about you a lot” and “I miss what we had” speech. I was confused until I did some light social media stalking. Turns out, rich finance bro wasn’t as perfect as she thought—he cheated on her with multiple women, got caught in some shady business deals, and lost a ton of money. Now, instead of private jets, she’s posting about “humble new beginnings” and “real love over material things.”

She straight-up asked if we could meet for coffee. I haven’t responded yet, but I can’t help but laugh at the irony. She left me for money, got played, and now that she’s struggling, she wants to rekindle what we had? Nah, I’m good.

What do you guys think? Should I hear her out just for the drama, or leave her in the past where she belongs? 

Title: “My Family Left Me with 3 Cousins and Went to Hawaii—Now They’re in Jail, and Everyone Hates Me”

Okay, so here’s the situation. A few weeks ago, my parents and some other family members decided to take a vacation to Hawaii. Sounds great, right? Well, not for me—because instead of taking me with them, they left me behind with three of my younger cousins (all under 12).

I’m not an adult. I’m not a babysitter. And I definitely didn’t agree to this. But they just up and left, assuming I’d take care of everything while they were off sipping cocktails on a beach.

At first, I thought maybe they had a backup plan, like a neighbor checking in or money for food. Nope. They just dumped the kids on me with zero instructions. After about a day, I realized how serious this was—these kids needed actual care, food, supervision, and I had school to worry about.

So I called my dad and told him to come back now, or I was calling the cops. He laughed it off and told me to “relax.” That’s when I went ahead and made the call.

CPS and the police got involved, and long story short, my parents (and a few other family members) got arrested for child abandonment. Now, my entire family is blowing up my phone, calling me every name in the book. They’re saying I “ruined their lives” and that I should have just “handled it like family.”

I don’t think I did anything wrong, but now I’m completely ostracized. Everyone is mad at me, and I don’t know what to do.

I retired in 2018 and gave up my hobby farm dream to live a mile from them.  

2023, i started cooking for them and stacking plastic trays they could microwave.  

My father died May 3 officially, but I know he died at 23:55 on May 2.  I know this because I gave him his final hospice medication at 2350 and there was a baby monster in the room and he gave this sigh and then I knew he was gone. 

I was there 3 to 5 days a week, but five days a week at the very end

My sister and my oldest niece also came down because I told him that my father was dying and their response to my father‘s death was to rob the house.  Because the Care Taker lady was shocked because it was not even like 30 minutes before my father was declared dead by the hospice nurse and my sister and my oldest niece said where is the will and what do we get?

My father told me to take out this one strong box and also all the documents which also included the well. They ransacked my parents house.  My mother even made it comment. She’s like somebody has ransacked my closet.

I took care of my mother, leaving my home and staying at her home for about five or six months and it broke me mentally and physically.  A good neighbor knew I was about two weeks from my mother going to a care facility.  I was outside smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee… Because even though my own home, I don’t smoke in my home.   

But she came over and she saw my hand shaking and she’s like you’re done. I will sleep over in the house with your mother. You could be here during the day.  Because I also showed her recordings from the baby monitor of my mother and her behavior.  

My mother with dementia broke me physically and mentally.  

My mother is now in a memory care facility.  It is expensive, but it is also very good. My sister and her evil brood told me I should have been able to take care of her and I’m just pissing away their money.  

However, since I have power of attorney and also many many conversations with my father and my mother, my mother is in the best place possible at this memory care place.  

However, I visit her three times a week and this lady who is like in activities Director Toby you know what three times a week is too much you’re basically destroying yourself  she said once a week is what I would ask my kids to visit me and if you do twice a week, you’re a hero and three times a week you are just killing yourself.

Recently, I came across gated NA plots near the Mumbai-Pune toll and started exploring the idea of building a **studio apartment + dorm-based Airbnb setup** that also offers **co-working options**.

# Plan & Property Details:

* **Location:** Near Mumbai-Pune expressway toll (easy access to both cities)
* **Plot Size:** 3,258 sq. ft. (FSI 1.4)
* **Concept:** Mix of **studio apartments & dorms** for short- and long-term stays
* **Proposed Build:**
   * **6 Studio Apartments** (250 sq. ft. each)
   * **4 Dorm Rooms** (4 beds per room, total 16 dorm beds)
   * **Co-working space** \+ terrace café for additional revenue

# Breakdown of Space Usage

|**Component**|**Units**|**Size Per Unit**|**Total Area (sq. ft.)**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Studio Apartments**|6|250 sq. ft.|**1,500 sq. ft.**|
|**Dorm Rooms**|4|250 sq. ft.|**1,000 sq. ft.**|
|**Co-working Space**|1|500 sq. ft.|**500 sq. ft.**|
|**Terrace Café + Kitchen**|1|400 sq. ft.|**400 sq. ft.**|
|**Common Areas (Lobby, Stairs, Storage, Reception)**|\-|\-|**500-600 sq. ft.**|
|**Total Approx. Area**|\-|\-|**4,500 sq. ft.**|

# Pricing Structure (Airbnb & Long-Term Stay):

**Studio:**

* ₹3,500 per night
* ₹15,000 per week
* ₹45,000 per month

**Dorm Bed:**

* ₹1,200 per night
* ₹6,000 per week
* ₹20,000 per month 

**Weekends:** 2x for weekend and holiday stays.

# Additional Revenue Options:

* **Co-Working Memberships:** Free or Day passes + monthly options
* **Food & Coffee:** Simple menu for guests & co-working visitors
* **Office Room Rental:** For meetings/work sessions

# Estimated Revenue (Assuming ~60% Occupancy):

* **Studios:** ₹3-4L/month
* **Dorms:** ₹3-4L/month
* **Co-Working & Extras:** ₹1-2L/month
* **Total Potential Revenue:** ₹9-10L/month

**Assuming 2-3L for salaries and maintenance:** 7-8L/month

I’d love feedback from **real estate investors, Airbnb hosts, and travelers** on whether this model makes sense, and if there are things I should tweak before proceeding.

Would **this kind of stay appeal to you** if you were working remotely near Mumbai-Pune? What would make it better?

The gated community has other built in amenities like Gym, Swimming Pool etc. 

My goal is to make it a place where aspiring entrpreneurs, solopreneurs aspire to stay at and once popularity increases, due to limited options I can increase the prices a lot.

The place is also just 25 mins drive from **Phoenix Mall of Millenium** and other places of interests and yet closer to nature.

# Cost Breakdown: Land + Building

# 1. Land Cost

* **Plot Size:** 3,258 sq. ft.
* **FSI:** 1.4 (Buildable area = **4,561 sq. ft.**)
* **Land Price:** \~₹1.3 Cr including taxes

# 2. Construction Cost (Based on Mumbai-Pune area rates)

* **Basic Construction:** ₹1,800 – ₹2,500 per sq. ft. (for good quality)
* **Premium Construction (Airbnb standards, better interiors):** ₹2,500 – ₹3,500 per sq. ft.

Let's assume **₹2,500 per sq. ft.** for a well-designed setup.

* **Total Buildable Area:** \~4,561 sq. ft.
* **Construction Cost:** 4,561 × ₹2,500 = **₹1.14 Cr**

Like the title says, I just need to voice this stuff, and I can’t find the energy to say any of it out loud. 

Trigger warnings for family death, pet death and body dysmorphia? Idk if I need to put this here but I don’t want me venting to make someone else feel worse. 

I (24 F) have had the year from hell. My ex and I (25 M) were together for a little over a year. While it wasn’t perfect, and in a small way I’m really glad we broke up because I know it wasn’t right, he blindsided me by dumping me the day he came back from a month long work trip. He just point blank said he didn’t love me enough to want to continue (we were likely looking at doing long distance in a year due to our jobs) It absolutely crushed me, I had seen myself marrying him. As I sat there trying to pick myself back up, I started realizing he didn’t seem to actually love me at all, and frankly, I’m not entirely sure he even really liked me. I think I was a project. He wanted me to change my hair, change my style, lose weight, get more muscular, start liking all the stuff he liked (we had a lot in common in the first place but he wanted me to be way more into his niche interests) but he’d put down all of my things. When we started dating it was perfect, and it stayed perfect for about 3-4 months, then slowly, the nit-picking started. Little comments about my appearance or my hobbies, specifically my weight and even little things I had been insecure about that he seemed to pick up on and drill over and over have broken something in me I didn’t think could be broken. I feel like my ability to like who I am and what I look like has been taken, and I don’t know how to get it back. 

The same day as this break up, I get the call that my grandfather, who I am very close with, has cancer again. His health was always a battle from before I was even born, but he defied the odds and came out okay every time. This time, from my research, I knew this wasn’t going to be the case. He had an 8% chance of making it two years. They said with aggressive treatment he could get 5. He took the chance but the treatment was too much, we lost him in January. I held his hand as he died and I’m not sure I can ever truly recover from that, he basically suffocated in front of me and it was the worst thing I’ve ever seen. I’m in nursing school, and I’ve seen some really rough stuff, but it’s different when it’s the guy who helped raise you. I’m trying to keep it together for my mom and my grandma but it’s haunting me. I either can’t feel anything and I’m completely fine like he isn’t gone or I’m sobbing out of the blue. My grandma is devastated, and seeing her like this is so horrible. I miss him and I want her to be happy and I know she won’t be without him, he was her person and he always will be. She was in a really serious car accident with my uncle on the way to the service for my grandpa (they’re luckily both okay but her car is totaled, someone broadsided them) and hearing she had been in an accident so soon after was so scary.  My grandpa was so scared to leave my grandma alone, he didn’t want to leave us but the thought of leaving his ‘sunshine girl’ was the only thing that really scared him even when he knew that he was dying and it wasn’t going to be peaceful. He was in pain, and the doctors said even when he was unconscious his brain registered he was suffocating. I don’t know why the hell they felt the need to tell us that, I think they were trying to motivate us to shut off his bipap. I wish he could’ve left us in peace, I’m scared we made him suffer. 

And finally, my cat (4 yrs) died in November. I noticed he was breathing a little weirdly, so I took him into the vet. 8k, 3 vets, missed classes, 9 medications (11 doses a day), and so many tests, pleural drains, and watching him wheeze and be in pain have just kicked my ass down an emotional staircase covered in broken glass. That cat is my baby. He was my soulmate. He was only 4, and he suffered so much. He hissed at me and hid before he died, he wouldn’t even sleep in bed with me (he did every night) the night before we had to put him down. I had to drag him out (we did it at my home) from under the coffee table growling to do the shot. He died in my arms, I felt him die. I don’t really remember much of that moment, my mom just said I started wailing. I remember screaming no and seeing his eyes do the thing people’s eyes do when they die. I have 2 kittens now I ended up with by chance, and I love them, but I miss my boy every day. I’m so thankful for these kittens but I’m so used to my lazy snuggly big boy that having two kittens who are very crazy and energetic is whip lash, even a few months into having them. 

As I said, I’m a nursing student and all of this happening this semester combined with the course load being insane is making me feel like I’m losing my mind. I’ve been shoving it down so far, but I had a really hard day in a clinical shift today and before I knew it I was having a full blown panic attack just thinking about it. I’m off my game, missing things, sleeping through alarms, getting sick often, not focusing, not getting the grades I know I’m capable of easily, not connecting with my cohort like I want to, and not feeling like I’m in control of my life. I just had another good cry, the combination of lack of sleep, lack of food, and stress right now are making everything feel so much more horrible than it is, but yeah. 

If you read through all of this, thank you. I don’t expect any help, I’m not really sure what anyone could do (unless you’re a necromancer with the cure to cancer as well as a cat heart surgeon and you can summon my future husband from somewhere in the ether) but somehow just saying everything to someone somewhere has made me feel a little better.

His mother is constantly late to everything, even plans that were booked ahead of time and paid for. One time she picked me up, because I didn't have my license at the time, to go to a restaurant with my fiance and her. We arrived 4 hours late. I was texting my fiance apologizing every 30 mins we were late. Why we were late? She wanted to stop here and there everytime she had a little desire to buy a coffee or something she didn't need. I was so mad at her but I was kind to her anyway.  (This type of thing had happened several times before, including the day I first met her as my fiance's girlfriend). 

Another problem I have is that her father is still alive. He's in his late 90's and needs constant care. My fiance, her son and his grandson, takes care of him a lot while when she takes care of her own father she yells at him and embarrasses him for being old and sick and incompetent. Her father is such a sweet man and you can tell he feels so insignificant and unimportant to everyone because of the way she treats him.

Considering those two things and my wedding, im afraid she'll be late. I have no intention of saving her a seat at the front of the ceremony venue if she is late, she will have to sit in the back with the rest of the guests. (I know it's like ""but it's her son getting married"", she talks being his back and says the cruelest things about him to not only me but everyone. She's also made him and her roles reversed since his childhood. In my fiance's words, he feels like he's her parent emotionally because she's neglectful but he's expected to care for her emotionally). My 2nd fear on the late thing is she'll come in during the ceremony while the bridesmaids or worse, I the bride am walking down the isle and just be like ""excuse me, just getting a seat!"" Because she's done things like that before. 

The fear I gave with my fiance's grandfather is that she'll make him help with bathroom breaks, cutting his food, changing him, and getting him in and out of the car. He has plenty of family in their 30's that can help but his mother often puts the burden of constant care in his hands.

My ex-girlfriend, let’s call her Sarah, broke up with me about two years ago. We were together for almost three years, and I thought we were solid. I wasn’t rich, but I had a decent job, treated her well, and we had a good life together—or so I thought.

Then, out of nowhere, she hits me with the “I love you, but I need to think about my future” speech. A month later, I see her on Instagram living it up in luxury—fancy vacations, expensive dinners, designer bags—the works. Turns out, she had left me for some finance bro who was making six figures and showering her with gifts.

It hurt, not gonna lie. But I moved on. I focused on myself, got a promotion, and even started seeing someone new. Life was good.

Fast forward to last week, and guess who slides into my DMs? Yep, Sarah. She starts with some small talk, then gets into the whole “I’ve been thinking about you a lot” and “I miss what we had” speech. I was confused until I did some light social media stalking. Turns out, rich finance bro wasn’t as perfect as she thought—he cheated on her with multiple women, got caught in some shady business deals, and lost a ton of money. Now, instead of private jets, she’s posting about “humble new beginnings” and “real love over material things.”

She straight-up asked if we could meet for coffee. I haven’t responded yet, but I can’t help but laugh at the irony. She left me for money, got played, and now that she’s struggling, she wants to rekindle what we had? Nah, I’m good.

What do you guys think? Should I hear her out just for the drama, or leave her in the past where she belongs?",1,1741495088.0,story,1,1.0,False

For the majority of my life, I never really considered I ADHD until recently where I started looking at this subreddit and people talked about things they did. For example, every morning when I pour water to brew coffee I spill the water everywhere and often do the same when i’m pouring coffee. I often get very lazy at the end of projects or assignments and always pace around before I began anything including things like video games. I am bored of everything and spend all day watching youtube and insteagram reels, I also always feel like i’m doing things slower than others and feel like i’m not putting enough effort but no matter how much i try i’m never trying my best. I also rely on coffee to feel energized and get very tired talking to people. Are any of these concerns worth going for evaluation when i’m 18? There’s more concerns if anyone wants to hear me rant. Also, I don’t have any physical evidence or input from parents, is it still worth it ",1,1741495077.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

Hi all,

Looking for a bit of advice and seeing if anyone else has this specific issue.
I have a breville barista express impress and my issue is that during any one espresso making session where I would pull six or seven shots back to back at around the third or forth shot they start pulling a lot faster like 3-5 seconds faster. It’s not a gradual thing as in a second faster each shot it’s night and day. I.e. third shot would be 36g at 30 seconds forth shot will be 36g at 26 seconds.

It doesn’t continue to get faster the more I make after that first decrease in shot time either which initially made me think I wasn’t warming up the machine enough so I am extra thorough in the warm up so I don’t believe it’s that. I have good scales and weigh the amount of ground coffee prior to pulling the shot, use a WDT tool and manually tamp not using the inbuilt tamp and obviously am not changing grind size at all. 

Are there any variables I’m not thinking of that could be the cause? Or is it just the machines lack of precision when it comes to grind, temp fluctuation, pressure. 

Apart from this I’m very happy with my machine and am still only new to the world of espresso making so looking forward to learning more and forever chasing that perfect shot.

Thank you,",1,1741494776.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Harry was the best—popular, smart, talented. He was everything I wished I could be. We had a great relationship, always together, like two peas in a pod.

When we were sixteen, I had a crush on a girl in my class named Isabel. She was the sweetest. But I had no confidence at that age. I told Harry everything, and he vowed to help me secure a date with her. He told me I needed to make the first move—to start small, make casual conversation in class, and eventually ask for her number.

I listened to him.

It worked perfectly. After a couple of weeks, Isabel and I had a date set up for coffee in the morning. But that day, she confessed something to me—she had a crush on my brother.

I went home devastated and miserable.

Eventually, I told Harry. He apologized, but it didn’t change how I felt. A few weeks later, he came home late one weekend, practically buzzing with excitement. He told me he had gone on a date with Isabel, and it had been the most perfect night of his life. He shared all the details, oblivious to the storm brewing inside me. I forced a smile and told him I was happy for him. But deep down, I resented him for it. He knew how I felt about her, and yet, he still went after her.

The next morning, we had plans to go swimming in a local river. When we arrived, I noticed the currents were unusually strong. I told Harry it wasn’t safe, but, overconfident as always, he just laughed. He stripped down to his swim trunks and waded in.

It all happened so fast.

The current pulled him under. He flailed wildly, his arms thrashing in the air. He was drowning. I could have called for help. I could have jumped in after him. But I didn’t.

Instead, I took my wallet and tossed it into the water. Then, I picked up his wallet.

When I got home, I told my parents that I had lost Bryan in the woods. The search went on for weeks. His face was all over the local news. But they never found Harry.

That was ten years ago.

Now, I’m happily married to Isabel. And I have no regrets.

He should have never come between me and her.

So sophisticated, please help understand…","Just got back from Big Island Hawaii and went down the rabbit hole that is coffee. I found that the “Hawaiian cupping comp.” Seemed to score beans/coffee direct from farm instead of roasters yet coffee review went by roasters….. I wound up getting Geisha, sl34, and red bourbon from 3 top farms who sold their own beans roasted instead of roasters that buy green bean than roast …. When roasted by a “popular/top notch” roaster the price went up significantly… is the lower price point freshly roasted from farm better than same bean/farm from some fancy roaster? Or does it run the gamut depending on price, farm, roaster?",1,1741493983.0,CoffeeRoasting,2,1.0,False
1j6zh2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Friends/comments/1j6zh2k/34f4a_the_introverts_club/,34[F4A] the introverts club,"have you heard about the silent book club thing? The same concept: A get together for introverts to do our own things or try new things together. 

While I like my daily life, sometimes I think to read ebooks/ manga or watch anime or tv series somewhere else. Or wanna visit places or try activities.  But as an introvert, nakakailang tumambay somewhere alone and nakakakaba mag travel on my own. And I only have 3  friends who are also busy with life. 

This is for introverts:
1. na bet ng change of scenery once in a while. 
2. na may peace of mind. The idea is to provide a safe place for introverts, so  di pwede sa maraming drama sa life. I do not have the energy for negativity. 
3. With source of income, for food, transpo, and cost of the activity. KKB or sharing, no freeloaders. 
4. single, or if in a relationship or married, dapat kasama si partner, to avoid conflict. 
5. know to respect boundaries. 

what do we do: 

1. we can meet up halfway, any recommended place,  and we do our own thing - reading, gaming, or anything, silently. 
2. we allot time for small chika, or not, then do our own thing again
3. we can do board games, card games, or mall activities, basta scheduled and planned properly. 


This is strictly SFW. an introvert knows a fellow introvert. so if you are planning to join and hahanap lang ng kasomething, I ,,or we, would know immediately. 


Yan ang general idea. Open for suggestions. 
Message me your ideas, one day we can meet over coffee and discuss the setup thoroughly.

I tasted it and it tasted fine to me just like water which leads me to believe it was just water condensation but my mom also tasted it and said it tastes sweet so I am now concerned that coolant could be in my exhaust somehow. I checked around my engine and didn’t see any leaking coolant lines or anything near my exhaust that could leak into it and I also checked my oil and it looked normal color, not like milked coffee thankfully. I’m wondering if this is something I need to be worried about or if there’s somewhere I need to check for coolant leaks or if I am probably fine",1,1741493729.0,AskMechanics,4,1.0,False
