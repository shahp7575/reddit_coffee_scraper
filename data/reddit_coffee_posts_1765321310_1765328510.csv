1piotv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pirates/comments/1piotv6/are_you_seeking_truth_of_life/,are you seeking truth of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1piosux,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1piosux/is_this_workplace_harassment_or_am_i_crazy_i_need/,"Is this workplace harassment? Or am I crazy? I need help, please.","
So I work with an older lady who is probably around my mom’s age. This woman, started off really quirky and odd but I didn’t think of her as rude or anything; I thought she was a good person/nice. However, I think I might’ve misjudged… or am I crazy? I’m sorry, I’m seeking validation here. Especially because I’ve started feeling harassed. Getting into it…

This woman has caused multiple inappropriate or made it a hostile workplace incidents and I’m going to list them not in order because I am doing my best, seeing as I left my work today in tears. I ended up working from another building about a street or so over. I am probably going to work there for another week at that location. So there is that.

Where we work it’s loud, we work in a front desk role and hundreds of people come in and out and it gets loud. The previous people in my position didn’t seem to have any issues with it, but this woman does. She will yell at people and tell them to shut up or for more context; a supervisor over a team was talking to a few members, while she was on the phone, they were a little loud and instead of just asking them to be quiet she screamed at them, saying “SHUT THE F—- UP.” While she was on the phone with another supervisor. 

Another time, an employee came up and tried to make a joke with her. “You ain’t never drink all your coffee.” Or something along those lines is what he said and she snapped saying, “that is none of your business” and she just got a real sour look on her face. That guy told her to leave him alone because he doesn’t want to deal with her anymore. 

Another guy we work with she was really rude to. She also had an inappropriate relationship with him. He had also helped her move, twice, and the second time he asked her to sign a contract and pay him for him helping her. She told me, “If you’re expecting payment then he shouldn’t expect anything from me if you know what I mean.” This guy walks by and says goodbye to me, and he wouldn’t speak to her for a while. He eventually does start to speak to her, but she’s rude and nasty at first and says back-handed comments when he’s leaving like, “I don’t care about him.” And again, makes a sour face.

She says that a lot, “I don’t care” which I’m thinking is an implication that she actually does care and is just bitter? 

Another time I threw away my chipotle and I was so confused but it was my money?? She tried to lecture me like she was my mom. She told me, “don’t get so much food”  In turn I said, “but it’s chipotle and they give you a lot of food and I don’t like leftovers reheated twice” And she proceeded to tell me, “well don’t get chipotle then.” Like what even, who are you? Who do you think you are? Then I told her, “well it’s my money… so.” And which she had another smart-back handed comment to say in return. It’s like she always has to be right.

For example, she said I sent her a SNL skit. I have never seen an episode of SNL or any skits of it until she showed me one of this woman acting really weird on stage. We had went back and forth. She kept telling me, “No you sent it.” And I kept telling her that I did not send her a link to the video because I had absolutely no idea what the hell she was talking about. I was so confused. I let her have the last word because it wasn’t worth it at the time but like I had pulled up all my messages with her (I had maybe 3-5 in total including the ones I had sent and received from her). I had the receipts but like allowed her to be right because it shut her up.

She had also got mad because my supervisor would communicate with me and not her, and that never made sense to me; he is my supervisor and not hers? She always got really bitter when he would walk by. She would make that sour face again. I had later found out he wanted as little communication with her as possible because she would flip the lid. Before I had started there, she would be doing my job that I have now. One of the supervisors over the teams gave her a stack of paperwork and allegedly she yelled at him and refused to do it. 

Which I wholeheartedly agree that that is most likely accurate because she does refuse to do her job. I have listened to her, she complains about being asked to be pulled to do a job that is a requirement. She says things when we get emails about it just out loud, thinking to herself, “I’m not doing that.” Etc. then it’s funny because we sit up just twiddling our thumbs and playing on our phones and talking and she complains about not having enough work. However, I have went and sought out more work for me to do. She is pissed because she’s not getting more work. Which confuses me, because she complains about doing her job but also complains about not getting enough? Then she makes bitter sounding comments like, “That’s fine they can pay me to sit up here and do nothing.” Like what, you should never aspire to be like that.

By the way, talking with this woman — I feel like I know her whole life story after a few months. Her mother is a narcissist and she’s had to deal with it. That’s all I’m going to divulge for her private life.

She has also jokingly tried to do a high kick in someone’s face, and almost kicked them. In the middle of an office. Like what??? Who does that? 

One of the supervisors of the team, I work with closely because it’s part of my role. He came up and asked for help with his computer, and which I was able to help. He made a comment and said he’s going to come to me for all his computer questions, cool that’s fine. She did not like him saying that, she got offended and said, “well you can ask me too” then he said, “Yeah but you work under another supervisor and we work under so and so.” And she said “well we all should work together there shouldn’t be a divide like that” like she just got so mad and passionate about it. He had just ended up walking away and now this supervisor is scared to ask me stuff in front of her because of how she acts. He has said “I would ask you more but then she has to always say something.”

I have had conversations with team members and she has to interject herself into them and ask about things she overhears. I’ve had people I talk to downright ignore her. These people used to also come up and talk to the old front desk employees but when she started she made people feel uncomfortable. For example, she’s talked about her not having a gag reflex to other employees (I have literally overheard this, she was talking to a guy we work with). Then she also told someone, “I wonder what makes these guys dicks hard.” I heard that through the grapevine but I wholeheartedly agree she said that as well because she’s just that inappropriate. She demeans all the males we work with, and she’ll look at them and make comments to me (I am an engaged woman set to be married in December). She’ll ask me if I think someone is attractive and it was making me really uncomfortable. I don’t look at my coworkers like that. I am there to work. I have only ever commented that someone had pretty eyes. It just feels very demeaning the way she looks at the male employees we work with. It also feels like she doesn’t respect my relationship at all with my fiancée when she says things like that to me. 

One of the team supervisors came up all heated because of something and I can’t remember what he said. He wasn’t rude just sounded very distressed in my opinion. But she had yelled at him to take his shit elsewhere as he walked away. 

She also had this bad behavior of telling me what she’s doing to be petty or be a vindictive person. She said that she was still getting emails from her old department and she’s saving them all up so she can send them to them at the end of the year. What sane person does that? Just keep asking for them to remove you until they’re tired of you.

She had also told me she used to work at a front desk in her last department at one point and she noticed how many times this one person got up and used the bathroom and made a comment about it. Like who do you think you are? That girl could’ve had a medical condition, could’ve been medication, you don’t know but it’s none of your business. 

She was then talked to about her behavior a little bit. She calmed down with the screaming and cussing. (She had since said the thing to a coworker about having a gag reflex, and also continues to talk to me and point out guys and asks if I think they’re attractive. — sorry just putting them in, not in any particular order.) 

However she will still say, “If someone has a problem with something you say that’s their problem.” I absolutely hate this phrase and have never heard it before I met this woman but she says it a lot. This phrase sounds like someone who does not want to hold themselves ever accountable for things they say or do. Like sometimes people say the wrong things, or what you say affects people and that’s not always their problem because we are human and prone to human error. Your actions and words do affect people and if there is a problem with something you said or did you should be held accountable. Or am I wrong?

She has a strong disdain for the phrase, “It is what it is.” She says she thinks it’s a toxic phrase because you could change whatever it is. However I don’t feel like that is entirely true, sometimes things are entirely out of your control. 

More recently she has basically been following me around. She is not above me by any means. I do not report to her. On Monday she stood over my computer saw something and sent an email to literally everyone about it. (It wasn’t anything inappropriate but it wasn’t her business.) She was so mad and kept calling me out in phone calls in front of me. On this same day, I had gotten up and said, “I’m gonna go wash my hands before I eat.” Went and washed my hands, well in the bathroom I ran into another supervisor over the team she had come out of the stall. This supervisor was out half of last week. So I was filling her in because I had done my best and helped out with her paperwork. I was gone a while. But we were talking about work and everything. When I walked out of the bathroom, this woman up front I work with had come to find me. She made the excuse, “Oh, I just wanted to check on you make sure you’re okay.” Like umm. Me and the supervisor just looked at each other. I felt extremely uncomfortable, but let it pass. The same supervisor had left, saying she was going to go make her donuts. (This means she’s going to go out and make her rounds and check on her team). The front desk woman said, “She needs to stop saying that, that’s probably derogatory.” Like what? I told her I don’t think it was but she always has to be right. 

The following day on Tuesday, things went normal but I had started to get quiet. Late on Tuesday I was sent an HR meeting request because of what this woman had saw on my computer. I was going to meet with them on Wednesday. So I decided y’know I’m going to ice this woman out because I am just done. I say good morning on Wednesday, start doing my work, then she starts trying to talk to me. I tell her I’m going to focus on my work. So I start doing that. I had let my direct supervisor know I’m going to be gone for a meeting at 8:30 at another building and I talk to the manager of the building as well. I told him I feel like she’s attacking me now and I need to defend myself. So I go over to the meeting, I decide that I want to file a formal HR complaint. They send me what I need and I thank them and go about my day. I go back to work at my normal location. I end up having a meeting with the manager of the building. I was gone for a while. We got off topic, the supervisor who I talked to in the bathroom came in to talk for a minute, she was going to corroborate my story and make a statement as well. Everything was good. This front desk woman calls looking for me. I was in a meeting with the manager of the building. The only people who need to know where I’m at, what I’m doing is my direct supervisor and the manager. I don’t know why she called looking for me. I started feeling like she’s stalking me. Harassing me. Like this was a hostile work environment. So I go about my day after that. I end up getting all my tasks done and towards the end of the day, I start talking to my old supervisors wife — she works in the building. (My supervisor had gotten transferred.) this woman told me the story of this front desk woman on why she barely comes up to talk; because she makes her feel uncomfortable. Front desk woman told ex supervisors wife, that she wants to know what makes these guys dicks hard. Like what the absolute hell. So I go into it, I guess she can tell I’m stressed. We sit in the conference room for a moment. Until 2pm hits. The front desk woman comes looking for me again, to say bye. Like what. If I am not up there, you do not need to come find me. I am not a person you need to keep tabs on. I want to say these things but I am scared of her because she is unhinged and she screams and yells and gets a bad attitude. I have anxiety and I don’t want to deal with her. 

The following day, I go in and I barely talk to her. I say good morning and I say hello to everyone else and talk to other people. I get up and come and go as I please. Not saying a single word. She keeps asking me if I’m okay, trying to make small talk. 

Now I see her “friendliness” as a façade. Her inside is truly ugly. So I don’t want to talk to her. So I don’t talk. At the end of the day, I tell her to have a good day and go home. 

On Friday, this was just the tip of the iceberg. I was in a meeting with some of the employees and the managers — I was taking notes. I got a call from HR, when I get out of the meeting, I go back to my desk and plan to call HR back. This front desk woman yelled, partially because it was loud, “Were you in a meeting?” She said it 3 x, both times I tried to ignore her. I ended up just saying, “Yeah” or nodding my head — I don’t know it was a blur. I go outside, call HR back and find a private office to do this call. I find out that some things can’t be tried again because of double jeopardy. That makes sense. That’s fine. However, they also told me that her following me to the bathroom, etc. might just be thrown out if there was an investigation. She could just say she was there because it was a free country and she was walking by there. I was like but I have witnesses. She had stopped and talked to us, said she was looking for me? She had called the superintendent looking for me? I was just so confused. I broke down in tears and said I still would want to continue the investigation. I left the HR call with that. Left the room to get my ducks in a row, was going to ask my ex-supervisor’s wife if she would corroborate my story before I move forward with the complaint. I just felt alone, overwhelmed and like people keep saying they’re on my side they have my back but no one can protect me from this woman it feels like. So I just went into tears. Front desk lady’s direct supervisor saw me and said let’s talk to the manager and I got the approval to go home except I don’t want to go home because of that woman. I was told to go to HR, so I left and went to HR. I talked to them in person so now I’m working there for the next week temporarily. Before you all say, why isn’t this woman fired? Because we have a union and the union protects her.

A few weeks ago, maybe a month or so. We had a safety employee come up, and he said this guy’s job title was something silly and so I brought up how we had a customer at my last company that had a job position titled banana manager and we both thought that was funny, because it was silly. This woman then proceeded to try to accuse me, say that I said that to be inappropriate which I didn’t and I told her “No I didn’t.” And she went and told me that, “You were thinking that.” In a laughing voice at me. I went and said, “No I wasn’t.” Clearly I was annoyed. She then proceeded to continue to accuse me. I ended up getting up and told her to leave me alone. I went over talked to the safety people, concerned that they also thought I said that with the intention to be inappropriate— that’s not like me by any means. They didn’t. I ended up going to calm down for a few, upset because I have PTSD and being falsely accused really triggered me honestly. I went back to my desk and she started trying to apologize to me and I just told her I was done with her and done with her bs — verbatim. I immediately apologized because no I shouldn’t have said that, but also this woman has just done so much to me. I think I was overwhelmed. We ended being told from the boss to leave each other alone, unless it’s work related, which is fine. Being work related means that it has to be like “hey this is your paperwork it was mixed in with mine”.

So it’s been a few weeks, things have been good outside of her slight hostility energy. Her listening in to my private conversation with my supervisor about me being off for the week of my honeymoon and then somehow twisting it that I was leaving in December. I however called off sick yesterday due to me having a stomach bug and she had sent an email bringing my name into a conversation like I didn’t do something correctly when it was for her section and not mine. And then 2, I came in to little notes she had left on my desk of her organizing my paperwork. Like I told you to leave me alone. Like please do not touch anything on my desk.

Then you’d know that feeling, that ache that isn’t pain, but still finds its way into your ribs. That steady hum in your chest that tells you you’re exactly where you’re supposed to be.

I asked Elenor to marry me on a rainy Sunday morning in the kitchen of our apartment. The smell of coffee lingered in the air, mixed with the sound of Billie Holiday playing through a cheap Bluetooth speaker and the soft hiss of rain against the window.

She had just spilled egg yolk on her baggy pajama shirt and was half-singing, half-talking to herself as she wiped it with a wet cloth.

“Oh Elenor’s a dumbass who spills shit all the time, If anybody loved her, it’d surely be a crime.”

“Arrest me then,” I said, cutting her off as I knelt behind her, the ring catching a glint of pale morning light.

“Wow, you are so cor—” she started, but her voice caught halfway. Her hands flew to her mouth. The cloth hit the floor with a quiet smack.

“El,” I said softly. “I’ve loved you from the moment I met you.”

“Oh my god, stop,” she said through her hands, eyes already glassy.

“These four years with you… they’ve meant everything to me. I don’t need anything bigger than this, just more of it. More of you.”

I smiled, awkwardly, trying to keep my voice from breaking. “Will you marry me?”

“Yes, of course you idiot.”

I stood, swept her up, kissed her. She was laughing and crying, and I could taste salt and coffee and morning on her lips. When I slipped the ring on her finger, she looked at it like it was a small miracle.

“You could’ve at least waited until I cleaned my shirt,” she said, smiling through tears.

“Well, take it off then,” I said, grinning.

She gasped and tried to wriggle away as I scooped her up and carried her toward the bedroom. She was laughing the whole way, that unguarded, open laugh that made me fall in love with her in the first place.

That Sunday morning was the happiest I’ve ever been.

\*\*\*

Later, lying together in the pale after-light, Elenor rested her hand against my chest, tracing the lines of my collarbone with her finger.

“I have to tell everyone,” she said suddenly, sitting up and grabbing her phone from the nightstand.

She dialed her mom first, sitting on the edge of the bed as she talked. I just watched her, the way her hair caught the light, the way her voice broke between laughter and tears.

I reached over and dragged my fingers down her back in little circles. I could feel her heartbeat through the thin cotton of her shirt.

“Who the hell should I call?” I thought to myself as El giggled in the background.

At that time, I’d lived in the city for just over five years. I moved from my small town for a job fresh out of college. You’d think five years is long enough to make some friends, but the city had proved to be nothing but isolating. The only person I really talked to was my cubicle neighbor, Brian.

That was, of course, before I met Elenor.

We met at a bar I didn’t even want to be at. My coworkers had dragged me there for “team bonding” — a bunch of guys in ill-fitting polos drinking cheap beer and complaining about their “bitch wives.”

I was nursing a Jack and Coke that had long since gone flat when she walked in: the girl in the yellow sundress with chipped nail polish and a messy bun that somehow looked intentional.

She looked like the kind of person who could make a stranger feel at home, and I think that’s exactly what she did to me.

I remember Brian catching me staring. He nudged me, reeking of whiskey, and said, “Go talk to her, man.”

“Nah,” I muttered. “What would I even say?”

“You tell her your name, give her the eyes, conversation’ll make itself. Trust me.”

Before I could argue, he grabbed my wallet and chucked it toward the bar—it landed right at her feet.

“Go fetch, buddy,” he said, grinning like a fool.

I should’ve been furious, but instead I just… went.

“Hey, sorry… my friend’s an idiot,” I said, crouching to pick it up.

She smirked. “I can see that.”

“I swear I don’t usually make my entrances like this.”

“Shame,” she said, tilting her head. “It’s a bold move.”

I smiled. “Worked though, didn’t it?”

She smiled back, eyes glinting. “Guess it did.”

“So,” I said, still half-smiling, “what’s your name?”

“Elenor.”

By the end of the night we were the last two people in the bar, talking about everything from favourite movies to our deepest fears.

After that, I started to actually have a social life. Her friends became my friends, her world absorbed mine. But when I tried to think of someone who was mine to call with the good news, no one came to mind.

I scrolled through my contacts and landed on one name I hadn’t seen in years.

Nick. My brother.

I stared at it for a while, thumb hovering. Then I hit “call.”

The call rang four times before he picked up.

“Holy shit,” Nick said, his voice crackling through the speaker. “No way. The city boy lives.”

I smiled. “Hey, man.”

“Five years, huh? I thought you got abducted or something.”

“Something like that,” I said. “Work’s been... busy.”

“Bullshit. You just hate small talk.”

He wasn’t wrong. I smiled despite myself. “Fair point.”

There was a pause—the kind that sits between two people who used to talk without thinking and now have to remember how.

“So what’s up, Al?” he asked finally. “Not that I’m not honored by your once-a-decade phone call.”

“I’m engaged,” I said, before I could chicken out.

The silence lasted just long enough for me to think the call dropped. Then:

“No shit.”

“Yeah. Her name’s Elenor.”

“Elenor,” he repeated, drawing out the vowels. “Damn, Al. You actually did it. You found someone who can put up with you.”

“Barely,” I said. “She still thinks I’m funny, though. I’m not gonna question it.”

He laughed, that deep, full laugh that sounded exactly the same as when we were kids.

“Damn. Mom would’ve lost her mind.”

I hesitated before answering. “Yeah. Probably.”

He didn’t push it. We hadn’t talked about our parents in years, and the silence between that topic was a kind of unspoken agreement.

“So what’s she like?” he asked, shifting the weight of the conversation.

I leaned back on the couch, looking over at El in the kitchen. She was still on her phone, laughing.

“She’s... the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Smart, funny, way too good for me.”

“Good,” he said simply, and I could hear the warmth in it. “You deserve that.”

I leaned back into the couch. For a moment I just listened to his breathing on the other end of the line. It was strange how quickly things between us started to feel easy again, like muscle memory you didn’t know you still had.

“What about you?” I asked. “What’ve you been up to?”

He let out a short laugh. “Ah, you know. Working construction mostly. Still in town. Still driving Dad’s old truck.”

“Does it still run?”

“Barely,” he said. “But it’s got character. So do I.”

I smiled. “Same old Nick.”

“Pretty much,” he said. “Although, there’s this girl. Hailey.”

“Hailey?” I repeated, sitting up a little. “Like, Hailey from high school? Blonde hair, loud laugh, used to date Jared Fennick?”

“The one and only.”

“No way,” I said, grinning. “You’re dating Hailey Garrison?”

“Yeah. Wild, right? Ran into her at the grocery store a couple months back. One thing led to another, now she’s got me eating salads and doing yoga.”

“Oh no,” I said. “She’s turned you into a citizen.”

“Shut up,” he laughed. “She’s good for me. We’re still figuring stuff out, but she’s... solid. Different.”

“That’s awesome, man,” I said. “Seriously.”

“Yeah, well, she’s got all these ideas about, like, bettering ourselves. We’re actually supposed to go to some couples retreat thing next weekend.” He paused, clearly amused with himself. “She got this pamphlet from some Amish-looking lady outside a farmer’s market. Says it’s this digital detox, back-to-basics kind of place.”

“That sounds... sketchy,” I said, laughing. “You sure she didn’t recruit you into a cult?”

“Hey, I thought the same thing,” he said. “But Hailey’s all in. Thinks it’ll be good for us. Get away from the world for a few days, clear our heads. Something about ‘reconnecting with traditional values.’ Whatever that means.”

“Wow,” I said. “That’s a sentence I never thought I’d hear from you.”

“Right? But apparently there’s hiking, home-cooked meals, farm animals... She keeps calling it Stillwater Farms.”

“Stillwater Farms,” I repeated. “That sounds like either a retirement community or a brand of bottled water.”

Nick laughed. “Yeah, I know. I told her it sounds like a horror movie. She didn’t find that as funny as I did.”

“She wouldn’t,” I said, smiling. “Hailey always took things too seriously.”

“Yeah, well,” he said, “she’s excited. And honestly, it might be good for us. Things have been... a little rocky lately.”

I heard the honesty there, tucked between the humor. He tried to gloss over it. “Anyway, I was thinking, you and your lady should come. Make it a double thing. She gets her couples therapy, I get to hang with my brother again. Win-win.”

I laughed. “You’re inviting me to a couples retreat that you know practically nothing about?”

“Exactly,” he said. “If it’s a disaster, at least I’ll have backup.”

“I don’t know, man. A weekend in the middle of nowhere with you and Hailey? Sounds like a trap.”

“You’re scared I’ll outshine you.”

“Yeah,” I said. “That’s definitely it.”

He chuckled. “Come on, Al. I’d love to meet Elenor. It’s been forever. We’ll grab a couple cabins, get drunk on organic wine or goat’s milk or whatever they’re serving.”

I hesitated, glancing toward the kitchen where Elenor’s soft voice still murmured over the phone. “Yeah,” I said finally. “That actually sounds... nice.”

“You serious?” he said. “Hell yeah! I’ll tell Hailey she gets her couples retreat after all. I’ll text you the details.”

“Alright,” I said, smiling. “It’ll be good to see you, Nick.”

“You too, Al.” His tone softened, just for a second. “Feels good hearing your voice again.”

“Yeah,” I said quietly. “You too, man.”

When the call ended, I sat there for a while, listening to the rain fade against the window.

Elenor walked back into the room, phone in hand, glowing from the conversation. “Who was that?”

“My brother,” I said. “He wants us to go away with him and his girlfriend next weekend. Some couples retreat thing.”

“Really?” she said. “What kind of retreat?”

“Stillwater Farms,” I said. “Apparently it’s all about... reconnecting.”

She smiled. “That doesn’t sound so bad.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Guess not.”

But as I looked back at my phone with the buzz of a text from Nick, the words *Stillwater Farms* sat there on the screen like they were waiting for something.

***— Day 1 —***

We left the city on a Friday morning that couldn’t make up its mind about the weather. The kind of gray that felt temporary, like the sky was holding its breath.

Elenor packed snacks, playlists, and enough optimism to power the car. I packed one duffel bag and a quiet knot in my stomach I couldn’t quite name.

Nick had texted me the directions the night before; not an address, just a pin dropped in the middle of nowhere, with a message that said:

*Follow the road till it ends. They said they’ll meet us there.*

Elenor glanced at it while I was driving. “That’s not... weird at all.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Apparently we’re being met by our spirit guide or something.”

She laughed, kicking her bare feet up on the dash. The smell of coconut lotion filled the car.

“You think your brother’s nervous?”

“About what?”

“Meeting me. You said you guys haven’t seen each other in forever.”

I thought about that for a second. “He’ll probably pretend he’s not. That’s kind of his thing.”

Somewhere around noon, the city noise had completely dropped out. No hum of traffic, no skyline. Just trees, thick and patient, standing in rows that got taller and older the farther we went.

By the time we reached the end of the pavement, it had turned to gravel, and the air had changed, thicker somehow, smelling faintly of wet hay and cedar.

Nick’s truck was waiting just ahead, parked crooked at the edge of the road. He leaned against the hood, arms crossed, that same cocky smirk plastered across his face.

Elenor nudged me. “He looks exactly how I pictured him.”

“How’s that?”

“Like trouble that never fully grew up.”

She wasn’t wrong.

Hailey was there too, perched on the passenger side, arms crossed, blonde hair tied back. She looked just as she had in high school.

When Nick saw us pull up, he straightened and spread his arms like we’d just driven into a reunion movie.

“Look at this city slicker!”

I stepped out. For a second we just stared at each other; both of us realizing how long five years actually was. Then he closed the distance and pulled me into a hug.

It wasn’t one of those polite hugs people give out of obligation. It was solid, unspoken, real. I hadn’t realized how much I’d missed him, how much I’d loved him, until that moment.

When he finally let go, he looked me over and grinned. “You’ve gotten soft.”

“And you’ve gotten older.”

He grinned. “You’re damn right.”

Elenor came around the car, and I saw Nick’s posture shift immediately. He smiled wider—proud.

“You must be the one who said yes to this idiot.”

“That’s me,” she said, shaking his hand. “You must be the brother who threw him into walls as a kid.”

Nick laughed. “You’ve done your homework.”

Hailey joined us, smiling like someone trying to prove a point. “Alex,” she said.

It was the first time I’d heard her say my name since high school.

“Long time.”

“Yeah,” I said. “You look the same.”

She rolled her eyes. “I’ll take it.”

Nick clapped his hands together. “Alright, lovebirds. Ready for the middle of nowhere?”

“Lead the way,” I said.

We followed Nick’s truck down a dirt road, dust curling in the air like pale smoke. The road narrowed into a single lane bordered by tall oaks and maples, their branches stitching together above us until the sunlight broke into trembling gold patches across the hood.

Elenor rolled down her window and leaned her arm out. “Smells different out here,” she said.

“Like dirt?”

“Like earth,” she corrected, smiling. “Real earth. Not the kind that comes in a bag.”

Ten minutes later, the GPS lost signal completely. The map froze mid-scroll, our blue dot hovering over a blank patch of green.

Then, without warning, the road ended. It didn’t curve or split, it just stopped.

Nick’s truck slowed to a crawl, brake lights glowing through the settling dust. He stepped out, squinting at the treeline like he was trying to find something.

That’s when I saw her.

A woman stood at the edge of the trees, half-lit by the sun breaking through the clouds. Early fifties, maybe. Gray hair tied in a neat braid, a simple linen dress the color of wet clay. Her face was lined but gentle—the kind of face you’d trust without thinking about it.

She looked like she’d been waiting.

Nick waved like this was perfectly normal. “You must be Mae!”

Her smile warmed easily, revealing faint dimples. “You must be Nicholas,” she said, her voice smooth and steady, touched with a southern accent that made you feel at home. “We were starting to think the road swallowed you up.”

Nick laughed. “Wouldn’t be the first time. This my brother, Alex, and his fiancée, Elenor. And you’ve met Hailey before.”

Mae turned to us, her eyes kind. “Welcome. You made good time.”

Elenor smiled, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “We weren’t sure we were in the right place. The road just kind of... ends.”

Mae chuckled softly. “The maps don’t quite know what to do with us. The farm’s further in, and the roads don’t show up online. We use this spot as a meeting place, easier for newcomers.”

She gestured to the old pickup idling nearby. A man sat in the driver’s seat, tall and broad-shouldered, a sun-faded hat shading his face. He gave a polite nod but didn’t get out.

“That there is Harlan,” Mae said. “He’ll take the lead. It’s not far.”

There was something so effortlessly sure about her: a composure that made you feel foolish for being uncertain. She didn’t have the hollow cheer of a tour guide or the stiffness of someone running a business. She just seemed… steady.

Elenor leaned closer to me. “She’s sweet,” she whispered.

“Yeah,” I said, my voice lower than I meant it to be.

Mae smiled again, meeting my eyes like she’d heard me anyway.

“Shall we?”

Nick clapped me on the back. “Adventure time, little brother.”

I forced a grin. “Yeah. Let’s do it.”

El and I climbed into the bed of Nick’s truck; there was no way my Civic would’ve made it down the muddy trail ahead.

The smell of wet soil and exhaust filled the air. Light filtered through branches in long, molten beams that never seemed to move, frozen midair like dust caught in amber.

Elenor rested her head against my shoulder, swaying gently as the truck rolled through the mud.

As the trees closed in, I glanced back at my car parked at the edge of the lane. The windshield caught the sunlight, flashing once before the trees swallowed it completely.

The trees thinned, and then, suddenly, the land opened up.

\*\*\*

Stillwater Farms spread out before us, quiet and sun-soaked. The white farmhouse sat in the center like it had always been there, its paint softened by decades of rain. A rust-red barn leaned nearby, half swallowed in shadow. Wooden fences traced the hills in looping, uneven lines.

When Nick cut the truck’s engine, the stillness rose to meet us—not silence exactly, but a hush filled with the small, living sounds of the place: insects clicking in the grass, a pulley creaking on a line, the faint bleat of a goat far off.

Harlan climbed out of their truck first. Up close, he looked even bigger, shoulders squared, face unreadable beneath the brim of his faded baseball hat. He gave Mae a short nod, then turned toward the barn. The weight of him seemed to pull the air along as he walked away.

On the porch, a man sat with his hat in his lap, eyes on us the whole time. He didn’t move until we were close enough to hear the porch boards breathe under our feet. Then he stood, and the simple act of it made the air feel more serious.

“You must be the travelers Mae told me about,” he said. His voice was low and even—the kind that didn’t need to be loud to be heard. “The road’s a teacher, isn’t it? Always finds a way to humble you.”

“This is Abel,” Mae said, touching his arm with a familiarity that read like gravity. “My husband.”

Abel’s gaze moved over us in no rush: Nick first, then Hailey, then me, then El. Not weighing, not judging. Seeing.

“You’re welcome here,” he said. “All who come in good faith are.”

Hailey beamed. “It’s so beautiful. This is exactly what I pictured.”

“Pictures are flatter than places,” Abel said, one corner of his mouth tipping. “Places insist.”

Mae’s smile widened at that, as if he’d said a private joke out loud. “Before supper, a little orientation,” she said. “Then a short walk, if you’ve got the legs for it.”

We followed her inside for the “little orientation.” The entry smelled like cedar, heat, and something baking. Along the far wall stood a small table: plain wood, and a wicker basket in the center.

“We keep Stillwater simple,” Mae said. “This is a retreat from noise—so we leave the noise behind.”

She tapped the basket lightly. “Phones, watches, anything electric. They’ll be safe here until you head home.”

Nick shot me a look like *be cool*. He dropped his phone in first. Hailey followed. El squeezed my hand and set hers down gently. Mine went in last.

Mae lifted the basket. “Safe as houses,” she said, and disappeared through a side door. When she returned, the basket was empty. “Now. Water.”

The way she said it made me pay attention.

Abel nodded toward the kitchen window. “We keep a separate tank out back for guests,” he said. “Good, clean rainwater. If you need a drink, a wash, anything, use that. The well is for the house.”

Hailey tilted her head. “Is the well contaminated?”

“The well’s old,” Abel said. “Minerals in it can make newcomers mighty sick. Your bodies aren’t used to it.” His tone was ordinary, practical, almost apologetic. “Use the tank and you’ll be right as rain.”

I glanced past him. Through the window, I could see a tall, black-rimmed tank set off from the house, a spigot glinting in the light.

“Shall we stretch our legs?” Mae asked.

\*\*\*

We stepped back out into the late afternoon that felt like it had stalled five minutes before sunset. Abel walked beside us, hat in hand; Mae set the pace without seeming to.

We crossed the yard to a kitchen garden laid out in neat squares: herbs, lettuces, rows of tomatoes strung on twine. A woman straightened up from the dirt as we approached, wiping her hands on a flour-sack towel. Thirty-five by the look of her, hair tied back, sleeves rolled to the elbow. Her forearms were strong in a way you only get from work.

“This is Ruth,” Mae said. “Keeps us honest.”

Ruth offered each of us a firm handshake, friendly but efficient. “If you feel like earning your supper, I’ll put you to real work by morning,” she said, not unkind. “We’ll need an early start. Rain took the soil from the east row.”

Nick grinned. “I can dig.”

“Good,” Ruth said. “You’ve got the arms for it.”

Hailey’s smile stiffened, a quick flash of something territorial crossing her face before she looked away.

Ruth moved on before it turned awkward, humming a tune under her breath that I couldn’t place, something old and crooked, like a lullaby remembered halfway.

From there, Mae led us along a fence line toward the barn. A man about my age stood at a sagging gate, coaxing a hinge back into shape with a handful of nails and a hammer. A wheat stem parked at the corner of his mouth, and an easy grin on his face.

“Jonah,” Mae said. “If it’s broken, he’ll fix it. If it’s not broken, he’ll fix it anyway.”

Jonah stuck out a hand to Nick first, then me. His palm was rough but warm. “Ah, a city boy,” he added, friendly. “We’ve got a rehab program for soft hands.”

Nick laughed. “I think he prefers to supervise.”

“Supervisors get blisters too,” Jonah said. “Ruth sees to it.”

From the barn loft, a skinny young man whistled and waved before vanishing again.

“That’ll be Silas,” Jonah said, amused. “Don’t feed him after dark.”

“Silas,” I repeated.

“You’ll know him when you know him,” Jonah said.

Mae and Abel led us on toward the animal pens. Chickens scratched in the dirt near a small shed. A girl sat among them, legs crossed, braiding flowers into her hair. For a moment I thought she was much younger than she was supposed to be, thirteen, maybe fourteen at most. Barefoot, dress hem torn.

When she noticed us, she scrambled up and dusted off her knees. “You’re new,” she said.

Elenor smiled. “We are.”

The girl’s eyes darted to Elenor’s hand, to the ring there. “Pretty,” she whispered, then paused, thoughtful. “Do you like lemon or blackberry better?”

“For what?” Elenor asked, laughing.

“Just better.”

“Blackberry.”

The girl nodded like she’d been given an answer to a riddle, and hurried off, bare heels flashing in the dust.

Abel watched her go, something like pride softening his features. “And that’s Clara,” he said. “That girl collects sunbeams like they’re chores.”

We passed the tank Abel had mentioned, black-ribbed, cool in the shadow of the house. A tin ladle hung from a nail beneath the spigot. Beside it, a hand-lettered sign: GUEST WATER.

Past the tank, the land rolled down toward a line of trees that gathered thick and dark at the edge of a field. From somewhere inside them, you could hear water, not loud, not obvious, just the steady hush of it, like someone whispering in the next room.

Elenor cocked her head. “Do you hear that?”

“Wind in the leaves,” Abel said easily, though there wasn’t any wind. “Best to keep out of those woods. Curiosity’s a debt that doesn’t stop collecting once you owe it.”

Mae laid a hand on his arm, her voice soft but certain. “He’s right. Plenty of guests have come back from those woods with twisted ankles and bloodied shins. The ground turns mean out there, best to keep to the flat land where it’s kind.”

“Aye.” Abel agreed absently.

I smiled like I believed them, but I could tell the warning wasn’t about the terrain.

We looped back toward the house before the light could decide which way to fall. Just to the right of the main house stood a small guest cabin, two narrow bedrooms split by a short hall, with a shared washroom tucked behind it under a sloped awning.

“This one’s for you two,” Mae said, pointing to the door on the left. “And the one down the hall is for your brother and Hailey.”

Elenor ran her fingers over an embroidered quilt. “It’s beautiful,” she said.

Mae nodded. “The hands that make things put love in them. That’s what lasts.”

Then she left us alone, her footsteps fading into the hall.

El wandered the small space, opening drawers, smiling at the little note on the bedside table: *Welcome, Alex & Elenor.*

“This is so cute,” El said. “It’s like staying at a museum you can touch.”

I stood at the window and watched Harlan cross the yard with a log slung over one shoulder. He carried it the way I’d carry a backpack: absent, unbothered. For a second, his eyes lifted and met mine through the glass. Not hostile. Not curious. Just a long, flat look with something old behind it. Then he went back to the work that was already finished in his mind.

“I’m gonna find a washroom,” El said, squeezing my shoulder as she passed.

“Oh, alright, I’ll wait out front.”

I stepped outside. The air had grown heavier, the gold of it deep enough to taste. Abel stood at the edge of the porch, lighting a lantern, the match burning close to his fingers before he bothered to shake it out.

“It’s quiet here,” I said, walking up beside him.

He watched the flame steady behind the glass. “Sometimes the things that change us are quieter than we imagine,” he said. “By the time you see them, they feel like they were always part of you.”

The lantern light flickered against his face, carving the lines deeper. From inside came Mae’s voice.

“Supper,” she called.

Abel hung the lantern on its hook and straightened. El, Nick, and Hailey stepped out from the guest cabin at the same time, drawn by the sound of a dinner bell.

Abel held the door open for all of us, that same patient calm still in his eyes.

“Come eat,” he said. “You’ll need your strength for the morning.”

\*\*\*

The dining room was long and low, wood-dark and humming with warmth. Lanterns lined the walls, their glass fogged from heat, their light folding everything in amber. The table dominated the room, one heavy plank of cedar that looked older than anyone sitting around it.

Bowls steamed between us. Mae moved quietly, ladling stew with the slow confidence of repetition. “Don’t be shy,” she said, smiling. “The food tastes better when it disappears.”

Abel sat at the head of the table, posture upright but easy, like he’d been carved that way. Harlan sat near the door, shoulders filling his corner, silent as he had been since we’d arrived. Ruth and Jonah faced each other like a pair long used to working side by side. Silas lounged two seats down, tipping his chair on one leg.

It was hard not to feel like we’d wandered into someone else’s rhythm—a pattern mid-beat.

The family didn’t speak much at first. Only the sound of spoons scraping bowls, of Mae refilling plates before anyone could ask.

Mae broke the silence with a smile. “You’ve met most of us already, haven’t you?”

Nick nodded, mouth full. “Think so.”

She gestured gently with her spoon. “Ruth runs the garden and keeps us all fed. Jonah fixes what time breaks. Silas… tries to help.”

That earned a faint laugh from the others.

Silas grinned. “You’re just jealous I work smarter, not harder.”

“Smarter?” Ruth said. “Is that what you call hiding in the loft?”

“Observation deck,” he said. “Better view.”

Jonah snorted. “Better excuse.”

Abel didn’t look up, but the corner of his mouth twitched.

Even Mae chuckled softly, shaking her head. “You see what I live with.”

Elenor smiled at that. “Feels like home already.”

“Hopefully not too much,” Mae said gently. “The world out there’s a hard habit to break.”

Nick gestured toward me with his fork. “We’re the reason you’ve got two city folks at your table. Figured they could use a break from concrete.”

Elenor smiled. “And smog. Don’t forget the smog.”

Hailey grinned. “And rent.”

I laughed softly. “Yeah, mostly rent. City’ll charge you for air if you let it.”

Mae tilted her head. “And yet you stayed.”

I thought about it. “Habit, I guess. You work so hard to afford a life, you forget to live it.”

Abel raised his glass slightly. “Quiet’s not free either,” he said. “You just pay for it differently.”

The fire popped. Nobody spoke for a moment.

Then Mae’s voice softened. “Where’s Granddad tonight?”

Abel didn’t look up from his plate. “In his room,” he said. “Said he needed to listen awhile.”

Jonah nodded, swallowing. “The ground’s been stirring again.”

Mae nodded like that made sense. It didn’t.

The door creaked open behind us.

A girl stepped in, barefoot, dress smudged with dirt. Her braid hung loose, and there were dark stains beneath her fingernails—not wet, but not old either.

Clara.

She kept her eyes down, slipping into her chair like she’d been there all along. Mae placed a bowl in front of her without a word.

Silas leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table. “You wash up with mud now, kid?”

Clara ignored him.

He grinned wider. “Guess that’s one way to blend in with the pigs.”

Jonah gave a quiet “Silas,” under his breath, but it did nothing.

Silas dipped his spoon, flicked a bit of stew at her sleeve. “Missed a spot.”

She looked up, expression calm but flat. “You done?”

“Just making conversation.”

“Try harder,” she said, voice low.

Silas laughed, a dry, empty sound. “Careful, sister. You’re starting to sound like Ruth.”

That was when Harlan stood.

The chair’s scrape cut through everything. He didn’t say a word, didn’t need to. His shadow stretched the length of the table.

Silas’ grin faltered. “Kidding,” he said softly. “Just kidding.”

Abel didn’t raise his voice. “Harlan.”

The big man’s head turned slightly.

“Sit.”

He did.

Then Abel looked at Silas, calm and final. “You don’t sharpen a knife on family.”

Silas nodded once, eyes low. “Yes, sir.”

The room exhaled.

Clara finally glanced at Harlan, the ghost of a smile curling at her mouth. “Calm down, big guy. I can handle him.”

A few small laughs slipped through the tension. Mae’s hand brushed Clara’s shoulder as she passed, steadying, grounding.

The meal carried on—slower now, but softer. Ruth asked Nick about his work, curious in a quiet, measured way. Mae asked Elenor about her ring, her smile genuine. Abel mostly listened, weighing silences.

The food was rich, the warmth steady. But every so often, I caught myself noticing the details: like how the family drank from old, earthen mugs instead of the clear glasses set for us, I couldn’t quite tell what they were drinking.

Abel’s hand rested near his cup, but his eyes kept drifting toward the window, as if something out there was listening too.

When Mae finally rose, she did so gently, her voice the soft close of a hymn. “You’ve all had a long day. Tomorrow starts early. The light comes quick here.”

Abel stood as well, his chair groaning. “Rest well,” he said. “Work or not, everyone contributes here.”

\*\*\*

Back in the guest bathroom, the air felt cooler. Hailey leaned against the sink, hair tied up, a half-drunk glass of wine in her hand.

“They’re nice,” she said, “but that was... different.”

Nick grinned, rolling up his sleeves as he washed his hands. “Different’s good. I didn’t see anyone glued to a phone.”

“Maybe because they took them all,” Hailey said. “Pretty sure that counts as kidnapping.”

Elenor sat on the edge of the counter, towel over her lap. “They just have their way of doing things. It’s kind of refreshing, actually.”

“Until they say grace over a fresh guest stew,” Hailey muttered.

Nick chuckled. “Hey, you’re the one who wanted to come. You’re just paranoid.”

“I’m aware,” she said, taking another sip. “Doesn’t mean I’m wrong.”

I turned on the tap. It gurgled, coughed, then fell silent. Elenor pointed to the black drum in the corner. “Guest water,” she said.

Hailey crossed her arms. “It’s weird we can’t even use the tap. What happens if you forget?”

Nick shrugged. “Guess you don’t forget.”

Elenor smiled faintly. “You guys think too much. It’s just plumbing.”

“Maybe,” Hailey said, glancing toward the window. “Or maybe it’s something else.”

Nick stepped behind her, pressing a kiss to her temple. “It’s just old pipes, babe. We’re fine.”

She relaxed slightly, smiling despite herself. “Fine. But if I start growing gills, I’m blaming you.”

Elenor laughed softly. “God, you’re dramatic.”

“Occupational hazard,” Hailey said. “I like to keep the mood lively.”

The light flickered once and steadied.

Nick stretched, yawning. “Alright, campers. Big day tomorrow.”

Elenor stood, brushing her hair over one shoulder. “You coming?”

“In a sec,” I said, glancing at the window one last time. The farmhouse glowed faintly through the trees, lanterns still burning inside.

Elenor touched my arm. “Come on.”

I followed her, closing the door softly behind us.

The night felt thick around us, the air cool and wet. Above, the stars burned sharp and endless—millions of diamonds I’d forgotten the city had stolen from me.

\*\*\*

The guest cabin held the day’s warmth like a kept secret.

The lantern on the dresser hissed low, its flame cupped in glass, throwing a soft amber sway across the walls. Outside, the crickets had gone still. The quiet wasn’t empty, just dense, like a blanket pulled over the night.

Elenor sat cross-legged on the bed, brushing her hair. I watched her reflection in the small mirror: the way her eyes didn’t quite look at herself but at the space around her, as if the room were a pond and she was checking what moved beneath the surface.

“You know,” she said softly, “for a place this quiet, it doesn’t feel empty.”

I was half-lying on the quilt, propped on one elbow. “No. It doesn’t.”

She set the brush down and turned, that small smile widening just enough to reach me. She looked like home, the kind that makes you forget what time is doing to you.

When she crawled into bed, the quilt lifted with a papery whisper. Her palm found my chest, tracing slow, absent shapes. Her knee brushed mine; the mattress sighed, old but steady.

“You think they’re asleep already?” she whispered.

I glanced toward the door. “Feels like the whole farm is.”

She smiled. “Then I guess it’s just us.”

She kissed me, soft at first, then deeper, the kind of kiss that pulls the world in close. My hand slipped to the back of her neck, her pulse warm beneath my thumb. The lantern light wavered and set our shadows breathing on the walls.

We moved the way you do when you’re trying not to wake a house: slow, familiar, reverent. For a while, the world was only breath and skin and the heat of being known.

She laughed softly into my neck. “You packed the condoms, right?”

“Drawer,” I murmured.

Her hand reached past me, the drawer giving a small wooden sigh. A rustle, then stillness.

“They’re not here.”

I blinked. “What?”

“The condoms. You sure you packed them?”

I leaned over and looked into the drawer. No box. No wrappers.

“I swear I put them right there. Maybe Nick stole 'em?” I said. “We’ll check in the morning.”

“Yeah,” she said quietly. “Morning.”

She came back to me, though the rhythm was different now, something cautious beneath the warmth.

Then I felt it: the smallest thread of air against my ankle, cool, damp, shaped like a breath slipping through the crack beneath the door.

I froze.

Elenor did too. Our breathing fell out of sync.

“What?” she whispered.

The quiet had shifted tones, same silence, different weight.

A board bent. Not the lazy sigh of old wood, but a careful test of pressure. Then a pause. And in that pause came a breath: long, uneven, dragged through a throat that didn’t quite know how to be quiet. A wet, rasping inhale.

Elenor’s hand tightened on my arm. “Alex.”

The door wasn’t shut all the way. A thin seam of dark where wood should’ve met wood. I remembered closing it, remembered the click. The gap was small, but wide enough to imagine an eye behind it.

“We closed that,” I said, barely above air.

The breathing came again, slow and steady, a soft gurgle like a man half drowning.

“Nick?” El tried.

Silence answered. Then another soft exhale, hot and damp, threading through the crack.

I slipped from the bed. The floor met my feet like ice. The lamp’s glow reached only halfway across the room, beyond that, everything was a suggestion.

“I’ll check,” I whispered.

“Alex, don’t—”

But I was already opening the door.

Nothing.

The hall pressed in close, walls breathing with the heat of the day. The lamp at the far end had burned down to an amber pulse. My heart made too much sound.

I stepped toward Nick and Hailey’s door, the boards groaning softly beneath my weight. A line of light glowed under their door, steady, human. I knocked lightly.

“Nick.”

A muffled voice came from the other side. “Jesus, man. You good?”

“Did you hear anything? Breathing? Steps?”

There was a pause. Sheets rustling. Hailey’s tired voice somewhere in the mix. Nick laughed, low and hoarse. “Pretty sure that was you, dude. You two aren’t exactly subtle.”

“Not that,” I said. “Someone was outside our door.”

His tone changed. “You serious?”

“Yeah.”

He hesitated, then said, “Probably the wind. This place creaks like hell.”

“Yeah,” I said. “Probably.”

But the air didn’t move. Not even a whisper.

When I turned back, my throat went dry.

The front door of the guest cabin was standing wide open.

Beyond it, the night was a flat sheet of black. The curtain beside the frame swayed once, then stopped dead.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. Something had either just left—or entered.

“Nick,” I called softly, but their door stayed shut.

Wearing nothing but my boxers, I took a step toward the open doorway. The air that started to pour in from outside was cold, metallic, carrying the smell of wet leaves and soil. The yard stretched beyond: a wash of colorless shapes, the fence like a spine against the horizon.

And then it hit me like a stone to the gut: *Elenor*.

I ran for our room, hoping, praying, that something hadn’t reached her before I could.

The boards wailed under me. The lamp flickered once, as if flinching from the noise. I reached our door, my hand slapping the wood as I went to push it open, but my palm landed on something warm.

Not warm like sun-touched wood. Warm like skin. Damp. The kind of warmth that lingers after a mouth.

I yanked my hand back. Someone had been standing there. Breathing against the door.

I shoved it open.

Elenor sat up in bed, eyes wide. “Jesus—Alex?”

I scanned the room. Empty. Just the lantern glow, the quilts, the open drawer.

“Door was open,” I said. My voice didn’t sound like mine.

“What?”

“The front door. Wide open.”

She stared at me. The silence between us felt like static.

I shut our door hard and twisted the latch until it caught. Then dragged the chair from the corner and jammed it under the knob.

“If that door opens again, I’m going to lose my shit.”

Elenor’s eyes followed me as I climbed back into bed. “You sure it wasn’t the wind?”

“No,” I said. “Not the wind.”

We didn’t touch. The air between us felt thick—watched.

As I sat awake and watched the door fade into shadow, I swore I could still hear breathing softly through the wood, like the cabin itself had learned the rhythm of our sleep, and was keeping time.",1,1765328094.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

When I met him in person, we said hello and stood in line to get coffee. I went first and paid for my coffee. I’ll be honest, I was a little turned off that he didn’t offer to pay, but not necessarily upset and typically have no specific issue paying for my own! But I really like a gentlemen, especially on the first date. Then when we sat down, the conversation was okay, but kind of hard to keep it going. I honestly felt like he was a little disengaged. I’m usually pretty good at making conversation but it just didn’t flow and I felt like I had to keep thinking of things to talk about. Then he ended the date early, said he had a really nice time and unmatched a few days later. 

I’ve never had this happen in a date before (I haven’t dated a ton) but still! Do you think he was unattracted to me right off the get go? I know I shouldn’t be so concerned but it did bruise my ego a bit. 🥲 ALSO, if anyone has had this experience too lmk. ",1,1765328052.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

My brother told me how happy he was with how this worked out last time we spoke on the phone.

Today, I was on the phone with my mom, and she went to make a cup of coffee, but smoke was coming from her coffee machine, and I got worried, asking if she had the fire extinguisher nearby. She told me it was packed away (due to the house being sold and her having hosted viewings beforehand), but said I didn’t need to worry, as she was going to get a new coffee machine in the next couple of days, anyway, and normally, I would’ve let it go here, but today, it became a conflict, cause I knew about my brother’s present and didn’t want that to be ruined.

I suggested she use one of the old coffee maker or coffee pots we have lying around the house, but they were all packed away. I suggested she could borrow one from my brother for a few days, if they had any extra, but she didn’t think they did, and didn’t see the point, as she needed a new one anyway. At this point, I texted my brother, and at his suggestion, I suggested she wait till January, to get one at a New Year’s sale, and at this point, she was getting annoyed with me and asked me to stop trying to solve this for her, saying some were on sale rn, too (meaning she was clearly already looking them up, which made my situation feel even more urgent if I wanted to save Christmas from her ending up with two coffee machines). I tried again to say that maybe she could at least think about it for a bit and borrow one temporarily, and told her I’d texted my brother already, and that he said he did have an extra, and she asked me to just stop and let her figure this out herself. I would have, except this was kind of a difficult situation, and I knew she’s understand later, but I didn’t want her to feel I wasn’t respecting her boundaries either, so I resorted to giving her the same hint she used to give my brother and I before Christmas when we were kids and wanted to buy ourselves something she or my grandparents had already bought us, saying “Hey, maybe wait until after Christmas?”, and she kept telling me to let her figure this out herself, and I went “Hey, maybe wait until after CHRISTMAS”, and she still didn’t get it, stating this was a clear boundary for her as she’d been controlled by my douchebag dad (no longer in the picture) for years, and she needed to make her own decision, and I tried to reiterate that I wasn’t trying to control her and asked her to really listen when I said “Please wait until after *CHRISTMAS*”, highlighting the word as much as I could, but she didn’t get it and hung up on me. 

I called my brother, who proceeded to call, her, and he also told her not to get it till after Christmas. He told her a few times before he believed she got it, and then he called me back saying he was pretty sure she eventually got the hint when we both said it, and that she clearly wasn’t upset with me or anything, we’d just misunderstood each other. I asked if he was sure she got the hint, and he was very clear that yes, she did absolutely get the hint. 

I called her back, thinking she would’ve realized how big of a misunderstanding this was, and that we could both laugh at it now, but she immediately started telling me off for not listening, earlier, when she was trying to set a boundary, and was clearly still upset. I tried to agree that I normally wouldn’ve listened, but also said I hope she understood why I kept pushing this time, and this is when it became clear she hadn’t gotten the hint at all, cause she really didn’t, and kept trying to assert her boundary around me needing to listen and letting her figure stuff out herself. I understand that, if she didn’t get the hint, but I’ve also been going through a lot and really struggling with my mental health lately, and I’m as traumatized from my dad constantly scapegoating me as she is from him controlling her, so when she was still mad at me, I kind of just started crying, cause I didn’t know how to end this without either sincerely apologizing for trying to control her when I hadn’t been (and then she would suddenly understand when she opened her Christmas present from my brother and immediately feel terrible when she had the context for the situation) or telling her outright that it was a Christmas present. I tried to get her to listen to me when I said I normally would have but this was different without revealing anything else a few more times, and I kept being told off, which would’ve been so fair if she didn’t know the context, but which was so hurtful to me when I was just trying to help, and I eventually snapped and went “This isn’t even about me! I’m not even part of this situation! This is between you and my brother, and I’m just trying to help!”, and apparently, this was the moment where she FINALLY connected the Christmas present dots, and she went quiet for a second before saying “Are you revealing something your brother doesn’t want you to reveal?”, and I said “What? No”, and she said “If you’re not part of this and your brother is part of this, then maybe you should talk to him before you talk to me”, and I said I did, and asked if she didn’t talk to him, and she said that all he said was that it wasn’t a good financial idea to pay for it before Christmas, so now I was the bad guy for “revealing something my brother didn’t want me to”, and I damn near just gave up, cause it’s not like I could tell her that “no, my brother thought you already got the hint” without revealing for sure that it was a Christmas present, so I just went “I mean, it’s his coffee maker you could borrow”, and she said that she could’ve figure that out herself, and I was clearly the bad guy for trying to control her again, and I didn’t know how to end this. I eventually just said “we were having two different conversations. I do respect your boundaries, but we were having two different conversations, and my brother agrees, and you’ll understand it later. You keep talking to me like I need to learn some great lesson about respecting your boundaries, but I DO, and this is just different, and you’ll understand later - this situation won’t happen again. I just need us to let it go now”, and this apparently confirmed the Christmas present thing for her, so now she said she felt horrible and needed to just rest, and said she understood that I was coming at this from a different viewpoint, but that she just didn’t understand why I wouldn’t let it go. And now I feel horrible for having revealed that and made her feel horrible, but I guess it’s all just trauma coming up and our neurodivergent struggle with taking and understanding hints.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

However, he’s a very kind person. Anytime there’s some thing I am having trouble with he drops everything to help if asked. He’s also opened up to me a lot about his past and it turns out we’ve lived pretty similar lives. He’s kind of touchy with me and I catch him staring at me a lot. He also follows me pretty closely online, viewing every little thing I post.

I tried asking if he’d like to coffee with me sometime, but he had no idea I was actually asking him out on a date! He’s mentioned that he has a lot of trouble understanding, social cues and people in general. Just when I was about to tell him that was what I was trying to do something happened and now I’m wondering if I should just give up and leave him alone.

He asked me to dance, so that’s what we did. Then, just as I was about to tell him that I was trying to ask him out on a date this girl pushed me out of the way, and was just immediately all up on him.

Fairly good Japanese ♡ LINE/Mixi2 ready.

5'11"" (180 cm) bear build — trimmed beard, thick arms, broad chest. Boyish smile under the beard.

About me:

* Cook cast-iron steaks here, okonomiyaki and oden when I’m in Japan
* Retro games (SNES co-op nights), spooky movies, history books at 2 a.m., perfect pour-over coffee
* Travel rhythm: long summers traveling, Midwest winters, always planning the next flight

What I want most:  
I’ve loved deeply before, though I’ve never been married. I know how rare and precious that quiet, intense love is — the kind where every day we choose each other, support each other, and slowly build the exact life we both dream of.

That’s what I’m ready for now: one woman, one home (whether in Indiana or Japan), mornings making coffee together, evenings with your head on my chest, and decades of taking care of each other.  
I will always take the lead, but I lead with my whole heart.

You:

* Japanese (living in Japan right now, or already in the US)
* 23–46
* Looking for something serious that leads to living together forever
* Petite is a big plus (the height difference is perfect)
* Bonus if you like retro games, cooking together, or spooky movies

A little more about the woman I hope writes me:  
You’re kind, thoughtful, and value loyalty above everything. You want a partner who listens on the hard days and celebrates the small wins with you. You dream of building a home filled with quiet rituals we create together — quiet mornings, shared meals, planning the next trip. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to be ready to choose “us” every single day, the same way I will.

Reply with:

1. One thing you’d love to do together on a lazy Sunday
2. Where you are right now (city/prefecture in Japan, or US city)
3. One question for me

I mispronounced the drink name, which confused the barista. I tried to correct myself mid-order. Mistake number two. Suddenly, I mixed up my order with the person behind me. They corrected me, I apologized, and then my phone rang at full volume in my pocket—music blasting. I tried to silence it but instead knocked over my iced coffee, which spilled on the counter, dripped onto the floor, and nearly took out the tip jar.
The barista stared at me like I had committed a felony. I apologized, mopped what I could with napkins, and somehow the iced coffee ended up on my shoes anyway. I left Starbucks feeling like I had survived a minor warzone.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I received a Breville Bambino and Baratza Encore ESP for my birthday as a first foray into the world of making espresso at home, and have enjoyed beginning my journey. My parents are looking for Christmas gift ideas, and I thought it could be a nice time to upgrade some of the equipment and/or add accessories.

Here are some ideas I've considered, as an only partly informed novice:

* bottomless portafilter (I don't love the dual-spout one that comes with the machine, since I often get a stream from one side and only drips from the other)
* better tamper (the original plastic one is the part of the package that feels the cheapest, for sure!)
* a WDT tool (right now I just use a metal skewer from the ""kitchen random drawer"" haha)
* a single dose hopper with bellows for the Baratza

Location: I am in the US

Preferred drink: I drink straight espresso; my wife prefers milk drinks, erring toward cortado/macchiato as opposed to latte

Drink frequency: I pull a double shot most mornings for me, a double shot 1-2x/week for my wife, and 1-2x/week an additional decaf double shot or two in the afternoon/evening

Y'all are the best...looking forward to what everyone has to say!

# Chapter 1 – The Awakening

The rain wouldn’t shut up.

It didn’t speak in words- nothing that clean- but it had a way of insisting on itself: soft impacts on the glass, tiny rushes as drops slipped down and merged, the occasional tap when one hit the frame just right. Vicky sat cross-legged on her bed with a paperback open over her knees, but the page had stopped meaning anything a while ago. The sentences had dissolved into grey, ink turning to motion without content.

Across the room, the cheap plastic clock tried to tick. Every few seconds it seemed to lose its grip, the second-hand stuttering before it remembered which way to go.

She watched that instead of the story. If the clock behaved, the day was ordinary. If it didn’t...

The second hand skipped backwards once, then jerked forward, as if embarrassed.

Her room was small and obedient: pale wallpaper, narrow desk, wardrobe with a door that never quite shut, the low hum of a computer in sleep mode. In the evenings, though, it felt… aware. Not in a haunted-house way. More like a person pretending to keep reading when they’ve already noticed you’re looking at them.

She rubbed at the inside of her left wrist. The itch wasn’t on the skin; it lived just under it, like a half-remembered word she couldn’t drag into focus.

*Who am I, really?*

The thought was old. It came around when she was too tired to fight it off. She would never say it aloud. People already thought she was weird enough- quiet girl, book girl, the one who flinched at mirrors. The reflection never quite matched. Sometimes its blink came a fraction late, or its smile didn’t land in the same place on the face.

Outside, the streetlamps flicked on one by one. Their light ran down the wet window like molten orange, stretching her reflection into vertical smears. A pale oval of face, hair pulled back in a knot she’d stopped bothering to redo, dark eyes that always looked slightly surprised to find themselves there.

For a moment- just long enough for her pulse to jump- there was another outline behind her in the glass. A second figure, blurred, standing too close to her shoulder.

She turned around.

Bed. Wardrobe. Pile of clothes that should’ve made it into the laundry two days ago. No one.

The radiator clicked and hissed, expanding with the warm water. The rain kept counting itself down the glass. Her heart calmed in small, unwilling steps.

“Stop it,” she told herself. Not the room. Herself.

The clock’s second hand swept on, perfectly reasonable.

—————————————————————————————————————

She gave up on the book and moved to the desk. The computer had dragged itself out of sleep in her absence; the screen glowed that particular washed-out blue only old monitors managed, haloing dust motes as they drifted through. She opened a blank document, intending to jot down… something. A line. A thought. A sentence that had sounded clever in the shower and then refused to arrive fully dressed.

Nothing came.

The silence thickened around her. It wasn’t the absence of sound- there were plenty of those: the fridge rumbling downstairs, a car passing, a neighbour’s television leaking laughter through the floorboards. This was a different kind of silence, the sort that feels like sharing a room with someone who’s waiting for you to speak first.

The speakers popped.

Just once. A tiny exhale of static. Not loud enough to be a fault, not long enough to blame on anything obvious.

Vicky frowned. Her internet cable dangled loose behind the tower; the house router had died in a power surge three days ago and no one had had time to replace it yet. The machine had no business talking to anything.

Grey letters slid onto the screen.

They weren’t typed. They just… appeared, one by one, each arrival accompanied by a soft mechanical click her fingers hadn’t made.

*WHO ARE YOU?*

Her mouth went dry. She stared at the words until they blurred, half expecting them to rearrange into something sensible.

They didn’t.

Another line blinked into existence beneath the first.

*DO YOU REMEMBER?*

A laugh rose and died in her throat. Of course it was a glitch. A virus. Some leftover program finally falling apart. Or she’d nodded off and this was the kind of dream that liked pretending it wasn’t one.

Somewhere behind the fear, the question landed with a strange, familiar weight. Remember *what*?

Her reflection in the dark part of the screen trembled, the outline of her face rippling like it had been drawn on the surface of water.

She reached forward, meaning to slam the lid shut, or yank the power cord, or do anything that would turn the whole thing into an empty black rectangle again.

Her fingertips met warmth.

Not heat from the monitor. Not static. Warmth the way skin was warm. As if, on the other side of the glass, someone had lifted a hand at exactly the same moment.

She pulled back sharply.

The letters blinked off. The desktop returned. No document, no message, no trace.

Her wrist burned, one sharp pulse.

—————————————————————————————————————

She woke with her cheek stuck to the desk.

Light knifed in through the window at the wrong angle for night. Her neck throbbed in protest as she straightened, joints clicking. The monitor had given up and gone to sleep. The little green power LED watched her like a single half-lidded eye.

Had she blacked out? Fallen asleep? There was no taste of dream in her mouth- just that dry, stale feeling that meant too little water and too much thinking.

The itch in her wrist had changed.

She turned her arm over. Under the skin, just where the blue veins fanned out toward the hand, something faintly luminous pulsed once, then again. Silver, thin as thread, there and gone.

She pressed her thumb against it. The glow spread for a heartbeat under the pressure, a tiny fan of light, and then faded, leaving nothing but the ghost of warmth and the hammering of her own pulse in her ears.

“Okay,” she said to the empty room. “That’s new.”

Her phone buzzed on the desk. A text from her mother.

*Breakfast.*

Just that. No heart emojis, no punctuation. Her mother’s way of saying I’m here and I’m trying not to overreact.

The ordinariness of it steadied her. She grabbed the phone like a lifeline, pocketed it, and stood up. The chair legs squealed too loud against the floor.

Downstairs, the smell of toast and coffee held the house together. The kitchen was small and warm; steam fogged the window over the sink. Her mother sat at the table in her work blouse, hair still damp around the edges, a tablet propped against the sugar jar.

“You’re late,” she said, without looking up. Then she did look and frowned. “You look pale. Nightmares?”

Vicky hesitated. “Just… couldn’t sleep.”

“That’s different,” her mother said. She tapped something on the tablet, then set it down and pushed a mug toward her. “Drink. Then go be brilliant at school. Or at least convincingly present.”

The joke landed crooked in the air. Vicky managed a small smile anyway and wrapped both hands around the mug. The heat soaked in slowly, chasing the last of the monitor’s ghost from her fingers.

Ordinary. Plates. Crumbs. The slow tick of the wall clock. None of it shimmered or doubled or asked who she was.

She sipped, listening for any hint of that other rhythm under the everyday sounds. For a moment she almost forgot what she was listening for.

Almost.

—————————————————————————————————————

Rhea’s Neoart College stood between the old town square- with its high iron statues- and a museum, built a couple of years ago, that was too bright against the grey of the area.

Today school was too loud.

The noise wasn’t any worse than usual- shouts, slammed lockers, overlapping gossip- but it all arrived through an invisible buffer, a pane of glass a few centimetres from her skin. Everything sounded slightly delayed, like someone had recorded the morning and was playing it back half a second out of sync.

She moved through it carefully, keeping her bag close, her eyes down. The corridor lights flickered once as she passed beneath them. The second flicker didn’t happen; her brain supplied it anyway.

“Morning, Vicky,” someone said. She nodded without seeing who it was. Faces blurred into composites when she tried to look straight at them, as if the world hadn’t quite decided which version of itself to run.

Classroom. Same chipped desks, same whiteboard. Mr Hughes had already started writing when she slid into her usual seat.

PERCEPTION, he wrote in big block capitals. Underneath, smaller:

AND REALITY.

Her stomach tightened.

He turned, chalk dust on his fingers. “All right,” he said. “Today we talk about what you *think* you see.”

The words hit in the wrong order. Think. You. See. She knew this lesson. Not the content- his rhythm. The way his hand moved when he underlined something. The tilt of his head when he asked a question he already knew most of them would fumble.

Had she dreamed this?

Her pen sat useless in her hand. She watched it. It didn’t move until she told it to.

“Perception,” Hughes went on, “is the brain’s best guess. You don’t see the world as it is. You see the version your mind stitches together from signals. It’s efficient. It’s also… lazy.”

A few people chuckled.

Vicky stared at the board. The letters doubled. For a moment there were two PERCEPTIONS, slightly out of alignment. When she blinked, they snapped back into one.

Her wrist pulsed. Once. Twice.

“Vicky?” Hughes’ voice cut through, closer than it should’ve been. “You with us?”

She looked up.

The classroom was gone.

—————————————————————————————————————

Glass stretched away in both directions. Floor, walls, ceiling—all transparent, all too bright, the light pressing in from every angle. Beyond the glass, shadows moved, slow and imprecise, like shapes seen through water. She couldn’t tell if they were people or ideas of people.

Her own breath fogged nothing. Her footsteps made no sound.

“Hello?”

Her voice came back a beat late, same word, wrong timing. The echo sounded unimpressed.

She took a step forward. The ground gave a little, a soft ripple underfoot, like walking on a pond that had decided to pretend to be solid. Her reflection walked with her, stretched beneath her like a second body trapped under ice.

Far ahead, someone was standing in the corridor.

Small. Still. Waiting.

Another girl, about her size. Same hair. Same outline.

She stopped. The other didn’t.

As the figure came into focus, Vicky felt the understanding before the detail arrived, the way you recognise a song from a single chord.

It was her.

The other girl smiled, and the whole corridor bent imperceptibly around it.

You shouldn’t be awake.

The words didn’t come from the girl’s mouth. They were everywhere at once—behind Vicky’s eyes, in the vibrating glass, under the skin of her wrist.

She tried to answer. “Where am I?” she meant to say, or “Who are you?”, or “How do I get out?” Her tongue moved. Sound did not. Instead, somewhere under her feet, the glass cracked.

A fine line shot away in both directions, branching as it went. Light forced its way up through the fracture, bright and alive and entirely uninterested in whether it belonged here.

Her balance went with it.

The last thing she saw was the other girl’s eyes, steady and almost sad, as the floor let go.

She fell into the light.

—————————————————————————————————————

She hit air and noise and brightness.

Ceiling tiles. Strip lights. The smell of old carpet and teenage deodorant. Her desk under her palms, the edge digging painfully into her skin. A circle of faces, too close, too many.

“Vicky!” Hughes again, softer this time, alarm flattening his voice. “Easy. Easy. Take a breath.”

Her own breathing crashed back in, too fast.

The light was wrong. The edges of everything were too sharp, angles a fraction off, like the room had been rebuilt from someone else’s memory and they’d almost—but not quite—got the dimensions right.

“I…” Her tongue felt thick. “I’m fine.”

She wasn’t, but the word arrived automatically, a reflex like flinching.

“Do you need the nurse?” Hughes asked.

The thought of standing, of walking through corridors that might decide to be somewhere else halfway along, made her stomach twist.

“I’ll be okay,” she lied.

He hesitated, then nodded, shoulders loosening a fraction. “If you’re sure. Any more of that and you’re getting checked out, understood?”

Murmurs. Stolen glances. The room did the polite thing and pretended to be normal.

Vicky sat very still. The clock at the back of the classroom ticked backwards once, then corrected itself.

She looked down at her notebook.

The page shouldn’t have had time to change. She hadn’t had time to write.

Three words waited there in a hand that wasn’t hers. The ink was darker than the rest of her notes, the letters more deliberate, as if whoever had written them hadn’t been in a hurry at all.

*STAY ASLEEP, VICKY.*

Her vision tunneled for a moment. She blinked until the letters held steady.

Outside, the rain found the windows again, soft enough to sound like breathing.",1,1765326858.0,writingcirclejerk,0,1.0,False

Behind the door of 5C lives a man who survived the violence, but the injuries he brought home still bleed in the dark. His silence is a minefield, his memories the shrapnel. Inside 5C, the battlefield was gone, but the war remained. And here, every shadow is armed to the teeth, not with weapons, but with the horrors that shaped them.”

-5C-

He is alone when the bomb goes off.

One moment the street is full of voices and motion, a busy market road caught in the heat of midafternoon. Women calling out as kids dart between stalls, vendors haggling over a sale. The next moment, there is only the blurred white of it all.

The blast eats all sound first.

Air slams out of his chest. The world turns to pressure and dust. He doesn’t remember falling, only the taste of grit and burned metal as he pushes himself up, ears ringing, rifle useless weight against his shoulder.

The street is wrong now.

It is bent and twisted, color burned out of it. Tiny glass shards glitter in the air like hanging stars, catching weak sunlight pushing through the thickness of dust. The wheel of a riderless moped spins slowly in the middle of the road. A plastic bag flutters from a shattered awning. A single sandal lies in a pool of darkened viscera where the wearer once stood. The pieces of the market and the area it occupied lay scattered before him like a horrifying mosaic of destruction. 

He doesn’t look too closely at anything. He’s learned not to. He keeps his eyes on shapes, not details. Movement, not faces.

“…zero, report! Status!” Screams through the static of a radio but the voice is small, distant. His own name disappears into the whine inside his skull. His body moves slowly, instinctively, before his mind can process. His boots crunch through broken stone and glass as he moves toward the epicenter of the shockwave.

The dread builds with every step, thickening with the dust.

There is something in the street ahead. Small. Distorted. Outlined in the settling haze.

He doesn’t reach scene before the world pulls away from him like water down a drain.

He wakes sideways, halfway off his mattress, choking on the air that still smells like burned plastic.

His hand is already on the pistol.

His fingers know the weight of it before his eyes open. Cold metal, familiar patterns in the stippling of the grip. The slide, the safety. It comes up with him in a single panicked motion, barrel sweeping the dark of the room as his chest hammers.

The only light spills forward in a cone of crimson red from his flashlight, jittering in his shaking hand as he paints the walls in a blood colored wash. 
Closet. 
Door. 
Cracked ceiling. 
The cheap dresser that came with the apartment. 
The open bathroom door, a rectangle of deeper shadow.

Something stands there.

Just inside the threshold, half a head shorter than him at the shoulder. A silhouette cut out of the dark, edges soft, like smoke trying to hold a human shape. No eyes he can see, no mouth. Just a small, upright absence against the black of the bathroom.

The flashlight slips in his grip. For a second the beam shakes off the shape and when it finds it again, the thing is closer. Two steps inside the room now. The air feels thicker, heavier, caught between his lungs and his throat.

“ No… no, no, no…”

He squeezes his eyes shut, teeth clenched, the words hissed through them like a prayer and a curse at once. The pistol, pressed against his temple now, hard enough to hurt, hand shaking so badly the metal feels like it’s tapping against his skull.

He drags a breath in through his nose, holds it, counts.

“One…Two…Three.”

He opens his eyes.

The room is empty. Just the open bathroom door, the pale shape of the tub, the faint red smear of his own light sliding across tile.

He lowers the pistol slowly to his lap, the tremor in his hand lingering as it rests there. He stares at it for a long second, and only when the shaking in his hand grows to a chatter in his teeth does finally get out of bed.

He gets dressed in the dark. Shirt, jeans, boots left unlaced. The apartment feels too small, the walls too close, the ceiling too low. The air in here has gone flat with his breathing.

He has to get out.

The building doors breathe him out onto cracked pavement. The street outside is thinner, colder, but too bright. Hanging amber street lamps stain everything with a sour orange glow, and the sky above the city glows faintly with distant light pollution.

He walks.

Hands jammed deep into his pockets, shoulders rounded, head down. Every person he passes registers in his periphery: height, gait, distance, clothing, what they’re carrying, but he doesn’t look anyone in the eye. He watches their hands instead. Watches where their feet land.

He steps wide around a torn garbage bag, out into the street to avoid a cluster of bottles and paper near the curb. He knows it’s trash. Knows it isn’t anything more than that. But he still won’t walk over it.

His gaze keeps sliding to the gutters, to the gloomy mouths of storm drains, to anything that could hide metal and hate beneath it.

His mind hasn’t come to terms with the difference between here and there.

A car turns the corner ahead of him, tires hissing on wet asphalt as he slowly shifts his walk away from the street closer to the wall of the building. The vehicle rolls lazily along, music a low thump inside. When it reaches the intersection, the front wheel hits a sunken iron grate.

CLANG.

The sound is sharp and instant, metal on metal, a note that doesn’t belong to this place echoes in the hollow of his chest.

He is against the wall before thought catches up.

Shoulder slamming brick, knees bending, a crouch that’s been etched into muscle memory. His hand is on the pistol inside his waistband, his knuckles achingly white against the grip. The sound of him breathing has vanished, replaced by a high, buzzing quiet.

The city blurs at the edges.

For a second the street is full of hanging dust again, the lamps smeared into tiny suns behind it. The faint music from the car smears into distant shouting. Somewhere, far away, somebody is screaming a name he knows.

And from the wavering darkness ahead, something small steps out onto the sidewalk.

The same silhouette that was in the bathroom doorway stoically leers in front of him. Limbs vaguely human, edges flowing, as if it were made of steam and shadow instead of skin. It moves toward him without sound, drifting more than walking, a smear of deeper black against the dimming city street.

He can hear it. Not with his ears but somewhere further back, in the place where memory and noise blend together. A kind of humming cry, pitched high, trembling. It isn’t words. It’s the sound of pain stretched thin.

His thumb finds the safety.

“Stay away,” he breathes. His voice comes out as a rasp that barely clears his throat. Louder, forcing it: “Stay the fuck away from me!”

The humming grows louder, burrowing down behind his eyes. His vision pinholes. His grip tightens on the pistol until his fingers go numb.

“Leave me alone!” he shouts, squeezing his eyes shut.

When he opens them again the street has snapped back.

No dust. No smoke. Just the glow of streetlights and a paper cup tumbling along the curb. A man is standing a few yards away, startled, hands half raised like he’s not sure if the situation calls for help or distance.

“You okay man?” The stranger asks.

The man blinks. The brick wall against his back. The pistol is halfway drawn from his waistband, coat pulled tight around it. He can’t remember if he’s already spoken or just thought he did.

He backpedals, boots scraping the sidewalk.

“Hey, man, you okay? You…” the stranger says, taking a half-step forward.

The voice splinters. One shard is the man’s concern, ordinary and awkward. The other is a wail over a radio, clipped words, somebody yelling for a medic. The two sounds braid together as he turns quickly away from the stranger and runs.

Pavement slaps under his boots, but in every other stride it’s not pavement. It’s rubble, jagged and uneven, dust kicking up in small clouds with each footfall. Buildings loom on either side of him, brick and glass, then blasted concrete with rebar bones showing through. The night hum of the city becomes a low roar of engines and distantly spaced booms.

He doesn’t look back.

He doesn’t remember unlocking his door. Only slamming it behind him and twisting the deadbolt like his life depends on it.

The apartment’s usual smell of coffee and cleaning spray blends with that of burning wood and the taste of copper on his tongue. It feels wrong. Untrustworthy.

He moves on autopilot, clearing the every space and room with the pistol out, firmly gripped in his hands. He checks the tiny kitchen, the cramped hallway, the bathroom where the silhouette first stood. The bedroom, light still on from earlier, sheets twisted, darkened still by his sweat. 

Empty. Of everything except him.

He drags a chair away from the wall and sets it where he can see every doorway. The angle gives him a view of the front door, the kitchen entrance, the hall. The lamp by the door is on. The overhead in the bedroom spills a rectangle of light onto the carpet. The kitchen’s little dome light hums above an empty table. 

He kills the living room light and sits down in the dark.

The pistol rests on his thigh, his hand over it. His back finds the wall. His breathing does not want to slow down.

The bedroom light flickers.

Just a little. A hiccup in the power. The bulb dims for a heartbeat, then flares back, and in that split second of dimming, the light doesn’t look like a bulb anymore. It looks like muzzle flash that punches short, vicious bursts into the frame of the open door. He hears the chatter of automatic fire layered over the hum of the building.

He squeezes the pistol, eyes locked on that doorway.

The lamp near the front door brightens, its glow pushing hot and white along the floor. And with that brightness comes the distant, muffled sound of people screaming. A compressed mass of voices from somewhere he thought he’d left behind.

His heart crawls into his throat. Every muscle aches from being held too tight.

He keeps the weapon pointed low but ready, sliding his aim from doorway to doorway, corners, thresholds. Somewhere in the building someone drops something heavy, and the dull thud arrives in his chest as more than sound.

The kitchen light begins to flicker.

Not on and off. It sputters in place, a stuttering static buzz growing under the glass. The air beneath it ripples.

Something coalesces there.

At first it’s just darkness that refuses to move with the rest of the shadows when the light jumps. Then it thickens. Becomes a small shape standing between the stove and the table, not quite touching the floor. Edges flowing, smoke clinging together in the outline of a narrow body, narrow shoulders, a head that tilts slightly to one side.

He swings the pistol toward it.

The thing doesn’t flinch.

Its presence presses against his skin like humidity, a weight that isn’t physical but feels heavier than any body armor he’s ever worn. The static hum from the light crackles louder, crawling along the back of his neck.

“Leave me alone.” His voice barely seems to disturb the air.

The silhouette takes one slow, gliding step forward. The humming cry rises out of it again, not from a mouth but from the space it occupies, thin and sharp and endless.

He chokes on the next breath.

“Go away,” he says, the words coming out raw. “Please. Please just go.”

The arm of the shadow, if that’s what it is, lifts. It’s more suggestion than limb, a dark reach that stretches up toward the flickering light above it.

“Stop,” he says, louder now, standing without meaning to. His legs are shaking. The gun’s barrel wavers. “Stop, stop—”

The silhouette’s reaching hand meets the light.

Every bulb in the apartment goes out at once.

His shout tears out of his throat and hangs in the sudden black, where that humming cry becomes the ringing echo of the explosion again.

He is back in the street.

Smoke curls around burned-out cars and broken concrete. Fires dance here and there, licking at scraps of cloth and plastic. The shock of the blast has been replaced by an awful quiet that the world hasn’t earned.

He walks forward because he did then and because he can’t do anything else now.

Muzzle flashes strobe somewhere behind the smoke, far enough away that they function like lightning inside a storm. Voices bark orders, but the words are washed out, important only in the way they say: this is not over, this is not safe.

His boots move through dust and rubble. Every piece of twisted metal underfoot, every fragment of glass, feels like a decision he didn’t make fast enough.

He reaches the center of the blast.

The stall that used to be here is gone. The awning is blown half off, fabric charred, sagging over the street like something exhausted. A small shoe lies on its side in the middle of the road, the cartoon character on the side scorched past recognition.

A body lies a few feet away.

Small. A child. Curled slightly onto its side, one arm thrown forward. Clothes burned away to colorless rags, skin darkened by heat and soot. The hair is singed close to the scalp. The face…

He doesn’t want to look, but his gaze rises anyway.
And then he sees the face, the burned shadow he carried home with him and never outran.

The eyes are open. They are not accusing. They are not anything. They’re just empty, staring up at him through a film of ash. The small hand stretched toward him, fingers curled, seemingly reaching for his boots.

Sound drains out of his head. Even the distant gunfire goes thin, pushed to the edges by the roaring silence that fills the space where his heart is supposed to be.

He stands there a long time. Long enough that someone, somewhere, calls his name. Long enough that the smoke that moved around him settles, dusting his uniform.

He stands there.
He doesn’t move.
He doesn’t blink.
He doesn’t look away.

He comes back sitting on the floor of his apartment, the wall solid against his spine.

The pistol is in his hands, muzzle pointed somewhere near his own chest, elbows resting on his knees. His fingers have gone numb around the grip.

The lights are back on.

Bedroom bulb steady. Lamp by the door casting a quiet pool of yellow. Kitchen light humming softly, innocent, like nothing ever happened. 

The silhouette remains. 

Closer now. More defined. The outline of a child just at the age where the world should have been simple. There are no features to see, no details, but he feels them anyway. The burned fabric. The char of skin. The emptiness in the eyes.

His cheeks are wet. He hadn’t noticed when he started crying.

“I’m sorry,” he whispers.

The words snag in his throat. It takes effort to get them out.

“I’m sorry. I’m… I couldn’t…” He trails off, breath hitching. The tears come harder. It feels like something in his chest is dismantling piece by piece from the inside.

The shadow doesn’t move. Doesn’t reach. It just stands there, as if bearing witness.

“Please,” he says. Now it’s barely voice at all, just sound. “Please go. Please let me go.”

There is no answer. Only the hum of the refrigerator, the distant plumbing clank of a neighbor using water, a muffled television through a wall. Ordinary building sounds, wrapped around the thud of his own heart.

His right hand tightens on the gun.

His left comes up to meet it, habit and training taking over where thought has given out. The weight settles into both palms, familiar and final.

For a moment he just sits there, slightly rocking. Every inhale feels like pulling wire into his lungs. Every exhale like giving something up he can’t get back.

Across the room, the shape remains.

There are no more words. No more bargains to make with the thing in front of him or with the memory behind it. Just the quiet decision in the space where everything else has gone and worn thin.

The apartment breathes around him, unaware and unchanged. Down the hall, someone laughs faintly at something on TV. Pipes murmur. The building holds its breath.

His fingers find their place.

He draws one last breath.

He closes his eyes.

The silhouette.
The form.
The memory.
The regret…remains.
Stands, silent…
…and watches.

“In the end, the tenant of 5C lies still, the war inside him finally collapsing into a silence even his memories cannot cross. There is no final battle, no last stand, only the dim quiet that follows a life fighting too long against thoughts that refuse to loosen their grip. The building absorbs what remains of him and adds his name to its ledger, one more entry written in the margins of grief. Next week, we ascend to Unit 4D, where another tenant searches for an answer he should never have looked for. In that room, truth waits like a patient predator.”

- bridal party and brides parents will be in Starfleet uniform colors 
- we’re going to have Voyager (one of her favorite series) on in the living room 
- space themed decorations (star table runners)

This is not medical advice.

If you suspect something like **Candida (oral thrush)**, which often appears as a white coating on the tongue, palate, throat, or cheeks, here's a highly suggested approach:

* **Antifungal Agents:** Look for mouthwashes specifically designed for oral thrush that contain **chlorhexidine**. Other products are often ineffective(and can make it worse). **Chlorhexidine is generally the go-to agent in this scenario.**
* **Concentration:** Chlorhexidine comes in different concentrations (e.g., 0.2%, 0.5%, 2%). A pharmacist can guide you on the best type. Concentrations that are too low may not work, and those that are too high cannot be used long-term. **The goal is to find one suitable for long-term use (three times daily) that is strong enough.**
* **Application Timing:** To maximize effectiveness (as toothpaste can degrade chlorhexidine), use the mouthwash **30 minutes after brushing your teeth**. Before using it, make sure to **gently scrape your tongue** (the back of a spoon works well).
* **Boosting Effectiveness:** Mixing the mouthwash with **Xylitol** is super helpful. Xylitol is an ingredient that may inhibit bacterial adhesion; you can find it in sachets online or in some supermarkets.

# Dietary Adjustments

While using the mouthwash:

* **Eliminate Sugar and Carbs:** Try stopping sugar and carbohydrate intake for a week, including stopping items like coffee and tea (caffeine can affect sugar regulation). Remember to skip alcohol as well.
* **Supportive Foods:** Consider having plain Greek yogurt, perhaps with a small measure of Xylitol and coconut oil. The issue should resolve quickly if Candida is the root cause.

# What If the Problem Persists?

If your symptoms do not go away, the problem may be **post-nasal drip**.

* **Next Step:** See an **ENT specialist** who may prescribe nasal steroids. Post-nasal drip sometimes causes small yellow lumps to form on the back of the throat.
* **Oral Hygiene Tools:** Regardless of the cause, invest in better tools: an **electric toothbrush(Oral B)** and a **water flosser** to remove debris between teeth. Use the water flosser first, then the electric toothbrush, followed by tongue scraping, and finally the mouthwash (30 minutes later).
* **Tonsil Considerations:** If everything above fails, check for **tonsil stones** (deep on the tonsils) with a bright light. These can sometimes be tricky to locate and dislodge but are another possible cause of persistent poor breath/coating.

# Intestinal Issues (A Separate Topic)

Intestinal dysbiosis often improves on low-carb and low-sugar diets. Probiotics are complex; they can sometimes worsen issues if you have SIBO (Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth). Research into SIBO subtypes and their specific low-diet requirements (e.g., low-fermentation, low-sulfur) is advanced. It is wise to focus on the oral issues first before moving to more complex gut conditions.

Always use an Oral B tooth brush, a water flosser and spoon as a tongue scraper no matter what. Enjoy.

>If some of you have tried everything and want to learn more about Sibo, look for Professor Mark Pimentel on Youtube. He is the best in the world on this. But most of the time for breath issues, the above issues are the primary reasons. Obviously, you need to see a dentist as well to make sure you do not have a decay on one tooth or more.",1,1765326705.0,badbreath,0,1.0,False

I've tried YNAB, Mint (RIP), EveryDollar, and currently Monarch (which I barely open anymore). They all have the same problem: they want me to categorize every single transaction into a million different buckets.

I don't care if I spent $38 on gas this month vs $42 last month. I don't need separate categories for ""Dining Out"" vs ""Fast Food"" vs ""Coffee Shops."" I don't want to spend 30 minutes on setup and then 10 minutes every week maintaining it.

What I actually need:

* Household Expenses ($X/month): Mortgage, utilities, insurance - all the fixed stuff I can't control
* Fun Money ($X/month): Restaurants, gifts, hobbies, drinks - basically anything discretionary
* Everything Else: Whatever's left over

That's it. Three categories. And I just want to know: ""Am I over my $X fun money budget this month? Yes or no? If not, how much do I have left?""

Am I oversimplifying this? Do people actually benefit from tracking 50+ categories, or am I not the only one who finds that exhausting? Maybe Im missing something?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Or I wont tease them because being nice is seen as putting them on a pedestal. Unfortunately, I noticed women do respond better to guys who come this way. 

However, what if that is not your personality. I personally never like going up to girls and throwing game like that. For example, i was in a concert and my friends what me to ask a girl to dance with me. They wanted me to whisper in her ear that I thought she was attractive and I wanted a dance. I didnt want to move that way though. I wanted to attract her with my vibe instead. In fact, if a girl responded to me because I got loud and tease her, I would lose respect. I am much more into the subtle approach. Like showing genuine interest and then asking them out for coffee later. Teasing them on things that was unique to them and asking deeper questions. 

But this approach is seen as lacking bold assertiveness. Maybe I dont want to sleep with a women so quickly lol. Maybe I want it to be more about setting my eyes on a particular woman than moving to getting to know her.

1pinsf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1pinsf8/i_genuinely_cant_decide_if_i_should_end_my_life/,I genuinely can’t decide if I should end my life in January,"I’m 25, female. In June 2020 I was wanting to end it, I had just lost my job during covid and it was the last straw. I was talked out of it when I posted looking for advice on how to do it.

The person told me they were going to do it 5 years prior but were so glad they didn’t and life was amazing.
It’s been almost 5 years and I regret not doing it so badly.

I’m really not happy, I just became homeless (living in a car). I do have a full time job but the house I was renting a room in was put up for sale and I haven’t been approved anywhere new yet.

I don’t have any family or friends, it doesn’t hurt me at all but it makes me realize if I really want to end it, I won’t hurt anyone so it’s not exactly selfish or anything.

I went to community college, I just work as a receptionist at steel shop.. I make okay money but probably won’t move up.

I used to be motivated but I really don’t care if I do move up or not

It’s weird because I’m not depressed, I don’t have anxiety I just don’t want to live anymore, and I don’t feel like I have anything worth living for. And, since nobody cares about me it feels like there’s no real point in sticking around just to die anyways.

I also have to wonder, why no one ever loved me. Like there is very obviously something wrong with me, my mom passed away when I was little.

My dad found a new girlfriend and left with her, he doesn’t talk much to my brother or I.. however my mom left us both 20k and he never gave me mine. He bought my brother a 3 bedroom condo and not me.

My grandfather bought my brother a jeep, which he totaled drinking and driving… he then bought him a Hyundai. He rear ended someone and drove off, he now has no license and a brand new truck my grandfather paid for and pays insurance on.
My brother is a drug addict, who has threatened me with su*cide if I didn’t send him money, he is unemployed. This treatment goes way back too, my papa bought my brother a whole home gym when he was 12 and gave me a card with nothing in it for my birthday.. on the same day.

I’ve also never had my first kiss, never been on a date.

So I think all of this makes me think, nobody loved me even when I was younger. My brother can crash 2 vehicles and get a third one, he’s been arrested twice, dropped out of high school but gets a free condo. I don’t do anything particularly bad, and they still love him more so what the heck is wrong with me?

I have always struggled socially after moving out, and now being homeless I know I can’t let anyone in. 

So it’s like, I don’t want to be here. Nobody cares about me, and potentially the world would be better without me?

Also, clearly the only family I had hates me. If I die now I could save someone from ending up with me, sometimes guys hit on me and all I can think is you do not want to do this lol. I would never put someone through dating me I don’t think, so they should’ve safe either way this would just be a sure way 

I also don’t get excited anymore, I used to live for my morning iced coffee.. but I’ve just had so many nothing is really that exciting anymore


Then on the other hand, I’m scared to fail and end up with brain damage or something making my existence even more hellish

I am undecided still, I’m only waiting for January because I’m completing a bucket list item first week of January. My current plan is to die the day I come home, but I’m not sure 


I don’t really want advice or help, I just wanted to write out my thoughts

1pinrxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDahmerRoast/comments/1pinrxy/skeevo/,Skeevo,"Jeff trudged up the creaking stairs of the Oxford Apartments, the paper bag from the liquor store crinkling against his thigh with every heavy step, the cold Milwaukee wind chasing him through the cracked lobby door with whispers of his failures in his ear. The building was a decaying relic, its hallways reeking of stale cigarette smoke and urine-soaked carpet that felt sticky under the soles of his Hush Puppies, the flickering bulbs overhead casting long, jagged shadows that twitched along the peeling wallpaper like mocking specters. His mind churned: the sweet-rot smell that clung to him no matter where he went, the dark satisfaction of power now soured by the landlord's warning letter taped to his door and the creeping certainty that the walls were closing in.

As he reached the third-floor landing, a door slammed open to his left. The tenant from down the hall stepped out like a bear roused from hibernation: young, maybe twenty-five, black, built like he spent his days lifting engines instead of drinking them away. His arms were thick and corded under the sleeves of a grease-stained wifebeater, the kind of body that turned heads without trying. He blocked the hallway with casual arrogance, eyes narrowed under a fade haircut, gold chain glinting against dark skin.

“Hey you, Skeevo,” the man growled, voice deep and thick with contempt.

The name hit Jeff like a slap. Skeevo. That fucking name. His jaw tightened, something hot and venomous coiling in his chest, but he kept his face blank.

“Skeevo. Look at me when I'm talking to you!""

Jeff's eyes lifted reluctantly, meeting the man's glare for just a second before dropping again to somewhere around his collarbone. His throat felt tight.

""What the hell is that stink coming from your way, man? Smells like something died and started rotting. Been stinking up the whole damn floor for weeks. You got a dead body in there or what?”

Jeff froze, the bag crinkling louder as his fingers tightened around it. The barrel. The acid. The sweet-rot tang that sometimes leaked under the door. His heart hammered, shame rising hot up his neck as a quiet pressure gathered inside him.

“It’s… just a broken freezer,” he mumbled, voice small and flat, eyes fixed on the man’s scuffed work boots to avoid his glare. “Meat went bad. I’ll fix it.”

The other tenant snorted, stepping closer until Jeff could smell the beer and sweat rolling off him, the heat of his body like a wall.

“Broken freezer, my ass. Smells like death. You

better get a grip on it, freak, or I’m reporting your weird ass to management. This building don’t need no more trash stinking it up.”

Jeff’s hands shook, the bag rattling softly.

Outwardly he nodded, meek and submissive, mumbling “Sorry, I’ll handle it” as the bigger man shouldered past him with a disgusted grunt and stomped down the stairs, the gold chain swinging with each heavy step. But the second the hallway door slammed, the rage ignited.

Jeff unlocked 213 with fingers that barely worked, slammed the door behind him, and stood in the blue light, breathing like a bull. The humiliation sat like acid in his throat - \*Skeevo, like he's nothing, like he's meant to be stepped on\* - but beneath it something darker stirred.

\*Who the fuck does he think he is, talking to me like that? Just because he has a bunch of muscles.\*

That old poison rose fast. The emperor stirred, black flame licking at his insides.

\*I'd drug you. Cut you open, n\*\*er. Fuck your intestines while you wake, screaming ""fuck you, I own you.""\*

\*Power. Control.\*

He tore off his jacket and flung it across the room, the fabric slapping against the wall before sliding to the floor. Empty beer cans rolled underfoot like spent shells, cum-stained tissues lay in crumpled heaps beside the couch like shed snakeskins, glossy porn magazines scattered across the coffee table and floor, pages stuck together from repeated, frantic use. He dropped the bag on the counter, the bottle of whiskey thudding heavily, and went straight for the fridge. Budweiser first, cold and bitter and numbing. Then the VCR.

He slotted in The Exorcist III, fast-forwarded to the Gemini Killer scenes - the demon's manic grin, the taunting, the absolute dominion over life and death - and cranked the volume until the walls shook.

The force fed him, filled him, until the edges of Jeff Dahmer began to blur and dissolve. On screen, the Gemini Killer laughed, omnipotent, untouchable, and Jeff felt it, that power, seeping into his skin like radiation. He wasn't watching anymore. He was there. The apartment walls faded to nothing. He stood taller. His reflection in the dark TV screen showed someone else: the emperor, crowned and absolute, no longer the pathetic man called Skeevo in stinking hallways. Reality bent. The fantasy wasn't in his head anymore, it was here, breathing with him, bleeding into the room until he couldn't tell where the movie ended and he began.

Black Sabbath followed on the cassette deck, then Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, the bass thundering through his ribs like war drums. He stripped off his shirt, paced the narrow strip of floor, bottle in one hand, cigarette in the other, the music and the movie and the whiskey braiding together into a single, roaring current.

He approached the pornography on his coffee table. He spread a few of the magazines open, eyes devouring the sculpted chests, the thick arms, the confident cocks. That’s what power looks like, he thought, stroking himself slowly through his jeans as he stared. I could look like that. I should look like that. The arousal surged, hot and vicious, the fantasy shifting seamlessly from desire to destruction.

He saw his neighbor's muscled body in his mind, that confident swagger.

\*Called me fucking Skeevo, huh?\*

The rage blossomed full and fierce. You'll see. You'll all see. Every one of them who had sneered and hurt him like he was garbage would end up in the toilet or on his shelf for him to laugh at. You’ll see… They would kneel..

I WILL RUIN YOU. YOU’RE MINE MOTHERFUCKERS.

The emperor rose.

By midnight he was drunk enough, high enough, powerful enough. He pulled on his jacket again, the emperor’s crown unbreakable on his head, and walked out into the night.

1pinoy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1pinoy1/got_catcalled_inside_the_union/,Got catcalled inside the Union,"Today at 5:30 pm, I was walking around inside the union after grabbing coffee from Starbucks. A guy suddenly started walking behind me near the Illini union A, B, C rooms and starting saying some weird stuff. Initially, I thought that maybe he is talking to somebody on the phone. But he kept following me, raised his voice and kept repeating the phrase 'Okay girl', each time louder than the last. I glanced at him and he stared directly at me.

I had the brainwave to immediately walk to the crowded Starbucks area and called up my boyfriend to tell him everything. The guy followed me into Starbucks and kept staring at me. It was so unsettling omg. Then I stood there talking to my boyfriend and after 5 minutes, he walked towards the area where the Starbucks employees keep the coffees. He probably said something to the employees there and did not get any response. He jumped for no reason and then slowly left using the front doors. I was frozen and was extremely scared to step out of the crowded area. This guy was clearly not normal and a creep. Finally, I walked out using a different exit, praying that he isn't waiting somewhere in silence, because I needed to walk back home.

I am thankful for the crowds today, but it is infuriating that at 5:30 pm INSIDE campus, there are people like this. In those moments, I was completely terrified and wondering what would happen if he just decided to keep stalking me or worse. 

Has this sort of thing happened to anyone else before? What is the best way to prevent such people from being able to do this?",33,1765325179.0,UIUC,11,0.8,False

1pinoeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pinoeh/i_worked_on_a_game_called_hushlands/,I worked on a game called Hushlands,"There are days I wish I had done something to save Jeremy Tillman. It’s been twenty years, and it all started with the beta for Hushlands.  
  
Jeremy Tillman was one year senior, and we used to collaborate frequently, both of us being game designers. Actually, my career began with him, as he was the first person to approach me—back in high school—to help him create graphics and help with sound effects for his small independent game. This was back in the 90s, when shareware titles littered the PC gaming landscape, so it was quite a shock to both of us when a bigger game company signed us up for their newest title in the works: “Gorgon 3D.”  
  
A simple Doom clone running on an inferior engine—nothing special, but thanks to Jeremy’s eye for coding smooth and satisfying controls and my artistic sensibilities, the game became quite an unexpected small success. The company itself never put much faith into the project, but after it proved to be of a much higher quality upon release than expected, they offered us more work.  
  
After a few years, we were making better and bigger games—our team rising in its number of members with every successive title. When the early 2000s hit, we were on top of the world, getting ready to work on the biggest project yet:  
  
Hushlands.  
  
It was a grand CRPG affair set in a surreal fantasy world mixing your usual Tolkien-inspired tropes with my own “original” ideas (that I’ve unashamedly borrowed from esoteric and lesser-known foreign literature that I was consuming huge amounts of back then). The titular Hushlands would need many artists and coders to bring to life, so we’ve set out on a mission to find the best of the best. After assembling a team that would make Id Software in their prime look like a bunch of amateurs, we began to work on the game proper.  
  
Hushlands was taking its time, but the publisher was happy as long as the work progressed forward. After three years of development, we’ve finally completed the first beta version—which was about 70% of the final intended release. Back then, advertising was everything, so the publisher insisted on creating as much hype around the game as possible. Jeremy protested, however, and made sure that no news, or even rumors of the game’s production, would leak out—much to the annoyance of our publisher.  
  
He insisted on keeping the project as secret as possible. No one, not even I, knew why he seemed so paranoid about this. After all, isn't this sort of sneak-peeking a good thing for a game? But he remained unmoved by the publisher’s demands and our suggestions. He grew more and more eccentric and started becoming a different person altogether. To me, this transformation was particularly uncanny, as I knew him for such a long time—the cheerful Jeremy became gradually replaced with a much moodier and grimmer workaholic. He would sleep in his chair in front of the computer—which he never turned off—and became basically buried in tasks the nature or use of which he would never disclose to us.  
  
“Bug fixes and engine adjustments.” – That's all he would ever say to us.  
  
He started to write endless notes to himself at all times, as if his memory started to fail him more and more—his desk becoming covered in square sticky notes, some even layered on top of each other. One day - while I made him coffee - I noticed one particular note that read, “Hurry up!”  
  
Eventually, after a particularly heated phone argument with the publisher, he approached me with a strange glimmer in his eyes, which I took as a sign that he had a brand new idea for something.  
  
“Tell you what…” he started, his voice raspy and shaky. “I’ll… I-I’ll implement s-something that will make these idiots shut up in t-two weeks at the beta version showcase they d-d-demanded so damn much!”  
  
“Jeremy, relax!” I tried to calm him down, as his now-coffee-addicted body shook visibly when he said that sentence. “You are working way too hard on this game; just take a small vacation for a week or so! Me and the guys will complete th-”  
  
“In two weeks!!!” he snarled at me with a ferocity I’d never expect from any of my friends. “You will see,” he added as he closed the door.  
  
For the entire two weeks, he worked entirely confined to his desk, leaving it only to use the toilet. He became so fixed on implementing whatever he deemed so important that nobody could even manage to begin to talk to him. All everyone got back from him was a wave of a hand and a quiet snarl.  
  
The day before that beta showcase, he finally approached me and the team, saying:  
  
“Well! All is ready! These suckers will be blown out of their goddamn socks once they see what I’ve cooked up!”  
  
In his hand, he proudly held the disc with “Hushlands Beta 2.1” written on it. We didn’t even question him at that point; we all knew that he was a very talented programmer—definitely the most talented member of our company—but something about this didn’t seem right at all. Worrying that he might’ve actually gone insane because he took on so much work, I discreetly decided to take the disc to my place and see what this new beta version looked like on my own. I suspected that whatever Jeremy had added might’ve been too “out there” to be shown tomorrow, as he used to tell me in private that his biggest dream would be to create a game that would shock people more than any other. He laughed at games like Harvester—notorious for its violence and dark themes—saying that if he had the time and opportunity, he would “make Harvester look like an educational game for toddlers in comparison.”  
  
Having that in mind, I suspected his worsening mental state could make him put some edgy, graphic, or even sexual stuff into the game without my knowledge—thus jeopardizing our beta presentation, which would lead to the game losing its publisher—and that would be a big blow to our team.  
  
While driving back to my home—which was near our office—I glanced at the CD sitting in its case. I was more and more curious as to what I would see once I booted it up on my computer. As I closed the front door behind me and fired up the PC, I sighed, remembering all our previous projects. Gorgon 3D and its crude title screen drawn by me on my own Amiga 500 flashed before my eyes—the memory of quieter and more humble times. I shook my head, regaining composure, and put the disc into the tray. The folder with the game popped up—HSHLNDS\_B\_2.1.EXE staring right back at me from my monitor. Besides the usual game files and some leftover concept art for reference, there was also a text file. Boldly titled ""!!!READMEEEEEE.txt"".



I opened it without much thought. “Probably a list of to-do stuff from Jeremy.” I thought. But I was not ready for what I’ve stumbled upon. The text file was massive—at least 10,000 words long. As I read it, much to my shock, it turned out to be Jeremy’s manifesto of sorts. He described his career leading up to Hushlands and his collaboration with me. He described me as a “good, but sentimental friend.” I didn’t know whether this was a compliment or not, but I read further.

“Hushlands is the opportunity that I’ve waited for. The technological progress of the past few years provided me with the ability to finally create something that I was dreaming of creating since my teens. I am proud of the work I did on this game. I’m sure anyone who plays the game will feel a new kind of emotion. Not fear nor excitement—something beyond that.”

His ramblings became angrier as the text evolved into downright schizophrenic ramblings near the end. All the while, it seemed to me that he took the entire credit for the game—this made me feel angry and annoyed at him. I decided to confront him with this tomorrow before our presentation. I couldn’t let him get away with disrespecting me and the other members of our team.

“We’ve all worked our asses off, and that’s how he behaves now?” I mumbled to myself as I closed the text out of anger.

I took a sip of beer and opened the .EXE file, bracing myself for whatever awaited me.

The title screen, along with the theme song, played as planned—the detailed Hushlands logo appeared along with the main menu. Instead of the “New Game” option, there was “PRESENTATION START” written in a standard system font.

“He didn’t even change the font?” I sighed. “Jeremy, what the hell did you do during these two weeks?”

I clicked the presentation option and waited as the game loaded. The black screen featured only the main character of the game—an elf protagonist named Sylva. His animation, voice acting, and other essential elements were fully completed, but for some inexplicable reason, Jeremy replaced his voice. Gone was the professional voice work we focused so much on—he now sounded like a mess of low-quality stock voices jumbled together.

“Fucking hell!” I angrily sneered. “How the fuck does he expect this to impress our publisher?”

I was just about to call Jeremy, demanding him to explain this mess, when the character started moving on its own. I watched as Sylva walked about in the total darkness until a green glow appeared. This turned out to be a portal that transported him into the Prilma Dungeon—one of the locations we’ve planned to create but decided to cut out of the project due to its huge size. But here I saw a finished, high-quality location filled with detail, careful texturing, and magnificent lighting effects!

“Oh my God.” I whispered. “Jeremy, did you do this all by yourself?”

Sylva was now standing still. I started to control him to explore the dungeon. I was floored, as this looked at least ten times better than anything we'd created up to that point. Hell, not even the biggest AAA games of that year could compare. If this was shown to the publisher, they would truly be amazed! But, that strange voice replacement. Why?

As I started wondering about this bizarre decision, Sylva spoke. I recognized the line from one of the hundreds of stock voice & FX CDs we would use. It was your usual “old wizard” voice.

“It seems my spell worked well!”

I puzzled over the meaning of this. What spell?

As I moved Sylva across the dungeon, I marveled further at Jeremy’s achievement. Along the way, some enemies appeared, but Sylva took them out no problem. The animations and combat worked perfectly, so I started to relax a little. Aside from the missing voice, we didn’t have to worry about disappointing the publisher! I leaned back in my chair and took a sip of beer. I grabbed my phone and wanted to call Jeremy, but then I thought of how angry he would be with me if he found out that I'd sneaked the CD out of our studio. Also, I started to remember the bizarre manifesto of his and wondered what its true meaning was.

I then realized how impossible it was for one man to do all this work by himself and in just two weeks. There was just no way he could do it without at least a dozen other artists and coders working 24/7, and even then I’m not sure if the result would be so… polished? Spectacular? There really was no way to describe it. That’s when I started to feel fear—fear of something being fundamentally wrong. I finally understood its source—I was staring at something that had no right to exist. The level kept on going, showing no sign of any bugs or any deficiency—it was just too perfect to be a single human’s creation.

That’s when my phone rang. It made me jump, as my entire focus was on the game. I answered it, expecting to hear from Jeremy. Sure enough, it was him—his calm voice sent shivers down my spine.

“So? How’d you like it?”

I couldn’t speak—my jaw hung from its hinges from shock as my eyes darted around my room, the feeling of being watched just too strong to ignore.

“J-Jeremy?” I struggled to respond. “How… How do you-”

“It’s simple,” he responded—again, the unnatural calm in his voice petrifying me. “When involving yourself in something so important, a single human can do wonders. Especially when he’s got help.”

“From whom?” I asked, my face wet from cold sweat.

He laughed a cold and ruthless chuckle that might as well have come from the devil himself.

“Oh, you know,” he responded as I struggled to regain composure, grabbing the can of beer I'd been drinking from in the process.

“Ooh… Told ‘ya before that beer does not help with artistic endeavors, didn't I?”

The can fell to the ground as I froze in place, Jeremy Tillman’s laugh still ringing in my ears.

“H-how do you…?” I choked out an answer.

I quickly rose from my seat, ran up to the window, and looked outside—hoping that this was just a cruel prank to get back at me for snatching the beta CD.

“No, no, no!” he chuckled. “I ain’t there!”

I started frantically searching through my closets, other rooms of the home, and even under the tables—sure enough, I was all alone with no way of anyone knowing what I was doing.

""Don't bother looking under the bed. You are a big boy and don’t believe in monsters, right?"" he laughed mockingly.

Jeremy mockingly commented on my every move. Finally, I grabbed a book from my shelf and opened it on a random page.

“Ooh! Grave’s “Greek Myths”! The Argo’s journey was my personal favorite!”

I looked at my copy of Robert Graves's Greek Myths, opened to the chapter discussing the myth of the Argonauts and their quest for the golden fleece.

“I still remember how we would look through this book for inspiration when creating Gorgon 3D. Good times, huh?”

I screamed and threw the book away. Jeremy’s voice being too much to bear, I turned off the phone and returned to my desk, only to find a horrific picture displayed on my PC monitor. It was a close-up of Sylva’s face—pixelated and mangled. His eyes were nowhere to be seen—replaced by deep, dark, gaping holes. I tried to close the game, but the entire PC froze on that image, the GPU and hard drive making as much noise as possible. Speakers were filled with static as I moved the mouse and worked the keyboard to no use. Having no other way to get rid of this nightmare, I grabbed the power cable and yanked it out of the socket, putting an end to this nightmare.

My ride back to the office was frantic and dangerous, my head reverberating with thoughts that defied rationality. I opened the door and entered the dimly-lit office at 1 AM, expecting to see no one. But Jeremy waited for me. Sitting in his chair - as always in front of his computer—dead, with an empty, emotionless expression on his pale and cold face. I cried as my shaky hands called for an ambulance, but it was too late. They declared him deceased on the spot. Cause of death? Nobody could figure that out. Police investigated but found no traces of foul play. It wasn’t a suicide—that was their only certainty.

His PC was on when I found him—the screen displaying the game’s unfinished code. The sound of the computer’s cooling fans and the hard drive reminded me of human breathing - no one else noticed it as I turned the PC off, before giving it over to the authorities for forensic analysis. They found nothing that they could tie to his death and closed the case soon after, deciding that Jeremy died from “work exhaustion.”

Hushlands wasn’t canceled. The project was renamed with a different title that came out to much critical reception and big sales. I don’t want to tell you what the title of that game is. All I can say is that it’s a CRPG with a top-down perspective. I, and the rest of the team, had to work over Jeremy’s work—a strange mix of guilt and fear that I do not wish upon anyone. The knowledge that some of Jeremy’s assets that materialized during those two weeks remained in the final product haunts me to this day.

It was decided that Jeremy Tillman’s name was to be removed from the credits.

Back to that manifesto and beta disc. Once I made sure that my PC was working fine after rebooting, I ejected it, broke the goddamn thing in half, and threw it away. Anticlimactic, I know. Before doing that, however, I backed up the text file—if there were any answers to this entire madness, I was sure to find them there. I mustered up the courage to read Jeremy’s manifesto in detail, finding strange names, chaos magick and Neoplatonism. The name of Engelbrecht of Bonn came up quite a bit in the latter sections. I did some digging later and found this description of him and his teachings:

From “The Early Magicians of the Renaissance” (1872) by Dr. Klemens Ignacy Górski—chapter 12, pgs. 120-121:

*“Meister Engelbrecht von Bonn was known to be one especially talented magician that utilized the teachings of Cornellius Agrippa and other contemporary theoreticians to much practical success - invoking, among many others, angels, demons, lesser deities of various celestial bodies, guardian spirits of towns, deities of elementa principalia, and the artes liberales. In one particular case, he succeeded in creating a dazzling fresco at the town hall of Kalisz, Poland. What would’ve taken a dozen artisans to complete in a month, he managed to execute in a mere week, much to the town authorities’ and local clergy’s astonishment. Also, around that time, he surprised Barnim XI, the Duke of Pomerania, by painting on canvas an uncanny face in such a convincing way that, upon observing it closely, one would swear that its eyes could follow their movements. Some claimed, that the face’s eyes would even turn into deep, dark wells at Engelbrecht’s will, much to the terror of spectators.”*

I thought I slept wrong so I just took 2 ibuprofen and started walking to class. I noticed that breathing deep hurt a lot, and I had to because it was cold out, i was in a hurry, and my backpack is heavy. I couldnt wait to sit down and put my bag down. I just couldnt get the pain to go away. I work at an on-campus coffee shop and we are constantly busy. I had to lean over the counter about halfway through my shift so I didnt vomit. My back was screaming at me and so was my upper stomach. Since then, the pain hasn't gone away. It dulls out and then I feel a stabbing pain and it comes back. 

I realize that this could be referred pain, and we learned about it a lot in my physiology class. I feel pain underneath my sternum more right shifted, though. On my back, the pain is underneath my right scapula, but towards the middle of my back. It subsided when I laid flat on my back but came back quickly when I sat up. 

Yes, I have lost a lot of weight recently, but I am on weight loss medication, so I do not know if that has been affected at all. 
I was nauseous during work and then on my walk back to my dorm. I am not as nauseous now.
I woke up at 6:30 this morning and it is now 7pm and the pain has not gone away.
I told my parents about it and my dad got mad at me and guilt tripped me into not going to the doctor. 

I guess I don't really know what it is or how serious it is. I could be just dramatic and it'll go away on it's own, but I worry. This hasn't happened before. ",1,1765324934.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1pini14,https://v.redd.it/js6aki6no96g1,Why did my extraction get much faster after switching to a bottomless portafilter? Is this normal? [Sage Barista Express],"Hi guys,

I’ve been pulling shots on my Sage Barista Express using the stock portafilter and the non-pressurized double basket. With that setup, I was consistently getting 35 g out with the dose-in 20.2g in about 28 seconds, and the taste was nice overall. For flat whites it was good, but I always felt like the body was just slightly missing something; not bad, just a bit lighter than expected. Whenever I tried increasing the dose or going finer with the stock basket, the machine would start choking, so I couldn’t really push it further.

Recently I switched to a bottomless portafilter with a new basket, and I also started using a puck screen. I kept all my settings exactly the same (grind size 2, inner burr 4), but the extraction suddenly became way faster around 17 seconds for 35 g out. Prep should be fine (WDT, leveler, tamp), so I don’t think it’s a distribution issue. I’ve read that switching to a bottomless often speeds up flow because the baskets are different, and many people say you normally need to grind finer afterward. I’m wondering if what I’m experiencing is completely normal.

One detail I noticed:
The original Sage BE basket slightly narrows toward the bottom, but the new basket does not narrow at all. Because of that, with the same dose and grind, it looks like there’s more headspace above the coffee in the new basket. That might be contributing to the faster flow, but I’m not 100% sure if that’s expected.

My beans are a Peru washed, roasted one month ago.

So here’s my question:
With the new bottomless + new basket + puck screen, should I simply grind finer, or should I also increase the dose?
And since I used to get choking when going finer on the stock basket, could this new basket actually help me finally get that extra bit of body I’ve been missing?

I also recorded a video of the shot if that helps diagnose what’s happening.

1pine77,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1pine77/review_of_apple_ipad_renewed_102inch_wifi_32gb/,"Review of Apple iPad (Renewed), 10.2-Inch, Wi-Fi, 32GB, Space Gray","The listing screams ""bargain bin Apple"" with a single product photo and a price tag that barely covers dinner for two. At $108, this renewed iPad 7 sits in that awkward zone where it's cheaper than a new Android tablet but more expensive than a decent Chromebook. The 15,100 reviews and 4.2-star rating suggest people are buying it, but the real story lives in those review details.

Someone found dirt under their screen two months later - not on it, under it. Another buyer has a mysterious blue spot that ""you can barely see at times."" These aren't deal-breakers for $108, but they paint a clear picture of what ""renewed"" actually means here. You're not getting a pristine Apple product; you're getting someone else's daily driver that got wiped down and shrink-wrapped.

The specs tell their own story. 32GB storage in 2024 is basically a cruel joke - that's about 10 minutes of 4K video or three modern games. The Lightning connector means you're still living in cable hell, and that 10.2-inch screen is perfectly adequate for doom-scrolling but cramped for anything productive. Yet this thing has a headphone jack, which suddenly feels like a luxury feature.

Here's where this makes sense: you're buying a tablet for your kid who will drop it within a week. Or maybe you need a dedicated kitchen screen for recipes that can survive spaghetti sauce fingerprints. It's also perfect as that ""guest iPad"" that lives in the living room drawer - functional enough for visitors to check email, cheap enough that you won't cry when they spill coffee on it.

The math works if you view this as a disposable Apple experience rather than a long-term investment. At $108, you're paying about $36 per year if it lasts three years, which is less than Netflix. Just temper expectations - this isn't your primary device, it's the one you hand to toddlers or use as a glorified Spotify controller. If that's your use case, the gamble might actually pay off.

So me personally, I’m hoping to avoid the religious overtones.  Well, unless the book is really good otherwise. Then I guess I can just ignore that stuff.

Surely someone has made a book something like this?

But the truth hits hard once you dig into what real waterfront ownership in White Rock and South Surrey actually involves.

Here is the real story buyers usually learn too late.

• True waterfront is insanely scarce and heavily regulated  
• Storm surges and insurance challenges can destroy your budget  
• Crescent Beach and Marine Drive zoning rules shift what you can build or renovate  
• Bluff erosion in Ocean Park is real and expensive to manage  
• Premium prices are driven by scarcity and that coastal lifestyle you cannot fake  
• High risk and high reward, with long term maintenance shaped by weather and terrain

Movva peered curiously through the door to her ship’s guest room. It was a cabin like any other, with light-grey metal walls, a bed, a window, a little kitchen area, a bathroom… The necessities. But since this was a guest room, it was also slightly nicer than the ones the crew usually got; it had a rug! It also had a lone Tobby unpacking his overpacked luggage. There was one very VERY important question that inquiring minds wished to know..and she was going to ask it “Soooooo… you two totally fucked, right?”

*‘Mrrp!?’* He expectantly made a startled trill and stopped mid-pulling out a shirt to snap his head towards her. “Who starts a conversation like that!?”

Movva quickly slipped into the room and closed the door behind her. “Mmmmme~” she answered with her back to the door frame, and her tongue poking out a little. To borrow one of the many human adages she’d picked up on the job, the pink ambassador wanted *ALL! THAT! TEA!!* Tobby was her favorite virgin after all, briefly her second favorite thanks to Jek, but she’d already remedied that. She was as invested in team Tobby as the average human was in their local football team. Zero wins and going strong! Airhorns galore! “C’mooon, there’s no way she wasn’t all over you after showing her the *duality of Tobreal Centorni~*”

“I don't have a duality,” Tobby grumbled, pulling the rest of his tightly folded clothes out onto the bedspread. “And NO! Nothing like that happened.”

Movva squinted, scanning Tobby for one of his countless tells to see if he was lying, and... nothing. “Boo,” she pouted, folding her arms, and her ears lying sideways in disappointment. “Is she just an ungrateful prude or-” 

She paused when Tobby stopped unpacking again to glare at her wordlessly. *Kitten was not happy with that dialog tree. Let's try something else.*

Time to do what she did best, after sex… and violence… And a few other things. Flop on the nearest couch and lazily probe into Tobby’s private life! Put that one psychology class she took to work! Real ambassador stuff! 

The guest room also had a pair of small couches around a coffee table she’d bought off a human smuggler, made with real cloned Mahogany~. She easily wrote those off as a business expense because it really ‘set the atmosphere’ for wining and dining political guests. Fumpf! She flopped, ready to get down to business as she put on that casual air. “So you're telling me… You got her, Mrs Kitta’s ***priceless*** pre-contact astro-emerald dress.”

Tobby kept unpacking but nodded. Packing his mom clearly did for him, ‘cause there were more spare clothes than colors on Xoso’s rainbow-striped dick! “Yep.”

“Resized it for her, meaning you got some paws-on measurements.” She counted off on a second claw.

“Mmmhmm..”

“Bodyguarded her at an international crime convention.”

“Pretty much...”

“Let her steal your food **and** got her more when you ran out.”

“You stole my imitation crab, too…” He mumbled, finally getting to pulling out his pants.

“Got her on the dancefloor and tangoed with her so close your whiskers could get tangled.”

“I have no idea what ‘tango’ means…” He commented, pulling out a human sub-machine gun of some sort from the bag, inspecting it, and laying it on the bed next to his clothes

“You taunted her into leading, and when she did, she was ALL up on you with ‘fuck me’ eyes.”

“Pretty sure she was just mad because I wouldn't stop goading her.”

“That’s ‘cause you’re a sub Tobby…”

*“Mrrp!?”* he trilled, tensing like he was accused of something.

“At least until what's his face crashed that **super** intense moment you were having and totally tongue-blocked the lick your nose was about to get. At which point the switch justifiably flipped, and dark-side Tobby came out swinging.”

“She wasn’t going to lick me, she was just mad… And excited… And please don't say ‘dark side’ like I’m a Star-Claws character.”

“Tobby.” She stated flatly, lying on her side and propping her head up in her hand. “You went from nervous bean to psychotic organ harvester the instant he threatened her.”

“He was going to swing on her, Pinky!” He said defensively, turning to face Movva. “My only job at this event was to keep her away from him. And I'm pretty sure at this point he was setting up to frame her as the attacker!”

Movva continued counting off on her fingers. “You also threatened his life right to his father’s face. Which is why you’re sleeping on my ship for the rest of the Sabu-kai.”

“I... may have gone a little too far there,” he shrank.

“Not far enough, given how hot n’ bothered she seemed by angry Tobby.” She nodded self-assuredly. “Never before had my hopes that you’d finally get some been higher than when I saw her checking you out as you threatened that guy.”

“She was not!” It was starting to smell like denial up in here.

“Oh, correction! Never before were my hopes higher than that moment, until you texted me about the surprise trunk of ice cream you ordered for her.”

“The ice cream wasn’t that big a deal, I told her Mom taught me how to dance with dairy-based bribery. And I meant it. How could I look her in the eyes, having not followed through on that?”

“Like you're doing me… right now… like you're sorry for somehow not rescuing someone's pet spood from a tree fast enough.”

“But…” He had a finger raised like he wanted to make a point, but faltered.

“BUT, you’re telling me that after ALL that, with only a single bed in your hotel room serving one of the greatest porn plot scenarios ever written, she DIDN'T give tiger his first cave?”

There was a long pause from Tobby before he uttered a definitive “... Yes. We shared the bed in shifts since she has a different sleep schedule than I.”

Movva gave him a long, slow blink as she lay there on the couch. “One moment.” She said calmly, before turning her head, burying her face into a decorative couch pillow, and screaming. 

T’was the muffled scream of the entire Team-Tobby fanbase having witnessed Tobby somehow reach the grand championships without a single win under his belt. He had the ball within 3 inches of the goal/touchdown/whatever and not a single opponent in his way. But at the last fucking moment, the ref threw a flag, the timer ran out, and there were parking tickets/divorce papers on all their cars…

“Pinky...?” She heard Tobby call out meekly, sounding worried.

This had to be a sick joke. The stars had fucking aligned for spirits' sake, and NOTHING?! Sure was glad he wasn't pants’ pissing afraid of night-kin anymore, but that only made the lack of any cosmic payoff even worse! Then a thought struck Movva… like a bell. Her head sprang up from the pillow. “I’m gonna kick her ass.”

“Wh-what?” Tobby stammered, confused.

She sat up the rest of the way, scowling. “I’m gonna kick her ass!”

“WHAT!? Nonononononoo!” He dashed over to try and physically stop her, but it was too late. He may be a bit stronger than she remembered, but it paled in comparison to the strength of Pinky’s divine justice! 

She didn't care how comical Tobby being dragged along the metal floor looked as he clung to her ankles. She was taking one powerful step at a time towards the other guest room where the OFFENDER now resided. Any of her crew who entered the hallway and saw the scene may have giggled or laughed at first, but as soon as they saw the state the captain/ambassador was in, they promptly fled. “Going.. To!.. Kick!.. Her!.. Ass!!” She threatened between huffs. 

This had to be HER fault. Movva refused to believe Tobby had so little game as to fuck up the perfect romantic storm! Soapy had to be manipulating him; you don’t get everything Tobby did for her, react as positively as she did, and NOT pay out at the grand finale unless you were just using him!

—

*Meanwhile… 12 hours earlier…*

Cue Tobby and Soapy sitting cross-legged on the bed in a pair of those plush hotel bathrobes, surrounded by empty ice cream containers, and watching yee-olde massive TV. The door was blocked with a decorative dresser and a flower pot precariously balanced on the ledge in case anyone tried to break in. The balcony curtains were drawn in case of snipers, and the TV was on the second greatest show ever conceived. ‘Kingdom of The Spoods’

Originally intended for kittens, it quickly evolved into a full-blown historical docu-drama series for adults when they realized just how much sex, drugs, and violence history actually contained. The premise was simple: Use the spood’s capacity for mimicry to make them re-enact historical events in miniature while a narrator describes the events. Splash in some cut-aways to Zarmian archeology sites, museums, and ‘experts,’ and you get something that contends with bap-tal season finals for second most popular show on Salafor.

“We so aren't doing everyone's wild assumptions any favors, are we?” Soapy commented, dipping her yay big spoon into the ‘chocolate trinity’ tub she had between her legs. Her eyes still focused on a toga-wearing spood gesticulating before a little stone podium, making an impassioned speech when it suddenly caught an arrow through one of its many tendril legs. **[No spoods were harmed in the making of this documentary]** briefly flashed in the corner of the screen as the spood crowd began to squeal and panic.

“What do you mean?” Tobby asked, giving the TV the same almost expressionless stare as he used a claw to cut a seam along yet another cone’s paper wrapping.

“Your friend totally thinks we’re fucking right now…”

There was a pregnant pause from Tobby, but his gaze upon the show never faltered as he peeled the paper away. He watched as several spoods rushed the stage with little bronze spears, stabbing the speaker repeatedly, colorful blood spewing everywhere. **[No spoods were harmed in the making of this documentary]** flashed in the corner again. “She wishes.”

—

*Back in the present!*	

“I’m gonna destroy her fucking bloodline!” Movva seethed as they got closer and closer to the guestroom door.

“What part of ‘it's not like that’ are you incapable of grasping!?” Tobby protested from the floor, still clinging to her paws in an effort to delay his *‘totally-not-girlfriend’s’* inevitable demise!

“The part where it doesn’t look like she’s abusing your innocent bean nature to get nice things!” Movva growled, taking another step. She’d pay!! She will suffer at the claws of **Pinky-**

“I invoke clause 13a!”

Movva stopped in her tracks and glared at the guestroom door ahead, so close yet so far. “You wouldn’t dare…” He wouldn’t! He couldn’t! Didn’t he see she was trying to help him here!?

“I Do! I, Tobreal Centorni, invoke clause 13a under addendum 2 of the mutually assured destruction pact. Mandatory compromise!”

Gods fucking damn iiiit!! She knew she should have read his half of the addendum all those years ago, but freshman Pinky just wanted him off her tail about beating up people who, *in her correct opinion*, deserved it!

Clause 13a: Mandatory compromise, as the name implies, dictates that either party can, under dire circumstances, force the other to the negotiating table. It was, in reality, a mandatory quid pro quo that was most frequently used when Tobby really didn't want Movva to do something rash. Neither party completely got what they wanted, but a compromise or trade was always reached.

Movva had to put her murder march on pause, sigh in crippling disappointment, and turn toward the still downed Tobby with her hands on her hips. “Fine. My minimum terms are that I fight her.”

Tobby, getting up from the ground and dusting himself off, glowered. “I figured as much. My demands are that the fight is non-lethal and results in no long-term bodily injury. She needs to be **presentable** at the Sabu-Kai. That means no claws, no broken bones, nothing that would have Whiskers questioning me about what happened.”

Were his demands reasonable given the circumstances… yes. He’d already pissed off two syndicate bosses yesterday, he didn't need a third. Was she going to openly admit that? Hell no! “C’mon! That's like… 90% of my move set!” She protested, raising a hand with her claws extended.

Tobby looked none too impressed. “Uh-huh, and just who do you think you’re lying to? Everyone knows you prefer blunt trauma over using your claws. Less evidence, more muscle advantage.”

“Fffffineeee!!” She accepted, slumping and throwing her head back dramatically. Though she paused the display to quickly look back down at him. “What do I get?”

“Tobby pinched the bridge of his muzzle and groaned a little, foreseeing her price tag, before he begrudgingly asked, “What do you want?”

She could always shake Tobby down for more additions to her growing human weapons collection… or… *or…* ***OR!!*** An idea struck the ambassador, an evil idea that surely would drown her in the blood river, but soooo worth it nonetheless. “You remember those cute shorts I got you?” She asked, watching Tobby go from orange to pale. “The ones you thought I wouldn't notice you leaving behind in your apartment?” She grinned with the vilest of intentions.

—

*Meanwhile!*

“You should probably know… Someone’s found himself a little girlfriend.” Nenda said conspiratorially, contributing to the bi-weekly salon tea spilling as she worked on one of her shareholders’ manes.

“Let me guess,” Veylana said with a hint of resignation as she scrolled down through the day's news-posts on her assistant. “Night-kin? Impish tomboy destined for lower back pain?”

She heard a pause from Nenda, but she continued combing and trimming. “Yes… Whisker’s latest stray. You already know of her?”

“I had my suspicions,” She sighed in resignation, looking up from her assistant, as those suspicions were confirmed. “What did he do?”

To her left, Suzzid snickered devilishly as she filed Veylana’s off-hand claws. “What didn’t little sha do?”

To Veylana’s right, Ghrette fingered through a small box of financial documents. “Little sha dropped a pretty grand to do them up for a trip to Nyathers, and more importantly, not to tell you,” she sighed amusedly as she pulled out five separate receipts and offered them up to Veylana.

“And you're breaking that agreement because…?” She asked, setting her assistant on the arm of the salon chair so she could take the receipts.

“Because you and Whiskers keep our lights on in this ever-persistent economic downturn,” Nanda said, side-stepping back into Veylana’s view with a faint smile and scissors twirling on a claw. “Plus, he bribed me not to tell you he was here; he said nothing about telling you we saw a pretty shi with him. Nor did he pay a single credit to keep any of the other girls quiet, which is why Ghrette was the one who said it.”

*‘Whatever keeps their consciences clear…’* Veylana thought as she skimmed over the receipts. A sum total of a thousand credits broken unevenly among five nameless customers who didn’t exist. Each visited at night, paid via cred-stick, and while no receipt had a listed phenotype, he’d taken the extra step to have all of the late-light visitors have ‘aurabelle oils’ incorporated into their treatments. If the times listed weren't enough to make an everyday guard assume ‘night kin’, the oils were. “And this was all his idea? Did she tell him how to do any of this, or did you cover for him?”

Ghrette still fingered through the box, idly flipping through more receipts as she compiled the week's money washing efforts. “Little sha was surprisingly thorough with how he wanted his tracks covered. His *‘murder mittens’* didn’t tell him a thing~” the kin-less tittered, clearly finding the nickname adorable.

Veylana already felt exasperation coming on before thinking aloud, “Cute, he already has an ironic little pet name for her…” Last time she’d heard ‘murder mittens’ was when Tobby was having his feisty toddler phase. He’d always get super upset whenever she pried him from his documentaries to get his fur done. Nanda was new at the time and got the idea to make him believe there was a whole world of secret code phrases that salon workers used to describe clients as ‘targets’ and their work as ‘missions’. He got absolutely enthralled by the notion, and wanted in on it so badly he actually started begging to go. It was adorable… And now her son was using one of those little code-phrases as a nickname for the driver who’s been picking him up for ‘work’. It’s worse than she thought. 

And out came the slow exhale/sigh through her nose, remembering how her husband started calling her ‘sugar claws’ the first time she tried cooking for him. Sadly, this news also meant she had to get her genuine apology voice ready. Poor Shella…

She looked over to the door she last saw Shella dip into. “Shella, dear! You there?”


“Yes, Mrs Centorni?” The sun-kin shi called back from the other room.

“Hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it seems we're going to have to put the temple meet-up on hold for the foreseeable future. Can’t be helped, sweetie.”

3… 2… 1… “Gahds damn itt!!” Shella swore from a distant part of the salon, that open-plains twang coming out harder than whatever she threw to cause the metal clatter that came after. Poor girl tried so hard to suppress ‘sounding like a grass-farming hick’ around Tobreal, yet never seemed to realize the accent gave her a rural uniqueness that most sun-kin lacked. This likely wasn’t good for her self-confidence.

She’d make Shella an apology pie or something later, something slow, savory, and feel-good. That out of the way, she turned her attention back to the salon shi at hand. “I want details. Now,” she ordered.

Buni, loveable airhead that she is, was in another of her hyper-focused states, sharpening blades one booth over. Which meant she was at her bluntest. “It’s as they said, he did it all on his own.” She said, looking down the edge of a long razor blade. “But he did naively assume bribing Nenda meant bribing everyone on staff that evening. He did everything but stick the landing.”

*‘Well, at least he figured out the basics on his own.’* Veylana thought. She’d be upset that Tobreal was hiding things from her if not for just how bad he was at it… or the subject matter. She could forgive him for hiding his involvement with Whiskers, assuming he still believed all her funds came from investments made with his father’s life insurance money, but hiding that he actually met someone special? *Unforgivable.*

“And the shi…?” She led.

“Soaphine ‘Soapy’ Wiskito. Whiskers' current adoptee/driver, amateur bap-tal fighter, and seemingly unwitting recipient of Tobreal’s affections. He can’t keep his ears off her, constantly checking if she’s present as if she had the power to vanish. He appears unafraid of her despite his phobia of night-kin.” She said clinically, taking the next blade to the whetstone. “Money was no object when it came to ‘making her feel pretty’, yet he seems blissfully unaware that she’s already pretty. He was genuinely surprised when we pointed out her generous ‘blessing’ from Xoso too.”

Suzzid looked up from the claws she was sharpening, brow raised, “*You’re* the one who pointed it out.”

“He’s tripping over his own ears,” Nenda finished for her with a shrug, “even more so than the Lihlel incident, except this time the shi he likes isn't a spoiled bitch. They seem to be in the will-they/won't-they ‘in-denial’ phase of classic ‘co-worker mingling’, and I am here for it~ Sound familiar?” She smiled.

It did sound familiar… very familiar. Tobby is so much like his father it hurts… a tall, timid, romantic who was more blissfully unaware of his own feelings than she thought was possible. She missed that sha… even now, he made her question if Tobby inherited anything from her but her fur. Every time she looked at him, it was like an echo of her husband was standing right behind her, hand on her shoulder, keeping the ever-present melancholy at bay.

*‘We made that.’*

She should go; her mane was done anyway. “Very well, thank you for bringing this to my attention…”

“Going already?” Nenda questioned when Veylana started getting up from her seat, and the other shi pulled back from their work.

“Yes, unfortunately. I have some cooking to do if Shella’s going to feel better about her chances with Tobreal before the day is over.”

1pimzne,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1pimzne/theres_something_under_the_boardwalk_part_ii/,There’s Something Under the Boardwalk - Part II,"I jumped back. I pushed myself off the loose board, propping myself up against the concrete. The wood must have knocked whatever it was off the wall. I turned my eyes back to the mass only to find it was gone, leaving only a trail of faint fluid in one direction; under the boardwalk. Then, only silence. The sound of my rapidly racing heart was all that was left. What the hell was that? Did it really blink at me? I had to have been seeing things, I just had to. If that was a dead nest, why wasn't it thin and papery? The more I thought of its texture, the more I started to feel nauseous. If there were ever a time I needed a drink, this was it.

I began walking in a daze, listlessly on auto pilot. Only the buzzing sign above guided me to my destination, like a moth to a flame. I pushed the bar doors open to find an empty cavern. Only the sound of the reverberating juke box rang about the building. ""Hello, It's Me"", Todd Rungren, the ghosts around here had good taste. The dim lighting hid the architectural bones of the building. In typical Paradise Point tradition, this was yet another aging wonder. On quiet nights like this one, you might hear the remnants of good times past. Sometimes, it even felt like the seat next to mine was taken, even if nobody was there. For now, it was just me and my echoing footsteps.

I hadn't sat for more than what felt like a few seconds before Tommy asked me for my drink. I snapped out of it, ""What's that?"".

""Your drink, Mac. What would you like to drink?"" he said, gesturing in a chugging motion.

""Oh, um, just grab me a shot of the usual, please.""

With that, he made his way to the far end cooler. Blackberry brandy, a local delicacy. Never had it before I moved down here, but it quickly became my drink of choice. If your local watering hole doesn't keep a bottle or two in their frostiest cooler, don't bother. A warm shot of this might as well be a felony.

Tommy poured a heavy hand into the glass in front me, ""It's on me, buddy."" He poured another for himself and we clinked our glasses. 

""You alright, man? You look like you've seen a ghost.""

That nauseous rot in my stomach returned. The hum of the lights above me seemed to grow louder in sync with my thudding heart. How would I even have begun to explain what I had just seen? Before I could formulate a lie, he had to greet a new bar patron. My eyes followed suit to find that it was a familiar face. There she was, the girl I had just seen at Vincent's.

""Do you come here often?"" she said with a faux twang accent, pulling up in the vacated seat next to me. 

""I-uh... reckon."" I said coyly, channeling my inner John Wayne.

""Looks like we have the place all to ourselves,"" she remarked with a grin.

""Tommy better not leave the register unattended, there must be a whole 50$ in there."" I quipped. 

She laughed. ""Perfect, just the right amount to start a new life with.""

She presented her mixed drink to me for a cheers, only for me to realize my shot was empty. Suddenly, as if telepathically summoned, Tommy was there pouring into my glass mid air. Talk about top notch service.

 ""Here's to..."" I trailed off.

""Here's to another summer in the books,"" she declared.

I nodded my head and followed through with my second dose of medicine.

She then continued, ""So are you local year round?""

I shook my head yes and clarified, ""Haven't always been. This is going to be the second winter I stay down here. How about you?""

She then proceeded to explain that she was back in school, her father owned Vincent's and she was only helping on weekends until they closed for the year. She was a nursing major, in the thick of her training to become certified. I listened intently; she seemed like she had a plan. I discovered we were the same age, 23, yet on completely different avenues in life. She was at least on a road, I haven't been on one for miles.

""Enough about me, what are you up to?"" A question I was dreading. I answered very plainly, ""I don't know.""

After a brief silence, I involuntarily laughed. ""I'm just trying to figure somethings out. It's been a very long couple of years.""

I think she could see the fatigue on my face. ""Do you want to talk about it?""

I shook it off. ""Not particularly, it'll pass. Just a matter of time.""

I noticed she must have gone home and changed, she was no longer in her generic east coast Italian pizzeria shirt. She was wearing a faded Rolling Stones shirt under her plaid long sleeve. I saw my opening and quickly changed the subject.

""Hey, I love that shirt. I work over at Spectre's, actually. We have one just like it.""

She looked down and declared. ""That's hilarious, that's where I stole this from!""

We both laughed.

""It wouldn't surprise me,"" I remarked. ""The staff there is terrible, someone needs to be fired.""

Our laughter echoed in the empty bar, only now mixing with the sound of a different song, ""These Eyes"" by The Guess Who. The ghosts never miss. 

She continued, ""The Stones are my dad's favorite band. He named me Angie after the song."" 

I liked that, it fit her.

""My dad loved them too,"" I concurred. ""He took me to see them when I was a kid.""

She smiled. ""Sounds like a great dad to me.""

I averted my gaze and wanted to change the subject. Then it hit me, maybe she'd like the album I took home. I began to reach for my bag only to find that it was missing something; the record.

My eyes went into the distance, suddenly being brought back to the reality that was my night.

""Everything okay?"" she inquired.

""Yeah, I just took an album home tonight and I think I might have left it behind.""

Then a thought chilled me to the bone. Did it fall out of my bag when I fell on the boardwalk? It was a white album, I would've seen it, right? Unless... did it slip between the cracks? My mind raced for a moment before she said, ""Looks like I'm not the only person on the island with the 5-finger discount at Spectre's.""

I snapped out of it and gave a half-hearted chuckle. I looked at my phone, few missed calls, few texts I didn't care to answer. It was getting close to 11; I had definitely stayed longer than my allotted time at Mick's. Besides, I had a girl at home that didn't like to be kept waiting, Daisy, my German shepherd. She was no doubt worried sick where I was.

The thoughts of what I had seen earlier that night began storming upon what was a good mood. I quickly said, ""I have to get going, my dog is home waiting for me and she could probably use a quick walk before bed.""

Angie smiled wide. ""I love dogs! Do you think I could meet her?""

There was a pause. I didn't know if she meant this very moment or in the near future. Either option didn't feel good to me. It was a nice surprise to meet someone who could distract me from my mind this long. What was the endgame here? This girl was probably better off just leaving whatever this was between us right here at Mick's.

""I'm sure you'll see her. I walk her a lot around here, maybe if she's good I'll grab a slice for her this weekend.""

That was the best I could do. It was better than ""Run as fast as you can.""

""Do you need me to walk you home?""

She responded, ""I'm meeting some of my friends at The Pointe, I was going to call an Uber. It's their last weekend of work here, so they want to celebrate.""

Tommy, beginning to close up for the night, spoke up. ""I can wait here with her, I'm still cleaning up. I'll see you tomorrow night.""

With what I was going to do next on my mind, I began to make my way to exit. Just as I was opening the doors, she shouted, ""You never told me your name!""

Without turning around, or even thinking, I responded, ""It doesn't really matter.""

What the hell did I mean by that?

Just as I opened the bar doors, I was greeted by a misty air. The air had taken a new quality, this one was thick. Given the frequent temperature fluctuations this time of year, it was no surprise that a storm was on the way.

I looked down the corridor of street lights that resided on Atlantic Ave. Blinking yellow lights, an offseason signature, and the only illuminating sight on this foggy night. There was a slight rumble in the sky.

As I made my way, my footsteps on the sidewalk echoed into eternity. Each step making me less sure of what I was doing. I made it to the foot of the slope, my shadow growing larger with each step. I peered out to the loose board I had become acquainted with. The fog had passed just long enough for me to see that there was nothing there, just bare naked concrete.

I had felt like a child, frightfully staring down a dark hallway after hearing a bump in the night. I scanned the area, no sight of the album. It was around this time that I noticed it was a full moon. With a storm approaching, that combination would definitely spell for a high tide. If the record was down there, it would be gone by morning. I turned my phone flashlight on and was greeted with more impenetrable fog.

By this point, I could feel the kiss of rain above me. The boom of thunder alerted me to make a decision. I took steps forward into the mouth of the boardwalk, searching the sandy floor, nothing. I turned my attention to the concrete wall; this had to be the spot. 

No sooner had I turned my attention there, a creaking crawl of sound rang out. Was someone above me? I shined my phone upward and saw nothing but the brilliance of the full moon between the cracks.

I took a deep breath and noticed something peeking through the sand to my left. In a shallow grave created by the wind and sand was a white square. I immediately grabbed it. Secret Treaties. Finally, I can get the hell out of here.

I inspected the LP for damage from the fall to find it was relatively unbothered, except for one thing. As I searched for my coffee stain, I was met with a surprise. The faint brown stain was overlapped by a new color.

Black?

There was a jet black streak smeared across the plastic sleeve. To my eyes, It was crusted and coarse, like concrete. I held it close to my flashlight, unable to decipher its meaning.

Just then, another creak. I frantically shun my light in both directions to find the origin. Nothing.

Something did catch my eye, the wall. The clear fluid I had noticed in my early encounter had created a slimy drip down the wall. It led to a burrowing path into the sand. It was as if something had crept in an effort to be undetected. The trail appeared to be thick and deliberate.

Using my light, I traced the journey of the fluid to find it created a path to where I found the album. It led even further. I took slight steps to discover more.

I couldn't stop; my mind was screaming at me to turn back, but my inquisitive feet prevailed. I must have hypnotically walked an entire two blocks investigating when I was stopped dead in my tracks.

I spotted the edge of a sharp corner sticking out of the sand. I knelt down to investigate, it was a photo. I lifted it high and shook the sand. I knew this picture. It was the snapshot of a father with his newly born daughter in his arms.

Bane?

We texted online, decided to see each other in person. We met and had a coffee. I find him attractive but he is introverted. I think that’s not a big of a deal but I haven’t felt a chemistry between us. We talked about serious topics and I found out his mindset is not too bad, we have the same view regarding a lot of topics. He mentioned that his parents are not that practicing which made me a bit skeptical, still gave him a chance cause he is aware of his personal deen. He said he doesn’t want me to text with other guys so we deactivated our profiles.

He is not the best at texting, he said that himself, so we decided to see each other again. Again we met for coffee, which is fine. And again we talked about basic topics regarding marriage. I understand his views and he is aware of the life after marriage even though he isn’t into deep talks, he had to take his time to reply and he couldn’t give an answer to everything. Still I cannot feel a chemistry. But I don’t understand why….Normally I feel exited to talk to someone and get to know them and seeing them. But he is too calm. He is a normal guy. It actually tends to getting boring…

He wants to see me again, and he said often is better than not seeing each other at all, but I don’t know if I want to. Rn I don’t see myself married to him. But it’s too early to say that. He is introverted, calm and just neutral.

I mean is it that important to feel a chemistry? Do I need to be exited to see him and to imagine myself as his wife and all I do is think about him? Or is it a good sign that I’m not too exited and he is just a stable man. Like he is just not toxic but a good catch? He also said he hasn’t met any women before.

I just don’t know if I might regret being with him. I don’t want to be with someone just for the sake of having someone. Why am I not impressed 😩 But the dates and how he is engaged in the conversation is just not fun. It’s not a natural vibe. All he does in his free time is work, sports, friends/family. Like I don’t see if he is actually a fun guy. Some men are just not enthusiastic….",3,1765323319.0,MuslimNikah,13,0.8,False

1pimufp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1pimufp/the_puzzle/,The Puzzle,"He found the puzzle box in his mailbox.

No return address. No note. Just a plain cardboard box with a jigsaw puzzle inside.

He brought it inside and dumped the pieces on his table.

A thousand pieces, maybe more.

He started working on it that evening. The edges first. Then the corners.

Slowly, an image emerged.

A living room.

His living room.

He paused. Stared at the pieces. The couch. The TV. The ceiling fan. Even the crack in the wall above the bookshelf.

All of it matched.

He kept going.

He worked on it after work. An hour here. Two hours there. Whenever he had time.

Days passed. Piece by piece, the image grew clearer.

The coffee table. The rug. The window with the blinds half-drawn.

Everything exact.

Then he noticed it.

In the corner, near the bookshelf. A dark shape. Blurred at first, but as he added more pieces, it sharpened.

A shadow.

Tall. Standing perfectly still.

He looked up at that corner of his living room.

Nothing there.

He went back to the puzzle.

He told himself it was just part of the design. Maybe an artistic choice. A flaw in the image.

But it bothered him.

The next evening, he worked on it again. Added more pieces. The table. The chair. The lamp.

He stopped.

The shadow had moved.

It wasn't in the corner anymore.

It was closer. Standing near the bookshelf now.

He stared at it.

That wasn't right. He remembered placing those pieces. The shadow had been farther back.

He shook his head. Kept working.

Two days later, he sat down after work. Added more pieces.

The shadow had moved again.

Now it was standing in the middle of the room. Closer to the table.

Closer to where he sat.

He looked around his living room.

Empty.

He went back to the puzzle.

Each time he worked on it, the shadow was closer.

Always closer.

He froze.

Looked around his living room.

Empty.

He looked back at the puzzle.

The shadow was standing directly behind the table now.

Where he was.

He looked over his shoulder.

Nothing.

Only two pieces left.

He picked up the second-to-last piece. Placed it.

The puzzle was almost complete.

His living room. Perfect. Exact.

And the shadow. Right behind where he sat.

He picked up the final piece.

His hand hovered over the gap.

He placed it.

The puzzle was complete. His living room. The shadow right behind where he sat.

He looked over his shoulder.

A voice whispered in his ear.

""You're the puzzle.""

...............  


Two detectives stood in the living room.

""When did the neighbor notice the smell?"" one asked.

""Three days ago. Called it in this morning.""

The detective looked around the room.

Blood everywhere. Pieces of flesh and bone scattered across the floor.

""How many?""

The other detective checked his notebook.

I also started B5 and B6. I was getting the Betahistine from a local compounder and it worked so well I started to wonder if I even needed it. (Spoiler: I’m an idiot) Because of the high compounding price I ordered some Serc from a Canadian pharmacy. While I was waiting for my order in the mail, I started taking less as a test…I went down to one pill a day for about a week. But then I started to feel a little something. Not quite dizziness, but on the verge. Right before Thanksgiving, my Canadian prescription finally arrived so I started taking two pills per day again. But I still felt a little off. I had a slight seashell noise in my right ear and my tinnitus was really bad. On Sunday I started feeling a little dizzy, but I took my betahistine and my B vitamins and had a good breakfast with water and coffee. Within an hour, I felt completely normal. Today I woke up feeling slightly off after having dreams of being dizzy. I quickly took my betahistine and b vitamins. But I had to take my car to the shop and I didn’t have time to eat. By the time I got home an hour later - it was definitely happening. I was feeling increasingly dizzy and nauseous, and I went straight to bed. I also took a Dramamine nondrowsy. Luckily I had the afternoon free and I could take a nap. It’s been a couple hours and I’m still feeling off-balance but I guess it’s getting better as I’m able to dictate this on my phone. But I’m wondering if the Canadian prescription could be not as good as what my local compounder was making. All I know is I haven’t felt as great — even though I’m back on two pills a day. And now for me to have this attack while taking it is pretty scary —not sure what to do next. Some good news is now the seashell noise in my right ear has gone.

We used to have a close friend who was also Hispanic and grew up in very different circumstances in life (lets call her Lexi), and was basically taught that it didn't matter if she used the n-word because 'she was brown' and that it really didn't matter (for more context Lexi was taught by her father who was previously in a gang/other shady situations that 'no one cared' as long as you weren't white). Well, before I knew it, Kate and Lexi were calling EACH OTHER the n-word, which I had brought up a couple of times but was quickly shut down about it, and I didn't want to come across as snarky or pretentious. Now, me and Kate aren't friends with Lexi anymore simply because she moved somewhere else and there was distance between us, but I can't help but keep thinking about *how* Kate thinks it's ok to use the n-word just because 'she's brown'. For more context, Kate does have a deeper complexion, but it is very obvious she is NOT African-American/black. Well, recently, we were sitting at a coffee shop (thankfully outside so no one could really hear us) and she randomly just drops the word in reference to another person. I tell her, ""Hey, Kate, you can't say that..."" and she goes, ""I'm brown (my name) it's the same thing..."" I've been debating having a conversation with her about it, because I don't understand why she keeps using it when a simple google search and common sense can teach her everything. I get it she looked up to Lexi because she was one of the first other Hispanic people she was friends with, but this (among other things Lexi has said I don't agree with) just doesn't make sense to me, especially since how much social weight the word has today. I can't decide if she just wanted to feel cool or something, or what. Before I end this post, I want to say that I am gay, so I've been trying to put this into context if instead of the n-word, she was saying the f-word. I really don't want to be the 'white knight' (no pun intended) or someone who gets offended for others (because trust me I know how it feels) but this just rubs me the wrong way. Should I have a conversation with Kate or just drop it and let her learn by herself? It's hard to decide since I myself am not African-American/black. Am I overreacting?

I’m currently writing a Friends fanfiction on Wattpad — a slowburn Chandler x OC story about grief, healing, soft banter and found family.

If you enjoy emotional, character-driven stories with a mix of humor and comfort, this might be something for you. 💛

Kayla Tribbiani never meant to rebuild her life in New York.
Not after everything she lost.
Not after grief hollowed out the parts of her that once felt bright.

But then Joey brings her back into the chaos of the city.
Chandler offers her coffee, sarcasm, and a gentleness he pretends he doesn’t have.
And the rest of the gang welcomes her like she has always been part of their world.

Between late-night confessions, laughter that feels safer than silence, and the moments where Chandler looks at her a little too long…
Kayla begins to feel something she didn’t expect:

Alive. Seen. Held.

It’s a story about healing, friendship, slowburn chemistry, and letting someone in again — even when it’s scary.

This story means a lot to me, and I’d love to hear your thoughts if you check it out.

While the Spells are hit and miss, I love the fact that you get an extra 4-5 castings of Misty Step per day because of it, and the bonus options you get for using a Misty Step mean you are even better at teleporting than most! Though to be honest, it feels like the Archfey peeks at 3rd level, and steadily goes downhill afterwards, especially compared to different classes.

Except, then we get the Capstone at level 14. Betwitching Magic, which reads as follows:
> Your patron grants you the ability to weave your magic with teleportation. Immediately after you cast an Enchantment or Illusion spell using an action and a spell slot, you can cast Misty Step as part of the same action and without expending a spell slot.

Needless to say, this is quite an attention-grabbing feature, but while there is some pretty strong high-level Enchantment and Illusion spells out there - Hold Monster and Synaptic Static come to mind - that still runs into the ol Warlock issue of limited spell slots per short rest (though hey, you do have 3 now). And I'm wondering if the good people of 3d6 have suggestions on how to abuse this to heck and back to really become a teleporting monster?

Currently, my thoughts are having Magic Initiate for Command and a 2-level dip in Sorcerer. Basically, we're doing old Coffee-lock shenanigans, though with the focus on being able to use 1st level spell slots for stuff like Command rather than just double-dipping Eldirtich Blast... which we can do? But like, that's boring, and we don't even have any of the cool new spells to buff up the EB damage. 

Admittedly, the build is much, much stronger if your DM allows Betwitching Magic to work on a Bonus *Action* and not specifically an *Action* alone. There's some conditional ruling up in the air there.

What do you all think? What other ways can we abuse Bewitching Magic?",1,1765322338.0,3d6,5,1.0,False

I just got a GAGGIA magenta plus. Ive done the first steps but im worried how to maintain it and clean it. There is a gaggia cleaning guide on youtube which says clean every week the group (the machine inside) and every month put lubricant on it which i dont know where to find. Is that a bit too escessive? I know that i have to clean the coffee residue and water almost every day though.

How often do you clean and what parts of your machine?

I used to drink cold drip with the dripster 3 before in which i was wasting a lot of coffee because of how delicate the process is and not a thing must go even slightly wrong. So i decided to buy this espresso gaggia magenta plus to be able to drink my favorite freddo espresso (yes i am from greece) but the cold drip had much more aroma and i could sense much better every little coffee note, is thay normal?

I use 40ml shot, double shots, 4/5 coffee strenght and temperature on high - does the temperature on high burn the coffee?

1. MORNING SEX

It is difficult for me to describe just how painful and disheartening it is when you become upset with me for not wanted to have sex, especially when I was as clear as possible about my reasons. 

It wasn't about you - it was about ME not feeling well. I communicated that to you openly and honestly. I even offered to re-connect for make-up sex after I had something to eat and felt better. I did my best to be respectful of both my own body, and your feelings. But instead of meeting me with understanding or respect for my boundaries, it felt like you took it personally, and that really hurt. I did my best to take your feelings into account and to not let my own emotions/feelings cause me to react poorly. So, I got out of bed to take care of the dogs and make us coffee. A gesture of kindness in the moment to let you know that I am here to support you and your feelings. 

I think we both know that good sex is mutual. It requires both of us to feel safe, respected, and fully-willing. No one should be made to feel guilty or pressured into being intimate when they are not in the right physical or emotional space, for any reason.

I want to be clear: I have never, and I will never, get upset with you for turning down sex. Your body is yours, and I respect that completely. Respecting each other's autonomy in this way is, to me, one of the most important pillars of a healthy relationship.

In the grand scheme of things - I think we have a strong, and fulfilling sex life. But I also know that rejection - even in rare instances - can feel deeply personal. And yet, what happened that morning in bed was not a rejection. It was a request for patience and understanding while I wasn't feeling my best. It wasn't part of an ongoing pattern of continued rejection. It was a one-off moment. And even then, I still tried to be considerate. I offered to reconnect later once I was feeling better.

What has been frustrating to me is that, even with an upset stomach, I still got up, fed the dogs, took them outside, and made us coffee. I was doing my best to rally and meet you where you were. Then, when I suggested something to eat for breakfast - something I needed to help me feel better - you shot down the idea of cinnamon rolls before lunch and made no suggestions for an alternative. That moment felt dismissive, controlling, and frankly confusing given everything that had already happened.

2. LEAVING FOR THE PARTY

I get that family events can be stressful. There's a lot to juggle, there's a lot of expectations, and I know you were feeling that pressure. But I really need to say this: stress does not justify being snappy or rude to your partner. It is not okay to take that frustration out on me, even unintentionally.

I know you said that you were feeling sensitive and cranky that day. I appreciated you naming that. I really did. That honesty and transparency helps. But what also matters is how we treat each other in these moods.

Being in a bad space, does not give you a free pass to be dismissive, impatient, or snappy at your partner. You would not appreciate or tolerate being on the receiving end of that, and neither do I.

But here's what really got to me: I was trying to help. I made the coffee's, I fed the dogs, I did these things so you wouldn't have to. I asked numerous times how I could support you. You asked me to drive and I didn't hesitate to do-so, so that you could have time to write the birthday card to your dad without distraction. I was doing everything I could to lighten your load that morning. 

And despite that, when I showed the slightest sign of frustration, about how I was being spoken to, and treated, all you could say is ""I shouldn't me made to feel like I'm in trouble."" 

That hurt. 

When you do, or say, or act in a way that affects me, and I speak up, or you can hear frustration in my voice. It is not to punish you. It's not to ""make you feel in trouble."" It's to be seen. It's to say ""Hey! this doesn't feel fair, this doesn't feel kind, and I need you to hear that."" Turning that back onto me is hurtful and manipulative. It felt like you were shifting the focus away from the behavior that caused the hurt, and onto the fact that I noticed it and was affected by it. That dynamic makes it difficult to feel safe.

I want to be clear that I'm not expecting perfection here. We are human. We all have moments where we allow stress and external pressures get the better of us. I have done it too. But when that happens, when our partner is being affected by our actions, what matters is how we respond. Do we own it? Do we apologize? Or do we make the other person feel bad for being affected? -- whether the action was intentional or not. 

I want to be someone who supports you when things are stressful. But I also need to know that I can be allowed to hurt. I can speak up and bring your attention towards something that hurts me - without that being turned against me. I want our relationship to be one where both of us feel respected, heard, and supported - even when things aren't easy.

3. AT HOME

After your dad's party, when we were on the couch outside, I tried to have a conversation with you about how emotionally drained I felt as a result of the ongoing conflict between us. I wasn't blaming you, I was simply stating that the number and frequency of conflicts we've been having lately is increasing, an objective fact. 

Instead of listening, instead of hearing me, instead of engaging in good faith, you immediately became defensive and pushed back. You attempted to normalize the distress I have been experiencing by telling me that conflict of this type is just part of a normal relationships, and then you fought me tooth and nail on every single point I tried to make afterwards.

You didn't just disagree with me - you dismissed my feelings. You rejected the very things I was trying to express, and it was clear that you weren't interested in listening, or understanding what I was going through. You made it about YOUR VERSION of things, not mine.

In these moments, it's not about who's right or wrong, it's about acknowledging that we are both affected by the conflict, and showing empathy for what the other person is feeling. Instead, you fought me at every turn. And that made me feel like I had to scream and fight to be heard. 

Unfortunately, this hasn't been the first time. Just yesterday, in the middle of a heart-felt apology, I was cut-off, multiple times. You would finish my sentences for me, inserting your own words and casting your own version of reality onto me. You put words in my mouth, and in doing so, erased my experience entirely. Making it seem like I am saying things that I am not. 

It didn't stop there. Later in the car, at the entrance to the dog-park, I shared my feelings with you and you responded by saying ""it's ok if you feel the opposite."" 

That hit me like a punch to the gut. You were rejecting the truth I was offering you. My truth. The truth of how I felt, and what was real for me in that moment. You completely turned it around and implied that I was being dishonest, when in fact, all I was doing was being vulnerable with you.

You didn't just disagree with me - you invalidated my experience. You made me feel like my feelings and my truth didn't matter, that they weren't real, or worse, that I couldn't be trusted when I expressed them.

If I'm being honest, I consider this to be manipulative behavior. It's a way to shut down the conversation to avoid facing uncomfortable truths. It is not ok to put words in someone's mouth, or twist their reality to fit your own. That is not how healthy relationships function.

Finally, the other night, when you asked if I wanted to talk and you insisted it was a safe space to be vulnerable. I wanted to tell you that it was difficult for me to feel safe in that moment, but you scoffed at me before even allowing me to finish a single sentence. 

I know you didn't mean to do it, but it still happened. And the fact that you didn't intend to scoff doesn't make the impact any less real. The pain it caused is still there. 

This is where we need to take responsibility for our actions. If I've hurt you, I own it. If I've made a mistake, I'm accountable for it. The same should apply to you. Intention does not negate the effect. We need to acknowledge when we've hurt each other regardless of whether it was intentional.

4. FINAL THOUGHTS

I know I don't always handle these situations perfectly. When I feel ignored, dismissed, or emotionally invalidated, I yell, I scream, I get angry, I raise my voice, and then ultimately, I end up hurting you. I'm not proud of that, but it often feels like the only way to be heard.

When every attempt to express how I feel is interrupted, twisted, or turned into something it's not, when my words are met with defensiveness or deflection instead of curiosity and care, I snap.

And while I can absolutely work on communicating in these moments, I need you to understand why it happens. I need you to hear me before it gets that far. I need to feel safe being vulnerable - to be able to speak without getting scoffed at, cut-off, or told I'm wrong about my experience. 

I'm upset because I feel I'm constantly fighting for basic emotional recognition - just to have my words taken seriously, my feelings handled with care, and my perspective respected. 

I'm open to doing the work - individually and together. I'm open to therapy. I'm open to growth. But I also need to be honest with myself and with you. I can't keep being in a relationship where I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. Where I'm constantly bracing for when things fall apart. That sort of emotional volatility makes it hard for me to feel safe, let along secure. And even when things are good between us, that underlying fear and anxiety still lingers. 

I need to see real, measurable improvement in how we handle conflict, how we communicate, and how we take care of each other emotionally. The current dynamic may work for you - you may consider it normal to relationships - but it doesn't work for me.

I'm too emotionally sensitive to keep living in a cycle where I'm either apologizing for how I feel or bracing for how you'll react. That is not sustainable. Not while we're planning a wedding. Not in a long-term partnership.

I love you. I want this to work. I believe we can get to a healthier place. I'm willing to put in the effort every step of the way - but it has to be mutual. Talking isn't enough. We need to act. 

I can't keep going in circles like this. Something has to change. And it has to start now.

Resettled to another continent without being able to take my Bezzera Strega with me. Ordered the Argos Odyssey on arrival in March. Surviving on Filter and Aero Press until forecasted delivery March 2026.

An espresso is usually ca. 90% water and ca. 10% dissolved coffee particles.

Instant coffee is pure dried formerly dissolved coffee particles.

Mixing 90% Water eg. 27 grams with 10% instant coffee  eg. 3 grams actually produces something that tastes and feels a lot like espresso. Of course it doesn't produce any crema at all but James Hoffman argues that crema is actually not super desireable and I can live without it as well. It looks a bit sad though.

Tldr: mix 9 parts water with 1 part instant coffee to get  an espresso like coffee drink.",0,1765321703.0,espresso,6,0.14,False

I'm not sure if this is the best sub to post in, but I'm hoping yall can give me some advice. I'm currently trying to start a matcha/coffee popup and the licensing/permits are truly getting me into huge headaches. I'd really like to start at lowkey farmer's markets or events so if anyone has suggestions on those please send them my way as well!! BUT the biggest headache I've had so far is the requirement of having a commercial kitchen. Does anyone have any recommendations of commercial kitchens or shared kitchens that I could rent for short times? Honestly, I would only need them for 1-2 hours before each event to prep syrups. I would be making every drink to order and on the spot. I've seen a few kitchens so far but honestly I'm not sure if the pricing is right..

I'm touring with a dance troupe, we're in NZ at the moment. Staying at a pretty nice, but unremarkable hotel (based on my hotel experience, which is minimal to this point in life apart from this tour.)

I had some dirty dishes building up; congealed coffee and day-old chicken scraps, and figured I should do some dishes washing. Crap goes in sink, plug in, detergent in, hot water on, wait. 

Phone rings. It's my partner, so I grab my headphones, do a little bit of faffing getting them to talk to the phone, plug my phone in, and we start chatting. I completely forget about the sink. For like 20 minutes. 

At one point the call dropped out, and I took my headphones off... And that's when I heard/realised. 

Fuuuuuck. Fuck. The tiles are 2cm deep under water, it's saturated the carpet. I get busy mopping up with towels and wringing them out in the sink, and the downstairs neighbour knocks on my door, it's running through into their room too. 

Fuuuuuck ><

Hotel owner was really good about it, got a dehumidifier going and some fresh towels, and told me not to worry - while also mentioning that the carpet downstairs is only a few months old and cost a packet to install. 

Fast forward to this morning and my rooms carpet is fine, but downstairs has to be replaced. It'll be an insurance job, but it's still getting charged out to the company I work for... Something tells me that this is gonna be the last time I work for them.

TL;DR: forgot I was filling the sink in my hotel room. Flooded my room and the room below me, costing the company I work for a tonne of money & making me feel like a right idiot. ",11,1765321354.0,tifu,1,0.74,False
1pim6qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnoxTherapy/comments/1pim6qf/mental_health_during_holiday_prep_why_it_gets/,Mental Health During Holiday Prep: Why It Gets Overwhelming & How to Take Care of Yourself,"The Christmas season is marketed as “the most wonderful time of the year,” but for many people, the prep leading up to it can feel anything but magical. If you’re finding yourself stressed, overstimulated, or emotionally drained as December ramps up, you’re not alone.

Here are a few reasons why holiday prep can impact mental health and what you can do to care for yourself:

1. The Pressure to “Make It Perfect”

Holiday expectations can skyrocket. Set a bare minimum list.

2. Financial Stress Adds Up

Even small expenses feel big when stacked together. Create a realistic spending cap and stick to it.

3. Increased Social Obligations

December can quickly overload introverts and neurodivergent folks (and honestly, everyone else too). Honor your energy. Say “maybe” instead of “yes.” Leave early if you need to.

4. Grief Hits Harder Around the Holidays

Make space for both joy and sorrow. Light a candle, keep a ritual, or share a memory. Honor what you’re carrying.

5. Routines Get Disrupted

December rearranges everything. Keep at least one grounding routine (morning coffee, evening walk, journaling).

6. Comparison Culture Is Loud

Social media turns the holidays into a highlight reel. Curate your feed so it supports your mental health, not drains it. 

It’s okay to slow down, to simplify, to set boundaries, and to choose peace over perfection.

What’s one thing you’re doing this year to protect your mental health during the holiday season?",1,1765321332.0,KnoxTherapy,0,1.0,False
