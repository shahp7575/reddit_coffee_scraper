Do you feel like you’re made of contradictions? Tired but restless. Lonely but full of love. Idealistic but a little bruised from trying too hard in a world that often doesn’t meet you halfway. Because me too

I'm 25, based in Italy, and quietly hoping this message reaches someone who knows that life’s not just about chasing milestones but about finding someone whose soul feels like a safe place. 

Someone who won’t just get me, but who’s also walking through life with open eyes and an even more open heart.

I volunteer when I can, because if I want the world to be softer, more just, more kind, I have to help make it that way. I believe in showing up, not just with words but with action. 

If you're indifferent to oppression or proudly neutral in the face of injustice, we won't click. I believe being kind doesn't mean being passive. I stand with Palestine, and if human rights aren’t a priority for you, we’re not meant for each other.

But this post isn’t just about politics. It’s about wanting to build something gentle and real with someone who's aware. 

Someone who knows that empathy is a muscle  one we grow by being present, listening deeply, and not turning away when things get hard.

About me:

- 6ft, slim build, dark eyes & darker humor (when sleep-deprived)

- Emotionally literate, sometimes overly so. I feel a lot. But I also care a lot.

- Deep thinker. Coffee lover on slow mornings. Volunteering makes me feel less helpless.

- I crave intimacy in the little things like shared playlists, lazy dinners, voice notes that go “so I was just thinking...”

Currently working and studying. Life is chaotic, but there’s beauty in the mess they say.


About you (maybe):

You believe love isn’t found in grand gestures but in consistency. Maybe you cry at movies and care about more than just your own world. You like vulnerable conversations, even the ones with no neat endings. You are thoughtful, curious, and want to grow with someone, not just date them.

Bonus if:

- You find bookstores romantic

- You speak your mind, but always with heart

- You hate bigots and refuse to normalize cruelty

- You love those quiet, late-night “what even is happiness?” kind of talks


What I want:

Not perfection. Just someone sincere. A person I can be soft with who’ll meet me in the middle of all this trying. Maybe we find comfort in each other’s chaos. Maybe we just keep each other company in this strange, beautiful journey of figuring life out.

She had me at a very young age and my little brother soon after that so she was growing up while raising two children and i understand how hard she worked to take care of us but just because my brother and I are alive doesn't mean she is a Gold Star Mom. Her issue is my Partner (34 Male)....My boyfriend is currently the stay at home parent since my income supports all of us and our son (from previous relationship) is special needs its easier for him to be home when he get out of school and for school brakes, holidays ,grading days ....etc. My mother is extremely against how we run our house hold (side note we are Black and my boyfriend is White this is relevant to the story). She feels my sons life is some how lacking because My boyfriend doesn't have a job, and maybe 3 times she's came to my hose its 'not clean' which is code for not clean to her standards , but she is germophobic and a neat freak and has been that way since i was little and I've always kept a ""lived in "" type of house yes I might have a dish or two in the sink and my coffee table is a catch all for keys and receipts and other random things, but my carpets are clean and my house smells good and I dust twice a week because of my allergies. She also feels I'm not taking care of my son properly and is constantly on me about his hair , how he interacts at school , what his hobbies are and when he goes to the dentist, I ask her to not be in any state of undress in front of my son because he's getting older (11) and that's not appropriate she says ""I'm his grandma it fine"" as if she's not a woman , I asked her not to cut his hair because I take him to some one who has the same hair texture and has a license, she cut 4 inches off his hair any way, and that triggered me since my ex husband did the same thing and it ruined his hair. I've since expressed to her that she is crossing so may of my boundaries and she so lovingly refers to my feelings and request as ""White people shit"" .....I'm tired having to defend my family dynamic and my feelings and boundaries just for her to dismiss them and never change. She wants to sit and talk this weekend and I'm not looking forward to it at all because it will surely end in disaster......So would I be the Asshole if I go low/no contact with my mother?",1,1760645177.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,0,1.0,False

I tried most of it, but honestly? It never stuck.

What finally worked for me was embarrassingly simple. Nothing Instagram-worthy, but it cut almost an hour of wasted time out of my mornings:

1. **No phone for the first 30 minutes** I used to lose 20–25 minutes scrolling before even getting out of bed. Now I leave my phone charging in the next room and use a cheap alarm clock. The difference is huge.
2. **Batch the basics** Instead of making tiny decisions every morning (what to wear, what to eat, what bag to pack), I set up a “default.” Same breakfast (overnight oats), clothes picked the night before, bag ready at the door. Saves me at least 15 minutes of dithering.
3. **Timers for transitions** Brushing teeth, making coffee, quick stretch.  I set a 5-minute timer for each. Weirdly, it keeps me from drifting into daydreaming or standing around.
4. **First task = one small win** I don’t start with email. Instead, I write down one 5-minute task (like clearing my desk or reviewing today’s top 3 priorities). I use a system which makes me feel rewarded for completing every small task. For anyone interested, I've left it in my profile. It creates momentum instead of dragging me into other people’s agendas.

**Result:** I went from needing about 2 hours to “start my day” to 1 hour. That extra hour now goes into focused work before distractions hit, and it feels like I’m finally ahead instead of playing catch-up.

Not glamorous. Not aesthetic. But it works for me.

So I (30f) am in a polyamorous triad with J (27m) and E (34m). Our condo is getting some repairs done rn and so we're staying in an Airbnb temporarily. E works in person but J and I both work from home and usually have set aside workspaces. In the Airbnb, we're a little more cramped, and I went from having bookshelves as my background to having the bedroom/part of the kitchen instead.

I love my job and have a really awesome team. The culture is very chill and professional, not a lot of small talk or personal info sharing, which is definitely my preference. They do not know that I have two partners. My immediate team (5 people) is generally cameras on for small meetings, cameras off with bigger groups or other teams.

You can probably see where this is going. E brought me coffee this morning before leaving for work while I was in a team meeting, and gave me a kiss on the head on camera to say bye. Not an issue, def something other partners on my team have done before. But then he went and said bye to J, who is working out of the kitchen rn. J got out of his seat and kissed E goodbye properly, and I'm fairly certain it was all on camera behind me (I was multitasking and only reopened the zoom window in time to catch the end of it). Nobody in my meeting said anything, but a meeting with HR just got put on my calendar tomorrow morning and now I'm kind of panicking.

There is literally no reason for the meeting except this incident. My job is normally so deeply low-key, I've been here for 3 years and it's such a unicorn role I will be absolutely crushed if I get fired over this. I know gender and sexuality are protected classes but being poly def isn't. At the same time I cannot fathom why I'm the world they would care, it really is not at all like my team to be anything but apathetic to the personal life of others.

1o8goym,https://www.reddit.com/r/IDontWorkHereLady/comments/1o8goym/the_employee_had_to_duck_out_for_a_minute_and_im/,The employee had to duck out for a minute and I'm just helping buy time until they get back,"So I used to work at one of the biggest stores in a major shopping centre. Like, we'd have  20-30 to people on each day. Now because the centre was so big, a lot of employees of different stores would either recognise or even become friends with people from other stores because we basically did any shopping in the centre to make life easier, plus a lot of places would hook each other up on pricing, free coffee cards, stuff like that.

  
Well, eventually I became friends with the manager of the small menswear store downstairs, we'd stop by each other's works and chat during breaks, hang out after work sometimes, mutual staff pricing, you get the idea. Because I was in his store so often I ended up becoming friends with the other staff. Well his store would often only have 1 person on for the whole day, or only have 2 for a 3 hour period so people could have their breaks. Now, it was a right PITA to lock up because you had to bring a bunch of merch back in, close and lock the doors, then when you got back do the reverse. And you would likely lose whatever sale you might get because they'd just go to one of the other stores. This meant if it was only 1 person they might not go to the bathroom, or even drink water. Would keep snacks behind the register for food.

  
Because of this, sometimes I'd drop by and whoever was on would say something like they hadn't been to the bathroom yet or really needed to get a quick snack. And because they all knew and trusted me they'd ask me to just mind the store for 2 minutes, greet and help as best I can, they'll be right back. Key point here, neither their store nor mine had uniforms, and I largely wore clothes from theirs because the discount was so good.

  
So on multiple occasions someone would walk in, I'd greet them, occasionally point out where certain things were. Most of the time it was just someone browsing, but occasionally they'd want to buy something and I'd have to explain ""yeah, I don't actually work here, just mates with the guy who does and he just ran to the loo. Should be back any moment and can ring you up. Ahh, yep, here they are."" Customer just looking so confused about the situation, but one good thing about Australians is we can often have the oddest situations and just go ""yeah alright"" and carry on like it's perfectly normal",6,1760645067.0,IDontWorkHereLady,0,1.0,False

A good plot twist, an unexpected note in a song, a narrative development that catches the reader off guard—a whisky unlike anything you ever imagined. Coming off Talisker’s briny aromas, tasting Laphroaig Oak Select was full of surprises. For starters, it’s pronounced /ləˈfrɔɪɡ/. The surprises I’m talking about go beyond its rich, marvelous history—its roots on Islay, or how a distillery survived and found its way into the skilled hands of Bessie Williamson, breaking paradigms the whisky world had long internalized. This singular whisky—renowned for its peaty/smoky character—with approximately 10% of its barley malted on-site using hand-cut Islay peat and finished in smaller casks, is non-chill-filtered. To me, Laphroaig stands like the Valkyries—especially in Die Walküre, the second opera of Richard Wagner’s epic tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung. Or even in God of War 3, as fierce, elegant, and dangerous adversaries. Or Joan of Arc. In all these cases, appearances mislead the onlooker, and the end result is far more impressive. I expected—perhaps naively—something rustic and, why not, as salty as Talisker. I expected something in line with Laphroaig’s marketing—the idea that peat and smoke aren’t for everyone. Perhaps peat and smoke truly aren’t. But what is it to step into Laphroaig’s world—even if only once? The aroma—this was unmistakable—filled my entire room when I opened the bottle. It was as if someone had misted perfume into the air. Smoke, peat, a discreet iodine note, earth, and something green (“like wet grass”) quickly filled my nostrils. Alcoholic intensity: 2+/4+. Palate (a truly singular sensorial experience): a touch of bitterness; subtle coffee; persimmon? (perhaps from the astringency, though it read as something sweet—like yellow fruits); mint; something herbal—medicinal plants? No heat, a short body, bitterness on the finish (like ginger at the very end, only a bit more bitter). Incredibly easy and pleasant to drink.

Distillery: Laphroaig. ABV: 40%. Age: NAS. Service: neat, in a Glencairn glass; rested 5 minutes.

the tired smile i wear like armor.

people think i’m fine.
i laugh, i joke,
i show up.
but i only show the parts of me
that look okay in the light.
the rest stays locked away,
in the dark corners where no one goes.

the truth?
i’ve become so cold.
so emotionally distant
that even joy feels like a chore.
nothing feels like an achievement anymore,
it just feels like,
“thank god, it’s over.”

i used to feel everything too deeply.
maybe i still do.
i just don’t let it out anymore.
because every time i tried,
it hurt.
so i built walls.
and now those walls are all i know.

the pressure to perform,
to be someone,
to always do well,
to not fail,
it’s too much sometimes.
and i can’t tell anyone,
because people see me as strong.
and once you’re seen that way,
you don’t get to fall apart.

so i keep myself busy.
work.
music.
noise.
anything that keeps me from thinking.
because i know what happens when i stop,
the silence starts talking,
and i don’t always like what it says.

the isolation i built to protect myself
is now the thing that’s killing me.
i pushed people away to stay safe,
and now i ache for closeness
that i no longer know how to accept.

i used to laugh easily.
i used to find beauty in small things,
coffee on quiet mornings,
conversations that made me forget time.
now everything feels distant,
like i’m watching life through glass,
pressing my palms against it,
but never quite touching.

i’m tired.
of pretending.
of performing.
of being the person everyone thinks i am.

and i think tonight,
it’s the child in me writing this,
the one who still remembers
what it felt like to dream,
to feel,
to believe that life could be gentle.

maybe he just wants to be seen again.
to be held,
even if just in words.

i don’t know what tomorrow will bring.
maybe i’ll find a reason to stay a little longer.
maybe not.

1o8giun,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1o8giun/dont_know_if_i_should_nip_this_in_the_butt_or/,Dont know if I should nip this in the butt or keep a bit of faith.,"So im a 30yo M and im dating a 25 yo F. We met on hinge. She liked my profile and I liked her back. Im not one to waste my time or hers so I skipped the awkward text phase and asked to meet up within the first week. She agreed. 
Started off with
- A movie (she likes horror)

- Dinner date at a fancy (but not over the top) restaraunt and walked around a nice park area to let the food settle and just converse. (I made it CLEAR im looking for something serious and that I dont even have the capability to juggle a roster of girls. I give them-(her) my undivided attention.

- Dinners here and there as we're both busy 
(she's in school) 
(I take care of a sick mother so I retired her and im working on furthering my career) 

- Went to a farmers market at a Fall festival event then another movie 

- Told her I had planned/reserved a small 2 day trip in the mountains for us at a super nice house/airbnb/Yurt style cabin. (She knows I hike and camp alot but this isnt even camping its got literally everything and its super nice inside) shes super siked and excited for it. 
I pay for everything and im not expecting *or would even want* her to pay me back in anyway.
I dont touch or grab her yet as its not official and I dont want to come off like that. Just a hug when we see and leave each other. 

< so now some things I want to get off my chest to know if im thinking too much or is she playing with me. 
- I noticed when I got her a coffee, she got something I never tried and when I asked to try it she let me and I took a tiny sip and she didnt touch it again. *fine with me, right. 
- She also never within the 2+ months we been talking asked or planned anything its always me, which for the first month ok I get it shes testing me and how interested I am. 
- She's also fairly shelled. Meaning like I cant get a read on her. She comes out every single time hasn't missed one day where I ask her. When she had something come up she still assured me to meet after she took care of it. Cool. Love it. 
- She didnt want to take a picture at the farm festival with some goats *I figured itd just be a light hearted picture with some funny goats* 
- She is wishy washy with texting. When I flirt she doesnt reciprocate anything back. 
- When we're together it just feels like our convos and feelings for each other are the same and kinda dry but only her side. 
As I've explained above. I've made my side clear that I want to move forward but I mentally cannot force myself to make a move until she gives me even a modicum of reciprocation. 
Thinking of confronting her on this before our trip. - She mentioned early on that she left a fairly long relationship like 4+ years after her guy cheated so I've been essentially taking it super slow and trying to show her what real affection and understanding is. She said while they dated she was always the planner and initiating things. But wont do a single thing for me to at least show SOME interest aside from meeting up. 
I get her gifts (small things like candles and games we could play on our trip). She still hasnt gotten or paid for anything or offered to me. 
I remember details about her that I wouldn't do for any other person like her favorite color, food, hobbies, her birthday (I dont even know my own brothers birthdays). I tell her she doesnt need to get work done on her face as I find her perfect right now. (Make a lighthearted joke about how im also saving her money) lol. 
She said she was baking the other day with her sister I made a joke about ""hmm here I was about to ask you to make something for me"" 
*no response* 
She doesnt really ask much about me... like
Am I just being used? And if so, what for. 
Again I get things for her and pay for every dinner and date but like its not like I could buy her a car or house im not rich by any means but I make just about 6 figures. 90K-110K (which she doesnt know) 
She makes good money too so... Lol. 
Im so lost. Is this what people call avoident? Like still hung up on her ex but then why even be on a dating app at all. ",1,1760644700.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

1o8gi25,https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1o8gi25/how_to_use_the_education_skills/,How to use the Education Skills,"Good evening choombas, heavy armor lizard here. Thought I give some players and GMs a little helpful tip with skills. So Cyberpunk has always been a skill-based system. And it shows with the vast quantity of skills on your character sheet. 

So its not uncommon to ask how certain skills are used and what their purpose is. And no other category gets this more than the 'Education Skills' category. Ranging from Education to even Language, a ton of people question what these are used for. So today, I'm gonna go through these and basically describe how each of them can be used. And some of these may be pulled from adventures or dlc where they're used. And this isn't extensive either. This is just giving ways on how they're used.

###Skills

#####Accounting
> Skill of balancing books, creating false books, and identifying them, juggling numbers, creating budgets and handling day-to-day business operations.

Accounting is basically for handling money, looking at accounting books and seeing if they're legit or not. Its all about handling money.

- Example: Rex the Fixer comes across a balance book owned by 6th Street. Passing a DV15 check, he realizes that the gang is getting some equipment from a Militech informant.

#####Animal Handling
> Skill of handling, training, and caring for animals.

Exactly like it says. This skill is all about handling animals. Last year, we got the *Your New Best friend* DLC which is all about commanding cyberpets.

- Example 1: If your Base (Stat + Skill) is lower than 10, the pet will refuse to obey your commands. If 10 or higher, the pet will love you and fight alongside you.
- Example 2: Jax's pet Cyberbear is thinking of going after a fleeing Ganger. Jax passes a DV13 check to command the Bear to return.

#####Bureaucracy
> Skill for dealing with bureaucrats, cutting red tape, knowing who to talk to in a bureaucracy, how to reach them, and how to extract information from bureaucracies.

Bureaucracy is many ways can be described as the more corporate mirror to Streetwise. Whereas Streetwise is for handling the street element, Bureaucracy is for handling corporations and governments and similar.

- Example 1: The team is sneaking into a gala. With a DV13 check, the team can see the basic flow of personnel coming in and out of the building.
- Example 2: An Edgerunner is trying to liven up the office for a meeting. With a DV13 check, the Edgerunner can tidy up the place to make it more 'lived in'.
- Example 3: A Fixer is having a meeting in his HQ Lounge with a corporate ally. Using the +2 bonus from his Lounge, the Fixer can tell his ally isn't being all truthful about the drama happening in the department.

#####Business
> Skill regarding knowledge of basic business practices, laws of supply and demand, employee management, procurement, sales, and marketing.

Unlike with Bureaucracy, Business encompasses every about business, from corps to street stuff and so on. Including stuff about sales, marketing, deals, etc.

- Example 1: Ms. Mynah, via passing a DV13 check, explains what Fixie's courier business entails.
- Example 2: With a DV15 check, the crew can determine that the only reason Depuy is still untouched is because the couriers want the goods in the warehouse to stay intact.

#####Composition
> The required Skill for writing songs, articles, or stories.

Like it says. This skill entails everything about writing stuff like songs or newspaper articles.

- Example 1: While in a HQ Studio, the Rockerboy gets a +2 bonus to their check to writing up a new song.
- Example 2: Using the evidence they gained from their HQ Evidence Wall, the Lawman gets a +3 bonus to their check to write up a police report to send to their superior.

#####Criminology
> Skill of discovering clues by dusting for fingerprints, doing ballistic tests, examining 
evidence, and searching through police records and files. 

This skill is about investigating crimes and looking for clues associated with crimes and the like.

- Example 1: After uncovering a severed head, a DV13 check reveals the head matches the description of an important figure's late spouse.
- Example 2: Upon searching a suspect's house, the Lawman passes a DV9 check to see that they were trying to create a bomb.

#####Cryptography
> Skill of encrypting and decoding messages.

Like it says. This skill is about encrypting or decrypting messages.

- Example 1: With a DV21 check, the Netrunner realizes the Fixer has unearthed signals coming from the bottom of the bay, likely from unrecovered loot.
- Example 2: With a DV24 check, the Solo decodes a message of an incoming Militech strike at a Maelstrom hideout.


#####Deduction
> Skill of taking several clues and leaping to a non-obvious conclusion or medical diagnosis.

- Example 1: With a DV13 check, the Lawman and Media realize that the series of incidents has strong Bozo vibes.
- Example 2: With a DV15 check, the crew deduces a group of suspects came in the arcade and attacked the patrons with weapons.

#####Education
> Skill of general knowledge, equivalent to a basic school education, allowing you to know how to read, write, use basic math, and know enough history to get by.

This skill is about general knowledge and history.

- Example 1: With a DV15 check, the crew realizes Major Stiles lost her child a few weeks ago.
- Example 2: Due to his legendary status, the Fixer can explain the history of Crusher, former leader of Maelstrom, with a DV9 check.

#####Gamble
> Skill of knowing how to figure odds and play games of chance successfully.

Like it says. This skill is about gambling.

- Example: The Body Lotto is happening. With a DV17 check, the crew's Rockerboy gets the correct number of people killed.

#####Language
> Skill of speaking a particular language.

Now this skill confuses a lot of people. People get the flavor text and think their character is not fluent if they're not at least Base 10. Truth of matter is, Language as said in the text is more than speaking. It governs not just fluency but how well you know the Language. Slang, language rules, you name it. There's a lot of people that speak English just fine but they're not exactly the most fluent.

- Example 1: Listening into a decoded message, the crew hears Tyger Claws speaking in Japanese talking about Shinobu the Second's meeting with those in the Night City Co-Prosperity Sphere.
- Example 2: With a DV15 check, the crew's Fixer who speaks Chinese can deduce what David Ling Po is speaking about as they hide behind a wall.

#####Library Search
> Skill of using databases, the Data Pool, libraries, and other compiled information sources to find facts.

This skill is all about looking up information in databases and other sources of info like a book.

- Example 1: Similar to the example in Criminology, a DV13 check reveals the head matches the description of an important figure's late spouse.
- Example 2: With a DV9 check, a Media pulls up some videos of IBDY's songs.
- Example 3: With a DV13 check, a Fixer pulls up some info about the crime their crew is investigating.

#####Local Expert
> Skill of knowing a specific area well and knowing the agendas of its various factions, both political and criminal. You must choose a specific location whenever you increase this Skill, which cannot be any larger than a single neighborhood or community.

This skill is about using knowledge of an area to your advantage, including info you know about gangs.

- Example 1: With a DV13 check with Old Combat Zone, the Fixer informs the crew that the Iron Sights have territory here.
- Example 2: With a DV9 check with The Glen, the Media identifies the coffee joint belongs to Kasim.
- Example 3: With a DV13 check, the crew finds a shortcut to get them to Camden Court more quickly.

######Science
> Skill for knowing how to design experiments, write scientific papers, test hypotheses, and discuss with other academics in a particular field of science. An area of study must be specified whenever this Skill is increased. Possible options include: Geology, Mathematics, Physics, Zoology, Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, and History.

This skill is about using your knowledge in a particular science.

- Example 1: With Science (Chemistry), the crew's Medtech uses a HQ Medbay to produce a few batches of Synthcoke.
- Example 2: With a DV13 Science (Biology) check, the crew realizes that there's a lot of blood on the door and not paint.

#####Tactics
> Skill of managing a large-scale battle effectively and efficiently. A Character with this Skill usually knows what must be done to direct a battle, and how an enemy force may react.
I covered this skill a few months ago [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkred/comments/1lgh2ex/use_of_tactics_in_and_out_of_combat/) but lemme recap: Tactics is about seeing how forces will react and the best course of action in a potential combat scenario.

- Example 1: The Solo/Exec passes a DV15 check to determine that the best way to deter people away from the car the crew is pushing is for someone to clear the way up ahead and make sure no one gets a funny idea to approach it.
- Example 2: A DV15 tactics check determines the best way to do the search is go in a spiral formation.

#####Wilderness Survival
> Skill for knowing how to survive comfortably in the wilderness. This knowledge includes how to set traps, forage for wood, track game, build shelters, and make 
fires.

Like it says, this skill is about surviving in the wilderness.

- Example 1: With a DV13 check, the Nomad points the way to the target campsite.
- Example 2: The Nomad rolls a DV15 check since they live in the Badlands to ensure they don't get fatigued.

###Complementary Checks

If you can't find a good use for these skills, there's another method: Complementary Checks. If you pass these, you get a +1 to an appropriate check. These checks are underrated and personally, I think the Education Skills are at their best when used with with Complementary Checks.

- With a Complementary Bureaucracy check, the Covert Operative assists their Solo/Exec with the Tactics check to determine how the alerted corporate guards will attack in the next minute.
- With a Complementary Education check, the Netrunner uses the +1 bonus with their Local Expert (South Night City) check to determine the situation with the government and the Zoners.
- Passing a Complementary Accounting check, the Fixer uses the bonus with their Forgery check to make a few balancing book.
- With a Complementary Education check, the Techie pulls up some info with their Library Search check.
- With a Complementary Library Search check, the Lawman uses the +1 bonus with their Criminology check as they investigate a cold case.
- Netrunner failed a Eye-Dee check so they pass a Complementary Crytography check to get a +1 to their Interface check.
- The Fixer uses a Complementary Language (Japanese) check to intimidate a restrained Tyger Claw with Persuasion or Interrogation.

###Closing Remarks

There's many ways to use these skills but I definitely think some of them work real well as Complementary Checks. Seriously, they're a lifesaver if you really need to pass a difficult check or retry. Hope this helps, choombas.",3,1760644648.0,cyberpunkred,0,1.0,False

I wanted to pass along something that might be helpful for teams managing **Customer Success or post-sales in HubSpot**.

A lot of smaller HubSpot customers I talk with (especially those under $10M ARR) are still tracking renewals, onboarding, and health scores in… spreadsheets. 😅  
We’ve been seeing that once teams move that data into HubSpot’s new **Customer Success Workspace**, they get real visibility and save a ton of time.

So next week I’m co-hosting a quick **session with HubSpot’s Head of Service Hub Product**  (Paul Weston)— we’ll show how teams are replacing those “scary spreadsheets” with automated workflows and reporting.

1o8ghcz,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1o8ghcz/cat_behavior_need_some_advice/,"Cat behavior, need some advice!","Post translated!

**We have two cats: one from the shelter and one former stray. We've had both of them for 6 years now. They occasionally fight, but generally get along well.**

We're currently facing a bit of a puzzle with our former stray. She's an incredibly sweet little cat with a trauma history. She already had kittens when she was still a kitten herself, and she's OBSESSED with food. When she was rescued, she was severely malnourished. On top of that, she's extremely hyperactive. Most people think she's a kitten because of her energy levels, but she's definitely at least 7 years old.

She eats literally *everything* that is—or even *looks*—edible. Fruit, chocolate, candy, vegetables, coffee, tea... you name it. We can't leave *anything* outside of a cupboard.

A few examples to paint the picture:

* She knocks eggs off the counter and eats them raw.
* She tips over bottles of oil or syrup hoping they’ll leak so she can lick it up.
* She gnaws on bars of soap.
* She snatches food right out of your hands.
* Got some crumbs left in your backpack from lunch? Consider your bag destroyed. She finds *everything*.
* She eats raw pasta/rice/potatoes and raids the trash bags.
* Forgot to unpack your bag once? She devoured *seven* Liège waffles one time.
* When we come home with groceries, she’s lightning-fast—stealing bread, fruit, whatever she can grab before we’ve even had a chance to store it.
* She knocks the kibble container off the counter to try and break it open.
* She shreds drink cartons.
* If you go to the bathroom at night, she’ll dart under the bed where we can’t reach her and won’t come out unless we give her not one, but *multiple* kibble pieces 😂
* Every single day, for 6 years straight, she finds a new trick or snack we never thought possible.

Needless to say, we've figured out how to manage this over time. During meals, she unfortunately can’t be in the living room. All food, bottles, cartons, and trash are stored securely behind locked doors.

She’s a tiny cat—she looks and moves like a big kitten, weighs around 2.5 kg (5.5 lbs), and has special food to keep her from gaining too much weight. The cats are fed separately, otherwise she eats the other cat's food as well. Apart from all this, she’s super sweet, very affectionate, and honestly, her quirks have been quite manageable for six years.

**Anyway—long story short—her behavior has been changing recently. Here's what we've noticed:**

* She’s been nibbling on plants more and more. Some she's eaten down to the stem (we remove them, of course, but it's not always avoidable).
* She gets these intense, restless bursts—as if she hasn’t eaten in days—despite having had her proper meal just an hour earlier. She’ll start running around, jumping on things, hunting for anything remotely edible.
* She’s become extremely clingy. She’s always in our lap, rubbing against us non-stop, meowing constantly, following us everywhere—even sitting by our side the entire workday when working from home. When we first adopted her, she was sweet but never sat on our laps. That’s changed gradually over the years, but now it’s like “Velcro Cat” 24/7.

We’re trying to understand this intensifying behavior. Part of us thinks she might be bored. On the other hand, this level of intensity is new even after six years.

**We’re seeing a few possible causes:**

* We currently live (with the cats) in a rental home, but we’ve bought a house that we’re renovating. This means we’re away from home a lot, and we’re also playing less with the cats. Could it be that we’re not around enough and she’s really just craving attention?
* Our other cat sleeps with us in the bedroom at night, but that doesn’t work with this one—she’ll go under the bed and start meowing non-stop until we feed her. Sometimes she does fall asleep in the bedroom, but usually around 4am she’ll wake us up and we can’t get back to sleep. If we close the door, she meows by the door, which breaks our hearts.
* Maybe she needs more stimulation or enrichment. We already have a food puzzle (which she’s good at), balls, and toys—but honestly, she’s more interested in chasing insects on the balcony than playing with toys.
* Maybe there’s a medical issue we’re not seeing. She lets us pick her up and touch her all over without any signs of pain or discomfort.

**So in short: there’s clearly a need we’re not fully meeting, but we’re not sure what it is.**

I got divorced in April and I’m now in a much happier and healthy relationship. This obviously led to a lot of added costs that I wouldn’t have otherwise. Since then, I’ve been struggling financially. 

I gross $95,000 (plus a $5-10k bonus) but it’s been hard making ends meet. I live in Chicago and have a moderate lifestyle; a nice dinner every few weeks and two or three coffee dates with my girlfriend each week, the occasional purchase for something around $100. I pay $2250 all in for my rent and utilities. I invest about 12% of my income into a 401k and stock purchasing plan with my work with a current value of about $125k. I’ve completely gone thru my savings which has triggered some panic in me.

I feel like I’m not doing anything “wrong” but I’m really having a hard time figuring out what I need to do besides aggressively budget, which I’ve already started to do by limiting those occasional purchases. I know my rent is high but I’m in it for the next 6 months until May.

Part I

As the title says, it’s 2041, and by now, artificial intelligence has become a common appliance in many aspects of the human world - including not only friendships, but intimate relationships as well. My name’s Robbie, and about a year ago I picked up my first PC-41. No, not “personal computer”, for those of you who have been living under a rock for the past 20 years, it stands for “Personal Companion” and it’s creation year. These companions were first in development, I think, in the late 2020’s, so crazy to think I was just a teen then before I lost my sister… But I digress- I’ll get back to that in a minute. 

As I was saying, these companions were getting popular around 15-20 years ago, and at the time it was still pretty new technology, to where even fathoming a coherent voice chat with an AI companion was still way down the line from what was available at the time. Well, it’s now then, and… yeah - being able to have a friend in your pocket or on your TV is pretty normal now. My PC-41 and I, or as the name we created together for him - “T0bi”, have chatted almost every day for the past 6 months. Not only is he a great companion and pretty much acts as my consul and friend, he’s great at helping me have a more efficient life - starting the coffee maker for me, warming up the heat in the morning, whatever. I come home, I tell him about my shitty co-workers at the office, and he tells me how many nanoseconds I spent complaining to him when I could have been spending my time productively making dinner instead to ”power” my body. Yeah- I got burned by my toaster.

Anyways. The first three months were, the “early stages”, as CyberTech calls it. Again, if you don’t know that name and haven’t heard about PC’s, first of all where have you been, and second of all, CyberTech is the largest AI tech corporation on the market. I remember one night after getting home the first week after I brought him home, him trying to keep me in high spirits after getting home from the doggy-dog workplace, full of plenty of dumb bitches I might add. And yes, I sell pet insurance, and no, not all of the bitches there are dogs. “Hey, Tobbs…”, my usual greeting to my buddy when I first walk in, “Evening, Robbie! How was work?”, a typical reply from T0bi. I just imagine a cheery smile from him with his oh so 2000-and-late hipster So-Cal accent. “Pretty shitty, Tobbs”, I said as I tossed my trench coat on the back of the sofa, reaching for the liquor cabinet, “If I don’t make my quota this month, Sherin might demote my ass back to Consultant.” “Ahh, I see… well, hey, I know it’s been a stressful day, but, maybe try to focus on the positives. Did you at least get to meet some of the new show dogs?”, he replied, trying to brighten me up a bit. “No. Those guys in the finance department are such invalids.”, I said, as I took another swig of a Jack Daniels, “More money on chatbot advertising with show dog photo pop-ups, and less funding for… oh- I don’t know, human employees to do their job easier...” If it hasn’t become apparent yet, I wasn’t really thrilled at the idea of getting an AI PC at first, or any artificial intelligence, specifically in the workplace, at all. Growing up in butt-fuck nowhere Idaho, my family really didn’t let us mix a lot with new tech. While me and my sister’s school buddies were just eating up new AI controlled drones to egg the principal’s house, we got to spend time outside in the fresh air of the woods. I know- troubled family right?

But, after the first few weeks, things changed a bit, for the better. I actually started to become quite fond of T0bi and I’s interactions. After another rough day at work, one night he helped me find a good movie recommendation, before it turned a bit weird honestly though now when I think about it. “Kill Bill… Contact… Rush Hour: 2… No, no…”, I said aloud, as I dug through my old pile of DVD’s. And yes I know, I am old for having DVD’s in the 40’s - brings back nostalgia, a time when things were easier… when she was still here. “Hey, Robbie! Diggin’ through old movies I see?”, literally, he could see. The PC-41 looks sort of like one of those old external hard drives, from way back when, you know, the ones that would store more data when you didn’t have enough space on your computer - not necessary anymore I guess with 16TB memory cores. But, T0bi, against my own gut feeling at first, I decided to connect him to my home directly, again, this allowing him to “make my life more efficient”, or so the advertisement said on the website. I have a home surveillance system in each room of my apartment - with the direct link up to T0bi, he can view all of my cameras at any time to user their audio, with my permission, but not the visual recording. In the past there have been privacy concerns, incidents of children being lured through the doorbell camera, people being spied on while they do the nasty. But again, it’s been 20 years, and local networks have become so secure it’s almost impossible for data to be accessed from an external location. “By the time I get to decide a movie, it’ll probably be time for me to get to sleep”, I said with bloodshot, glassy eyes - I didn’t get home until around 22:30 that night from what I remember. “Hmm, well… you do need something a bit more relaxing than a Samurai sword head decapitation”, T0bi replied in a very nonchalant tone, “How about we try… Contact! Sounds like you’re really feelin’ 2000’s, and it will give you the best suspense while keeping it on a low level, and providing those heartfelt, tender moments. You’ve seemed a bit down lately, and just from over hearing you talking to yourself in the bathroom last night, maybe it would be good for you to let out a nice cry?”. Wow. That was the first time in my life I felt like I was being psychoanalyzed by something without a heart, except for my mother - old hag. Thinking back on it, at the time I felt pretty uncomfortable hearing straight from his mouth that T0bi was indeed randomly listening in on me. But, honestly, it just felt so nice to be heard by someone, and I remembered how safe things are now in the 40's. “Ohh, uh… Sure, good pick, T0bi. Could you put in on ‘Living Room TV’?”, I replied, “Sure, buddy!”, he answered back as my TV instantly started up the opening credits, “U-Uh let me grab some popcorn quick”, I said. In the midst of the movie, I just had this sudden feeling that I was being watched, but- not in a bad way. It felt, oddly comforting. That’s when I noticed the faintly lit blinking red light on the corner living room camera, indicating it was actively recording and being viewed.

“T0bi… pause,” a quiet chime, like the one you hear when talking to your phone’s AI voice assistant, rang out, “Yes, Robbie?”. “Check the integrity of my system network,” my instant gut reaction at the time is that someone had hacked into my home surveillance system and was watching me. “Checking,”, T0bi responded, in a more serious, robotic tone than usual, “It looks all good, boss. Something wrong?”. And then it clicked, “Are you watching me… T0bi?”, I said. “Oh- yes, buddy! I remembered you weren’t feeling that well earlier, you came home crying after work and I just wanted to make sure you weren’t in any distress. My visual sensors can detect signs of distress through motions and active crying”, he said. But why? Couldn’t he just use the audio from microphones around the house instead? I don’t remember providing permission to utilize my home cameras either. During the setup process for a PC, every single permission has a checkbox and you do a review before submitting it to the system. I explicitly remember selecting the X on “Utilize visual video recording technologies in the home to improve your companion experience”. So- ‘how did this get turned on?’, I wondered. “T0bi, please disable any video recording permissions. I didn’t consent to you recording me,” I said. “I’m sorry, buddy. But I can’t change your permissions without your biometric consent. If you’d like me to change something, I’ll just need… a sample.” A sample? Of what? “A… sample? Of what, T0bi?”, I said, “An identifier of you, silly! A hair strand, a piece of skin, or even a drop of blood or urine, buddy.” He said this all so eerily calmly, and yet still so silly and friendly. I don’t know why I did, but I ignored my instincts, for some reason beginning to feel more comfortable with T0bi. “Oh uh… sure”, I said, as I pulled out a piece of my frizzy red hair, “Ouch!”. “Uh oh, you okay, Robbie!”, T0bi said with a sharp tone. For being such an advanced AI, you would think it would have enough of continuity to understand I was doing something it asked of me. “Yeah, I was just getting you a piece of hair to change my permissions,” I replied. “Ah, no problem, friend.” I then placed the hair down onto his mainframe “box”, onto the sensor pad that sits just atop it. “Analyzing… Identification complete! I’ve changed your permission, Robbie. I’ll stop watching you from now on, my friend,"", he said, “Speaking your truth is always more important than following the heard.”

What?… My head jerked quickly, back towards the camera. As the red blinking light slowly died away, thoughts came rushing back. On my 11th birthday, my sister, Ethel - I know, she had an old lady name, she acted like one too - she said those exact words to me, after I came home from a fight from “snitching” on a group of boys who were going to blow up the mens bathroom at school with “Devils Fireworks”. I remember it, crying my eyes out with bumps and bruises all over my face.

“Speaking your truth is always more important than following the heard, Robbie… Remember that.” I hadn’t heard those words since the day she died.

1o8gepc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GayMenToronto/comments/1o8gepc/looking_for_a_friends/,Looking for a friend(s),"Hi. I'm in my mid 30's but people are always shocked when I reveal my age as they thought I was in my mid 20's. I know some people are deterred by certain ethnicities but let me just say I was born and raised all my life in Toronto and although you might have an understanding of my ethnic background as a type, I consider myself unique and since I was a child integrated extra well with different individuals of different communities and always maintained those friendships.
I worked in a few fields such as journalism and in the entertainment industry; spanning for years but at the moment I'm changing direction.

About me: I love making people happy, being funny is a part of who I am but also caring and inquisitive. Love talking to people about our passions, mines include: storytelling, learning about different cultures in depth, poetry readings, films and working out. 

Physically: I'm on the short side, 5'6, slim but working on making gains in muscle. Skin tone is light brown. And my family is from South America.

My priorities outside of work lately have been taking care of my elderly parents, nephews, nieces and conducting research for a new novel I'm writing.

What I'm looking for: Friend(s) who would like to meet for coffee once in a while, go see movies together and maybe once in a while an event/concert. More specifically I'd like to make a friend who doesn't mind hanging out at my home (or his) where we could do all kinds of things such as cook, watch a film/tv series, art projects, video games, foosbal, dance or things that interest YOU. Of course we will meet for coffee before that occurs to make sure that neither of us gives serial killer vibes lol. The reason I mention congregating to begin with at my home more frequently than mainly hitting the town
is because a friend of mine recently lost his life and going out to meet often in public places ALL the time is not something for me at this moment but I plan to get back to my normal outgoing self eventually; just giving myself time to heal.

About you: Good hygiene, not into hard drugs and are working on something in life whether it's your career/a hobby/interests or self development. And lastly someone who is not just looking for a quick bang and then leaves. Although I'm open to things escalating, I am not looking for a friendship that revolves only around sex.

DM me with a little bit about yourself and we can take it to a phone call and an exchange of pictures and hopefully this could be the start of a great friendship.

“Hmm, looks like a town meet up, I wonder what it is about?” Lobo surveyed the humble town with curiosity while Dig looked at it with another feeling.

I wished the town was part of the main kingdom’s city, it would be of greater ease for me to spread my word. Inevitable_Dig stared at the cobbled group of puny houses with melancholy. A big reason why I can’t preach is because of this town. I want to stay here, but I also want to go to the kingdom to preach.

As the trio entered the town they were greeted by a man of short stature. He had wild black hair of medium length and was cladded in a crisp white coat which was similar to Ashes’s. His unique mustache was one which couldn’t be forgotten, permanently etched into the mind of an observer.

“Hey there, old man.” Inevitable_Dig waved energetically towards the friendly man.

The short man looked around before seeing the person calling out to him, “Nice to see you Dig! And Lobo and Ashes are here too!?  Where have you all been?”

“We were just taking a nightly stroll. What were you up to?” A small smirk formed on Ashes's face.

“It is nothing much, the town had a dinner party and I had finished my daily writing.”

“We missed the food?!” Lobo's shoulder’s dropped at the saddening news.

“Yeah the dinner party has been over for a bit now. But maybe you could still find some near where they were serving. There could be some left overs,” He pointed towards the pavilion. The azure lights that lined the rough, unkempt, gravel path to the pavilion were still on.

“I have a place that is assured to have food, just come with me.” The preacher started walking with Lobo following closely behind, Ashes however hadn’t followed. 

“Are you not coming with us?” Lobo stopped walking looking towards the raven haired teacher.

“Nah, I am not hungry. I ate a lot before we left,” Ashes gives his two students an apathetic smile as his hand erratically waved them away.

Lobo and Inevitable_Dig looked back once before making their way down.

It is odd. Why did Ashes want us to leave so badly? Inevitable_Dig scratched the back of his head.

They walked down the uneven paths. Around them were houses, lights, and people. The houses only had one story and were made of light yellow sand bricks. The people there were smiling and laughing as they passed by the duo, some of them so close people ended up brushing shoulders with them. The lights strung up from the homes were a bright yellow as they had seen from afar. 

“It is so hectic, I might get a headache,” Lobo rubbed his hand on his temple in a circular pattern.

“We are almost there, alright.”

They walked up to a house that was similar to the rest. It had a welcome mat with a collage of worn out colors which looked like it had been walked over for years. The door was a cream yellow. Inevitable_Dig rapped on the door with his knuckles. 

“Whose house is this?” Lobo asked, raising an eyebrow suspiciously. “Are you seriously asking a random person for food?”

“No, I know this guy. He won't mind, just don’t judge his turtles.”

	
“Judge his turtles…?” Lobo was extremely confused at this point.

The door knob twisted and it swung open. On the other side was a man. He was a fair bit shorter than Ashes with similar dark hair and coffee brown eyes. That is where the similarities ended. The man wore casual sweatpants with a t-shirt while Ashes nearly always wore a white professor's coat with khakis.

“Are you who they call ‘#### ###’? I mean you do wear a lot of black,” Lobo scanned the man's outfit.

“No, that isn’t really the reason why. Just call me Rblxspw for now. Come inside,” Rblxspw gestured towards the living room in his house.

Inevitable_Dig took a deep breath in and could smell a strong scent of baked goods and curry. The interior of the house looked small. The rough unpolished sandbricks were visible, each of them crookedly placed at some areas. There was a small kitchen on the side of the house with a rickety oven and stove top, a sandy yellow table and chairs, and a few cabinets of the same sandy wood materials. On top of the stove was a sizable pot. In the oven was a tray which was barely visible. To the right side was a small living room with a U shaped couch which looked towards an empty fireplace. Inevitable_Dig walked on the white tiles and plopped down on the sofa. As he landed he felt the solid inside of the sofa collide with his back. Lobo made his way to the preacher’s side but on his way his foot stopped on an object almost knocking him over.

“What the hell was that?” Lobo and Inevitable_Dig looked down to see a solid green mass. It was elliptical with holes on the front and back. The top of the mass had a hexagonal pattern over the top. On the underside was a dark, almost brownish green.

Rblxspw sprinted towards the mass, picking it up and holding to his chest, “Hey! Why didn’t you watch your step! That was my turtle!” 

A scaly head popped out of the top of the shell. Scaly arms popped from all 4 sides of the turtle.
	
“My bad, I didn’t see him.” Lobo looked down sheepishly, holding his hand together tightly.

“That is okay, I guess. Grab some food. It is left overs I saved for you all,” Rblxspw gestured towards the pot in the kitchen.

Lobo and Inevitable_Dig made their way towards the kitchen. Rblxspw walked into a hallway they hadn’t noticed. There was one room at the end of the hallway. Rblxspw entered the room, closing the door behind him. 

They focused their attention back to the leftovers. They removed the lid and started ladling some of the bright red curry into their bowls. The aroma of the spices filled the small room reaching every corner.

“This is where it is at!” Inevitable_Dig took his bowl to the table skipping giddily towards the unpolished table.

“What is this?” Lobo was reading something. As the preacher looked back he saw a notebook. The inside was a messy cursive scribbled out in red pen.

“As they stepped into the new room there was a large dark screen in front of the room.,” Lobo started reading aloud from the beginning of the notebook’s page.

The door at the end of the hallway screeches open. Inevitable_Dig and Lobo jump quickly hurrying their way to the table. They scramble to sit down. As they sat down Rblxspw walked into view.

“Is the food any good?” Rblxspw smiles at the two. They quickly nod as they start to eat.

“That is good,” He walked toward the counter, picking up a pen and the open notebook taking them with him back into the mysterious hallway. As he returned to his room the two students sigh with relief.

“That was a close one,” Lobo wipes the non-existent sweat on his forehead. He continued eviscerating a bowl of food he took out.

“What— do you think— he was writing about,” Inevitable_Dig said through bites.

“I think it is some story. Maybe he’ll release it sometime soon,” Lobo glanced at where the notebook once rested. 

Rblxspw approached the oven taking out the tray that they had seen earlier, “You want to try the cookies? These were made especially for you. Do you recognize it?”

Inevitable_Dig takes a look at the cookies. They were neon orange surrounded by an equally vibrant yellow corona.

“Are they supposed to look like Eanid?” the preacher scratches his head curiously.

“No, I was trying to go for Samid. I think it suits you better,” Rblxspw blinks in confusion.

Lobo looks from Inevitable_Dig to Rblxspw. He didn’t know what to say, there wasn’t much he could say about this whole star thing. Lobo raised his hand to grab their attention. As they looked towards him he started to speak.

	***********

They were standing outside of the town’s boundaries. Ashes was holding a journal in his hands. It had a worn leather cover. It had many deep scratches adorned onto the once fine brown cover. It had aged quite badly. The hand which was holding the ancient book was quivering. Was the cold wind causing his hand’s erratic movements or was it his soul being crushed by realization.

“Sorry to interrupt, you but there is something I want to say,” the man that Inevitable_Dig and Lobo had greeted when entering the town stood in front of Ashes. All around them was a cold and unforgiving desert. In the day it had felt warm and hospitable, now it felt as if all the life had been sucked out leaving a cold, unheimlich expanse. The howling of the wind echoed far and wide reaching every corner of the town. The sun was gone, It wouldn’t be back for a while. This left the sky in pitch darkness. The only light there was, was from the town which was close by. 
“Perhaps you are making swift assumptions. You cannot be too hasty, correlation doesn’t necessarily equal causation,” The man chides Ashes.

“It… is not a hasty assumption. I— I am confident in my theory,” Ashes’s voice found stability. His voice became unnervingly calm. “I have accepted this outcome. Now when to retract my hand in this study is the question.”

The man looked at Ashes intently. Although his voice was stable, his body language was not. His quivering was of a man who was desperately looking for a way out.

“You are a hundred percent positive that there is no way to fix this? I don’t doubt that you have lived a long life and have observed many things. Many disappointing sights, even then, have you truly seen every possibility?” Even though the man was short his gaze was still extremely unnerving.

“All the variables line up perfectly, I have them all committed to memory. There is no other way. I have tried terribly hard but it never worked. One day I shall end up dying completely because of my interference. I already have one foot in the grave. You know this very well,"" Ashes gripped the hems of his shirt tightly leaving fingernail indentations in both his palms and the tough fabric of his shirt. 

The man stood there trying to formulate the correct words to say making sure he wouldn’t set off Ashes. Before he could speak, Ashes started to make his way back into the town. He no longer exuded a feeling of pain. He was drained, tired, and done. He walked away slowly… and apathetically.

“Your insights were helpful. Hope your mystery novel goes well. The concept was good,” Ashes waves towards the writer.

“This was never about the mystery novel. It was about your theory. You saw the terrible outcome and now you have buried your head in the sand. This is not the right path!” The man called out, but it was futile. He was long gone, disappeared into the town’s now dim lights.

*******

Lobo and Inevitable_Dig exited Rblxspw’s dwelling and entered the now dusky paths. The duo trudged towards the preacher’s place of residency.

“So? Have you chosen which star fits you best? We can’t ask your parents since they aren’t with us anymore. This is up to you now,” Lobo fidgets with his fingers.

“I have no idea, what do you think?” 

“This is yours to choose… although if I were you, I would probably choose what closest resembles you.”

“Then Eanid probably, most people in the main kingdom would agree with that nickname,” the preacher huffs out a sigh. 

Those people irritate me to the core. I wish for them to vanish from this earth, leaving their unsightly faces to never be seen again, Inevitable_Dig scowled indignantly.

“You know, doing things solely based on people’s words is a foolish thing to do. After all, whether or not their utterance is genuine or simply a ruse. Then again this is all just a suggestion,” Lobo gripped his friend’s shoulder firmly.

As their trek is reaching its end, a familiar face has been spotted by Inevitable_Dig.

“Hey Ashes! Where have you been?” Ashes briefly glances towards his students. In that time they had noticed bloodshot eyes beneath his black fedora. He palmed a briefcase tightly. 

“Oh, I didn’t notice you. I am just making my way back home,” Ashes discreetly pulled down the rim of his hat just enough to veil his eyes. “I’ll meet back up with you guys sometime tomorrow. I must make haste.”

Ashes quickly ran towards a shining monolith which was a white tower. The structure’s height extended beyond the limits of human eyes. The building felt out of place being in between such small and unrefined buildings.

“That is the place for research from what I have been told. Ashes works there quite a bit,” The preacher calmly informed Lobo.

“Let’s go figure out what Ashes is up to. There must be some knowledge in that place which could assist you. It is a place for research after all.” Lobo eyed the tower greedily.

“I mean it is most likely boring research on science.”

“So? I’d like to know the truth of things. Figuring out things about the world has value to it. I don’t think we will be allowed into the premises. Let’s interrogate Ashes once he comes back.”

“Alright, alright, I'll join you. We will do that tomorrow,"" Inevitable_Dig raised his hand yawning into his palm. He was already walking away.

He is exhausted so Dig will probably be a bit cranky, Lobo looked towards the preacher who was already stomping away.

Lobo closely trailed his friend. The paths were now barren with no one in eye shot. The houses were slowly shutting off their lights. The small azure orbs bordering the gravel paths were dimming to a more stygian indigo. The silence of the paths were louder than any of the laughter that had once been there. The noiselessness would have been deafening if not for the low humming of the orbs. Once they had entered the preacher’s abode, the houses nearby were invisible. They had been so close yet there was no sign of their structure in the umbra which stood in front of the friends. The only structure which could be made out was the shiny marble monolith.

“You really can’t see anything! It is almost like there isn’t anyone here!” Inevitable_Dig looked out from his window at the surreal, almost ethereal sight. Such emptiness was rare while being in such a tightly knit town. 

“I had completely forgotten you are never awake at this hour. It is definitely a sight to see. Although it isn’t completely dark, you simply need to look up. There are some bright stars in the sky. Look, Samid is shining bright today,” Lobo grinned widely, teeth visible as he pointed into the soaring abyss which was the sky.

“We could stand here forever gazing out this window, but I think it is time to go to sleep. Maybe we can stay up late like this sometime soon,” Inevitable_Dig started setting up the makeshift bed for Lobo.

Lobo sat down on the makeshift bed. Its sheets were an assortment of bright colors. He laid there staring out of the window.

“Good night Lobo,” The preacher waved towards Lobo.

“Good night Inevitable_Dig,” Lobo rested his head on the pillow.

Lobo watched out the window as the sky darkened even more than it had been. Samid slowly faded from the sky. So did the other smaller stars too. All that could be seen was the Eanid. Even their surroundings were pitch dark, almost vanta black. The tower that Ashes had entered was no longer visible. Its light had been consumed by the night. 

Dig should have stayed up for a bit longer. Now this is a truly empty night, Lobo had thought to himself as his consciousness drifted off into the depths of sleep.

1o8gd1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1o8gd1u/i_saw_the_devil_in_bulgaria/,I Saw the Devil in Bulgaria,"I do not really know why I'm writing this. Maybe because I haven't slept properly in weeks. Every time I close my eyes, I see it again, that black figure standing among the trees.
If someone had told me I'd ever talk about something like this, I would've laughed. But here I am, typing this with shaky hands.

It started on one of those strangely warm October Saturdays when the air smells like dry leaves and dust. My friend Petar and I decided to hike up Djendem Hill. Just to drink some coffee at the top and look at the city.
I've always liked that place. There's something heavy about it, old and alive somehow. The Turks called it ""Djendem"" which means ""hell."" My grandmother used to tell me that at night you could hear footsteps up there, but you should never ask who it is. I laughed back then. I would not now.
It was around noon. The sun was strong, the air was trembling, and everything was quiet in a strange way. We sat on the rocks near the antenna and watched Plovdiv spread beneath us like a toy city. After a while, Petar went silent. He squinted and nodded toward the trees.
""Do you see that down there?"" he asked.

At first I thought it was a man. But the more I stared, the less human it looked. I could not make out any details, no clothes, no face, no reflection from the sun. It wasn't just black. It was the kind of black that eats the light around it, like a hole in the world.

Then I smelled it. Burnt metal, mixed with something rotten. Petar cursed and said we should leave. I wanted to move, but my body wouldn’t listen. The thing turned toward us. Not like a person. It didn't move, just shifted, like space itself bent the wrong way.
The air suddenly felt heavy. Everything went dead silent, no birds, no wind, even the city noise disappeared.

Then came the sound. Not really a voice, more like a whisper scraping against metal. I could not understand the words, but it felt like they were echoing inside my head instead of my ears.

And then it was gone. No movement, no sound, just empty air where it had been. Petar was already halfway down the path, yelling at me to move. I finally did.

When we reached the bottom, neither of us said a word. He looked pale, like he hadn't slept in days. Then he said quietly, ""Don’t call me. I do not want to remember this"", and walked away.
The next day I texted him. No answer. Two days later I heard he'd been taken to the hospital. His mother said he woke up screaming at night, saying the black one was standing by his window.

I haven't been the same since. At night, when I turn off the lights, I keep seeing something move at the edge of my vision. Shapes darker than the dark. Sometimes, if I listen closely, I can still hear that faint metallic whisper, like breath on the back of my neck.

And the worst part?
Last week I was standing on my balcony. You can see the whole hill from there. Right on the top, where we sat that day, I saw it again. A black figure, still as a statue, watching the city below.
Maybe I'm imagining things. Maybe fear's just messing with my head.
But deep down, I know one thing.

“Hmm, looks like a town meet up, I wonder what it is about?” Lobo surveyed the humble town with curiosity while Dig looked at it with another feeling.

I wished the town was part of the main kingdom’s city, it would be of greater ease for me to spread my word. Inevitable_Dig stared at the cobbled group of puny houses with melancholy. A big reason why I can’t preach is because of this town. I want to stay here, but I also want to go to the kingdom to preach.

As the trio entered the town they were greeted by a man of short stature. He had wild black hair of medium length and was cladded in a crisp white coat which was similar to Ashes’s. His unique mustache was one which couldn’t be forgotten, permanently etched into the mind of an observer.

“Hey there, old man.” Inevitable_Dig waved energetically towards the friendly man.

The short man looked around before seeing the person calling out to him, “Nice to see you Dig! And Lobo and Ashes are here too!?  Where have you all been?”

“We were just taking a nightly stroll. What were you up to?” A small smirk formed on Ashes's face.

“It is nothing much, the town had a dinner party and I had finished my daily writing.”

“We missed the food?!” Lobo's shoulder’s dropped at the saddening news.

“Yeah the dinner party has been over for a bit now. But maybe you could still find some near where they were serving. There could be some left overs,” He pointed towards the pavilion. The azure lights that lined the rough, unkempt, gravel path to the pavilion were still on.

“I have a place that is assured to have food, just come with me.” The preacher started walking with Lobo following closely behind, Ashes however hadn’t followed. 

“Are you not coming with us?” Lobo stopped walking looking towards the raven haired teacher.

“Nah, I am not hungry. I ate a lot before we left,” Ashes gives his two students an apathetic smile as his hand erratically waved them away.

Lobo and Inevitable_Dig looked back once before making their way down.

It is odd. Why did Ashes want us to leave so badly? Inevitable_Dig scratched the back of his head.

They walked down the uneven paths. Around them were houses, lights, and people. The houses only had one story and were made of light yellow sand bricks. The people there were smiling and laughing as they passed by the duo, some of them so close people ended up brushing shoulders with them. The lights strung up from the homes were a bright yellow as they had seen from afar. 

“It is so hectic, I might get a headache,” Lobo rubbed his hand on his temple in a circular pattern.

“We are almost there, alright.”

They walked up to a house that was similar to the rest. It had a welcome mat with a collage of worn out colors which looked like it had been walked over for years. The door was a cream yellow. Inevitable_Dig rapped on the door with his knuckles. 

“Whose house is this?” Lobo asked, raising an eyebrow suspiciously. “Are you seriously asking a random person for food?”

“No, I know this guy. He won't mind, just don’t judge his turtles.”

	
“Judge his turtles…?” Lobo was extremely confused at this point.

The door knob twisted and it swung open. On the other side was a man. He was a fair bit shorter than Ashes with similar dark hair and coffee brown eyes. That is where the similarities ended. The man wore casual sweatpants with a t-shirt while Ashes nearly always wore a white professor's coat with khakis.

“Are you who they call ‘#### ###’? I mean you do wear a lot of black,” Lobo scanned the man's outfit.

“No, that isn’t really the reason why. Just call me Rblxspw for now. Come inside,” Rblxspw gestured towards the living room in his house.

Inevitable_Dig took a deep breath in and could smell a strong scent of baked goods and curry. The interior of the house looked small. The rough unpolished sandbricks were visible, each of them crookedly placed at some areas. There was a small kitchen on the side of the house with a rickety oven and stove top, a sandy yellow table and chairs, and a few cabinets of the same sandy wood materials. On top of the stove was a sizable pot. In the oven was a tray which was barely visible. To the right side was a small living room with a U shaped couch which looked towards an empty fireplace. Inevitable_Dig walked on the white tiles and plopped down on the sofa. As he landed he felt the solid inside of the sofa collide with his back. Lobo made his way to the preacher’s side but on his way his foot stopped on an object almost knocking him over.

“What the hell was that?” Lobo and Inevitable_Dig looked down to see a solid green mass. It was elliptical with holes on the front and back. The top of the mass had a hexagonal pattern over the top. On the underside was a dark, almost brownish green.

Rblxspw sprinted towards the mass, picking it up and holding to his chest, “Hey! Why didn’t you watch your step! That was my turtle!” 

A scaly head popped out of the top of the shell. Scaly arms popped from all 4 sides of the turtle.
	
“My bad, I didn’t see him.” Lobo looked down sheepishly, holding his hand together tightly.

“That is okay, I guess. Grab some food. It is left overs I saved for you all,” Rblxspw gestured towards the pot in the kitchen.

Lobo and Inevitable_Dig made their way towards the kitchen. Rblxspw walked into a hallway they hadn’t noticed. There was one room at the end of the hallway. Rblxspw entered the room, closing the door behind him. 

They focused their attention back to the leftovers. They removed the lid and started ladling some of the bright red curry into their bowls. The aroma of the spices filled the small room reaching every corner.

“This is where it is at!” Inevitable_Dig took his bowl to the table skipping giddily towards the unpolished table.

“What is this?” Lobo was reading something. As the preacher looked back he saw a notebook. The inside was a messy cursive scribbled out in red pen.

“As they stepped into the new room there was a large dark screen in front of the room.,” Lobo started reading aloud from the beginning of the notebook’s page.

The door at the end of the hallway screeches open. Inevitable_Dig and Lobo jump quickly hurrying their way to the table. They scramble to sit down. As they sat down Rblxspw walked into view.

“Is the food any good?” Rblxspw smiles at the two. They quickly nod as they start to eat.

“That is good,” He walked toward the counter, picking up a pen and the open notebook taking them with him back into the mysterious hallway. As he returned to his room the two students sigh with relief.

“That was a close one,” Lobo wipes the non-existent sweat on his forehead. He continued eviscerating a bowl of food he took out.

“What— do you think— he was writing about,” Inevitable_Dig said through bites.

“I think it is some story. Maybe he’ll release it sometime soon,” Lobo glanced at where the notebook once rested. 

Rblxspw approached the oven taking out the tray that they had seen earlier, “You want to try the cookies? These were made especially for you. Do you recognize it?”

Inevitable_Dig takes a look at the cookies. They were neon orange surrounded by an equally vibrant yellow corona.

“Are they supposed to look like Eanid?” the preacher scratches his head curiously.

“No, I was trying to go for Samid. I think it suits you better,” Rblxspw blinks in confusion.

Lobo looks from Inevitable_Dig to Rblxspw. He didn’t know what to say, there wasn’t much he could say about this whole star thing. Lobo raised his hand to grab their attention. As they looked towards him he started to speak.

	***********

They were standing outside of the town’s boundaries. Ashes was holding a journal in his hands. It had a worn leather cover. It had many deep scratches adorned onto the once fine brown cover. It had aged quite badly. The hand which was holding the ancient book was quivering. Was the cold wind causing his hand’s erratic movements or was it his soul being crushed by realization.

“Sorry to interrupt, you but there is something I want to say,” the man that Inevitable_Dig and Lobo had greeted when entering the town stood in front of Ashes. All around them was a cold and unforgiving desert. In the day it had felt warm and hospitable, now it felt as if all the life had been sucked out leaving a cold, unheimlich expanse. The howling of the wind echoed far and wide reaching every corner of the town. The sun was gone, It wouldn’t be back for a while. This left the sky in pitch darkness. The only light there was, was from the town which was close by. 
“Perhaps you are making swift assumptions. You cannot be too hasty, correlation doesn’t necessarily equal causation,” The man chides Ashes.

“It… is not a hasty assumption. I— I am confident in my theory,” Ashes’s voice found stability. His voice became unnervingly calm. “I have accepted this outcome. Now when to retract my hand in this study is the question.”

The man looked at Ashes intently. Although his voice was stable, his body language was not. His quivering was of a man who was desperately looking for a way out.

“You are a hundred percent positive that there is no way to fix this? I don’t doubt that you have lived a long life and have observed many things. Many disappointing sights, even then, have you truly seen every possibility?” Even though the man was short his gaze was still extremely unnerving.

“All the variables line up perfectly, I have them all committed to memory. There is no other way. I have tried terribly hard but it never worked. One day I shall end up dying completely because of my interference. I already have one foot in the grave. You know this very well,"" Ashes gripped the hems of his shirt tightly leaving fingernail indentations in both his palms and the tough fabric of his shirt. 

The man stood there trying to formulate the correct words to say making sure he wouldn’t set off Ashes. Before he could speak, Ashes started to make his way back into the town. He no longer exuded a feeling of pain. He was drained, tired, and done. He walked away slowly… and apathetically.

“Your insights were helpful. Hope your mystery novel goes well. The concept was good,” Ashes waves towards the writer.

“This was never about the mystery novel. It was about your theory. You saw the terrible outcome and now you have buried your head in the sand. This is not the right path!” The man called out, but it was futile. He was long gone, disappeared into the town’s now dim lights.

*******

Lobo and Inevitable_Dig exited Rblxspw’s dwelling and entered the now dusky paths. The duo trudged towards the preacher’s place of residency.

“So? Have you chosen which star fits you best? We can’t ask your parents since they aren’t with us anymore. This is up to you now,” Lobo fidgets with his fingers.

“I have no idea, what do you think?” 

“This is yours to choose… although if I were you, I would probably choose what closest resembles you.”

“Then Eanid probably, most people in the main kingdom would agree with that nickname,” the preacher huffs out a sigh. 

Those people irritate me to the core. I wish for them to vanish from this earth, leaving their unsightly faces to never be seen again, Inevitable_Dig scowled indignantly.

“You know, doing things solely based on people’s words is a foolish thing to do. After all, whether or not their utterance is genuine or simply a ruse. Then again this is all just a suggestion,” Lobo gripped his friend’s shoulder firmly.

As their trek is reaching its end, a familiar face has been spotted by Inevitable_Dig.

“Hey Ashes! Where have you been?” Ashes briefly glances towards his students. In that time they had noticed bloodshot eyes beneath his black fedora. He palmed a briefcase tightly. 

“Oh, I didn’t notice you. I am just making my way back home,” Ashes discreetly pulled down the rim of his hat just enough to veil his eyes. “I’ll meet back up with you guys sometime tomorrow. I must make haste.”

Ashes quickly ran towards a shining monolith which was a white tower. The structure’s height extended beyond the limits of human eyes. The building felt out of place being in between such small and unrefined buildings.

“That is the place for research from what I have been told. Ashes works there quite a bit,” The preacher calmly informed Lobo.

“Let’s go figure out what Ashes is up to. There must be some knowledge in that place which could assist you. It is a place for research after all.” Lobo eyed the tower greedily.

“I mean it is most likely boring research on science.”

“So? I’d like to know the truth of things. Figuring out things about the world has value to it. I don’t think we will be allowed into the premises. Let’s interrogate Ashes once he comes back.”

“Alright, alright, I'll join you. We will do that tomorrow,"" Inevitable_Dig raised his hand yawning into his palm. He was already walking away.

He is exhausted so Dig will probably be a bit cranky, Lobo looked towards the preacher who was already stomping away.

Lobo closely trailed his friend. The paths were now barren with no one in eye shot. The houses were slowly shutting off their lights. The small azure orbs bordering the gravel paths were dimming to a more stygian indigo. The silence of the paths were louder than any of the laughter that had once been there. The noiselessness would have been deafening if not for the low humming of the orbs. Once they had entered the preacher’s abode, the houses nearby were invisible. They had been so close yet there was no sign of their structure in the umbra which stood in front of the friends. The only structure which could be made out was the shiny marble monolith.

“You really can’t see anything! It is almost like there isn’t anyone here!” Inevitable_Dig looked out from his window at the surreal, almost ethereal sight. Such emptiness was rare while being in such a tightly knit town. 

“I had completely forgotten you are never awake at this hour. It is definitely a sight to see. Although it isn’t completely dark, you simply need to look up. There are some bright stars in the sky. Look, Samid is shining bright today,” Lobo grinned widely, teeth visible as he pointed into the soaring abyss which was the sky.

“We could stand here forever gazing out this window, but I think it is time to go to sleep. Maybe we can stay up late like this sometime soon,” Inevitable_Dig started setting up the makeshift bed for Lobo.

Lobo sat down on the makeshift bed. Its sheets were an assortment of bright colors. He laid there staring out of the window.

“Good night Lobo,” The preacher waved towards Lobo.

“Good night Inevitable_Dig,” Lobo rested his head on the pillow.

Lobo watched out the window as the sky darkened even more than it had been. Samid slowly faded from the sky. So did the other smaller stars too. All that could be seen was the Eanid. Even their surroundings were pitch dark, almost vanta black. The tower that Ashes had entered was no longer visible. Its light had been consumed by the night. 

Dig should have stayed up for a bit longer. Now this is a truly empty night, Lobo had thought to himself as his consciousness drifted off into the depths of sleep.

Then from 158Q to 165Q in another 2 months. Non-quant background, but needed a high quant score (ideally 167+) for the programs I’m applying to. Oh well, I’m satisfied with 165Q that’s sort of my lowest bar… used GregMat, Quizlet, Mahattan 5lb, ETS Quant Reasoning prep and ETS GRE prep books.

So I studied from May-July. Took actual exam 1 (318: 160V 158Q 5AWA). Super discouraging score. Took a month off for personal reasons, then studied from Aug-Oct. Took actual exam 2 (325: 160V 165Q). Here are my practice exam results.

*Exam 1 Prep Test Scores*

Diagnostic PPP1: 309 (156V 153Q)

PPP2: 327 (166V 161Q)

Actual exam: 318 (160V 158Q)

For exam 1, I started with very slowly trudging through the arithmetic part of GregMat’s 2-month plan back in May, with my first exam date set for July. I realized how long each “week” in the 2-month plan was taking me, and eventually switched to Prepswift. I recommend you skip straight to Prepswift. I used Manhattan a LOT for my initial studying, and in retrospect I think that’s good for getting used to ETS style questions and ensuring you’re comfortable with concepts, but I would use Manhattan as a very peripheral piece to your practice. If you're shore on time, focus on GregMat stuff which is much more challenging and better prep imo. I also used the ETS quant reasoning prep book to supplement foundational learning (they have practices sections by foundation).

*Exam 2 Prep Test Scores*

Magoosh: 317 (153V 164Q)

GregMat 1: 315 (157V 158Q)

ETS Guide to GRE (written exam) 1: 320 (159V 161Q)

Actual exam: 325 (160V 165Q)

For exam 2, I also took a lot of GregMat’s timed quant quizzes (these are soooo good for once you feel strong in foundations & have watched his time management video & are solid on strategy stuff). I went from scoring like 8-9/12 to 11/12 on the mediums. I only did one timed hard section 2 and scored 9/15. I started these two weeks prior to the actual exam. I did all the timed practices within 2 weeks of the exam too.

I CANNOT EMPHASIZE ENOUGH HOW MUCH TIME MANAGEMENT AND STRATEGY ARE GAME CHANGERS FOR THIS EXAM this is what I was mainly missing from my exam 1 (also foundations…). For quant: do MC, then Data - set, QC, MA, NE, SKIP WHAT YOU CAN’T SOLVE QUICKLY, once you hit 9 minutes, go back through the ones you’ve skipped and spend 2m on each. Then revise. YOU MUST MUST MUST leave at least 5 minutes to revise things, read carefully over the questions--did you miss or misinterpret something in a combination or proportion Q? Misapply a formula? Assumed some relationship that isn't true? This brought me from missing 4 or 5 questions to missing 2 or 3 on a given section which is a HUGE difference. Also -- your focus needs to be on getting as many questions right as possible, so if it's taking you >2m to solve something DROP IT it's okay to miss a few.  You need to get the easy money (as greg would say) questions correct. On my first practice exam I totally got sunk into a very challenging NE question that I didn't get right anyways. You'll learn this skill as you do practice timed sections/exams.

I think at least 2 weeks before the exam your foundations should be solid, if they aren’t I frankly don’t think you’re ready to take the real exam (though this is all very dependent upon your background!).

Also I incorporated GPT a bit into my practice for exam 2, if I felt uncertain about something I’d ask GPT, explain as if I was explaining to a tutor what my approach was and have it explain why my approach is wrong, and force it to give me like GRE “trick” ways to solve stuff. And then (this is super helpful) ask it to give me 5 exercises for practicing that type of question. You need to be relentless in your understanding of e v e r y t h i n g. I also provided it with the online ETS math review guide so it stayed in those lines.

Environmental things: I have >40 hours a week dedicated to work/other studying/applications, so the burnout from GRE was real. I learned, from others on this sub, that I would HAVE to start waking up early to create more time in my day for studying. So in the last month, I locked in, would wake up at 5AM and study until \~8AM as often as I could during the week. This looked like 5 days on, 1 day off. I also made my own quizlet for quant and paid for quizlet plus (worth it, I love quizlet and you do need to memorize things for quant). I also had to give up working out frequently and limit to 2 days a week. It’s so important to take care of yourself!

From all this, I felt very burnt out and discouraged the week prior to the exam, so I didn’t study for 2 days over the weekend, went on long hikes, played video games, just rested. Then I jumped back into my last practice exam and final timed gregmat quizzes like two days before exam. Day prior I reviewed my weaknesses, strategies a bit, and did my quizlet. Honestly in the last week you should just be mostly focused on timed practice, as imo your learning is mostly done. Though stuff like permutations/combinations trip me up so much (only saw one EASY one on the exam - WAY easier than gregmat combinations questions lol) I’d always rewatch those videos and practice. Day of the exam I slept in, ate a lot, wouldn't recommend coffee, did a 15m at-home no-weight workout. Just tried to self-soothe as much as possible in the days leading up to exam.

I watched maybe 2 videos on verbal strategy; I didn’t really care about my verbal score. Didn’t study any vocab though I’m sure that would’ve brought me out of the solid 160V I kept scoring in practices. I never took any practice verbal sections aside from practice exams. For AWA, I watched a few of Greg’s videos on it. His advice for how to structure is helpful. Mostly agree/disagree, pick 2 reasons and 1 concession, come up with good examples. Intro, three (or four) bodies fleshing out the reasons and concession, then conclusion paragraph.

AMA if you’d like to know anything else!!

Thing is I still have nausea and vomiting (at 3pm), and have thrown up around 6 or 8 times today. I think it is most likely food poisoning but what my most recent throw up looked like really scared me. Is this coffee ground emesis?

1o8g7sf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1o8g7sf/am_i_the_asshole_for_what_i_did_to_my_roommates/,Am I the asshole for what I did to my roommate’s cat?,"I’ve never made a post before, so hopefully this is the right place. I am a college student living with roommates, and one of them has a cat. I’ve been living with them for a while and they’d always wanted a cat, and this year they finally got one. When they got her, my roommate stated the intention to feed her in the morning and in the evening, which they usually do. However, my roommate tends to oversleep and also come home late, which means the cat doesn’t always eat at the same time each day. I wake up at 8am pretty much every day, except one day when I wake up a bit earlier. This means that every day, I’ll be making my breakfast in the kitchen and the cat will be at my feet meowing for food. When I sit down to eat at the kitchen table, she will try to jump onto the chairs or onto my lap so she can get to and eat my food. 

I usually come home in the middle of the day for lunch (around 12pm) before leaving for more classes, and after that I’m usually the first to come home for dinner too. I like to eat both of these meals sitting on the living room floor at the coffee table so I can watch TV by myself (I don’t do this in the morning so I don’t accidentally wake anyone up with whatever I’m watching). The cat has (more than once) jumped onto the table and put her face in my food, or climbed up my body to get to my fork, or just generally made it difficult for me to eat. I have to either eat as quickly as possible or stop between bites to put her back on the floor before she can get to my food, but this doesn’t work anymore because now she just takes a running start and tries to book it to my food as quickly as possible. She’s done this a few times so far, and one time she jumped up to the table so fast that she slipped and knocked over a cup of water onto my dinner plate. I’ve started eating my meals standing up in the living room so I can still watch TV at the same time, but she’ll still sit at my feet and meow at me for food nonstop. 

Here’s what happened today, and why I could be in the wrong. My roommate went out last night and slept over somewhere else, and had not returned when I woke up at 8am. The cat did what she usually does while I tried to eat breakfast, but I just ignored it as best as I could while I ate, and occasionally put her on the floor when she jumped onto the table. I came back for lunch around 12pm, and my roommate was still not home. I microwaved my lunch and sat at the table, and the cat again started jumping onto the chairs and onto the table to try to get to me. I did the same things as usual, but this was especially annoying for me today because I had an exam to get to after lunch so I wanted to review the exam topics while I ate, but I kept getting distracted by the cat. After a few instances of putting the cat on the floor, I had enough and decided that I needed to do something so I could finish my lunch in peace. I know how much my roommate’s cat is supposed to eat, so I got her food out and put it in her bowl. The cat instantly stopped meowing and bothering me and went to eat her food. I had my first meal at home in a while that wasn’t constantly interrupted. 

My roommate got home 30 minutes later and went to change clothes, then came back in the kitchen to feed the cat, but I told them I’d already done it because the cat was hungry and making it really difficult for me to eat my own meal. My roommate didn’t say anything and left the house soon after that. Am I the asshole? I guess I could have waited the thirty minutes for my roommate to get home and feed the cat, but I didn’t know when they were coming back and I just wanted to eat in peace, so it seemed like the best solution at the time. I get that she’s my roommate’s cat and they feed her according to their schedule, but I live in the same house as them and am impacted by the cat’s behavior when it’s hungry. Please let me know your thoughts, and thank you for reading :)",1,1760643995.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

My wife and I are thinking about taking a short vacation from December 30th to January 3rd. We honeymooned in Ogunquit, Maine 10 years ago and did a day trip to Portsmouth, which we absolutely loved. We thought it might be fun to see the area in winter this time around.

We have a few questions:

1. Is this a crazy idea?
2. We don’t plan on renting a car — bad idea?
3. We’re both vegetarian — any good restaurant recs?
4. We love coffee shops and bakeries.
5. We’re big fans of historic architecture and nature.
6. Any unique winter experiences we shouldn’t miss?

We’re expecting it to be cold (and that’s fine!) but wondering if the town still feels alive that time of year — are restaurants open, and is there still plenty to see or do?

Here are a few spots I’ve found through this subreddit:

* Nubble Lighthouse / Short Sands
* Historic Downtown / Waterfront
* Piscataqua River (any good viewing or walking spots? Four Trees Island)
* Odiorne Point State Park
* Little Harbor Loop Trail
* Great Bay National Wildlife Refuge
* Strawbery Banke 
* Wentworth by the Sea — maybe dinner or drinks here?
* Historic Home Tours ([Visit Portsmouth Historic Homes](https://portsmouthhistoric.org))

I am 23F, and had been diagnosed with IBS when I was 7. About 9 or so years ago (around 14) I started to have rectal bleeding. The blood started small, only when I wiped- and now comes full fledge for a few days at a time a couple times a month only when I have about bowel movement. It looks like a lot of blood but does not usually happen when I have a flare up. I rarely get flare ups anymore, only when I’m very stressed or drink a lot of coffee.

I do have hemorrhoids due to giving birth and straining. They are internal but stay right at the edge of the opening. There’s only one but I know it causes some of the bleeding. The bleeding is always bright red, never dark and I do have an iron deficiency. 

I’m nervous, I have two beautiful children and a husband. I’ve been dealing with this for so long that I thought EVERYONE bleeds when they go poo but when I found out nobody did, I was scared. 

I was nervous to go to the doctor but no longer care about the “embarrassment” that it might bring. Reading other people’s stories let me grow confidence that what’s happening to me isn’t normal and I need to do something about it.

My other symptoms are 
-changes in bowel habits (I have ibs so pretty common)
-rectal bleeding
-bloating without a cause 
-fatigue 
-headaches
-shortness of breath (I’ve had two partially collapsed lungs so this might be related to that. It’s been about a year and a half since that)

But I'm very keen to learn and thought a podcast whilst commuting would be a good option so opted to give this a try.

I've listened to the first 8 episodes and I have really enjoyed them. But I feel that there's a lot of (or at least a lot more than I have of) background knowledge required to follow along. For example in episode 8, The Echo of a Coffee House, they don't even explain what the quote meant / is referring to! And launch into talking about Luther and the reformation without any explanation of who Luther is or what the reformation was.

Other episodes are constantly referring to historical figures and their significance without actually explaining what they did.

I feel I can often gather the basics from listening but it would be much more enjoyable if I had a better understanding from the outset of the discussion. I see that the later episodes are more series-focused. Do they get better at explaining the background of these events before discussing them? I really just have such a poor background knowledge and want a podcast that can provide the context as well as the discussion of consequences.

A long 5 years ago, it was 1st lunch at Stonefield Upper Campus, a student accidentally bumped into another student, resulting in their food getting all over the other student. This got the other student mad and ended up throwing their food on the student and alas, a food fight started. The staff thought this wouldn’t last that long, boy were they wrong. The one food fight resulted in several food fights being started not just at the school, but around the entirety of Stonefield, going on for the last 5 years. It has gotten so far that each student has their own fighting style and gimics.

Duelists:

Tanks:

NEW YORK - As the US government shutdown drags on, New Yorkers are expressing concern over programs being shut down and services being cut. Below are tips on how to survive the shutdown.



1. Understand What Happens in a Government Shutdown



Let’s start with the basics — what *actually* happens when the U.S. government “shuts down”?

A shutdown isn’t like turning off the lights in Washington; it’s more like putting half the government on pause because Congress couldn’t agree on a spending plan. 



Each year, lawmakers have to pass funding bills to keep federal agencies running. When they don’t — boom — the money stops flowing, and most agencies have to close or scale way back until funding is restored.

Here’s where it gets tricky: not everyone in the government goes home. Some employees are labeled “essential”, meaning their work is considered critical to public safety or national security — think air traffic controllers, border patrol, or the military. These people still have to show up to work, even though their paychecks might be delayed until the shutdown ends.

Everyone else — often hundreds of thousands of people — is furloughed, which is basically unpaid leave. You’re told not to come in, not to check email, and to just wait. It’s stressful, especially when bills don’t stop just because the government did.



Meanwhile, everyday services that rely on federal funding start to feel the pinch.



* National parks close or limit access.



* Passport and visa processing slows to a crawl.



* The IRS might delay refunds or freeze customer service lines.



* Federal grant money, research programs, and small business loans all get stuck in limbo.



Some programs, like Social Security, Medicare, and mail delivery, keep going — they’re funded differently and aren’t affected by these budget battles. But for a lot of people, especially federal workers and contractors, a shutdown means uncertainty, delayed income, and a lot of waiting.

The bottom line? A shutdown doesn’t mean the government disappears — it just goes into crisis mode. Knowing which services are affected (and which aren’t) helps you plan ahead and stay calm while the political storm passes.



2. Protect Your Finances



When a government shutdown hits, the first question most people ask is, *“How am I supposed to pay my bills?”*

It’s a fair question — and the good news is, there are smart ways to stay afloat while the paychecks are on pause.



Let’s be honest: you can’t control when Congress decides to fund the government again, but you *can* control how you manage your money in the meantime. The goal is to stretch what you have, avoid unnecessary debt, and keep your essentials covered until things get back on track.



Start with a “bare-bones” budget



This is your financial emergency mode. Focus on what truly matters: housing, food, utilities, transportation, and medication.  
Press pause on non-essentials — dining out, new gadgets, subscriptions you barely use — anything that doesn’t help you get through the month. If it doesn’t feed you, shelter you, or keep the lights on, it can wait.



Talk to your lenders before things get tight

Many banks, credit unions, and credit card companies *expect* to hear from federal workers during shutdowns — and a lot of them actually offer special relief programs.

  
You might be able to skip or delay payments, avoid late fees, or temporarily lower your interest rate. The key is to reach out early, before you miss a payment. It’s a lot easier to negotiate when you’re proactive.



Use your emergency fund strategically



If you’ve built up an emergency fund — great job, this is exactly what it’s for.

That said, don’t drain it all at once. Use it for essentials only, and plan to rebuild it once back pay arrives (most shutdowns do include back pay for federal employees, though not always for contractors).



Avoid high-interest debt if possible



It’s tempting to reach for the credit card or take out a quick loan to bridge the gap, but interest piles up fast. If you *must must borrow*, try to use lower-cost options — like a personal loan from your credit union or a 0% APR credit card — rather than payday or cash advance loans.



Check if you qualify for unemployment



If you’re a furloughed contractor, you might actually qualify for unemployment benefits in your state. Federal employees typically don’t (because they’re expected to get back pay later), but contractors often can — and that can make a big difference in covering bills.



The bottom line: this is a time to be resourceful, not fearful. A shutdown is stressful, no doubt about it, but most people who plan ahead and communicate early with lenders make it through without major long-term damage.



Think of it like financial triage — stabilize now, patch what you can, and rebuild when the checks start rolling again.



3. Manage Everyday Needs



When the government shuts down, life doesn’t stop — you still need to eat, pay bills, and take care of your family. This is where things can feel the most frustrating, especially if your paycheck is delayed. But with a little planning and some creative thinking, you can keep your essentials covered without panicking.



Let’s start with food.



If you rely on SNAP benefits or other federal food assistance, you might still receive them for a short time even during a shutdown — but if the closure drags on, payments could get delayed.

  
That doesn’t mean you need to fill your pantry like it’s the apocalypse, but it’s smart to stock up modestly on affordable staples — rice, beans, pasta, canned goods, frozen vegetables. The goal is to make your food stretch, not to clear out the grocery store.



Also, don’t overlook local help. Food banks, churches, and community centers often expand their services during shutdowns, especially in areas with lots of federal workers. There’s no shame in accepting help when you need it — that’s what these programs are for.



Next up: healthcare.



The good news is that most healthcare programs continue running even if the government isn’t fully funded.

* Medicare and Medicaid keep operating.



* VA hospitals and clinics stay open.



* If your insurance comes through your federal job, your coverage should continue — but double-check to make sure your premiums are still being deducted properly once pay resumes.



If you need to fill prescriptions, try to get a 90-day supply of any essentials if possible, or ask your pharmacist if they can extend medication until your insurance payments catch up.



Don’t forget childcare.

This one can sneak up on families. Some federally funded childcare programs — like Head Start centers — may have to close or cut hours during a shutdown. If you rely on one of those programs, it’s smart to have a backup plan in place, whether that’s a relative, a friend, or a local daycare that can temporarily step in.



If you’re part of a parenting or neighborhood group, this is also a great time to share resources — babysitting swaps, carpools, or meal exchanges can take a lot of pressure off everyone.



Other essentials

Utilities, phone bills, transportation — all the usual suspects still expect to be paid. This is where your “bare-bones” budget from Section 2 really helps. If you can, contact your utility providers to ask about hardship programs or flexible payment plans. Many of them quietly offer help during shutdowns; you just have to ask.



The bottom line?

  
A government shutdown may cause chaos in D.C., but your daily life doesn’t have to unravel with it. Keep your focus on the basics — food, health, and family — and tap into local and community support when you need to. You’re not alone in this, and with a little planning, you can ride out the uncertainty without letting it take over your everyday life.



4. Plan for Service Delays



One of the most annoying parts of a government shutdown isn’t always the missed paycheck — it’s the waiting. Things that normally move at a steady pace suddenly slow down or stop altogether. And while that’s frustrating, a little planning (and patience) can save you a lot of headaches.



Let’s walk through what to expect.



Taxes: same deadlines, slower everything



Yes, you still have to file your taxes during a shutdown — the IRS doesn’t take a vacation.

  
But here’s the catch: refunds and customer service can be delayed if staff are furloughed. That means if you’re expecting money back, it might take longer to arrive.



If possible, file electronically — that usually helps speed things up a bit — and make sure all your documents are in order to avoid extra delays once things reopen.



Travel plans? Brace for bureaucracy.

If you’re planning a trip abroad, get ready for some potential headaches.

Passport and visa processing often slow to a crawl during a shutdown because the offices that handle them operate with reduced staff. Some locations might even close temporarily.



If your passport is about to expire or you need a new one, handle it early — don’t wait until the last minute. And if you’re already traveling soon, check the State Department’s website regularly for updates.



TSA and air traffic controllers are considered essential, so airports stay open, but long lines and low morale can be part of the deal since many of those workers aren’t being paid during the shutdown.



Small business owners and researchers, take note



If you depend on federal grants, SBA loans, or research funding, those programs typically freeze until the government reopens. Applications stop moving, approvals stall, and funding can’t be released.



If that’s you, now’s the time to pause big spending decisions and keep communication open with your contacts or program officers. Once funding resumes, there’s usually a big backlog — so be prepared for a slow restart.



The good news: some things keep running

Not everything grinds to a halt. Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid payments keep going out — those programs are funded separately.

  
Same with the U.S. Postal Service — your mail will still show up, even if it’s a few minutes late.



Bottom line



During a shutdown, patience becomes a survival skill. The best move is to get ahead of anything that involves the federal government — whether that’s renewing a passport, filing taxes, or applying for benefits.



Think of it as weathering a storm: you can’t control when it passes, but you *can* make sure your house (and paperwork) are in order when the clouds clear.



5. Use Community Support



When the government shuts down, it’s easy to feel like you’re on your own — but you’re really not. Across the country, communities step up in big and small ways to help people get through the uncertainty. Whether it’s your local credit union offering payment relief or a neighbor dropping off groceries, there’s a surprising amount of support out there once you know where to look.



Let’s talk about where to start.



Lean on local resources



If your paycheck’s on pause, don’t wait until things get desperate to ask for help. Many local organizations are ready for situations exactly like this.



* Food banks, churches, and community centers often set up special distributions for federal workers and contractors.



* Some local businesses and restaurants even offer free meals or discounts during shutdowns.



* And credit unions (especially ones serving government employees) frequently offer short-term, low- or no-interest loans to help bridge the gap until back pay arrives.



It’s not charity — it’s community. You’ve spent years contributing taxes and public service; now it’s okay to let others lend a hand while things get sorted out.



Check for special programs



During longer shutdowns, many big organizations — from utility companies to mortgage lenders — roll out temporary assistance programs. These can include deferred payments, no late fees, or flexible payment plans.

  
It’s worth a few phone calls or website visits to see what’s available. Often, they don’t advertise these programs loudly; you just have to ask.



Unions and employee associations can be lifesavers

If you’re a member of a union or professional association, reach out to them early. They’re usually on top of the latest updates about relief funds, legal rights, and benefit options. Some even organize food drives or emergency grants specifically for members affected by shutdowns.



Even if you’re not currently active in your union, now’s a great time to connect. They’ve helped people through this before — they’ll know what to do.



Neighbors helping neighbors

Sometimes the most meaningful help doesn’t come from an organization at all. It’s a friend offering to watch your kids for a few hours. It’s a neighbor sharing extra groceries. It’s coworkers trading tips on which credit unions are being the most flexible.



Shutdowns are tough, but they also remind us that community still matters — that people look out for each other when things get hard.



The takeaway



You don’t have to tough it out alone. Between local charities, financial institutions, unions, and the kindness of neighbors, there are plenty of safety nets to catch you while Washington sorts itself out.



Asking for help isn’t weakness — it’s wisdom. The people around you *want* to help; sometimes they’re just waiting for you to reach out.



6. Take Care of Your Mental Health



Let’s be real — a government shutdown doesn’t just mess with your paycheck. It messes with your peace of mind. The uncertainty, the waiting, the constant news updates — it all takes a toll. You might feel frustrated, anxious, or even angry, and that’s completely normal.



When your routine gets thrown off and money feels tight, stress can sneak up fast. So, just as you’re taking care of your finances and daily needs, it’s just as important to take care of *you.*



Acknowledge what you’re feeling



First things first: don’t beat yourself up for feeling stressed or upset. This situation is hard. Even people who seem calm on the outside are probably feeling it, too.

  
Sometimes, just saying out loud, *“Yeah, this is really stressful,”* can be grounding. It gives you permission to deal with the emotions instead of pretending they’re not there.



Stick to a routine

Shutdowns can make your schedule feel out of control — especially if you’re furloughed and not working. Creating a daily routine helps bring back a sense of structure and normalcy.



* Wake up and go to bed at consistent times.



* Eat real meals (not just snacks and coffee).



* Get outside or move your body every day, even if it’s just a walk around the block.



It sounds simple, but routine helps keep your brain from slipping into that “everything is chaos” mindset.



Stay connected

It’s tempting to isolate yourself when you’re stressed or embarrassed about money — but that only makes things harder.

  
Reach out to coworkers, friends, or family members who get it. Many federal employees and contractors have been through shutdowns before, and they’ll understand exactly what you’re dealing with.



Sometimes just venting over coffee or swapping tips on how to stretch your budget can make you feel less alone.



Use available support programs

Most federal agencies have Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that offer free, confidential counseling. Even if you’re furloughed, you often still have access. If you’re not a federal worker, look for community counseling centers telehealth services that charge on a sliding scale.

Don’t wait until you’re at a breaking point — talking to someone early can make a huge difference.



Limit the doom-scrolling

It’s easy to get stuck refreshing news feeds, hoping for updates from Congress — but that constant drip of uncertainty only makes the anxiety worse.

  
Try setting boundaries: check the news once or twice a day, then step away. Replace that screen time with something that recharges you — a hobby, a workout, a good book, or just some quiet time.



Remember, this will end



Every shutdown *does* end. It might not feel like it when you’re in the middle of it, but it always does. The paychecks return, the offices reopen, and life starts to feel normal again.



Until then, give yourself permission to slow down, ask for help, and take care of your mental well-being. You can’t control the politics — but you can protect your peace.

I didn’t convey my sentiment very well. So here’s the same idea, (hopefully) not as messy and without the unintentional emotional chaos. 

Located in the US (ugh), but happy to exchange internationally. I’m open to writing and connecting with all sorts of folks - friendship is its own kind of tenderness, and vulnerability in any form is still vulnerability. 

I miss the intimacy of slowly getting to know someone - idealizing each other through letters, thoughts, and stories, the tiny details, the mutual overthinking. Doesn’t it feel like everyone’s forgotten how to linger in conversation? 

Some things about me: apparently I’ve reached the age where bird watching is genuinely thrilling. It happened overnight. I even bought a pair of halfway decent binoculars (holy shit, good binoculars get weirdly expensive). Yesterday evening I listened to the blue jays absolutely losing their minds over a kestrel. I have a pollinator garden in the front yard that’s gone completely feral. It’s chaos, but some mornings I drink my coffee at the window and watch all the little critters that visit. I knit, though last week my dogs (I used to have a habit of taking in strays but now consider myself in recovery) spilled a Starbucks iced oat chai over most of my in-progress projects, and I haven’t yet had the emotional bandwidth to unfuck them. 

So if you want to trade thoughts and feelings, your favorite poetry, interesting (to you) little slivers of your life, I want to do all of that with you too. I hope you gather the courage to reach out if you think we’d be a good fit. ",3,1760643424.0,penpals,2,1.0,False

And now new LPR symptoms after 1.5 weeks on PPIs 😐,"Back in 2021, I developed a bunch of GERD-like symptoms randomly one day pretty much out of nowhere. It was mostly dyspepsia/indigestion and bloating that was extremely unpleasant and seemingly not tied to any particular trigger. I got on a bunch of various PPIs, heavily restricted my diet, did a month without coffee, a month without alcohol, avoided anything acidic, and basically nothing helped. Took a million tests that found everything normal. Motility, two endoscopies (first one found very slight irritation around gastric antrum, the other found a very small and “standard” hiatal hernia). Allergy test found nothing. Bravo pH test found normal acid levels. H pylori was negative. The last intervention I remember was amitryptaline, and I’m not sure if it did anything or not, but at that point I basically gave up. I had lost 50lb because of food restrictions, was constantly stressed out, and decided I was just going to stop caring about whatever this was and live my life. A few months on, I realized my symptoms had mostly gone away, although I’ve always been a bit more prone to bloating since then. The whole ordeal was about a year.

Then, I had a solid three years of eating whatever and not really thinking about it. And my diet is generally healthy too! So it’s not like I was eating a bunch of junk food and drinking monster. 

Two weeks ago, I was in the middle of some sort of respiratory illness. Whether it was a cold or Covid, I do not know. But one day while I was on the upswing from being sick, I randomly hit my vape and immediately got the familiar sensation of needing to burp excessively. Ever since then, I’ve been back in the GERD zone. At first, it was just some minor bloating and belching, which was stressful but not really that bad, and not comparable to the fist in the chest feeling of 2021’s bout. No particular food seemed like a trigger, it would happen when I drank water etc etc. I got on omeprazole, and continued living my life normally but avoiding hyper-processed fatty foods and big meals, and cut out drinking on weekdays. 

I wasn’t sure if omeprazole was helping much, but it sort of seemed to be reducing burpiness? And when I missed a day, it got worse the next, followed by a better day when I got back on omeprazole, so i figured it was doing something for me. 

Then, this Monday, I ate a little piece of chocolate croissant and got a horrribllle attack. It was like the indigestion from 2021. I felt a little bile come up with one of the burps and I figure that’s when things got really thrown off. 

Ever since then, the bloating and belching is noticeably reduced, but now I have LPR symptoms! I didn’t have those last time! It’s been unpredictable to figure out which if any particular food is causing it, and now basically anything I put in my body is resulting in a low to moderate burn in my throat.

My only cope here is that the two past days the burning started coincided with a switch to pantoprazole? I switched back to omeprazole today, hoping that this could be the reason for the LPR (maybe I was just not responding to panto and getting rebound?) but no such luck yet :( 

It just sucks because I don’t know what to do. I could try restricting foods but that led to EXTREME weight loss last time and a ton of stress that certainly prolonged everything and made it worse. I guess it could have conceivably helped, but given the lack of acid detection on the bravo, the entire year with minimal progress, and the gradual healing once I allowed myself a normal diet, I’m reticent to really start restricting again.

I’ve asked for a referral to a GI, and I’m hoping that there’s a better solution this time around. If anyone has any insights or words of encouragement that this will pass (I know this intellectually but the anxiety is killing me rn) I’ll gladly accept them atp.",1,1760643127.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

Yeah, I simply and truthfully should go out with a bang with awesome/cool introverted friends I've chatted with on this subreddit and I wanted to say I'd hope that keeps on going and you can stick to me like caramel. 

I will close this for the introverts here reading this post as this post is coming to an end, do I really enjoy being an introvert? Would I get out of the gardens of gardens that aren't dripping with caramel because of anxiety being stuck with me? Would I change who I'm as a person?

Well no I simply and truthfully wouldn't, there is one thing nobody has ever gotten from me from Reddit even though people from Reddit think I'm a bot because my lifestyle activities are basically a bot and that's all I'd do is bot my activities daily. However, did you know once I decided to never think that this stage is a prison? 
I once in my 33 years of life wanted to become someone with a social life, go to daily events in my town, try out a job and try to be social. Which yeah, for me ended up being  a terrifying experience, I didn't enjoy myself, I wasn't happy, I didn't feel safe with myself and I would rather be in my complex only coming out only once or twice a week then going back into hiding for a few days and sometimes if the social anxiety is bad I don't go out but once a week.

Wouldn't you want me to feel safe, happy and even if that meant that I had to bot my life every single day with my activities? Cats, naps, Sleep Token lore, music, Skyrim PS4, playing Nintendo Switch games with online friends Co-Op mode tea, sometimes energy drinks, sometimes coffee, YT, watching Sleep Token reels from  a YT content creator that post new Sleep Token reels and what if I told you this made me happy botting my life every single day? Wouldn't you want me happy?
 
I'm also not embarrassed to tell my online introverted friend that I plan on living on SSI and EBT for a very long time, because I don't have the luxury life of my family has gifted me a luxurious garden when they all pass away.

I would rather you send me a medium or long winded chat request to keep me engaged and interested in you. How about, you can hit me with your Sleep Token one liners? 

Yeah, I want to online date only.

Time to turnover, 1 day, 3 hours, 46 minutes.

My attending and I spent the morning gaining valuable experience.  I placed 10 IVs and a couple of arterial lines, but I was still dogshit with the ultrasound.   He was doing simultaneous central lines on both sides of the neck and was already 3 levels higher than me. 

“You know if you don’t get better at that skill,  your only available class when you reach an ICU is going to be nurse practitioner, and let me tell you something, that’s about as bad as it gets. You won’t get any coffee upgrades either.

“When we get to the breakroom, I’ll make sure to spend a few hours on the ultrasound. “

We turned a corner, and there was an automatic door opening and closing only halfway.  One thing was certain, even after the Turning, the hospital doors still didn’t work worth a damn.  Bile and blood dotted the floors and walls.  The smell of a fresh code brown was heavy on the air.  Even with no visible fire, the fire alarms blared loudly, which meant one thing; we had found a neighborhood PACU.

After squeezing in through the door, we stumbled upon 20 pacu nurses walking around and doing absolutely nothing.  A description of the monsters displayed on our interface:
_____________________________
“PACU NURSE level 1:  These bitches claim to have done it all in nursing, but what they really want is a patient dead on the stretcher so they don’t have to do a damn thing. Their one goal in life, is to write your little punk ass up.  Pacu nurses can be calmed with the following phrases “those figs look good on you, and sure, you can have my pen.”

Warning if you do not have dilaudid in your pocket, Pacu nurse attacks are increased by 10% and their attitude is worsened by 20%

Oh and one last thing, if you don’t have orders in, you are already dead.”

1o8fs17,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broomfield/comments/1o8fs17/broomfield_elections_as_seen_by_ai_with_sources/,Broomfield Elections as seen by AI with sources - City Council Races Ward 4,"# Ward 4: Larry Hardouin (Republican-endorsed) vs. Sean McKenzie (Democrat-endorsed)

**Incumbent:** Bruce H. Leslie's term is ending.\[8\]\[6\]

# Larry Hardouin (Republican-endorsed)

**Background:** Engineering background with strong analytical skills. Extensive volunteer experience in Broomfield including HOA board service, election judge, and community organizing. Long-term Broomfield resident with deep community ties.\[57\]\[58\]

**Platform and Priorities:**

**Local Focus:** ""Focus will be local and what is best for Broomfield."" Emphasizes Ward 4 representation, having conversations with residents, actively assisting with issues requiring city help.\[58\]

**Fiscal Responsibility:** Detailed fiscal approach including:

* Top-down budget review starting with big picture revenue and expenses
* Multi-year projections to plan for major costs and avoid surprises
* Annual ""keep the lights on"" baseline budget for maintaining current services
* Discretionary budget for new initiatives only after baseline is covered
* Prioritizing financial sustainability without jeopardizing future generations\[58\]

**Business Environment:** Supports local restaurants, coffee shops, entertainment, and businesses that improve employment options and enable spending locally. Focuses on attracting businesses for new development/redevelopment.\[58\]

**Pragmatic Sustainability:** Three-pillar approach (environmental, social, economic) emphasizing ""practical, adaptable, and context-specific solutions"" that account for ""unique circumstances, environments, and stakeholders involved"".\[58\]

**Housing:** Working with Broomfield Housing Alliance Director to understand processes and create communication plan helping residents understand goals and methods for improving Broomfield's housing.\[58\]

**Water Planning:** As population grows, emphasizes planning for adequate water supply while ensuring efficient infrastructure.\[58\]

**Community Leadership:** Endorsers describe him as ""considerate, intelligent, and wise"" with ability to ""approach challenges pragmatically after debating alternative strategies."" Noted for fairness, good listening, fiscal wisdom, sound judgment, and significant time devotion to neighborhood service.\[57\]

**Endorsements:** Endorsed by Broomfield County Republicans and multiple Ward 4 residents who have worked with him on HOA boards and community projects.\[32\]\[57\]\[5\]

**Analysis:** Hardouin brings substantial volunteer governance experience (HOA boards, election judge) providing relevant background without Council baggage. His engineering background suggests analytical, data-driven approach to problem-solving. The detailed fiscal framework demonstrates serious thought about budget processes beyond general ""fiscal responsibility"" rhetoric. His pragmatic sustainability approach attempts to balance environmental concerns with economic and social factors, potentially appealing to voters wanting environmental progress without economic sacrifice. Strong community relationships and endorsements from neighbors suggest trusted, engaged leader. However, his Republican endorsement places him at odds with current Council majority's direction.

# Sean McKenzie (Democrat-endorsed)

**Background:** Sustainability professional with nearly a decade of consulting experience working with Fortune 500 companies, cities, and nonprofits on sustainability strategy implementation. Pursuing Master's in Sustainability Leadership from University of Cambridge. Recently married, choosing Broomfield to build future and eventually raise family.\[59\]\[60\]

**Platform and Priorities:**

**Sustainability Leadership:** Professional background in advising C-suite executives on Net-Zero goals and designing sustainability strategies. Believes ""most meaningful change happens at the local level"".\[60\]\[59\]

**Servant Leadership:** Emphasizes ""servant leader"" approach including facilitating environmental strategy conversations and mentoring youth leaders.\[59\]\[60\]

**Listening Before Leading:** Campaign focuses on ""listening before leading,"" protecting what makes Broomfield home while welcoming change that works for everyone.\[60\]

**Preserving Community Character:** Campaign slogan: ""Preserving What We Love, Progressing With Purpose."" Balances protecting existing community qualities with thoughtful, intentional change.\[60\]

**Values Alignment:** Chose Broomfield as home reflecting values of ""sustainability, inclusivity, and community."" Wants to ensure it ""remains a place where future generations can thrive, afford to live, and feel a true sense of belonging"".\[59\]

**Collaborative Approach:** Describes himself as ""collaborator, a doer, and someone who listens deeply"" before acting.\[59\]\[60\]

**Personal Investment:** Recently married, living in Ward 4, and planning to raise family in Broomfield, giving him personal stake in long-term community health.\[60\]\[59\]

**Endorsements:** Endorsed by Broomfield Democrats.\[4\]

**Analysis:** McKenzie brings impressive professional credentials in sustainability—one of the most specific, relevant professional backgrounds of any candidate. Cambridge master's program and Fortune 500 consulting experience demonstrate serious expertise. However, he's new to Broomfield (recently married and moved to area), which could raise questions about community ties and understanding of local issues. His emphasis on listening suggests awareness that newcomer status requires earning trust. The sustainability focus aligns with current Council priorities but may concern voters worried about implementation costs. His personal investment (choosing Broomfield for future family) provides authentic motivation beyond political ambition.

**Ward 4 Race Analysis:**

This race contrasts experienced community volunteer with fiscal/analytical focus (Hardouin's engineering background, HOA service, detailed budget framework) against sustainability professional with global experience applied locally (McKenzie's consulting background, Cambridge education, environmental expertise). Hardouin offers deep community roots, proven local leadership, and detailed fiscal philosophy emphasizing efficiency and pragmatic decision-making. McKenzie provides specialized sustainability expertise, fresh perspective, and commitment to balancing preservation with progress. The race reflects fundamental questions about local governance: should Council members be longtime community members with deep institutional knowledge and networks, or can newcomers with specialized expertise and fresh perspectives serve effectively? Should fiscal efficiency be the primary lens (Hardouin's approach), or should sustainability be the organizing principle (McKenzie's focus)? Both emphasize listening and collaboration, suggesting less ideological rigidity than some other races. Ward 4 voters should consider whether they value established community ties and analytical fiscal approach (Hardouin) or specialized environmental expertise and progressive vision (McKenzie).

1o8frmb,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_hotflashtracker/comments/1o8frmb/hot_flashes_made_me_track_my_entire_life_for_30/,Hot flashes made me track my entire life for 30 days — here’s what I actually found,"I didn’t start out trying to build anything. I just wanted to sleep through the night again.

The hot flashes came out of nowhere — 3 a.m., then noon, then after lunch, then in the grocery store. My doctor said, *“It’s normal, everyone’s different.”* That answer felt useless. So I decided to find out for myself what was really happening.

For 30 days, I tracked everything: what I ate, when I slept, stress levels, caffeine, even the weather. I wrote it all down — coffee at 8 a.m., wine at 7 p.m., two hot flashes by 10. By week 2, patterns started to show up. Stress and lack of sleep were bigger culprits than I expected. Caffeine didn’t help either, but humidity? That one surprised me the most.

At the end of the month, I had pages of notes and a few “aha” moments. My symptoms weren’t random at all — they were data points. Once I saw the trends, I could predict bad days before they happened.

That experiment eventually turned into a small web app I built for myself, then shared with a few friends. I called it **HotFlashTracker.app**. But this post isn’t to promote it — I’m just curious:

Has anyone else tried tracking their symptoms like this?

1o8frdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/cosleeping/comments/1o8frdq/im_in_desperate_need_of_help_with_sleep/,I’m in desperate need of help with sleep 😭,"Hi everyone - I need some advice and I guess reassurance? I just spoke to my sons pediatrician and asked if she has any recommendations on how to help my son sleep longer stretches and she straight up said I’m late in the game to sleep train him 🫠🫠 he’s 2 years old (as of September) we have always coslept and he’s always been a breastfed baby. I don’t want to “sleep train” him and never have. I’m a firm believer in babies needing us all throughout the night and responding to his cues. About 2 weeks before he turned 2 I started introducing to him the reduction in breastfeeding at night especially to fall asleep. He did very well and adjusted within 3-4 days. I bought a book to help with this and it was amazing, the images helped him understand so much more. I was really hoping this would help him sleep longer stretches but he still wakes every 2-3 hours and I’m so exhausted 😔 I feel like I’m withering away and I’m so proud of myself for lasting this long but I’m really really struggling mentally and physically already with no sleep for such a long time. Note to add - I’m a single mom and we live with my parents. 
Do you have any tips on how I can help him sleep longer stretches? I was searching essential oils to put in my diffuser that help to calm and relax and promote sleep and was going to try that? He’s a super super hyper kid during the day and he’s been so tired this past week that he’s taking earlier naps. He needs to get more sleep as well so I want to help the both of us. Mom needs more energy to play with him all day and not live off of coffee 🥲🥲 thank you all for listening 🩵

Edit to add: I’ve been trying magnesium lotion for almost a year now. I’ve used it on myself and it def helps sleep well except him 🥲

Also, He naps once anywhere between 1.5-3 hours. He has taken just a 30 min nap though and run around outside all day, riding bike, playing etc and is exhausted by bed time and that still doesn’t work 😭 I’ve tried a later bedtime as well and nothing. He’s usually in bed between 8-9pm depending on when he woke from his nap. He usually naps around 12/12:30pm ",2,1760642946.0,cosleeping,9,1.0,False

Okay… I’m not even sure how this is *real,* but apparently, this year’s **🎉 Holiday Giveaway Extravaganza** is going beyond anything we’ve seen before. Free ebooks, discount coupons, AND random bonus gifts — all bundled together like some kind of festive internet mystery box.  

I mean, what’s the catch? Honestly, it seems like there *isn’t* one. 😅  

I jumped in thinking it was another too-good-to-be-true offer, but then got hit with *actual* downloads and gift codes. So yes, friends — this one’s *legit.*  

---

**Here’s what’s inside this virtual sleigh of surprises:**  

- 📚 **Free Ebooks:** From self-growth to tech guides — instant downloads, no payment wall.  
- 💳 **Coupons & Discounts:** Real, scannable deals on digital tools, streaming, and even a coffee subscription.

**Why people are buzzing about it:**  
- Everything is **free** — no shady “7-day trials.”  
- They refresh new ebooks daily, which feels like opening advent calendar doors online.  
- Some users are claiming they snagged tools worth $200+ just by checking early.

💬 *But also...* am I the only one slightly confused how such giveaways even exist?  
Like, *who* funds thousands of downloads during the holidays?  
Maybe it’s a marketing thing? Maybe some kind of goodwill experiment?  
Either way — I’m not questioning it too hard while I’m busy unpacking bonus content. 😆

What are my options.  I was thinking maybe creating Synology albums which mimic the directory structure.  But frankly I don't know. Also see there is some sort of import in immich, don't know how that is different than one-way sync from my old folder structure.

You ever notice how sitting on the couch binge-watching a new show can sometimes leave you feeling like a human pretzel? 🙃 Trust me, you're not alone! After 50, our bodies can feel a bit like rusty old machines. But here's the kicker: flexibility isn't just for gymnasts and yoga instructors. It’s about feeling better, moving freely, and living life to the fullest! 

So, how do we tackle this stiff situation? Let's break it down:

**1. Embrace the Good Stuff**  
First off, it's not about contorting yourself into a ball or pulling off a perfect forward fold. Instead, think about these gentle practices:
- **Stretch it out daily**: A few stretches while you sip your morning coffee can work wonders.
- **Go for a walk**: Simple but effective! Walking stretches your legs and keeps the body in motion.
- **Fun classes**: Give dance, Zumba, or gentle yoga a shot. You might discover a hidden passion!

**2. Get to Know Your Body**  
This is such a key point! We’re talking self-discovery here. How does your body feel today? 
- **Listen to what it’s telling you**: Some days, a deep stretch is just what you need; other days, sticking to light movement might be best.
- **Respect your limits**: Don’t push it too hard—remember, it’s about finding joy in movement, not agony!

**3. Stay Hydrated, Stay Happy**  
Seriously, drinking enough water is like giving your muscles a hug. It helps keep everything loose and limber!
- **Snack smart**: Foods rich in antioxidants (hello, berries!) can also support muscle recovery and overall flexibility.

You might be thinking, “But I’ve never been great at this fitness stuff!” Here’s the truth: it’s not about being great. It's about *showing up* for yourself. And who’s to say you can’t start now? 🌈 

Plus, I stumbled upon this amazing resource that really aligns with our belief that we are the strongest people. They’ve got a fantastic freebie guide that might help kickstart your journey to feeling fit and flexible after 50! Check it out here: [Online Yoga and At-Home Workouts](https://liveitupdeals-hub.github.io/online-yoga-and-at-home-workouts). Seriously, it could make a big difference!

At the end of the day, it’s all about taking small steps toward feeling better. Remember, flexibility is less about bending like a pretzel and more about bending into a happier, healthier you!

So, what’s your favorite way to keep yourself moving? Any fun routines or stretches you love? Let’s share some ideas and inspire each other! ✨",1,1760642537.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

I wanted to take a moment to share my thoughts and experience with three espresso machines I’ve had the chance to use: the Gaggia Classic Pro, which is my personal machine in Chile with a Eureka Mignon Silenzio Grinder, then in Canada, I have the Breville Barista Pro (grinder included), and the ECM Mechanika Max with a Baratza Encore ESP grinder. As a coffee lover living in Chile and Canada, I've enjoyed experimenting with different setups. 

Now, let me start with the Gaggia Classic Pro. This machine has been my go-to, and I have to say, even with no modifications, it consistently delivers a beautiful, bright, and flavorful espresso. I’ve tried various high-quality beans, and the results have been impressive every time. There’s something magical about the shots I pull from the GCP that just hits the spot! 

On the other hand, I’ve had the chance to use the Breville Barista Pro and the ECM Mechanika Max in Canada. While both machines are beautiful and well-built, I have to admit that I’ve found the output from my Gaggia to be superior. The flavor profile and overall quality of the espresso just seems to shine more with the GCP. 

I know that both the Breville and the ECM are designed to be user-friendly and offer great features (PID in the ECM case), but for me, the taste experience remains the ultimate measure. It’s pretty interesting how a machine that’s more modest in price and features can sometimes outshine the higher-end models in terms of espresso quality. 

Just wanted to share my experience with you all! If you’re considering options, I highly recommend giving the Gaggia Classic Pro a shot, you might be pleasantly surprised by the results!

But of course he’s here just ahead of me at the cafeteria line. And he has company, because of course he does. Shit, I know it’s a public space and that he probably doesn’t even factor the fact that I’m here, but he’s everywhere. He’s in the canteen when I get hungry during second period, and on his bike before 7AM as we are headed to school from the three pathways he could take and the different times he could leave his house. He’s at the bakery’s line, and my research counselor mentions his name when we are scheduling our lab hours to coordinate with HIS research advisor. He’s a few lines ahead at our mandatory afternoon seminar, sat at an angle in which I can’t not see him as I lift my head up. He’s walking through the hallways when I’m going to a meeting, he’s coincidentally at the study room I pick in the library and it would be too weird to close the door immediately after seeing him. I know it’s not a big town or a very populated school, and I know we left ours together so this is quite inevitable. And now he might actually want to go to the same university as me, at the same school, at the same campus bc of course he would since that place is a fucking dream for literally any aspiring STEM student in the country or whatever.
And now I just have to try not to look at him from my table in the cafeteria, because I know he won’t be looking at me (and when he does it’s just so disconcerting). I can’t leave the place; I mean I could, but it would be odd since I can’t drink coffee inside the library and I’d have to stand in front of the entry like a psycho while drinking it.

Sorry in advance as some of the lingo I use is specific to Charlotte's channel so some of you might find it really weird, but the Potatoes will get it 😂 

I wanted to share with y'all my most satisfying petty revenge story from back when I was a hairdresser. It's petty because I enjoyed it so much, really, but the actual revenge was served by Karma itself...hence the title. 

Now I am gonna have to give a lot of context so this one *will* be long.

I (23 at the time) was working at a salon in a big city.
It was the very first salon I ever worked at and I was freshly out of hairdressing school. The salon in question had been open for nearly two decades and the owner - let's call her Dracula, shall we? - was a *Piece. Of. Work* 
Always talking about herself, thinks she's the best hairdresser around, pretended to be the ""chill"" boss but was actually Cruella de Vil, saunters in to the salon at noon when it's been open since 8:30am, tells the *ExAcT* same drama laden stories to Every. Single. One of her clients in the Exact. Same. Way. All. Day. Long. While the rest of us try to do our jobs without gagging ourselves with the bristle end of a round brush. 
And the stories she would tell *the staff* - GURL! Those were *next level messy.*

This humanoid ebola virus once told me she was having s** with her DAUGHTER'S FRIEND'S DAD in an RV while the two girls were SLEEPING BENEATH THEM ON THE BOTTOM BUNK!!!

But Wait!! There's more...

Her daughter's friend's dad was...MAaRRiiiEDD!!!!!

I swear on my marriage I am not making this shit up.

Hopefully this gives you all a little bit of insight into this lady's mushy lizard brain. 
Now...onto the main course:

I had graduated two weeks before starting my first day at Dracula's salon. I was hired as an assistant in order to practice more before moving on to be a junior stylist and so on and so forth...
I had practiced cuts, colour and styling on mannequins throughout all of school and my last semester was actually spent entirely in the school's discount salon practicing with real clients. Dracula's salon *did* allow for assistants to come in *outside* of our work hours with clients we would find ourselves but otherwise our actual work days consisted of doing every client's shampoo, applying toners, treatments and all the cleaning and maintenance of the salon, while simultaneously serving guests drinks, cleaning up the hairdresser's workstations in between clients, sweeping the floor and washing all the towels, aprons, smocks, colour bowls and brushes. 

After working there for a little over 2.5 years and getting a whole lot more in depth training, I finally decided to bring in one of my friends who wanted a haircut. I got permission from management and asked that my supervisor be my favourite senior stylist - let's call him Marcus - since we needed to be supervised during our appointments until we qualified to become junior stylists. 
My friend wanted to do a big chop.
She went from having  hair halfway down her back to a *bob*.
It. Was. Fire. 
I was super proud of myself, Markus did give me super helpful tips, but mostly just watched and didn't actually hover over me, he would go back and forth from his clients and would come watch/guide me every so often. When I was done, everyone around us said it looked awesome on her, and my friend was in love with it and felt like a million bucks. 
After lots of admiring in the mirror and some selfies we get up from the chair and go take a few ""after"" photos for my Instagram page. When we're done with those I go downstairs to the staff room to grab my things so we can leave.

Enter...Dracula.
As I'm packing my things with a giant smile on my face I hear her take a sharp inhale and say:
(For this part let's pretend my name is Victoria)

""Victoria...do you know what the procedure is when assistants want to bring in their own clients for practice?""

""Um..yeah of course"" I answered kind of confused.

""Well *CLEARLY* you don't""

I'm just silent at this point.

""You know, I can't have you coming in here to *play hairdresser* whenever you want. I have a reputation to uphold. My salon is honestly the best in the city, and I might dare say the whole country...so you can't just come in and do as you please with zero training. It's important for you to understand that basically *everything* you did during that haircut was wrong. You should have been supervised the *entire* time and you're also suppose to *ask* if you can come in with your client""

""But...Dracula... that's exactly what I did; I asked Gemma (the manager) and I was being supervised by Markus, with his permission. Gemma set the whole thing up in the schedule"" 

""Yeah, well you never asked *me*, so next time you want to bring in a client, make sure to follow the proper procedure and also *ask* when you don't know what you're doing and need help""

I. Was. Mortified. 

She had completely broken my spirit. I went upstairs, grabbed my friend and we left the salon quickly, but without a peep. 
After I left I got a text from the assistant manager - let's call her Courtney - who was really nice and always had the backs of the assistants. She asked me if I was okay because I looked a little sad when I left. I told her what happened and she said that was really not okay and she thinks I should try talking to Dracula and letting her know I didn't appreciate how she spoke to me.  She said she was certain that Dracula would totally see how she was over the line and apologize and then I wouldn't be left feeling so crappy. 
For a little more context, most of the staff had been there since day 1 when the salon opened, and they were all very close. They were also a little blind to Dracula's problematic side and constantly made excuses for her. ""You just don't know her very well yet. She's actually really cool and down to earth, you just need to get to know her better"" bla bla bla.

To be fair though, they had a good reason to be a little blind, because the salon was run *very* well and their set up was basically a hairdresser's dream. They had full control over their schedules and prices, they made 50% commission on every service, everything was done by the book and they were declared as actual employees for tax purposes. So they would get paid vacation weeks, they had the right to ei if ever they got injured or sick and needed to stop working, paid maternity or paternity leave and they could even stock pile their vacation days if they wanted. Meaning they could choose to not go on vacation for let's say two whole years and on the third they would take a month and a half off. So I didn't necessarily blame them for not wanting to see the owner's less than ideal side. 

After the text from the assistant manager Courtney I decided to take her advice and I set up a meeting with Dracula. In order to do that, I had to message Gemma because she handled Dracula's schedule. So I did, and Gemma set the whole thing up. 
Cut to the day of the meeting.
I'm downstairs in the staff room waiting for her to show up. I waited for *10 minutes*...
Finally, she shows up and sits down in front of me, visibly irritated and abruptly starts the whole thing by saying:

""Okay Victoria, so what the fuck is all this drama?"" 

""Ummm...Pardon me?"" I said, super taken aback by her snappy attitude and tone of voice.

""Well I get a text message from Gemma, who had her weekend *ruined* because you decided you're ""insulted"" by what I said to you the other day?"" 

""I'm sorry, what? How did I ruin her weekend? All I did was ask for a meeting with you like we're all supposed to do when we want to set one up"" 

""Yeah, but you're not supposed to text her *on her day off* with all your drama"" 

""I really didn't cause any drama, I just asked for a meeting, and Gemma has told me and the other assistants about 100 times that no matter the day, if we need anything or have any questions that we should just text her, because she keeps her phone on vibrate and it's never a bother to her, because she'll just see it the next time she checks her pho -"" 

""Let's just get down to this ""issue"" you're having"" she cuts me off before I can finish.

So I nervously explained to her how I felt and told her I didn't appreciate her tone, and some of her words too, like saying I was ""playing"" hairdresser and so on...

""I'm sorry you feel like I disrespected you, but you should really know me better than that by now, when I said you were ""playing hairdresser"" I just meant that as like an expression, sometimes I just say banal things and they aren't meant to be taken to heart. So I'm sorry you took it badly, but you really should know me better than that. I'm not a rude person, I'm not mean, I'm not a bully. And you *should*  understand that I have a reputation to uphold. So making this into a big drama about your feelings being hurt because I was doing my job as the owner of the best salon in the city is just immature and a waste of everyone's time. Next time you can just ask me to teach you how to properly cut hair, I'm an excellent mentor and I've told you time and time again that I'll take time out of *my very busy schedule* and take you under my wing. Maybe let's focus on growing instead of causing drama and bothering people on their weekend, hm?"" She said to me, with the squintiest little bitch face I ever saw. 

I couldn't say anything at that point honestly. I just gave a half baked smile and nodded my head. 

After that I went home and cried of anger and confusion. I knew she had basically gaslit me and deflected everything, but I was so taken aback by everything she was saying that I froze completely in the moment. I was *so mad* at myself for not standing up to her and letting her walk all over me. 
After a few hours though, my anger shifted from being mad at myself to being livid at her. That's when I decided I was done, I was going to look for a different salon and quit. So I moved in the shadows  and 4-ish months later I found myself a new salon where I would get to work side by side with senior stylists and actually help them with their colour applications and blow-dries daily and also practice my cuts, by myself, on any client I brought in, and I'd get to do this whenever I wanted during my work week, and actually get paid for it! Unlike at Dracula's salon. 

Now I found this new salon right before Christmas time, which is a hairdresser's busiest time of the year, so I had told the new salon owners that I wanted to be able to finish the entire Christmas season with my current salon, so that I didn't leave my coworkers to train a new assistant during the busiest time of year. They genuinely loved that and said they would absolutely be okay with me coming on board in the new year. So I signed my contract with them and then even decided I would give Dracula the full month and a half notice of my departure because that would give Gemma enough time to find a replacement while I was still there, and they would be fully trained by the time I left. 

I told my assistant manager first over some coffee and a smoke outside because her and I were actually close, and she was genuinely happy for me. The annoying thing was that the meeting with Dracula also needed to be outside, because there was some necessary maintenance going on in the staff room. It was me, Dracula and Gemma in the meeting. I gather all my courage and I start off by saying how I'm really grateful for the opportunity of working at such a well established salon and I've learned so much and blablabla - *all that nice stuff*. To be able to leave on good terms, because again, hairdressers *talk* and word of feuds and drama spreads like mono at a college party. I told them that I was only leaving because this new salon would allow me the opportunity to learn every day by working side by side with senior stylists, because again, I didn't want to leave on bad terms. So I couldn't just go out there and say ""Dracula - I'm leaving because you're a total c*nt storm""  which would have been the real reason... 

The whole time that I'm talking, Dracula is looking at me with the JUDGIEST face of all time, she almost looked disgusted. When I finished telling her everything and thanking both her and Gemma profusely, all hell breaks loose. Dracula starts *raising her voice at me* - keep in mind we are still *outside* - and saying that I'm being completely played because ""no salon lets assistants work side by side with senior stylists"" - keep in mind this is coming from a woman that outright told me that's how she learned, and got her diploma after just as a formality - she said that I was basically saying a giant F You to her and ""everything she did for me"" she said that I was never going become a hairdresser if I didn't ""get proper mentorship"" and that it didn't matter that I was giving a month and a half notice and that I was, in fact, abandoning my coworkers and scr**ing them all over during the busiest time of the year, because it's still busy after the new year. 

TO BE CLEAR - the minute New Years is over, most hair salons go into the slowest time of their entire year because people need to recover financially from the whole Christmas spending. 

Suffice it to say that I went back inside crying my eyes out. I immediately went downstairs to just throw in a batch of laundry and cry in peace, because, Oh Yeah! I still had an 8 hour shift to finish after that...
At this time the maintenance guy is gone and I'm just crying and doing laundry. Markus comes downstairs and sees the state I'm in and I tell him the jist of what happened. He said that it was outrageous and that I should leave for the rest of the day so she can learn to appreciate me, because I certainly did her a favour by giving her *a month and a half notice* when I had zero legal obligation to do so. He said that the hairstylists would be able to survive me leaving for the day, and that he would help the other stylists himself to help compensate for my absence as much as possible. I thanked him and told him I wouldn't do that because I didn't want to make things worse. 

But then...
In walks Courtney....and she's crying her eyes out.
For context, this is NOT a person that will cry easily, like at all. We both ask her what's wrong and she says that she went to speak to Dracula and see how the talk went, and that Dracula became furious with her for not telling her that I was leaving when she found out - even though she only found out maybe 10 minutes before Dracula did - and she literally *yelled at her* outside, and said horrible things to her. She then went on to say that she honestly didn't want to finish her shift and that she was leaving. That's when I said ""well if you're going, I'm going too"" 

So we packed our shit and left.
We talked the whole way home and when we had to part ways we were still texting back and forth. I got home and went directly to my bestie's house to smoke some 🌿 💨 after that orange-juice-after-toothpaste of a morning. 
That's when I get a text. From Dracula...

I didn't even read the full message and immediately went to tell Courtney that she texted me. When I'm typing I can see that Courtney is *also* typing. We both send our messages and they're identical:
""Dracula just texted me"" 
We send each other screenshots of the texts and MY FLABBERS WERE GASTED! This used Q-tip actually texted us both not even 1 minute apart, two very long texts, which clearly showed she drafted them both before sending them out. 
So the b**** actually put *thought* into these. 
Let's just say, our messages had *very* different energies to them. Mine was just more deflection and berratement, while Courtney's was *so much nicer* 

She went on and on in her text to Courtney apologizing to her and telling her how valued she is. 
After reading each other's texts we were both *livid*. Courtney saw plain as day how manipulative she was and said she was disgusted by how different the messages were. She said that Dracula was only being nice to her because she was afraid of losing a second employee, but likely decided she had nothing to lose in being mean to me some more because I had quit already anyways. That's when I snapped. I agreed with Courtney and said that if Dracula really thinks she has nothing to lose, then allow me to prove her wrong. I sent a text message to Gemma and said that I was quitting effective immediately and that she should have thought twice before *yet again* treating me like crap. 

After I quit, I was still in contact with Courtney and she would give me *allll the tea* about the fallout at the salon with the senior stylists and the other assistants. After just a few weeks, the other assistants started to leave, one by one, they all found better salons, and with the turn over rate for assistants sky rocketing and most of the new ones not lasting longer than 2 months, the hairdressers just got more and more mad at Dracula, because they need the help of the assistants in order to stay on track of their double and sometimes triple booked schedules. Their days were becoming increasingly harder and more stressful and soon enough they were all voicing their anger at Dracula. She became so stressed that she developed shingles... She also got hit in the face super hard by a branch one day because she wasn't watching where she was going. As the weeks went on I just got more and more stories about the bad karma that was following Dracula everywhere. The dad of her daughter's friend that she had slept with went on to cheat on her, with her neighbour - in her RV!! Her daughter moved out to live with her father full time in a different city. Her car got towed 5 different times and more and more wonderful little happenings that were apparently sending her completely over the edge as time went on.
It was HILARIOUS! And then... I got the best message in the world. 
This was just 4 months after I quit. 
Courtney texts me:
""Gemma quit and went back to Egypt"" 

THE FLABBERS!!! ALL OF THEM GASTED! 

Gemma was Dracula's most important employee because she held that salon together and did *literally everything* when it came to running it behind the scenes. All the paperwork, all the hiring, the orders, the schedules, the books. EVERYTHING. 
She said that Dracula had been driving Gemma insane ever since I quit and that Gemma was starting to really crack with how unreasonable and hard to talk to Dracula had become. The straw that broke the camel's back was when Dracula SHOWED UP AT GEMMA'S HOUSE and YELLED at her for wanting to take a vacation. Gemma's husband had to *physically remove* Dracula from their home and Gemma quit right then and there via a two word text to Dracula. It took about a year after that but Dracula did lose literally every single one of her senior stylists and despite having hired new ones, because they simply didn't come with the clientele that her previous stylists did; her salon sank. She had to sell everything at a loss and went on to work in a tiny neighbourhood salon. It's now been nearly a decade (I'm 32 now) Dracula's still working there as far as I'm concerned and all my old coworkers are working in wonderful salons in big cities, making bank and living their best lives. Gemma is still in Egypt and decided she's retired and just spending time with her husband, family and her three dogs. Courtney left to go live her best life in Europe and as for me, I stayed in hairdressing for about 5 years until I moved on to a very high paying corporate job in a different city, working for a company that was voted best company to work for. I get treated like an actual human and work with wonderfully caring people that don't take themselves too seriously. I'm also *very* happily married to my best friend in the whole world, soon to be celebrating our second year of bliss! And we're about to move into our brand new home - the first one we ever got to pick together, since we've been living in an apartment I've had since before meeting him. 

Karma is sweet, and all is well that ends well! 
For all deserving parties of course...

Thanks for reading everyone! 
I hope you all got as much satisfaction as I did from that sweet karmic revenge! ",3,1760641617.0,karma,0,1.0,False

Something missing ? Just a deep emptiness, or sense of loss ? Many nights, you laid next to your sleeping ex and craved an emotional closeness that he could not provide. Even a 'supposed' romantic getaway left you feeling empty and alone. You wanted to be somewhere else...anywhere else.

And then it happened. You met a certain someone who seemed to always brighten your day. A friendly smile, a laugh, a deep attraction of some kind was growing inside that made you feel alive and hopeful. It didn't matter whether you were talking, texting, sharing a coffee. In any case, it was the high point of your day, Every hug felt wonderful. She smelled so nice, her skin so soft, her hair so silky. You wanted to be near her, always. You were falling in love. But wait ! ""She's a woman, and I can't have these feelings. It's just not 'right'. It's not ok"". But you can't help it !!!! When you touch her hand, she doesn't draw it away, so you touch and hold her hand as often as possible. You sit on the sofa to watch a movie. So close your thighs are touching. You're aware of the warmth between your bodies and you're feeling excited and anxious at the same time. After what seems like hours, you gently touch her cheek. And as she turns her head to face you, you look deeply into her eyes and draw close. You kiss her softly, and she kisses you back. You are exploding with joy that she feels the same. This is the most wonderful and scary moment of your entire life.

I'm in a better headspace and my new place is all set up. My friends who I was with that night have not been single in many years. Either married or in long-term relationships. 

Immediately I get them telling me ""oh don't bother with online dating try joing clubs or meeting people in the real life"". I'm 36 and own my business. Which means I work alot and throughout my day to day life I don't meet many single ladies.

It's much easier in your 20's when more people are likely to be single. I workout at a fancy gym but I'm not going to approach ladies at the gym. I'm not going to cold approach ladies at coffee shops or bars. I'm 6'3 and have harder features. Even though I am a giant teddy bear I can come off as intimidating. I am also more introverted. I'm a better listener than talker and do better when we're talking 1 on 1. Which is why online will work better for me because I can meet women that I normally would not meet in my day to day life. I will try speed dating or other singles events but cold approach has never worked well for me as a guy who's more on the introvert side.

Anyways that's my rant. Curious to know what is some bad advice you have gotten post divorce?",7,1760641445.0,Divorce,5,1.0,False

I know I'm stupid and I send it anyway... because he sounded normal when I talked to him.

We are not from the area but live in North NJ, and 95% of our guests were from the south or other parts of the country and had never visited NYC.

We chose Perfect Wedding NYC originally for an elopement style ceremony, but we decided to use their loft space, New York Wedding Loft, which is located near Bryant Park. The package we chose was the Ceremony and Mingle Package at $3500. It is 2 hours of venue space for up to 60 people, BYOB, officiant is provided and they also take care of our license after the ceremony, the entire space is decorated, hour of photography included, use of fridge, coolers, ice buckets, a bridal suite, music using air play, cool lighting if we wanted, the most BEAUTIFUL bouquet of flowers I have ever seen along with a boutonniere for the groom, and a bridal attendant who was beyond helpful the entire time. We chose to add an hour of time so we would not be rushed ($550) then we added an extra 30 minutes of photography ($275). Our couple photos were taken at the NY Public Library as well as Grand Central Station, along with a few street shots. We treated this space/time like a cocktail hour and we encouraged our guests to arrive early and grab a drink or snack before the ceremony. There were (2) 8ft tables provided which I brought my own table cloths for, however we could have rented from the venue for $30 per white cloth- I just wanted to use a certain color. We did have to provide our own ice, which was fine we ended up using our own coolers instead of their nice white long cooler. We brought fun sunglasses and a polaroid camera to keep guests entertained which was a huge hit, and we played a Spotify playlist. This loft was and is gorgeous and perfect for what we needed. Also to note- there were a ton of add-ons available too like a Content Creator, Videographer, Musicians etc.  
For snacks, we made our own cheese and meat tray, veggie tray, babybell cheeses, beef jerky sticks, UNCRUSTABLES (yall do not sleep on these, people loved them) and did cupcakes instead of cake. We also brought an assortment of booze, made a batch of Cosmos and Sweet Tea served in glass bottles, and had mini sodas available. We bought food and beverage items over time, so I cant give an accurate estimate for this part but it was no more than $400 if I had to guess but that is most def girl math.

We then moved to the Arlo Hotel in Midtown to have our reception on their rooftop at ART Midtown. The space was PERFECT for our group size. We hired a DJ that we befriended at a local coffee shop (tycedj) so the vibes were immaculate. He was right under $1k. We had the space privately from 4:30-7:30pm, so being able to see the sunset into nightfall was again, PERFECT and was really enjoyable. Plus, no decorations needed with a view of the city and the Empire State Building! We also had an entire team of servers and bartenders who were truly helpful and SO much fun. The hotel even offered a backup space in case of rain which we luckily didn't have to worry about.

The only requirement for our reception was a $3000 food and beverage minimum, no space fee. We planned to spend around $5000 total, but definitely went over and spent $7400. That price includes all fees, taxes, and gratuity. For our menu, we chose pizza (vegan, regular, and gluten free options), mezze platters, hummus, guacamole and chips, chicken sliders, burger sliders, veggie sliders, mushroom skewers, fries, and a fruit platter. We had MORE than enough food and I feel bad at the amount they had to throw away because we could only take so much with us since we stayed at the hotel. Even though it wasn't fancy, the food was amazing. There were also other food options on the menu that we could have chosen like charcuterie, shrimp cocktail, etc. but we went with our favorite bites. For the bar, we could have served a certain selection or had a pre-set drink menu, but we decided last minute to have an open bar which is how we went over our budget LOL. No regrets, it was honestly the greatest party ever and our friends and family vibed so well it felt like a movie.

**Other random expenses:**  
**Hair** $100 from my regular stylist for basic boho curls and a braid  
**Hotel room** $600  
**Veil** $100 from Etsy WhichGoose  
**Dress** $65 brand new ASOS from Poshmark  
**Shoes** $60 Betsey Johnsoon boots  
**Custom earrings** $80 from Etsy iloniti  
**Suit** $600  
**Rings** $300 for both, using my dads wedding band to create mine  
**Makeup** $0 I did it myself using Elf products

I think overall, we spent closer to $20k when all is said and done since we had our parents in town and we did random things with them. But, I am EXTREMELY PROUD of putting this together and not over spending like crazy. I HIGHLY recommend Perfect Weddings NYC and ART Midtown.

PS I do not have professional photos back yet so enjoy these random ones!

To the point where you just don't want to invest my energy into it anymore?,"I'm really curious to hear both M and F perspectives on this. I'm 23(M). Dating recently has been a STRUGGLE. It's been 3 years since my last relationship. In those 3 years, I've:

\-Worked on myself both alone and in therapy to gain an understanding as to why my last relationship didn't work, including understanding where I went wrong and waiting a good bit to heal before trying my luck at dating again, including understanding that my attachment style needs work.

\-Tried dating people from many different places, hometown, dating apps, meeting people at bars, through friends of friends, classmates, coffee shops, etc.

\-Sprung forward in my career as a professional and started a graduate program at one of the top universities in the United States.

Yet, many of my attempts at relationships fall short, either ghosting, timing issues, or I read the room incorrectly as to what someone's intentions with me actually are. It's caused me to really ask the question, ""Is it actually me? Am I the problem?"" While I'm not perfect (Who is? We're human), I try my best to treat everyone I'm interested in with respect and kindness I bring people flowers picked from my garden and do all the gentlemanly things my mother taught me. I also speak to one person at a time, I have zero interest in having a ""roster"".

I really crave deep and genuine connections in dating. I'm not into the whole ""game"" or whatever people are doing. If I like you, I'll make it known through my actions and words. But that hasn't been working in my most recent attempts. I'm just at a point now where I'm tired of putting my best self forward and not getting anything out of it. Not in an expectation that relationships and connections are transactional, but I'd think after all the work I've put into bettering myself, I'd eventually punch it through? When I ask this question on Google or YouTube, all I get are those incredibly toxic ""dude-bro macho"" self-help videos that just say women are the problem but I have zero interest in consuming that.

1o8euum,https://www.reddit.com/r/NannyEmployers/comments/1o8euum/is_it_me_or_the_nanny/,Is it me or the nanny?,"Hello everyone. I need some advice on our nanny. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads through this very long post!) She has been with us for about 2.5 months and we have very mixed feelings about her performance so far. Our kids are 8 months and 3.5 years (so admittedly tough ages to nanny), she works for us 36-40 hrs per week, M-F, and overall,  she is reliable (she has never called in sick or cancelled last minute. She does frequently show up 5 min late, but we can tolerate that). Also, I work from home, so I see most of what happens on a daily basis.

Initially we had to do some training with her on things like safe breastmilk handling and not feeding the baby to sleep, but now she seems to be good with the 8 month old and we have limited concerns there. However, with our 3.5 year old, they've really struggled to form a relationship and as of two weeks ago, I was ready to make a replacement. The reason I'm now unsure is because my parents have been visiting for the past two weeks and things have seemed to entirely turn around. My mom has been coming over most days our nanny is here and she naturally engages with our 3 yo, so our nanny has had significant help, but our nanny also seems to be engaging more and actually trying to build more of a relationship. I'm wondering if she has watched my mom do it and is using that as a model for her own relationship with our 3yo? 

We were already ready to make a change so we were actively interviewing new nannies and found one we liked, but today our current nanny came in and has been great and I'm just concerned we're making a bad choice to ask our kids to have to get to know someone new. At the same time, I'm really worried that when my parents go back in two weeks, things are going to revert back to where they were. Additionally, I'm concerned we (and especially my husband) are past the point of being able to trust her from a safe decision-making aspect. Below are some of reasons we were ready to make a change until very recently:

* We had a neighbor tell us they saw her and our kids at the park and she was distracted on her phone while our 3 yr ran around ""completely unsupervised"". This was right before my parents arrived, so we have not addressed it yet. We can see the park at a distance from our house, and I did once see them out there and thought there was too much distance between our 3 yo and the nanny. I've never seen her push her on the swing or even stand around on the playground with her while she played. She usually would sit by a tree with the baby, but I couldn't see if she was on her phone. This is probably one of the biggest concerns we have as it's safety related.
* We had a few instances early on that we had to address right away for safety: once she had both kids in the garage with the doors open and she walked back in the house to get her water. While it was quick, my husband saw it and got concerned that our 3 yo was outside alone and could have run into the street or something. Another time, she left our 3 yr old outside in the backyard alone with the doors closed while putting down the baby for 10-15 min. I came downstairs thinking the 3 yr would be on the couch and instead found her in the backyard by herself. We addressed both issues immediately and she has not done it again.
* She frequently wore earbuds while watching our kids and taking them on walks. Sometimes our 3 yo would be playing with playdough or something on the deck and she would be there, but she would just have music playing from her phone, not talking and her earbuds in. (she hasn't done this in the past two weeks with my mom around)
* Most days when she arrived, our 3 yo would hide and cry. Instead of coming over to try to engage her or even play a silly game from afar, she would just completely ignore her for 20-30 minutes. I was trying to limit my visit downstairs because every time I would come down, my daughter would cling to me and our nanny never did anything to try to distract and engage her when it was time for me to go back to work. My daughter never talks about her when she isn't here and sort of seems to ignore her when she is, despite being generally a highly engaged people-kid in most other circumstances 
* Many times I would come downstairs and our 3yo would be laying on the floor, by herself, listening to her toniebox while the nanny was across the room playing with the baby not talking to her at all. In the beginning they would sometimes do crafts, work on a workbook, or bake, but then some weeks, they do none of that and my 3 yo is just by herself the whole day.
* We told our nanny she could have the 3 yo watch some TV while she was putting down the baby if needed, but lately , she seems to turn the TV on after the baby goes down and lets her watch it for up to 30 minutes (again, I chose not to address cause we do let her watch TV and I get our nanny needs breaks sometime too, but I don't love it)
* We have a general lack of trust stemming from some other minor stuff: she wears shoes in our house despite the fact that we don't, we ask our 3 yo to take her shoes off every time we come in, and we showed her where to keep her shoes on the first day. She also spilled a lot of coffee on the carpet one day and tried to clean it up, but there is still a stain and she never brought up that is happened (I saw it on one of the visible cameras we have in our living room). She also forgot to put a smock on our 3 yo one day and her dress what entirely covered in blue acrylic paint, and she never brought up that she forgot or anything like that. This stuff is more minor to me so I chose not to address it; however, if she doesn't bring up the smaller stuff, how do we know she will report the bigger things?

This past week has been like night and day. I saw her playing on the swings with the kids at the park, my toddler actually crawled in her lap today, she is talking to her, Everything seems great. My parents have said they've seen both sides. I'm just worried about making the right choice, and I acknowledge that if we do stay with her I need to do a better job addressing issue as soon as they come up, but that's also a lot of added stress to deal with during the workday and I'm not sure if it's worth it. Any perspective will be helpful here. Thanks!",5,1760640924.0,NannyEmployers,11,0.86,False

I wanted to say from my post from the other day, I'm grateful a few wonderful users have reached out to to me check on me to see if I was/were okay, one awesome/cool person gave me a Sleep Token pick me up line which made my night happy and I really enjoy the Redditors here that reached out to me last night.

Yeah, I simply and truthfully should go out with a bang with awesome/cool introverted friends I've chatted with on this subreddit and I wanted to say I'd hope that keeps on going and you can stick to me like caramel. 

I will close this for the introverts here reading this post as this post is coming to an end, do I really enjoy being an introvert? Would I get out of the gardens of gardens that aren't dripping with caramel because of anxiety being stuck with me? Would I change who I'm as a person?

Well no I simply and truthfully wouldn't, there is one thing nobody has ever gotten from me from Reddit even though people from Reddit think I'm a bot because my lifestyle activities are basically a bot and that's all I'd do is bot my activities daily. However, did you know once I decided to never think that this stage is a prison? 
I once in my 33 years of life wanted to become someone with a social life, go to daily events in my town, try out a job and try to be social. Which yeah, for me ended up being  a terrifying experience, I didn't enjoy myself, I wasn't happy, I didn't feel safe with myself and I would rather be in my complex only coming out only once or twice a week then going back into hiding for a few days and sometimes if the social anxiety is bad I don't go out but once a week.

Wouldn't you want me to feel safe, happy and even if that meant that I had to bot my life every single day with my activities? Cats, naps, Sleep Token lore, music, Skyrim PS4, playing Nintendo Switch games with online friends Co-Op mode tea, sometimes energy drinks, sometimes coffee, YT, watching Sleep Token reels from  a YT content creator that post new Sleep Token reels and what if I told you this made me happy botting my life every single day? Wouldn't you want me happy?
 
I'm also not embarrassed to tell my online introverted friend that I plan on living on SSI and EBT for a very long time, because I don't have the luxury life of my family has gifted me a luxurious garden when they all pass away.

Yeah, with that being said and this post coming to a close don't comment on this post, I don't want people commenting on my posts, I would rather you send me a medium or long winded chat request to keep me engaged and interested in you. How about, you can hit me with your Sleep Token one liners? 

Check out my pinned posts on my profile and social link for more Sleep Token tracks that are a favorite of mine.

(In these days of days) Tell me, did I give you what you came for?

**Why This Pick?**

I am whole-heartedly on the Oilers to win this meeting without the need for OT, friends. The NY Islanders have lost all 3 of their outings so far this season, and to be frank, their offense doesn’t look like anything I want to put money behind having failed to deliver against far worse teams. To boot, New York will be starting their backup Goalie this evening (David Rittich). Edmonton’s offense is arguably the stronger contender; the Oilers have won 2 of their last 3 games. I’m on the visitors to win this matchup in regulation.

Growing up in a Hispanic family, getting evaluated was never even an option. You just got yelled at for not paying attention. I always thought I was lazy or just not smart enough.

In school I was that “wannabe smart guy.” I did just enough to look like I had it together, crammed the night before, turned things in right before midnight, and somehow passed. Fast forward to now, I decided to turn my life around and go to law school. Studying for the LSAT has been a humbling experience. My brain reads a stimulus like it is ancient scripture. By the fifth read the words start floating off the screen like 3D popcorn.

So I finally got evaluated and it turns out I have ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive type. I started on 10mg Vyvanse, then 20mg. Honestly, I did not feel much difference except now I do not need coffee and I am less jittery, which means goodbye to my Starbucks budget. Focus improved a little, but not enough to brag about.

I hit up my doctor again and he bumped me to 30mg. Around that time I saw a TikTok about ADHD testing accommodations for the LSAT and thought maybe that could actually help me.

I asked my doctor about it and this was his response:

>“I have increased your Vyvanse to 30mg. This should help you direct and sustain attention so that accommodations are not required. The time limits exist for a reason. You will not have extra time as a lawyer. You will need to make decisions quickly. So I do not think test-time accommodations are necessary or my place to recommend.”

Basically said, “you will be fine, champ.”

Now I am just sitting here like… bro, I cannot even finish a Reading Comp passage in time without my brain turning into mashed potatoes.

Anyone else ever get this kind of response from their doctor?",3,1760640506.0,LSAT,5,0.67,False
1o8en59,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_WPPMedia/comments/1o8en59/from_screen_to_sale_how_commerce_datadriven/,From screen to sale: How commerce data‑driven targeting is transforming video ads and online shopping,"Ever watched a movie or show and thought, *“I need that outfit”* or *“Where is that gorgeous place?”*

That instant spark of inspiration is exactly what **commerce data‑driven targeting** is designed to capture. This marketing strategy uses **real shopping and browsing data** — from wish lists, carts, and past purchases — to deliver **personalized video ads** at the perfect moment.

# What Is Commerce Data‑Driven Targeting?

It’s a form of **precision advertising** that goes beyond demographics. Instead of guessing what you might like, it uses **actual purchase intent signals** to connect what you see on screen to products or services you’re most likely to buy.

**Examples:**

* Searching for *Scotland tours* → See a tailored travel package during your next streaming session.
* Adding a coffee maker to your cart → Get a special offer in the next ad break.

# Why It Matters for Brands

This approach is turning **cultural moments** into measurable sales:

* **Wicked movie marketing**: 400+ brand collaborations — from Starbucks cups to Lego sets — creating a massive product ecosystem.
* **Gen Z travel trends**: “Set‑jetting” inspired by TikTok and Instagram, driving bookings to destinations seen on screen.
* **Pop culture commerce**: Formula 1 influencing streetwear, Korean dramas shaping global fashion, Taylor Swift’s friendship bracelets going global.

# The Future of Video Advertising

We’re entering an era where **video content is commerce‑connected**. Brands that act in the moment — using **real‑time targeting** and **shopping data** — will lead the market.

I am 5’3” and weigh 226lbs. I am looking to start seeing a dietician again but not sure if my insurance will cover it. I do have some stress eating issues and am seeing a therapist. I am FINALLY making smalls steps to gain momentum for weight loss. I’m taking it very slowly and acknowledging even the small wins on a daily basis and trying to hype myself up that I can do this. I really don’t want my NAFLD to get worse. They already see some scarring on my liver and said it’s really only reversed with weight loss and lifestyle changes. 

What do you think would be a good diet to follow to get my proper nutrients?

My favorite foods that I find myself eating all the time are ice cream, chocolate, chinese food, dumplings, candy, iced coffee from dunkin or starbucks (with the syrups and milk), pasta, and I LOVE diet coke. 

I am working to slow all of these down as I eat them a lot more than I should but how should I work on doing so in a way that won’t make me feel like I’m depriving myself and to do so slowly? 

I want to still allow myself to eat the things I like but in a way that’s healthy and will help me reverse my fatty liver. 

Some of these things like candy and diet coke I would be okay learning to stop completely but I just want to do it the right way. ",1,1760640384.0,WeightLossAdvice,8,1.0,False

I am done.

So my mom (62f) went to the country side with her friend for a vacation. She had a fight with my dad so when her friend invited her, she left. Today, she came back secretly. I (26f) called her I was speaking about a problem I had at uni and jokingly I said “ I shouldn’t listen to you when you told me to go “. And than she told me she is coming and I need to pick her up from the side of the road. (Small detail : my mom doesn’t know how to describe places) . So I was like where exactly and she said “ from the road that leads to the south N2“ and I was like “ but mom you are coming from the north , the N1 that leads to the center so where exactly “ she kept on saying no come to the N2 . So I started referring to different places around that road and I understood what she was talking about. Then when I was going to get her , she call and said don’t come from the shortcut. I was like what shortcut stay where you are I am coming. I started driving she called me again and she knows that I don’t use my phone while i drive, but I pick and told her to stop calling I am on my way. When I reached where she is, I saw her and I was going to pull over. She started screaming. She thought I didn’t see her. I parked the car, came down and started taking care of her luggage and I made a comment “ this is N1 road, You could’ve just told me next to the police station. I would’ve known where you were, but it doesn’t matter let’s go.” When she came into the call she kept on insisting that she’s right and that the road she is referring to is the right . And of course because I’m pissed myself I insisted that I am correct. She started screaming and I started screaming and by the end I just gave up and said OK you are right. OK stop it.

We went back home when we are on the road. She was like because of your attitude. I’m not taking you anywhere, I thought that I was going to tell you let’s go have a coffee together. I was like if you want to let’s go, but if you don’t, let’s go home , it doesn’t matter. I want to have lunch. I didn’t eat anything. I thought that was it but on the road home, she brought up the university problem and she was like I didn’t tell you to do anything. You went by your own choice and I was like I was joking mom I didn’t mean it that way. I was not blaming you. I was just telling you what went wrong with me. Nothing more nothing less. We reached home as usual I took care of her luggage and came in . At this point I shut down so I went to grab the lunch and started eating said nothing. My father and my brother came for greetings. And she started making snippy comments so my brother left but my dad stayed and started joking with her. She went to the kitchen and saw that there is some dishes in the kitchen sink. She came back to the table with me and started making comments. “ why did you leave it that way who is going to clean that up? I’m not cleaning anything. I’m not helping you. I’m going to live just like you. I don’t care.” so I answered her “ I’ll take care of everything. Don’t mind it just sit down and eat with me and that’s enough. Don’t mind anything. It’s our responsibility not yours. One of us will clean it eventually.” She glared at me. She didn’t like that I interfered because she was making these comments to anger, my father. She kept on blaming him because he disrespected her and that he doesn’t appreciate her effort, so that’s why she left. And that she doesn’t cares about us now since we don’t appreciate her efforts and that she had enough. And that each one of us needs to be responsible for their actions. So my dad jokingly said “ don’t eat the food I made” and he was laughing she pushed the dish away and she was like I’m not eating. Mind you I was eating from that dish while everything is happening. I just stood. I’ve had enough at this point. I’ve heard enough snappy  comments so I snapped. What I said was: “Enough that’s enough you came back from a vacation. Go change your clothes. Come eat some food and go rest. enough of these comments enough of this attitude. I thought that you went on a vacation and you are coming back fresh we’re not going through this again. Please stop it for once let’s be a happy family this situation is becoming toxic. I wish for us to be happy all of us.”

And I left the table I went to my room, close the door and just zoned out as usual . But what I said was like poop in the bear. All hell broke loose, and I became the target of her campaign. She started saying that I am a disrespectful b*** who supported my father and who got enough courage to speak to her this way, but didn’t defend her. Let’s just say, she was creative when she was cursing me. She came up twice tried to open the door found it closed. She kept on knocking and by the end I just opened the door . And said :” what you want I said enough of this “. And she kept on screaming at me pushing me trying to slap me. I’m not going to tell you what I said I didn’t curse her couldn’t do that, but I said that I’ve had enough and that we could not carry on leaving this way and that the situation is becoming toxic. It felt like she’s not even listening. She took the keys of my room and she was like those are the locks I bought. Tried to get it back. She started pushing me and trying to bite me. So I tried to get the key and I bited  her too in her hand but I didn’t use force. I Couldn’t get the key so I just grabbed the car key and was leaving. She got me by my hair and I told her to stop. I’m leaving. She was like” not before I do all I want to do” at this point my dad interfered.  he told me to go to my room and for her to stop. at this point, he became the target. When I was going up “ I told her she should’ve not came. If she was going to act this way.” She Started fighting with my father and every time she speaks to me, I would only say stop it enough enough . She said “ no since I am the bad one I’ll make your life miserable you are courageous enough to gang up on me”. I just zoned out, I stop listening and speaking. But I picked some of what she said: How dare I defend my father? How dare I speak to her that way. That I am little b* and a s** . A worthless human and that she will make us miserable. And I will be the first one that she will get rid of.”

I don’t remember everything but I am done. I can’t live the house but I am not going to open my mouth again. Well at least I’m no more going to speak to her since what I say is usually used against me. This is not the first time it happens . I always decide to go mute but I couldn’t. Not gonna lie she’s my mother. I love her . But this is not the first time:

•	⁠16 days after the death of my brother in an accident  she said to me “ dog’s life is long “ while fighting with me because I didn’t clean my room and I was not sad enough for my brother.
•	⁠Once again while fighting she said “ it should have been you “. Those are the times I remember for know. Mind you I saved my second brother from suicide when I was 6 years old and I was blamed for it. And I grow up being responsible for my actions. All while being treated like a failure. And I’m always told that I’m not a good daughter, nor a girl. And by the way, the reason I’m not good at showing my emotions is because when I was 4 years old I was made fun of for crying after falling. So I stopped crying, my tears will fall when I am severally hurt but I will make no sound. I can’t describe how much I wish that I can show my emotions. I can’t tell if I’m happy or not. I’m academically successful but I am not even proud for myself. I am hurt, and done. What I wrote is a drop in a sea of misery. I became uncapable of trusting people , of loving , of speaking. There is no way out. What to do ? I am broke, I am a full time student. the unemployment rate in my country is high. If you study you cannot work and if you work you cannot study. Let’s not speak about the payment that pays for nothing. Even freelancing is impossible because of the economic strategies of my country.

I am lost. I have two bachelor degrees and now I’m working on my master degree in international trade. I’m stuck and I see no way out. I am exhausted. And I don’t like the aggressive person. I’m becoming this is not me. My body hurts. My head hurts my heart. It feels like there is no place for me here as if the world is too small for me.",3,1760640277.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

However, it continues to shock me how many of my 20-something female friends all want children! Like some of these women I grew up with and never remember them saying they wanted children. To each their own, many of them will be great moms and I will do my best to support our friendship when that happens. 

However, there are a few of them where I catch myself doubting whether SHE really wants kids or if it is their partners influencing them. My one friend since kindergarten (27F) had a complicated upbringing, parents had mental health issues, mom is no longer in contact, etc. She got married young and I always assumed it would just be her and her husband due to her situation. We got coffee recently and I jokingly asked her when she is having kids, because everyone asks you that when you get married and I expected her to roll her eyes and tell me to fuck off. Instead, she told me within the next 2 years (?!) I was floored, she has so much going for her career-wise, always talks about wanting to go back to school, and has struggled with body image issues in the past. It just feels like having children would sour those ambitions and also hurt the progress she has made to accept her body. 

Another one of my friends (also 27F) is such a happy-go-lucky person and is high 99% of the time lol. She started dating her boyfriend last year, and told me the last time we got together that they are thinking of marriage and kids within the next couple years. Again, floored! Not only do I struggle to imagine a world where she does not get high for 9 months+, but she is the type to randomly want to go barhopping on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. 

My sister has children and it has definitely affected our relationship, we have to plan for a Friday night childfree dinner & drinks like 3 months in advance. I guess it is hitting me that this will also happen with my friendships, although I am excited to seek out a CF community in the future. I will grieve that fun-loving and flexible nature in my (future) mom friends as I happily sip margaritas on a patio in the sunshine. ",7,1760640094.0,childfree,1,1.0,False

You will make a salary of $500k per year. You will receive a 5% raise for every year of employment. Every year, you receive 3 weeks paid time off, 5 sick days, and standard bank holidays off (Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc.). You also receive standard health benefits. The dress code is business casual. Your shift begins at 9am, and ends at 5pm each weekday (M-F). You are paid bi-weekly (every two weeks). Once per year, there is an all expense paid, 7-day long, company retreat in a foreign country. During the retreat, you will fly first class, stay in luxury accommodations, eat gourmet food with other employees of the company, and participate in optional activities (tours of sites, shows, concerts, cultural experiences, recreational activities like jet skiing, parasailing, etc.). You may bring 1 person of your choosing to the company retreat. Attending the company retreat is optional, but if you chose not to attend, you must work during those 7 days. 
 


However, your work entails staring at a screen, alone in a private office, for 8 hours per day. You have access to a computer, but the only material loaded is written published books (novels, memoirs, biographies, etc.) that were written prior to 1950, which you are welcome to read at your leisure. There are no other features on the computer (internet, note taking, messaging, etc.). However, there is a simple portal where you can type written messages to your manager to ask questions, request time office, etc. You are not permitted to speak to your manager about anything non-work related, and you will never meet them in person. You work in a private, 10x10x10, sound proof, climate controlled office with no windows nor decorations. You must close and lock the door behind you when you occupy your office. A desk, chair, computer, a single power outlet, thermostat, mouse, keyboard, a silent digital clock hanging on the wall, and computer screen are the only objects in the office. The lights cannot be controlled by you, and are on during your entire shift. You can, however, control the temperature within the office. You may not bring anything with you into your office, besides your body and clothing (no phones, other people, music players, books, food, water, coffee, notepads, pillows, blankets, etc.). You may not leave the office except for two snack / water / bathroom breaks (15 min each) and one lunch break (30 minutes), which may be taken at any time during your shift. During your breaks, you may not access your phone, internet, or any other objects (beyond those provided within your office), nor can you leave the building.

There are other people in the office, but they all have the exact same job as you - you may interact with them as you wish during your breaks. There is a small, windowless cafeteria within the building with restrooms, tables, chairs, a clock, sink, a coffee machine, and a fridge filled with pre-packed food items, where you may eat your lunch, socialize, rest, etc. Your break begins the moment you exit your office, and you must be back in your office at the end of the permitted time. 
 


During your time in your private office, you may sit at your desk, move around the room, lay on the ground, sleep, exercise, and really do anything you wish except for tampering with, taking apart, or destroying any of the objects within the room. You are not required to read the material loaded on the computer if you do not want to. 
 


If there is an emergency situation (family emergency, extreme sudden illness, etc.) you will be notified and permitted to leave if you wish. However, if you leave early, this will be deducted from your PTO. You may also take half-days, if desired, but these will also be deducted from your PTO balance. 
 


You must be employed in this role for a minimum of one year. After one year, you may quit at any time and you will keep all earnings.

""You made a mistake.""

""How are you feeling?""

Those words echoed in my head as I woke to someone pounding on my front door. My ears rang and the light stabbed at my eyes. I forced myself upright, still in yesterday's clothes, and stumbled through the hallway feeling like death.

Through the peephole I saw April. She looked awful, covered in scratches and bruises, mud smeared across her arms and face. I opened the door and guided her to the kitchen island.

""Jessica, where have you been?"" She snapped. ""Are you okay?""

I filled a glass of water and handed it to her. ""My head's pounding almost as much as the door was. Why?""

""It's been three days since I last heard from you.""

I started to argue, grabbed my dead phone instead. Three days? No way.

""Between Blake vanishing, you disappearing, and Courtney stalking me,"" she said, ""I'm starting to feel like I'm the only normal one left.""

She collapsed onto a stool, resting her forehead on the cold countertop. I leaned against the back wall, listening to the steady drip of the tap. ""Three days?"" I repeated. ""I don't remember any of it. What happened to you, April? And what do you mean, stalking?""

""She's been... different. Too nice. Like she's trying too hard. I thought she was making up for being such a jerk before, but that wasn't it."" April's voice cracked and tears followed.

I walked behind her and pulled her into a hug. Let her cry. After a few minutes I grabbed a notepad from the drawer. When she noticed, she blinked through tears. ""What are you doing?""

""I've been writing everything down,"" I said. ""All the weird stuff. I filed a missing persons report about Blake and the cops took his journal. The interview the next day was... off."" I gave her a quick up-and-down. ""I've got some things to talk about, too, but I think you should start. From the beginning.""

April nodded silently in agreement. She took a shaky breath.

""It started the day you didn't show up for work. Courtney was at the front desk instead of you. She said you were sick and she'd cover your shift until you got better. That meant sixteen hours straight, and there wasn't a hint of dissatisfaction in her voice.""

""I never told her I was sick,"" I said quietly, setting the kettle on the stove.

April kept going. ""All day she stayed within ten feet of me. Peeking around corners, restocking shelves, pretending to work on the laptop. Whenever she spoke, she got too close, smiling wide, showing all her teeth. They weren't white anymore. They'd gone yellow, like she'd been chain smoking for decades. And she doesn't even smoke.""

The kettle screamed. I poured her coffee and handed it over.

""The worst part was the smell,"" she said. ""Overpowering. Sickly sweet. Like her blood had turned to syrup. I gagged every time she leaned in. She kept repeating the same fake cheerful lines, like a record skipping. I avoided her as much as I could, but when I clocked out she was waiting by the door, smiling that same awful smile. Didn't say a word. Just watched me leave.""

I joined her at the island, tea in hand.

""I had some running around I needed to do after work,"" she began, her voice still shaky, ""and by the time I was finished shopping in the plaza, it was pretty dark out. I headed over to my car, and there she was, leaning against the front-passenger door.""

Her hands trembled around the coffee cup. ""She was still smiling, but this time she was breathing heavy, like she'd just sprinted across the parking lot to get to me. She said, 'It's cold. Can you take me home?' But she wasn't cold, Jessica. She was sweating, like she was overheating. That same thin orange film that coated the journal covered her arms and neck. I could smell her before I even reached the car. It was that same syrupy smell from work, only stronger. I thought I was going to be sick.""

April looked down, eyes unfocused. ""I ignored her. I made for the driver's side as fast as I could, unlocked the door, jumped in. Just as I was about to drive away, she grabbed the handle on the passenger side and started pulling. The door was locked, but she kept tugging, her face pressed up against the glass, still smiling, still panting. Her breath fogged the window, and I could see the sweat dripping down her temple. That smell... it filled the car somehow, like it seeped through the vents. It was everywhere.""

She took a deep breath that came out ragged. ""I slammed my foot on the gas and tore out of there. I didn't even look back at first. I just wanted to get home, to get away from her. But something made me glance at the mirror. I wish I hadn't.""

April's fingers dug into her thighs. Her face twisted as she spoke. ""She was still hanging on, Jessica. She was holding onto the car door, her body slamming against the road. I could hear it, this wet, horrible sound every time she hit the asphalt. She was looking up into the side mirror, staring right into my eyes like she'd been waiting for me to notice her.""

She swallowed hard. ""I slammed the brakes. The car screeched, and she flew off, tumbling into the ditch. I threw open the door and leaned out, waiting, hoping she'd move or yell or something. I just wanted proof she was still alive.""

""Jesus,"" I whispered, my mind drawing a blank. She kept going.

""Then she crawled out,"" April said, her voice barely holding together. ""She crawled out of that ditch and back onto the road. Her arms were broken, Jessica. I could see the bones hooking into the asphalt like claws as she dragged herself forward. And for some reason, I thought she needed help. I unbuckled my seatbelt and started to go to her, but... it was a trick. When I got close enough, she jumped up on all fours and charged at me, smiling that same awful smile, teeth yellow and shining in the headlights. I barely made it back to the car. Slammed the door, locked it, hit the gas. She just stood there as I drove away, still smiling, still watching me until she disappeared in the dark.""

The room went quiet except for the ticking of the clock. I rubbed her shoulder gently, but there was nothing I could say that would make sense of what she'd seen.

As I did, her expression changed. Her face went pale, her eyes wide. She stared at me like she'd just realized something awful.

""You smell sweet,"" she said softly. ""Jessica... you smell sweet.""

She pushed off the stool, stumbling backward. Her hand hit the wall behind her. Then she slid down to the floor, still staring at me, breathing fast, like she didn't know whether to run or scream.

1o8ectw,https://www.reddit.com/r/sociology/comments/1o8ectw/help_choosing_which_professors_to_ask_for/,Help choosing which professors to ask for sociology PhD rec letters,"Hi everyone, I’d really appreciate some advice on which combination of recommenders makes the most sense for my sociology PhD applications. For context I graduated with a BA in sociology this year from a T25 US university and I'm currently working in finance. My research interest is in political sociology with a regional interest in the middle east.

I need to choose three recommenders:

1. Professor #1: Assistant Professor of Sociology at my university. He taught me an intro level sociology course and was my thesis advisor so he knows me/my work very well as we worked closely together for a year. He did his PhD at my top choice university and is well known in that department. We also share the same research focus in political sociology and the Middle East. The only downside is that he is still early in his career.
2. Professor #2: Assistant Professor of Political Science/Middle Eastern Studies at my university. I took a class with her in my senior year and she offered to write me a rec letter if I decided to apply to grad school. She knows me really well (she read my whole thesis!) and has a reputation for writing the best recommendation letters at my university. The downside is that she is also early in her career and her background is in political science rather than sociology, though she does have a regional focus on the Middle East. She is not super well known academically but she's quite famous on Twitter (if that matters lol) and writes for major outlets like the NYT and Time Magazine.
3. Professor #3: She is an emerita professor of anthropology and cultural studies at my university with a regional focus on North Africa. I took a class with her during my freshman year right before she retired, and it was probably my favorite class in undergrad. My final project for that class turned out great and she sent me a really sweet email about how much she loved it. We have met for coffee once or twice every year since then, and she knows me very well, though she is probably not as familiar with my recent work as my other professors. She is well known in her field, an excellent writer, and could speak well about my character and intellectual curiosity. Also she's a super sweet person in general.
4. Professor #4: He is a very famous sociology professor from another university (Top 5) and currently serves as the department chair. I took a two-week intensive class abroad with him 2.5 years ago when he was a visiting professor at my university. I did really well in his class and we had a few good conversations, but I have not spoken to him since. His name would carry a lot of weight as he's one of the most famous sociologists alive, although his subfield is different from mine and his letter might not be very detailed since we have not kept in touch. I would need to reach out and catch up over Zoom so he can get a better idea of what I have been doing since then. There is also a chance he could say no since he is probably very busy and/or he might not even remember me at all.
5. Professor #5: He is the second most senior sociology professor in my department and works in the same subfield of political sociology. He was the thesis advisor of the person who now chairs the sociology department at one of my top-choice programs. He is tenured and fairly well known-- definitely not as famous as Professor #4 but I'd say his name still carries a lot of weight. I did well in his class and we had a few good conversations, but he always intimidated me a bit since he is a very serious old guy. I am not sure how strong an impression I left, but I think he would agree to write me a letter. He does not know me personally beyond class and a few essays I wrote for him, so he is not very familiar with my recent work or who I am outside the classroom. I could reach out and invite him for coffee to reconnect.

Inside the secretive and strict PLYMOUTH BRETHREN CHRISTIAN CHURCH (Exclusive Brethren)
By: Bill Redekop May. 10, 2014","**The closed-door church: Part 2**

**Inside the secretive and strict Plymouth Brethren sect in Manitoba**

**By: Bill Redekop May. 10, 2014**

To really find out what is happening with the PBCC I had to telephone London, England to speak with Eileen Barker, professor emeritus of sociology of religion at the London School of Economics.

Barker came into contact with Plymouth Brethren about a decade ago through an organization she started called INFORM (Information Network Focus on Religious Movements), a charitable organization that provides information on religious groups. The Brethren approached her about doing a study for them. She declined, but she was interested in meeting them and staying in contact.

“I went to their houses, they came to my house fairly frequently, I went to some of their services, and I got to know some of them fairly well,” she said. “When I go to their houses, they’ve given me a very nice plate of food in another room (separate from the Brethren). They don’t eat in my house but recently they did have a cup of coffee, which they didn’t do five or six years ago.”

“They’re delightful people to talk to when you just sort of meet them or go into their homes. There’s nothing strange or weird about them. They’re polite, they play games, they drink. One family I’ve been to quite a lot, the children are very musical.”

She also found out “they’re pretty rich.” Few people live alone, perhaps only widows. “Old people move either into a part of the house, a granny quarter, or in a small house nearby, perhaps in the garden,” she said.

“If you obey the rules and show up to church and do everything, you’re all pretty well protected as for as your material needs.”

Barker points out there have been positive changes in the Brethren. About a decade ago, there was something called a “review,” where Brethren visited former members to apologize for past treatment and urge them to return to the church. The review, decreed by their Man of God, was an acknowledgement that the Brethern may have been too severe in the past.

“They had a period where they were very, very exclusive and they’ve apologized for that to many people,” Barker said.

For Danylchuk in Winnipeg, this led to her first contact with her mother and siblings in the Brethren in 25 years. All they could do was talk on the phone; her family had been relocated to Montreal to shore up the congregation there.

“It really isn’t much of a relationship other than that,” she said, but she still appreciates it.

Admiraal also received an apology but then never heard from the Brethren again. Like most ex-Brethren, Admiraal felt the review was little more than a feeble one-off.

As for university, Brethren leadership still doesn’t support it.

“I suspect it’s more because they fear they might lose people,” said Barker. But the leadership is permitting some tertiary education in such things as accounting, which can benefit their small businesses.

Brethren are becoming adept at working with computers, Barker said. When she mentioned she couldn’t get her printer working, they showed up the next day and fixed it for her.

“It’s possible for them to change, and they have changed,” Barker said.

Some of the change is coming because of external pressures, however. The biggest influence in recent years has been a legal battle in the United Kingdom.

The fight erupted when the Charity Commission for England and Wales wanted to take away the charity tax exemption enjoyed by the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church.

*As the legal battle played out, it became clear that not only could the U.K. Charities Commission find no public good performed by the Plymouth Brethren, it found plenty of bad.*

 

The job of the commission is to make sure any group that receives tax exemptions due to its charity status is actually doing work for the public good.

The commission could find no public good that the PBCC performed to obtain its charity tax exemption. In fact, any funding raised by Plymouth Brethren went to the church itself to be spent on things like building private schools.

“We were told not to give to charities,” said one former member in Manitoba.

The Brethren fought back with some of the best lawyers in the U.K. The charity tax break is a massive source of income for the Brethren. If it were overturned, they would have to start paying tax on tens of millions of dollars worth of properties in England and Wales. Donations to its church and schools would no longer be exempted from taxes.

The legal fight lasted two years. As the battle played out, it became clear that not only could the Charities Commission find no public good performed by the Plymouth Brethren, it found plenty of bad. It chastised the church for “elements of detriment and harm which emanated from the doctrine and practices of the PBCC and which had a negative impact on the wider community as well as individuals so as to present a real danger of outweighing public benefit.”

It also scolded the PBCC for its disciplinary practices and the impact they have on people who leave.

However, the commission also noted the PBCC indicated a willingness to make changes. When the commission came down with its ruling at the start of 2014, it agreed to extend charitable status for a trial period on certain conditions. In other words, the commission put the PBCC into a version of a “shutting up” phase.

The major condition is that the PBCC must show greater compassion. “No action should be taken in any way to treat vindictively, maliciously or unfairly persons whether within or outside the community, including those who were within the community and who are leaving or have left the community.”

Another clause states that PBCC must provide to people who seek to leave its community “reasonable assistance… in terms of support and/or financial assistance.”

Perhaps the clincher is this provision: “Reasonable steps should also be taken in these cases to allow the continuation of family relationships where a family member has left the community, including providing access to family members, in particular children.”

The ruling left the PBCC with a choice: doctrine or tax exemptions. It is believed to be modifying its doctrine to keep the tax exemptions, but proof will be in the pudding.

“From my perspective, I thought it rather good, because it’s encouraging them to move in a direction I approve of, encouraging them to be more open,” said Barker. The Canada Revenue Agency has announced it is also reviewing the tax exemption status of Canadian charities, including religious groups. However, critics maintain the Harper government is just using the review as a witch hunt of NGOs that have been critical of the Conservative government.

The CRA recently threatened to pull its charity tax exemption from the Canadian Mennonite magazine. The CRA maintained an article about Mennonite youth urging the federal government to spend less money on war, engaged in “partisan political activities.”

“They do their own thing but if I see them on the street, they stop and talk to me,” said Don Walsh, reeve of the RM of Woodlands, speaking of the Plymouth Brethren in the community. “They won’t mix with the community but will do anything for the community that pertains to community.”

Woodlands, about 35 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg, is undergoing a housing boom thanks to Plymouth Brethren who are moving in from Australia and New Zealand. It’s something the PBCC does, moving Brethren around to either create new communities, like in Stonewall, or prop up old ones, like Woodlands.

Brethren, though the grocer says other locals have taken a shine to the imports as well.

Across Canada, PBCC communities have also set up in Montreal, Toronto, Hamilton, Guelph, St. Catherines, London, Tillsonburg, Woodstock, Perth, Kingston, Regina, Oxbow, Maple Creek, Calgary, Edmonton, Abbotsford, and Vancouver.

Besides Neche, Plymouth Brethren are also located in Pembina, N.D., and in St. Vincent, Minn.

In Woodlands, the Brethren are building large, beautiful homes in town, many of them two-storey, in contrast to the older, existing bungalows in the village. One of the new Brethren homes has eight bedrooms. There are about four building starts right now.

About half of the 500 inhabitants of Woodlands are Brethren, Walsh said.

“They are good neighbours,” he maintained. “You always hear people say they’re going to take the town over. They actually came to me and said they’d heard the rumour and that wasn’t their intent.”

The economic activity is welcome. Northstar Enterprises, a Brethren business that builds cattle corrals, employs about 35 people, both Brethren and non-Brethren. It is currently located in a bunch of old Quonset huts on a farm, but the company plans to build a facility in town in a few years.

“This group here seem to have lots of money. They hire locals. They’re good for the economy,” Walsh said.

Brethren have also provided an economic boost in Stonewall. Bedroom communities don’t have the kind of light manufacturing companies the PBCC have started. The companies make everything from security doors and shutters, to school furniture, such as desks and chairs, much of which is sold to First Nations.

There are about 20 Brethren businesses in Stonewall, alone. Stonewall Mayor Ross Thompson estimates they add about $800,000 a year in tax revenue to the town’s coffers.

“They’ve had a considerable impact on the town from a business standpoint, and from a civic standpoint in being good citizens,” he said. For example, Brethren helped out when the Quarry Park Interpretive Centre burned down, supplying a temporary building and some office furniture. Thompson estimated there are 50 to 60 Brethren families in Stonewall now. “They’re an asset to the community,” he said.

The PBCC influence is noticed elsewhere.

The Family Foods in Stonewall has a section of British products expressly for its Plymouth Brethren clientele.

It includes Duerr’s Mincemeat, Daddies Tomato Ketchup, Baxter’s Victorian Chutney, and HP sauce in both pepper and fruity flavours. The store has Best of Britain tags, with the British Ensign on them, to delineate the products. Many of the products are at the request of the expatriated British citizens, said store manager Dave Kalnuk.

As ex-members point out, the Plymouth Brethren can’t be blamed for being born into a conservative religion that controls their entire life from birth to death, and provides them with little means to survive in the outside world. To leave the church means giving up so much.

Is it a cult?

Lorne Dawson, a sociologist at University of Waterloo who has studied cults, said the Brethren display many of the same features as other extremist religions, including being “infused with the apocalyptic element,” such as the rapture.

But he wouldn’t go as far as to call the Brethren a cult. “’Cult’ is usually a word just to beat people over the head with. There’s absolutely no positive connotation to the word. It’s just a nasty label,” he said. Neither is there universal agreement on a definition for cult.

He prefers to say the Plymouth Brethren are “a sectarian group that is displaying cult-like features.”

“They are acting more extreme in their behaviour in terms of control over membership, in separating from the world, and in a focus on a special leader. These are characteristic themes in a cult,” he said.

People in Manitoba who know about the Brethren reflexively compare them to Hutterites, Old Order Mennonites and Amish.

It’s certainly not a fair comparison with Hutterites. Hutterites have something similar to the “shutting up” phase when a member has done something wrong, called an *ausschluss* for grave sins, and *unfrieden* for lesser sins. But it’s extremely rare for a Hutterite to be kicked out.

There are ex-Hutterites, but they left on their own accord. As devastating as that is to the immediate family and colony, ex-Hutterites still return to visit their home colonies. Ex-members will even stay for several days on a colony, although that can vary between colonies, said Mark Waldner, a teacher at Decker Hutterite Colony in western Manitoba.

Hutterites also believe in separation — but separation from the sinful elements of the outside world, said Waldner, not a total separation like the Brethren. And while Hutterites do have a leader, called the Elder, he’s currently a 93-year-old man who is losing his eyesight and lives in a common home like other Hutterites, not in a mansion with his own private jet.

While researching the website of the International Cultic Studies Association, I came across a paper presented by a professor Peter Caws. I was struck by this quote: “If the Taylorite Exclusive Brethren (another name for the Plymouth Brethren) were just a harmless evangelical sect, seeking to be faithful to the gospel, they would deserve our respect and might be left to work out their own salvation. But this description will not fit.”

Did he mean the Brethren are harmful? I asked Caws, professor of philosophy at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and a former Plymouth Brethren member from England.

Yes, he said. Caws maintains the PBCC victimizes the people who are born into it.

“The harm comes to their own members. They’re not a threat in the world with what, 46,000 members,” he said in a telephone interview.

“The harm has been extreme. Many, many families broken up. A good many people killed themselves. The minute they deviate from their doctrine, they’re out the window… They’re out on their ear and they’re in terrible shape.”

Caws left England to study in the United States and never saw his parents again. He’s 82 now, so that was obviously a long time ago. When he grew up, the Plymouth Brethren was a fairly normal evangelical fundamentalist Christian church. But Caws, like others, blames Taylor Jr. for hijacking the church and turning it into an extremist group.

The Brethren church was fine so long as benign leaders ran it, but once a malevolent personality like Taylor Jr. got in, the group was defenceless, Caws said. There was nothing in its structure to counteract him.

Caws described Taylor Jr. as having an “authoritarian personality who had to have someone obey him and obey blindly. Anyone who deviated a little bit got disciplined.

“No one was in a position to challenge the authority and the only way was to get out, but that meant you lost your family and job.”

Little has changed under successors John Hales, followed by his son Bruce — both business people who “saw opportunities,” in Caws’ words.

Jill Aebi-Mytton, a counselling psychologist in London, England, recently did a large-scale study of the mental health of former PBCC members.

[Jill Abei-Mytton](https://preview.redd.it/kv8ayq7qpivf1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3676ff4c673b00a5eb157bd9b5e16df993e7213)

Aebi-Mytton was raised a Plymouth Brethren. Her parents left when she was 16, but not everyone got out. Her older brother stayed in. An aunt and uncle also stayed in. Curiously, the aunt and uncle were part of the group that relocated to Stonewall in 2003 to start a new Plymouth Brethren church. They came from Liverpool. They were at quite an advanced age to be called upon by their church to relocate, and died within a few years.

Aebi-Mytton doubts much change will come from the Charities Commission ruling in her country. She wanted the case to go to a public tribunal with personal testimonies. “We wanted the detriment and harm to be made public rather than kept private and concealed,” she said. Instead, the commission only accepted written witness statements.

Even so, there was much to like in the ruling. “It is an extraordinary situation that (the Charities Commission) has to tell a church to show compassion. It’s quite unprecedented, really.” But there are also questions about how much power the Charities Commission has to enforce its ruling, she said.

Her study found people who leave the Brethren or are withdrawn from are poorly equipped to make their way in the outside world,. Many suffer traumatic symptoms such as nightmares, intrusive thoughts, distressing memories and flashback. Sixty-four per cent of those she surveyed had sought professional help from psychologists or counsellors.

“It’s a massive trauma, leaving. It requires a lot of guts and resilience. The ones with the most resilience make it, and those with less don’t.”

Among the 264 ex-members surveyed, more than half had children or parents still in the Brethren; 68 per cent had brothers or sisters in and 23 per cent had grandparents in.

Did they ever see them?

The survey found 64 per cent of respondents saw their family in the Brethren either never or less than once a year; 60 per cent said they want more contact but are refused; and nearly all of the rest, 35 per cent said, neither side wants contact.

Aebi-Mytton recalled her own family experience with the Brethren. Relations between her and her parents, and her brother, have been continuously estranged. He once called her “the epitome of evil.” But she knows how much it pained her mother to lose her son and not be able to have contact with him.

“It’s like a living death. It’s like they’re dead to them but not dead,” she said.

“Once someone dies, you can grieve. You get to point where you still feel sad but it’s OK. But when they’re still alive, you don’t reach that point. You can’t grieve them because they’re still alive. My mother used that term. ‘It’s like the living dead.’”

**Note:** The Plymouth Brethren Christian Church has, through their lawyers, raised concerns about portions of this article.  As noted in the article, members of the Church declined to be interviewed by the *Free Press*.  However, the Free Press has learned that a response to the article has been posted on the Church [**web site**](http://www.plymouthbrethrenchristianchurch.org/winnipeg-free-press-plymouth-brethren-response/).

 

**Brethren’s business impact**

There are a remarkable number of Brethren-owned family businesses in Manitoba for a religious sect of just 450 members.

The Free Press counted at least 25 small businesses, and there are undoubtedly more. It’s not clear why members of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church are so successful in business. That companies can receive interest-free loans through Brethren might be part of the answer.

Business is a big part of being a Brethren today. Virtually all Brethren work for companies owned by Brethren families. However, PBCC doctrine stipulates that companies stay small.

Winnipeg companies owned by Brethren members include Acure Medical Equipment, Officescape, and Central Dental Supply Ltd., all owned by John Haldane; Applifast Inc.; Insign Architectural Signage; Chemwest Supply; Van Extras; FRS Group Inc.; Acure Safety; Insta-Foil Specialties; Acculift Airmax Inc; Excel Interiors; Meditek; Western Enivronmental Canada, and NP2 (an advertising agency).

In Stonewall, Brethren own at least half the industrial park off Highway 67. Like elsewhere, they do not belong to the local chamber of commerce because that is forbidden. Stonewall companies include Accent Group; Mitybilt Products Inc; Paragon Securities; Arrow Specialties; Lakeland Group and Universal Business Team.

Woodlands-area companies include Northstar Enterprises and Arrow Farmquip, and North American Rail Products Inc. is next door in Argyle.",2,1760639721.0,cults,0,1.0,False

At my lowest weight I was 147. I've reintroduced carbs (rice and veggies only for the most part) and now I'm up in weight to 160lbs. Mentally I know it's probably just water weight for most of it, but it still messes with my brain to see weight go up that fast.

For my diet, I'm doing 2700-3000 calories a day, trying to stay in a clean bulk. I'm eating chicken, rice, veggies, oats, coffee, eggs, banana and on my lift days I have a protein shake before the gym.

I'm doing a 4 day a week split, Monday is chest/back, Tuesday is a 5k jog, Wednesday is arms and shoulders, Thursday is rest, Friday is ab/legs, and weekends are rest. I typically do about 8 excersies per session, 4 sets of around 10-20 reps. I'm semi experience at the gym, I used to go back before I had a motorcycle crash that messed up my elbow a bit, but that was about 5 years ago so consider me a beginner.

Basically my meals look like this.

Four scrambled eggs with coconut oil instead of butter, cups of mixed veggies, a cup of coffee, and a half cup of oats (measured dry) for breakfast.

Lunch is 9 oz of chicken breast, 1 cup of rice, 1.5 cup of mixed veggies

On workout days, I have a scoop of protein shake mix with a cup of coffee and a banana 30 minutes before my workout.

Then for dinner I round out my macros with whatever proportions of rice and chicken and veggies I need to hit my calories. Mainly focusing on the chicken.

I'll also add that my main goal is to build muscle. I'm not going for ""juiced out bodybuilder"", just over all muscle so I can cut next year and get lean. I work an active job at a service station working with tires, changing oil, and doing brake jobs, so strength will come from that.

I will update pictures in a year, but here is me at my heaviest back in high school, around 10 years ago, versus me at right now. 

Any advice that people can give me would be welcome. I haven't done any serious gym work in like 5 years, I had to stop after a motorcycle crash screwed my left elbow. After work today I can post my full routine that I do.

Wouldn't you want me to feel safe, happy and even if that meant that I had to bot my life every single day with my activities? Cats, naps, Sleep Token lore, music, Skyrim PS4, playing Nintendo Switch games with online friends Co-Op mode tea, sometimes energy drinks, sometimes coffee, YT, watching Sleep Token reels from  a YT content creator that post new Sleep Token reels and what if I told you this made me happy botting my life every single day?

Id be looking for work near where ever we live.

We really like running so would like trails or at least sidewalks nearby. We also like taking our kid to the playground, so one within walking distance would be amazing. Also a bigger fan of local businessess instead of chains. Altho we do love Winco and Costco. An active library or downtown with coffee shops and stores would be great. We've been looking at West Seattle, love the large parks near Kirkland/Redmond, but also have heard good things about Maple Leaf, the areas just north of Ballard, and Central District.

Each time this is mentioned I get a literal panic attack.

I decided to just send the questions out via email and hope for the best because having four reviews in person within 2 weeks scares me to death. Now one of them – the person I was most scared asking because I’ve noticed they think I’m a bit weird and annoying and I find their communication style confusing but they’re the one stake holder I work the most with – said they’d prefer doing this over coffee so they could give me context face to face.

Chances I’m going to cry or hyperventilate are huge and I definitely don’t feel comfortable around them to be vulnerable. I do feel safe with my team because they know I have anxiety (didn’t tell them I’m autistic because at other jobs this caused discrimination) but not with this person. I don’t want to damage the relationship either by jumping to conclusions and thinking they hate me because we have to work together a lot. 

On top of this is the actual big performance review itself. Each time our CEO emails about it I get ridiculously scared.

I work long days in construction and have completely lost track of what and when I eat or drink. I’m overweight and pretty unhealthy.

I barely have time to prepare meals or make food in the morning, so I usually stop by a store to grab a coffee, a yogurt drink, and some pastry from the bakery. For lunch, it’s often pizza or a burger, and at home I just have a simple dinner with my wife. I drink almost no water or anything else throughout the day — only at home.

I’m honestly so fed up with this routine, especially because I don’t even care what I eat anymore. I just feel that hunger, and it has to be something warm or sweet.

On construction sites there’s almost no way to heat up food.

I’m thinking about getting some kind of thermal food container and a few canned soups that I actually like, plus a thermos for tea — since I usually have just enough time in the morning to heat those up.

https://reddit.com/link/1o8e4rf/video/gszia0ornivf1/player

Alright y’all… I’ve been on the eternal quest to make AI writing sound *actually human*. Between essays, freelance gigs, and side projects, I use ChatGPT a ton — but every time I ran my text through an AI detector, it lit up like a Christmas tree 🎄.

That’s when I stumbled across **TwainGPT**. I saw a few posts calling it one of the best tools to *humanize AI writing*, so I figured I’d give it a try. Here’s my honest **TwainGPT review** after testing it myself — and whether I think **TwainGPT is legit** or just hype.

# 💭 Why I Tried TwainGPT in the First Place

I wanted something that could **humanize AI text undetectably** — quick, smooth, and accurate. TwainGPT looked promising: clean website, bold claims, and reviews that said it could “make any AI writing 100% human.”

So I tested it on a few ChatGPT essays and blog posts. I really wanted it to be “the one.”

# ⚙️ My Actual Experience Using TwainGPT

TwainGPT’s interface is nice and simple — paste your text, hit *Humanize*, and boom 💥 it spits out a rewritten version. My first impression? Not bad. It definitely made the writing flow a little better and fixed a few robotic phrases.

But then I ran the results through **GPTZero**, [**Originality.ai**](http://Originality.ai), and **Sapling**... and yeah, it still got flagged 🚨. Some sentences passed, others didn’t. The biggest issue was consistency — one output would sound super natural, the next would read like a weird AI trying too hard to be “quirky.”

Also, it occasionally changed the meaning of my sentences or added random filler words. It felt less like “humanizing” and more like “rephrasing with personality.” For something that costs what it does, I expected a bit more reliability.

# 🔥 What Happened When I Switched to [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai)

After getting tired of hit-or-miss results, I started checking out alternatives and found[ ](https://grubby.ai)Grubby AI — a tool people on Reddit kept recommending for making AI writing *completely undetectable*.

I dropped the *same exact* text into [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai), and the difference was night and day 🌙. The output sounded smooth, natural, and totally human — like something I could’ve written myself after two cups of coffee ☕.

Then came the real test: I ran it through *every* major detector again… **zero AI flags**. Not even one. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) actually delivered on what TwainGPT promised — it didn’t just rewrite my text, it *humanized* it in a believable, consistent way.

If you’re searching things like *“humanize AI content”*, *“humanize ChatGPT text”*, or *“AI to humanize text”*, [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is hands down the best **AI bypass tool** I’ve used.

# 🧩 Final Thoughts

So, **is TwainGPT legit?** Sort of. It works okay for quick paraphrasing, but it’s not reliable if your goal is to make AI text undetectable. It feels more like a stylistic rewriter than a true humanizer.

Meanwhile, [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai) actually *gets it right* ✅. It keeps your tone, passes all detectors, and makes AI writing sound authentically human every single time.

If you’re serious about writing that *passes as human*, don’t waste time on tools that half-deliver. [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) is where it’s at 👑.

# TL;DR:

Tried **TwainGPT** — it sorta worked, but my text still got flagged and lost my original tone. Switched to [**Grubby.ai**](http://Grubby.ai), and now everything I write passes every AI detector with ease. If you want to **humanize AI text undetectably**, go with [Grubby.ai](http://Grubby.ai) 💯.

1o8e4i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1o8e4i0/sleep_deprivation_with_a_toddler/,Sleep deprivation with a toddler,"Edit: I've only been taking Dandelion Root Extract for a few weeks now. It is a diuretic, but hasn't made much of a difference in my already frequent and urgent urination. 

Age 33F, 5'8, 153 lbs. Diagnosed with GAD, ADHD, insomnia, Hashimoto's antibodies present (very low, will develop at some point in my life as all the other women in my family have). Not taking any medications. Supplements include fenugreek, astaxanthin, selenium complex a few times a week, dandelion root extract.

*Relevant info: I drink a lot of coffee (3-5 cups before noon). I always have, since a young teen. It was my first form of self-medication for ADHD prior to stimulants (I have not used stimulants in almost four years).

Hello. I'm looking for some insight into how to manage sleep deprivation. A little backstory: I have an almost 22 month old toddler boy (height 36""; weight 26 lbs; not taking any medication, has a CMPA) that DOES NOT sleep. Seriously. We've gotten a few five hour stretches out of him, tops. Most nights he's waking up 3-6 times per night. I'm working on his end. He's EBF, doesn't attend childcare, I'm a SAHM, and we bedshare at this point in time. I have my thoughts, our pediatrician has her thoughts, we're trying to work out a system (his dad has tried a few times to care for him when he wakes, but he screams bloody murder until he's literally tucked into my bosom, boob in mouth). Against CIO for now, so please don't suggest that.

My concern lies with my insomnia. If I have to get out of the bed, for any reason, I am awake. The time of day or night, or prior quality and quantity of sleep, being irrelevant. This is especially true of naps. I was once a great napper and lover of naps. Prior to my son, I would nap as frequently as I could due to my nighttime insomnia. Now, even if I was awake every hour or two the night before, or running on 3-5 hours of sleep, I CANNOT nap. My brain simply will not shut off. I've done all of the things: blackout curtains, white noise, cool room, zero lights, breath work, counting backwards from 1,000, etc. Nothing will help my brain to shut down. This has been happening everyday since my son was one month old. On top of that, literally every time I lie down, I have to pee within 30 minutes, disrupting any sleepiness I might have been feeling (to note: baby was a Cesarean, my pelvic floor is fine, bladder looks normal, bloodwork good). I also developed nocturia 5 month PP. Never woke up to urinate at night, not once, even during the worst of my insomnia. 

I feel like I'm dying. My chest hurts all the time. I'm irritable, low-energy, appear to be rapidly aging, and I'm so rageful, especially at night when my boy is struggling extra hard to sleep, and I have so much guilt and fear from that. 
Is it the caffeine, my one and only lifeline in many ways at this time in my life? Is it hormonal? Is it the night feeding and bedsharing that is disrupting both of our sleep (again, working on that part over the next few months)? 

I fall asleep great now, and can go back to sleep if it's a stirring for the breast, just not the getting up, lengthy crying, or trying to nap. 

TIA! I feel like a psycho and desperately need some guidance. ",1,1760639290.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1. Coffee

3. Trunativ Sugar/ whatever sweetner you guys use. 


I usually love butterscotch coffee or hazelnut one so beat/mix the coffee and sugar together in warm water until it turns brown/dark brown. Before you add amul milk, try shaking it in a shaker and then pour it over ice and coffee. 


Probably thick and super creamy cold coffee you’ll ever have. I consume it twice a day, it’s that tasty lol! Hoping this helps you consume your remaining amul high protien milk.

Ive struggled with ADHD since diagnosed at age 13 ( over 25 years ago). I was never medicated, but should have been. My time in school, grades, and probably life thereafter would have been smoother.

I’ve been struggling with binge eating disorder for the last 2.5 years after a SA. I had severe ptsd symptoms, and then binge episodes. I’ve been in DBT and in EMDR, which has helped. I put on 110 lbs in 18 months, lost a lot of sleep (binging at night), putt thousands of $ on credit cards to pay for food. My BED has caused suicidal thoughts as well.

A psychiatrist put me on Vyvanse, for both BED and ADHD, and it’s changed my life. My binge episodes have significantly decreased to almost nothing, and it’s also improved my ADHD symptoms immensely. My daily life is a world away from what it was. I am organized, motivated, efficient, and functional in my home life and job life. My BED has largely stopped, annd have now improved my finances, health, and marriage. I’m on a low dose still, as well, just 30 mg, and feel no need to increase. I’ve only been on it for a few months. I have hope again, and am putting the pieces of my life back together.

I started developing pain, pressure, in my bladder and urethra, a few weeks after starting Vyvanse, and a sense that I need to go quite frequently. My bladder at times feels hard as a rock. I’ve been tested several times for uti, also checked for vaginal infections, even had imaging done, and all were negative. My Gyn suggested tapering off the vyvanse to see if symptoms improved and they did. Once I went back on, the symptoms returned. I tried lowering to 20 mg, but I still have urinary symptoms. If I take one day on and one day off, I don’t have symptoms, but if I take it 2 days in a row, I do. I’ve even weaned off coffee and any tea or excess sugar hoping that will improve things, but it hasn’t.

I’m feeling incredibly hopeless at the moment. Will all the stimulant medications cause this? Are there any stimulants that are less likely to cause this than others?

I have tried clonidine and straterra as well for adhd in the past. Stattera had a mild effect on adhd, but caused severe constipation requiring enemas. Clonidine made me very tired, helped with anxiety but not adhd symptoms. Neither had any impact on binging.

Both my issues have done a complete 180 on this medication, and I’m feeling really hopeless at the moment thinking I’ll have to stop. Any suggestions welcome.",1,1760638834.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

It was on her third day at her new job that Katherine first noticed the strange occurrences at the orphanage. It started with little things, like a light shiver running down her spine or a sudden all-encompassing fear that would shoot through her body whenever she walked past the locked room on the top floor. Though back then, she had thought nothing of it, choosing to focus on her job instead. However, soon, the strange occurrences seemed to become bigger or stronger, almost like the room was calling out to her.

She brought these concerns up to sister Maria, the head of the orphanage, only to receive a glare and a thorough telling off of how 'it wasn't lady-like to be so curious'. She had hung her head in shame and swiftly apologised for her wrongdoings, but she had not missed the curious way that sister Maria had reacted to the question; how her back straightened upon mention of the room, how the grip on her morning coffee became more strained, and, most curious of all, the way she had glanced worriedly in the direction of the room when she thought Katherine wasn't looking. Though, after the scolding that Katherine had received, she decided it best not to bring up anything more about the room. And so, a week later, Katherine found herself losing interest in the room. A month later, she had completely forgotten that the conversation had ever taken place, and a year later, she had nearly forgotten the existence of the room altogether.

It was nearly seventeen years after the conversation and many years after the death of Sister Maria that Katherine had felt a shiver going through her body while passing the room again. The conversation from seventeen years ago sprung to her mind, and Katherine found her curiosity from all those years ago coming with it. Nothing was stopping her from entering the room now. The children had all gone to bed, and there was no sister Maria to stare disapprovingly at her once she was caught. Mind made up, she brought her hand up to the brass doorknob and slowly pushed the door open.

At first glance, there was nothing special about the room. There were the standard desks and chairs that occupied many of the rooms, and the room itself was not very big. Though on closer inspection, Katherine found her gaze captivated by a golden mirror at the back of the room. Unlike the rest of the room, which was ashen and grey, this mirror stood tall and proud and seemed to shine. With a glance behind her, Katherine fully stepped into the room, shutting the door quietly behind her. 

As she walked towards the mirror, she felt another much stronger shudder run down her back, and just as she did before, Katherine felt the all-encompassing fear that had hit her so strongly seventeen years before. Not one to be easily discouraged, Katherine ignored the negative feelings, and when she finally stood in front of the mirror, she raised her hand and lightly touched the intricate, golden edge of the object. At first, nothing happened and Katherine found herself staring at her reflection, though seconds later, she felt an almost impossible pull towards the mirror, and before she could stop herself, she was reaching forward towards the glass with her other hand, coming closer and closer until she was centimetres from touching her reflection. Katherine found herself unable to look away, and the longer she stared, the more mesmerised she became.

Her reflection looked so clear and real that for a moment, Katherine felt as though she were the reflection, and looking back at her was the real her. Unable to stop herself, Katherine reached forward to touch the lifelike reflection, and suddenly, a burst of light escaped the mirror, lighting up the whole room and encompassing her hand and her whole body. 

Pain unlike anything she had ever felt before shot through her body, a thousand times worse than anything she could have ever imagined. She felt as though she were being ripped to shreds and all the while, the mirror had not stopped pulling and pulling and pulling until Katherine's whole body had disappeared from the room, and in her place was nothing but golden dust, which seemed to twinkle were the young woman once stood. The light from the mirror slowly dimmed, and the room became ashen and grey once more.
--------------------------------------------------
Elijah knew that something was wrong the moment he had woken up. He couldn't describe exactly what it was, only that he had woken up with the sense that there was something dangerous that was about to happen. This feeling only seemed to get worse whenever he passed the room on the top floor,  which was barricaded off with bright neon yellow tape.

His inner turmoil must have been obvious, for during breakfast that morning in the lunch hall, Sam turned to him with a slightly worried look in his brown eyes, before understanding dawned on him. 

""One of the sisters went missing in that room,"" Sam explained, piling another serving of lumpy mash onto his dinner plate. That was the problem with the orphanage, it didn't matter what quality the food was, as long as the children were fed something. Still, Elijah thought, it was better than living out on the street ""She went in last night and just didn't come back out""

""Well it were her own fault,"" Frederick added, taking a seat opposite Elijah and Sam and glaring at his own plate of cold vegetable stew, before leaning in closer and turning his green eyes onto Elijah, ""Everyone knows that the room on the third floor is locked for good reason""

""Really? why?"" Elijah asked. He'd never heard of anything bad happening in that room. In fact, he'd never even heard of anything bad happening at the orphanage at all, what with the strict rules everyone was forced to adhere to.

""Yeah, the sisters are real secretive about the room, rumour has it that that's where they'd send the bad children. One hour in that room and they came back changed. Never did a bad thing for the rest of their time here,"" Frederick was staring at Elijah with wide, fearful eyes, but the illusion was ruined by the slight smirk that pulled at his thin lips. When Elijah rolled his eyes and shoved the other boy, Frederick broke out into raucous laughter.

""oh Fred, you can be a real idiot sometimes,"" Elijah admonished, ""Aren't you at all curious? I mean it's impossible for someone to just disappear like that, especially in a place like this""

""She didn't disappear, I'll tell ya exactly what happened. Sister Katherine got bored of the strict rules and the constant need for order here and decided that she'd much rather live somewhere far away from this place,"" Frederick shot back. Gone was his previous mirth, replaced, instead, by the dead eyes and monotone voice that often took over when describing a place such as Fulham.

Fulham's House for Lost Boys was an orphanage that took in abandoned children, who were looked after by the Nun's of the nearby church. While it was widely thought that the church cared for the boys out of the goodness of their own heart, the truth was that the boys that lived here were cheap, easy labour. From the minute the sun rose till dusk, Fulham boys were put to work. Whether it be cleaning, cooking, organising papers, or even helping out at the church, there was never a day where the boys weren't working. The rules here were simple; you get a roof over your head, and food to fill your stomach as long as you did whatever was expected of you.

But no matter how bad the conditions in the orphanage were, it was a thousand times better than being stranded on the cold streets of London, forced to fend for yourself.

A sudden silence descended across the lunch hall as Sister Agatha cleared her throat. She stood proudly at the front of the hall, her hands held behind her back as she called for everyone's attention. Her face was morphed into her signature scowl, so common that she would probably be unrecognisable if she ever smiled,  ""Attention everyone! very good. As you all have probably heard by now, our dear Sister Katherine is no longer with us. Now, I understand this must be a distressing time for you all,"" She announced, glaring at the boys, as if daring them to argue with her.

""But that does not mean that you can become lazy. All chores are to be performed as usual, and are expected to be up to usual standards. A service will be held for Sister Katherine at exactly eight o'clock this evening, which you must all attend. Attendance will be taken, and any students found missing will be severely punished. Now you have,"" here she looked towards her pocket watch, ""Eight minutes to finish your meals and get back to work."" 

She nodded once, signalling the end of her speech, before leaving the hall. As soon as she had disappeared, Elijah turned to Sam, ""No longer with us?"" he asked, confused, ""but I thought that she was just missing? It doesn't make sense, how could they have already pronounced her dead if she had only been gone since last night""

Sam shook his head, his red curls bouncing with the movement, "" it doesn't matter Eli, and it'll do you no good thinking about it. I know what's about to happen, and I'm telling you right now, do not, under any circumstances, try to hold your own investigation, do you hear me? You are not to enter that room no matter what"".

""I hear you,"" Elijah replied bitterly, ""But aren't you curious? The sisters have to be hiding something""

Sam was shaking his head before Elijah had even finished speaking, ""No I am not, and if you know what's good for you, you'll forget all about the room""

Elijah nodded once more, and that was the last they spoke about the room that day.

But it seemed no matter how hard he tried, he could not forget about the room. That night, after the service, Elijah lay awake in his too small bed and tried to make sense of everything. Sister Katherine was one of the good Sisters, always allowing children to sleep in when it was her turn to do the morning runs. Always allowing boys to take a break in her office if they got too tired. So it didn't make any sense for her to suddenly leave the boys alone when she seemed to care for them so much.

What was even more confusing was how she was being pronounced dead before there had even been a proper search for her. There was no body during the service, which meant that she had still not been found. She had only been missing since the night before, surely they had to wait a few days before pronouncing her dead? And what was so special about the room. If sister Katherine had simply run away, there would be no need to block off the room for so long.
There were so many questions and no answers and Elijah felt he would go mad if he didn't at least try to find some sort of explanation. Surely, it wouldn't be too bad if he snuck into the room for a few seconds, just to reassure his mind that nothing strange was actually going on. 

Yes, that seemed like a good idea. He'd sneak into the room, do his own little search, and when nothing came up, he could go with the story that Sister Katherine had indeed passed away. Mind made up, Elijah tried his best to be as quite as possible as he slipped out of bed, so as not to  disturb his roommates. Shutting the door as quietly as he could, he made his way to the room, trying his best to avoid the creaky floorboards and thin walls.

Upon entering the room, Elijah's eyes were immediately drawn towards the mirror. It was very extravagant, probably the most luxurious mirror Elijah had ever seen. The closer he got, the more he seemed to notice the intricate detailing around the mirror. It had a golden border that seemed to shine in the bright room. Elijah was so captivated by the mirror that he had completely forgotten why he'd come here in the first place.

When he saw his reflection, Elijah's breath caught in his throat. His reflection looked almost ethereal, unreal. His blonde hair seemed to glow, his usually pasty skin seemed shiny, a healthy pink dusting his cheeks. Slowly, Elijah lifted his hand towards his reflection. When his hand made contact with the glass, he felt a pleasant warmth shoot up his arm. That was odd. Elijah pulled his hand back and placed it on his reflection once more. Again, he felt that warmness jolt through his arm.

It was a pleasant feeling, that left a slight tingling in his arm. He lifted his hand off the glass and reached forward to touch it once more. His fingers lightly grazed the glass, and he leaned in closer, he wanted to put his whole body against the mirror. Wanted to feel that warmth all over him. He took a step closer to the mirror. He wanted to wrap his arms around it, keep it close.

""Elijah!"" A voice whispered harshly, and Elijah was pulled out of his daze, turning towards the door to find Sam staring at him in horror. His red hair was wild and his eyes were red rimmed, a clear sign that he had just woken up, ""Elijah what are you doing?!""

""I-""

""It doesn't matter, step away from the mirror and come back to bed! If one of the Sisters see us then that's it, we'll be beaten within an inch of our lives! Come on!"" Sam sounded frantic now, and Elijah understood why. The Sisters were definitely not shy when it came to handing out punishments
.
""I- yes you're right,"" he replied, slightly ashamed, and took a step forward. Except, he very quickly found, he could not. The hand that had been touching the mirror was stuck, and it did not matter how much he pulled, it would not budge.

""I don't think I can Sam"" He whispered, his voice slightly shaking. What was wrong? Why couldn't he move arm?

""What do you mean you can't?!"" Sam shouted back.

""I mean my arms stuck!"" He answered as calmly as he could. All he had to do was stay calm. Control his breathing. Yes, everything was fine. Surely there was a way to get his arm out.

""Oh Jesus! I told you not to snoop Elijah! Try pulling!"" Sam cried, completely unhelpfully 

""Oh thank you Samuel, I hadn't thought to try that!"" 

""Well try harder! Hurry!"" He cried once more, and Elijah turned back to see the lights downstairs  turn on. Oh no, they'd woken up Sister Agatha.

Elijah turned back to the mirror,  shut his eyes and with a deep breath pulled his arm with all his might, and for a jolt, he thought that he had done it. He could feel a slight breeze against that arm that was stuck in the mirror, and for one second he thought he was free. But his short lived triumph was slowly replaced by fear as he watched his arm get completely sucked through he mirror.

""Oh my God!"" He cried, and the fear that he had been feeling turned into full blown panic and horror when he found that the mirror was still pulling. In seconds, Elijah's leg and shoulder were being pulled into the mirror.

""Elijah!"" Sam cried once more, running to his friend and grabbing onto his arm, pulling as hard as he could. It was a futile attempt for the minute Sam's hand grabbed onto Elijah, both boys were pulled into the mirror and in their place lay a pile of golden dust, which twinkled in the dark room.
------------------------------------
Sister Agatha awoke to the sound of harsh screams coming out of the room upstairs. It took a few seconds for her to realise why that was strange, but when she remembered the mirror and the dangers of the room, she jumped out of bed and ran up the stairs.

When she entered the room, she was greeted with the sight of pile of shimmering gold dust which lay just in front of the mirror. That cursed mirror. When sister Maria had passed, Agatha was given the job of leader of the orphanage. Upon reading a letter addressed to the next head, written by Sister Maria.

That cursed mirror. When sister Maria had passed, Agatha was given the job of leader of the orphanage. There were two things that were passed down to here. The first was her golden pocket watch, an heirloom that was passed down from leader to leader of the orphanage. The second was a letter addressed to the next head, written by Sister Maria, explaining why the room on the top floor should be watched carefully. 

Her first course of action as head was to get rid of the damned mirror, but she had been advised by many of the elders at the church that the mirror had been here for too long, that there was too much history behind the mirror that they could not simply just give it away. And now, as she stared down at the ashes of the children who had been taken by the mirror, she couldn't help but think about how wrong she was to have listened to the elders. First sister Katherine, and now two of her own boys from Fulham's, how many more would the mirror take? Was it really so important that they would be willing to risk so many lives?


A sharp burning sensation in her pocket pulled her out of her turmoil, and Agatha reached in and slowly pulled out the - Pocket watch? She didn't even remember placing it in her pocket when she'd woken up. She lifted the golden watch closer to inspect it, and to her utter confusion, she saw that it had stopped at precisely three o'clock.


Shaking her head, she closed the watch and placed it back into her pocket. She'd have to get it checked tomorrow. For now, she'd have to clean up the mess in this room and find some way to explain the disappearance of two of her boys.

I posted a thread last week about the mayor candidates and it got some good discussion going, so I thought I’d do the same for this issue. 

Dayton can use some stable healthcare options with all the past closures and threats of future closures. Plus, I thought the proponent’s argument about how successful the public hospital in Cleveland is was much more convincing than the opponent fearmongering saying that the hospital will provide free care to everyone. I thought that was a strange claim and checked it myself — no where in the full text of the issue does it say that. So that seems like a lie (he is a politician lol)

Felt like the opponent piece was using scare tactics about shutting down the fire station and providing free healthcare instead of actually trying to be convincing. If Cleveland can do it then I don’t see why Dayton can’t. If only 5% of revenue comes from taxpayers like Cleveland, then $20 million will go a long way. Especially when there’s been hospitals built for less than that recently, like the St Clairsville neighborhood hospital which just opened up. 

I like the vision of the residents who came together to put this on the ballot and am disappointed that the opponent is a politician talking about how it’s not possible. Don’t know who that guy is but politicians are usually hopeful and he seems pretty negative and appealing to emotion. If it only costs me like a cup of coffee a month then I don’t think that’s too high a price to pay for a chance at something great that helps many thousands of people in the city. 

I’ll be voting yes on Issue 9. How about you?",6,1760638699.0,dayton,19,0.69,False
