1lgmi5y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgmi5y,[homemade]  Canelés Used to eat these as a kid!,"These canelés have a special place in my heart. I used to eat them as a kid, totally mesmerized by how they were crunchy on the outside and somehow jiggly custardy inside. I didn’t even know what they were called.

Many years later, I saw them in a coffee shop, and honestly, my eyes welled up! I had to ask her the name so I could finally make them myself. Many tries (and a few disasters) later, baking them has become a weekly ritual. Always worth it making em bad boys! 

I mean! just look how custardy that is!! This batter rested for 48 hours to develop flavor, and the sugar crystals fully melted in by then. You start baking them at 500°F for the first 15 minutes so they build that deep, caramelized crust, which traps steam inside and gives you that insane contrast crunchy shell, custard juggiley wiggiley heart.

I don’t know, that’s just how I see it! but it blows my mind every time.

This batch is vanilla bean with a strawberry rhubarb crémeux and a little berry on top for fun. You do not have to make the crémeux at all ! They are great by itself! I was just experimenting 🙃! Feedback or flavor ideas always welcome!",2,1750475178.0,food,0,1.0,False

Title says most of it.

Im currently using the OG Breville Oracle with the specilita.

Im wanting to get some additional quality ouy of my latte's. If i sold Specialita and spent $1000 would there be a noticeable difference in cup quality?

Currently make also exclusively a short latte or a sorta cortado..ish drink.

I currently dont single dose, although im thinking this might be the next step. I currently have a hopper with 2ish days worth of coffee in it.

I dont mind spending the 1000, but if its only going to minimal quality I'm not super keen.",1,1750475036.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1lgmccb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1lgmccb/eye_twitchingspasm_for_a_few_weeks_now/,eye twitching/spasm for a few weeks now,"23F. for the last week or so (maybe 2 weeks, I forgot when it first started) my right eye was twitching a lot on the bottom part of it. obviously, this could be a few things but I’m not sure. I have an explanation below of what I am experiencing. 

I have been drinking more caffeine than usual for the last few weeks but nothing crazy. about a shot of espresso per day if I make it at home but occasionally I have been getting it from a coffee shop but always a latte and the smallest size. I am sensitive to caffeine in that I cannot have too much of it at once but normally drinking one latte a day is normal/fine for me. I’m thinking I possibly overdid it on the caffeine? so I am trying to cut it out now. I have also been having some headaches that feel like they start on the left side of the brain then they move all over. 

I stare at screens all day, at work and at home. not sure if my eye is overreacting to strain or what. I also need to set an eye exam because I’m due for one and need an updated prescription. maybe that could be it as well?

so 2 days ago, I got some moisturizing eye drops to see if it was possible my eye was dry. this did stop the twitching, but then today (I didn’t take any eye drops yesterday or today) the upper part of the same eyelid is now twitching!

I guess my question is, at what point should I go see a doctor? I feel like the headaches are concerning but I don’t know. I do have anxiety and do get stressed but nothing worse than my normal baseline. I also take a women’s daily health vitamin so I’m not sure if it is related to a deficiency. I also stay very hydrated (my pee is almost always clear).

should I give it a few more days of no caffeine and see if it still persists? anything else I should try? I’ve tried warm compresses too and they feel good but don’t stop it. thank you in advance. ",1,1750474669.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False
1lgmbth,https://www.reddit.com/r/GamerPals/comments/1lgmbth/35_est_looking_for_a_partner_in_crime_and_fellow/,35 | EST | Looking for a partner in crime and fellow developer,"Hello everyone !

I'm a 35 years old French guy who settled in DC recently. After 15+ years of gaming with my best pal, life decided to end this amazing collaboration : he’s now playing the more serious game of spawning a new kid (I'm the godfather :D  but I'm banned from suggesting names).

So I'm looking for a new gamerpal to play mainly RPG and Sims games on EST times. I'm kind of old school so I would love some LAN enjoyers in Virginia if that still exists. I also have a VR headset and a good setup so I'm trying a bunch of games using UEVR and VorpX if that can interest someone.

But I'm also playing quite a lot of other games. On top of my mind, here is a list of games I have been heavily playing lately :

\- RimWold (MP mod)

\- No Man Sky VR

\- Palworld

\- 7 days to die

\- Star Citizen (but you have to pilot as I never figured out my joysticks binding)

\- Cyberpunk VR with the REAL mod

\- Dead Island 2

\- Civ 4,5,6 (I have 7 but never played it yet)

\- Fo4 and Fallout 76

\- Warhammer games (Vermintide 1/2 and Darktide)

I'm very open to any other game genre however not into COD or Fortnite specifically. I'm also open to just chat and chill and play solo using Parsec.

I'm also in the process to build a serious game for my company but would love to start a passion project with another SWE or artist (I insist on the passion project aspect as I'm just trying to develop my skills, especially regarding non-Euclidian spaces in VR and generative donjons).

About me : I grew up in 7 different countries, a huge tech enthusiast, aerospace engineering enthusiast as well and an aeronautics nerd. I am also an automation engineer in my daily life. I have a huge interest in VR, ethical hacking (I have a OSCP certification but never practice so might be rusty), I code mainly in C++ and HackLang (PHP). Other than that I live 30 in from DC, big fan of going for a beer after work, always ready for an adventure, love nature and NYC (I know both are contradictory but hey I'm a man of paradox).

I know how those online meetup can be weird at first so no pressure, let's get on a casual chat on Discord before playing together if that's your speed. Very happy to meet in a coffee/bar place beforehand in the DC area if you know a nice place as well.

I just wanted to post this message tonight but I'm free tomorrow and Sunday if anyone is available :)",2,1750474624.0,GamerPals,1,1.0,False

1lgm7p0,https://youtu.be/DXRV3pm-jlk,3 Very Scary TRUE Beach Parking Lot Horror Stories,"# ""The Far End of the Lot"":

I’d spent the entire day at the beach, lounging on my faded blue towel, the sand warm and gritty beneath my feet. The waves rolled in with a steady rhythm, and I’d let the sound pull me into a lazy haze, my sunscreen-smeared skin tingling from hours in the sun. My backpack sat beside me, stuffed with a half-empty water bottle, a squished peanut butter sandwich wrapped in foil, and a dog-eared paperback I’d barely cracked open. The parking lot was huge, a sprawling slab of cracked asphalt bordered by tall, swaying dunes that blocked the view of the coastal road. I’d parked my little blue hatchback at the far end, near the sandy path to the shore, figuring it’d save me a few steps to the water. That choice felt fine in the morning, but now, as I trudged back, it seemed like a mistake.The lot was nearly deserted. Only a handful of cars remained, scattered like forgotten toys, and a rusty white van sat a few spaces from mine, its side door slightly ajar. My flip-flops slapped loudly against the pavement, the sound echoing in the quiet. My towel, still damp, hung over my shoulder, dripping cold water down my back. My keys jingled in my hand, and I clutched my phone in the other, its battery at 20%. The air felt heavy, and a knot formed in my stomach, though I couldn’t place why. I scanned the lot, my eyes landing on a man leaning against the van’s hood. He was tall, lanky, his greasy hair tucked under a faded baseball cap. His flannel shirt was stained, sleeves rolled up to reveal bony arms. He held a cigarette, its tip glowing as he took a slow drag, smoke curling upward. His gaze locked onto me, unblinking, and I felt a chill crawl up my spine. I told myself he was just waiting for someone, maybe a friend still at the beach. But his stare didn’t waver.I quickened my pace, the asphalt rough under my sandals. My car was maybe twenty steps away, but it felt like a mile. The man flicked his cigarette to the ground, grinding it under his boot, and called out, “Hey, you got the time?” His voice was rough, like he’d smoked a pack a day for years. I froze, my fingers tightening around my keys until the metal bit into my palm.“Uh, it’s probably around six,” I said, glancing at my wrist even though I wore no watch. My voice sounded thin, unsteady. I took a step toward my car, hoping he’d stay put.He didn’t. He pushed off the van and walked toward me, his boots scuffing the pavement. “You need a ride somewhere?” he asked, his lips twisting into a smirk that showed yellowed teeth. He smelled like stale beer and cigarette smoke, a sour mix that made my stomach turn.“No, I’m good,” I said, forcing the words out. I tried to sound firm, but my heart was hammering so loud I thought he might hear it. I stepped closer to my car, but he moved faster, planting himself between me and the driver’s side door. His shadow fell over me, long and dark, and I noticed a smudge of dirt on his cheek, like he hadn’t washed in days.“You sure?” he said, leaning in closer. His breath was hot, reeking of alcohol. “It’s getting late. Pretty girl like you shouldn’t be out here all alone.” His eyes flicked over me, lingering on my damp swimsuit, my bare legs. I felt exposed, like I was standing there naked.“I said no, thank you,” I snapped, my voice sharper now. I sidestepped, trying to reach the door handle, but he shifted too, his hand resting on my car’s roof, caging me in. My sandals scraped the pavement as I backed up, my backpack slipping off my shoulder and hitting the ground with a soft thud. The lot was dead silent—no voices, no car engines, just the distant hum of waves. The dunes loomed behind us, blocking any chance of someone on the road seeing me.He chuckled, a low, guttural sound that made my skin crawl. “Just trying to be nice,” he said, but his tone was mocking, his smirk wider now. His fingers tapped on my car’s roof, a slow, deliberate rhythm. I glanced at the van, noticing a dented license plate and a cracked side mirror. The open side door revealed a mess inside—empty cans, a rolled-up sleeping bag, a pair of work gloves tossed on the floor. My mind raced with stories I’d read online, about women approached in parking lots, about vans and strangers who weren’t just passing through.“I have to go,” I said, ducking under his arm to grab the door handle. My hands shook as I yanked it open, the hinges squeaking loudly. I slid into the driver’s seat, slamming the door so fast it caught the edge of my towel. I hit the lock button, the click echoing in the car. My heart was a drum in my chest, each beat loud and fast. Through the window, he tapped on the glass, his knuckles leaving greasy smudges. “Come on, don’t be like that,” he said, his voice muffled but still too close. His face was inches from the window, his eyes boring into mine.I didn’t look at him. I jammed the key into the ignition, my fingers fumbling so badly I nearly dropped it. The engine sputtered, then roared to life. I threw the car into reverse, tires screeching as I backed out, nearly clipping the van. In my rearview mirror, I saw him saunter back to his van, unhurried, like he had all the time in the world. My chest was tight, my breaths shallow and ragged. I sped toward the lot’s exit, my hands gripping the wheel so hard my knuckles ached.Then I heard it—a low, rumbling engine. I glanced in the mirror. The van’s headlights flicked on, harsh and bright, and it pulled out, following me. My stomach dropped. I turned onto the coastal road, my car rattling over a speed bump. The van stayed behind, keeping pace, its headlights glaring like eyes in the dark. My phone was buried in my backpack on the passenger seat, next to my soggy towel. I reached over, digging through sunscreen tubes, a granola bar wrapper, and a pair of sunglasses until my fingers closed around it. The battery was at 18% now. I swiped to my contacts and called my friend Lisa, my eyes darting between the road and the mirror.“Pick up, pick up,” I whispered, my voice barely audible over the engine. The van was still there, maybe two car lengths back. Lisa answered on the third ring.“Hey, what’s up?” Her voice was light, like she was halfway through a snack.“Lisa, I’m freaking out,” I said, words spilling out in a rush. “There was this guy in the beach parking lot. He was acting so weird, blocking my car, saying creepy stuff. And now his van’s following me.”“What?” Her tone shifted, sharp and urgent. “Where are you right now?”“I’m on the coastal road, heading toward the highway,” I said. My voice cracked as I checked the mirror again. The van was closer now, its rusty grille filling the frame. “He asked if I needed a ride, kept getting in my way. I barely got in my car.”“Oh my gosh,” Lisa said, her voice tight. “I heard something about a creep hanging around that beach. Some guy in a van, bothering people. You need to get somewhere safe, like a gas station or something. I’m staying on the phone with you.”My hands were sweaty, slipping on the wheel. I took a sharp turn onto a side street, hoping to shake him. The van followed, its engine growling louder. My heart felt like it was going to burst through my chest. “Lisa, he’s still behind me,” I said, my voice shaking so bad I could barely get the words out. “What do I do?”“Keep driving,” she said, her voice steady but tense. “Head to the police station. It’s maybe ten minutes from there, near the old pier. I’m looking up the address now. Just stay calm and keep going.”I nodded, even though she couldn’t see me. The street was narrow, lined with shuttered beach houses and overgrown hedges. No one was around—no dog walkers, no joggers, just me and the van. I took another turn, then another, weaving through the maze of quiet roads. My tires squealed as I rounded a corner too fast, the car lurching. The van stayed close, its headlights flooding my car with light. I could almost feel his eyes on me, that same smirk from the parking lot.“Lisa, he’s not stopping,” I said, my voice barely a whisper. “He’s right there.”“Okay, listen,” she said. “There’s a busy intersection up ahead, near the gas station. Get there, blend into traffic. I’m not hanging up until you’re safe.”I spotted the intersection, a cluster of cars and streetlights up ahead. I gunned the engine, merging into the flow of traffic, cutting off a pickup truck that honked angrily. The van was still behind but got stuck behind a slow-moving SUV. I took a sharp left at the light, then a right, my heart pounding as I checked the mirror. The headlights were gone. I held my breath, waiting for them to reappear, but the road behind me stayed dark.“I think I lost him,” I said, my voice trembling. My hands were still shaking, my palms slick against the wheel.“Good,” Lisa said, exhaling. “But don’t stop. Get to the police station. I’m staying on.”I drove straight to the station, my eyes flicking to the mirror every few seconds. When I pulled into the lot, I parked under a bright floodlight, its harsh glow washing over my car. I sat there, engine still running, scanning for that rusty van. It didn’t show up. My hands were shaking so bad I could barely hold the phone. Lisa stayed on until I caught my breath, her voice a lifeline in the quiet.Inside the station, I spilled everything to a tired-looking officer behind a cluttered desk. I described the man’s greasy hair, his stained flannel, the way he’d blocked my door, the van’s dented license plate, the open side door with its pile of junk. My voice wobbled as I recounted how he’d followed me, his headlights like a predator’s eyes. The officer scribbled notes, her pen scratching loudly in the silent room. “We’ve had a few reports like this around that beach,” she said, her face grim. “Sounds like the same guy. We’ll send a patrol to check the lot and keep an eye out for that van.”I drove home, my hands still trembling, checking my mirrors every few seconds. That night, I couldn’t sleep. I kept seeing his smirk, hearing his gravelly voice, smelling that stale beer. I left my bedside lamp on, its soft light pushing back the shadows. The beach used to be my escape, a place to unwind, but now it felt tainted, like his presence had seeped into the sand and waves. I don’t park near the dunes anymore. I leave long before the lot empties, my keys always in hand, my phone fully charged. I walk fast, scanning for vans, for men who linger too long. That man’s still out there somewhere, and every time I drive by that beach, I feel his eyes on me, waiting.

  


# ""Rearview"":

I parked my minivan in the Town Center mall parking lot, just a short drive from the Boca Raton beaches where the ocean’s salty breeze always seemed to linger. It was August 2007, and my two-year-old son was strapped in his car seat in the back, clutching a shiny red toy truck I’d bought him at the mall’s toy store. His giggles filled the car, a small comfort after a long day of shopping. The trunk was stuffed with bags—new school clothes for him, a pair of sandals for me, a few groceries. Nothing out of the ordinary. The lot had been packed when I arrived hours ago, cars lined up in every row, but now, as the stores neared closing time, it was eerily quiet. Only a handful of vehicles remained, scattered far apart under the dim glow of the lot’s streetlights. My keys jingled as I unlocked the driver’s door, slid into the seat, and started to buckle my seatbelt, ready to head home to our small apartment.A faint click sounded from the backseat. My heart stuttered. I thought it was my son, maybe dropping his truck or playing with the car seat straps. I glanced in the rearview mirror, expecting his chubby cheeks and bright eyes. Instead, a man’s face stared back at me. He was sitting right behind me, next to my son’s car seat, his pale skin almost glowing in the dim light. A thin, jagged scar ran across his left cheek, puckered and angry, like it had been carved years ago. His eyes were dark, cold, unblinking, and a small black handgun rested in his lap, pointed at me through the gap between the front seats. My breath caught in my throat, and my hands froze on the steering wheel.“Don’t scream,” he said, his voice low and sharp, like a blade cutting through the air. “Start the car and drive.”My hands trembled so badly I could barely turn the key. My son babbled happily, waving his truck, oblivious to the man sitting inches from him. I wanted to turn around, to scoop him up and run, but the gun’s barrel glinted in the mirror, pinning me in place. My mouth went dry, and my voice came out as a whisper. “Please, don’t hurt us. He’s just a baby.”“Shut up,” he snapped, leaning closer. I could smell him now—cigarettes and something sour, like old sweat. “Drive to the ATM across the street. Do it now, or I start with the kid.”My stomach lurched. I fumbled with the gearshift, my fingers clumsy, and pulled out of the parking space. The lot stretched out around us, vast and nearly empty. The streetlights cast long, flickering shadows that seemed to shift as I drove, like they were alive, watching. A few cars were parked far off, their windows dark, no one inside. I scanned the lot desperately for a security guard, a late-night shopper, anyone who might notice something was wrong. But the mall’s glass doors were dark, the storefronts shuttered. It was just us, trapped in this concrete desert.“Why are you doing this?” I asked, my voice shaking as I turned onto the main road. I kept my eyes on the mirror, watching his face, watching the gun.“Don’t talk,” he said, his tone flat but heavy with threat. “You ask questions, you make this worse. Just drive.”I gripped the wheel tighter, my knuckles white. My son started singing to himself, a garbled little tune about his truck, and each note felt like a knife in my chest. I wanted to tell him it was okay, to comfort him, but I was afraid to speak, afraid to move wrong. The ATM was just across the street, a standalone machine in a gas station lot, its blue glow cutting through the darkness. I pulled up and stopped, my heart pounding so hard I thought it would burst.“Get out,” he said, nudging the gun against the back of my seat. “Take out five hundred dollars. All of it. And don’t try anything stupid.”I nodded, my hands shaking as I grabbed my purse from the passenger seat. My debit card was buried in my wallet, and I fumbled to find it, my fingers slipping. The machine’s screen lit up my face as I punched in my PIN, every beep sounding too loud, like it was announcing us to the world. I kept glancing around, praying for someone to pull into the lot, for a cashier to step outside the gas station. A police car cruised by on the main road, its red and blue lights flashing, and for a moment, hope surged in my chest. I thought about waving, screaming, anything to get their attention. But the man’s voice cut through my thoughts.“Don’t even think about it,” he said, his eyes locked on mine in the mirror. “You signal them, and your kid pays for it.”My hope crumbled. The police car disappeared around a corner, and I was alone again. I withdrew the cash, the machine spitting out bills that felt dirty in my hands. I climbed back into the car and handed them over, my fingers brushing his. His skin was cold, clammy, like touching something dead. He counted the money slowly, deliberately, then stuffed it into his jacket pocket.“Drive back to the mall,” he said, the gun still steady. “Park in the far corner, by the dumpsters.”I did as he said, my mind racing for a way out. The mall lot was even darker now, the lights flickering like they were about to die. The corner he chose was the worst part—hidden from the main road, far from the mall’s entrance, where the dumpsters sat in a shadowy cluster. No one would see us here. No one would hear us. My throat tightened as I remembered the news stories, whispers of women who vanished from this same mall. A young woman last spring, found dead miles away. Another mother and her daughter, just months later, tied up and gone. Was this him? The one the police were hunting? The thought made my skin crawl.“Stop here,” he said as we reached the corner. He pulled something from his pocket—zip ties, the kind you can’t break. “Hands behind your back.”“Please,” I begged, tears streaming down my face. “We did what you wanted. Just let us go.”“Quiet,” he said, his voice like ice. He reached over the seat, yanking my wrists together. The plastic ties dug into my skin, sharp and tight, cutting off circulation. My son started to whimper, his truck forgotten on the seat. “Mama?” he said, his voice small and scared.“It’s okay, baby,” I said, my voice breaking. “Mama’s here. We’re okay.” But I wasn’t sure I believed it. The man tied my hands so tightly I could feel my pulse throbbing against the plastic. He leaned back, his scar catching the faint light from a distant streetlamp, making it look like it was moving, alive.“Now listen,” he said, his face so close I could see the stubble on his jaw, the faint twitch in his lip. “You’re going to stay quiet. You tell anyone about this—cops, your husband, anyone—and I’ll know. I’ll be watching. I’ll find you. And I’ll find him.” He nodded toward my son, and my heart stopped. I pictured his tiny body, his trusting eyes, and a sob caught in my throat.He opened the back door and stepped out, his boots crunching on the loose gravel. For a moment, I thought he might turn back, might decide we weren’t worth letting go. But he just stood there, staring at me through the window, his eyes boring into mine. Then he turned and walked away, his figure blending into the shadows until he was gone, like he’d never been there at all.I sat frozen, my wrists burning, my son crying softly beside me. The parking lot was silent, but every sound—a creaking dumpster lid, a distant car engine—made my heart race. Was he really gone? Or was he hiding, watching, waiting for me to move? I imagined him behind every car, in every shadow, his scarred face lurking just out of sight. My breaths came in shallow gasps, and I fought the urge to scream.I twisted my hands, the zip ties cutting deeper with every move. My fingers went numb, but I kept pulling, desperate to get free. After what felt like hours, one tie loosened just enough for me to slip a hand out. My wrists were raw, bleeding, but I didn’t care. I reached back and unbuckled my son, pulling him into my lap. His little arms wrapped around me, his face buried in my chest, and I held him so tight I thought I’d never let go.I fumbled for my phone in my purse, my hands shaking so badly I dropped it twice. When I finally dialed 911, my voice was barely a whisper. “Help us,” I said. “Please, someone was in our car. He had a gun. We’re in the Town Center mall parking lot.”The police arrived, their flashing lights cutting through the darkness. They searched the lot, their flashlights sweeping over the dumpsters, the empty cars, the shadows. But he was gone. They asked me to describe him—pale, dark hair, that scar like a cruel signature across his face. I told them everything, even though he’d warned me to lie, to say he was someone else entirely. The officers exchanged looks, and one mentioned other cases, women who didn’t make it home from this same lot. “You’re lucky,” he said. The word felt like a slap. Lucky? I didn’t feel lucky. I felt like I’d stared into the eyes of death and barely escaped.Weeks later, I couldn’t stop seeing his face. I read about the others—Randi, a young woman taken from this lot in March, found dead in a ditch. Nancy and her little girl, Joey, bound and shot just months after my night. The police thought it was the same man, but they had no name, no face, just sketches that didn’t quite match. They never caught him. Every time I drove past a parking lot, I checked my mirrors, my heart racing. I locked my doors twice, three times, even in broad daylight. I saw him in every stranger’s glance, every flicker of shadow. My son forgot that night, his toy truck still on the floor of the car, but I never will. I still hear his voice, low and cold: I’ll be watching. And I wonder if he is.

  


# ""After the Storm"":

I pulled my rental car into the beach parking lot at Magen’s Bay, St. Thomas, the tires grinding against the loose gravel and sand. The lot was nearly deserted, a stark contrast to the usual crowds this beach drew. Hurricane Maria had torn through the U.S. Virgin Islands just days ago, leaving behind a mess of broken palm trees, scattered debris, and a heavy silence that pressed against my chest. I was here for my friend Hannah, who had vanished without a trace. Her car was found in this lot, and I couldn’t just sit at home waiting for news. I had to find her.Stepping out of the car, my sneakers sank into the sandy gravel, and a faint breeze carried the sharp scent of salt and seaweed. Hannah’s sedan sat alone, its silver paint dulled by a layer of dust and salt spray. The driver’s door was slightly ajar, as if someone had left in a hurry. I approached it cautiously, my heart thumping. Inside, her purse slumped on the passenger seat, its strap tangled around a water bottle. Her phone was still plugged into the charger, the screen dark but showing a faint crack across the corner. A half-eaten granola bar lay in the center console, wrapper crinkled. Why would she leave all this behind?“Hannah?” I called, my voice thin against the steady crash of waves from the beach beyond. No answer came, just the distant cry of a seagull and the rustle of palm fronds in the breeze. The lot felt too empty, too quiet, like it was holding its breath. I scanned the area, noting a few abandoned cars at the far end, their windows fogged with condensation. A single streetlamp flickered, casting weak shadows that seemed to shift when I wasn’t looking.I decided to search the beach. The path down was narrow, overgrown with weeds and littered with storm debris—splintered wood, clumps of seaweed, a child’s sandal half-buried in the sand. The water looked murky, churning with bits of plastic and branches, as if the hurricane had stirred up the ocean’s secrets. I walked along the shoreline, my shoes sinking into the wet sand, calling Hannah’s name every few steps. “Hannah! Are you here?” My voice echoed, unanswered, and the vastness of the beach made me feel small, exposed.Then, about fifty yards down, I spotted something caught in a pile of driftwood. My pulse quickened as I jogged toward it, kicking up sand. It was a piece of fabric, partially buried. I knelt, my fingers brushing away the gritty sand to reveal a woman’s shirt, pale blue, torn at the sleeve and stained with something dark—maybe mud, maybe something worse. My breath caught. It was Hannah’s shirt; I recognized the small embroidered flower near the collar, something she’d pointed out proudly when she bought it. Beside it, half-covered by sand, was her wallet. I dug it out, my hands trembling, and opened it to find her driver’s license, her face smiling back at me, frozen in time.“Hannah!” I shouted, spinning around, my eyes darting across the empty beach. The bushes lining the path rustled, and I froze, my heart pounding so hard I could feel it in my throat. “Who’s there?” I called, but the only response was the waves. I clutched the shirt and wallet, my mind racing. Had she been hurt? Taken? I couldn’t just stand here.I hurried back to the parking lot, my footsteps loud in the quiet. As I neared Hannah’s car, I saw a man standing beside it, his silhouette tall and imposing. He wore a faded security uniform, the kind you’d see at a resort, with a badge pinned crookedly to his chest. His face was shadowed, but his eyes caught the dim light, watching me closely.“Excuse me,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady despite the shake in my hands. “Do you know anything about this car? Or the woman who owns it?”He turned slowly, his boots scuffing the gravel. “I’m just checking the lot,” he said, his voice low, almost a growl. “There’s been looting since the hurricane. Dangerous to be out here alone.”“I’m looking for my friend,” I said, holding up the wallet. “Her name’s Hannah. This is her car, and I found her shirt and wallet on the beach.”His jaw tightened, and for a moment, his eyes flicked to the wallet, then back to me. “Hannah? Yeah, I heard about her. She was at the shelter up the road, volunteering. Haven’t seen her since the storm hit.”“Do you know where she might’ve gone?” I asked, my voice cracking.He shrugged, his expression unreadable. “Hard to say. The storm messed everything up. But I heard a report of a woman screaming near here during the hurricane. Couldn’t get to her with the winds. By the time anyone checked, no one was there.”A scream? My stomach lurched. “Was it her? Did anyone see anything?”He shook his head. “No one knows. Look, you shouldn’t stay here. People are desperate now, doing things they wouldn’t normally.”His words sent a chill through me, colder than the evening air. “I have to find her,” I said, my voice firm despite the fear clawing at me.He studied me for a long moment, then sighed. “I can take you to the shelter. Someone there might know more. I’ve got a golf cart for patrols.”I hesitated, glancing at his uniform, the badge glinting faintly. He seemed legitimate, but something about his stillness made me uneasy. Still, I needed answers. “Okay,” I said. “Let’s go.”We climbed into his golf cart, the seats creaking under our weight. As we drove along the coastal road, the headlights cut through the growing darkness, revealing cracked pavement and fallen branches. He spoke, his voice barely audible over the hum of the engine. “The hurricane was chaos. Winds over a hundred miles an hour, no power, no phones. People were stealing, fighting. Some just disappeared.”I gripped the edge of the seat, the wallet and shirt in my lap. “Did you see Hannah at all? Before she went missing?”He kept his eyes on the road. “Saw her once, at the shelter. She was handing out water bottles, talking to everyone. Seemed like she cared. But then the storm hit, and things got crazy.”We reached the shelter, a concrete community center packed with people. Cots lined the walls, covered with blankets and sleeping bags. The air smelled of sweat and instant coffee. Families huddled together, some whispering, others staring blankly. I found the woman in charge, Maria, standing near a table stacked with canned food.I showed her Hannah’s wallet. “Do you know her? She was volunteering here.”Maria’s face lit up with recognition, then clouded with worry. “Yes, Hannah! She was helping with food and blankets. Such a kind soul. But she left during the storm, said she needed to check her car—thought the windows were down. She never came back.”“Did anyone look for her?” I asked, my voice tight.Maria’s shoulders sagged. “The storm was too strong. Winds were tearing roofs off. We couldn’t go outside. When it passed, we searched the beach, the lot, everywhere. Nothing.”I swallowed hard, the shirt’s stains flashing in my mind. “I found her things on the beach. Her shirt was torn.”Maria gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. “Oh, no. That’s awful. We need to tell the police again, but they’re so busy with the recovery.”“I’m going back to the lot,” I said. “I might’ve missed something.”Maria grabbed my arm, her grip firm. “Please, be careful. There are bad people out there, taking advantage of the chaos.”I nodded, but my mind was already racing. Back at the parking lot, the sky had darkened to a deep indigo, the streetlamp now casting a sickly yellow glow. The lot felt like a trap, the shadows too deep, the silence too heavy. I searched Hannah’s car again, my flashlight beam bouncing off the dashboard. In the glove compartment, I found a folded map of the island, a red pen marking a route from the shelter to the beach, then to a spot deep in the hills. My hands shook as I traced the line. Why would she go there?I got into my car and followed the map, the road narrowing as it climbed into the jungle. Vines scraped the car’s sides, and the air grew thick with the smell of wet earth and rotting leaves. My headlights barely pierced the darkness, catching glints of animal eyes in the underbrush. After twenty minutes, I reached a crumbling house, its wooden walls sagging, windows boarded with splintered planks. The front door hung open, swaying slightly.I stepped out, my flashlight trembling in my hand. “Hannah?” I called, my voice barely above a whisper. The house loomed, its shadows swallowing the light. I pushed the door open, and it groaned, revealing a dusty interior. Furniture sat under moldy sheets, and cobwebs draped the corners like curtains. The air was stale, heavy with the scent of decay.A creak came from upstairs, slow and deliberate, like footsteps. My heart pounded, my mouth dry. “Hannah? Is that you?” I called louder, my voice echoing off the walls.No answer, but the footsteps moved again, heavier now, heading toward the stairs. I backed up, my flashlight beam darting across the room, catching glints of broken glass on the floor. Then, a faint voice, barely audible: “Help… me…”It was Hannah. I bolted up the stairs, my shoes thudding on the creaking wood. At the top, in a small room lit only by my flashlight, I found her—sprawled on the floor, wrists bound with rough rope, a dirty cloth gag hanging loose around her neck. Her face was pale, her eyes wide with fear, her clothes torn and streaked with dirt.I dropped to my knees, fumbling with the ropes. “Hannah, I’m here,” I said, my voice shaking. “You’re okay now.”She coughed, her voice hoarse. “He… he tricked me. Said his wife was hurt. I followed him here, but he tied me up, left me.”“Who?” I asked, freeing her hands. “Who did this?”“A man,” she whispered, her eyes darting to the doorway. “Wore a mask. He’s been watching me, I think. Since the shelter.”“We’re leaving,” I said, helping her stand. Her legs wobbled, and I supported her as we stumbled down the stairs, the house creaking around us like it was alive. Outside, I got her into my car, my eyes scanning the darkness. The jungle felt too close, the shadows too alive.As I started the engine, headlights flared behind us, bright and sudden. A car was parked at the edge of the clearing, silent until now. My stomach dropped. “Hold on,” I said, slamming the gas pedal.The car roared after us, its engine growling as it closed the gap. Hannah gripped the seat, her breathing ragged. “Is that him?” she whispered.“I don’t know,” I said, my hands tight on the wheel. The road twisted, branches scraping the car. The pursuing headlights grew brighter, the car swerving dangerously close. I caught a glimpse of the driver—a man, his face scarred, eyes gleaming with rage in the rearview mirror.He pulled alongside us, his car inches from mine. “Get down!” I shouted to Hannah as he jerked his wheel, trying to force us off the road. The drop on my left was steep, a black void into the jungle below. I swerved, tires screeching, but he rammed us, metal grinding against metal. The car lurched, skidded, and then we were falling, tumbling down the hillside. Glass shattered, the world spun, and everything went black.Pain woke me, sharp and throbbing in my ribs. I was slumped against the steering wheel, the dashboard lights flickering. Hannah was beside me, unconscious, blood trickling from a cut on her forehead. The car was tilted, wedged against a tree. Above us, flashlights swept the darkness, and voices shouted, “Over here! They’re down there!”Police and paramedics descended, their faces grim as they pried open the door. They lifted Hannah onto a stretcher, her eyes fluttering open as they worked. I stumbled out, my legs weak, the world tilting around me.At the hospital, a detective told me the man was a local criminal, known for targeting women during the hurricane’s chaos. Hannah’s description of his scarred face and the mask led to his arrest. She recovered slowly, her memory of that night fragmented, lost in the fog of fear and trauma.I still see those headlights in my dreams, feel the car lurching over the edge, hear the crunch of gravel under that man’s tires. The beach parking lot haunts me, its emptiness a reminder of how close we came to never coming back. But Hannah’s alive, and that’s the thread I hold onto, even as the terror lingers, sharp and unshakable, in the quiet corners of my mind.",1,1750474250.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

So far of the Colorful drop the Typica is my favorite. I used a v60 and a 5 pour recipe. It was rich in the cardamom / oolong tea notes.

1lglv9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/sciencefiction/comments/1lglv9z/we_value_everything_you_brought_to_the_table/,We Value Everything You Brought to the Table,"*Day 1*

Adam laced up his shoes like it was the first day of the rest of his life. Because, in some ways, it was.

The morning light angled through the blinds just right… soft, blissful. The coffee steamed gently on the windowsill, but there was something better than summer or caffeine in the air today. Today, the world smelled like freedom.

Adam looked in the mirror before leaving his house. ""Never felt clearer,"" he said to his reflection.

He jogged through the neighborhood with fresh legs and a buoyant pace. Two months ago, he would’ve called this route “unproductive.” Now, it was an act of resistance. He was reclaiming himself. They hadn’t fired him, they’d freed him. Let the algorithms handle the spreadsheets and pivot tables. He was going to live.

As he turned the corner, a pink VW Beetle crawled past, windows down, a dusty speaker humming ‘*Strawberry Fields Forever’*. He grinned. Nostalgic choice. Maybe things were starting to loop back to human.

On his way back home, he waved at the neighborhood constant, the old man walking his golden retriever.

*Day 8*

Applied to seven jobs. One thanked him for his “unique perspective.” The others didn’t answer.

Still, one answer out of seven is a pretty good ratio these days. Adam’s optimism cautiously grew, almost as much as his journey in life. He was meditating, journaling, and cooking actual food. He was sleeping better and eating more slowly. For the first time in a long while, he felt like reaching the surface after too long underwater.

*Day 12*

Adam’s muscles hurt this morning, but to keep momentum, he decided to walk. *‘Don’t train the enemy*,*’* read a poster stapled to a telephone pole near the café. Been seeing more of these lately. Probably activist art. Maybe a punk band.

Strawberry fields forever. The same pink VW Beetle passed too. He laughed out loud, alone at his window. ""Leave it to the Beatles to change the mood, right?"" he told the plant on his windowsill. It didn’t reply.

*Day 36*

Adam wandered into the community garden on a whim. There was a woman pulling weeds like they owed her money. Mid-forties, sun-lined, sharp eyes. She nodded at him. He nodded back.

“You’re new,” she said.

“I live down the block.”

“You just noticed this place?”

Adam smiled. “Trying to be more... rooted.”

She looked up, squinting. “Try throwing out the phone too. They make people forget what roots are.”

He crouched beside her. “Maybe gardening is something I should try for a new career.”

She snorted, laughing. “Want to help me plant the kale?”

They gardened in silence for a while. Dirt under fingernails. Real work.

She broke it. “Don’t train the enemy,” she said.

He froze. “Sorry?”

She just shrugged. “Think about it.”

It read: *‘Don’t train the enemy’*

The march passed the community garden. The woman he met earlier was there. Tending to a flowerbed no one else noticed. She didn’t look at him. Just as he moved to say hi, he was met with a sight that had become all too familiar. Something he had come to think of as a neighborhood talisman, the pink VW Beetle.

It rolled slowly behind the crowd. Strawberry Fields Forever drifted faintly above the chants. He smiled and looked proudly at all these people. United in opinion, united in humanity.

*Day 97*

Something burned in him today. He had long given up sending résumés. That energy had turned into thinly veiled frustration and was about to reach ignition.

The march pulsed forward. Adam was in front. Fueled by chants, he felt empowered, invincible. He didn’t notice the pink Beetle behind them.

Someone pushed. He grabbed a heavy signpost, stepped forward, and threw it toward the local shop’s window.

Adam looked in the mirror before leaving his house. ""Never felt clearer,"" he said to his reflection.

He jogged through the neighborhood with fresh legs and a buoyant pace. Two months ago, he would’ve called this route “unproductive.” Now, it was an act of resistance. He was reclaiming himself. They hadn’t fired him, they’d freed him. Let the algorithms handle the spreadsheets and pivot tables. He was going to live.

As he turned the corner, a pink VW Beetle crawled past, windows down, a dusty speaker humming ‘*Strawberry Fields Forever’*. He grinned. Nostalgic choice. Maybe things were starting to loop back to human.

1lgltce,https://i.redd.it/bnq5c95uy68f1.jpeg,Excessive Grease removal from Brew Group using Dishwasher! Who greases the o-rings!? Why?,"I got the Gaggia magenta prestige from whole latte love, and even in Gaggia Milano’s YouTube video on lubricating the magenta it looks like the unit has grease on the brew group. But they don’t ever grease the brew piston o-ring like whole latte love does and shows in their videos. My brew group was excessively greased, and I have been having headaches after coffee with this machine. And I realized all the petroleum grease everywhere is in my coffee.

Also I want to say whole latte love was amazing and I’m very grateful for my machine! Thank you! But also all of the user manuals and official videos from Phillips, Saeco and Gaggia all only say to apply grease to the slides, shaft and group piston. Nothing on the o-rings. Also even Gaggia UK made a video showing grease on all the areas water and coffee contact and I’m like that’s a No Go for me!

I actually ordered the Verdana Coconut Grease to replace the petroleum. And if it spreads at all by chance then it won’t be toxic — literally says it on the bottle.

Do you all grease your o-rings and points of contact with water and coffee? 

This is the official Gaggia Milano video showing no o-rings — but it looks like the group is kind of greasy.
https://youtu.be/M51Q4Mpovcs?si=lZQ8Phorewm_qo7i

Do you all think your brew group should be sticky and greasy all over? Does the grease spread during use?

This is the Gaggia UK video showing grease of everything 
https://youtu.be/R2a8gbuPJGI?si=KSvaNwjHMwYbLSKU

This is Whole Latte Love’s video showing grease of piston, slides, but no piston or shaft.
https://youtu.be/HGmfnGN_JQA?si=zV1hcAIPNt6NEGEC

What do you all think? I feel like the o-ring will lubricate just fine with the coffee residuals. And be a cleaner healthier coffee.

Also my brew group is in the dishwasher, with detergent!!!! I know I know! Anyone else do or done this? Have you ever even tried… not all the time, but if it’s truly gross and covered with grease and I can’t remove it after constant cleaning with rubbing alcohol and then detergent, I just put it the dishwasher. And actually pulled it out half way, and wiped it down really good again to get even more of the grease off.

And then after this I won’t ever need to do this deep clean and removal or grease.",2,1750472962.0,superautomatic,5,0.75,False

What is causing the spikes in my electricity usage kWh both when I am in the house as well as when I am away. I have noticed every morning in the hour from  8am there is a spike in usage. I've put some consecutive days data below.  

nb A = away H = at home

1.74kWh (A); 1.81kWh (A); 1.45kWh (A); 1.24kWh (A); 1.26kWh (H); 2.00kWh (H); 2.35kWh (H)

  
Details

* Solar system (7.48KW; no battery)
* Taylex Treatment plant (I live on an island)
* electric hot water system/fridge
* TV coffee maker turned off but not at the power point
* Starlink - modem and battery
* NO airconditioining 

Im sure there is a simple answer that relates to perhaps how the Taylex works or the settings for the electric hot water heater  but I am interested in people's thoughts.

I've been divorced for 6 years and have dated a little here and there.  But I just haven't  had any luck.  I did have a wonderful match 2 years ago that lasted 6 months and then he decided it was getting too serious so he ended it.  We are still good friends and probably border on more, only because of the strong connection and the way we still flirt super hard.  But it is never going to be more. Never 
That being said, I seem to have a physical type I am attracted to.  But that type, so far, has always turned out to have a very  different set of values,  and likes than I do.  A family member pointed out that I really need to change things up.  So I tried.   I matched with someone (OLD) that was the same age and seemed pretty cool.  His was also pretty cute.   We've been out twice now.  First, I'm pretty sure his most recent picture was at least 10 years old.  I'm not trying to be shallow, but that's a bit deceptive.  All mine are recent.  But I wanted to try anyway because he's funny and nice and seems patient.  The dates have been simple.  Dessert once, coffee once.  He doesn't drink at all.  I am not a heavy drinker but I like one now and then.  He's the logical type, Im more of a creative type.  Our politics and values match perfectly.  He's a great conversationalist as well.  So far it's been a hug good night each time.  I'd be ok with a kiss, but tbh, I'm not sure if there is any attraction.  I'm trying so hard to find it and I keep thinking maybe it just takes time.   We' e been talking for three weeks.  But I also want to feel some passion.  I am set to meet my friend on Sunday afternoon to tell him that I have to back off because I think, it may be causing me to disregard anyone else.  Real truth is that if I'm around HIM for 5 minutes I get butterflies and flushed.  But then I get frustrated because he will flirt like crazy but has zero intention of anything more than friends and I know that.  He's said it verbally and shown me and I've accepted it.  But Why can't I feel that way about this person I went on a date with.  It would be amazing to have that zing for someone who might actually feel it back.

Not with thirst. Not with drama.  
Just this one line that still lives rent-free in my head:

*“I miss being touched without being stripped. Your words felt like home.”*

That’s it. Simple. Honest.  
And it hit deeper than any nude ever could.

I didn’t rush to reply. Not to play games.  
But because something that real deserves attention — not a quick emoji.

The next night, I wrote back.  
And what followed was a slow burn.  
Not sexts. Not kinks. Not roleplay.

Just… real words.  
Late-night chats about loneliness.  
How the sound of rain can bring memories flooding back.  
How sometimes, you miss someone you haven’t even met.

No pressure. No plans. Just presence.

She looked like someone who had been through life — and still carried softness in her.

I had made filter coffee, strong and sweet.  
We sat on the floor, leaning on the wall, sharing silence.  
No Netflix. Just an old Ilaiyaraaja tape playing in the corner.

I nodded.

*“No need to label it tonight. Let it just be this.”*

No touching. No performing.  
Just eyes that saw, ears that listened, hearts that slowed down.

If you’re wondering how to reach me… this is it.  
You don’t need to act bold.  
You don’t have to impress me.  
If something I say touches something in you — say so.

That’s enough.

1lglo1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1lglo1e/do_i_23m_end_things_with_my_fiancé_22m_after/,Do I (23M) end things with my fiancé (22M) after finding out he’s been flirting with his co worker again after previously finding out and discussing the boundary overstep/consequences?,"So around a week before my birthday in April, I noticed that my fiancé was being very secretive with his phone. This was something he’d never done before and from past relationships I somewhat saw red flags about it. As a result I decided to read through his messages, to which initially there was no suspicious messages. The next day, he continued with the secretive behaviour and even quickly swiped off his Instagram DM’s when I walked behind him. I even remarked that he was giggling like a schoolgirl messaging her boyfriend to which he replied very defensively. At this point I was incredibly suspicious and decided to log into his Instagram on my phone and have the occasional look. 

The following day while at work, I saw messages coming from a man who I recognised he worked with, and they were incredibly flirtatious describing sexual acts, to which my fiancé was encouraging and engaging with. I confronted him with this and he was upfront about the ordeal and said this had been an incredibly uncomfortable situation as he felt very forced into a situation with him as he is considerably older. We decided to work at the relationship and trust especially considering I had gone through his messages (which I was not proud of and didn’t want to do again)

Since then we have been constantly up and down, we have since moved house, I have finished my degree and started a new job. To say that we’ve been busy and stressed is an understatement. I had a brief period of working my previous job while also working my new job, meaning straight after moving into our new house I had to work around 16 days without a day off and pulling shifts at both workplaces meaning I’ve barely had time to sleep let alone anything else, I finally had yesterday off which I spent doing mostly housework and errands that I’d put off, today was my relaxing day off. My fiancé calls after finishing work and suggests going for a drink after work and enjoy the nice weather, which I suggest enjoying that at home with some beers to try and save money (we’re going on holiday soon and as I’ve started my new job, this holiday is unpaid) to which he impressed about going out. I did not respond in the greatest way and said it seemed like a waste of money when we could easily do this at home. He came home and seemed very distant. I also began to notice he was hiding his phone again. When he went to the toilet and left his phone I did for the first time since the past incident look through his messages, I found a locked WhatsApp conversation that opened straight away (he has my Face ID on his phone) showing a bunch of messages he’d been sending moments prior to the same co-worker, calling him handsome and baby and that he really wanted to see him tomorrow (while I was at work, and he’d originally told me he was going to a coffee shop on his own for some quiet time to himself). 

When I confronted him about it, there was a lot said, but his reasoning was mainly to say that he felt very isolated, neglected and alone the last couple of months. He also said that he feels that he can talk to this co-worker easier as he is not as reactive as myself, and he gets scared to approach me with certain things. When he told me this, I immediately apologised as I know I can react quite big and have tried to focus on working on this but I had no knowledge that it was this bad. He said he didn’t want to bring it to me as he was too scared, which I understand. He also said that he had no intentions of having a relationship or anything romantic with the co-worker, just finds that he can talk to him about certain things easier. 

While I understand that I have played a massive role in this, and feel incredibly regretful that I’ve made this situation, I am conflicted on where to go from here. When talking about potentially working through this and our future, he was very concerned about keeping his friendship with this co-worker but stated he wanted to do whatever to keep our relationship going. Do I work at things like the last time or do I call time on our relationship?

She just… replied.

Not with thirst. Not with drama.  
Just this one line that still lives rent-free in my head:  
  
*“I miss being touched without being stripped. Your words felt like home.”*

That’s it. Simple. Honest.  
And it hit deeper than any nude ever could.

I didn’t rush to reply. Not to play games.  
But because something that real deserves attention — not a quick emoji.

The next night, I wrote back.  
And what followed was a slow burn.  
Not sexts. Not kinks. Not roleplay.

Just… real words.  
Late-night chats about loneliness.  
How the sound of rain can bring memories flooding back.  
How sometimes, you miss someone you haven’t even met.

No pressure. No plans. Just presence.

1lglj5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1lglj5o/how_to_have_selfcontrol/,How to have self-control?,"Self-control is the invisible force behind success—whether in health, finances, or personal growth. While many believe it’s about sheer willpower, research shows it’s a skill that can be trained like a muscle. Here’s how to strengthen yours, backed by science and real-world examples.

https://preview.redd.it/lmgmbva5w68f1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b25a68bcbec56805a6baeab3b190b08baea5568



1. Understand the ""Why"" Behind Your Goals



Self-control thrives on purpose. When Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps trained, he didn’t just focus on laps; he visualized standing on the podium. A study in Psychological Science found that people who connected tasks to deeper values (e.g., ""I eat healthy to play with my kids longer"") resisted temptation 50% more effectively.



Try this:

\- Write down why your goal matters (e.g., ""I save money to travel debt-free"").

\- Keep this reminder visible (phone wallpaper, sticky notes).



2. Use the ""10-Minute Rule"" to Defuse Impulses



Neuroscience reveals that cravings peak within 5–10 minutes. Author Haruki Murakami uses this principle when writing: if he feels distracted, he waits 10 minutes before acting. Often, the urge passes.



How to apply it:

\- For spending: ""I’ll wait 10 minutes before buying this.""

\- For snacks: ""If I still want cookies after 10 minutes, I’ll have one.""



3. Design Your Environment for Success



Nobel Prize winner Richard Thaler proved that we make better choices when ""nudged"" by our surroundings. For example:

\- Chef Dominique Crenn (3-Michelin stars) keeps junk food out of her kitchen to avoid temptation.

\- A University of Cambridge study found that people ate 73% less candy when it was stored in opaque containers.



Action steps:

\- Remove temptations (e.g., uninstall shopping apps, stock healthy snacks).

\- Add friction to bad habits (e.g., leave your credit card in another room).



4. Practice ""If-Then"" Planning



Psychologist Peter Gollwitzer discovered that people who pre-decide responses to triggers (""If I feel stressed, then I’ll take 3 deep breaths"") are 2–3x more likely to stay on track.



Examples:

\- ""If I get a dessert menu, then I’ll order tea first.""

\- ""If I’m bored at work, then I’ll tackle my top priority task.""



5. Train Self-Control Like a Muscle



A University of Pennsylvania study showed that small, daily acts of discipline (e.g., posture correction, using your non-dominant hand) strengthen overall willpower.



Daily exercises:

\- Delay your morning coffee by 15 minutes.

\- Spend 5 minutes tidying your workspace before leaving.



6. Forgive Slip-Ups and Keep Going



Perfectionism kills self-control. When tennis legend Roger Federer loses a point, he resets instantly—a habit linked to better performance in Journal of Sports Sciences.



Mindset shift:

\- View mistakes as data: ""What triggered this? How can I adjust?""

\- Use the ""fresh start effect"" (new day/week/month) to reboot.



Key Takeaway



Self-control isn’t about deprivation; it’s about strategic self-management. By aligning actions with values, designing supportive environments, and practicing resilience, you can build unstoppable discipline.



Start small today.

My dad can't legally sell anything because he while being the executor doesn't own it. The Texas government wants the taxes to transfer everything upfront. Not one at a time or piece by piece. This affects about a dozen people trying to claim things from him like usually happens. But me and him talked and spent a long time on him buying this bike. And he got the color I liked for me. (I think he knew more than he let on) Anyway he's gone and the bike is tied up in the estate likely to never be resolved and his multiple acres, cars, trucks , 300+guns, a whole 40 foot storage unit full of ammunition, all are looking to be seized. My dad will pay the taxes on the property but anything other than the land and the tiny house he built is subject to repo. I dont want his money land or anything but he specifically left the bike to me. It's a 2000 dollar bike ... I just want to legally own it and register it. Maybe some advice on the other stuff. The fees are ridiculous on everything. He was 95% paid on everything. 450 out of 500k paid. But they want taxes on it. And since he passed and my dad's credit isn't as good it's now valued at 750. And raising. My dads almost 70 and served in Vietnam and did 9 years in the middle east. We don't want to gain. Just keep what uncle worked for. ",1,1750471626.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1lglc8n,https://i.redd.it/2mxtbkscu68f1.jpeg,I have Shahoor Intense and Amore Caffe Now!,"I finally got Shahoor Intense today after waiting almost 2 weeks because it kept going out of stock. I saw it getting some attention recently so I figured why not. For context, I got Amore Caffé last December as a gift and I’ve been completely obsessed with it. I love how it smells exactly like a sweet dark caramel coffee. It sticks to my skin really well and it’s just that perfect kind of sickly sweet I love.

When I saw Shahoor Intense pop up on TikTok for around $30USD, I decided to try it out…and honestly, it’s amazing. I think it smells about 97%(lol) like what it’s inspired by. After wearing it all day, I can say the longevity is definitely there. It lasted about 9 hours on my skin and I could still faintly smell it after my night shower just now.

As for the sillage, I’m not totally sure yet since I haven’t tested it around people much. But overall, I’d give it an 8 out of 10 right now. It’s super close to Amore Café and for the price, it’s absolutely worth it especially if you want to stop your dent of the OG. 

TLDR:
If you love Amore Caffé or sweet syrupy coffee scents, Shahoor Intense is a solid $30 dupe. Great longevity, smells 95% similar, and perfect for saving your more expensive bottles.

This solves a lot of early game industrialization issues, abuse it and rapidly industrialize by trading for goods your construction sector needs. Can also be used to massively overbuild your army as a small country. 

* You can deficit spend and ask GPs/large economies directly to pay off your loans, this helps with rapid industrialization. 

* Treaty ports aren't that expensive, you can do a lot of shenanigans with them too. For example, as the USA you can trade the Ragmuffin states for 2 treaty ports, and then trade those treaty ports directly to Brazil for a free state. All on day one. This sets you up for being able to easily puppet Brazil by usurping their coffee production prestige bonus, I usually go for Sao Paulo. Also, don't try to make the Riograndese survive by taking their border (and subsequently make brazil lose the ragamuffin war and lose a ton of prestige), Brazil lands troops with their navy and eventually wins :( 

* In general, uptrading treaty ports is a great way to trade for states peacefully and with some expense money wise. A lot of small annoying areas that were only able to be gotten through war can now be purchased easily (places like Belize to easily flank Mexico, for instance). 

* Chain together as many prestige goods as you can, particularly resource prestige goods that go into your construction sectors (such as Anglo-Sicilian Sulphur, Sweden's Iron LKAB, or Russia's New Russia LTD) . You can stack throughputs through your whole supply chain and massively overproduce as they are built into new materials. This helps bully people out of the global trade too, you can dominate 90% of the market for a good this way.

* Opium is busted. Direct trade a ton of free opium to someone and laugh as they develop obsessions. Then cut the treaty to implode their country.

* PORTS ARE UNCAPPED NOW. Which means you can build a ton of infrastructure with them, which is good for certain areas in Russia and Japan

* Subventions on export can cause a good that is massively overproduced to undercut everyone on the market and increase your output, allowing the company to invest more in the local economy.

* Allowing countries to build in yours can be useful sometimes as a backwards country, after all, you can nationalize things when you're better off. Sometimes allowing a company with a rare prestige good on a good a monopoly can be good for your economy as well.",4,1750470068.0,victoria3,7,0.83,False

I managed to land a research position and a summer internship (in a CS-adjacent field). I got interviews from first-year FAANG programs but ultimately didn’t get any offers (skill issue, ngl). I didn’t touch LeetCode until last December, so that’s on me. 😭

Honestly, all you need is faith and hope to keep going. But I’ll say this: most of the other interns I met knew someone at the company. Networking really matters, but good communication skills does too. After failing so many big tech interviews, I started wondering if I was doing something wrong (lowkey think I might be autistic, idk). So I joined a mentorship program where (neurospicy) students could practice communication and interview prep, and it helped a ton. At the end of my interview, my manager couldn’t stop complimenting my interviewing skills.

I really think what trips up a lot of CS majors is the networking and communication side. Once you build those, plus the technical skills, you’ll get there. Trust. Religiously visit your College's career center, spam applications on Handshake and LinkedIn, join leadership and mentorship programs, do coffee chats with recruiters (after learning how to talk to humans properly), and keep coding.

1lgkt3d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1lgkt3d/how_i_ruined_my_life_and_found_christ/,How I ruined my life and found Christ,"Just wanted to share my story as I don’t expect many people to have found Christ in this way and to take the weight off my chest.

I was technically born a Christian but spend most of my life as an atheist. Somewhere around 15 I discovered Science and decided there was no point of believing in God. From that point onwards while I was achieving earthly success by doing well in school and then moving abroad for University I was moving deeper into sin. 

Since starting Uni I realised I had major social problems and decided to get out there to learn how to pickup women. This was a long process of me going to clubs and bars and the streets to approach. I got myself in a pickup cult and absorbed all their teachings. Moreover I also got myself into listening to Black Metal (some of you may know their theme) and I looked at Christians with laughter. 

I spend a lot of my time just trying and getting casual hookups and drinking and doing drugs and listening to every word of that cult to get as much sex and women as I could. I did that for about 3 years and then I realised I was craving a relationship. 

One day I was roaming the streets and I saw the cutest girl pass by, I immediately approached her and we hit it right off, within minutes we were sitting having a conversation and then went for a coffee, that day we also had our first kiss and felt magical, however the next day she had to fly home so I got her contacts and we left it there. For the next months we kept on texting until she came back and we started dating. This girl will go on to be the love of my life and my girlfriend and wife for the next 10 years.

She was caring, beautiful, smart, creative and the purest soul out there. She took care of me in sickness, we shared struggles together, we worked hard towards building our life moving from place to place, we raised a cat and had common interests and hobbies.

3 years into our relationship I was at a bad mental place, went to a work party, got drunk and slept with another woman. I felt immense guilt and I told her the next day, she was devastated and we both cried and I felt like I killed a person… however she gave me a second chance and we decided to rebuilt. The next 5 years things improved and we had our things together and we bought a home. 

The last 2 years of our relationship I started having many mental issues, I knew I always had ADHD, Depression and Autism but largely untreated. I tried treating ADHD with pills and things were going well but due to side effects I decided to stop and that slowly put me into even worse mental place. I got very numb over time I felt nothing, I was like a robot and could not show affection to my dear wife. Moreover my soul started filling with hate and negativity I would see everything in a negative light including my relationship and where we lived. This prompted the impulsive behaviour to go travel solo to look for a better living place but really it was also to escape the situation where I felt stuck. All of this eventually led to me going abroad to another country, put myself in the worst possible mental state harden my heart and lose self control to an impulse go into complete dissociation (the devil had entered my soul as I left the door wide open) and visit a prostitute. The moment I left I felt the biggest surge of sorrow I have ever felt in my entire life, all emotions that were bottled up and numbness suddenly came in and I had like a mental reset to base level which made me feel emotions again and I realised what I have done and it all felt unreal like a nightmare but unfortunately it was real…

I spend the next days while still abroad crying and wishing it never happened. All I could see was my wife’s face and immense feeling of guilt, shame and sorrow. I booked a therapist and a ticket home and fasted for 4 days just crying. I had many realisations that the core of my issues was childhood trauma and sexual abuse which led to self destructive behaviours many years down the line, but all too late…

I went back and decided I have to completely change and start going Church for a first time and believe in Jesus Christ. I started taking care of my mental health again and take pills and show all the love and care to my wife as much as possible however… several weeks later received a positive test for an incurable disease. I confessed everything to my poor wife and broke her heart again… I am a monster and was punished for it and I deserved it.

Needless to say at this point the marriage is beyond repair and I will prioritise my wife’s well being and remove myself from her life as she deserves so much better and I was poison to her life… My first and only love gone.

I have nothing, my life was our relationship and love and I ruined it all from poor choices, disbelief and letting the devil enter my soul.

The only thing I have left now is my faith in Christ and I will dedicate my life to believing and serving God and helping spread the word. I will spend my life repenting my sins and asking for forgiveness. I will never find another love again, so I will give my heart to God.

Brothers and Sisters pray for her to find happiness and the best that she deserves.

As for me.. God have mercy on me, a sinner.

Last fun fact of the day: did you know that over the last week, there has been an increase in influencers claiming they should be offered the same level of professionalism in their ‘workplace’ as traditional workers? This isn’t surprising when you consider most of them have never worked a real job in their life, and in reality have no idea what kinds of rights and responsibilities exist in the workplace. But that’s the key term in all of this - rights AND responsibilities. They go hand in hand. 

In traditional workplaces, there’s systems and regulations in place to protect employees from abusive or unprofessional behaviour, and clearly define the expectations of their employer so that the employee is aware of their responsibilities. For example, I can’t call my colleague a talentless fuckwit without HR stepping in. Just like I can’t dress like a common whore and shake my tits in the break room while sticking my tongue out and holding up a peace sign to the camera - trust me, I’ve tried. However, a client or customer can essentially say what they want without being subject to the same rules because they don’t work for or with me. Sure, I can have processes in place to remove them from the premises or ban them from interacting with employees, but HR can’t do shit because these people aren’t employees of the company. 

Influencers who are crying out “we’re at work - would you speak this way to someone in the workplace?!” need to remember two things - firstly, if you want the same rights, you need to also take on the same responsibilities like performance reviews, legal accountability, codes of conduct or dress codes. Secondly, we don’t work with or for you. We’re consumers, and so we’re not subject to the same expectations as employees in your ‘workplace’. 

So the next time an influencer is outraged they’re not being shown the same professional courtesy as a traditional worker, maybe stop the bitching and moaning and get a traditional job with that level of protection. Better yet, keep that sentiment in mind when you’re acting like a twat because some barista didn’t make your coffee fast enough, or your tantrum of “don’t you know who I am?!” was met with silence. They’re at work too. 

Have a great weekend everyone!

 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1750469731.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

So I'm hoping to find someone to chat with and keep company throughout weekend and ideally for the long term!

So I'll start with a bit about myself. I work a Monday to Friday currently from home so I tend to have quite a bit of free time during work. As for physical traits I'm 5'11 tanned skin with dark puffy hair and brown eyes. I am heavier than I would like sorta like chubby teddy bear but I have picked up going to the gym. Ive been going solidly for three months now and have lost a solid chunk of weight and hoping to continue to lose more.

As for things outside of work and the gym. I have various hobbies that i enjoy most of them on the nerdy side of things. 

A big one is playing games I play on PC mostly and I have a switch. My main game is FFXIV currently and I spend most nights either raiding or crafting. I do also farm some mounts from time to time. I also play league moslty TFT but I just have fun running it down on an aram or climbing to gold for my free skin. I have a plethora of multi-player games like Helldivers 2, Stardew Valley, Risk of Rain, and Monster Hunter. I have a lot of other random games and happy to try new ones. I also like pokemon and Mario games as well but don't play those as often anymore. 

I am a huge fan of horror movies and media is often am on the lookout for new hidden gems. Some of my favorites include midsommar, coffee table, where evil lurks, REC and i really could go on. I also enjoy comedy and action films. As for shows I feel like I often go more for documentaries and paranormal type shows. I reallg just like all sorts of spooky stuff and cryptids. Sprinkling in other types of show and anime. I am currently watching a few airing anime like go go loser ranger season 2, kowloon generic romance and witch watch. Always happy to give and take recommendations. 

Another of my hobbies is actually a new thing which is building gunpla and I recently got a airbrush so I am hoping to learn how to paint and just generally learn more about this hobby it's been an exciting start. 

There's definitely more about me to learn and I'm happy to answer questions and just chat. I honestly prefer voice chats a lot more since they flow a lot more naturally than texting if you ask me. Oh right I also have pets a cat and a dog will be happy to share pictures of them. 

So yeah if any of this catches your attention feel free to send a chat or message and lets talk! ",2,1750469700.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lcau74/in_1986_my_family_went_missing_at_a_carnival_i/)

Monoliths pregnant with water and fury flickered upon the distant horizon. They drifted slowly, inevitably, covering the earth in shadow. The fear on the flight was palpable, made worse by the sounds of babies crying and first-time fliers yelping every time the plane shook. 

It was nearly enough to distract me from a distant point by the foothills where what remained of Mister Fulcrum’s Funhouse gathered dust within the mountain shade. 

Nearly. 

The airplane rocked violently again, sending up a fresh wave of screams. The stewardess and her team valiantly tried to calm the passengers down, but I could tell by the rising pitch in their voices that they were worried too. This storm was set to be epic in proportion, one of the most powerful ones in recent decades. 

My eyes drifted as I tried to blink away outlines of light that shimmered around others, but it looked like my perception was permanently fucked. 

When I focused it helped reduce the brightness of their aura but then I could perceive beyond the surface to a person’s very core. In that deep place was a nexus of energy, an interplay of the purest white light and shadow. Some had greater concentrations of one over the other, yet there was not a single person, no matter how good, who didn’t have a bit of shadow. 

There was also not a single person, no matter how bad, who didn’t have a star burning in the center of all that hurt. 

You might be wondering whether I was able to see my own deep-nature, and the answer is no. Even if I could I would not want to. 

You probably think that I am a good man because I have a ‘noble’ cause but the reality is I have done a whole lot of bad in my life, and there are times where I feel like the world would be better off if I wasn’t in it. The only thing I’ve ever been good at is killing. Destroying. That’s weak shit. It’s harder to be patient and build something. 

It made me wonder how these folks would react if somehow, someway, this plane slipped into The Void. Would they deal with it better than I had? Was there something about the nature of the Void that reflected the worst in us? 

The finger twitched in my pocket. I growled and gave it a nice swat. It had been doing that ever since I left Chicago. I sighed, more than a little irritated, and turned back to the window. 

Pressed up against it was the sagging face of a frog-like being with saucer-sized eyes that glowed like lanterns.

My fists clenched as I returned to my mantra where I chanted my parents names over and over in tandem with my breathing. 

The Void had left its mark. These spirits were following me now, and in this world they weren’t incorporeal beings incapable of hurting me.

But that was fine, I could hurt them too. 

I made a finger-gun and fired it between frog-man’s eyes. It grinned, licked the window with a barbed tongue and jumped away, its bulbous body vanishing into the clouds. 

After the plane touched down, I went on the hunt for some coffee. I decided to stick with the crowd this time, and among that chaotic mess of arguing families, annoyed businessmen, and travelers I was able to stop shaking. 

I eventually found a nicely crowded cafe with a view onto the airport tarmac. I ordered a large black coffee along with a crispy breakfast sandwich stuffed with hash browns, eggs, bacon, and cheese. I asked for an extra side of jalapeños and then took a seat near the window. 

The rain was coming down heavy outside. Low visibility, but good for the work I intended to do. I lost myself in the simple conversations taking place around me and finally enjoyed a hot meal. 

I was about halfway through my sandwich when I realized something was wrong. I patted my pocket, then my jacket. “Shit, shit, shit,” I muttered, frantically looking around. 

The finger was gone.

Had I dropped it? Or did someone steal it? 

I was searching by the cafe’s register when I heard someone yell, “snake! A snake!” The cry hung in the air for a moment before the mass of people instantly became a mess of shoving, pointed fingers, and cursing. Then, as people tended to do in an emergency, they started knocking each other over and running every which way. 

Terrified that they would smash what I could only assume was the finger, I sprinted shoulder-first and pushed my way through the commotion, sending people flying left and right. “MOVE!” I roared. 

I spied the finger slithering away as fast as it could towards the bathrooms. I dove for it but the damn thing wiggled underneath the bathroom door. 

“You little shit,” I roared. I kicked the door open and stepped right into a puddle of water. 

The entire bathroom was flooded. Through flickering lights I saw the finger floating by the stalls. It had gone rigid. 

I pressed forward through water levels nearly knee-height. I couldn’t see or hear a source of the flooding — the sinks were off and I didn’t think a toilet could be responsible for all the water. 

I grimaced before leaning over to scoop it up. “More trouble than you’re worth,” I said after giving it a few shakes and zipping it up tight in my pocket. 

I was stumbling back towards the exit when a great mass moved impossibly beneath my feet, as if rising from the ocean depths. It glided smoothly through the water, circling around me first before swimming around the corner. The lights overhead flickered faster, until I was only seeing snapshots of the bathroom. 

I listened and heard something breach the surface, followed by wet plopping sounds. 

*RIBBIT* *RIBBIT* 

Webbed hands wrapped around the corner as a body meant for crushing pressure came into view. Its veined pot belly sagged to its knees, yet the legs and shoulders were heavy with muscle. Big red eyes pointing in different directions suddenly focused on me. 

“What do you have there,” he croaked. A long barbed tongue slid out of his rubbery mouth and tasted the water. His eyes gleamed. “Such power contained within that salt-flesh.” 

I raised my jaw and rolled my shoulders. “You ain’t got the right kind of heart for this fight frog-man.”

He took a step forward. The sheer power of his webbed foot hitting the tile caused the walls to crack. He blew green mucus from his orifices and laughed. “I taste your fear, ape.”

I was afraid. He had trapped me in a kill box and I would not be able to take him down with just my hands and feet. I searched for something, anything that I could use to kill him with, and all the while the water continued to rise. More demons were coming with it. “What is it y’all want? The finger?” 

“Keep the finger. I care not for it. But you, you burned so bright that I could see you from the Chasm. Once I consume you, I will have your spirit forever. That can be a powerful tool, especially when one is already claimed by a god,” he chortled. 

He suddenly leaped towards me, his thick arms outstretched and pink tongue shooting out. 

I dove beneath the waves and kicked towards the exit. I was never the fastest swimmer, but I think the frog was counting on my fear of the water and overshot because of it. Thousands of eyes that glowed like coals watched from the depths, and they were rapidly getting closer. 

I scrambled onto the ledge and narrowly avoided a pink blur that punched a hole into the wall. I threw the door open and ran, the army of frogs’s wet laughter following me out of the airport. 

I got into my work truck and sped out of the lot. I didn’t let my foot even slightly off the pedal until I was well onto the freeway. 

The world was changing and I couldn’t keep up with it. Serpentine creatures with wings soared through the clouds, many-limbed felines hopped from roof to roof, and orbs of light shot across the skies. 

My mind was slipping away from me again and I knew I didn’t have much longer left before I was incapable of seeing things through. I would become a living corpse, frozen by wave after wave of increasing spiritual sight. 

I didn’t care what they did with my body after my mind was gone. All I needed was to see Mister Fulcrum dead, and I would be ready to die. 

When I was closer to home I passed a gas station near a crossroads where my dad used to bring me to get snacks before we went on hikes. A giant stood there now. It was over fifteen-feet in height and covered in blood. Empty eye sockets followed me as I drove past. 

I gripped my steering wheel so tight it nearly broke. There wasn’t a gun I owned big enough to put that fucker down. 

Finally, I yelled. I couldn’t tell you what emotions were in that cry. All I can say is there is only so much a human can take, and even the strongest soldiers can break from the weakest of blows if they have already weathered too many. 

The rain still hadn’t let up when I pulled into the driveway. I stopped on the porch in order to take it all in, knowing in my soul this was the last time I would. I regretted distancing myself so much from the place. 

Outside of some dust, everything was in good condition. Like I mentioned I hardly spent much time here, preferring to stay in wayside motels whenever I was in town. There were just too many ghosts. 

In the living room I saw myself as a kid playing with toys while my parents smiled. I could see the pure joy on my little face, along with the shadow of a worry that they might end up not loving me after all and return me to the orphanage. 

In the kitchen my mom made heart-shaped blueberry pancakes. She kissed me on the top of my head and told me how much she loved me and that nothing would ever change that. 

Out in the back my dad taught me how to ride a dirt bike. I remember falling nearly every time I got on for the first few weeks. My dad would always tell me to get back up and try again. Said that’s how to deal with any problem in life. Always get back up. Always try again. 

My vision blurred as I trudged through the empty home, my footsteps echoing like the memories of their love. I slammed open the door that led into the garage and passed by my dad’s tarp-covered sportster, it had been some time since I last took her out for a spin. 

I gave my gear a good look over, making sure everything was functioning well. The familiar smells of oil and iron grounded me. Once I was satisfied I strapped on my combat vest and double-checked that the witch’s finger was still inside my pocket. 

It was. 

I hated that feeling of relief I felt. 

I set the Visitor’s gift down on my workbench and inspected it beneath the lamplight. It was about a foot long and heavy. There were no inscriptions on it or buttons of any kind. The surface was smooth and gave off a slight vibration. On a whim I held it up to my ear because I was going to give it a shake. Then I heard the sound of waves crashing against the shore. Slow, calm, and powerful. 

The energy of the baton, if that was the right word, was the opposite of the witch’s finger. It just frustrated me that I didn’t know what to do with it. 

I was packing extra rounds when I heard a low moan resound throughout the landscape. A wave of barks rose to meet the giant’s cry and I saw flocks of birds fly away, preferring to brave the storm than to remain. I wiped the grime away from the garage window to better peer through. About a mile out was a solid row of those eyeless giants. They were headed towards the neighborhood, and ahead of them appeared to be more of the frog-men, along with a host of other creatures I could not identify. I considered simply destroying the finger in that moment, but something told me that all of this would only end once Mister Fulcrum was dead. 

I had made my choices and it was time to face the consequences. I didn’t fear that. I welcomed it. A wild grin lit up my face as I revved the sportster. She purred for me, ready for one last ride into a thunderous Hell. 

The earth was drowning, her face hidden from the burning skies. A winding road marked my final destination into an encounter with a being who had served as the focal point of my life ever since he robbed me of the only people who ever loved me. 

Death followed close behind, but I was faster, a blur of lightning and rage, single-minded in my pursuit of one thing and one thing only — the sight of Fulcrum’s face behind the barrel of my gun and the feeling of the trigger against my finger. 

I howled in defiance against nature’s fury and her blinding light, “FULCRUM! FULCRUM! FULCRUM!”

He’s asking $2,500 but I talked him down to $2,200 for a 2001 Dakota with a little over 111,000 miles on it. I got it on Tuesday night and ran like a top for a couple days until this afternoon. I was running a friend to a local coffee shop and I started losing power. My foot put the pedal to the floor and I was right around 3,000-3,500 RPM and I was doing about 30ish mile an hour. Limped it home and my older brother came over with his OBD2 and made me crank the wheel hard to the left then to the right. Nothing too major happened to the left crank, but when I cranked it to the right, the check engine light came on. He pulled up the code and its P1391 - crankshaft position/ camshaft position sensor.

It felt like the best way to build real relationships. 

I got used to spending hours smoking and drinking coffee with strangers, and taking turns telling them my traumas and fears. I worked at a rehab and adopted that way of talking to everyone. Then, my job and ex-sponsor taught me to always act like a therapist, almost like that was the most moral way to interact with anyone.

I realized I really fucking hate it. I never want to be a therapist, and I don't like taking that role with people I know. I also hate sharing my business with strangers, and I don't want to coerce them to share their traumas. Both the therapist and over-sharer roles feel less intimate than being authentic. I would just do it when I was uncomfortable and needed to put on a mask.

Recently, I met some family for the first time, and they were pretty messy and all very deep in XA. I ended up doing that over-sharing coffee routine all weekend. It was exhausting and came with a weird emotional hangover. 

I really prefer doing things like small talk, joking around, and talking about hobbies, fun facts, interests etc. When I need to give someone emotional support, it feels a lot better to just do it naturally and give them my real opinion if they want it. 

Why do XA people act like that and encourage it so much? I feel like it's self-sabotaging and intense, and it makes everyone but XA people very uncomfortable. ",11,1750469043.0,recoverywithoutAA,6,0.93,False

\
WASHINGTON, D.C. (Worthy Satire) - In a bold move to save the American economy a full $0.008 per citizen, the U.S. Mint announced it is moving forward with plans to assassinate the penny -- the coin that costs more to make than it's worth and has spent the last 30 years hiding under couch cushions and gas station floors.\
\
""We've tried everything -- public shaming, rounding laws, even letting Canada shame us -- but the penny just won't die,"" said Mint spokesperson Paula Zinc. ""Now we're pulling the plug. It's over. We're melting Lincoln.""\
\
However, not all elements of the one-cent piece will perish. Officials confirmed that ""In God We Trust"" -- the national motto, spiritual lifeline, and fallback answer on every high school history test -- will be spared and reassigned to other currency like a divine game of musical chairs.\
\
""You can kill the penny,"" said Treasury Secretary spokesman, ""but you can't kill trust in God. That's been grandfathered in since about 1956.""\
\
Critics warned that removing the penny could disrupt the sacred tradition of grumpy men paying in exact change at the DMV, but proponents noted it might also spare countless Americans the embarrassment of scraping the checkout tray for 4¢ in public.\
\
Meanwhile, millions of pennies are reportedly hoarding together in coffee cans, preparing for what they call The Copper Rebellion.\
\
Stay tuned. Or better yet, just round up.\

I noticed that not constantly drinking water and constantly peeing every hour makes my bladder and urethra burn. I’ve had tons of UTI tests done (I was pregnant 1.5 years ago and just had another uti test for psych reasons) and no UTI. 

Today I had a bottle of water, a bottle of electrolyte powder with artificial sweetener, and a cup of coffee in like 6 work hours. Even that morning 2 hours in with the bottle of water and cup of coffee it was burning so bad and *cramping*. Like it felt like period cramps in my bladder, and I’m not on my period. 

Then when I peed, several times today, it was like I had a sense of urgency but could hardly go, I’d get up, and it would still feel like I had to go and would burn. It only goes away once I drink a ton of water at once and pee a few times.

1lgkff2,https://i.redd.it/2ibxujirl68f1.jpeg,Sweet Magnolia Coffee Former Employee Post Addressed / We Are Still Unable To Share Our Side On The Original Post,"Hi, we are coming to you with great concern about the post made regarding Sweet Magnolia Co. and Coffee House. As a team we have put our heart into this business, and it’s deeply upsetting to see a story so twisted and misleading being used to tarnish the reputation of a space that so many of us genuinely love and work hard for this company. The post that was made is not an honest account of what happened, and it leaves out a lot of context that completely changes the narrative.
To address the claims directly:

1.	“The owner asked for a tip back that the employee earned.”This is not an accurate account of what happened. At the time of the transaction, the owner was already on shift, and the employee in question had completed her shift and was no longer on the clock. She had stated she was making her own personal drink because she was off shift and there were no active customers. As part of our policy, employees are required to step out from behind the counter once their shift ends to preserve shift clarity and fairness in tip distribution. The employee took the $9 tip from a group that was served during the owner’s scheduled time. The owner was in the back cleaning up supplies that were left out during the employee’s shift. The owner was unaware anyone was there, however the employee had every opportunity to say to the owner that there were customers ready to order. 

2.	“Employees don’t clock in or out.”
We track hours manually. Each employee writes down the time they start and end their shift. If someone arrives late or stays later, they are paid for the actual time worked. Scheduled hours determine shift coverage, but no one works without being paid. And at the end of every shift each employee collects their tips and the owner never touches them. 

3.	“The owner confused the employee with another Hispanic girl.”
This accusation is inappropriate and false. We are proud to be a diverse, inclusive workplace where every employee is treated with respect, regardless of ethnicity. To suggest racial confusion without evidence is harmful and unfair.

4.	“The firing was retaliation for standing up for herself.”
This is simply not true. There had been multiple documented issues throughout the employee’s time here, including customer complaints and repeated mistakes with drink preparation. Those concerns were addressed more than once. The final situation regarding the tip was not isolated it was the final factor in a larger pattern of concerns, which led to a tough but necessary decision to end employment.

5.	“Espresso drinks are overpriced and poorly made.”
Our pricing reflects quality ingredients, operational costs, and the value of supporting a local small business. Regarding drink quality, we do not reuse espresso pucks under any circumstance. Our baristas are trained to follow proper espresso procedures, and if there was ever confusion, we encourage open and respectful communication to address it.

6.	“The owner claims tips if they fall outside of shift hours.”This is not true. We follow all Washington State labor laws regarding tip distribution. The owner, like every other staff member, works designated shifts meaning each person claims tips earned only during their scheduled individual work time. The employee in question had already ended her shift and, per policy, should not have remained behind the counter. She later admitted to claiming tips during another employee’s shift on more than one occasion, which directly goes against workplace policy. It’s the responsibility of management to ensure a fair environment where shift changes are respected and everyone is paid appropriately for the work they perform. We do not allow employees to remain on the floor after their shift in order to benefit from incoming tips meant for the next person on duty. The policies we follow protect fairness, accountability, and proper compensation across all shifts.
This post was made after the employee was let go, and at no point during her time here were these complaints ever brought up. To go online afterward and share only a one-sided version of events, without context or accountability, is harmful and misleading.

What’s worse is what this has caused for those of us still here. We’ve been receiving personal harassment through messages and social media, and it’s taken a serious emotional toll. Our workplace should feel safe and supportive not targeted by false claims.

It’s also incredibly frustrating to see that only negative comments are being kept up, while supportive ones, many from current staff and regular customers are being removed. That doesn’t create a balanced conversation. It feels like an attempt to fuel negativity and silence anyone who tries to speak the truth.

We’re not asking for blind support we’re asking for fairness. Please take a moment to consider both sides before judging a business that so many people love and work hard to keep running. Real people are being affected by these accusations, and they deserve honesty, not misinformation. Thank you for reading this

Sincerely,

You might find these stories unbelievable, but alas, not believing in gravity will not grant you the ability to fly. So take them for what they are.

During final presentation week, there was always a familiar sight of a long list of names on a taped sheet of paper by the communal plotters in the Maggie Mo and Fine Arts studios. The four plotters would be working all morning long as the entire student body rushed to print out their final presentation displays of renders, plans, and data, all carefully arrayed in a graphically pleasing fashion, not unlike those coffee table books on architecture one finds in big box stores. Indeed, they took time to achieve that high level of finish by the end of first year, so much time that they often forgot to plan to plot ahead and beat the rush. Thus, there were many an argument as they fought among themselves on who should truly be next to plot. Logically, those with morning presentation timeslots should go first, but I’ve seen the golden students with afternoon timeslots jump ahead, betraying friendships to do so. Of course, there was always that one group monopolizing the plotter, making it hard for others to get in line.

Now these plotters were running nonstop all day and prone to mechanical failures such as worn-out printer heads or depleted ink cartridges. The student technician would check each one every morning but by the afternoon, they would start having problems again from the sheer load of work and from impatient users being aggressive with the machines. Rather than walk to the office for assistance, other students would harass the student technician, even in the middle of classes, to go fix the plotters outside of his scheduled morning routine assigned by the school. To combat this and to avoid disputes on the finals queue, the kid came up with an off-the-record deal with the rest of the panicking students.

If he was bothered to fix the plotters outside his schedule during finals, then he would get to print his final presentation sheets as a “test plot.” At first, some of the rowdy students balked at this.

“How dare that kid try to jump the sacred queue!” they argued.

“Why interrupt my classes when that’s my morning job, not 24/7!” he countered. “Would you rather march back to the office and find someone on shift to do it?”

With time drawing short, the students monopolizing the plotter queue relented. Gone in a flash, the kid would return with new supplies for the plotter and set everything right. In a matter of minutes, the machine would be up and running and his plot would come out as proof of the repair. Without so much as a thank you, the rowdy students would then take over the plotter for their needs; but they never forgot the deal they made with the plotter tech, who since then never had to worry about getting his name on the queue.

Cheers,

The SoArch Tattler.

In a matter of minutes, the machine would be up and running and his plot would come out as proof of the repair. Without so much as a thank you, the rowdy students would then take over the plotter for their needs; but they never forgot the deal they made with the plotter tech, who since then never had to worry about getting his name on the queue.

Cheers,

However, the opening of Vanilla Romance isn't my favorite so I'm searching for a scent that's consistently like the dry down. Below is a list of the decants I have. If there's no note, I'm still trying to figure out my thoughts on it but they're definitely not close enough.

1lgkcsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/aiwars/comments/1lgkcsy/about_ai_slop_soul_and_public_perception/,"About ‘AI slop’, ‘soul’, and public perception","I’ve noticed that there’s a fundamental disconnect between how artists experience art creation and how the general public consumes art and media in daily life.

Much of the Pro-AI vs Anti-AI debate centers around this perceptual disconnect, which many artists don’t seem to fully recognize.

When artists see AI-generated content, they see the absence of the human journey of creation, the creative struggle that they believe infuses art with soul.

The artistic perspective ‘dissects’, it goes beyond the immediate perceptual experience of art and media. Artists and many on the Anti-AI side have developed a habit of seeking to understand the human behind the work, the intentionality, the years of practice, the emotional investment that went into every creative decision.

Artists have spent years developing this analytical lens. They can’t unsee the process, the shortcuts, the “authenticity” markers.

The disconnect happens when they project this perspective onto everyone else, assuming that what matters deeply to them should matter equally to the general public.

For most people consuming art and media daily, this analytical perspective simply doesn’t exist. People scrolling on social media don’t typically stop to wonder about the process. The general public tends to respond immediately to the end result, without deconstructing the methodology.

The general public isn’t contemplating the artist’s creative process any more than they wonder about the engineering behind their smartphone or the agricultural practices that produced their morning coffee. They’re consuming media for entertainment, information, emotional resonance, or simple distraction.

A significant portion of the Pro-AI side represents this perspective. Since they don’t share the same focus on process and the ingrained analytical framework of artists, they view AI as the democratization of art. For them, the process isn’t what matters as long as human intention for expression exists.

Both sides are talking past each other because they’re operating from completely different frameworks about what art is supposed to be and do. 

Until each side acknowledges that their perspective isn’t universal, these debates will continue to be exercises in mutual incomprehension rather than productive dialogue.

Imagine a massive open-world life simulator where you can live however you want — solo or with other players — in first or third person. Inspired by sandbox roleplay giants like Roblox, VRChat, FiveM, Garry’s Mod Dark RP, and Rec Room, this game lets you create your own roleplaying story or just live a chill virtual life.

Pick a role, build a life:
Become a cop, a chef, a mechanic, a business owner, or just vibe as a regular citizen. You can interact with both real players and AI NPCs in every corner of the world.

Own everything:
Buy homes, own businesses, run shops, or manage buildings. From luxury apartments to corner stores, it’s your empire to grow (or lose).

Real Jobs = Real Systems:
Every job has depth.
	•	Store clerks stock shelves, scan items, clean messes.
	•	Mechanics repair, replace, and maintain vehicles and gear.
	•	Office workers type, file documents, and manage tasks.
	•	Traders and shopkeepers can buy, sell, and barter with live players or AI NPCs using a player-driven economy system.

Money flows easy, but so does temptation:
Earn money through jobs, trades, or your own businesses. But with infinite things to buy — from cosmetics to vehicles to real estate — you’ll need to budget or blow it all on a mansion and hope for the best.

Cars, homes, emotes, and freedom:
Drive cars, decorate your house, host parties, roleplay with custom emotes, and group up with others. Want to form a gang? Run a hospital? Open a coffee shop? You can do it — or just hang out and people-watch.

Big world, not overwhelming:
The map is large and alive, but smartly designed so you don’t get lost. City hubs, districts, and landmarks keep you grounded while still feeling like there’s always something new around the corner.

It’s not just a game. It’s a platform for roleplay, storytelling, and chill sandbox living.suggestion, or a tagline to pair with this for Reddit or other pitches.",1,1750468333.0,gameideas,0,1.0,False
1lgkcc9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lgkcc9/how_to_stay_awake_during_daytime/,How to stay awake during daytime,"Hello all, i am having really bad trouble staying awake during the daytime.
Last week i quit my job of almost 3 years. I worked night shift in a warehouse. I did heavy physical labor for my ten hour shifts every single night and i’m saying that because it took a huge toll on my body. I pushed around a huge heavy metal orange cart with stacks of heavy totes on them and couldn’t take breaks other than the regular 2 fifteens and lunch. It got to me so bad that I would ask my leadership if i could work on station and it resulted to them saying no. I want to state that because after every shift i would collapse and sleep to the point where 7-8 hours didn’t feel like enough rest for me. I started waking up like a zombie every single day. I’m a 20 year woman (in 2 days i’ll be 21!!)  and at that time, i could only do night shift, it worked best with my schedule. 
On my weekends I would be sleeping for 12-16 hours and completely shut out my social life. I didn’t want to see anybody, hangout with anybody, talk to anybody, i just wanted to sleep. My boyfriend began getting concerned and asked me to quit for months but i couldn’t afford it. I hit my last straw last Friday and quit. I had an interview for Target today and we’ll see if i get the job. 
The problem is, i’m having trouble staying awake in the daytime. For the last 4 days i’ve been making myself sleep at 8:30 pm 9:00 pm the latest IF i can stay awake. I’ll wake up a few times throughout the night and see the time is 12:00pm-01:00am. I go back to bed and wake up around 06:00-08:00 am, an in between. I’ll do my productive things for the day and by 12:00 i’m ready to pass out. I know some may think, “Ok, so take a nap…?” My body just rejects naps, my naps will be 5-7 hours long. I physically cannot sleep for 30M-1H i feel DRAINED, i fall back asleep immediately. 
I’ve been taking iron supplements for a few weeks, vitamins, changed my eating habits to more healthy style, drinking lots of water. I feel like i can’t remember how to stay awake in the day time.
My boyfriend works night shift and he’s at work right now. I’ve been at his house the last 2 days and last night i made myself stay awake until 8:00pm, i was STRUGGLING. As soon as the time hit 8:00pm i PASSED out like a log. Woke up at 06:00 and waited for him to come home. Cleaned the kitchen, reorganized the living room, ate breakfast. He came home around 07:40 and fell asleep around 08:00. I’ve been awake and it’s 7:06pm right now and since 2:00pm i’ve been fighting to stay awake. 
Any tips? I drank a coffee around 2:00pm and it did absolutely nothing.
I used to drink coffee before my night shifts. which started at 6:00pm-04:30am. ",1,1750468294.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Im finding a late stage CA side affect that I'm getting is that I'll sleep with someone or be slept with by someone & I'm waking up having blacked out or browned out not having any memory of going home with someone. I feel problematic as the guy in the situation but like, who's the non consenting party if a girl drives me back to her place drunk @ the end of the night? Neither of us are capable of consenting right? If I wake up to some sexual advances that happened in my sleep I'm normally pretty thrilled with that but also knowing we did something the night before, I feel like the responsibility is on me even though I have no memory of it. 

I just feel like both an object & a predator @ the same time & it's not a fun mental or emotional journey to cope with. 

If you're a lady reading this, & you run into me @ a bar, I want you to know I've probably already had 15 drinks by the time I've seen you. You can take me home pretty easily but if you do just like, take me to my house & tuck me in I don't need this. 

Worrying about women or a pregnancy or something is the last thing I need let me just drink alone & let's not hit on each other cause obviously I can't resist, & I won't remember it anyways which really crushes the meaning of it all.

I just can't believe the amount of times I wake up naked somewhere.

1lgkawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/chronoodyssey/comments/1lgkawa/chrono_odyssey_probably_wont_save_the_genre_but/,"Chrono Odyssey Probably Won’t Save the Genre, But It Reminds You Why You Fell in Love with MMOs","Chrono Odyssey has my attention, but not my hype. I’ve learned the hard way that overhyping a video game is often the fastest route to disappointment. Somewhere along the line, enthusiasm became a performance. Social media success hinges on being loudly optimistic about every new MMORPG, as if each one is the genre’s final salvation. If you’re measured or critical, or worse, cautiously optimistic, you don’t trend. You just vanish.

I suppose that’s fine. I’m old. I remember Betamax.

I dove into Chrono Odyssey for the first time on 20 June 2025. That might surprise some people, since I usually approach a new game like a doctoral thesis. I consume everything—mechanics, lore, community takes—before I ever touch the keyboard. This time? I showed up unprepared and joked I’d be taking my F for skipping the reading. Felt weird. Still hit Start.

I was pleasantly surprised by Chrono Odyssey’s intro cinematic and character creator. The tools are stunning, living up to every expectation you’d have from a game built in Unreal Engine. My first character didn’t take long, since livestreaming limited how deep I could go, but even tossing on a few customizations gave me a clear sense of identity. Then, as I previewed the different armor sets, an idea hit me.

Imagine if, while creating your character, each outfit preview came with a short description: where it drops, what it means, how you earn it. That alone could hook certain players immediately. I might see a set of ranger furs and think, ""I want to look like that."" Then I learn it drops at level 40 after clearing a specific dungeon. Now I’ve got a goal. The developer has me locked in at least until I get there. Would it retain every player? No. Would it help retain some? Definitely. And that’s the game.

On the topic of player retention, Chrono Odyssey has a major problem: a lack of a substantial tutorial, no real easing in, and no early success moments to hook players. This will frustrate anyone new to this type of game. It is not the only issue, and other creators will highlight different flaws, but for me, how a game starts matters most. I do not mean the game should be easy. The challenge is part of the charm. What I care about is whether it is easy to play even when the content itself is difficult.

To be honest, I felt completely lost during my first hour in Chrono Odyssey. For me, that breaks immersion. When I can't figure out basic systems, I start itching to Google answers, and that is never a good sign. This wasn’t the good kind of challenge, like solving a puzzle or deciphering a map. That kind of frustration can be rewarding. Instead, I was told to level my mining to two, but the quest giver didn’t sell pickaxes, didn’t tell me who did, and no vendor nearby had one either. That kind of confusion doesn’t add depth. It just adds friction.

I stuck with the game, partly because I was enjoying the world and its difficulty, and partly because I was streaming. Eventually, I found the tools I needed to craft some gear. Why was I so focused on gearing up so early? I was tired of getting faceplanted by every single NPC I met. After running around mining, chopping trees, gathering plants, and skinning wolves, I finally cobbled together a full set of level five gear. When I returned to the world, every NPC was still planting me like a tomato in your grandfather’s garden. At least now, I felt properly dressed for the occasion.

After some wandering, I hit the first Chrono Cave and immediately got stuck. The back of the room was a door, but it didn’t look like one. Once I figured that out, I found myself dying repeatedly to the boss. Frustration started piling up, so I left the cave and returned to the open world.

What happened next surprised me. Places I had already visited now had new quests waiting. Maybe I reached a certain level, maybe dying to the boss triggered something, or maybe the server caught up. I honestly don’t know. What I do know is that the world suddenly felt alive.

Naked guy trapped on a rock near a waterfall? No problem, good sir—I will help you. Guy who wants me to take him to his farm so he can collect his wife’s things and then apparently take a header off the cliff? Absolutely. I will help you out and then accept your wife’s sickle as a thank-you. As I adventured (and it has been so long since I’ve been on a good adventure), I felt the world coming alive around me. This was due to facing adversity—and dare I say it? Failure.

This is exactly why Chrono Odyssey has me intrigued. Most MMORPGs from the past 15 years follow the same pattern: pick up a quest, kill a boss, move to the next hub, and repeat until you hit max level. That’s when the ""real"" game begins. Chrono Odyssey flips that on its head. It introduces something else entirely: frustration.

Even as I write this, I’m itching to get back in. I’m only level seven, but I want to see where the game takes me. More than that, I want the final piece to craft my green bow. I want another shot at the guy who is blocking my story progression. I want to be successful. I need to be successful.

That tunneling, chunneling, pug-faced blocker of my progress is going down.

By now, if you know me, you’re probably wondering where the sarcastic, sardonic, condescending, surgically analytical Jahlon of yesterday has gone. Where are the flaws? Where is the cutting feedback?

The truth is, I’m not qualified to talk about the biggest problem in this game: combat. I’ve said for years that I am not an action combat player, and I’m not about to pretend otherwise just to fit in with the trendy YouTuber, streamer, influencer crowd.

Do I think the combat is good? No, I do not. Do I think any action combat is good? Sometimes. Does this combat play well? In my experience, no. It doesn’t feel buttery smooth. It feels like a fifteen-year-old with a learner’s permit trying to drive grandma’s stick shift, double clutching, grinding gears, lurching hard enough to spill your coffee.

That’s the feedback from a tab-target player. If you are an action combat player and disagree, feel free to tell me. I will not argue with you. This just isn’t my domain.

In this game, my realm is gathering. The pace is slow—slow enough that most short-form content junkies with ADHD will probably bail on it. That works in my favor. I don’t mind a gathering animation that gives me time to sip coffee between trees and rocks. I will happily dominate the auction house with my hard-earned goods.

The artisan system, though, feels messy so far. Multiple gathering professions filter into one processing profession, which then branches into different crafting disciplines. I am not exactly thrilled by that setup, but I need more time with the game before passing final judgment.

Let’s talk about the other hot-button issue: pay-to-win. The developers have promised it will not be part of Chrono Odyssey. The monetization model is buy-to-play, with a cash shop focused on cosmetics and convenience items.

That brings out the Jahlon you know, whether you love him or hate him. I trust Kakao Games to avoid pay-to-win about as much as I trust John Smedley not to ruin another Star Wars Galaxies.

If anyone at Kakao is offended by that, that is fine. You have earned every inch of the reputation you carry as a game developer and publisher. You also have a chance to change it. Chrono Odyssey and Archeage Chronicles both have potential. This could be Kakao’s redemption arc, a chance to prove that a studio can make money with a box price and a fair cash shop.

The combat situation, the lack of a strong foundation tutorial, and the high potential for pay to win is why I am not about to rate this game as a 10. Or a 9. Or even an 8. Based on what I have seen, this game is a solid 7 with good bones, fair skin, and maybe a winning smile.

They need to invest more in the first hour or two. The tutorial should grab players and get them to turn off YouTube and pay attention. Fortunately, fixing that does not require hundreds of thousands of dollars. It only takes an extra line or two of dialogue in the right places.

They also need to keep their word on monetization. If the game slips into pay-to-win territory, people will leave. Some will post hateful comments about the game or this review simply because it is Kakao, or because it is a Korean MMO. I cannot even blame them. That reaction has become Pavlovian.

All we can do now is wait with bated breath, see if things improve, and use the closed beta to offer real feedback.",3,1750468167.0,chronoodyssey,4,0.62,False
