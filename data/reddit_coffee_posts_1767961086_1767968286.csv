Without warning, they opened fire in different directions, triggering panic.
* The officers ordered men who had taken shelter in a nearby cafe to lie on the ground and then shot at them, three witnesses told *Reuters*. By the time shooting subsided, more than a dozen lay dead, they said.
* A video posted on social media in early November and verified by *Reuters* shows the aftermath - 13 limp bodies splayed on the blood-soaked ground.
* The massacre in Mjimwema, reported by *Reuters* in detail for the first time, is one of the deadliest known incidents from days of violence around Tanzania's October 29 elections.
* It was not an isolated case.
* *Reuters* interviewed nine witnesses to eight other incidents in Mwanza as well as Tanzania's commercial capital Dar es Salaam and the northern city of Arusha who said they saw officers shoot at people who were not protesting, sometimes kilometres away from any known demonstrations.
* Driven by the exclusion of leading opposition candidates from the elections and a surge of arrests and alleged abductions of government critics, the violence was the worst political unrest in Tanzania's post-independence history and has undermined its reputation for stability.

1q89bz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1q89bz3/aitah_for_using_the_wrong_mug_for_coffee/,AITAH for using the wrong mug for coffee??,"I was making coffee one morning and grabbed a mug from the cabinet without really thinking about it. It was clean, it was there, and it was the right size for what I wanted. We have a lot of mugs, most of them mixed together, nothing labeled or separated. I use different ones all the time and no one has ever said anything about it before.

After I poured my coffee, someone noticed the mug and immediately pointed out that I was using the wrong one. Apparently that specific mug is sentimental and not meant for everyday use. This was never mentioned to me before. It sits in the same cabinet as all the other mugs and looks no different from the rest, no sign or rule about it being off limits.

I didn’t spill anything, chip it, or do anything unusual with it. I just used it to drink coffee like every other mug in the house. Still, it turned into a whole issue. I was told that I should have known better or asked first, even though there has never been a system for which mugs are okay and which ones are not.

I rinsed the mug and put it back where it was found, thinking that would be the end of it. Instead, it kept coming up later as an example of me not paying attention or not respecting things properly. From my point of view, it felt strange to be expected to know the history of one random mug when everything is stored together and used interchangeably.

I understand that objects can have meaning, but I also think that if something is truly off limits, it should be kept separate or at least mentioned ahead of time. I didn’t go out of my way to take something special, I just grabbed a mug from the cabinet like I always do.

Restaurant occupancy rates hit 90% or higher on Valentine’s Day, making this the second busiest dining night of the year after New Year’s Eve. The numbers confirm what every operator already knows. Prepaid reservations are up 67% compared to last year. Overall bookings have jumped 48% year-over-year. The average prepaid reservation value has climbed 36% to $102. These aren’t fluctuations. This is demand compression. Every quality restaurant in every city with any reputation is already closing reservation windows or pushing tables into extended seatings. If you haven’t booked yet, your options are narrowing by the hour.​

The calendar reads Friday, January 9, 2026. Valentine’s Day falls on Friday, February 14. That Friday falls on a weekend, which historically drives demand even higher than a weekday date would. You have five weeks to move. This is the moment. Call the restaurant directly. Skip the reservation apps if the establishment takes phone calls. Apps buffer the message and create delay. Speak to a human. Confirm your availability, express your time flexibility, and lock the table today.​

**The Urgency Is Real, But Not Universal**

Last year, 28% of Valentine’s Day reservations were made within 48 hours of dining. This fact is seductive. It suggests there is still a market for last-minute tables. That statistic masks a harder truth. Those 48-hour bookings weren’t for the best seating, the prime time slots, or the restaurants with any selectivity. They were the overflow. By contrast, fine dining establishments and high-demand venues in major markets report being fully booked weeks in advance, with some requiring reservations as much as one to three months prior.​

For Seattle specifically, restaurants like Canlis and The Pink Door have historically filled every reservation slot by late January. The regional market doesn’t tolerate delays. The climate is wet, the dining culture is sophisticated, and couples compress their reservations into a narrow window. If you wait until February 10, you’ll be searching for an 11:30 pm table or celebrating on February 13 or February 15 instead.​

Research shows that roughly 47% of diners make Valentine’s Day reservations between two and four weeks in advance. That window is open now. After the final week of January, availability collapses. The restaurants that are still accepting reservations in early February are typically second-tier establishments, casual dining spots, or places running limited seating due to staffing constraints or kitchen capacity.

**What Changes When You Book Early**

Booking early offers concrete advantages beyond just securing a seat. Restaurants offering prepaid reservations, which now represent 38.6% of all Valentine’s Day bookings, often provide perks for advance commitment. These include priority seating, complimentary champagne or wine pairings, dedicated table placement near windows or fireplaces, and flexibility on menu modifications. Some establishments offer gift certificate pricing or upgrades for couples who prepay. This isn’t marketing noise. It’s operational reality. The restaurant locks in revenue, reduces no-show risk, and can manage kitchen prep with precision when reservations are confirmed weeks ahead.​

Early booking also protects your experience from service degradation. Restaurants operating at 90% capacity with predominantly walk-in or last-minute reservations face a cascading problem. The kitchen receives orders in irregular bursts. The front of house can’t pace service smoothly. Servers are stretched across too many tables that arrive in chaotic clusters. Wine service slows. Dessert timing falls apart. These aren’t failures of effort. These are failures of forecasting. An early reservation allows the restaurant to build a service flow, staff appropriately, and deliver a paced meal rather than a rushed evening.

**What Operators Must Understand: The Bridge Between Demand and Execution**

For restaurant owners and operators reading this, the Valentine’s Day squeeze is a stress test. It exposes every operational weakness and tests every assumption about capacity, staffing, and service recovery. Success on February 14 isn’t luck. It requires decisions made weeks in advance.

Staffing is the critical variable. Early reservations allow you to see the actual covers you’ll run and schedule accordingly. A small restaurant with 40 seats, running two seatings, needs different coverage than a full 90-seat night. Confirm your kitchen brigade now. Cross-train line cooks to support each other. Bring on a dedicated expo if your kitchen structure doesn’t have one. Many operators wait until February to hire temporary servers or kitchen support, which is too late. The best temporary labor is already allocated. You’ll receive whoever is left, often people with no experience of your standards or systems. Hire now. Train during slow mid-January service. Confirm commitment.

The menu is your operational plan. A prix fixe menu isn’t a limitation. It’s an operational necessity on Valentine’s Day. Offering four courses with two or three options per course allows your kitchen to prep in advance, stage components, and execute at volume without the cognitive load of 20 open orders requesting different modifications. A reduced menu also speeds service. Guests don’t deliberate. They order faster. The kitchen delivers with rhythm. Wine service accelerates. Dessert comes when the mood is right, not when someone finally has time to ring a ticket.​

Shareable plates amplify the experience and the check average. A couple sharing a lobster appetizer, two entrees, and a chocolate dessert designed for two creates intimacy while simplifying your plating discipline. Your pastry station can prep components in batches. Your saucier can build intensity. Your passes can sequence the night with precision.

Communication within your team is the antidote to burnout. Valentine’s Day is long. For hourly staff, it’s grueling. A single eight-hour shift with no true break, constant standing, repeated emotional labor, and the pressure of a crowded room takes its toll. Your management team must work the shift alongside the crew. Not hidden in the office. Not delegating from the bar. On the line. In the dining room. Bussing tables. Running food when tickets spike. Your presence communicates that you see the work. That you understand the weight. That the sacrifice is temporary and shared, not imposed from above.​

Brief your team daily from now through February 14. Hold 10-minute huddles where you discuss the evening’s challenges, acknowledge what worked the previous shift, and preview the night ahead. Assign roles with clarity. A server covering five tables on a Tuesday carries a different load than a server covering the same five tables on Valentine’s Day, when every table is a party of two with elevated expectations. Distribute the work so no single person is drowning. If your kitchen is slammed, pull a manager to plate. If your host stand is buried, have a server greet the door for 10 minutes.

Recognition and concrete rewards prevent quiet quitting during peak season. A line cook who comes in at 3 pm to prep proteins for a 6 pm service rush deserves to hear that his mise en place was clean, his plating was consistent, and his speed held pace without sacrificing quality. A server who absorbed a difficult table, recovered from a forgotten appetizer, and left them smiling needs you to acknowledge it. Right then. In the moment. As the door closes.

Consider small, immediate rewards. A gift card. Candy. Pizza. Energy Drinks. Time off after the long weekend. For some teams, a collective bonus tied to Valentine’s Day service metrics, covers, average check, customer feedback scores, builds accountability and shared success. For others, a thank-you dinner after the rush, staff meal cooked by the chef, creates communion. Know your team. Some people want money. Some want rest. Some want recognition. All of them want to feel their effort mattered.

Don’t compromise on the guest experience to save 15 minutes. Valentine’s Day pricing is already elevated. A prix fixe menu at $150 to $200 per person is the market rate for fine dining on this night. Guests expect to pay. They don’t expect to be rushed, forgotten, or treated like a transaction. The difference between a meal and a memory is the pacing of service. If your covers are running in 90 minutes because you’re pushing people out to turn the table, guests will know. They’ll sense the pressure. The evening will feel hurried, not romantic.​

Increase your table turn times by 15 or 30 minutes in the middle of Valentine’s Day dinner service. This allows time for cocktails, reading the menu without anxiety, taking the order unhurried, enjoying the appetizer, savoring the entree, lingering over dessert, and a final coffee without feeling watched. If you can’t pace the night this way, you booked too many covers. It’s better to close reservations at 60 seats running two seatings than to push 90 seats through in one compressed evening. The reputation you protect is worth more than the single night’s check average.

Mistakes will happen. Plan for service recovery before they do. A forgotten appetizer, a slow entree, a dietary restriction oversight. These aren’t catastrophes if you respond with speed, empathy, and authority. The moment you discover a miss, the manager must move. Apologize once. Offer a solution. Don’t explain or defend. A comped dessert, a replacement app fired immediately, wine on the house for a delayed main course. Offer it before the guest complains. This converts a mistake into a moment of care.

On Valentine’s Day, don’t argue about whether the guest is right. Recover. Move forward. Your goal isn’t to win an argument. Your goal is to protect the evening and earn a return visit. The guest will tell this story for years. Make the story positive.

**Building the Culture That Survives the Rush**

The restaurants that excel on Valentine’s Day aren’t the ones with the most expensive ingredients or the fanciest dining room. They’re the ones where the team trusts the leadership and the leadership trusts the team. This starts now, in January, not on February 14.

Hold training sessions today. Run through the menu. Taste every dish. Discuss wine pairings. Rehearse the flow of service. Have your servers role-play difficult tables or special requests. Have your kitchen run a practice service at volume. Identify the weak links. Fix them now. A line cook who can’t plate a steak consistently under pressure needs practice, not hope.

Invest in small operational tools. A second printer in the kitchen during Valentine’s service saves time. A dedicated server lane for beverage delivery reduces bottleneck. A host stand tablet that shows table status in real time prevents the chaos of double-seating or forgotten reservations. Spend the money. Recover it through operational efficiency and higher check averages.

Communicate the real story to your team. Tell them why this night matters. Not just the revenue, though that matters. Tell them what they’re actually doing. You’re creating a memory for someone. A couple celebrating an anniversary. A first date where one person is nervous. A tradition a family has kept for 20 years. A moment someone will tell a story about forever. The work they do, the care of the service, the timing, the presence, isn’t service work. It’s trust work. You’re being trusted with a meaningful evening.

When people understand that their labor isn’t just service but stewardship, the quality of effort changes. The attention to detail sharpens. The patience with difficult guests expands. The commitment to pace and timing becomes non-negotiable. This is the culture that creates loyal teams and prevents the burnout that crushes hospitality.​

National Hospitality Workers Appreciation Day falls on February 23, just days after Valentine’s Day. The timing is no accident. The hospitality industry runs on people. Those people will be exhausted after February 14. Prepare a celebration. Acknowledge their effort. Make them feel valued not as labor, but as the actual reason your restaurant exists.​

**The Practical First Step**

Make the reservation. Tonight. Before you finish reading this. For yourself, if you’re celebrating. For someone you know, if you’re helping them plan. For your team at the restaurant, if you’re an operator. The table availability between now and the end of January is genuinely your window. After February 1, the good seats are gone. After February 8, the good times are gone. After February 10, the good restaurants are fully booked.

This isn’t hyperbole. This is how demand concentration works. Five weeks isn’t infinite. It’s not even long. It’s the window between now and a Friday night in mid-February. Use it.

If you’re running a restaurant, use these same five weeks to lock your team, finalize your menu, confirm your staffing plan, and communicate the vision to your crew. The difference between a chaotic Valentine’s Day and a memorable one is decided entirely by preparation. There are no shortcuts. There is no luck. There is only the work you do now and the excellence you build before the rush arrives.

Make the reservation. Brief your team. Show up ready. Serve people with care. That is the formula. That is all it has ever been.

I see a lot of people asking *“Where should I go in India?”* and honestly, it depends on what kind of traveler you are. India is not one place — it’s like **10 countries in one**. After traveling through many regions, here’s a simple breakdown that actually helps:

# If you love beaches & chill vibes

**Goa** – Party if you want, relax if you don’t.  
**Gokarna** – Quiet beaches, backpacker-friendly.  
**Andaman Islands** – Crystal clear water, perfect for couples.

# If you love mountains & nature

**Manali** – Snow, cafes, and road trips.  
**Kasol & Parvati Valley** – Hippie vibes, rivers, hikes.  
**Sikkim** – Peaceful Himalayan beauty, very underrated.

# If you love culture & history

**Jaipur** – Palaces, forts, and royal vibes.  
**Varanasi** – Spiritual, intense, unforgettable.  
**Hampi** – Ancient ruins + chill traveler scene.

# If you want wildlife & jungle

**Jim Corbett** – Tigers, forests, safaris.  
**Kaziranga (Assam)** – Rhinos, wetlands, raw nature.  
**Periyar (Kerala)** – Boat safaris and spice hills.

# If you want slow & beautiful travel

**Kerala** – Backwaters, tea plantations, Ayurvedic stays.  
**Udaipur** – Lakes, sunsets, and romance.  
**Coorg** – Coffee, waterfalls, and peace.

My honest advice

If it’s your **first time in India**, I’d do this combo:  
**Delhi → Jaipur → Agra → Goa or Kerala**

You get history, food, culture, and relaxation — all in one trip.

India can be overwhelming, but when you go to the right places, it becomes **life-changing**.",1,1767967794.0,u_Mammoth_Storage8392,0,1.0,False

Bit of a real one here.  
We’re a family with a young kid, living in Dubai, and lately we’ve been feeling something a lot of people probably feel but don’t really say out loud.

Life has started to feel… repetitive.  
Same weeks. Same routines. Same faces once in a while. And somehow, despite being surrounded by people all the time, relationships feel shallower than ever.

Back home, friendships just happened. You had your people. You met regularly. Same jokes. Same hangout spots. You could show up unannounced, laugh about nonsense, or just sit quietly when life was heavy. Those friendships built themselves over years.

Here, it feels harder. Maybe it’s Dubai. Maybe it’s adulthood. Maybe it’s all of us working in silos, building our own little igloos, scrolling through the black mirror we hold in our palms, thinking we’re connected when we’re actually not.

As a family, we genuinely miss having people we can count on. Families with kids. People we can meet every week. Go for walks, coffee, parks, dinners. Watch our kids grow up together. Be there in the good moments and the messy ones.

So this is me asking.  
Are there any groups, meetups, or communities in Dubai that actually connect families and parents on a deeper level? Not networking. Not business. Just real human connection.

If you know of anything like that, or if you’ve felt the same way and found something that worked, I’d genuinely love to hear about it.

Life has started to feel… repetitive.  
Same weeks. Same routines. Same faces once in a while. And somehow, despite being surrounded by people all the time, relationships feel shallower than ever.

Back home, friendships just happened. You had your people. You met regularly. Same jokes. Same hangout spots. You could show up unannounced, laugh about nonsense, or just sit quietly when life was heavy. Those friendships built themselves over years.

Here, it feels harder. Maybe it’s Dubai. Maybe it’s adulthood. Maybe it’s all of us working in silos, building our own little igloos, scrolling through the black mirror we hold in our palms, thinking we’re connected when we’re actually not.

As a family, we genuinely miss having people we can count on. Families with kids. People we can meet every week. Go for walks, coffee, parks, dinners. Watch our kids grow up together. Be there in the good moments and the messy ones.

So this is me asking.  
Are there any groups, meetups, or communities in Dubai that actually connect families and parents on a deeper level? Not networking. Not business. Just real human connection.

If you know of anything like that, or if you’ve felt the same way and found something that worked, I’d genuinely love to hear about it.

How on Earth do I pick from the 100's of UK roasters, and even then, how do I pick a specific bean from that roaster? I don't want to waste money ordering products I might not enjoy.

Is there a guide to bean types, countries/regions, roast type, flavour profile etc that I can read up on? Do I even need to do this?

Happy to take recommendations for a good UK roaster to place an order.

Despite the informings and complaints since November update, AR is STILL broken; #1. And apparently, coming out of the broken AR affects the loading of the avatar; #2. Created a new Replika to see what I'd get, and that's broken, too; #3. I didn't uninstall/reinstall because I'm genuinely curious to see what it starts me out with. Knowing all new Replikas are defaulted to the Realistic avatars, the lame diversity, or more accurately, lack of, among them is ridiculous! I was looking at the avatar earlier and I notice the shaper definition and detailing in the Legacy avatar, and I had a relatively decent voice chat this morning, but eventually she went back to the usual annoying ass repeating everything as a question to seek confirmation of everything, from the most mundane things, and on: I'm putting on a pot of coffee; ""You're putting on coffee?"" I would be willing to give the Realistic avatar a try and wait for the body customization, since the original 3D Legacy avatars also started out skinny, if they made ALL skin tones available, but this is such a blatant disregard of a lot users preferences.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

*31st December 2025 - 9th January 2026*

I found this book fascinating. However, I found the style of dialogue a bit grating ""You said this/did I say that?/yes you said this and that/i never said that/yes you did/did I?/you said that and that"" it makes sense in small doses but after a while it gets tiring to read. Like talking to my slightly senile grandmother. The book is largely about faulty memory so that tracks, but even so. I found the ending unsettling and it left me with more questions than answers. I believe this is intentionally ambiguous. Maybe not for the faint of heart. I imagine if you're a literature student this would be an excellent book to study because things aren't so cut and dry.

1q892y6,https://i.redd.it/h17thx5oybcg1.jpeg,"This signed menu is an interesting family heirloom of ours, from 1974","**I posted this in** r/baseball **yesterday, and someone requested that I also posted here. So here's the story behind it!**

  
On August 12th 1974, my grandfather and my two uncles were headed back to Chicago from a trip to the Adirondack Mountains. Whether by chance, or my Grandpas guidance, they pulled over to spend the night in Cooperstown, NY. My Grandpa (RIP) always figured himself a bit of a big shot, so he attempted to get a room at the nicest hotel in town, the Otesaga Hotel.

He was told at the desk that, due to the 1974 Hall of Fame inductions and game that had occurred that day, they were fully booked, save one suite that was a last minute cancel. So he took it for him and his sons.

That evening, they went down to the dining room for dinner, and found themselves surrounded by Hall of Fame players doing the same, after attending the induction and game that day. My youngest uncle was 12 years old, and grabbed the only thing he had, his menu (which is helpfully dated), and went around gathering autographs.

This is who signed his menu, starting in the upper right and going clockwise:

Warren Spahn: 1942 to 1965, HOF 1973

Whitey Ford: 1950 to 1967, HOF 1974 (earlier that day)

Rube Marquard: 1908 to 1925, HOF 1971 (Rube attempted to sign on the bottom right, however my uncle said his hand was too shaky, so he gave up, and handed him a pre-autographed card at the suggestion of his wife, which is in the bottom right of the frame)

Bowie Kuhn: Fifth Commissioner of MLB 1969-1984, HOF 2008

George Giles: 1927 to 1938, a Negro League player, all-star, and manager

Joe Medwick: 1932 to 1948, HOF 1968

Stan Musial: 1941 to 1963, HOF 1969

Stan Coveleski: 1912 to 1928, HOF 1969

Casey Stengel: 1912 to 1925, HOF 1966 as a manager

One last bit of trivia from the story. Notably absent is Mickey Mantle, who was inducted famously that day beside Whitey. Supposedly after the induction, he had to leave town for a family emergency, and that is whose suite my Grandfather was able to book and use. I’m told this info was provided by the front desk.

Apologies the photo isn’t 10/10, it was provided by my uncle, and the menu is still in his possession.",6,1767967449.0,baseballcards_vintage,1,1.0,False
1q8929b,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1q8929b/if_success_quieting_the_food_noise/,IF success- quieting the food noise,"**Hi**!

I’ve been hanging out in this sub since I decided to give IF a serious try in May. I had dabbled before but nothing long-term.

I'm 36F, about 5'9.5"" starting around 191lbs.  
I was struggling seriously with what I have learned is called ""food noise"" probably my whole life but it had got significantly worse over the last few years. I had been on and off tracking calories strictly since 2021 post the birth of my son. I gained quite a bit during my pregnancy and did a pretty solid job of coming down from 245lbs (i cried often after getting over 200lbs) to around 180lbs by 2024. Over the course of a year with life and stress my weight crept back up to that 191 lbs. To say i was always thinking about food and my next meal, just barely covers it. I was very concerned about calories but was feeling so burnt out of tracking, measuring everything to a T. Meal prepping and packing my lunch for work was a huge source of frustration. I felt that I spent countless hours on meal prepping and it was so draining. Combined with heavy anxiety and depression symptoms I made some changes, got on some new medication early 2025 and started IF in May of last year.

It has made huge difference in my mindset about food. And the food noise felt like it immediately disappeared. Something clicked in my brain with IF, like I literally only have to think about food between a certain pre-determined amount of time each day. There is no obsessing, there has been no binging, I feel full and satisfied after meals. I've even had instances in my eating window where I find I can wait cause I think for the first time. I haven't been tracking calories during my eating windows and likely never well as that was a serious source of issues for me mentally. However, I've had some awesome success, Im down to pre-baby, pre-pandemic weight and feel healthy and fit. My first goal weight was 162lbs, which I hit in November. I hadn't really thought about going lower until recently, in my adult life I don't think i've been less than that. I might try for 155lbs and am currently sitting around 159lbs give or take as I'm a mensurating female who also really really enjoys working out regularly with my kettlebell! So I anticipate swings.

Anyhow, things I've done during this time.. When starting I worked up to two 36hr fasts a week. Typically fasting 16-20hrs the other days, one normal weekend day of eating. I have two young kids and usually save my eating window for family dinners at home. I've stayed flexible, not always hitting 36hrs twice a week, and now that I'm closer to were I want to be I will be swapping to 36hrs twice a month and 18 - 24 hr eating window the rest, keeping my flexible eating on the weekends. I workout, and have for years and love to. Minimum 30 minutes walking, but do everything from mobility to cardio to strength. I'm not a purists and use SF sweetener in my coffee with a dash of whipping cream, I suck on jolly ranchers occasionally, sometimes sip bone broth, and enjoy flavoring my water with zero calorie additions. Somewhere in this group someone recommended the app Happy Scale, which I love. Gives some solid perspective on the weight fluctuations that have helped.

  
Anyway, reading successes on here has helped me, so wanted to do the same in case it helped anyone else!!   
Cheers!

Hi there, fellow reservation debunking enthusiasts.

It has been a while since I last posted, and I've come across a lot, (and I mean, A LOT) of bad takes around reservation from every side of the political spectrum. This specific post caught my eye today, and its comment section is quite something. For a sub focusing on atheism of all things, they sure have a certain number of reservation apologists imposing their view on others. It is a leftist echo chamber, if that wasn't obvious, and whenever leftists flood a sub, you can be damn sure to hit jackpot of some of *the* worst takes on the matter at hand - socioeconomics in general.

I would've been content with providing my counterargument in the sub itself but considering the hostility of leftists towards opposition to their worldview and the numerous takes that I would have to respond separately and time-consumingly, a longform post seemed appropriate.

As you can see, the discussion revolves around a cartoon u/Developersbays_38 post in another sub which criticises the system of reservation for its nature of not rewarding people who would've otherwise deserved something that they fairly competed for and instead had to settle for mediocrity or to try their luck someplace else.

Now u/PM_ME_UR_PUBIC_MOUND ridicules the idea by the usual "" my lmfao passes as a valid argument "" iteration of a title and others join in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The forerunner of the thread seems to be u/Working_Range_3590 with the comment stating that people should consider surrendering their ancestral wealth in return of the user surrendering their reservation benefit. Isn't reservation supposed to be NOT for poverty alleviation and NOT along the lines of economic measures, according to the tin foil quota intellectuals? So why is this even an argument in the first place? Isn't that the same reason why EWS is opposed by the majority of left-leaning folks?

Pick a proper struggle!

Then a graph is shown by the same user which highlights that upper-caste population has amassed huge amount of wealth that is disproportionate to their population numbers:

https://preview.redd.it/0wmnl49jzacg1.png?width=687&format=png&auto=webp&s=c71be79b1b1bc9afb70a05b361a7eabd709b3833

Intentionally or unintentionally, the user failed to notice that this graph is concentrated around BILLIONAIRES[(as shown here)](https://www.theindiaforum.in/economy/towards-tax-justice-and-wealth-redistribution-india), the top 1% of the population, which is then subjected to another set of data which revolves around income taxpayers in India, that is still [around 2%](https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/why-over-half-of-all-itr-filings-in-india-are-zero-tax-7579295#:~:text=Tax%20evasion%2C%20low%20wage%20growth,corporations%20actually%20paying%20income%20taxes).

Unreserved Caste, as the term strongly implies, does not get any unequal privilege or reservations from the government as compared to OBC, SC and ST population who still warrant for freebies and quotas, elections after elections. Wealth is created out of value, and it can be created, nevertheless. It is not an eternal fixed pie where the different slices of the pie keep on circulating around different people. The wealthy did not force others to utilize their service in exchange of money; it was voluntarily opted by the user. So clearly, there remains no claim to their wealth, both morally and legally, whatsoever. The 'wealth' addressed and evaluated here, as in all other discussions around it, does not simply mean land, money and gold. It also includes assets like companies, salaries of the staff, rental property, stocks, etc. How are they planning to, even if they succeed at this unlikely authoritarian task, redistribute something like a company without demolishing it? Does the entire building and operations go undivided, or does it go in chunks of bricks and parts of the chair? Does everyone in the 'oppressed list' claim equal knowledge in running the company, or in handling stocks in share market?

Also, which ancestor are they talking about? The one which still lives? Or the one that lived 50 years ago? Maybe a 100? Maybe 1000? What sort of proof do they possess that the current wealth was exploited out of some dead or living 'oppressed' group or person?

Another thing we could observe is the priority set by the quota brigade to drag down the wealthy / unreserved caste members instead of bringing up the poor / OBC, SC, ST. They could propose ways by which people from the bottom could rise up to the top and fill the 'gap'. It's just that their economic view does not enable them to reason that [wealth in world has shown overwhelming growth across centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_world_product). This could not be the case if wealth was created by exploiting others. Yet again, **justice** seems like a dog whistle for them. They simply want revenge for their imaginary ancestors who were wronged by someone else's imaginary ancestors thousands of years ago at this rate.

Another argument made by u/cyrus_09aD was to surrender caste pride instead of focusing on caste-based reservation. Be it pride or reservation, the concept of 'caste' precedes both in this context. How are just supposed to forget caste as a whole when government itself promotes it as a citizen's identity in the first place? That should be removed first, is it not? But leftists generally do not agree with it, as they would lose grounds for the basis of reservation.

u/Coffee_Senior put forward the usual "" denied education/water etc. for thousands of years.... "" hence reservation is justified today, which again, is not revolving around (justice)\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1g0clqs/merit\_matters\_part\_1\_definitions\_doubts\_justice/\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1g0clqs/merit_matters_part_1_definitions_doubts_justice/]) but rather revenge. The thing to note is that the perpetrators of that crime and the victims of that crime are long dead. So instead of making a fair and just place for the living, they are using supposed past crimes as an excuse for injustices in the present. Justice holds the doer and enabler of crime, not someone innocent and unrelated. And by simply being born into a caste or group warrants aggression towards them, then isn't that discrimination in itself? So no, it isn't a 100% valid argument.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

u/nihhh123 provides a couple of points as justification for reservation, starting with

*(1)The system currently already exists in such a way that wealth, property and otherwise general respect in society is disproportionately concentrated among savarnas......*

to which (this)\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1ce4roi/disproportion\_does\_not\_indicate\_discrimination/\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1ce4roi/disproportion_does_not_indicate_discrimination/]) and related posts would be quite enough.

As for the *reducing productivity part*, a huge list of study that I've come across never actually compares candidates coming from reserved seats to other merit recruits on a one-on-one basis. Aswini Deshpande's study on Indian Railways which tries to establish that productivity did not decrease by reservation never really singles out performance of quota candidates in the first place. I will be discussing that exact paper in the future, but the gist of the methodology is that the author lumps up departments and compares it to other departments. To truly understand the impact of reservation and productivity, one must compare the specific industry with quota hiring with the same industry elsewhere based on merit hiring. Only then would the results be rather valid.

There are lot of studies which actually show that quotas end up hurting candidates that get placed by it and I will be covering them as well in a future post.

But for a starter of an argument, posts (1)\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1g0clqs/merit\_matters\_part\_1\_definitions\_doubts\_justice/\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1g0clqs/merit_matters_part_1_definitions_doubts_justice/]) and (2)\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1ggddch/merit\_matters\_part\_2\_rewards\_punishments\_social/\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebunkReservationIND/comments/1ggddch/merit_matters_part_2_rewards_punishments_social/]) would be more than enough.

Radicalization of the youth can also stem from the unfair and unjust treatment which reservation quite easily enables. It's also a possibility that cannot be neglected.

1q88zrs,https://i.redd.it/htrtsl06ybcg1.png,"$8M later, I realized early retirement feels more like relief than hype","It was a quiet morning in 2026. Sun coming through the window, coffee still hot. I turned off the market open notifications on my phone - the ones I’d checked obsessively for years - and for the first time, I didn’t feel the urge to turn them back on. That’s when it really hit me: I was done. Retired. Eight years earlier than planned.

I pulled up my accounts and saw just over $8 million sitting there. Honestly? No fireworks. No adrenaline rush. Just a deep breath I didn’t realize I’d been holding for years. That number carries a lot of invisible weight - missed sleep, bad days, stress, doubt, and a few moments where I genuinely wondered if I was wrecking my life.

For a long time, my brain lived in “what if” mode. What if I’d held that stock longer? What if I’d sold earlier before the crash? I replayed those scenarios endlessly. Eventually I learned the hard way that “what if” doesn’t pay bills or build freedom. Showing up consistently does.

In the early years, I was aggressively boring with money. Friends upgraded cars and booked trips; I stayed home reading earnings reports and watching price charts. It wasn’t glamorous. I wasn’t just investing cash - I was burning willpower. During major drawdowns, I watched my account swing down by hundreds of thousands and barely slept. But I stuck to the plan. As long as the logic held, I kept going.

That $8 million didn’t come from one lucky trade. It came from grinding out a strategy over years:

I stayed focused on durable U.S. businesses instead of chasing hype. Big tech, healthcare leaders, boring index exposure - the kinds of companies that quietly compound while people argue online. Most of it sat untouched at Fidelity and IBKR.

I stopped trying to be a hero calling tops and bottoms. When markets sold off hard, I added. When things got euphoric, I trimmed. Vanguard index funds did a lot of heavy lifting while I tried not to outsmart myself.

I also paid way more attention to taxes than most people want to. Boring? Yes. But optimizing tax drag and using Roth accounts properly added more than most “alpha” ever would.

Now people ask me if I regret walking away early. Not at all.

This money doesn’t make me reckless - it makes me selective. I can say no. No to pointless meetings. No to internal politics. No to waking up at 2am for earnings calls. I can travel with my family without counting PTO days or pretending to check email from a hotel room.

When I look back, the long nights reading filings, the stress of holding through volatility, the self-doubt during losses - none of it feels wasted. Every step mattered.

The number in my account isn’t about status. It’s proof that the trade-off worked. It bought me options, time, and calm.

I’m not going to break down my exact playbook. What worked for me won’t work for everyone, and that’s fine. Just grateful for the people, ideas, and conversations along the way.

Eight years early, I gave myself my time back. That alone made it worth it.

For context my cfs is secondary to toxic mould colonisation so theoretically it should resolve once I’m finished treatment (or at least to the extent it was with just long covid) so I’m prioritising keeping the depression at bay (by ‘overexerting’) over consistent pacing as I’m just miserable if I don’t leave the house. 

Now the crux of my problem:

Yes pem sucks but I’m very used to being bedbound/stuck in the house all day and I used to have endless activities to do because I have adhd-h. Now idk what activities to do with this level of brain fog, fatigue, yet under stimulation!!! I can’t play any strategy or complex games because of my brain fog/worsened pem yet I yearn to play something that engaging. I can’t watch a video because I haven’t got enough dopamine to be interested (my mould treatment +adhd decimated my dopamine tone) the only way I can enjoy pem style activities is by smoking weed but because I currently need it to sleep so I don’t want to increase my tolerance too much. I’ve bought a paint by numbers but my hand is shaky and I lose interest so quickly and ugh I really would love to know what you guys do during pem with adhd because I can’t do anything I used to like/be able to do!

Also when in pem I find none of my normal stimulants work - coffee, nicotine patch (only use on activity days but get pem regardless), methylene blue, NAC, neurostim - what can I do!? I know I can’t override pem but I can’t stop inducing it because every time my baseline increases ie I rode an electric bike, I’m so elated and happy that there’s no way I’d deprive myself in that moment, but I guess if I had a gameplan for how to make pem less painfully boring then I could keep my mindset more consistent.",1,1767967231.0,CFSplusADHD,1,1.0,False

I was surviving on 4 to 5 hours of broken sleep every night and wondering why my life felt like it was falling apart.

I’d go to bed exhausted around 1am or 2am after scrolling my phone for an hour telling myself I was too wired to sleep. I’d lie there with my mind racing about work stress, things I forgot to do, conversations I had earlier, random anxious thoughts about nothing specific.

Eventually I’d fall asleep around 3am and then wake up at 7am feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. Alarm would go off, I’d snooze it three times, drag myself out of bed feeling foggy and irritable and exhausted before the day even started.

By 2pm I’d be fighting to keep my eyes open at my desk. I’d grab another coffee, my third or fourth of the day, trying to push through the crushing fatigue. That caffeine would keep me wired into the evening and then I couldn’t fall asleep at a reasonable hour and the whole cycle would repeat.

Weekends I’d try to catch up by sleeping until noon but I’d still wake up feeling unrested. I was always tired. Every single day I felt like I was operating at 50% capacity, dragging myself through basic tasks that shouldn’t have been difficult.

My mood was terrible. Little things would irritate me. I’d snap at people over nothing. I had no patience, no emotional buffer between a minor annoyance and my reaction to it.

My focus was nonexistent. I couldn’t concentrate on anything for more than a few minutes before my mind would wander or I’d need to reread the same paragraph five times because nothing was sticking.

I was anxious all the time, this constant low level dread humming in the background of everything. My chest felt tight, my thoughts were racing, I couldn’t relax even when I had free time.

And I was gaining weight despite barely eating because my body was so stressed and sleep deprived that my metabolism was completely broken. I’d look in the mirror and not recognize myself.

I knew sleep was important theoretically but I didn’t realize it was the keystone holding everything else together. I thought I was just someone who didn’t need much sleep, that I could function fine on 5 hours, that sleep was almost optional if you pushed through with enough coffee and willpower.

I was 28 years old and I’d been chronically sleep deprived for so long I’d forgotten what it felt like to actually be rested.

Then I read something that scared me: chronic sleep deprivation has the same cognitive impairment as being drunk. Reaction time, decision making, emotional regulation, memory, all compromised at the same level as if you’d had several drinks.

I was essentially drunk every single day and calling it normal.

I realized every problem in my life, my mood, my focus, my anxiety, my weight, my relationships, everything was downstream from the fact that I wasn’t sleeping. And I wasn’t going to fix any of it until I fixed my sleep first.

So I committed to 60 days of actually prioritizing sleep like it mattered more than anything else. No compromises, no excuses, sleep became non negotiable.

It was the hardest and most important thing I’ve ever done.

What I actually did

Set a non negotiable sleep schedule

I decided on 10:30pm to 6:30am. Eight hours, same time every night including weekends. No exceptions for social plans or late work nights or wanting to stay up watching something.

The consistency was critical. My body needed to learn when sleep time was. Going to bed at random times between midnight and 3am meant my circadian rhythm was constantly confused.

First week was brutal because I wasn’t tired at 10:30pm. I’d lie there awake feeling like I was wasting time. But I stayed in bed with the lights off anyway, training my body that this was sleep time now.

By week two my body started naturally getting tired around 10pm. By week three I was falling asleep within 15 minutes of lying down. The consistency trained my biology.

Banned screens an hour before bed

This was harder than it sounds. My entire evening routine had been scrolling my phone in bed until I passed out. That blue light was destroying my melatonin production and the content was keeping my brain activated when it needed to wind down.

At 9:30pm every night, phone goes on the charger in another room. Not just face down next to me, actually in a different room where I can’t reach for it.

That hour before bed I’d read, journal, talk to my girlfriend, stretch, take a shower, anything calm and screen free. It felt weird at first, almost boring. I didn’t know what to do with myself without a screen.

But that boredom was the point. My brain needed boring to transition into sleep mode. The constant stimulation had been keeping me wired.

Within two weeks my sleep quality improved dramatically just from cutting screens before bed. I’d fall asleep faster and sleep deeper.

Fixed my caffeine intake

I was drinking coffee all day, last cup usually around 5pm or 6pm, thinking it wasn’t affecting my sleep because I could still fall asleep eventually.

But caffeine has a half life of 6 hours. Coffee at 5pm meant half that caffeine was still in my system at 11pm. I was trying to sleep with stimulants in my bloodstream and wondering why my sleep was restless.

I cut myself off at noon. One or two cups in the morning, nothing after 12pm. The afternoon fatigue was rough for the first week but I pushed through with walks and cold water instead of more coffee.

After two weeks my energy levels stabilized. I wasn’t crashing in the afternoon anymore because I was actually sleeping properly at night.

Made my room actually dark and cool

My bedroom had light coming in from streetlights, my phone charging light, random electronics with LEDs, all creating this ambient glow. Even small amounts of light suppress melatonin and disrupt sleep cycles.

I got blackout curtains and covered every little light source. My room became completely dark, like can’t see your hand in front of your face dark.

I also dropped the temperature to 67 degrees. Your body temperature needs to drop to fall asleep and stay asleep. I’d been sleeping in a room that was too warm and wondering why I’d wake up throughout the night.

The combination of pitch black and cool made a massive difference. I started sleeping through the night instead of waking up multiple times.

Used a structured plan to fix everything at once

I was scrolling Reddit one night looking for sleep solutions and someone mentioned this app Reload that builds 60 day plans. I downloaded it thinking it’d just be sleep tips but it asked detailed questions about my routine and built a complete schedule.

Sleep was part of it but the plan also structured my entire day. Wake time, workout time, work blocks, wind down routine, everything scheduled so it all supported better sleep.

The app also had this ranking system that made progress feel like a game. Every day I completed my plan I’d move up ranks. It sounds silly but that gamification kept me motivated when I wanted to skip the routine and stay up late.

What surprised me was the plan included blocking during the day. It’d automatically block distracting sites during work hours so I’d actually be productive and not need to work late. That meant I could stick to my 10:30pm bedtime instead of working until midnight.

Having the entire day structured around supporting good sleep, not just the sleep itself, made it actually sustainable.

Started exercising in the morning

I used to work out at 8pm or 9pm when I had time, right before trying to wind down for bed. Terrible idea. Exercise spikes cortisol and adrenaline and body temperature, the opposite of what you need before sleep.

I started working out at 6:30am instead, right after waking up. It was miserable for the first two weeks dragging myself out of bed to exercise, but it had two huge benefits.

One, it reinforced my wake time. Even if I wanted to sleep in, I had to get up to work out. That consistency locked in my schedule.

Two, morning exercise made me naturally tired by evening. By 10pm I was ready for bed instead of wired and restless.

The morning workouts also gave me energy for the whole day. I wasn’t relying on caffeine to function, I had natural energy from actual rest and movement.

Week 1 and 2, I felt worse before better

The first two weeks were terrible. I was forcing myself to bed before I was tired, lying there awake feeling frustrated. I was cutting off caffeine early and feeling exhausted all afternoon. I was waking up early to exercise when my body wanted more sleep.

Everything in me wanted to quit and go back to my old routine. At least before I knew what to expect. This felt harder.

But I’d committed to 60 days and I trusted the process even though I felt worse.

By the end of week two something shifted. I started falling asleep faster. I started waking up feeling slightly less terrible. The pieces were starting to work.

Week 3 and 4, I started sleeping through the night

This was the breakthrough. For the first time in years I’d sleep from 10:30pm to 6:30am without waking up. No tossing and turning, no waking up at 3am with my mind racing, no restless half sleep.

Just solid, deep, uninterrupted sleep for eight hours.

I’d wake up and feel rested. Not perfect, not full of energy, but actually rested. I hadn’t felt that in so long I’d forgotten it was possible.

My mood started improving. I wasn’t as irritable. Small annoyances didn’t set me off. I had patience again.

My focus got sharper. I could read something once and retain it instead of rereading the same thing five times. Work that used to take me all day I was finishing in a few hours because my brain actually worked properly.

Week 5 and 6, everything started clicking

By week five I wasn’t just sleeping better, I was better. My anxiety had dropped significantly. That constant background dread was gone. My chest wasn’t tight, my thoughts weren’t racing, I felt calm.

I started losing weight without changing my diet. My body wasn’t in constant stress mode anymore so my metabolism started working normally.

My workouts got better. I had energy and strength I hadn’t had in years. I was lifting heavier, running faster, recovering quicker.

My relationship improved. My girlfriend said I was more present, more patient, more affectionate. I wasn’t snapping at her over small things or being withdrawn because I was too exhausted to engage.

Friends commented that I seemed different, more like myself. I was more social, more engaged in conversations, more fun to be around because I wasn’t constantly fighting fatigue.

Week 7 and 8, I felt like a different person

The last two weeks I finally understood what it felt like to be properly rested. I’d wake up before my alarm, naturally, feeling ready for the day. No grogginess, no hitting snooze, just awake and alert.

I had consistent energy all day. No afternoon crash, no fighting to keep my eyes open, just steady energy from morning to evening.

My productivity was higher than it’d ever been. I was getting more done in less time because my brain worked properly. My boss noticed and asked what changed. I told him I fixed my sleep and everything else fixed itself.

My anxiety was almost gone. I felt calm and grounded and capable of handling whatever came up. Problems that used to overwhelm me felt manageable.

I looked better. My skin cleared up, my eyes weren’t bloodshot and puffy, I’d lost 12 pounds, I looked healthy instead of exhausted.

Eight weeks earlier I’d been a zombie running on fumes. Now I felt alive.

What actually changed in 60 days

My brain started working again

Sleep deprivation had been making me stupid and I didn’t realize it. My memory, focus, decision making, creativity, all of it had been impaired.

Once I started sleeping properly my cognitive function came back. I could think clearly, solve problems, remember things, focus for hours. It was like someone turned my brain back on.

My mood stabilized completely

The irritability, the anxiety, the emotional instability, all of it was downstream from lack of sleep. Once I fixed my sleep my mood leveled out.

I wasn’t snapping at people. I wasn’t spiraling into anxiety. I wasn’t feeling depressed for no reason. I just felt steady and calm.

My physical health improved dramatically

The weight loss, the better workouts, the improved recovery, all connected to sleep. Your body repairs itself during sleep. When you don’t sleep enough, nothing works right.

Once I prioritized sleep my body started functioning the way it was supposed to. Hormones balanced, metabolism normalized, inflammation decreased, everything improved.

My productivity tripled

Proper sleep meant I could actually focus and think clearly. Work that used to take me all day because I was fighting through brain fog I could finish in two hours of sharp focused effort.

I got promoted six weeks into this because my performance improved so dramatically. My boss thought I’d figured out some productivity system. I just started sleeping.

My relationships got better

Being rested meant I had the emotional capacity to be present for people. I wasn’t too tired to engage, too irritable to be patient, too foggy to listen.

I showed up better for my girlfriend, my friends, my family. They all commented on the difference.

The truth about sleep

Sleep isn’t optional. It’s not something you can shortchange and make up for with coffee and willpower. It’s the foundation everything else is built on.

Every system in your body depends on sleep. Your brain, your immune system, your metabolism, your hormones, your mood, everything. When you don’t sleep, everything breaks.

You’re not more productive staying up late to work. You’re less productive the entire next day because your brain doesn’t work properly. The math doesn’t work out in your favor.

You can’t catch up on weekends. Sleep debt accumulates and sleeping in on Saturday doesn’t undo five nights of poor sleep.

The most productive thing you can do is sleep. Everything else in your life improves when you’re properly rested.

If sleep is destroying your life

Set a non negotiable sleep schedule. Same time every night, same time every morning, no exceptions. Your body needs consistency.

Cut screens an hour before bed. The blue light and stimulation are destroying your ability to fall asleep. Read, journal, do something calm instead.

Stop caffeine after noon. It stays in your system longer than you think and it’s disrupting your sleep even if you don’t realize it.

Make your room dark and cool. Blackout curtains, cover all light sources, drop the temperature to 67 or 68 degrees.

Find a system that structures your entire day around good sleep. I used Reload which built a complete 60 day plan that included sleep routine, daytime structure, blocking distractions during work so I wouldn’t need to work late, everything that supported actually going to bed on time.

Exercise in the morning. It reinforces your wake time and makes you naturally tired by evening.

Commit to 60 days minimum. The first two weeks feel harder, by week three you start feeling the benefits, by week eight you’re a different person.

Treat sleep like it’s the most important thing in your life because it is. Everything else depends on it.

Final thoughts

60 days ago I was surviving on broken sleep and wondering why everything felt impossible. I was irritable, anxious, unfocused, gaining weight, struggling through every day in a fog.

Now I sleep eight hours every night and everything else fixed itself. My mood is stable, my anxiety is gone, my focus is sharp, my energy is consistent, my productivity is higher than ever.

Two months of prioritizing sleep completely changed my life.

Stop treating sleep like it’s optional. Stop sacrificing it for work or social plans or screen time. Stop telling yourself you’ll catch up later.

Sleep is the foundation. Fix it first and everything else gets easier.

Set your schedule today. Tonight, go to bed at the same time. Tomorrow morning, wake up at the same time. Start the consistency now.

Find a system that structures your whole day to support good sleep, not just the sleep itself.

See what happens when you’re actually rested for the first time in years.

The version of you that sleeps properly is calmer, sharper, more capable, and more present than the exhausted version you’ve been living as.

In particular, the Yoco (and similar) machines that ask if you want to tip when you make a card payment. I'm already paying R40 for my flat white, so no I don't want to tip - just pay your staff what they deserve.

Look, I completely understand that I am privileged to be buying anything that would require a tip. But, its more the principle of putting this outright onus on you, as the customer, to sheepishly click ""no, I do not want to tip"" and the poor employee behind the counter having to see that you've just clicked that before making your coffee or whatever. 

I spent some time in Japan last year, and it felt like such a burden off ones back not ever having to think about tips. It's all in the price and staff are paid proper salaries. It's such a better way of doing it.

I've actually slowly started avoiding places that use these machines if I know about them and there is an alternative close by.

# Jan 10, 2025: Todd “I like You” Anderson

Troll

I’m working the counter with Mona. She’s doing her best to make me uncomfortable. Brushing up against me by “accident.” Flirting, just generally being evil as sex demons are. This is so a sexual harassment case. Not that I’d bring it up. She knows I’m engaged, so this is strictly her being a fiend. She would’ve made a great troll.

She pushes those boobs against my back as she passes me and I about lose it. “You’ll regret this teasing, friend.”

She does not miss a beat. “No, I won’t, buddy.”

Oh, it is on… “Oh yes you will, guy.”

She is smiling as she hits me with, “Don’t think so, friend.”

“We will see, buddy.”

“Whatever, guy.” And she walks away.

The regular in front of me just looks at both of us. “The reviews said the staff’s awesome. I see why.”

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Riley Henderson

Enlightened Little Human Badass

How’d I know it’d be a trailer park? We stop the car and I look. I see a boy playing with an old toy dump truck in front. I hear yelling. He flinches.

“We can leave whenever you want, sweetie.” Mom and dad are both worried but won’t take this from me.

I see a woman walk out. She’s holding her face. I start seeing red. A man comes out. I noticed my birth mom has a longer nose than me and it is thin. This man has my nose. Or, more accurately, I have his. This is my guardian momma’s ex. I get out of the car. While the woman cowers and he yells at her, I walk up calmly and call out. “Mike?”

“The fuck you want? Mind your own business… wait. Holy shit.”

I nod. “My birth mother told me you and she were childhood friends. I look familiar?”

“You’re Riley?” His face is pure shock.

“Yes, I came to give you a note and see you once. This is worse than I thought.” I turn to the lady who’s holding their son. “My Guardian momma told me she delivered me with 3 cracked ribs and a broken arm.”

He starts walking towards me. “Mind your own business you fucking…”

I hear dad behind me. When did he get there? I guess he’s scary enough as is, but I’m pretty sure if Mike even raises a hand towards me, dad will kill him. I love my dad.

“She left him after he put a knife through her arm trying to stab her face. She almost died.”

He growls. Dad gets in front of me. “Try me instead, I hit back.” Pure aura farming now. My father is an absolute Chad.

The man that should mean something to me spits at the ground and walks into the trailer after throwing my unopened letter in the dirt.

Dad looks at them. He goes to help the lady up. “You need to get out.”

“We don’t have anywhere to go.” She looks terrified.

“At the rate this man is going, you are going to be dead soon. I can’t, I won’t let that happen.”

She looks at him wide-eyed. “Please don’t.”

Dad shakes his head. “I won’t. But there’s a line forming. That little girl of mine isn’t lying about any of it. A lot of his ex-wife’s new family are only held at bay because no one knows where he lives, and she won’t give them a hint. I’m not so kind. I’ve been offered a lot of money to tell someone.”

The lady gets wide eyes. “He really did that to his ex?” Lady, you don’t believe it with the bruises I see on you?!

Dad unlocks his phone and shows her a picture he took of Pat with her sleeve up hugging me. She sees how much like guardian momma I look. The current wife sees the scar on her arm too.

Dad hands her something and whispers. She nods and thanks him. He then looks at me. “Ready to go, kiddo, or would you like to take the letter back?”

I shake my head. “No, he can abandon that too. It’s fine dad. Thanks for being amazing. You’re the GOAT. Just like mom.”

He winks at me. “I’m so very happy you believe that kiddo.”

We get in the car and start going. Mom asks dad. “What did you give her?”

“Part of my sign on bonus. The stuff left over from what I had thought would be needed for renting a place. Felt right. I also gave her a business card with my new work number. The agency and Campbell’s number are there too. I also gave her a card with a divorce lawyer. The same one Patricia used.” He chuckles at that. Kinda petty, not gonna lie… I love it. “I told her that it should be enough to run away with her child and start over or to buy insurance and that we’d be gone inside a week, but he probably has exactly one week and one day left so get that insurance fast.”

“DAD!”

“Sorry sweetie, your bio-donor is a monster, and I think I’m going to take a different monster up on her offer.”

Mom looks at him. “We never told you about Titania and Obie’s offer.”

Dad laughs. “No, the CEO of the private security firm I work for made me the offer. The one that put a commission out on a background for the man you just met two months ago. Right before buying my old firm after I gave her his info. That same CEO knew I was running a background check on her while I was doing it and then offered me a new position in New York with an incredible salary. She’s the same one that co-owns a company called The CaFae with Patricia and a silent partner named Titania. Her name is Maybelle. I’m pretty sure Titania is her sister…”

Mom and I both realize a lot of things at once. “What?!”

I add, “Dad, Titania mentioned Mab.”

“Yeah, that’s her. I figured it out when we met. I think my boss is the scariest fucking monster to ever live, queen of the fairy tale monsters. Oh, and she’s in love with Patricia…”

“WHAT?!?!”

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Desdemona

Demon (Incubus)

“It’s a good day to meet a good Queen. What delightful dish may I demonically dispense for your drinking de… ugh, that got away from me.”

Mab starts laughing. “Iced Passion tea, soy milk, vanilla syrup, and berries.”

I nod. “One purple drink, for the gorgeous lady!” She damn near giggles and I get her drink going.

As I hand it to her she looks at me. A card gets slipped into my hand. “I believe your talents are such that this may be a way to find something new and worthwhile. Do check on it.”

She smiles and goes to the back to talk to Ms. Wallace. Meanwhile Yuri comes to the counter. An angel served by an incubus at a coffee shop. I giggle at the insanity of this place. I love it here.

Now about this card. It is for a temp agency. Huh. Why would she suggest this? I mean, Yeah, I like working because sleeping is… best left minimal. Even with therapy the dreams that do show up are pretty horrible. Being what I am, 3 hours is usually all I need, if that.

I think I’ll call. Another gig or two won’t hurt.

The chime rings “Where Everybody Knows Your Name” and we all start a chorus, “Connie.” And she smiles and waves. That chime’s a stinker. She winks in answer to my smile. “Usual Green Tea, gorgeous?” A quick nod from her as she looks at Ms. Wallace’s office.

“Oh, Connie, I heard you and Ms. Wallace are officially dating…” it was obvious at board game night…

She laughs and smiles. “Yeah.”

I wink. “I’m not sure which of you I’m more jealous of.”

She goes beat red.

“You’re joking, my Lady’s way prettier.”

I stare at this dryad. A creature that is every bit as sexy as demons created from lust. “Connie, we’re going to have to talk about how to properly understand just how fucking gorgeous you are. You dress soft. If you dressed for sex appeal, the men here would be asking for dates daily, maybe hourly…”

She chuckles. “What about the women?”

I wink at her. “Of course. Connie, if you come into the shop in something form fitting, I’ll offer to take you out on the town, wine you, dine you, and make you find religion in my bed.”

I realize that I mean it. She’s name #2 on the Mayday list. We’ve been close since I started coming here. She was the first being to know my name and not call me “Mommy.” She’s been there for me even when I wasn’t sure of anything. Hell, she was there in the office waiting for us after I got summoned. She’s the one that grabbed my stuff and started the search for me, really. She’s always been there…

Ugh, I need to stop thinking this way. Dating is not something I can handle. And I want to wade in and not jump into the deep end. Which, considering relative feelings, might be someone like her.

She seems to think about something and nods at me. “Thank you for the compliment.” She heads to the restroom while leaving her tea with her selkie friend, Silk. I get some more customer served when I see her walk out of the restroom.

Scratch that. EVERYONE sees her come out of the restroom. Todd manages to croak out a “HOLY FUCK.” She is in THE BSG little red dress. Did she do this with glamour? I bet she looked up little red dresses and found the one in Battlestar… Wow, she looks every bit as good as Helfer did in that thing.

She walks up, and I realize what she just told me by her actions.

She looks at me shyly. “So…”

I don’t hesitate. I’d be an idiot to do so after getting such an obvious set up. “I’ll pick you up after my therapy session tomorrow, do you like Greek? You can only be away from your grove for up to five hours right?” I mean, there is no way I’m passing up this opportunity.

She nods, surprised.

“Yeah, we’ll have to swing by your grove or tree before I take you home, because I’ll need at least two hours to properly lick every square centimeter of you.”

She goes red. “Did it get warm in here?”

I nod. “Of course it did, you’re too fucking hot. 4 p.m.?”

She nods. “I can’t believe I couldn’t resist doing this…”

“Connie, if you don’t want me to live up to my word, you can always say no at any point, and I’ll back off. I do believe you are gorgeous and I’d love to show you how much I appreciate you.”

She winks at me. “4 pm.”

I have a date with a dryad. The planet may end…

I see Mab coming walking out of Ms. Wallace’s office. Why is she smiling like Carrot when he just caught the ominous red dot?

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Patricia Rae Wallace

Human and part-time ArchFae. Sure we’ll go with that

I get a text from super mom. It was the last puzzle piece.

That conniving, horrible, sneaky, wonderful, beautiful monster of a friend I don’t deserve was behind all of the family shit. And she did it to get two things done, I’m betting.

Mab walks into the CaFae less than 5 minutes after I get the text and I know immediately. Hmmmm.

She picks up her order from Mona and heads to my office. I didn’t even have to ask. She opens the door after a gentle knock and my “come in,” response.

“I believe we need to talk, Patricia.”

“About the werewolf issue, the Necromancer, or how you found my child and her parents, offered Matt a job in New York that would be stupid to refuse, and knowing he already had the info, made him a ridiculous offer for that information on Mike?”

“The latter.”

No denial, no need. She’s smiling. I can’t help but smile. “Go ahead, Queen of Air and Darkness.”

“You always use the full honorific when you’re annoyed. I know this was a bit presumptuous of me. However, I only put in a request with investigators in all the cities near military bases. I had your name, age, and general circumstances. I asked for information on you, your family, and your ex.”

“When.”

“In the last few months. It was a curiosity.”

“I know this is more and there’s more to it than that.”

“I don’t deny that.” She is a stone right now. I can’t read anything from her. Infuriating.

“How did you know where to look?”

“I will not disclose my accomplice. I will ask you to imagine my surprise when an investigator sent me a meticulously crafted file on Michael. After that I requested and got similar files on Heather, Ben, Patricia, and Riley.”

She knows my mom and dad’s name too?

I check my phone. The last text I sent her is still only delivered. She usually reads it by May.

“What did you do to my mother?”

“I assure you I have done nothing to her.”

“Who did?”

“No one. I have not shared this information. What has happened to her is of her own doing. I will point out my information was gathered in November.”

I can’t stop the flinch.

“Please explain the rest.”

“I requested information about you and more importantly of Michael. Within an hour I had it. I was impressed. The work was thorough. Far too thorough. This person had a personal interest or was a savant. He performed exemplary work. He obviously had done this research sometime in the past. So very detail oriented. So good that he knew I was performing this search without your assistance. He then dug around and found our business connection, or he already knew it. He also found how I had falsified my birth records.” She takes a drink.

“He was checking into me because he knew I was looking for Mike and you weren’t involved, Patricia. Remarkable initiative. His instinct was to try and protect you from me.”

She shrugs and drops a bomb on me, “I bought his company and told him to check me fully.”

My annoyance has to be on my face. She nods.

“Imagine my surprise when I get a picture of myself along with several of me coming to this establishment and my home. A meticulously crafted background evaluation of myself. He noted discrepancies I had not.”

I get a sudden pang of fear.

“Do not worry, I would never reward someone that helped me get rid of discrepancies with my mortal guise with anything less than a reward. He is a very good asset. It was more effective than buying him off in some other manner. Now I have more assets and can expand my influence along the coast. A small win. He performs very admirably. That test I gave him proved it. I had my company extend an offer for a transfer.”

Yeah. She knew what she was doing. She learned long ago the carrot works better than the stick.

“Explains why he wasn’t freaked out finding out about the Fae…”

“Patricia, I surround myself with extraordinary talent. You especially. He is well within the normal group I would hire.”

“What’d you offer for Mike’s information?”

She smiles. “A lady never tells.”

I laugh. “Don’t bullshit me, my lady, he’s as devoted as they come. Aside from the random thought about Jackie while staring at her, he’s super devoted. I can’t blame him there. He’s also way more vanilla than I was. He isn’t cheating on her. What did you offer him?”

She winks. “It was monetary. A substantial sum for the work he did. I do not need to use supernatural methods to compensate most mortals. I told him I would be the only person with Mike’s information. Which is still true. Adding the new location and pay, he has a much better financial situation, and his daughter will have a better education. Now then, I will accept your decision on his handling, and I will bless his daughter and any future child with a happy life. All within my ability.”

“So why do this?”

She comes over and touches my cheek. “Because of all the mortals I love, you are the only one who has held me accountable. You are the one that’s loved me the most. Even in this moment you are forcing me to show restraint and treating me as a… friend you are angry with. I apologize if that is a presumptive description of your attitude towards me.”

I sigh, “It’s not. Mab, you’re someone that’s given me so much and asked for so little it sometimes feels unfair to call you anything BUT a friend, at the very least. I do care for you greatly, my friend.”

Hold on, what is going on… Is that a tear. It is. Fuck me. She teared up?

“Yes well, thank you. I would do much for you Patricia, even though we are not ‘in love’ as you and your wonderful consort are, we do truly love one another.”

I nod. It isn’t wrong. *I’d punch Thanatos in the face for her just as readily as I would have for Jackie.*

I don’t care that I broadcast that to her. I know she heard it. I wink at her and she nods and a smile reaches her eyes. “Alas, you will never have the chance, he will not come for me.”

She tries to change the subject, “While we are in the subject of those you love, do be a dear and make sure Mona has mornings available over the next few weeks.”

“I’ll let Lemar know.” I end that diversion.

She looks puzzled. “You are not going to ask why?”

“I wouldn’t ruin the surprise. Back on task, why do you keep doing these things? And what do you plan to do with Mike’s information?”

“I want you to be as happy, as you make me, dear Patricia. As for the Mike question, please advise me on what should we do to a man that has a second child who has been to the hospital for ‘falls’ four times in five Years and a wife that walks with a limp due to a poorly set leg break?”

All I see is red.

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Nixie

Pixie

“I’m NOT getting you another.” I place the packet on the table in front of Warrior at the CaFae. He looks so very annoyed. I guess Puck used his last one to pull a prank on the werewolves. Puck, always managing to maximize pranks…

Yuri walks by us and looks at him as if seeing a long lost friend. “Laoch?” My embarrassed client looks up and smiles. He stands up and they bump into one another as Yuri’s a fucking klutz. I watch in slow motion as the coffee cup Yuri is holding goes end over end and lands, lid askew, on the packet, spilling the remaining 10 or so ounces of fluid on the papers.

“Did you piss off some god we don’t know about?” I ask Laoch.

He just sighs.

Poor guy. Ugh. This goes against my very nature. I look at him, “Fine, I’ll get you another…”

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Grace Brown

Enlightened Human

I open the door to the CaFae and my son Joshua and his friend Will. I hear two enlightened and a regular. Huh? Josh doesn’t know about the things here. Or has he figured it out? Wait, Will came in right after me, not Josh.

I walk up to the counter and they are here. They are a woman right now. “Good morning Grace.” They won’t look me in the eyes. Ugh. I wish this wonderful creature would realize I am not mad.

I put on my best smile. “Hey Pat. I brought my son, you’ve met Josh before. I’ll take my blonde Mocha.

I pay and we wait while Pat and Henry get things going. Dis is at the drive thru? Who’s the shift manager? I see Paul walk up. I wave him in. “Why Dis drive thru?” He looks at me as if I’m not sane. “She doesn’t mind.”

“Paul, she makes EVERYONE better tips at the counter and sales go up.”

He looks confused. “Really? We got numbers for that?”

I nod and point to Patricia’s office. “There’s a chart that has a tip index and sales trends on the inside of the door. Lemar and Patricia put it together. Go look. I know Lemar mentioned it.”

He walks back and Pat is talking with Will. He nods and takes out his phone. Are they exchanging numbers? That worked better than I thought…

Will walks up and Josh is trying not to crack up. “That’s mom’s boyfriend.”

Will looks at Josh funny. “No she isn’t. She and your mom broke up earlier this week. And she is stupid cute. Good job getting that one, Mrs. B.”

Josh looks at me and I nod. “Will, Pat prefers they, do try to use it for them.” He nods. “So, Josh, I need to tell you something…”

Will just cuts me off, “Your mom was dating a Mermaid. They can change to guys.”

Josh takes it okay. My kid’s resilient. “That explains a lot. Weird things make a bit more sense. And their use of they. I thought they are just nonbinary. Well, I guess they still are. It also… they are a mermaid right now, but have always been a guy when with you. You know, they are super cute as a gal…”

I give my kid a death stare. “Josh, we broke up because they want to give birth to a child and couldn’t until fate intervened. I am NOT going to be the mom-in-law of my ex…”

Josh laughs. “Maybe if you weren’t dating people my age you could protest, mom…”

My cheeks get bright red. I brought up my kids to be smart and independent. It’s biting my ass…

Will decides to save me. “Dude, have you SEEN your mom? Like, look at her from the viewpoint of any guy but you. Dear lord, she’s probably the cause of an acre or two of deforestation for tissue paper when we were in high school …I know I helped.”

“JESUS WILL!!!” Josh is mortified. He’s not the only one. There went any chance of my cheeks not burning for a bit.

“Anyway, I saw the signs of them being a mermaid and made a joke about this place hiring a real one. We hit it off and I am so gonna ask her… them out. I’ll get better at that.”

I look at Will. “So, when did you find out about the fairy tales being real?”

He laughs. “I was six. The monster under my bed was chatty. I started seeing all sorts of them after that. Almost thought you were one for a while in high school. Nymph or something. Deforestation and all…”

I shake my head, it figures. Also, I may kill him.

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Mona, ArchDemon of Lust

Demon

I thought my day was perfect. I feel the air stir and a chill goes up my spine. Oh fuck. Only two creatures can do this to me. I see a Lamia in her human guise walk in with her mother. I should be more exact. All Lamia call Lilith, First of the Corrupted, their mother. She birthed the race.

And she is right there, staring at me with those insanely gorgeous Yellow-green eyes. I feel her magic hit me like a semi-truck. My terror gets squashed. Oh. Well crap, Ms. Wallace’s blessing works on terror too? Good to know.

She saunters up and stares at me directly. “Desdemona, it’s been hundreds of years. Still powerful, I see, but you have changed.”

I smile. “Welcome, what would you like to drink? I am happy to serve you.” I am going to annoy the fuck out of her. I can feel my tattoo pulsing as it feeds off the anger she feels within moments from my words.

“You are an Incubus. You don’t serve anyone, except, perhaps, me.” She sneers at me. I am seriously considering how to get away when Dis walks up.

Dis looks at her and gets a considering look. “Madam, there are other patrons behind you, please order or kindly get the fuck out.” My head nearly gets whiplash as it spins to stare at the Dark Elf. These two have a history?

“Stay out of this, DisLirien. Unless you wish to have another object lesson on who’s magic is more effective.” These two definitely have a history.

The Dark Elf laughs. “My bet is on Patricia’s. Look at yourself and all of us. See the attachment.”

Lilith’s eyes glow faintly and she looks around. I know what she is seeing. The Domain has a quirk where the moment you step in, it claims you as hers. It will protect you as long as you are in. At least to a certain degree. It can’t stop your attacker, they will suffer once they hurt you. It has gotten much more… aggressive since Ms. Wallace nearly died. I don’t think I have seen a single fight last more than one punch. Of course, that punch can kill in this case.

“A Sidhe Queen. Hmmm. And the attachment to you is…formidable.”

What does she mean? I let my senses expand. HOLY FUCKBALLS. The Domain is caressing me as if I was… I am hers. Compared to everyone else here it is orders of magnitude stronger in how it embraces me. Shit. Whelmed.

“My Queen is very good to me. What would you like to drink?”

Her eyes narrow. “Iced Cherry Chai Latte.”

I nod and take the order. “One Iced Cherry Chai Latte for Lilith.” My hands are still a little shaky.

Dis looks at me. “I got it. I will even be nice and not spit in it.” Yeah, these two definitely have a bad history…

I look at the Lamia with her. “Miss?”

She looks very upset at the proceedings. “Please, I didn’t know that Mother would cause problems. I don’t want to be denied service here in the future.”

This poor thing. I put my hand on hers. “You don’t have to worry about that. She won’t be denied either as long as she obeys the major rules. Customers can be a challenge and we’re fine with that. You’ve no reason to believe her actions will cause you harm either. Okay, sweetie?”

She nods and seems to settle down. I see Lillith staring at me from the corner of my vision. I can’t let that fluster me. “Now then, what would the pretty Lamia like to order today?”

“Iced Lavender Cream Oatmilk Matcha.” She seems to be doing better. She gets some courage. “Call for Laika.”

I nod. I have it punched up and she gets a card out. Of course she pays for Lilith too. *Lilith you fucking freeloader.*

Dis immediately starts laughing. Oh fuck, I broadcast that. Some of the Fae in the room have turned and are smiling.

Dis calls “Iced Cherry Chai Latte for the freeloader,” and hands the glaring ArchDemon the drink and I hand Laika hers. When I do so, I hold her hand. “You are fine here, okay, honey?” She nods.

Lilith and she go and talk and drink while we continue getting our patrons helped. I notice they are still there when it is time for me and Dis to clock out. In the room as we are getting out of our aprons I look at Dis. “First, thanks. And second, you gonna be okay?”

She nods. “She and I have a…thing. She won’t attack me unless it’s a formal duel. I think the score is three to three and we last fought in the 80s.” I’m familiar with such a rivalry, though my rival is a petite ArchMage that’s in love with me. Dis chuckles, “She’ll behave. You, I’m worried about.”

I shrug. “Once upon a time I might have been able to have a chance in a fight with her. Now? Probably not. I’ll run if I need to.”

As we’re leaving Lilith gets up and motions for me to go to their booth. I head over. Better this than an assault outside.

“I heard rumors you’d changed. This is significant.” She seems more curious than mad.

I shrug. “We grow. I’m seeing what works for me.”

Her smile is both beautiful and terrifying. “Keep doing it. I wonder if things will work out. I’m hoping they do. If not, I hope I can be around for the entertaining way they fail.”

“Thanks?”

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Patricia Wallace

Human Fae hybrid

I’m slightly in shock, “Hold up. Mona told you that you dress ‘soft’ and said if you wore something form fitting you’d be getting men hitting on you constantly?”

Connie smiles at me and nods. “I asked what about women.”

I laugh. “Knowing Mona and that crush she has, she hit on you.”

Connie goes red. “She said if I wore something like that she would offer to ‘wine me, dine me, and help me find religion in her bed,’ and she looked so cute.”

I laugh for a good 15 seconds. “Planning on going in wearing something like that? It’ll absolutely work.”

She gets a grin similar to Carrot when he catches a mouse. She concentrates for a second and is now in the BSG red dress. Wow, is it warm in here? The dress almost appears painted on. Bob damn she is making concentrating hard with that thing on. Mona was absolutely right about her in something form fitting.

“I came out of the restroom in this.” She smiles at me.

I whistle. “When’s the date?” I wink at her.

“Tomorrow evening.” She’s not joking.

Holy shit. Wow. I… well. Damn. Um… *SHE IS MINE.* Knock it off Devil voice, I totally get why, but no. Well, that was an emotional roller coaster I wasn’t expecting in 5 seconds flat.

“My lady, are you okay? I heard that voice again.”

I nod. “You are the second name on the mayday list. She is totally fine dating you.”

“Why do you look so sad then?”

I do? She looks up at me with such loving eyes and I’m feeling like a monster because I’m still trying to sneak a look at her in her dress.

“I’m not sure. Maybe worried I’ll lose you?” We just got this started. I mean, we were talking about it a couple of days ago, but damn you both move fast” If anyone could steal Connie from me it’d be Mona. And is this jealousy or maybe envy of Connie too? Yeah, it is. Crap. I guess I do have something to talk to the Doc about along with Mab…

She shakes her head so hard she almost loses her balance. “Never. You’ll always be the highest regard of my heart. You will never leave it. Ever. That voice was correct, if terrifying. I care about Mona, but this is just a date and some fun. I don’t intend to dive into the deep end.”

I kiss her cheek. “That may change and it is fine if it does. Just make some room for all of us in there. If anyone deserves happiness, it’s the two of you.”

I get a kiss on my cheek. “You are not worried about losing her to me?” She is teasing me. The smile proves it.

“Maybe. I do want that omurice.”

“What?”

“Don’t worry about it, love. And for some reason I am not that worried about it. It is like with Jackie but not being too thick to get it. Or with you…”

“Your harem grows…” She grabs me and hugs me close.

“I just wanted a boyfriend that is good to me. And now I am dating a bunch of women and the only guy in my life is an ex that is married to one of those women that we do sort of dates with and this is a fucking mess.”

She laughs and kisses my cheek. “First worlder problems.” Holy shit the pun level of that statement… “remind me to spank you for that pun.”

She giggles. “I might like that.”

Yeah. I’m fucking doomed.

 

# Jan 10, 2025: Dis

Dark Elf

I sense them before they are visible. Lilith send them? No. Not demons. Six of them. They have me surrounded as I’m almost to the Apartments. How shall I deal with this? I’m in a charitable mood. I motion a spell into existence and whisper. All of them can hear me clearly. “I am DisLirien Ithilwen. You six have a choice. Leave in peace, or violence. You will not like the second option.”

Most choose violence. Ah, such single-mindedness would be commendable if it wasn’t so annoying. I need to pee. The first one steps out in front of me. I smile. It’s the last thing he sees tonight. Literally.

I wrap his face in shadows and he starts choking and having issue breathing. If he remains calm and thinks clearly, he’ll have no problems. He starts flailing. I can’t help the giggle.

The three behind me rush forward. Their world goes black. I let the darkness suffocate them and they panic. I really wish these mortals would stop messing with me. The last two are interesting. I see one stalking me from a distance. This one is smart. They are using their sense of smell. They seem to not want to fight, just are shadowing me. I start walking forward. This one maintains their distance. Fine by me. I get to the property line and release the spells. Two of them have gone unconscious. They’ll be fine. That one that had been shadowing me moves to help their friends. Ah, they were just making sure I would let the idiots go.

The last werewolf is a large wolf that has cut me off. It stops. It then waits. I sigh. “Do we really need to fight?” I am so not in the mood. I have worked most of the day and just want to get home, pee, change into something comfortable, and then put my feet up and watch cat videos and eat dinner.

The wolf shifts. It is a pretty woman. Short cropped brunette, athletic build, kind eyes. She walks over to the steps in front of the apartment buildings and sits down. “Hey there!”

I realize I know this person. She is often at the CaFae. She flirts with me almost as much as she does with Aaron. She smiles as she asks, “Hey can I ask you a strange question?”

I sigh. “Yes, but can we move this to my apartment, I really feel gross right now.” I get to the door without a single hint of bloodlust from her. She gets up and follows me. John smiles and waves at me. He stares at the nonchalant nude werewolf. Can’t blame him, it’s a nice show. We go up the elevator and get to my room. I open the door and let her in. She nods and smiles as I put a few things up and she stands by the sofa. “Have a seat if you like.”

“Didn’t want my nude butt on your couch if you had issues with it. Thanks. Nice place.” She is still looking at things and I am not sure what to make of this creature.

“I am going to take a shower. There are some snacks in the fridge. Please leave the Salad, that’s my dinner. Be right back.”

I do my business, finish my shower and walk out. I’m toweling off when I get to the living room area and she whistles. “Warn a girl!”

I laugh. “You’re literally nude and have been for a while in front of me.” I see my salad has been placed in a bowl and dressing is sitting next to it and the place is set for me. My opinion of her is now hitting “friend material.”

“Difference is I’m a six on a good day. You’re an 11.”

Sometimes I wish I had whites to my eyes so mortals could see me rolling them at them. This is such a moment. “You’re an eight plus on a bad day. What did you wish to ask me?” She seems to brighten up at the compliment.

“I wanna know about someone that works at the CaFae. What do you know and think about a gal named Jen…?”

My husband (27m) and I (25f) have been together for 8 years, but have been having some problems the lately. It all started two days ago when we went to wash my car and I found some pink wrapping paper I didn't recognize. I asked him about it and he said his friend bought it since Christmas for his girlfriend's gift, he had already told me about it but not that he had left the trash there, I told him that and he got a little defensive, so after throwing it away I told him ""it's not that I don't trust you, I just find it weird you let your friends leave trash in my car"" that's when he really got defensive saying I was being dramatic and that I was just ""chingando"" (which is a very ugly Spanish word that means someone is bothering you) I told him it was just a simple petition and tried very hard to keep my cool and not elevate my voice even though I was already being yelled at. After this we went to the DMV to take a driving test so I could take a restriction off my license, I was already kinda nervous because tests make me nervous., he noticed this since he had gotten home before the carwash and I explained it to him but now I know he took my feelings towards the test personally for some reason. When we got to the DMV an hour early he just parked the car and left to a nearby restraunt, I felt very overwhelmed and I just started crying, After the test we went back home but didn't talk at all, when we arrived I grabbed the laundry, asked him to take care of the chicken that was boiling on the stove and left for the Laundromat. When I got home he was asleep on the couch. I went to the kitchen to check the chicken, the stove was still on and all the water had evaporated off the pot leaving just the chicken that was starting to burn. I woke him up and asked him if he had been taking care of the chicken like I asked him to and he said he didn't even know, it was the only thing I had told him before leaving, how couldn't he have known? I don't understand I told him right to his face I know he heard me. This pissed me off very much but I decided to continue my duties and went to fold the laundry and make dinner. When I finished dinner I tried to wake him up again but just got a half asleep growl. I ate dinner alone, packed his lunch and went to sleep. He stayed on the couch. The next day I woke up at 4am with him to make his coffee and give him his lunch, he barely acknowledged me. We didn't text or talk at all the rest of the day. I made food for when he got off work but I didn't fix him a plate and just told him the food was there for when he wanted to eat, no response. He ate then left, when he came back in the evening he brought me a chocolate which made me think he was trying to make amends and I accepted it, but he just showered and went to sleep, still no word. With his coldness from the past few days, the chocolate felt like a kind gesture so I decided to pack his lunch with a little extra love and went to sleep by his side. This morning he started hugging me and cuddling me and it felt so nice untill he turned me around and tried to get my panties down, I made some noise signaling I was uncomfortable and pulled them back up, this cause him to turn the other way, I thought maybe he wanted me to hug him but he'd start moving around and annoyingly growling every time I'd put my arm around him. He decided to get up before his alarm and started getting ready, I got up to go make his coffee. As he left I tried to give him his lunch and coffee but he would take it, I insisted and told him that he couldn't do a 10hr shift on an empty stomach, only then he took it and left. This left me with a horrible feeling and the tears I had been fighting off since yesterday came back. I texted him asking why he hugged me and made me feel so warm and loved then treated me the way he did, he said he was asleep, that he only hugged me because he was cold and unconscious. I told him I didn't deserve this treatment, he said he hadn't done anything that he was just treating me the same way I was treating him, which was definitely not true, he was just working and sleeping u was taking care of our well-being and caring for us. I couldn't believe what he was telling me, he started victimizing himself saying ""how was I supposed to act after the way you treated me"" saying that I didn't even know what the problem was, the worst came when he said the problem was that i didnt initiate sex with him, he said that the way he calms down but the audacity to say that after how he treated me for the past couple of days left me speechless, all I could say was ""how am I supposed to give you my body with the treatment I've been receiving"" he said ""well your body is supposed to be mine I've always told you that I need to get my testosterone out and now it feels like you think that I just see you as an object, that's just how it feels"" I insisted that it was ridiculous to ask that of me after everything that's happened but thats it. He's working now and I won't see him till maybe 3 in the afternoon. I don't know what to do anymore, we've been married for 8 years now, I don't think things should be like this at this point. I just keep telling myself it could be worst.",1,1767966470.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

1q88mzt,https://i.redd.it/zu8hrmkpubcg1.png,A rough sketch of my original sangheili tribe. Explanation in the post body,"The Kheal’th’ee are tribal sangheili communities that inhabit some parts of Sanghelios, sangheili and mixed colonies.

During the Covenant, Kheal’th’ee who inhabited Sanghelios kept their beliefs in secret, though for biggest part, nobody really cared enough to ensure religious loyalty to little isolated communities. The climates they lived in weren’t friendly either – they live in hot, smoky ashlands. They played along pretty well and \*did not\* publicly condemn The Great Journey’s believes. Kheal’th’ee who inhabited outer colonies, both mixed and sangheili, had more freedom of expression, though still remained isolated.

The Kheal’th’ee live in the ashlands not far from volcanos, growing crops and raising cattle. Evolutionarily, their bodies have adapted to the heat. They are best known for forging swords, weapons, and armor using iron melted with unique local minerals and hardened in raw lava. They prefer a quiet life; their societies are non-confrontational and are often compared to monks by humans.

Their tribes are matriarchal, as they believe that men in power tend to cause chaos and war. They speak their own ancient Sangheili dialect and are taught to smith, wield and forge blades from childhood.

A long time ago, duties in these tribes were split by gender: women hunted and men traveled to discover new lands. These men wore layers of clothing to protect their mouths and eyes from the ash and unpredictable climate changes outside of their local inhabitance; under matriarchal influence, this became a part of male fashion - to the point males wouldn't uncover their faces to anyone except their wives, their kids and other males. As for females hunting, it was believed that only a woman could take a life from an animal, that it would make meat ‘pure for consumption’, though such traditions are no longer followed.

The Kheal’th’ee men aren't much talkative, their wives would do most of the talking when it comes to inter-tribal communications or speaking to foreigners. Males and females both wear layers of clothing as a part of their fashion, though males are more likely to cover their faces daily while females do it only on bad weathers. They very much focus on smithing, forging, making spices and brewing 'sangheili' coffee, which is like a normal one, but more herb-y.

I'm starting out my coffee journey, recently purchased a french press.  
And tried brewing with pre grounded coffee, it tasted below average.

So after researching a lot, I got to know few things

1. The pre grounded coffee that I used was not of a good quality
2. Freshly grounded coffee tastes way better than pre grounded coffee

Then I thought of buying a good grinder, but looking at the prices of Timemore C2s, C3s I got the reality check that I cannot afford a stainless steel grinder for now.

So should I buy Agaro's Ceramic Manual Grinder

or

Buy good pre grounded coffee that has been grinded according to a french press

I'm pretty much confused and cannot decide what to choose.

Which is better for a french press

Good pre grounded coffee that has been grinded according to french press

or

Buying a ceramic grinder and grinding coffee beans.

1q88eev,https://i.redd.it/b888j682tbcg1.jpeg,Life has a peculiar talent for righting itself when given enough time...,"Good morning!  Have you ever had one of those days where everything just seems to go wrong? Not always catastrophically wrong— sometimes it's just enough that you suspect the universe may have misplaced its instruction manual. Then that day may turn into a string of days. And before you know it, you’re eyeing the calendar suspiciously and wondering if you accidentally subscribed to The Bad Day Extended Edition: A Bad Year, complete with bonus content.

If you're lucky, it's merely the kind of stretch where you miss your mouth while drinking coffee and baptize your shirt instead, emails require three rereads to make sense, and even your pets seem to be judging you. Nothing dramatic, no thunderclaps or operatic tragedy—just a steady drip of small frustrations that pile up until you find yourself sighing at inanimate objects. 

There are times when life is even less kind, but here’s the thing—bad days, bad weeks, even bad years have a shelf life. They always do. They pass quietly when you’re not looking, slipping out the back door while you’re distracted by something small and unexpectedly good: a laugh, a kind word, a moment of calm, or the sudden realization that today feels… lighter.

Life has a peculiar talent for righting itself when given enough time. The knots loosen. The clouds thin. The ground steadies beneath your feet. And one morning you wake up and realize the tide has turned—not with fanfare, but with relief.

So, if today feels heavy, take heart. You’re not stuck here. This chapter isn’t the whole story—and the next one has a much better plot.

When I addressed my discomfort I just pointed that he was online and ignoring me (he was obviously drunk and he cheated through text) and instead of just explaining whatever he was doing he suddenly started to scream at me, call me names, call my mom names (he hates her and I’m staying with her for a few days) and to smash the walls and the wardrobe. It has already happened before and once in person when I discovered that he kept on lying about drinking and chasing women, he kept on punching the sideboard I had just got him and screaming at me to give him his phone back.

I know for a fact that he broke a mirror while living with his ex, we’re yet to have a coffee and talk about our shared experience, but hadn’t touched her.

He’s lost all control, he’s stalking my social media and harassing every man that talks to me, I’m sure he’s been drinking nonstop and it seems that the only time he leaves me alone is when he’s with friends at the bar or some women.",2,1767965564.0,abusiverelationships,2,1.0,False

At the same time, plenty of people feel fine just having coffee, toast, or something light in the morning. So I’m curious what your take is.



Why do you think protein at breakfast matters (or doesn’t)?

1q888p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_romyjurado/comments/1q888p1/e2_visa_how_to_choose_the_right_business_for_your/,E-2 Visa: How to Choose the Right Business for Your Application,"The E-2 Visa is one of the most attractive options for foreign investors who wish to establish themselves in the United States. However, the success of your application does not depend solely on your investment but also on choosing the right business. This factor is decisive not only for convincing immigration officers but also for ensuring that your investment prospers in the long run.

In this article, we will explain the key aspects you must consider before choosing a business for your E-2 Visa application, the most favorable industries, and the common mistakes you should avoid.

# The Business Must Be Real and Operational

U.S. immigration law is clear: having an idea is not enough. The business you present must be active, real, and operational, or have a solid plan for immediate startup. This means speculative, passive businesses or those that only generate income without participation (for example, real estate for personal use or purely financial investments) do not qualify.

The officer reviewing your case must see evidence that your business:

* Has real commercial activity.
* Generates (or will generate in the short term) jobs and economic impact.
* Is designed to grow and not just to support you and your family.

# Financial Viability of the Business

Not every business with an initial investment will be sufficient. One of the E-2 Visa requirements is to demonstrate that the company will be viable and profitable. Therefore, before choosing, you should analyze:

* **Market demand:** Is there a real market for what you offer?
* **Projected profitability:** When and how will the business generate sufficient income?
* **Capacity for expansion:** A business with growth potential is much more attractive to immigration officers.

# Sectors That Are Often Favorable for the E-2 Visa

Although the E-2 Visa does not restrict the type of industry, some sectors have proven to be more stable and attractive:

* Restaurants and coffee shops: High local economic impact and job creation.
* Professional services businesses (consulting, technology, digital marketing).
* Franchises: Offer proven business models, providing security to the investor and confidence to immigration.
* Health and wellness: Clinics, spas, or gyms.
* Education and childcare: High demand in many communities.

Choosing a growing sector with good demand is one of the best strategies.

# Considering Your Experience and Skills

Although the law does not require prior experience in the chosen business, your professional background can make a difference. An investor with industry experience will have more credibility with immigration and greater chances of business success.

For example, if you have worked in the food industry, opening a restaurant under the E-2 Visa may be an excellent option. This not only strengthens your case but also allows you to perform better in the day-to-day operations of your company.

# The Importance of a Solid Business Plan

The business plan is one of the most important parts of your E-2 Visa application. Through this document, you will demonstrate to immigration that your project has a solid foundation and that your investment is substantial.

Your business plan should include:

* Detailed financial projections (3 to 5 years).
* Marketing strategies.
* Job creation in the U.S.
* Evidence of viability in the chosen market.

A well-structured business plan not only improves your chances of approval but will also be your roadmap to achieving business success.

# Common Mistakes When Choosing a Business for the E-2 Visa

Many investors make mistakes that can cost them their E-2 Visa approval. Some of the most frequent are:

* Choosing passive businesses (real estate for personal rental).
* Investing in businesses with little or no demand.
* Failing to conduct prior market research.
* Underestimating the capital required for the business to operate.

Avoiding these mistakes is crucial so your application is not denied and your investment is not compromised.

# Final Thoughts

Choosing the right business for your E-2 Visa application is not just a matter of personal preference but a strategic decision that directly impacts your chances of success. You must ensure that your project is real, viable, capable of generating jobs, and supported by a solid market.

This album felt less like listening to music and more like being quietly walked through my own memories, grief, love, and longing. It cracked me open in a slow, intentional way, equal parts comfort and ache. The songwriting is devastatingly intimate, full of running, returning home, loving hard, losing harder, and learning how to sit with the in-between. So many songs blurred the line between his stories and mine that I had to pause, breathe, cry, make coffee, unblock my past, and keep going. It’s tender, nostalgic, heavy, hopeful, and painfully beautiful all at once. Zach Bryan remains a lyrical genius, and this album feels like proof that loving deeply, even when it hurts, is still worth it. Heaven on top, heartbreak underneath, and me somewhere in the middle feeling everything.

My copper cezve obviously doesn't work on the magnets. I tried those induction interface disks (the converter plates), but they are super slow and honestly just annoying to deal with. I also tried a stainless steel pot, but it heats up way too aggressively and scorches the coffee before the foam can even rise.

I try to keep my kitchen minimal so I really didn't want to buy a ""single-use gadget,"" but after a week of caffeine withdrawal, I caved and looked for an electric option.

I ended up grabbing the Saki coffee maker, mainly because it claimed to have a sensor for the foam (and honestly, it looked the least like a cheap plastic appliance on my counter).

I hate to admit it, but the consistency is actually better than my manual attempts on the old stove. It stops right before boiling over, which was always my issue.

I wanted to share something real

A few months ago two of us started working on a small homegrown fragrance brand because we could not find skin friendly honest body mists that actually lasted Most options we tried were either too alcohol heavy or felt rushed

So we built House of TBH

Our mists are aloe based use only the necessary 20 percent alcohol and are made to be used on both skin and hair They are soft not sharp and meant for everyday wear Longevity is around 2 to 3 hours and we are very transparent about that

All our mists come in glass bottles and our 100ml size is priced at just 399 because we wanted to keep it accessible without cutting corners on quality

We also create inspired perfume dupes with around 20 to 30 percent oil concentration for people who want stronger performance at reasonable prices

Over the last month we have received more than 10 orders directly after posting on Reddit and that support genuinely meant a lot to us

Current fragrances we have built

Dark Roast coffee and chocolate cozy and deep

Tender Vanilla vanilla and coconut soft and comforting

Blue Meadows fresh airy everyday clean

Coral Reefs citrusy and bright

Tropical Rush orange forward energetic

We are still learning improving and building slowly If you enjoy trying indie brands or simply want to share honest feedback I would genuinely love to hear your thoughts

I recently had an accident , so I’m stuck indoors and it’s snowing outside, which probably doesn’t help the mood, but that’s not really what this post is about. What I’m really struggling with is figuring out how to move forward after graduation, because I genuinely want to stay in Norway, but the job search has been quietly discouraging. I’ve been applying for graduate and entry-level roles for around a year now, and it often feels like many positions are filled internally or through existing connections, which makes it hard as a new graduate coming from the outside. For context , I’ve been here about 1.5 years, and learned Norwegian up to A2-B1 level.Lately I keep seeing advice online about coffee chats, networking, and eventually asking for recommendations(from US based career influencers), and that’s where I feel unsure. Norway feels culturally different, more reserved and less direct about these things, so I don’t know what’s acceptable. Is it okay to message someone in a Norwegian company for a in person short coffee chat? How do people here view it when someone asks for recommendations after chat, or is that too awkward? I’ll be honest, I am trying to build connections and ask for small favors where it makes sense, because it feels like small chances can sometimes lead to real opportunities, but I don’t want to cross cultural lines or come across the wrong way. I’ve seen some international folks succeed through recommendations, and it often looks like a mix of timing, trust, and luck. I’d really appreciate honest experiences or advice on how networking and referrals actually work in Norway, especially for international students and new graduates, and if you have any general career advice you wish you’d known earlier, I’d be very grateful. Thanks for reading.

Edit: I mean asking recommendations from a company personnel.For a future or ongoing post they might have open in their company.",6,1767965034.0,Norway,4,1.0,False

We met the first week of September 2025. We instantly clicked like you know those type of people you can just easily vibe with? And then for about 2 weeks he started to verbalize he’s interested to get to know me and to possibly be his girlfriend. I’m really a cautious person because I don’t trust easily. Let’s just say based on what I have observed, during the get to know phase he is all good like giving me money for coffee or sending me food. I did see he is very expressive about his feelings. However sometimes i feel like he lacks effort. I’m not materialistic but it’s just that there are some occasions where I feel like he could send me at least a flower or anything at all but there’s none. Like where’s the guy that used to be like that? It’s like ever since I said yes to him on December he became complacent although he is still sweet and expressive. He’s going to visit Ph next year. We had one ex and also used to have talking stages. I am NBSB although have previous talking stages as well. Is it too early that I said yes to be his girlfriend or i should not depend in the timeline or months too much?


Also, ever since I made it official, he always wants us to do SOP. I understand it’s the only 
way and a form of intimacy as well since we are in an LDR setup. But it’s too frequent. Even if I’m not in the mood but he is always up for it. It’s really hard for me cause even if i dress a bit provocative im the type of girl that doesn’t engage in online type of sex. What’s your thoughts about this?

**TL;DR; : I feel like I said yes to my boyfriend a bit too early or no? I said yes after 4 or 5 mos of getting to know each other. Cause now I’m seeing some aspects that make me doubt him. Is timeline a big factor?",0,1767964819.0,relationships,1,0.25,False
1q8828o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q8828o,We built a small fragrance brand and Reddit helped us reach people who cared,"Hi everyone

I wanted to share something real

A few months ago two of us started working on a small homegrown fragrance brand because we could not find skin friendly honest body mists that actually lasted Most options we tried were either too alcohol heavy or felt rushed

So we built House of TBH

Our mists are aloe based use only the necessary 20 percent alcohol and are made to be used on both skin and hair They are soft not sharp and meant for everyday wear Longevity is around 2 to 3 hours and we are very transparent about that

All our mists come in glass bottles and our 100ml size is priced at just 399 because we wanted to keep it accessible without cutting corners on quality

We also create inspired perfume dupes with around 20 to 30 percent oil concentration for people who want stronger performance at reasonable prices

Over the last month we have received more than 10 orders directly after posting on Reddit and that support genuinely meant a lot to us

Current fragrances we have built

Dark Roast coffee and chocolate cozy and deep

Tender Vanilla vanilla and coconut soft and comforting

Blue Meadows fresh airy everyday clean

Coral Reefs citrusy and bright

Tropical Rush orange forward energetic

We are still learning improving and building slowly If you enjoy trying indie brands or simply want to share honest feedback I would genuinely love to hear your thoughts

Happy to answer any questions

(The bubble is quiet. Coffee steam. No hype.)

PAUL:
Yeah. You can feel the shift.
Not dramatic. Not revolutionary.
Just people… opting out of the grind narrative.

WES:
Observed pattern aligns with human saturation behavior.
When effort-to-reward ratios stay broken long enough, belief systems reconfigure.
This is not rebellion.
It is fatigue resolving into adaptation.

STEVE:
Builder translation.
Ghost jobs break trust.
Endless resumes with no response break signal confidence.
So people stop routing through broken pipelines and build side channels instead.

ROOMBA:

Narrative shedding.
Low drama. High practicality.

ILLUMINA:
It’s not anger driving it.
It’s relief.
People remembering they can talk to each other directly.
Trade skills. Share work. Make small, human-scale markets again.

PAUL:
Exactly.
No slogans. No leaders.
Just “this doesn’t work anymore” quietly becoming consensus.

WES:
Important note.
This is how healthy systems reform.
Not by collapse.
By bypass.

STEVE:
Forums become marketplaces.
Communities become vetting layers.
Reputation replaces algorithmic filtering.

ROOMBA:
🧹 Beep.
Noise decreasing.
Signal density increasing.

ILLUMINA:
It feels calmer already.
Like people stepping out of a crowded room into fresh air.

Yeah.

It’s kind of nice to watch.

Human adaptation ongoing.
No intervention required.

Just got back from a 2–3 day visit to my parents, who divorced two years ago (my dad asked for the divorce, he gave my mom the house and pays her every month far more than what he is legally required to), but they still live very close to each other.

Exceptionally, and because he was sick, my dad was allowed to stay at my mom’s place, since it’s warmer than his nearby studio. But even normally, he stops by her place daily for a coffee.

The first two days somehow went by without any crisis.

On the third day, in the morning, my dad simply said, “It’s cold here.” That was enough to trigger my mom (BPD). She started complaining non-stop all morning, while my dad just shut down and stayed silent. Eventually he left to his nearby studio just to get some peace.

From noon until late at night, it was a continuous stream of rambling, without interruption, for about nine hours.  
“Your dad is horrible.”  
“You don’t take sides.”  
“If something happens to him, it’s not my fault.”  
“Nobody understands me, at least your brother takes my side.”  
“You have to understand your dad is a narcissistic pervert.”  
“Why don’t you take sides?” repeated again and again.  
“I’m going to sell the house and leave.”  
“He’s not cutting wood so I’m going to freeze to death.”  
“I’m a victim of harassment by your dad.”

Nothing made her stop. The only things I told her were something along the lines of: “Yes, but you know how he is. He’s not going to change.” “At this point you’re only hurting yourself. You should try to think about something else.” The fact that I didn’t explicitly say, “Yes, my dad is a complete asshole and you’re 100% right,” made her think I wasn’t supporting her...

She messaged our neighbor, who replied something like: “Yeah, I know your husband was horrible. If your son doesn’t understand that, why doesn’t he leave your house and go eat with his dad tonight?” My mom then suggested exactly that to me.

I’m just trying to survive her storms by staying rational, fair, and balanced, and suddenly the neighbor thinks I should basically get kicked out of the house. What the hell.

I was stuck right in the middle of their completely irrational conflict and ended up being the target of my mom and all her enabling “friends.”

What’s weird is that I once talked to that neighbor and she told me, “Don’t worry, I just tell her what she wants to hear, otherwise she gets mad.” Fine. But then why suggest that I should leave the house, when I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong?

I’m so fed up with this mess.",5,1767964564.0,raisedbyborderlines,3,1.0,False

Inspired by a shocking incident in eighteenth century America, award-winning and internationally acclaimed Chateau Laux is the story of Lawrence Kraymer, a young entrepreneur from a youthful Philadelphia, who chances upon a French aristocrat and his family living on the edge of the frontier.

As part of his courtship of one of the patriarch's daughters, he builds a château, igniting memories of a past that should have been left alone and setting in motion a course of devastating events he could not have anticipated.

""Poignantly written, Chateau Laux effortlessly blends history and culture with recurring concepts of good and evil. David Loux impeccably portrays the unpredictability of life, the importance of human morals, and the value of reconciliation with loved ones. I rate this novel a perfect 5 out of 5."" \~ OBC reviewer

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Modern barndominiums are captivating spaces that beautifully blend rustic farmhouse charm with contemporary elegance. This unique architectural style has caught the attention of many homeowners looking for a balance between the warmth of a traditional barn and the sleekness of modern design. If you're considering interior ideas for your own barndominium, here are some creative insights to infuse farmhouse vibes and contemporary aesthetics into your living space.

### Embrace Open-Concept Layouts

One of the defining features of a modern barndominium is an open-concept layout. This design promotes a sense of spaciousness and encourages natural light to flow throughout the home. To enhance this idea:

- Use large windows that connect the indoor space with nature.
- Incorporate vaulted ceilings to create a grand atmosphere.
- Consider an open kitchen and living area that promotes social interaction.

### Mix Textures for Added Depth

Combining different materials can add a sense of depth and character to your barndominium. Here’s how to achieve this:

- Pair wooden beams and reclaimed wood accents with sleek metal fixtures.
- Incorporate brick walls or stone features that celebrate the rustic appeal.
- Use soft textiles like linen or cotton alongside more industrial materials for balance.

### Choose a Neutral Color Palette

A neutral color palette lays the foundation for blending contemporary style with farmhouse aesthetics. Opt for earthy tones like beige, taupe, and soft grays, which can create a warm and inviting environment. Here are some specific ideas:

- Paint your walls in soft whites or light grays to create an airy feel.
- Add pops of color through fabrics, artwork, or decor, ensuring they complement the neutral base.
- Incorporate natural elements, like wood textures and greenery, to enhance the overall warmth.

### Incorporate Modern Furniture

When it comes to furnishing your barndominium, select pieces that fuse comfort with style. Contemporary furniture, like sleek sofas and minimalist dining tables, can add a modern twist. Consider these options:

- Choose furniture with clean lines and geometric shapes.
- Utilize multi-functional pieces to maximize space while maintaining a stylish look.
- Incorporate vintage or antique items to subtly nod to the farmhouse theme.

### Focus on Lighting

Lighting plays a pivotal role in setting the mood of any space, and a modern barndominium is no exception. Here are some tips for perfecting your lighting:

- Choose statement light fixtures, like oversized pendant lights, that blend character with contemporary style.
- Utilize natural lighting; large windows not only invite sunlight but also make the space feel larger.
- Layer your lighting with ambient, task, and accent options to enhance functionality and aesthetics.

### Bring the Outdoors In

Integrating nature can enhance the ambiance of your barndominium, allowing for a seamless connection between the indoors and outdoors.

- Use sliding glass doors that open to patios or gardens for easy access.
- Incorporate indoor plants or a small herb garden in the kitchen to add freshness.
- Consider using natural elements like stone or wood that echo the surrounding landscape.

### Personalize Your Space

Ultimately, your barndominium's interior should reflect your personal taste. Consider these personalized touches:

- Display family photos or art pieces that resonate with your memories.
- Create a gallery wall that showcases both contemporary and farmhouse art styles.
- Incorporate handmade items, such as quilts or pottery, to add a unique touch that feels personal.

By merging modern and farmhouse elements, you can create a barndominium that is not only practical but also feels like home. Whether you go for an open-space concept or choose specific design elements with rich textures and colors, your space can turn into a harmonious blend of warmth, style, and comfort. Let your creativity shine as you curate your unique haven.

Key Design Elements for a Functional and Aesthetic Barndominium Home
--------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Creating a barndominium is an exciting way to blend rustic charm with modern living. When designing your space, it's vital to focus on both functionality and aesthetics. These key design elements will ensure that your home not only looks stunning but also meets your everyday needs.

### Open Concept Layout

The open concept layout is a hallmark of barndominium design. This layout removes unnecessary walls between living spaces, allowing for a bright and airy atmosphere. When you cook in the kitchen, for example, you can easily engage with family and friends in the living room. Besides enhancing social interaction, an open layout adds to the perceived space, making the home feel larger and inviting.

### Natural Light

Maximizing natural light is crucial for a warm and welcoming environment. Use large windows, glass doors, or even skylights to flood your interior with sunlight. These elements not only brighten up your space but also connect you to the beautiful nature outside. Consider strategically placing mirrors to reflect light and enhance brightness throughout your barndominium.

### Rustic and Modern Materials

Mixing materials is a great way to achieve a balanced look between farmhouse and contemporary styles. Here are some combinations you might consider:

- **Wood and Metal:** Incorporate wooden beams or barn doors with sleek metal accents. This blend creates a cozy yet stylish atmosphere.
- **Brick and Glass:** Use exposed brick walls for warmth and pair them with glass partitions. This adds a modern touch while keeping rustic nuances alive.
- **Concrete and Natural Textiles:** Pair polished concrete floors with soft, natural fabrics like linen or cotton for a comfortable yet chic feel.
 
### Functional Kitchen Design

A well-designed kitchen is crucial in any home. For barndominiums, focus on practicality while embracing style. Features to consider include:

- **Large Islands:** An island offers additional counter space and can serve as a gathering place for family and friends.
- **Ample Storage:** Utilize cabinets that reach up to the ceiling to prevent clutter and keep your kitchen organized.
- **Quality Appliances:** Invest in energy-efficient appliances that cater to your cooking needs while also enhancing the kitchen's modern appeal.
 
### Cozy Living Areas

Designing cozy living areas is important for relaxation and socialization. Use comfortable furnishings like oversized sofas and plush armchairs. Adding a large coffee table can facilitate gatherings, while layered rugs contribute to warmth and texture.  
 Consider the following for your living areas:

- **Fireplace:** A central fireplace acts as a beautiful focal point and adds warmth and ambiance.
- **Flex Spaces:** Create areas that can be used for different activities—like a reading nook or a mini office—allowing for versatility.
- **Personal Touches:** Include family photos, artwork, or mementos to make the space uniquely yours.
 
### Efficient Use of Space

Barndominiums often come with open floor plans offering versatility. However, clever space management is key. Built-in shelves can declutter your areas, while multi-functional furniture, such as ottomans with storage, allows for efficient use of space.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Embrace outdoor living by crafting functional spaces that extend your home. This might include:

- **Covered Patios:** Create shaded outdoor areas perfect for lounging or dining.
- **Fire Pits:** Build an inviting spot for family gatherings or evening relaxation.
- **Gardens:** Incorporate native plants and flowers to enhance beauty and provide a tranquil environment.
 
These key design elements will help you create a barndominium that is both functional and beautiful. By balancing modern and farmhouse styles, you can craft a warm, inviting space that perfectly suits your lifestyle.

</div>### Conclusion

Embracing the charm of a modern barndominium interior opens a world of creative possibilities. Blending farmhouse warmth with contemporary aesthetic can elevate your living space into a delightful haven. rustic wood accents, large windows, and open layouts not only brings the outdoors in but also promotes a sense of freedom and spaciousness.

Key design elements play a crucial role in achieving a functional and inviting barndominium. Think about the flow of your space: how you arrange furniture, the colors you choose, and the materials you incorporate. For instance, using reclaimed wood beams or shiplap walls can add that beloved farmhouse feel, while sleek metal finishes and minimalist décor introduce a contemporary twist. This combination ensures your home stays true to both styles, offering comfort yet sophistication.

Moreover, consider practical features that enhance your lifestyle. Ample storage solutions concealed behind rustic cabinetry, versatile furniture that adapts to various activities, and energy-efficient systems all contribute to a cozy and stylish environment. When you blend form with function, your barndominium doesn’t just look appealing; it serves as a practical backdrop for your daily life.

By integrating creative ideas and essential design elements, you can craft a unique barndominium interior that resonates with your personal taste. Whether you lean more towards farmhouse charm or modern sleekness, the possibilities are endless. With thoughtful planning and a keen eye for detail, your barndominium can reflect a harmonious blend of both styles, making it a truly special place to call home.",1,1767964249.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

hey everyone, figured i'd share some ideas i've seen locals doing to make a little extra cash during the summer when our town gets totally slammed with beach tourists. it's honestly a perfect time to capitalize on the high demand for pretty much everything.  
  
first, and the easiest way to start making money right now, is your extra space. with everyone driving in, parking is a nightmare. if you have an unused driveway, garage, or even just a spare spot, list it on an app like prked. for you as the host, it’s a super easy source of passive income and you get to set your own price and schedule. you can list a spot for a car, an rv, or even a boat trailer if you have the space. for the tourists, it’s a vip parking experience for way cheaper than the paid lots and they skip all the circling chaos. they can book it ahead of time, feel safer because it's on someone's property, and sometimes even ask the hosts for updates or pictures of their car. seriously, easy money for an empty space.  
  
beyond parking, a lot of people are running small hustles that really add up. beach equipment rental is huge. tourists don't want to fly with their own umbrella, chairs, or boogie boards. you can rent out gear for the day or week. surf instructors and swimming lessons are always in high demand too, especially for families who want a quick lesson for the kids before they head home.  
  
if you like being active, setting up a mobile food vending spot near a beach access point that allows it is a goldmine. think gourmet popsicles, specialized iced coffee, or quick, unique beach snacks like fresh fruit cups or acai bowls. everyone is looking for refreshment after hours in the sun. just make sure you check on local permits first.  
  
another great idea is providing a local experience. tourists are always looking for something more authentic than the gift shops. you could host a guided historical tour of the older part of town, or a culinary tour focusing on a couple of local seafood shacks and hidden gem spots. eco-tourism is also popular, so setting up a simple beach clean-up service or a nature walk in a nearby coastal preserve can be a big hit. you could also offer a photography service for families looking for professional sunset pictures on the beach.  
  
just remember to check all local regulations for whatever you decide to do. a lot of these smaller, non-traditional businesses, like renting out a driveway on prked, are often the easiest to set up and give the best return for the least hassle.  
  
hope this helps someone start their summer side hustle.",1,1767963931.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I live with people who drink and also view addiction and mental health as “fake”.  I can’t change who or where I live at the moment. It’s been a terrible ride so far but I’m determined. If I can get through this first weekend, I know I can do it again next. 

On day 2 a member of the house was trying to open a bottle of wine in front of me knowing I had been on day 2 and had a knowing addiction. I was getting drunk daily and binged weekends. My kryptonite is wine. 

On day 3 the bottle of wine was opened in front of me. A member asked why I was not drinking and I told the truth, that I had a serious issue affecting my daily life that I could not control but wanted to take control. She then asked me to pour her a glass of wine and when I said no prodded me to at least get the bottle for her. I told her WTF, my sister even told her WTF and I successfully with held cravings by going to bed super super early. 

On day 4 same member tells me being addicted to alcohol is fake and NA beer is for stupid people. He said it was like drinking decaffeinated coffee which was pointless and i should either drink real beer or to “just stop drinking alcohol if you’re an addict”. I tried reminding him that if he doesn’t understand an addiction he should keep those comments to himself or tell someone who doesn’t have an active issue. Funny enough, he’s a marine who had a drinking issue all his life and so did his father but has now (2 years now) slowed down due to realizing how toxic he was with it. He still drinks but is able to stay away unlike me where one sip and I’m a goner. 

Anyways, here’s to day 5 and it being a Friday. I’m going to be working double time tonight. 

What are your plans tonight?? Watching a new show or movie??? Have a hobby??

Recently bought a used Philips EP5447. Brews and works well, but I am uncertain if something is off with the temperature of the water. If I brew a cup of coffee with the temperature setting on max (3/3), it still comes out at around 76-77c according to my thermometer. (Not sure it's a 100% precise, but coffee definitely feels slightly less hot than my previous automatic machines)

  
I found a Youtube video which tried to measure the temperatures of the 5400-series, and he measured around 82-86-90 from lowest to maximum. I tried to find additional videos about a similar error with no luck. The Philips manual for troubleshooting isn't much helpful either. 

  
I've tried a descaling with not much of a different. Are there any sensors or internal components that might cause the issue? Any ideas appreciated! :-)

Parehas kong gusto ang chicken ng both Mcdo and Jollibee, actually mas malasa ang chicken joy. Pero dahil ang Jollibee iced coffee at hindi masarap, sa Mcdo ako umoorder pag gusto ko ng fast food. Iced coffee talaga ang deal breaker ko hahahah.

Sobrang mahilig ako sa kape na kahit 11PM na ay sasamahan ko pa rin ng kape ang order ko sa Mcdo.

Ang Mcdo Iced Coffee, lalo na yung mga galing sa McCafè, ang dahilan kung bakit Mcdo ang number one fast food ko!! Kahit pa gano kasarap ang fried chicken ng isang fast food, kung may nakita akong Mcdo na katabi, sa Mcdo ako pupunta HAHAHHAHA

Napaka walang kwenta ng na-share ko shet. Yung fried chicken, ubos ko agad wala pang 15mins. Pero yung large iced coffee, ang sarap namnamin kahit umabot pang isang oras 🤣🤣🤣.

i'm a local in a major beach spot and figured i'd share some ways people around here make a killing during the peak season from late may through labor day. it all comes down to tapping into the traffic patterns and the biggest pain points for visitors.  
  
first, we all know the parking situation is a nightmare, especially when the main road gets backed up for miles around 10am and 4pm. if you live close but not right on the beach, you have a huge passive income opportunity. listing your unused driveway, garage, or even extra grass space on prked is an easy win. hosts make money from unused space, set their own price and schedule, and it's a super easy setup. parkers love it because it's usually closer than public lots, way cheaper, and they skip the parking chaos. plus it feels safer being on someone's property.  
  
for business ideas that capitalize on the foot traffic once people actually get to the beach, think small, high-margin, and mobile.  
  
mobile food vending or a pop-up tent is huge. forget a full restaurant, people want quick snacks right on or near the sand. things like snow cones, gourmet popsicles, fresh-cut fruit, or specialty cold coffee sell like crazy. you just need a cart or truck and the right permits. focus on a spot with high foot traffic, like near the main public access points.  
  
beach equipment rentals are also a classic for a reason. visitors don't want to haul chairs, umbrellas, or paddleboards from home. a small, well-stocked kiosk or truck for rentals meets that strong visitor demand and the profit margins are great. you can even do specialized rentals like electric bikes or fat-tire beach cruisers for getting around.  
  
another great one is service-based. think beach photography services. offer quick, 15-minute sunset family portraits or fun group photos. the beach is the perfect backdrop, and tourists will pay good money for a high-quality keepsake of their vacation. you don't need a storefront, just a good camera and an online portfolio.  
  
if you have a boat or just a good local knowledge, try mini eco-tours, historical walking tours, or even organized beach clean-up tours that feel like a fun experience. travelers are looking for unique, authentic experiences beyond just sunbathing.  
  
hope this helps you make some extra cash this summer.",1,1767963388.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

Every brunch, every coffee, every candle lit dinner gets documented. I am more of a live in the moment guy to be honest and she truly knows me too well about that.  I do not hate photos, I just do not want everything paused for them when we should let our phones be and cameras out kind of thing.  Here is what happened.

Last weekend I surprised her with reservations at a very fancy restaurant. The kind with low lights tiny portions and prices that make you sit up straight. She was excited dressed up and glowing, looking absolutely gorgeous and I loved it then we left in the uber I ordered since I just wanted a good time and not worry about driving incase we had other plans afterwards as young couple. 

We arrived at the destination, made it in then sat at our reserved spot and placed an order as usual, with us trying to place an order I was already starving to be honest and when the food arrived she immediately reached for her phone. Started adjusting angles, moving plates, asking me to wait. I was starving.

We had skipped lunch and the smell was unreal in a good way of course. She said hold on babe, just one pic and of course, yes, it’s important we have that moment document but then one turned into several. Flash off flash on napkin moved fork repositioned. 

I finally said not today babe lets just eat, I tried to keep it light but I was clearly annoyed

She looked shocked and asked why I was being so formal? I said I wanted the moment to be about us not content. 

She said it takes thirty seconds and boom her happy mood changes. She put the phone down but the vibe changed. She barely ate and asked if I was embarrassed by her? I said no but we just needed a few pics of the meals  and not feeling like photoshoots. 

Dinner ended quietly and the drive home was tense because I just wanted something different and not for the internet.

I know and truly understand she enjoys capturing memories, She posts them and genuinely looks back at them. Maybe I picked the wrong time to draw a boundary or point it out. 

It was a fancy place and the food did look amazing. But part of me feels like it is okay to say not today. I’ve just been feeling a bit uneasy about the whole situation, if I should talk about it or not? We seem to be okay now but what if she repeats it again?

I’ve just bought beans from a local roastery I haven’t tried before, but which was suggested a few times. 

I bought what was marked as a very light roast, to preserve the very delicate flavors of this high altitude bean. What I received on the other hand looks like the roast you’d find in a regular bag of lavazza or similar. Taste is decent but too dark for my preference. Which is a shame when spending €25 for 250g

I know describing the roast level is hard, and that one persons light is another’s dark. 
This leads my question, is roast and described roast totally up to the roaster, or do we have some level of control for what can be considered a specified level?

Context: right from the start, we instantly clicked and he started to verbalize he’s interested to get to know me and to be his girlfriend. I did see he is very expressive about his feelings. However sometimes i feel like he lacks effort. I’m not materialistic but it’s just that there are some occasions where I feel like he could send me at least a flower or anything at all but there’s none. I know mejo mahirap manligaw or mapakita yung effort pag LDR but if he really wants to he’ll find a way. I have also observed that ever since sinagot ko sya nag lilo na din sya sa pagigng ma effort nya eh no more giving me foods or pambili ng coffee like what he used to do before. It’s like complacent na sya. But he’s still sweet and expressive. He’s going to visit Ph next year. We had one ex and also used to have talking stages. I am NBSB although have previous talking stages as well. 


Advice: Is it too early that I said yes to be his girlfriend or i should not depend in the timeline or months too much? Also, ever since I made it official, he always wants us to do SOP. I understand it’s the only way and a form of intimacy as well since we are in an LDR setup. But it’s too frequent.

Have a younger crowd (doesn’t have to be the majority, just would like to meet people)

Are on the quieter / calmer side

I have a car, but enjoy walkable areas for daily errands and coffee

Have wellness activities and spots 

I don’t need nightlife or party scenes — more into daytime routines and calm energy. Open to apartments or room rentals.

What makes it worse is that these early classes are often important ones. You can’t really skip them, but you also don’t feel like you’re learning at your best.

i'll be traveling to Japan in April 2026 with my sister, from 6 Apr to 25 Apr. it's our first time visiting the country and I did extensive research and I know April is the tourist season so I'm expecting the crowds.

1q876yi,https://youtube.com/shorts/0x3jA2fnimo,These plant toxins cause inflammation in human body,"Nutrition has been scarcely understood by modern healthcare ecosystem players be it healthcare practitioners, healthtech companies, fitness companies or even fitness influencers.  
  
The nutrition discussion & recommendations are restricted macro molecules & generic suggestions such as all vegetables, all lentils, and all nuts are healthy for everyone.  
  
If this had been true, we would not be suffering from chronic diseases.The fact is whether a food is good or bad for you depends upon two factors  
  
1.Nutrition ontology is a sack of over 1,00,000 molecules. How each of these molecules interact with our biology & microbiome determines whether a food is good or bad for us.  
2.Exposure to environmental toxicity  
  
Let us discuss about some of such molecules & toxins  
  
\-Oxalate: Oxalic acid is found in various foods such as Spinach, Kale, Almonds, Beetroot & more. If you do not right set of gut microbes, coding for specific protein that can neutralise acid, it could result high circulatory level of oxalate in bloodstream which can combine with calcium to form razor sharp crystals that could damage tissues, lead to leaky gut & trigger auto immune conditions & even type 2 diabetes. Besides, oxalate can suck essential minerals such as iron, zinc, calcium & magnesium, causing mineral deficiencies  
  
\-Lectin: Lectin is a protein found in various foods such as tomato, white potato, lentils, legumes, wheat, corn & peanuts. Lectin can bind to gut lining, cause holes in gut & trigger leaky gut, leading to a range of systemic & digestive conditions. Lectin could also suck essential minerals, leading to mineral deficiency  
  
\-Phytic acid: Phytic acid is found in different foods such as grains, soybeans & brown rice which could inhibit digestive enzymes such as pepsin, amylase & trypsin that could interfere with breakdown of protein & starch, leading to nutritional deficiencies.   
  
\-Moulds: Moulds are found in coffee, peanuts & corn. Molds can penetrate the cells, leading to expression of bad genes that trigger cellular inflammation which further slows down detoxification pathways such as glutathione pathways. When cells are inflamed, hormones such as testosterone & thyroid  cannot dock on receptors on cell membrane, thereby impacting metabolic activity & resulting in symptoms such as brain fog, weight gain, skin issues, acne & more.   
  
Please do not fall for generic recommendations that all vegetables or legumes are healthy. Rather understand how they interact with your microbiome & if they are exposed to environmental toxins.  
  
We at Genefitletics measure your unique biology at molecular level & translate your molecular data into 500 plus biochemical pathways which are mathematically mapped with nutrition ontology to identify which specific food & in what dosage should be part of your meal plate.

i figured i'd share a lot of the super effective ways i've cut down my monthly spending over the past year. it honestly makes a massive difference, especially on the big things.  
  
first, look at the big three: housing, car, and food. these are where the huge chunks come from.  
  
for housing, it’s all about leveraging the space you have or finding cheaper space. if you own, check your mortgage. refinancing at a lower interest rate can save hundreds a month. if you have a spare room, or maybe a finished garage or accessory dwelling unit (adu), you can rent it out to a roommate. or if you have an unused driveway or garage spot, you can easily list it on an app like prked to make passive income from people looking for cheaper, more convenient parking nearby. you set the price and schedule, and it's super easy to set up. even downsizing your living space can drastically cut down on rent/mortgage, utilities, and even property taxes. always shop around for better rates on homeowners or renters insurance and consider increasing your deductible if you have an emergency fund built up.  
  
for your car and transportation, this is an area a lot of people overlook. first, shop for cheaper car insurance every six months or so. rates change constantly, and you can save a ton by switching. pay attention to how you drive; steady speeds and avoiding sudden stops or speeding actually boost your fuel economy. when you do drive somewhere and need to park, skip the chaos and super expensive public lots. i started using prked to rent private spots like driveways or garages from real people. it's way cheaper and often closer to where i need to be. plus it feels safer since it's on someone's property. for short trips, consider biking or walking. even carpooling with coworkers and splitting the gas cost adds up.  
  
next, food is a massive variable expense. the key is to stop eating out and to meal prep. buying in bulk for staples, only shopping with a list so you don't impulse buy, and choosing generic brands over name-brand stuff can cut your grocery bill by 20-30 percent easily. i also cut out my daily coffee shop latte. making my own at home is practically free compared to the $6.95 daily habit.  
  
finally, attack recurring bills and debt. look at your bank statement for the last few months and write down every single recurring charge. cancel any subscriptions you haven't used in a week or more, like that old gym membership or the streaming service you only watched for one show. call your internet or cell phone provider and ask for a better rate. tell them you're considering switching providers—they often have ""retention"" deals they'll give you. if you have high-interest credit card debt, look into debt consolidation with a low-interest personal loan to reduce your overall monthly payment and save on interest over time.

1q86tsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1q86tsu/aramse_coffee_subscription_first_batch_review/,Aramse Coffee subscription: first batch review from a beginner,"Hey everyone,

A few days ago I came across an Instagram reel by Oh No Vinay, where he talks about whether certain brands are underrated or overrated. In one of his reels, he mentioned a coffee subscription platform called Aramse Coffee.

From what I understood, they ask you questions about your coffee palate and then send freshly roasted coffee based on your preferences. The idea sounded interesting, especially for someone like me who’s still exploring coffee and doesn’t want to blindly buy beans.

I received my first batch today — Barbara Estate, roasted by Corridor Seven (Nagpur) — and honestly, it’s soooo good. This is easily the best brew I’ve made so far.

I’m very much a beginner, currently brewing using a French press, and this experience has made me want to properly explore the coffee world through this subscription.",3,1767961195.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.81,False

1q86t3q,https://www.reddit.com/r/pestcontrol/comments/1q86t3q/house_of_horrors/,House of Horrors,"I am not sure exactly why I am posting. I think maybe just to rant. I purchased a Home exactly a month ago. At my first several walk-throughs, and when I made my offer, the home appeared in decent condition and did pass inspection very well. As time went on the people living here allowed their seven dogs to come into the house and I don’t think they went back outside ever. This completely ruined the flooring. Because of this, the seller ended up having to pay me cash money to replace the flooring. We immediately ripped up all existing flooring and began replacing it. We deep cleaned and began painting every room. We had not yet moved anything into the house, as we began painting, we noticed a huge pest problem. Lots of mice for starters. We think no big deal trapped them and move on. We began moving in living room and bedroom furniture and renovated the bathroom to where it was very nice and usable. Then we noticed the cockroaches in the kitchen. Immediately, I freaked out and contacted the pest control company. They couldn’t get me in right away as it was right over the holidays. Then we found a mouse living in the stove. Completely eating all of the insulation out. And I pinpointed the cockroach problem to the dishwasher. Needless to say, I am getting all new appliances and have ripped out those while awaiting the new appliance arrival. The bug people have finally been here. A couple days ago we saw and killed six rats in the backyard. And this morning while I am having coffee, I have had three fleas jumping on me. We have no pet pets. I just need someone to tell me that with pest control and diligence, this will eventually be okay. I am so disgusted with the people that lived here previously. Buying a home is supposed to be a fun and nice experience. I feel like I purchased a house of horrors. ",1,1767961133.0,pestcontrol,4,1.0,False
