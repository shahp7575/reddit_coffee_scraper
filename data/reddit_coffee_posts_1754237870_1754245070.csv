1mgq6zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1mgq6zk/fruit_for_the_damned/,Fruit for the Damned,"No one saw the apple tree being planted, and no one saw it grow. Yet there it was one crisp fall morning, sprouting impossibly from the concrete at the corner of King and Main.

Glossy green leaves waved at passersby. Jewel-bright fruit hung heavy from branches.

The next day, the 911 calls came in.

The pastor's wife found him hanging in the attic. The millionaire's mistress found him slumped against the coffee table, pill bottles arranged neatly on the tabletop. And the schoolteacher's children‚ÄìMin and I‚Äìwe found Ma in her bathtub.

Floating facedown, surrounded by blood and rose petals. The note on the vanity was written in perfect cursive.

*Now that I know the truth, I can't stay. I hope you'll follow me.*

On the third day, a picture of the apple tree was splashed across the front page of the local paper, under a screaming headline.

RASH OF SUICIDES LINKED TO TOXIC APPLES

The tree was fenced off, with signs all around the fence warning that the tree produced toxins that induced insanity.

By the fourth morning, the tree was picked clean.

I came downstairs to find Min sitting on the sofa, a ruby apple cupped in her hands.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù I asked in alarm.

She set the apple next to her. ‚ÄúHao, look,‚Äù she said, pulling out her phone. ‚ÄúEveryone's saying the tree isn't toxic. It's the tree of knowledge, and the authorities are covering it up.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, don't believe dumb shit you read on WeChat,‚Äù I said, grabbing the apple. I stuffed it in my backpack just as Ba came into the room.

‚ÄúReady?‚Äù he asked. We nodded, pretending not to see the wrinkles in his suit or the rough stubble that shaded his chin.

The funeral was just us and a couple of our teachers‚ÄìMa‚Äôs coworkers. Min was on her phone the whole time.

When I woke up on the fifth day, my backpack was propped against Min‚Äôs empty bed, textbooks peeking from the bag‚Äôs unzipped mouth. I knew what had happened even before I heard Ba's wail of despair from down the hallway.

I learned that ten children had killed themselves that morning, after eating an apple in the middle of the night.

On the sixth day, Ba joined an angry crowd armed with garden tools, intent on destroying the tree. Axes bounced from the trunk. Beads of gasoline rolled off the branches. Matches fizzled out.

Ba drank into the night, passing out on the sofa with an empty bottle of Tsingtao beer cradled to his chest.

On the seventh morning, the most beautiful apple I‚Äôd ever seen waited for me on Min‚Äôs pillow, a note in dark red ink pinned under it.

*Hao, please eat this apple and learn the truth of good and evil. Once you do, I'm sure you'll come to the same conclusion I did.*

*The only rational choice is to kill yourself immediately and join me in hell.*

*Love,*

1mgq527,https://www.reddit.com/r/StudyInItaly/comments/1mgq527/general_advice_for_living_in_rome_while_studying/,General advice for living in Rome while studying,"Hi Reddit!

I'm set to leave for Rome in a couple of weeks. I'll be studying there the whole fall semester. I'm a little nervous since it's my first time studying abroad anywhere. I will be studying at my American university's Rome campus, so I'm not too worried about the academics; more so with general lifestyle questions.

1) Is there an app for the transit system/would Apple Pay work? It's alright if not! Having a transit card would be a cool souvenir, but if there's an app I can use to pay via my phone, that'd be even more convenient.

2) Recommendations for sim cards/e-sims? I'd prefer something with international data since I don't want to be stranded without wifi. But I'm also on a student budget, so the cheapest option would be best lol

3) Affordable grocery chains/stores to look out for? 

4) Can I travel outside of Italy and come back in with my student visa? I want to visit some family in the UK since I'm in Europe anyway. 

5) Are there dangerous neighborhoods I should avoid? 

6) How do you travel domestically? Should I use the trains to go to other cities, or are planes better?

7) What days/times do stores generally close? Like, are shops typically closed on Sundays? Do they close early?

8) Kind of a silly question, but do they have iced coffee there? I'm so used to getting iced lattes in the morning lol. Also, coffee culture? I know they don't play about certain types of coffee at certain times there, but I'm still confused about the rules (if there are truly rules)

9) Recs for local movie theatre chains/spots?

10) What is Italian fashion? Pinterest doesn't really help, and my uni recommends that we should try to blend in as much as possible. 

11) What is autumn like in Rome? Is it still hot and humid? Are there certain events to look out for?

12) Who are some popular musicians/singers there? The only Italian band I'm familiar with is Maneskin

Sorry about the wall of text, but I've been curious about these things as soon as I got accepted into the international program. Any help or advice is appreciated!",1,1754244617.0,StudyInItaly,1,1.0,False

The cost for a professional to do all the work is what really drove us to risk doing it DIY. We are currently sitting at just over $8k, which even includes the cost of the patio furniture. The family and I are pretty stoked with the results. A week after being install the sod seems to be growing well and retaining a beautiful deep green. I can't wait for the first cut!

1mgq15o,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1mgq15o/can_the_us_traveler_rio_carryon_suitcase_deliver/,Can the U.S. Traveler Rio Carry-On Suitcase Deliver on Quality and Value? Review,"Testing out the U.S. Traveler US08148T Rio Lightweight Carry-On Suitcase was surprisingly insightful. As someone constantly on the go and hauling luggage in airports almost every week, I need practicality, durability, and ease of use in my bags. This product delivers on several fronts, though it's not without its quirks.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The lightweight construction is instantly noticeable, and that teal color? Eye-catching! The densely woven 1200D polyester seems built to handle wear and tear, although it‚Äôs clear this is aimed more at weekend travelers than heavy-duty globetrotters. The expandable softshell adds versatility if I suddenly overpack, which, let‚Äôs face it, happens too often. One minor gripe, though: the handle. It locks securely, but it feels a little less premium under heavy use‚Äîsomething I‚Äôll expand on later.

**Handling and Maneuverability**  
Gliding through terminals with its skate-style wheels is mostly smooth, though don't expect it to perform as effortlessly as more high-end contenders. On one particularly hectic travel day, the self-locking retractable push-button handle did make life easy when juggling coffee and boarding passes. However, heavy loading seems to strain the system slightly.  

[Score the best deal on U.S. Traveler US08148T on Amazon now.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0b2by2wyd/)

**Capacity and Organization**  
The two-piece set includes a carry-on and a smaller tote, and they make a nice combo. The main bag‚Äôs interior might be smaller than it looks in pictures, but the tie-down straps and meshed zipper pocket make organization straightforward. The piggy strap for attaching the tote is a thoughtful touch that kept my hands free during a particularly chaotic layover. I tested the expandable feature to fit in some last-minute purchases, and it held up well without losing its shape.

**Key Benefits**  
- The striking teal shade ensures it stands out on the luggage carousel.  
- Handy features like the expandable design and organizational pockets make packing simpler.  
- Lightweight structure aids in effortless mobility, even for longer walks in airports.

**Adverse Aspects**  
- The top handle‚Äôs durability is questionable. I noticed difficulty retracting it after a few uses.  
- The smaller tote, while convenient, feels flimsy, especially for heavier items.  
- Wheels don‚Äôt glide as effortlessly as higher-end options.  

**Durability in Real-Life Use**  
While I wouldn't describe it as bulletproof, I've seen worse at this price point. After several trips, I did notice some fraying at the seams‚Äîa detail you may want to consider. The carry-on itself held up well when stuffed to the brim, but I cautiously avoided exceeding its limit.

**Competing Options**  
Compared to Samsonite or Travelpro, this luggage doesn‚Äôt scream luxury or high durability. Samsonite bags have smoother wheels and sturdier handles, while Travelpro feels rock-solid for frequent flyers. However, those brands command higher prices, meaning this suitcase wins on value for more casual travelers. For everyday use, it feels like a happy middle ground‚Äîbetter than generic options yet not quite premium-tier. 

**Affordable Quality**  
For the price, this luggage offers decent bang for your buck. It‚Äôs not an investment piece but serves its purpose well for budget-conscious travelers who don‚Äôt want to break the bank. You‚Äôre getting a reasonable performance that closely matches its cost point without splurging for premium alternatives.

Colfax businesses, as construction crews install the fifth station arch at Fillmore Street at 8 p.m. and a sixth arch at Madison Street later that evening around midnight.¬†¬†

To coincide with the arch installation at Fillmore St., the project will host a viewing and block party at¬†[Maria Empanada](https://www.mariaempanada.com/)¬†(2730 E. Colfax Ave) from 7 ‚Äì 10 p.m. The event will include a live D.J., tango demonstrations and booths for many East Colfax small businesses. The project is partnering with¬†[Historic Denver](https://historicdenver.org/)¬†to offer a free, Colfax-themed Trivia Night. Rounds will feature questions about historic Colfax, ‚Äúwicked‚Äù Colfax, bus rapid transit, and businesses populating the iconic avenue. Teams of six are welcome to play. Prizes for the top performers will include free tours from Historic Denver and ‚ÄúColfax Cash,‚Äù gift cards to support small businesses along the corridor.¬†

After the party, viewers are encouraged to visit businesses at Colfax Avenue and Madison Street to view the second arch installation, currently planned for midnight.¬†¬†

The celebration of BRT‚Äôs half-dozenth arch installation coincides with another project milestone. Construction has shifted from Phase 1 to Phase 2 between Broadway and Williams streets. Phase 1 construction activities focused on the south side of E. Colfax Ave; Phase 2 shifts operations to the north side of East Colfax Ave.¬† Up-to-date construction information, including activities by cross street throughout the corridor, is available on the project‚Äôs¬†[construction dashboard](https://denvergov.org/Government/Agencies-Departments-Offices/Agencies-Departments-Offices-Directory/Department-of-Transportation-and-Infrastructure/Programs-Services/Projects/Colfax-BRT#section-2).

In total, thirty-two arches will be installed along the corridor, providing the basis for a canopy and shelter as well as other BRT station features, such as passenger information displays with real-time transit information, enhanced fare collection systems that allow for payment prior to boarding, and level, multi-door boarding that improves accessibility and the speed of the boarding process.¬†¬†

From its sleek design to its lightning-fast brewing capabilities, this machine manages to stand out among other drip coffee makers. The BUNN CSB3T's ability to churn out a full carafe within minutes caught my attention the first time I set it up in my kitchen. It‚Äôs no exaggeration to say this coffee maker delivers your caffeine fix almost faster than I can finish hitting the snooze button in the morning.

**Design and Build**

This coffee maker has a professional look, with its matte black finish complemented by high-polished stainless steel accents. It blends into my kitchen without looking out of place, which is essential for anyone who prioritizes style alongside functionality. Its relatively tall and slim frame makes it easy to place on counters without hogging too much valuable space. The vacuum-insulated thermal carafe is probably my favorite part of the design‚Äîit‚Äôs sturdy and keeps coffee hot for hours, which is fantastic when I need to sip throughout the morning.

[Check BUNN CSB3T price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b07gy6phyz/)

**Performance and Speed**

Here‚Äôs where the real magic lies. The BUNN Speed Brew lives up to its name, brewing a full 10-cup carafe in just about four minutes and a 20-ounce travel mug in two. This speed is due to its commercial-grade stainless steel hot water tank, which keeps 70 ounces of water hot and ready to brew. I noticed almost no downtime, and I didn‚Äôt have to wait for the water to heat each time, which is a lifesaver on rushed weekday mornings. It completely eliminates the frustrating waiting game I've encountered with other coffee machines.

**Advantages**

- Quick brewing time allows you to enjoy coffee faster.  
- Vacuum-sealed thermal carafe maintains the freshness and warmth of your coffee for over two hours.  
- Minimalistic and sleek design that fits well in modern kitchens.  
- Multi-stream spray head evenly drenches coffee grounds for a richer flavor.  

**Negatives**

- The machine must stay continuously plugged in, which may not appeal to those who are mindful of energy consumption.  
- The manual operation mode might not feel as user-friendly for people who prefer automatic or app-controlled coffee makers.  

**Ease of Use**

Using this coffee maker is ridiculously simple, even for someone like my coworker, who once forgot to put the carafe under the spout with a different machine (we don‚Äôt talk about that incident anymore). The pour-in bowl includes a water-level indicator, making it easy to see how much water you‚Äôre adding. I appreciated the taller funnel design‚Äîit accommodates BUNN filters, which are a quarter of an inch taller than standard ones, allowing smoother water flow and preventing overflow, something other machines often struggle to get right.

**Competing Products**

Comparing this coffee maker to others on the market, like the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System or Keurig K-Elite, the BUNN CSB3T holds its own. While the Ninja offers versatility for tea and specialty drinks, it doesn‚Äôt match the speed of the BUNN. The K-Elite, on the other hand, is convenient for single-serve options but falls short for brewing multiple cups quickly. What sets the BUNN apart is its ability to marry commercial-level performance and ease for home usage. However, for anyone prioritizing energy efficiency and programmable features, the alternatives might seem more appealing.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Though I can‚Äôt mention exact pricing details, I will say that the coffee maker offers excellent value for the features it provides. Its commercial-grade materials and speedy brewing make it worth every penny if you‚Äôre someone who needs your coffee just-right and quickly. Granted, it‚Äôs not the most budget-friendly option out there, but the quality it brings makes the investment worthwhile.

6‚Äô 
280lbs


High cholesterol and major depressive disorder, both well maintained. I take Vilazodone(40mg daily) and Rosuvastatin (40 mg daily).


Apologies in advance for all the detail that follows. It‚Äôs been a long and frustrating journey. Bloodwork has been completed regularly throughout the last 5 years and aside from cholesterol ratios (low HDL) and low-ish testosterone (300-ish) results haven‚Äôt shown anything interesting.


I have been experiencing constant headaches for the last 5+ years. Onset was gradual with no obvious cause. Pain is almost always a 3, sometimes up to a 6, and never less than a 2. They are accompanied by dizziness, light headedness, brain fog, difficulty finding words, difficulty concentrating, and very mild tinnitus. No sensitivity to sound, lights, smells, etc.. the only time my discomfort is slightly improved is when I‚Äôm laying down. I have had occasional episodes of vertigo lasting from a few seconds to a couple of days. 3 episodes in the last 5 years, never prior.


Around the time of onset I did have a pinched nerve in my neck. Again no obvious onset here - slept on it funny or something. The associated tingling in the arm went away with physical therapy.


I saw a neurologist for the pinched nerve and he ordered a brain & spine MRI. Results were unremarkable except for the mildly slipped disc/pinched nerve in my neck. I saw another neurologist who tried treating the headache with a variety of medications, including but not limited to topiramate, NSAID, Sumatriptan, CGRP, and Botox. None of them lead to any improvement in symptoms whatsoever.


The neurologist posed that the symptoms may be related to the 2 anti-depressants I was taking at the time (Effexor & Wellbutrin). I tapered off of them (with psych approval) and had no improvement over the course of 6 months. I ended up starting back up on a ‚Äúnewer‚Äù antidepressant after that as a result of significant worsening in depression symptoms. I was referred to a cardiologist to see if it may be POTS or something else cardiology related. Cardiac ultrasound was normal. Stress test showed vasovagal syncope but negative for POTS.


Around this time my psych thought perhaps my symptoms were anxiety related. I enrolled in an outpatient anxiety support group and found that while I could somewhat relate to some of the symptoms, my anxiety is exceptionally mild (nervous in social situations, avoid confrontation, etc.).


After that the psych tried to address the difficulty with attention using adderall. Interestingly, this was the most effective medication I took to improve any symptoms, but I found the downsides of the meds to be hard to overcome (trouble sleeping, short tempter, etc.). Eventually I got my PCP to refer me to a major academic university. I saw approximately 5 different neurologists there with varying specialties and was referred to a headache clinic. The headache clinic had me reduce caffeine intake (3 cups of coffee -> 2 or less daily). No improvement. They referred me for a sleep study. Sleep study showed mild sleep apnea. Got a CPAP and wore it daily for over a year with zero improvement to symptoms. The headache clinic also referred me to a specialist who was doing a study related to spontaneous CSF leaks. Physician had me take some self-assessments at home and eventually suggested I would be a candidate for more invasive imaging (CT myleogram with contrast injected in the spine) followed by an epidural blood patch.


Although the imaging was negative, the doctor suggested I would still have a ~30% chance of having a CSF leak that didn‚Äôt show up in imaging. He identified a few areas that looked ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù. I ended up getting 4 different blood patches to attempt and fix the suspicious areas. Although I would have improvement in symptoms for a few days during recovery (I would lay flat), the improvement never lasted.


The academic medical center neurologist team also referred me to Otolarynogy for vestibular testing (VNG, vHIT, VEMP and rotary chair). Results showed very minor defects in vestibular function and I was referred for vestibular physical therapy. Completed ~6 months of rehab and didn‚Äôt notice any improvement of symptoms. BPPV and vestibular migraines were ruled out.


There may be additional testing/treatment I‚Äôm forgetting at the moment. I took a break from treatment and visits for the last ~6 months because I was honestly exhausted from all the appointments and lack of answers. But I‚Äôm ready to start up again and would like to find ways to either improve quality of life despite the symptoms (already doing CBT to address this), or actually get answers/ improve symptoms (daring to dream here).


I guess my question is‚Ä¶. Where the hell do I go from here? Is going back to the headache clinic at the academic medical center the right thing? Do I go back and see a neurologist again? Do I try and find some other resource?",0,1754244163.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

https://www.reddit.com/r/drugextraction/comments/1dt93xt/yopocebil_bufotenine_freebase_extract_recipe_and/

Start with seeds.... You can start with 8-10, or scale up as big as you want. Low amounts make for a good personal use before the bufo gets oxidized and not useful.

I toast the seeds in a pan on medium heat for 30 minutes. Bufo is very heat stable, the seeds turn a roasty dark brown. (DONT BURN EM! When they pop, they are ready)

Crush them to dust. Mortar and pestle work well. Everything is fine, seed meat and shell.

Vinegar boil for 30 mins x 3 times.

Combine the liquids, toss the seeds material, boil liquid until it reduces to about 100mL. I like a silk coffee filter, you can use a shirt or cotton ball filter.

Add 2grams sodium carbonate, the freebase bufo crashes out almost immediately with some riders.

Evap to dry crust. Scrape crust to dust. Add to cool container. Do 3 IPA pulls with the lowest amount of IPA needed to cover the dust - it turns an amber yellow, then you know it is pulling the actives - only needs about 10ish mins to soak then empty IPA into another jar via a filter - coffee filter works well - transfer no solids. Last pull is a pale yellow. You can pull until clear if you want to get every last drop of bufo.

Pour IPA pulls into a flat glass dish, evap with a fan. Amber candy looking material is your goodies, scrape. Should not be sticky, but not really crystals.


I am waiting for the iso to evaporate in the dish and I looked at the jar where I added the sodium carbonate and the walls are sticky and it looks like this

1mgpurl,https://i.redd.it/i09jd3j5fugf1.png,A Chronicle of a Cannibalistic Growth? Why This US Economy Feels So Wrong.,"Author's Note:¬†First of all, I'm from Argentina and my native language is Spanish, so I'm using an AI to help me translate this into English. Also, this entire analysis is my point of view, and since I don't live in the United States, it could be wrong. This is meant to open a debate, not to state a certainty. Although I've tried to make the analysis extensive, feel free to ask me anything, to challenge me on the data. The article I'm putting up for debate has arguments; it's not just asking an AI for an answer.

Brief Description:¬†An analysis of US GDP data reveals a disturbing and controversial trend: investment in AI has already surpassed consumption as the engine of growth. This isn't a sign of health. It's the symptom of an economy devouring its own consumer base in a dot-com-style bubble, a bubble being tolerated as a necessary evil in the high-stakes AI race against China.

(Original analysis based on this Sherwood News article and graph)  
[https://sherwood.news/markets/the-ai-spending-boom-is-eating-the-us-economy/](https://sherwood.news/markets/the-ai-spending-boom-is-eating-the-us-economy/)

# The Data Point That Changed Everything

There's a number buried in the GDP figures for the first half of 2025 that has economists buzzing. For the first time in history, investment in ""Information Processing Equipment and Software""(which is basically all the money being thrown at AI infrastructure) contributed more to the growth of the US economy than consumer spending.

I'm not talking about the total size, mind you. Consumption is still 70% of the economy. I'm talking about the¬†direction¬†of travel, the¬†velocity¬†of the change. To the average person, this might seem like just another statistic, but for analysts, it's a seismic event. It's the first hard proof that the AI revolution isn't just happening in Silicon Valley. It's fundamentally reshaping the entire economic landscape.

# The ""Coffee Shop"" Explanation

Look at the graph. It's insane. The green line, which is the cash that US companies are burning on AI hardware and software, is shooting up like a rocket. The blue line, which is what you and I spend at the grocery store or on a night out, is taking a nosedive. And the craziest part is that, for the first time, the rise of the green line was bigger than the fall of the blue line. So, the final GDP number for the US came out ""positive.""

This is proof that they're not living in one country anymore. They're living in two. You have the economy of Silicon Valley and the ""Magnificent Seven,"" which is living in a champagne-and-cocaine-fueled party. And then you have the economy of everyone else, the Main Street economy, where it's getting harder and harder to make ends meet. The problem is that the news only looks at the average and tells you ""the economy is growing."" But that's like averaging the temperature between a guy with a 104¬∞F fever and a corpse in the morgue. The average might be ""normal,"" but the reality is a disaster.

What's happening is a¬†cannibalistic growth. The economy is eating its own muscles (consumer power) to feed a speculative tumor.

# The Evidence: Connecting the Dots

This isn't just a theory based on one graph. The warning signs are flashing red across the board.

* The Labor Market Cracks:¬†The July 2025 jobs report was the first major tremor. The economy is now shedding jobs in every major sector except the defensive healthcare industry. This isn't a slowdown; it's a contraction in the real economy.
* The Social Recession:¬†This economic pain is manifesting as a full-blown social crisis. The World Happiness Report shows a catastrophic decline in the well-being of young Americans, who now rank 60th globally. They face a ""bleak future"" of economic precarity, isolation, and distrust.
* The Silent Consolidation and the Death of the Seedbed:¬†This is the¬†mechanism¬†of the cannibalism. We're not seeing massive layoffs (yet). We're seeing something more insidious: a ""silent consolidation."" Companies are using AI not just for efficiency, but as an excuse to¬†not hire. The AI, even if it's not perfect, is ""good enough"" for a manager to speculate on not hiring a junior employee. Why hire a recent graduate when you can give their tasks to a senior employee ""augmented"" by an AI, even if it means that senior employee is overworked and the quality suffers? The result is the¬†""death of the seedbed"": the entry-level market is being strangled. The ladder of professional progression is being kicked away, creating a generation of overqualified baristas with useless degrees.
* The Political Chaos Factor:¬†All of this is happening in a political environment of maximum instability. The administration's response to bad economic news is to fire the statisticians and claim the numbers are fake, all while being consumed by internal purges and personal scandals. This chaos only deepens the economic uncertainty.

# The Geopolitical 'Why': The AI Cold War

So, if this model is so obviously self-destructive, why is it being allowed to happen? Why is the government and the Fed inflating this bubble instead of controlling it?

The answer isn't in the economic pages; it's in the geopolitical ones.¬†The US is tolerating this internal economic cannibalism because it believes it's a necessary sacrifice to win the external war against China for AI supremacy.

The trade war with China was never really about tariffs or trade deficits. That was the¬†Juego Finito¬†(the finite game) for the headlines. The real¬†Juego Infinito¬†(the infinite game) is the race to develop and deploy artificial general intelligence. From the perspective of the US national security establishment, losing this race is an existential threat.

In this context, the AI bubble is not a bug; it's a feature. It's a wartime mobilization of capital. The logic is brutal:

1. We need to build our AI infrastructure faster than China.
2. The fastest way to do that in a capitalist system is to create a speculative frenzy that pours trillions of dollars into the sector.
3. The ""collateral damage"" ‚Äì the hollowing out of the middle class, the death of the seedbed, the social misery ‚Äì is considered an acceptable price to pay to avoid being technologically surpassed by a strategic rival.

The strategy is:¬†Win the AI race at any cost, and then we'll figure out how to deal with the social wreckage later.

# The Million-Dollar Question

This brings us to the terrifying endgame. The dot-com bubble was just about overvalued stocks. This bubble is being inflated with the jobs and the future of the American middle class.

What happens when the bubble bursts? Or worse, what happens if the US sacrifices its own social cohesion to win this race, only to find that the AI it has built is a tool for greater control and inequality, not prosperity? What if they win the war against China, only to lose the war against themselves?",0,1754243968.0,economy,0,0.5,False

Two, after some time, it starts flashing a fast flash on all the buttons. We're now on our third one since February, and it's doing it now, too. 

Nesspresso has been great to deal with, sending us new ones, but this last one only lasted 3 weeks before it started acting up.  Has anyone else experienced this? It's rather frustrating and disappointing that this model keeps failing. ",1,1754243877.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False
1mgpsom,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1mgpsom/best_machine_for_me/,Best machine for me?,"Hi all, I'm a student who recently got back from Europe and really enjoyed the hotel room espresso machines. I'm a little overwhelmed by the options on the Nespresso website so I wanted to ask some experts here. What machine would be best for me?

I'm looking for something with:

* Speed and convenience - very quick to make (<1-2 minutes), water tank big enough that I don't have to refill often
* Quality - I want the espresso to taste good and smooth
* Affordability - Budget <$300 for the machine. I know the Nespresso pods aren't cheap, but I'll only have one espresso (maybe a double shot) per day. I'd like the option to use cheaper pods or home-ground beans if Nespresso pods end up costing too much. I'm hoping to spend $40-50/month or less on pods - is this realistic? 
* Size - I don't want it to take up a ton of counter space
* Materials - would prefer metal over plastic, at least in the parts that touch the espresso.
* Flexibility for the future - initially I'm just going to drink espresso straight. In the long run though, I want to be able to make lattes and cappuccinos.

I don't care so much about:

* Ability to froth milk - I drink it straight, and can buy a frothing system later for lattes/cappuccinos
* Stupid tech bells and whistles - I do not need any WiFi, bluetooth, iOS apps, etc. to brew my espresso unless they meaningfully improve the experience.
* Ability to make coffee - I primarily want espresso, *HOWEVER* if there's a machine in my budget that can also make coffee that would be nice.

Question:

* Initially I plan to drink straight espresso. But in the future I'd like to make cappuccinos and lattes. I can buy a milk frother separately, but is there anything I need to know about the Nespresso (brew settings, temperature, volume, height, etc) that I need to consider for this long-term?",1,1754243839.0,nespresso,1,1.0,False

Not sure if this is the right place to post.

I‚Äôll try and keep it short as I can.  I‚Äôm 26 M,  have struggled with my mental health immensely but only in certain aspects of life.  I know it sounds odd.  These are, my workplace and my social life,  two huge parts of life I know.

 I come from quite a privileged background and have always been surrounded by success,  be it friends getting strong exam results or earning top paying jobs, it was never me.  (Not sure if this matters so apologies in advance).  

Onto my struggles,  I have never been able to tie down a decent paying job.  I have seen a trend where if I am unhappy and stressed in my job my whole life comes crumbling down with it,  not by choice,  it just seems to be how my brain works unfortunately.  Cue eye rolls from readers ‚Äúsuck it up‚Äù.  I promise I would if I could.

My social life,  to put it simply I haven‚Äôt seen friends from school in about 5ish years.  Not for a coffee, drinks,  a match or anything.  Purely down to me by the way and it sucks.  I was a popular lad in school and had great friendships within my year group.  I get immense social anxiety from these situations but it‚Äôs only from these scenarios.  I gym regularly, am in good shape,  I have ‚Äúgym friends‚Äù.  If you were my gym or work friend you‚Äôd think I was a completely normal, confident bloke.  I‚Äôll get to the work bit.  It seems to be whenever the point of meeting people is to literally socialise I feel my stress is through the roof.  

My job now,  I work in a secondary school and am paid hourly, coaching sports, supervising students,  going on schools trips etc.  And I fuc‚Ä¶.. love it so much.  I have zero stress from my workplace but let‚Äôs face it I don‚Äôt earn much at all.  My yearly income is around 24k.  Old job was about 44k, wasn‚Äôt able to stay and was miserable.  I pay 600 eu rent a month.  Sure I don‚Äôt earn much, but for the first time in my life I‚Äôm not miserable and stressed in my job, I have ‚Äúwork friends‚Äù and I am pretty popular.  Just like the gym and at school many years ago.  But when the point of meeting people is to socialise,  I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it.  

It‚Äôs odd, being very happy in a job for the first time in my life,  but earning and saving barely anything.
.  I wish I could bring myself to see old friends and socialise, and maybe I will one day.  I just feel lost I guess, is what I am trying to say.  I don‚Äôt feel worthy of meeting anyone special because of what I earn and the situation I am in.  If you made it this far I really appreciate it.  Cheers guys

PS - During summer I work summer camps,  and I claim jobseekers on the shorter school breaks.  My family doesn‚Äôt really help me financially, nor do 
I expect them to.

Happy redditing

1mgps4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mgps4w/it_came_from_above/,"""It Came From Above""","TW: This was removed from the previous reddit community because it involves a child in danger. I promise it's nothing worth putting me on a list for.

  
*As I looked into the empty onyx eyes of the beast, I saw the deepest abyss harken back to me. Through the sparse rays of moonlight, I could tell that its hairs were erect. It was fully aware that I was there to kill it or it would kill me by the end of this night. I had no intention of leaving this forest without a souvenir of my venture. My muscles tensed as I lowered myself into a more defensive position. The veins in my arms bore from my skin as I gripped the blade in my hand tighter. The beast mirrored my form. Legs holding firm to the ground, body arched forward with arms protecting one of the most vital treasures in its body, the heart. We stood there. We watched each other‚Äôs movements, ready to strike at the sign of an attack. We were both playing the offensive, but that wasn‚Äôt going to work in either of our favor. The sharp crack of a twig drew my attention from my enemy for a mere fraction of a millisecond, but it was enough time for the beast to move. I could no longer see it but I could hear hurried claws make its way around me. I did a full turn just in time to have the beast claw at my arms and legs. I did my best to slash in its direction but the blade could only slice through the air. The smell of iron from my lost blood mixed in with the piney, earthy scent of the forest. I fell back in exhaustion but the creature was not tired. Defeat would no longer be an option if it persisted with such ferocity. With the last few ounces of adrenaline coursing through my system, I drove the blade into the gaping maw of the monster until I could go no further. It wrung its hands, bled onto my body, and fought against my shaking arms. But then it went quiet. Its breathing slowed to desperate pants, then stopped altogether. Its heavy body slumped over mine. And that's when I heard the most terrifying sound, unknown to the common man.* 

 ‚ÄúANNIKA WATKINS! I do recall asking that these stories were to be about what you did this summer, not some fantastical exaggerations from the mind of a fantastical dreamer.‚Äù 

‚ÄúBut this did happen, Mrs. Crowley.‚Äù Annika lifted one of the sleeves of her sweater. She revealed large, ghastly, healing gashes along the length of her forearm where her skin had been ripped open some time ago. ‚ÄúSee, I have the scars to prove it.‚Äù The class gasped in the fascination of the validity of her story but her teacher was not impressed. 

‚ÄúI doubt those were made by some monster.‚Äù 

Annika didn‚Äôt want to risk being held back at school any longer. She decided to just take her seat rather than face detention for ‚Äútalking back‚Äù again. While the next student drudged on about their lame summer skipping rocks or fishing, Annika looked at her wounds again. She remembered the dark woods. She remembered going on a short hike with one of her brothers. She only walked away from him for a second. She just wanted to get a good look at the stream full of small minnows and frogs. Before she knew it, she was attacked by a young wolf. Must have been its first hunt because she wasn‚Äôt hurt immediately. She tried screaming for help, but the wolf deafened her cries with its howl. Remembering the pocket knife she took off from her brother‚Äôs belt, she was aware that she couldn‚Äôt run. She had to stay there and fight it. After driving the knife into the young wolf, Annika heard the sound of a dense pack of wolves howling back towards the slain child. Her brother found her quickly, threw her over his shoulder, and left the woods. The scars were a reminder for her to always keep her guard up. 

Mrs. Crowley was a homely woman known for her affinity for cats but disdain for rowdy children. She had only become a teacher because her success with the other sex was about as realistic as the beast from Annika‚Äôs story. She loathed Annika and her stories. As well-spoken as the ten-year-old was, she had an unquenchable desire to write macabre fictional stories. They were never set in reality, much like the girl herself. Annika was a daydreamer. If she wasn‚Äôt writing, her mind would take her through the window, outside of the classroom, away from the school to a darkened world of blood, sinew, and viscera. Her dark worlds were not completely hopeless; there was always the inclusion of a young heroine or hero who slew savage monsters, therefore cleansing the world from the horror. 

Who could blame such a young girl for a mind like that? 

The Watkins were free thinkers. Liberals who allowed such a young, impressionable mind to watch horror movies until the wax of candles burned out. Her only friends were her even more rowdy older siblings, who would roughhouse with her when the chance arose. For the most part, Annika would find herself alone. She would play along the forest line, where the acres of her family‚Äôs land greeted the black, isolated coniferous trees. In her dominant hand, she held a make-shift dagger made from cardboard, paint, and other decorative craft supplies as she fought against the unseen enemy. Of course, she would have to write this victorious tale of violence when given the next opportunity in class. 

It was a long way from the bus stop to the Watkins' residence. Annika trekked through woods and a dirt runway for a half-mile until her house stood right in front of her. It was a large two-story Victorian home at the head of their five-acre property. Swirling clouds overhead made the house darker than it usually appeared. A storm was coming. All Annika wanted now was to get some rest, along with a rousing fighting match against one of her brothers. 

Annika entered the doorway of her home, dragging her feet along the worn wooden flooring. Once her body had made its way completely inside, she crashed to the floor in defeat. She groaned loudly in the hopes that any of the other Watkins would hear her cry. But the house remained quiet. Still. She groaned again, louder this time, in case no one could hear her throughout the long halls. She sighed, accepting the reality that they must have been out hunting again. Without her. Again. She brought herself up from the frigid wood and began her ascension up to her room. She passed by the kitchen to her left. Empty. The living room, a little further up: empty. To her right were the hundred-year-old stairs with twelve grand steps that creaked and moaned as she continued to drag herself upward. By now, she had recognized the individual, despaired voices of the different steps along the staircase. She knew which voice represented which level and could tell how long she had until her parents would make it to the top floor before she had to pretend she was asleep every night. 

At last, she was at the top, tired from her day at school, she knew someone would wake her up in time for dinner. If they all weren‚Äôt camping out again that is. Her mom may have left a note, but she was too distracted by her slump to care. She continued down the long hallway till she reached her bedroom door at the furthest end. Above, she could see the entrance to the old attic before entering inside. A large bed made of solid redwood trees pushed along the right-most wall invited her in for a cozy slumber. She slung her backpack and jacket into her closet that faced the bed. It promptly landed on some clothes that she had meant to fold ages ago. Annika crashed her full body onto the bed. In the same fashion as she had done on the floor below. Without any more time to think, the young girl had succumbed to her exhaustion. 

The dangerous crack of lightning jolted the youngest family member out of her peaceful rest. Annika had a feeling that someone was home, hopefully with a delicious dinner prepared for her. She rose from her bed, happily making her way out of her room. 

She didn‚Äôt get far. 

She halted in her tracks, frozen in anxious curiosity. The attic door in front of her room had been propped open. The assisted ladder was out, barely touching the wood below. 

Could one of her family members be up there looking around? 

She was always cautioned that it was too dangerous for her to even consider going up there. This did not stop her. She took a hold of the rungs, making sure to quietly climb upward. The attic would have been pitch black had it not been for a few light sources crudely placed around the area; a small window allowing for the occasional bright flash of lightning, a small oil lantern in a corner slowly dimming away, and a small light coming from her bedroom leaking in from the berth of attic entrance. Next to the lantern, she could see something familiar; one of her dad‚Äôs old sleeping bags, littered with holes and a nonfunctioning zipper. Next to it were a few open cans of old food, fit with flies, filth, and fully rusted around the visible edges. That‚Äôs when the stench hit her. It was foul, rotten. An unearthly stench emanating from a coffee tin next to the bed. The smell of urine, ammonia, and death. Her head felt dizzy from the wafts of whatever was in the tin, her stomach swirled and ached as her brain urged her to leave the room. The stench caused her eyes to tear up, her nostrils burned; she stifled a few quiet coughs. 

Before Annika could make it back down the ladder, she heard footsteps approach. They weren‚Äôt as heavy as her dad‚Äôs or brothers‚Äô work boots, but they weren‚Äôt lighter than her mom‚Äôs house shoes either. They were different, hushed, calculated steps that seemed to be headed right towards her. In a panic, Annika made her way fully into the attic. She found an old chest fit with shards of broken glass from old picture frames, cobwebs, and a cloud of dense dust particles swirling around her irritated sinuses. Annika was short on better choices for hiding. She climbed into the chest, using a hole on the inside to peek through. She could still catch the smell of the musk and grime of the other person who brought himself into the attic behind her. She watched as he grabbed something from under the sleeping bag, then sat against the wall with the object in his hands. It caught some of the light from outside. The object looked metallic, one edge straight, while the other edge curved against the strange man‚Äôs finger. She recalled her mom telling her the story of squatters. Disturbed people who lived in old homes with a lot of space. They would steal food and sometimes hurt the homeowners if they ever found them out. 

Annika‚Äôs heart rapidly pumped as adrenaline coursed through her body. A burst of wind blew open the small window, providing enough distraction for Annika to jump out. Annika‚Äôs arms dripped with fresh blood from the broken shard in her forearm. One of her older scars had reopened. Without letting her injuries distract her, she made her way out of there and down the ladder. She could hear shuffling, some aggressive grunts, a few curses behind her. 

‚ÄúGet back here!‚Äù 

She hurriedly leaped off of the ladder and slammed it upwards to the attic to buy her some time. 

The young girl flew down the stairs, desperately searching around the whole bottom floor for anyone who could help, but the house stayed silent as a dormouse. 

She ran into the kitchen to find the house phone, as she picked it up to her ears she heard the dial tone, a voice on the other end saying something about a ‚Äúdisconnected service‚Äù. 

That‚Äôs when she saw it, a note on the fridge that either would damn her or help her in the end. 

***Went deer hunting by the mountains. We set our alarms to 10 p.m. so we will be back by 11.*** 

***Promise.*** 

***Love, Mom Dad Jason and Todd***

Annika looked up at the clock on the wall: 10:35. 

She may have not been good at math, but she knew that if she could survive for long enough, someone would be there to help her in the end. While she began thinking of a plan, she heard the haunting moans of the wailing staircase. 

Step 10. Thunder. Step 6. Thunder. Step 4. Silence‚Ä¶ 

Annika froze in a desperate hope to hear more, but she was met with just the raging storm outside. 

With quick wit, she grabbed one of her dad‚Äôs hunting knives from the counter. She took advantage of her small frame by quietly slipping into one of the cabinets above the sink. She knew that most creatures in the wild would search the low areas first. Now all she could do was wait. 

Finally, she could hear the footsteps again. The same, quiet footsteps as before. They made their way towards the kitchen first. As she predicted, the squatter searched the lower cabinets. His musty odor was more prominent than before as he got closer to the sink. She waited patiently. Her breath was steady. Any noise could mark trouble for her. 

When she heard the older body make its way through the kitchen into the dining room, she tried opening the door to the cabinet. 

In astute betrayal, the cabinet squeaked above the rolling thunder and she quickly jumped from the cabinet to the counter to the floor. Her small feet carried her back towards the staircase, up the cacophonous stairs. 

She reached her bedroom, desperately closing the door shut. Hurriedly, she hid in her closet under a pile of unfolded laundry. 

She was protected but cornered. 

She knew better than to jump out the window. A broken bone would not be to her advantage. But all of the furniture in her room was too heavy for her to move by herself. 

The thunder outside didn't cease. It boomed. Shaking the entire house with it. 

She could hear the squatter‚Äôs every move. 

Step 1. Thunder. Step 3 Thunder. Step 5. Silence‚Ä¶

He wasn't moving as quickly as before. She couldn‚Äôt hear his footfalls along the staircase anymore. Just the quiet of the house. 

Did he stop? Was he still coming up? Where was he now? 

The thunder got louder. Annika lost her hearing for a moment. She couldn‚Äôt hear her breath or her own heart. 

Thunder. 

Step 12. 

He was at the top of the stairs, heading straight down the hall. She held the knife close to her chest. 

*Daddy, please come home.* 

Her bedroom door swung open. In less than a second, the closet door to where she was hiding was openened too. 

She screamed. 

‚ÄúI got you‚Äù. 

He didn‚Äôt move any further, though. The glint of the blade in her hands caught his attention. She froze, too.  Quieting her shrieks to notice he also had his guard up. 

Another boom of thunder distracted them both. 

He quickly lunged at her but she was swift and small. She slipped past him, but he grabbed her leg. Pulling all of her weight to the floor. The air in her lungs had fully expelled. She turned onto her back. He lunged again. Annika drove the hunting knife forward. It went straight through his mouth, to the back of his throat. He thrashed, clawing at her and the knife. While he was down, Annika made her way out of the room and down the stairs again. 

She took the chance to run out the front door when she was blocked on her way out. 

It was soft, rain-soaked fabric that smelled of the surrounding forest, of fresh deer. 

She looked up to see her father before her. She held him close as she broke into hysterics about her encounter. The three men carefully went to her bedroom equipped with their rifles. 

Unlike Annika‚Äôs usual fibs, they felt more inclined to believe her tale. 

In a large puddle of viscous red was the man that Annika had described, a familiar hunting knife lodged in the center of his throat. And Annika was left with a new story for her class.",6,1754243805.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1mgpqto,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1mgpqto/christian_guilt/,Christian Guilt,"TLDR: Christian guilt, dealing with my mother who won‚Äôt let up and trying to break the generational trauma by not putting it on my kids who are young and impressionable. 

I feel the Christian guilt big time. I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt just let go of it and live my life. Am I being a bad person by stopping my kids from going to church? ‚ÄúLet the little children come to me‚Äù and all that. 

My mom recently started going to the church near us that my husband and I used to go to, but she doesn‚Äôt so much as attend, as she‚Äôs gotten herself involved with the children‚Äôs ministry. And I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd admit it but it seems like the sole purpose she‚Äôs done it is to get us, and particularly my children, going to church with the incentive of seeing Grandma. Her solution to everything is Jesus, God, praying and church and it drives me nuts. My husband has taken them several times and I‚Äôve been uncomfortable with it. Every week I get church induced anxiety when she asks them if they‚Äôre coming to church. When they don‚Äôt go I can tell she‚Äôs disappointed. When they do go, I have to hear what the kids have been learning in Sunday school and it doesn‚Äôt sit well with me. And I have to field the questions of why am I not going, which I suspect come through them from my mother. Kids are so impressionable and I don‚Äôt want to brainwash them into religion this young. But am I doing them a disservice or a service by keeping them completely away? 

My husband is still clinging to some scraps of his faith while I‚Äôve mostly let go of mine. I still believe in something out there but I can‚Äôt define what. And I don‚Äôt think I should have to. So he‚Äôs the one who has taken them. But I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt miss some of it. It‚Äôs been a great loss in my life and I‚Äôm not sure how to spiritually define myself these days. It was so deeply ingrained into my soul from infancy. 

I‚Äôve not told my mother any of this. She‚Äôs a die hard conservative evangelical and I feel it would shatter her world. I am her only child. We are all she has since she doesn‚Äôt get involved in much else. I have many issues with the evangelical church as of late, not withstanding control tactics of the last 40 years and involvement in politics, but I have issues specifically with our old church too, from several years ago. For being shady with many of their employees and not rectifying the situation. I do not trust pastors and those involved in ministry like I used to. 

The church is the typical ‚Äúopen and inviting‚Äù big nondenominational evangelical church, with casual attire, a coffee shop, a band, push for small groups, a large children‚Äôs program and a high turnover of attendees. And at its core it‚Äôs conservative in its beliefs. But my husband and I went there  for a fairly long time and I mourn the loss of it‚Ä¶mainly the community and good feels it gave me on the weekends. We even went on several global missions trips and volunteered a lot of our time to help out every week. 

But I can‚Äôt in good conscience really call myself a Christian anymore, and it makes me sad. It goes deeper than politics and HR mismanagement. At its core, Christianity fell apart for me when I actually allowed myself to take a good hard look at, after reading the whole Bible through and having more doubts than faith when all was said and done. So I took a step back, outside of it and I felt like my world opening up. And it was scary and it‚Äôs been a big adjustment. And it keeps evolving over time. But I have not had many people to talk about it with. The only difference between a cult and a religion is a religion is more established and well organized and recognized. But at its core, isn‚Äôt it still a cult? A very fractured one with many divisions and rules for each one. But ultimately the cult of Christ. 

Where do I go, what do I tell my mother and what do I teach my kids? I want them to be grounded in something, but I don‚Äôt want them to be in my position 3 decades from now when it all falls apart. Or worse, still sucked in and brainwashed by it all. But also, where can I find the community I‚Äôm missing?

This is a bit all over the place because I‚Äôve never taken the time to write it all down before. But it‚Äôs coming to a head with my mom and something needs to be done. It‚Äôs interfering with my mental health too much. This morning my son was super upset, shaking and crying because we didn‚Äôt take him to church to see grandma.

I have a kingrinder k6 atm, I believe it‚Äôs good for espresso as well.

See good things about flair, but they have different models. Since I know very little, the differences do not mean much to me. Should I go for the classic or pro 3, the price differs a lot and I‚Äôm not entirely sure if it‚Äôs worth it. Then I was looking at how to make milk drinks. It looks like steamers are the way to go, but what should I get for that. I could get a separate steamer but I‚Äôm finding recommendations that are quite expensive, is a steamer really ‚Ç¨150?

Getting a flair + steamer isn‚Äôt as cheap as I though, am I better of getting an all in one machine like the bambino? I see it‚Äôs a good beginner machine. I like the ritual of making a coffee in my v60. I drink coffee once a day, sometimes not even one. So the manual side of a flair spoke to me.

I‚Äôm a bit lost in what I need to get and where to spend my money. Any recommendations are welcome, also other brands for example. Budget is not set in stone.

1mgpnk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mgpnk4/explore_if_the_best_food_processor_ninja_bn801/,Explore if the Best Food Processor Ninja BN801 Lives Up to the Hype,"Ninja BN801 ‚Äì an impressive multifunctional kitchen system that offers versatility, power, and, well... a lot of cups. The moment I unboxed it, I was struck by how solid and modern it looked in its sleek grey design. It came with a 72-oz Total Crushing Pitcher, a 64-oz processor bowl, two 24-ounce to-go cups with lids, and about a million blades (okay, maybe just a handful, but it felt like a lot!). I have been using this kitchen gadget on a daily basis, and it has been a mix of awe and nitpicky annoyance.

**Unboxing Experience and Design**  
The packaging made everything look like a professional chef‚Äôs dream. After setting up all the components, the first thing I noticed was how tall it stood on my counter. Measuring 18 inches high, it‚Äôs something to keep in mind if your kitchen cabinets hover low. Aside from that, the grey finish complements modern kitchen aesthetics beautifully. Every part‚Äîfrom the motor base to the attachments‚Äîseemed durable. The stainless-steel blades in particular gave a promising glint of long-term sharpness (and a slight scare while washing).  

**Ease of Use with Auto-iQ**  
Using this kitchen system daily felt incredibly intuitive, thanks to the Auto-iQ technology. The pre-set programs‚Äîsmoothies, frozen drinks, nutrient extraction, chopping, and dough‚Äîtook out the guesswork. I loved the pulsing and pausing mechanisms in these programs. For instance, making smoothies? Just press a button, and the machine handles it like a pro. But, there‚Äôs a downside. These programs aren‚Äôt adjustable, so if you're someone who loves fine-tuning settings, it might feel restrictive.

**Check [Ninja BN801](https://gogeary.com/p/b08559k7cn/) price on Amazon.**

**Performance and Power**  
One word: beastly. This machine‚Äôs 1400-peak-watt motor lets those Total Crushing Blades tackle ice, frozen fruits, and even tough kale stems like a bulldozer. The crushing pitcher was especially useful for making smoothies, margaritas, and homemade slushies. Ever tried blending bulletproof coffee with ice? It nailed the texture on the first try. However, I noticed it‚Äôs LOUD. It‚Äôs like having a tiny plane take off in the kitchen‚Äînot ideal for early mornings when others are sleeping.

**Positives**  
- Powerful motor handles tough ingredients effortlessly.  
- Pre-set Auto-iQ functions make blending worry-free.  
- Large, family-friendly batches thanks to the 72-oz pitcher.
- On-the-go convenience with the to-go cups.  
- Multipurpose design that moves seamlessly between blending, chopping, and dough-making.  

**Food Processing Function**  
The 8-cup processor bowl turned out to be more of a hero in my kitchen than expected. From making cookie dough in under 60 seconds to dicing onions without shedding a tear, it felt like a sous chef had come to life. The torque of the dough blades impressed me while kneading pizza dough‚Äîtwo pounds of dough came together in just half a minute. That said, the bowl‚Äôs capacity cap at 64 oz makes me wonder if those with larger families would need to process in multiple cycles.

**Negatives**  
- Very noisy during operation.  
- Can occupy significant counter space.  
- The non-adjustable presets might not suit custom recipes.  
- Cleaning the stacked blade assembly requires extra care.  

**Blades and Attachments Overview**  
Every attachment served its purpose flawlessly. The Pro Extractor Blades in the cups were fantastic for single-person portions, blending smoothies smooth enough to pour straight into the cup, no strainer needed. Meanwhile, the stacked blade assembly in the large pitcher crushed through frozen ingredients amazingly. Cleaning them, though, tested my patience. Some debris tends to lodge in the nooks, making a bottle brush necessary unless you want remnants of last night‚Äôs smoothie haunting today‚Äôs blend.

**Product Competitors**  
Comparing this kitchen system to the Vitamix E310: the Ninja BN801 wins on versatility and attachments. Vitamix offers incredible blending, but it lacks the food processing prowess and dough-making ease that the Ninja provides. Against a NutriBullet RX, it‚Äôs less compact but undeniably more powerful. However, noise-wise, both the Ninja and Vitamix tend to roar, while NutriBullet runs slightly quieter‚Äîsomething to consider if noise matters.

**Quality for Price**  
For its feature set, this kitchen system seems fair in its category. It combines a blender, food processor, and dough maker‚Äîall in one program-powered beast. Buying each of these separately would cost far more. That said, it isn‚Äôt budget-friendly for everyone, and the noise might make you second-guess investing if your mornings prioritize quiet over crushed ice.

I have not talked to my sponsor yet, she has come up to me about 2 weeks ago and told me to email her so she can have my contact information even though I‚Äôm pretty sure the director of the ocia program has already given her, no big deal I‚Äôm okay. I email her still haven‚Äôt heard back it‚Äôs been a couple weeks now. I see her at church every week but I get there early and use that time to myself and then even at coffee afterwards she‚Äôs said hi but hasn‚Äôt sat down and tried to talk to me. I‚Äôm not even upset about that it‚Äôll happen when it happens. But I say that to say this, more often than not, the ocia class is me and about 3 other people, I am not learning anything. Today they were asking me on a scale of 1-10 how close to god are we. Or ‚Äúhow did this verse/homily/gospel make you feel‚Äù. Valid questions but it makes up the entire session. Obviously the spiritual and feelings part of this is very relevant. Our Eucharist lesson was cut short weeks ago didn‚Äôt get to see or look at the tabernacle or host or even learn what it was because we got stuck on how does this make you feel. I feel like I am learning more from apps like ascension and amen or even just random YouTube videos than I am in person. Is it normal for ocia to feel like a therapy session ?? I feel like some of the discussion we have about feelings and questions that feel like therapy could or should be coming from my sponsor so that the actual class time is spent learning the catechism or Bible study? I guess I just want to know am I over reacting or is this normal and I just need to calm down. I do plan on talking to the head honcho of the program about it he‚Äôs very easy to talk to and tbh the only reason I haven‚Äôt say is anything yet  is because I don‚Äôt know if I am over reacting and maybe just frustrated and I don‚Äôt want to be mean about it. Because today I left class early and started crying in my car because I just don‚Äôt understand like what we were even talking about in class, today it was about vanity and ecclesiastes, I still am lost on what we were supposed to take away from this because the only thing the teacher was saying was, ‚Äúwhat did you take from this, on a scale of 1-10 how much do you think you can obey god?‚Äù Like what ?? I don‚Äôt know what I took from it I am looking to you in this classroom to do more than read it out loud one time and then ask me what it means to me before we have even discussed it or what it‚Äôs even about.

* Spread vs on-chain fee: The price was roughly spot +1.8 %, which beats some card FX rates, yet the miner fee that day nudged the total higher than a debit card would have.
* Liquidity risk: They auto-convert to local currency on their end, so I didn‚Äôt chase a buyer, but I wonder how sustainable that is if BTC drops 10 % mid-flight.

1mgplvk,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1mgplvk/lattissima_machine_stopped_working_and_the/,Lattissima machine stopped working and the response from Nespresso customer support is wild,"So, I'm going to preface this by saying I realize there's probably a language thing happening here *and* that I'm not really expecting Nespresso to do anything for me. I decided to chat with them just to try my luck to see if there was anything they'd be able to do, like order a replacement part with a discount or whatever. In the end, they offered a 35% discount off a full price of a machine, so I think I'm going to end up going with that.

My Lattissima Pro by DeLonghi has started acting up lately (ironically, after a de-scaling, though I'm not sure if it's not just coincidence). I'm not a fan of how disposable kitchen appliances have become, where they cease to function the next day they're out of warranty, but this little guy has been a faithful servant to my wife's three-a-day latte habit for the better part of the last five years. About two months ago, it decided it'd had enough of us and the milk frother started spitting out warm water instead of milk if I try to make consecutive cups. The odd thing is that it works fine for the first cup of the day, but if I want to make one for myself immediately after making one for my better half, I'm out of luck. If I let it sit for about an hour, it's back to good, but I still can't make two in a row. I've read some info on Reddit about cleaning bits and pieces and have tried to do so, but, by and large, it's not working for me. The pump just doesn't seem to be drawing milk in to the spigot.

Literally nothing has changed in our five years of ownership - we still use the same brand of milk, we still clean the machine according to the same process as the manual prescribes. We've been as good to the machine as it's been to us.

I chatted with customer support and they had me take a video of what was happening. Fair enough, did that, struggled to get it under 10 MB in size so that it could get uploaded to their chat, but ended up figuring it out in the end. This is the conversation that then transpired (after all the formalities had been taken care of and we had figured out it'd had been descaled with the Nespresso descaling kit):

**Agent:** Understood! Outside of using the Latte Macchiato and Cappuccino brew options, are you able to brew a regular Lungo or Espresso cup of coffee?

**Me:** Yes.

**Agent:** Understood! Based on the resources available for your machine model, the Cappuccino and Latte Macchiato functions have been deactivated. 

**Me:** I'm sorry, I don't follow. They haven't been deactivated. They work. They just don't work every time.

**Agent:** Your Lattissima Pro machine has been discontinued, and it is noted that the Instant Brew recipe button is not functional because this feature has been officially deactivated. This deactivation would not affect the Lungo and Espresso coffee options.

**Me:** I'm sorry, what? How could they have been deactivated by the fact that you have stopped selling it?

**Agent:** I do understand your concerns and that is normal seeing that the function is one that is deactivated. I am unable to provide information on why the feature was deactivated or why the machine has been discontinued. However, based on my resources, it is noted that this function has been deactivated, and it is therefore normal for it not to work as expected.

So, there you have it. Nespresso has stopped carrying this machine, so, apparently, the latte/cappuccino function that works about half the time has, in fact, been ""deactivated"". I'm not even sure how to formulate a response, if I'm being honest. To give our steampunk overlords the benefit of the doubt, usually, when something ""deactivates"", it's not triggered by a store stopping to carry a model and even if so, how would the machine even know without being connected to the Internet?

Has anyone dealt with a similar issue (or interaction with customer service) before? Is my best bet here to take their 35% discount offer and grab another machine? The Lattissima One seems to be the most similar and affordable for our intents and purposes, and the Nespresso price after the discount is lower than Amazon's. Or can ours still be salvaged?",0,1754243413.0,nespresso,2,0.5,False

I'm constantly paranoid and I hallucinate a lot but as long as I'm around other people I'm able to be completely lucid and function fine. My symptoms aren't affecting my performance at work or really my social and personal relationships all that much but I feel like I'm in hell. 

The hallucinations are making me feel like I can't trust my perception of anything. People call my name IRL and I ignore it because of the amount of voices I hear calling my name. When people ask why I didn't respond to them calling for me I say I didn't hear them. 

I hallucinated cockroaches crawling all over me the other night and I got out of bed frantically telling my parents that there were roaches in my bed and when they checked there was absolutely nothing there. That was the moment when I realized that even though I'm able to pretty quickly brush off the delusions or voices  I experience and act normal I really have no idea if what I'm perceiving to be real is real, if certain experiences or thoughts I'm having are just paranoia etc.

I see my doctor tomorrow and I'll have to tell him the extent from which I've disconnected from reality even though I didn't realize it for who knows how long because I'm still a fully functional human. I think I've just been thinking things like oh I'm just having anxiety and a phobia of the dark (even though at this point the hallucinations and paranoia have been just as bad with all the lights on) and not wanting to think about the fact that I might be resistant to my current meds. 

I also just got totally sober about a month ago, and even when I wasn't sober I never did drugs. I smoked weed one time and it sent me into full blown psychosis so I never did it again. I know that it's not drug induced. I still vape nicotine (which my doctor said was OK to do on olanzapine) and have coffee but those are the only things I have been indulging in and the problem seems to be getting worse over time, not better. 

For the past 4 years I've been on olanzapine and will periodically increase my dose and then go back down because the side effects are way too much. Before that I was on risperdal for about a year or so and it just didn't work at all. My doctor keeps suggesting clozapine but I always decline because of the blood draws and just general fear of it.

TL;DR I didn't realize how bad my symptoms have become until recently and am scared to try clozapine even though my doctor has been saying for over a year that may fix it. If you have experience with clozapine please share! ",1,1754243334.0,schizophrenia,1,1.0,False

Today, with a heavy heart and an even heavier sigh of relief, I cancelled my Replit subscription.

For the last two weeks, I've been on a journey. A journey to see if I could get the AI to build a reasonably complex application. I wasn't just whispering sweet nothings into the prompt box; I was giving it instructions so detailed they could have passed as a legal contract. I specified Python libraries, versions, and even walked it through error handling like a fourth-year CS student.

At one point, thinking I'd make it impossibly easy, I slipped it the ultimate cheat sheet: the *entire source code* of a working version of the app, just in a different programming language. I thought, ""Surely, this is just a translation job now, right?""

Apparently, a lot gets lost in translation.

Despite my best efforts, extensive debugging, and providing a literal blueprint, the final product was something that looked vaguely like my application, but with the structural integrity of a chocolate teapot. It was riddled with glaring, fundamental errors that no amount of prompt-massaging could fix.

Look, I'm not just here to throw shade. I genuinely think the potential is huge. But if Replit wants to graduate from ""cool weekend project generator"" to ""indispensable professional tool,"" it really needs to beef up its ability to handle complex, enterprise-grade applications. The AI needs to be able to build a skyscraper, not just a very confident, very broken LEGO house.

Anyway, that's just my two cents from my two weeks of pain. Your mileage may vary, and if you've managed to build a fully-fledged Skynet with it, I salute you and genuinely want to know your secrets.

With my counters already crammed with gadgets and appliances, anything that boasts a smaller footprint is a welcome addition. This brushed stainless steel countertop oven promised not only convenience but also smart technology, and honestly, it lived up to much of the hype. Let me dive into the details.

**Compact Design for Limited Counter Space**  
Right out of the box, this oven struck me as sleek and modern. It's not just about aesthetics though; the compact dimensions (W17 x D15.5 x H10.25 inches) mean it can slip into even crowded kitchens without hogging too much real estate. I placed it snugly between my coffee machine and blender, and it fit perfectly without feeling overwhelming. The brushed stainless steel finish gives it a premium vibe, though fingerprints can occasionally mar its surface‚Äîeasy enough to wipe off, but worth mentioning.

**Cooking Performance That Impresses**  
Using this oven for the past month has been a game-changer in my kitchen. The compact interior still managed to accommodate most of my baking dishes and trays, and it easily fit a 12-inch pizza. My Saturday experiment with a roast chicken? Flawless results. The Element IQ smart sensor technology definitely seems to work as advertised, automatically adjusting power distribution for consistent cooking. Whether baking cookies, roasting vegetables, or preparing crispy toast, the results were even and satisfying.

[Check Breville BOV650XL price on Amazon.](https://heatad.com/t/b00357ys3a/)

**User-Friendly Interface**  
I‚Äôm someone who detests overly complicated interfaces, and this oven‚Äôs simple knob controls and backlit LCD immediately won me over. The eight pre-set cooking functions‚Äîranging from Toast to Bake to Reheat‚Äîmade it easy to whip up meals without second-guessing. I particularly appreciated how manually set temperatures and times could be saved for future reference. The backlit screen changes color, too‚Äîorange during cooking and blue once done, which is a nifty little feature. 

**Key Perks**  
- Compact size but adequately spacious for most cooking needs.  
- Smart sensor technology ensures even cooking results.  
- An intuitive control panel that‚Äôs beginner-friendly.  
- Backlit LCD screen that‚Äôs both functional and stylish.  

**Shortcomings**  
- No internal light, which makes checking on food mid-cook a bit tricky.  
- After prolonged use, it does emit some heat on the exterior, so keep it away from sensitive gadgets.  
- The ticking sound of the timer might not bother everyone but felt a bit distracting to me.  

**Alternative Offerings**  
While this oven impressed me, I‚Äôve also tried a few similar models in this range. The Panasonic FlashXpress toaster oven matches this one in ease of use but feels slightly less robust in terms of build quality. Meanwhile, Cuisinart's Convection Toaster Oven provides additional baking space and true convection cooking, making it a better choice if you frequently prepare larger meals. However, the Breville BOV650XL stands out for its smart Element IQ technology and a simple, fuss-free design. All things considered, it slides comfortably ahead of its competitors, especially for small households or those tight on counter space.

**True Value**  
Considering its features and performance, I‚Äôd say this oven is well worth its price for users who need efficiency paired with versatility. It‚Äôs a great investment if you‚Äôre upgrading from a basic toaster oven or if your cooking needs revolve around small to medium-sized meals. I appreciated not having to reheat my full-sized oven constantly, saving both electricity and effort‚Äîa win for the environment and for my utility bill.

1mgpgp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetReviewHub/comments/1mgpgp5/explore_why_the_microsoft_surface_pro_11_review/,Explore Why the Microsoft Surface Pro 11 Review Highlights Productivity and Features,"The Microsoft Surface Pro 11 Surface Pro 11 instantly caught my attention with its sleek, minimalist design and the promise of a tablet that doubles as a powerful Windows 11-powered PC. I‚Äôve been using this device for a while now as part of my daily work and commute routine, and it‚Äôs safe to say there‚Äôs quite a bit to unpack here. From its processor to its stunning display and thoughtful accessories, it has both impressed and raised a few eyebrows.

**Design: A Slim and Lightweight Marvel**  
The first thing I noticed when pulling the tablet out of its box was how ridiculously light and slim it is. Clocking in at about 1.97 lbs and with a thickness of just 0.37 inches, it‚Äôs genuinely portable and slips easily into my backpack without making a dent on my shoulder. Its black finish looks all business and screams sophistication. The detachability of the keyboard is a game-changer‚Äîat times, I use it as a laptop, and other times, it becomes the perfect entertainment hub. The Surface Slim Pen snugly recharges within the keyboard, which is a neat touch because I constantly misplace my styluses otherwise. If your work involves attending business meetings or impromptu sketching on the go, this design feels like it‚Äôs made to cater.

**Performance: Impressively Nimble (With the Snapdragon X Plus)**  
I‚Äôve always been wary of non-Intel or non-AMD processors, but the Snapdragon X Plus (10-core) processor running this device changed my mind. Day-to-day tasks like browsing the web with multiple tabs, running Office apps, and even light photo editing on Adobe Lightroom didn‚Äôt show any noticeable lag. The Copilot feature, conveniently accessible via its dedicated button, has become my new favorite assistant. Whether summarizing notes, scheduling meetings, or even generating content ideas, the AI-coordinated productivity boost is fantastic for multitaskers like me.  

[Want Microsoft Surface Pro 11? Discover the price on Amazon.](https://usegadgets.com/p/b0dlf5h653/)  

While it‚Äôs not built for gaming or power-intensive tasks like 4K video editing, the Qualcomm Adreno Integrated GPU comfortably handled casual games and streaming in high definition. The speed, paired with its efficient power consumption, ensures long battery life. My experience backed this up‚Äîon lighter workdays, the battery life easily stretched close to two full workdays, reducing my dependency on frequent recharges.

**Display: Visuals That Pop**  
Whenever colleagues saw me using the tablet, they couldn‚Äôt help but gush over its display. With a 13-inch PixelSense Flow touchscreen, boasting a crisp 2880 x 1920 resolution and a buttery-smooth 120Hz refresh rate, everything from spreadsheets to Netflix looks stunning. Bright, punchy colors and a 1200:1 contrast ratio mean it‚Äôs not just sharp but vibrant too. Scrolling feels seamless, and gestures, along with Surface Pen capabilities, make using this screen genuinely immersive. During my weekend hobbies, like sketching and digital art, the screen responsiveness made doodling a breeze.

**Advantages**  
- Gorgeous, lightweight design perfect for portability.  
- Integrated 13-inch PixelSense Flow display that‚Äôs super sharp and fluid.  
- Business-ready AI-powered camera with Studio effects.  
- Snapdragon X Plus processor efficient enough for most tasks.  

**Limitations**  
- The lightweight keyboard is a bit wobbly when using it on your lap.  
- It's not quite as powerful as some laptops for intensive computing.  

**Connectivity: Modern Expectations Met**  
I appreciated having USB-C ports but found myself secretly wishing for one USB-A port to connect some of my older accessories. Thankfully, Wi-Fi 6 support compensates for this by delivering blazing-fast and reliable wireless speeds. During some online conferences in bustling coffee shops with weak networks, the tablet held its ground better than my previous laptop.

**Other Options: How It Stacks Up Against Rivals**  
Compared to similar products like Apple‚Äôs iPad Pro and Lenovo‚Äôs Yoga Duet, the Surface Pro 11 carves out its niche. The PixelSense display is miles ahead of Lenovo‚Äôs Yoga when it comes to fluidity and resolution. Meanwhile, while the iPad Pro‚Äôs M2 chip slightly outclasses the Snapdragon X Plus in raw performance, the fact that the Surface Pro 11 runs a full-fledged Windows 11 Pro OS gives it an advantage for productivity workflows. Additionally, the Surface Slim Pen‚Äôs built-in recharge capability outshines Apple‚Äôs separate charging dock for the Apple Pencil, making this a win for Microsoft on the accessory front.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given the unique Copilot feature, multiple functionalities, and premium aesthetics, this tablet seems like a smart long-term investment. While it may not be cheap, it does bring together the portability of a top-tier tablet and the productivity of a business-class laptop into one package. You no longer have to choose between quality and functionality when this device offers a middle ground.

1mgpgj7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subliminal/comments/1mgpgj7/how_i_rebuilt_my_life_from_rock_bottom_to/,How I rebuilt my life from rock bottom to discipline and emotional resilience in 6 months,"Six months ago, I was the definition of a mess. Waking up at 3pm, eating junk food in bed, doom scrolling until 5am. My room looked like a tornado hit it. I was basically a human sloth surviving on study loans while ignoring my classes completely. This went on for months until I realized I had to change my life or I'd be stuck forever.

TLDR: Start reading non-fiction daily and apply what you learn. Build the habit on willpower, not motivation. Use modern tools to make reading addictive. Your brain will literally rewire itself.

# HABIT BUILDING

The game changer for me was reading ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building habits. Clear breaks down the science of why we fail and gives you a bulletproof system that actually works.

The biggest mistake I made at first was relying on motivation. I'd get hyped up, promise myself I'd read for 2 hours daily, then crash and burn after 3 days. Motivation is like weather, it comes and goes. You can't build your life on something that unstable.

The solution is willpower plus stupidly small requirements. Instead of ""I'll read 50 pages because I'm motivated,"" say ""I'll force myself to read 1 page because I have enough willpower for that."" Make it so small you can't fail.

Here's the psychology behind why this works. Once you sit down with the book and read that one page, you'll usually keep going. Your brain doesn't want to stop once it's started. But if you set a huge goal and feel overwhelmed, you won't even start.

Try it right now. Go grab any book and read one page. I guarantee you have the willpower for that.

# READING

This is where the magic happened for me. Reading non-fiction daily was the one habit that changed everything else. I got an e-reader and started carrying it everywhere. Public transport, waiting in lines, before bed, it became my default activity.

The benefits hit different when you experience them yourself. You're learning directly from the smartest people who ever lived. Einstein, Marcus Aurelius, Maya Angelou, they're all waiting on your bookshelf. There are books on literally anything you find interesting.

But here's what most people don't realize about reading. It rewires your brain. When you read, you create new neural pathways. You're upgrading your mental operating system every single day. After six months of consistent reading, I feel like I have access to hundreds of brilliant minds.

Books that completely changed my perspective: ""The Willpower Instinct"" by Kelly McGonigal (Stanford psychologist who breaks down the science of self-control), ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the psychology of optimal experience), and ""Meet Your Happy Chemicals"" by Loretta Breuning (how your brain chemicals actually work).

I've tried everything to make reading more accessible and addictive. Physical books are great but since I got my new job in banking I seldom have time to read full books. My friend put me onto a smart reading tool called BeFreed that turns books into engaging and personalized podcasts. It lets you pick how deep you want to go, 10/20 min summaries, or full 40-min deep dives. You can customize your own reading host‚Äôs voice & tone (mine has a smoky voice like Samantha). It also builds a learning roadmap for you based on your life, struggles, goals, and how your brain works. I use it to crush books on discipline, psychology, and even investing, while walking or making coffee. I honestly never thought I‚Äôd be addicted to reading. But it gives me the same dopamine as scrolling, and now I‚Äôve replaced TikTok with knowledge. Essential sources for any lifelong learner.¬†

I also use Fable to track my reading, discover new books, and stay motivated through the community. For me, the goal is to remove every barrier to consuming knowledge.

The compound effect is insane. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Concepts from one book connect to ideas in another. You start seeing patterns everywhere. Your conversations get deeper. Your problem-solving improves. Friends notice you're giving better advice.

# DOPAMINE AND BRAIN CHEMISTRY

This part blew my mind when I learned about it. Most people think dopamine equals pleasure, but that's wrong. Dopamine is actually about wanting and motivation. It's what drives you to seek rewards.

Here's the problem. Social media, Netflix, junk food, they all give massive dopamine hits. Way more than anything in nature ever would. Your brain gets addicted to these super-stimuli. When you're constantly getting these artificial highs, normal activities feel boring.

Reading trains your brain to focus on one thing for extended periods. It's like meditation but you're also gaining knowledge. You're teaching your dopamine system to find satisfaction in learning and growth instead of mindless consumption.

After a few weeks of consistent reading, I noticed my attention span improving. I could focus longer on tasks. The constant need to check my phone decreased. Reading became my replacement for doom scrolling.

# FLOW STATES

One book that changed how I think about activities is ""Flow"" by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Flow is when you're completely absorbed in an activity. You lose track of time. You forget about yourself. You're just present with the task.

Reading creates natural flow states. When you're deep in a good book, hours feel like minutes. This is your brain operating at peak performance. You're not distracted or scattered. You're fully engaged.

The difference between pleasure and enjoyment hit me hard. Pleasure activities give you dopamine but don't make you grow. Scrolling TikTok is pleasurable but empty. Reading is enjoyable because it challenges you and makes you better.

I started filling my days with more flow activities. Reading, learning guitar, having deep conversations. These activities are harder than passive entertainment but infinitely more rewarding.

# PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION

Start tonight with one page. Any book that interests you. Self-help, fiction, biography, doesn't matter. The goal is building the habit first.

Keep a book or e-reader visible somewhere you'll see it daily. I put mine next to my coffee maker so I'd see it every morning.

Replace one mindless activity with reading. Instead of scrolling while you eat breakfast, read. Instead of watching random YouTube videos before bed, read.

Track your progress somehow. I use a simple habit tracker tool. Seeing the streak build up becomes addictive.

Join online communities about reading. Reddit has amazing book communities. Goodreads helps you discover new books and track what you've read.

The crazy part is that six months ago, I thought people who read regularly were just naturally disciplined. Now I realize discipline is just a habit you build one page at a time. Reading taught me that I'm not broken or lazy. I just needed better systems and knowledge about how my brain actually works.

Anyone can do this. You don't need special talent or motivation. You just need to start ridiculously small and be consistent. Your future self will thank you for starting today.",1,1754243068.0,Subliminal,1,1.0,False

had a coffee chat with the CEO a few days ago and followed up afterwards-he even replied saying I could reach out if I had further questions.

During our conversation, he asked about my strengths, which really made me reflect on how I want to develop my skills and shape my career in compliance.

1mgp82i,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1mgp82i/does_thang_long_vietnamese_coffee_filter_deliver/,Does Thang Long Vietnamese Coffee Filter Deliver Top Brewing Results Review,"The Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 Vietnamese Coffee Filter has earned a special place on my kitchen counter. Known also as a Vietnamese Coffee Maker or Press, this compact gem delivers the charm of authentic Vietnamese coffee right at home. With sturdy stainless steel and a minimalistic design, it seems to promise both durability and efficiency. Testing it daily over the course of two weeks, I‚Äôve brewed cups of perfect caf√© sua da without needing a major learning curve. 

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
As a coffee enthusiast, I‚Äôm always keen on how a product feels in hand, and this filter didn‚Äôt disappoint. Made from high-quality stainless steel, it feels solid yet lightweight at just 4.4 ounces. The clean metallic finish adds a modern aesthetic to any kitchen setup. The dimensions, standing at 3.7‚Äù x 3.7‚Äù x 2.6‚Äù, make it ridiculously compact‚Äîit‚Äôs easy to store, pack, or travel with. The simplistic four-piece assembly ensures that disassembly for cleaning is fast and frustration-free. However, the compact size does limit it to an 8-ounce serving, which might feel restrictive for those who prefer larger batches.  

**Ease of Use with Gravity Insert Mechanism**  
What impressed me most was the filter‚Äôs gravity insert, which beats the fussiness of old-school screw-down filters. If you‚Äôre like me and value time in the mornings, this detail streamlines the brewing process. Simply add coffee grounds, pour hot water, and let it drip‚Ä¶ patience is all you need now. It works seamlessly with Vietnamese coffee brands like Trung Nguyen, delivering the signature nutty and chocolatey taste profile that fans of this brew adore. For anyone new to the setup, pictorial instructions are provided, and I found the accompanying PDF from the brand particularly helpful.  

**Highlights**  
- Durable stainless steel with a sleek exterior finish  
- Gravity insert mechanism simplifies brewing, compared to screw-down types  
- Dishwasher-safe design for easy maintenance  
- Brews authentic, rich Vietnamese coffee for both hot and iced varieties  

[Check Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01953yt1i/)  

**Performance and Brewing Results**  
As someone who tests coffee makers regularly, I can confirm that this filter delivers a smooth and consistent brew every single time. The slow-drip mechanism ensures maximum extraction of flavorful oils in roughly 5-7 minutes. It‚Äôs not just a coffee maker‚Äîit‚Äôs an experience that demands a bit of patience but rewards you with coffee that feels crafted, not rushed. The filter shines brightest when paired with medium-to-coarse grounds. However, I did find that ultra-fine grounds caused slower dripping, which may be ideal for some but less so for those craving speedier results.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Limited capacity of 8 ounces; not ideal for multiple servings  
- Doesn‚Äôt come with a specific storage pouch, making it susceptible to scratches if handled carelessly  
- Slower drip speed with finer grounds  

**Who Is It Best Suited For?**  
This coffee filter caters predominantly to solo coffee drinkers or individuals who value artistry in their brewing process. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone dipping into the world of Vietnamese coffee, particularly lovers of caf√© sua da. For households wanting quick, bulk servings of coffee, however, this manual setup might not be the best fit.  

**Competing Brands**  
While exploring similar products, I found options like the Trung Nguyen Vietnamese Coffee Filter and the GG Vietnamese Coffee Press. While the Trung Nguyen filter is equally robust and carries a similar price tag, it uses a traditional screw-down mechanism, which some may find cumbersome compared to this product's gravity insert. The GG Press, though slightly larger in capacity, sacrifices some of the compactness and portability that makes the Thang Long filter appealing. In terms of durability and ease of use, the Thang Long SYNCHKG077062 definitely has the edge.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Discussing its value proposition, this filter falls into the ‚Äúaffordable quality‚Äù segment, offering a wholesome brewing experience without burning a hole in your wallet. Its lifetime warranty further underscores its durability. Cheaper options are available online, but their build and performance pale in comparison. More expensive options, on the other hand, rarely bring enough unique features to outweigh the added cost.

*Where underdogs rise, souffl√©s fall, and Dylan Cease‚Äôs job security is a rollercoaster*

---

**1. Parse the Odds: A Math Class You Won‚Äôt Regret**  
The San Diego Padres are the 62.5% favorite to win this game (decimal odds: 1.51), while the St. Louis Cardinals are the 27.8% underdog (odds: 2.66). The spread? Padres -1.5 (-200 to -216) and Cardinals +1.5 (+170 to +180). The total is set at 8 runs, with the Over priced at 1.93-2.0 and the Under at 1.82-1.88.

Let‚Äôs break this down:

* **Padres‚Äô Implied Probability**: 62.5% to win. Sounds solid, but their implied probability for the spread (-1.5) is only \~54% (based on -200 odds). That‚Äôs a 10% gap‚Äîbetting on favorites is a minefield.
* **Cardinals‚Äô Spark**: Their +1.5 spread line implies a 45% chance to cover, which feels generous given their recent 8-5 comeback win. But here‚Äôs the kicker: Andre Pallante, their starter, has looked like a chef who forgot to turn off the oven (his ERA since moving to the rotation? A flaming 5.72).

**Key Stat**: The Cardinals‚Äô offense just broke a 30-inning scoreless drought. They‚Äôre not just hungry‚Äîthey‚Äôre *starving*.

**2. Digest the News: Injuries, Motivation, and a Hitting Streak That Should Be Illegal**

* **Cardinals‚Äô Comeback Kids**: Masyn Winn and Pedro Pag√©s are the heroes of the hour, but let‚Äôs not forget Luis Arraez of the Padres, who‚Äôs on a 15-game hitting streak. That‚Äôs like a vegan in a steakhouse‚Äîunstoppable and slightly terrifying.
* **Padres‚Äô Starter Drama**: Dylan Cease, who was almost traded, is now ‚Äúexcited‚Äù to stay. Translation: He‚Äôll pitch like a man who just remembered he‚Äôs on a reality show‚Äîeither all-in or a complete disaster.
* **Pallante‚Äôs Struggles**: The Cardinals‚Äô starter has been a Jell-O shot of inconsistency. He‚Äôs allowed 5+ runs in 4 of his last 5 starts. If baseball had a ‚ÄúMost Likely to Spill Coffee on Your Keyboard‚Äù award, he‚Äôd be a shoo-in.

1mgozil,https://i.redd.it/ezh0ttjz9ugf1.jpeg,Willamette weekend recap,"We're heading home from a lovely weekend in Oregon and I thought I'd share some of our experiences.

Logistics
We stayed at the Compass in McMinnville, two blocks away from the main drag. It took a little more than an hour to get there from PDX. The Compass bills itself as a mix between a hotel and a b&b - the rooms are laid out like a b&b, and there are common areas downstairs, but there was no reception or anything. You had a code to get into the building and your room. We highly recommend it; everything seemed new and clean, our bathroom was enormous, and it was very convenient to just walk right in (especially after our flight delay had us arrive in the middle of the night). We'd definitely stay there again.

For transportation, we rented a car and had Dan from Main Street Drivers drive us around in our rental for our tastings. Not cheap, but way cheaper than a DUI. He was very nice and had some great suggestions. I came up with most of our itinerary, then he called me a few days before and helped streamline it. 

Both mornings we had the breakfast sandwiches from Union Block coffee shop. Very tasty and a great way to get a good base before we started drinking.

Wine
On day 1, we went south from McMinnville to the Eola-Amity Hills area. We did:

Evening Land 
Lingua Franca 
Brooks
Cristom 
R. Stuart & Co

Evening Land and Lingua Franca were our favorites. The woman who led us through our tasting at Evening Land was very knowledgeable, and their Pinots had some real substance to them. The Chardonnays had great balance to them. We got the small plates at Lingua Franca and got to meet Archie the Scottish Terrier. He was a charming little gentleman. The tasting room was a modern glass cube, basically, and the vibes were great. Dan helped us pick Brooks because they have an actual lunch menu and great views. By the time we got to Cristom and R. Stuart (which is a tasting room back in McMinnville), we were less discerning about the wine, so to speak, haha 

On day 2, we went north and did the area between Dundee and Carlton. We stopped at:

Domaine Drouhin 
Haakon/Lenai
Dominio IV 
Lemelson 
Ken Wright 

Domaine Drouhin had the best views of the weekend (pictured), but we were wildly underwhelmed by the wine. Everything tasted thin, like it was watered down almost. Haakon/Lenai is affiliated with Purple Hands and has a tasting room on the vineyard property (as opposed to the Purple Hands tasting room in Dundee). They had Purple Hands wines, but our flights were just Haakon/Lenai. They were great and we took home two bottles of Chardonnay. There's really something special about drinking a wine while looking at the specific vines that produced the grapes. Dominio IV was another Dan suggestion, in part because they allow outside food. He picked up sandwiches for us from Red Hills Market (very tasty, but enormous. My wife and I could have split one easily). Dominio had a wider variety than the standard Pinot/Chardonnay mix we got at most of the vineyards. I confess that Pinot is not my favorite varietal, and though I had some great ones this trip, I really enjoyed their Tempranillo and big red blend. We ended up joining this wine club. Lemelson and Ken Wright (Carlton tasting room) were also very nice, but not the most memorable. 

Overall it was a great trip. The weather was perfect and the people were very nice. Even though probably 85% of the wines we tasted were Pinot Noir or Chardonnay, it was fun to taste the differences that winemaking techniques and location made. The tastings were cheaper than Napa, but the bottles seemed to be more expensive. We were happy to support smaller operations, though, and look forward to our next trip back!",8,1754241960.0,wine,2,0.9,False

# Juliette Has A Gun - Musc Invisible

*Basic musk*

**Notes:**

**Top -** Jasmine

**Middle -** Cotton Flower

**Base -** Musk

The opening is a little screechy and alcohol-heavy, but this soon smoothes and dries down into a fresh, ever so slightly floral musk. If this has jasmine, it's certainly not definable to my nose - the florals read as more of a background white floral 'vibe'. 

The divisive JHAG 'DNA' - a signature woody muskiness from ambroxan, though not listed here, is definitely present in the sillage. I am a fan.

Most reviews compare this to the legendary [Body Shop White Musk](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/The-Body-Shop/White-Musk-2432.html) and I have to agree - a scent so ubiquitous in the 90s and early 2000s that smelling this makes me feel nostalgic. 

It's powdery, pretty, easy, clean. This is the definition of an easy reach for me.

tbh, it makes me want to buy a bottle of Body Shop White Musk!

I could smell this on me at the end of the work day and resprayed for the evening- very little to fault it - but you can get very similar scents for less than half the price.

**8/10**



# Byredo - Blanche

*Aldehydic musk*

**Notes:**

**Top -** Aldehydes, Rose, Pink Pepper 

**Middle -** Peony, Violet. African Orange Flower

**Base -** Musk, Woodsy Notes, Sandalwood

This is THE 'freshly washed clothes' scent. I love the basic blue 'Lenor' fabric softener and that's what this smells like to me - clean, soft, laundry-fresh, a touch soapy, floral but in a nondescript way - any floral notes are overtaken by fresh, soapy aldehydes.

Blanche is a good name for this - it makes me think of crisp, white, luxury hotel sheets - maybe cleaned with a stronger laundry powder than you would use at home to drown out the sins of the previous occupants - Blanche is aggressively aldehydic, it nearly veers into smelling like cleaning agents. 

I do love the clean, freshly washed vibe of this, it makes me feel put together.

However, as much as I enjoy the effect of this perfume, I wouldn't pay the crazy price to essentially smell like elevated Febreeze.

The moderate sillage lasts around 4 hours. I'm in two minds about Blanche -  It's been a very pleasant wear - so chill, relaxing, smelling it genuinely lifted my mood - but part of me also thinks selling a fresh laundry scent for ¬£300 is a bit of a scam.

I smelled this on my t-shirt the next day and loved it - I will never have the cash to buy this but there's something about it - is this a scam or¬†a work of genius!? Idk!? 

**8/10**



# Room 1015 - Sonic Flower

*Powdery musk*

**Notes:**

**Top -** Carrot Seeds, Pink Pepper

**Middle -** Orris, Jasmine

**Base -** Musk, Ambroxan, Cashmeran

Ok so this one kinda pissed me off. I think this is the first time I've tried a scent (that isn't from a Middle Eastern/dupe house) that smells exactly like another popular scent.

This is [Glossier You](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Glossier/You-46885.html). Maybe a touch lighter, but it's Glossier You. I just found this redundant as Glossier You was THE scent when I first got properly into perfume, one of the first full size bottles I got & I wore it a lot. 

Don't get me wrong, I love Glossier You but I feel like that profile has passed a bit. I get that perfumes can smell like other perfumes, but to smell like a perfume that was so popular and very dominant for a few years is just bit egregious.

It's iris musk on an ambroxan base. It's Glossier You. It lasts a few hours.

After not liking Jasmine Freak at all, I just think this house might be a swerve overall for me.

**5/10**



# Diptyque- L'eau Papier

*Rice musk*

**Notes -** 

Musk, White Musk, Sesame, Mimosa, Woody Notes

I was a little bit worried about the 'steamed rice' description of this but this isn't a gourmand. I love the opening - super fresh, clean and a touch savory, a touch sharp. Tt steers away from smelling like food and the slightly floral and sharp edge of the musk keeps this in 'smells like perfume' territory. 

It is soft and comforting, very office appropriate- reminds me a bit of my current office wear [Ode to Dullness](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Juliette-Has-A-Gun/Ode-To-Dullness-84757.html). 

The floral notes really elevate this -the fluffy mimosa note makes this lean very feminine to my nose. 

I tried this again on a lazy Sunday and really loved the balance here - while people who don't like it say it smells savory, it doesn't quite lean that way to my nose (an issue I had with BTSO [Dirty Rice](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/BORNTOSTANDOUT/Dirty-Rice-78862.html)). The sesame and mimosa is a winning combo- it's the florals that make this a great perfume.

**8/10**



# Maison Francis Kurkdjian- Gentle Fluidity Gold

*Vanilla musk*

**Notes:** 

**Top -** Juniper Berries, Nutmeg

**Middle -** Coriander

**Base -** Vanilla, Musk, Caramel, Amberwood

I pick up juniper berries in the opening, enveloped by lots of fluffy white musk and a comforting vanilla. The sillage is powerful, I can smell it radiating and creating a true 'bubble' around me as this develops.

The vanilla deepens with time and becomes sweeter and fluffier - when I walk from my desk, I pick up wafts of gentle, soft vanilla and musk with an edge of juniper. I feel like I pick up different facets at different moments too - sometimes this smells like vanilla baking essence, sometimes it leans more towards a green/aromatic vanilla- it's a beautiful effect. Sometimes smells a touch medicinal.

However, after a couple of hours, I really turned on this fragrance. The sweetness isn't a natural one, and the medicinal quality, which can be pleasant, develops into something bitter, sour and distracting. Some elements smelled metallic to me in the later drydown. 

After the mixed response on the first wear, I decided to retry this & immediately disliked the opening. It felt like a vanilla without confidence, a vanilla hiding, with my nose desperately trying to catch it, and getting bitterness instead- strange perfume, strange experience!

**5/10**

# Initio Parfums - Musk Therapy

*Citrus Musk*

**Notes -** 

White Musk, Musk, Black Currant, Bergamot, Mandarin Orange, Magnolia, White Sandalwood, Hedione

This one has a hospital/medical devices vibe- like a piece of equipment that is freshly cleaned and wiped down with lemon-scented antibacterial wipes. Closer to my wrist, I can make out the very yummy blackcurrant note - I like the smell oh my wrist more than the sillage, which is noticeably different. 

The sillage is a clean musk that leans into cleaning wipe/laundry detergent. There is a touch of baby wipes/baby powder which I really dislike.

I think it's a pretty and well-balanced take on musk- and I think the title fits the perfume well - but I can't really get over the baby wipes vibe I sometimes get from musk perfumes. Baby wipes make me think of only one thing - baby poop, and it's such a specific scent. I can't get rid of that association.

**5/10**

# Parle Moi de Parfum - Milky Musk 39

*Milky Musk*

**Notes -** 

Sandalwood, Musk

The opening is all sandalwood, and this dries down to a creamy and comforting skin scent - the musk is soft and familiar, like a hug from a friend, with a decent sillage that works as a bit of 'scent therapy'. I am testing this on a difficult, stressful morning and this is already making me feel much more centred and 'zen'.

I think this is a less 'fuzzy', maybe better blended, version of [Piano Santal](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/L-Orchestre-Parfum/Piano-Santal-57336.html) \- it is incredibly smooth. A very pretty scent.

I only get sillage in the first hour, then this sits pretty close to the skin.

This is meant to be a simple, linear 'skin scent', but I kept on getting the sense that it needed something a little more, an extra layer, some extra *oomph*.

**7/10**



# Clean Reserve - Radiant Nectar

*Fruity Musk*

**Notes -** 

**Top -** Pear, Ambrette (Musk Mallow)

**Middle -** Tobacco Blossom, Carrot Seeds, Orris

**Base -** Musk, Ambroxan, White Cedar Extract

Dying at the fact that the bottle for this has a tiny picture of a bee on the bottle to 'raise awareness' for Earth Day- *go on girl give us nothing!* 

The incredibly sweet, dense opening hits with a pear note but this isn't a fresh pear but a stewed, maybe even a baked pear. 

I'm so hit and miss with pear notes, I LOVE the pear opening in [Alien Hypersense](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Mugler/Alien-Hypersense-89599.html) but struggle with the super sweet pear in [JPG La Belle](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Jean-Paul-Gaultier/La-Belle-55786.html). This doesn't quite fit in either of those slots - it's not quite a caramelised pear, but definitely has that baked vibe (or maybe overly ripe vibe - even on the verge of rotting). I wish it was a touch fresher.

The stewed pear is sitting on a bed of musky and ambery notes. Incredibly cloying. I can't believe this is recommended as a spring/summer spray.

While the opening is strong, the sillage is weak and all I get after ten minutes is an overly synthetic musk. Slightly earthy. It is giving me a bit of an ashtray vibe. The pear has disappeared.

I don't get any freshness here. I don't like it. Overly sweet synthetic opening fading into cigarette ash - my nose did not like this one one bit.

# Matiere Premiere - Parisian Musc

*Woody Musk*

**Notes -** 

**Top -** Virginia Cedar

**Middle -** Ambrette (Musk Mallow)

**Base -** Musk, Ambrettolide, Ambroxan

After being incredibly impressed by [Vanilla Powder](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Matiere-Premiere/Vanilla-Powder-84933.html), I really wanted to try some more from this line. 

I am so intrigued because the top 'This Perfume Reminds Me Of' on Fragrantica for this is Philosykos and Santal 33 - to me these are two completely different perfumes.

But what do you know... the opening smells like a mix of Santal 33 & Philosykos. It's got the fresh woodiness of Santal (with the oakmoss and leather removed) and a slightly bitter green edge that Philosykos has - with the yummy creaminess of both.

There's so much going on here for what appears to be a simple woody musk. There's a peppery edge, lactonic nuances, a touch of resinous sweetness- the cedar note reminds me a bit of [Commodity Milk](https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Commodity/Milk-69191.html). 

It smells figgy too - a woody, figgy musk. It's beautiful. This has a powerful enveloping effect with plenty of sillage.

This is very unisex, great one for those who love Santal 33 & want something in the same family that is more suitable for hot weather.

More than anything this just smells good. It makes me feel confident, put together, clean, ready to take on a long day. This ticks so many boxes for me. I would love a body wash and hand wash of this so I can radiate Parisian Musc all day.

This lasted about three hours on my first try. I wore this again on a hotter day (works so well in the heat!) and this lasted a good five hours on a day where I was moving about and working a light sweat.

Love this one - definitely the most versatile and unique musk I've tried! 

**9/10**



# Xerjoff - Apollonia

*Orris Musk*

**Notes -** 

**Top -** White Flowers

**Middle -** Orris 

**Base -** White Musk

The opening is orris-heavy - strong and powdery, slightly earthy and a touch animalic. It smells a touch musty to my nose, and definitely has a vintage feel. Of all the musks I've tried for this exploration, this is the 'muskiest'.

This opens strong but I lost sillage about about two hours - I detect a pleasant iris musk on my wrist, but overall this was a disappointing experience for me as I was expecting something very strong and ethereal.

This is very powerful in the opening hour but settles and fades pretty quickly on my skin. It's nice but underwhelming. Not that impressed by this.

**6/10**

  
Seems like I prefer the woodier takes on musk. Would love to hear your favourite musk perfumes or recommend any you think I should be trying.

1mgosw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1mgosw9/do_my_symptoms_sound_like_gerd/,Do my symptoms sound like GERD?,"History: 

I started getting acid reflux around 6 years ago. I saw a GI who did an endoscopy and found acid damage related to GERD and put me on 20mg Omeprazole daily which I eventually tapered off to 20mg every other day. This kept my reflux in check and I was able to eat and drink whatever I wanted. 

In 2023 I went on a trip and forgot my omeprazole. I ended up getting extremely bad reflux due to being off of it for over a week. When I got back I saw a different GI due to moving who put me on 40mg Omeprazole daily and did another endoscopy. He found a 2cm HH. I eventually tapered back down to 20mg of Omeprazole every other day and was able to go back to doing whatever I wanted. 

1 month ago I started experiencing horrible chest pressure. It did not feel like reflux. I went to the ER to rule out anything cardiac and they said it sounded like gastritis and told me to see my PCP. I saw my PCP who also said gastritis and gave me sucralfate. I saw my GI and he told me to go back to 40mg Omeprazole daily and ordered an ultrasound, abdominal CT scan, and another endoscopy. I mentioned that I was feeling occasional palpatations/loud heartbeat and he wants me to see a cardiologist to clear me for anesthesia before the EGD. I also made an appt with my ENT to check for LPR just in case.

Symptoms: 

* Weird pressure in chest. It feels like there is a balloon right behind the bottom of my rib cage that sometimes inflates. Thankfully it has varying intensity. Some days it's noticeably uncomfortable. Some days I don't notice it at all. 

* Lack of desire to eat. I used to love eating and drinking. For the past month I've had to almost force myself to eat meals. It's gotten better over the past few weeks, but I don't get excited about eating at all. It's not for lack of hunger because I still get hunger pangs. 

* A LOT of bloating in abdomen. I feel gas gurgles constantly in my gut even when the only thing I'm putting into my stomach is water. Sometimes I burp 20-30 times a day. Other days not at all. I've tried taking Gas-X but it doesn't do anything.

* Globus sensation that comes and goes throughout the day and slight sore throat. No mucus or hoarseness in voice. 

* I'm not experiencing any of the traditional heartburn symptoms that I've associated with GERD. No acidic burps or burning. 

Things I've done: 

Radically changed diet. I used to drink 2 cups of coffee a day. Seltzer all day. Beers on the weekend. I've cut out all caffiene, carbonation, and alcohol. Cut out fast food and anything processed. Most of my meals consist of chicken, rice, vegetables, fruits, eggs, yogurt. 

I keep a food journal, but I can't seem to find any kind of trigger foods. Some days my symptoms are worse than others, but I can't seem to find a link between them and diet. I had a single cup of coffee and feel no different. I ate a slice of pizza last night which should have been a trigger.  4-5 hours later I ended up getting lower GI irritation probably due to not eating anything greasy for weeks because I ended up having a BM and the discomfort went away.

I've done some research into HH since that's the only thing that really stands out on my latest EGD, but I was just wondering if there are any other avenues that I should follow. Thanks so much if you read my long post.",2,1754241518.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

1mgoqg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1mgoqg4/audio_cues_in_ai_video_that_nobody_talks_about/,Audio cues in AI video that nobody talks about (but completely change the feel),"everyone focuses on visuals but audio descriptions are probably the most underutilized part of ai video prompting

Most creators completely ignore audio cues in their prompts. Huge mistake. Adding simple audio descriptions makes clips feel dramatically more realistic and engaging.

**Why audio cues work:**

AI models understand that audio and visuals are connected. When you describe audio, it influences the visual generation to match that sonic environment.

**Audio cues that add realism:**

**Environmental ambience:**
- ‚Äúdistant traffic hum‚Äù
- ‚Äúair conditioning buzz‚Äù
- ‚Äúwind through trees‚Äù
- ‚Äúocean waves in background‚Äù

**Activity-specific sounds:**
- ‚Äúmechanical keyboard clicks‚Äù
- ‚Äúpapers rustling‚Äù

- ‚Äúfootsteps on hardwood‚Äù
- ‚Äúcoffee machine brewing‚Äù

**Emotional audio:**
- ‚Äúheavy breathing‚Äù
- ‚Äúheart beating‚Äù
- ‚Äúnervous finger tapping‚Äù
- ‚Äúdeep exhale‚Äù

**Technical audio:**
- ‚Äúmicrophone feedback‚Äù
- ‚Äúradio static‚Äù
- ‚Äúelectronic beeps‚Äù
- ‚Äúmachinery humming‚Äù

**Before/after examples:**

**Without audio cues:**

```
Medium shot, programmer working late at night, multiple monitors, tired expression, 35mm lens
```

**With audio cues:**

```
Medium shot, programmer working late at night, multiple monitors, tired expression, 35mm lens, Audio: mechanical keyboard clicks, distant traffic, air conditioning hum, occasional mouse clicks
```

The second version produces more atmospheric, believable results.

**Platform-specific audio thinking:**

**TikTok:** Audio cues that suggest trending sounds or music compatibility

**Instagram:** Ambient audio that works with both music overlays and natural sound

**YouTube:** Audio descriptions that support longer-form content narrative

**The layering technique:**

Build audio environments in layers:

**Base layer:** Room tone (air conditioning, distant traffic)
**Activity layer:** Action-specific sounds (typing, walking, cooking)

**Detail layer:** Subtle additions (papers rustling, breathing, clothing movement)

**Example:**

```
Audio: [Base] office ambience, fluorescent light buzz [Activity] rapid keyboard typing [Detail] mouse clicks, paper shuffling, coffee sip
```

**Audio that matches camera movement:**

**Dolly in:** ‚ÄúAudio: footsteps approaching, breathing intensifies‚Äù
**Pan left/right:** ‚ÄúAudio: environmental sounds shift stereo field‚Äù
**Handheld:** ‚ÄúAudio: slight movement sounds, natural camera handling‚Äù

**Emotional audio amplification:**

**Tension:** ‚ÄúAudio: heartbeat, shallow breathing, distant sirens‚Äù
**Peace:** ‚ÄúAudio: gentle wind, bird songs, soft footsteps‚Äù

**Energy:** ‚ÄúAudio: upbeat background music, energetic movement sounds‚Äù
**Focus:** ‚ÄúAudio: keyboard clicks, paper turning, concentrated breathing‚Äù

**Technical implementation:**

Place audio cues at the end of your prompt after visual elements. The AI processes visual-first, then enhances with audio context.

**Common audio mistakes:**

**Too complex:** ‚ÄúAudio: orchestral music with car engines and people talking and birds singing‚Äù
**Too generic:** ‚ÄúAudio: background noise‚Äù

**Conflicting:** Peaceful visuals with intense audio cues

**Keep it simple and matched.**

**Testing audio impact:**

Generate same visual prompt with and without audio cues. The audio versions consistently feel more professional and engaging.

I do this testing through [these guys](https://arhaam.xyz/veo3) since audio testing requires multiple iterations to find the right balance.

**The subtlety principle:**

Audio cues should enhance, not dominate. ‚ÄúGentle wind‚Äù usually works better than ‚Äústrong wind howling.‚Äù

**Cultural audio context:**

Different environments have expected audio signatures:
- **Office:** Keyboard clicks, phone rings, air conditioning

- **Cafe:** Espresso machine, quiet conversation, chair scraping
- **Street:** Traffic, footsteps, distant music, car doors
- **Home:** TV in background, appliances, creaking floors

**Volume and intensity descriptors:**

- ‚ÄúDistant‚Äù vs ‚Äúclose‚Äù vs ‚Äúimmediate‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSoft‚Äù vs ‚Äúloud‚Äù vs ‚Äúoverwhelming‚Äù
- ‚ÄúGentle‚Äù vs ‚Äúharsh‚Äù vs ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSubtle‚Äù vs ‚Äúprominent‚Äù vs ‚Äúdominant‚Äù

**The audio-visual connection:**

When you describe audio, the AI adjusts visuals to match:
- ‚ÄúEcho‚Äù suggests large spaces
- ‚ÄúMuffled sounds‚Äù suggests enclosed areas

- ‚ÄúClear audio‚Äù suggests open environments
- ‚ÄúReverb‚Äù suggests hard surfaces

**Dragon‚Äôs Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Hour 2100.**

The whirr of the generator drowned out all other noises as Max went back into his metallic barracks, to finished setting up a old projector similar to those from the mid-21st century the size of the ritual book we had signed earlier today. He set the projector up pointing at the far wall on a a dark grey industrial stand reading Secure Contain Protect.

""Consider this your briefing on the foundation, and most of it is classified so don't tell a soul,""

I sat down slowly feeling the chair slightly bend under the weight of the suit crying out with a metal on metal.

Max kneeled down powering up the projector before turning to me. ""Are you sure your ready for this? The truth is not easy to digest.""

I almost said no at first, I left fantasy behind after we moved houses instead focusing on what actually mattered, but that small part of me from before that part of me that dreamed of magic and of fiction that *childish*, persistent part didn't back down, It whispered, yes. ""I can handle the truth.""

""We shall see.""

Max pressed the play button on the side of the projector, and the machine came to life quickly covering the far wall stabilizing into the logo I had seen on the side of his suitcase.

""The foundation was created to protect the world we know and love, and the anomalous from each other, and to keep a sense of normalcy"" The footage shifted to photos. Cities. Towns. People laughing. Ordinary life. Then flickering overlays of containment symbols, and horrors similar to what you would see in a movie.

""The start of the foundation is classified, how it started also classified, but for years we secured new anomalies contained them and protected them, however not all anomalies can be put into a box and left, so we developed what is called special containment procedures for these entities, also known as SCP's"" Images flashed across the screen. Containment chambers. Glowing runes. A concrete vault with a single red button. A coffee machine.

""We contained the mundane SCP's like A coffee machine that dispenses any liquid that is asked of it, a key that can open any door, others not so much such as a the hard to destory reptile a extremely adaptive giant lizard that has a burning hatred for all life, your friendly neighborhood Keter who can conjure portals and pull any item out of it to his understanding of that object, Anantashesha a absolutely giant sea serpent that produces a chemical that give a person amnesia which we use to make amnestics so anybody who finds out something they shouldn't have won't remember, god the list goes on and on with well over 10,000 SCP's in total by the mid 20st century,"" The tone of the footage shifted again.

Now I saw destruction‚Äîblurry footage of a burning forest, people running from a massive serpentine shadow beneath crashing waves. Next, a lab technician screaming silently in a room flooded with pink gas. A series of charts flicked by, showing global containment maps and growing red zones.

I swallowed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ too many.‚Äù

Max continued. ""While there were other groups such as the Global Occult Coalition or the GOC ran by the UN at the time to kill any anomaly or use that anomaly to kill other anomalies, The Serpent's Hand who advocated for anomalies to have right, and freedom, the chaos insurgency a splinter faction of the SCP Foundation, formed by defectors who believe in weaponizing anomalies rather than containing them. We were the top dog more power then any other group and control over a majority of anomalies, and worked with the authorization of most world powers... until 2027 which was the start of the foundations downfall."" The next series of clips were fast, like a history reel. UN troops. Serpent's Hand demonstrations, books floating in midair, a creature made of living flesh standing before a cult.

""2027 as you know, was the start of world war 3, and while it usually wouldn't effect the foundation too much, it was the perfect storm with groups of interest becoming more bold, eventually leading to the first domino, you might know it as the Scathing of Seoul. The chaos insurgency had over the years collected samples of a multitude of biological SCP's such as 008 the zombie virus, 610 the flesh that hates 217 the clockwork virus, and 409 the contagious crystal and released it on the city, within 2 hours 1.5 million people were infected with one of those SCPs, and in 6 hours close to half the city was infected, left with no choice, either attempt to contain the outbreak which would have infected the entirety of the country in at least a week which was unacceptable-or drop multiple nukes killing all 10 million people, and ending the outbreak."" Images of chaos, smoke, creatures of flesh twisting in impossible shapes. clouds of people freezing to crystals. Mechanized digits, and features faintly seem under skin. Bodies swarming and falling, rising again into the living dead, it was worse then any horror movie or nightmare I have ever seen I wanted to look away but I couldn't.

""And so after telling North and South Korea we launch multiple nukes from North Korea ending the lives of millions to save ten's or hundred's of millions more.""

""This however is still not the reason for the downfall we could recover from that, we were prepared to handle worse. But we were not prepared for what happened just 2 years later.""

""At the beginning of May research teams observing SCP-2317 also known as The Devourer of Worlds saw that SCP-2317 was causing the final chain holding him imprisoned inside of his pocket dimension in a cabinet so it was quickly sent to Tibet to fight it away from any major population centers, and notified the GOC to prepare for its eventual escape, but while in transport the Chaos Insurgency were able to shoot it down the cargo plane about 1000 miles from Tibet, and unfortunately with that delay we were not able to get it to Tibet in time, and The Devourer of Worlds had broken free."" A humanoid, obese creature with scaly skin, branch-like horns, and a jawless head, and a single massive red eyeball.

""The Devourer of World was eventually stop with a join effort between the GOC, the foundation, SCP-5514 The dragon slayer, the Gate Guardian and a few hundred nukes we were able to kill the Devourer, but not before it was able to destroy the Three Gorges Dam This was covered up as a earthquake, and protected discovery of the battlefields, and it causing the deaths of 88 million the loss of homes form 400 million and the cascading collapse of governments due to people fleeing into other countries such as most of Asia, Africa, South America, half the middle east, and most of the Balkans. ""Now I couldn‚Äôt look away. The screen showed a wave larger than anything I‚Äôd seen swallowing cities. No sound. Just destruction quickly followed my refuges overwhelming countries and causing them to fall into anarchy.

""This led to the loss of multiple facilities and weakened the foundation to the point where the chaos insurgency took over most sites in countries with anarchy, and almost taking the site in Egypt, and the newly built site in Saudi Arabia.""

""This coupled with the fact the UN took global dominance and control, the foundation was put as a puppet to the GOC leading to over 1000 SCP's considered dangerous to be killed or destroyed. Thankfully it is not all gloom, because with the extra manpower with the GOC, we were able to almost stomp out the Chaos Insurgency with a 'Pacification campaign to stabilize countries in anarchy'.""

""After that the foundation and GOC worked together to exterminate multiple SCP's that threatened humanity, the most notable of such is that of SCP-4220 the moon leading to it being killed and filling up with moon rocks instead of a egg, SCP-3003 ending with the destruction of all planets with any 3003.-1,-2, -3 entities through anomalous means, and the total destruction of -4 after stealing the tech.""

""And for the current chapter in our history, the foundation was finally able break away from the UN in 3007, almost reaching the same power disparity as pre cataclysm foundation was to the GOC."" Max turned off the projector, and turned to me laying backward on his chair.

""Now that is over lets get more mission related."" I could only nod along left speechless my all the death and suffering I had seen.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no easy way to explain this,‚Äù Max said, stepping away from the suitcase, his voice quieter now, more personal. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm an SCP myself. I‚Äôm not going to tell you my number‚Äîbut I‚Äôll tell you about me.‚Äù

(I am making this SCP myself and I have not posted it to the SCP wiki, Hope you like it.)

‚ÄúFirst, let‚Äôs start with the age thing. I stopped aging at ten. Been stuck this way ever since.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how old are you?‚Äù I asked, blinking through the mental fog still settling over me.

‚ÄúOver a thousand years.‚Äù

I stared. I didn‚Äôt flinch. I didn‚Äôt gasp. I didn‚Äôt even feel surprise. I was simply too emotionally drained for that. My body couldn‚Äôt take another shock. It was like hearing about the weather.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs the reaction I usually get,‚Äù Max muttered. ‚ÄúAnyway, that‚Äôs not my main power.‚Äù

He stepped back toward the suitcase and continued, ‚ÄúIf I watch a movie, play a video game, read a book, ect. I can use their abilities of the characters or summon them. The more time I spend with it, the stronger the character becomes. It‚Äôs a linear growth. As you‚Äôve noticed, that‚Äôs how I use telekinesis, to hold you to your seat during Thacea's signing. But the ability I enjoy the most?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can enter any media. Like actually go into the world and interact with it as if I were really there.‚Äù

I finally sat straighter. The exhausted child in me‚Äîthe one that had been silent through the Foundation‚Äôs horrors‚Äîstirred, curious again. Max knelt next to his suitcase and popped the locks with a satisfying click.

‚ÄúThere are other details about my abilities, but let‚Äôs move to the gear I brought.""

‚ÄúFirst up: my suit. It‚Äôs not made from mana-resistant materials‚Äîit‚Äôs filled with miniature Scranton Reality Anchors. They weaken or nullify reality-bending effects. That‚Äôs good because I can handle extreme levels of mana exposure. Bad because they dampen my powers too. Thankfully, a thousand years is a long time to watch TV, read books, and grind out video games. So I‚Äôm still about as powerful as I was in the early years of all this. Not helpless, but it is a kick in the shins.‚Äù

‚ÄúSecond, the suitcase itself. It‚Äôs not an SCP, but it was affected by one, SCP-184. A metallic decahedron that expands internal space of a object or room. If SCP-184 is left in that room or object for too long, it adds random rooms and starts copying things poorly. But it I don't need a large room, so right now it‚Äôs just a 500-square-foot bunker in a box. It‚Äôs where I store essentials, and a backup home just in case the barracks breaks down.‚Äù

He stepped aside and let me peek in. Inside, I saw racks of crates, shelves of neatly arranged gear, a compact workbench, stacked rations, even a small bed.

‚ÄúAs for the barracks,‚Äù he gestured to the metal walls around us, ‚Äúthey‚Äôre prefabricated and spatially compressed too. Comes with its own Scranton Anchors. Just a personal space to work and sleep. I‚Äôm not living out of a suitcase for a year.‚Äù

Then he knelt again and pulled out a series of sealed cases, with care he opened them one by one ""Finally the arsenal, they gave me some SCP's that might come in handy,""

He held up a bronze key, still gleaming despite its age. ""SCP-005 ‚Äì The Skeleton Key. This key can open any lock, or door,‚Äù he said simply, then tucked it back into its box.

""SCP-458 ‚Äì The Never-Ending Pizza Box."" He cracked the lid open just a sliver. My stomach growled instantly as the unmistakable scent of pepperoni wafted into the air‚Äîor maybe it didn‚Äôt. I wouldn't know because of the air filtration through the suit.

He handled this one with care. ‚ÄúSCP-610 ‚Äì The Flesh That Hates. This is one you saw during the Scathing of Seoul but don‚Äôt worry, this is just insurance.‚Äù He held it up: a three-layered container, the innermost made of some dark alloy, the other two clear some tough plastics. I instinctively leaned back, the memory of that footage causing bile to rise in my throat.

He lit up as a bright orange blob moved out of his small house/box, bounced happily, releasing, and cheerful gurgle. ‚ÄúSCP-999 ‚Äì The Tickle Monster. He can cure depression, and overall makes you feel happy. Just look at him so cu-‚Äù Max cleared his throat, trying to stay professional. Then the tickle monster climbed on top of me gurgling again, making me to feel better even through the suit.

Opening the final case Max held up a bright blue foam dart with a orange tip, and. ‚ÄúThis is SCP-3108 The Nerfing Gun. It nerfs anything the dart hits.‚Äù He set it down gently back into the box before closing it.

He started packing everything back into the suitcase, his expression more serious now. The room settled into silence again, the hum of the generator filling the air like white noise.

## faqs section

Consumers often have specific questions when considering a burl wood coffee table.

**how do I care for a burl wood coffee table?**
Maintaining a burl wood coffee table is relatively straightforward. Regular dusting with a soft cloth is essential. For cleaning, use a damp cloth and mild soap, avoiding harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners. Applying a quality wood polish or conditioner every few months will help maintain the wood's luster and protect it from drying out. Avoid placing hot or wet items directly on the surface without coasters or placemats.

**Are burl wood coffee tables sustainable?**
The sustainability of burl wood depends on its sourcing. Opting for tables made from reclaimed or salvaged burl wood is the most environmentally responsible choice.These pieces utilize wood that would otherwise be discarded, minimizing the impact on forests.Certifications from organizations like the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) can also indicate responsible sourcing practices.

**Will the epoxy resin on the edge yellow over time?**
The likelihood of epoxy resin yellowing depends on the type of resin used and its exposure to UV light. High-quality,UV-resistant epoxy resins are less prone to yellowing. Though, prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can still cause some discoloration over time. To mitigate this, keep the table away from direct sunlight or use window coverings to filter UV rays.

I really want to find a space such as a little book shop/cafe where I can do some online work/hang out at that doesn't cost an arm and leg. I'm not opposed to spending money, but there are certain weeks when funds are much tighter than normal, but work needs to get done. 

I've been to Coffee culture, most timmies, London Library, Willie's, Happiness and similar spots, and do enjoy them, but I really want to find a new spot where I can comfortably sit and work/hangout at without worry that I've overstayed. Does this type of space exist here in London? Does anyone have any suggestions?

From the chain wrestling to start, followed by building up Gunther‚Äôs first connected chop, to the actual roller coaster of Punk getting little hope spots to see that he was coming back, and getting cut off by Gunther in brutal fashion was amazing to see. Working around the ring, moving from one area to another, but slowing down the action to let everything register was incredible. Terrific pacing. 

You could see fans coming up, then down, then up a bit more, down, and then coming unglued after Gunther started bleeding. And let‚Äôs talk about Gunther‚Äôs selling in those last few minutes. Clutching his nose, panicking to the corner, looking like a lost child not knowing what to do. And kudos for not resorting to kicking out of punk‚Äôs GTS multiple times, but still keeping Gunther strong by using 2 GTS‚Äôs to finish him off.

My opinion may not mean much, but as a guy who had a cup of coffee on the indies and listened to a bunch of veterans discuss how matches should pace and work out, this was damn near perfect IMO.

We are just 3 and a half weeks away from the release of the next set with reveals likely then in 2 and a half weeks. And with the release of that set we'll then be heading into the regular release pattern of a set every 2 months. 

But enough about that. Let's have a look at what happened over the following week!

**Forestcraft**

*Within the great forests, where ancient beasts only mentioned in obscure legends roam. Titania is going through this years great Roach Tithe from all the various towns, villages and other administrative units within her part of the Great Forest. Much to the surprise of Lovesign who just thought that sort of thing.. happened. Quickly earned him the scornful eyes of Titania and countless courtiers. Proper logistics matter after all, especially when it comes to the most important weapon in the great forest!*

Forestcraft This week continues to do its thing. Fairly succesful at tournaments with Roach and still seeing some Tempo Forest here and there. But as a whole, contained in its popularity in the current metagame on the ladder. No real signs of new decks either.

**[Roach Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cCQM.cCQM.cabE.cabE.cabE.cao2.cao2.cao2.capI.capI.capI.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cb2w.cb2w.cb2w.czCO.czCO.czCO.czFM.czFM.czFM.czU-.czU-.czhe.czhe)**

A combo deck built around the roach.  Showing fairly good success at various tournaments this week. As in a more focused metagame it can perform quite well. As it has less to worry about there and can target more specific decks. Comparatively on ladder where there are more threats and less control. It does see some less play. Though even there it remains the most played Forest deck. An interesting development this week outside of the success at Tournaments has been the arrival of Dwarven Malletman, typically as a one-off to give the deck some more options against more board focused decks. Though it has hardly become a standard inclusion.

**[Tempo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cC7c.cC7c.cC7c.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cYqk.cYqk.caY6.caY6.caY6.cabE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cbG-.cbG-.cbG-.cxFE.cxFE.czCO.czCO.czCO.czFM.czFM.czRs.czRs.czRs)**

A tempo deck built around Faeries and running down the opponent with them.  Still seeing play, even having a few brave souls taking it to tournaments. But beyond that, no real notable change this week, no major changes to the deck or anything. A decent deck in the meta for those that want to play Forest but want something more straightforward than Roach Forest.

---

**Swordcraft**

*In the great halls of the Fortress Swordcraft, Ornate Banners depicting all manner of events and victories ,long forgotten to but a select few. Albert finds himself wondering out loudly as to what is up with all of these Princesses and their attendants. Before Marie can let loose on him, he points out that there's already a whole bunch of princesses, but where's the princes ? The Kings and the queens ? Which does cool down Marie's wrath as that is a surprisingly good question from Albert. Where are they? And why are there so many princesses ? She'd delve more into this when there's a sudden and conspicously well timed assault on the main gate of the fortress by an unknown force.*

Swordcraft Continues to be one of the top classes in the game, only outdone by Runecraft as seen in recent tournaments. But on ladder remains quite popular and potent. This week continues to see Midrange Sword as the leading deck followed by Aggro Sword. There have been hints of other decks, including an Ambush Sword (but the account that posted that got deleted from twitter). As it is right now, there is just not much incentive to try anything out of Midrange or Aggro Sword.


**[Midrange Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cYqk.cYqk.cc-q.cc--.cc--.cc--.cdE8.cdE8.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdU4.cdU4.cdU4.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cdjO.cdjO.cdjO.cxFE.cxFE.c_Os.c_Os.c_u6.c_u6.c_u6.c_uG.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k)**

A Midrange deck built around a variety of generally efficient followers with a focus on more expensive followers. Remaining one of the most popular decks in the current metagame. it continues to see a lot of variations. Earlier this week Band of Battleprincesses saw some usage in decks, but has interestingly enough fallen out of favour with some decks now running Grimnir instead. And of course you still have those decks running a Yurius or two. Making the decks a bit hard to predict as not one deck plays quite the same. This week has seen the deck lose a bit of shine at Tournaments as its performance hasn't been quite as stellar as spellboost runes.

**[Aggro Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cEaA.cEaA.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cc-q.cc-q.cc-q.cc--.cc--.cc--.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cdjY.cdjY.cdjY.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.c_uG.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k)**

An Aggro deck built around fast and efficient threats. Still going reasonably well on ladder, it does of course linger under the colossal shadow of Midrange Sword. But it feels like it has seen a bit more play this week and even made some appearances at tournaments, though never making it into the finals. A reasonably choice for those who desire something a bit faster and more aggressive with Swordcraft.

**Runecraft**

*In the Teachers lounge at one of the many schools at the great academy of Runecraft, where knowledge rules, but money goes a long way. We find Daria busy dealing with the Coffee Machine Golem going on a rampage for the 4th time in a week. She really wish they'd put more money towards teacher faculties rather than benefits for the students of ""Patrons"" Just last week a literature teacher got hauled off by Goblins and no one did anything! Never mind she still had that pesky Kaori running around and asking questions to deal with. How else was she supposed to ascent to a more comfortable position at the academy?.*

Runecraft sits at the pinnacle of the Metagame with Hybrid Spellboost Rune being a dominant factor on ladder and at tournaments. Earth Rite Rune continues to see some play as well. But spellboost Rune is very much where it is at no matter the build. 

**[Hybrid Spellboost Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH1g.cH1g.cH1g.cH3E.cH3E.cH3E.cHIs.cHIs.cHIs.cYqu.cfTu.cfTu.cfTu.cfgY.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfy-.cfy-.cfy-.cfz8.cfz8.cfz8.cg9U.cg9U.cg9U.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cgCc.cgCc.cgCc.cwZU.cwZU.d27s.d2NU.d2NU.d2a8.d2a8.d2a8)**

A Combo control deck built around spellboosting and earth rites. Continuing the trend from last week of including Earth Rite cards. By now the most powerful deck going by Tournament results where it typically does the best. Additionally the deck itself continues to evolve with Dark Side now being used in the deck as a removal option. And in theory a bit of extra burst if it becomes necessary.  And this is of course just one of many ways to build the deck. Highlighting not just the power but the sheer versatility of the deck.

**[Earth Rite Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH1g.cH1g.cH1g.cYLU.cYLU.cYeE.cfQm.cfQm.cfQm.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfw0.cfw0.cfw0.cfwA.cfwA.cfwA.cg9U.cg9U.cg9U.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cwZU.cwZU.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d1r6.d1r6.d1r6.d24u.d24u.d24u.d2Z-.d2Z-.d2a8.d2a8.d2a8)**

A Midrange deck built around Earth rites. Refinement of Earth Rite continues, this particular list running Dark Side, as its ability to be both removal or extra reach gives it quite some versatility in the metagame. Beyond that, Earth Rite rune remains a decent deck in the current meta. But remains deeply in the shadow of Hybrid Spellboost Rune.

**Dragoncraft**

*Below Colossal tower of Dragoncraft, past the vaults of the Ancient Dragons. Filene is skulking about silently. For she is hiding from Galan and the chores she was supposed to do for him. But quite frankly she couldn't be bothered. She'd rather watch her favorite Shark V-tuber while doing nothing. And to do that, she'd have to go to the most secret spot in all of the Mountain. Alas unbeknownst to her, Galan knew of the place and was waiting. You can't trust Fennie with any secrets.*

Dragoncraft continues to be in an awkward spot as looking at Tournament data, it is the class that is struggling the most. That said, it's also the class coming up with new decks. So while it is not that powerful, it does remain playable on ladder. As Besides Aggro Dragon and Fennie Dragon. There is now Storm Dragon.


**[Aggro Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJSM.cJSM.cJSM.cJSg.cJVU.cJVU.cJVU.cJh-.cJh-.cJh-.cYLU.cYLU.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.chtK.chtK.chtK.ci6e.ci6e.ci6e.ci6y.ci6y.ci6y.ciNg.ciNg.ciNg.cibu.cibu.cibu.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4YY.d50E.d50E.d50E)**

An aggro deck built around followers with intimidation and storm with a few tricks thrown in.  Continuing to perform well. It is nonetheless just not as fast or popular as Aggro Dragon and lacks something more to stand out there. So while it does see play and can perform well. It ultimately lacks something.

**[Fennie Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.cYLU.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ci9c.ci9c.ci9c.ciM6.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMa.ciMa.cibk.cibk.cibk.cxFE.cxFE.d4HW.d4HW.d4HW.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.d50O.d50O.d50O)**

A midrange deck built around ramping fast into big threats.  This week Fennie Dragon seems to gain a bit of popularity, felt like last week people were moving away from it. But turns out i was wrong. Still seeing some play on the ladder and performing adequately. That said, expect to work for it.

**[Storm Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ci9c.ci9c.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.ciNg.ciNg.ciNg.cibk.cibk.cibk.cibu.cibu.cibu.cic2.cic2.cic2.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E)**

A Midrange deck built around ramping into big storm threats. Seemingly gaining a fair bit of popularity this week and becoming an actual established deck.  There are some variations to it. This particular one running Otohime's fan. But in general, they are very much just focused on ramping into the various storm threats as fast as possible and closing out the match quickly. How good it is we'll have to see. Maybe there will be some developments over the coming weeks. For now, approach with some caution.

---

**Abysscraft**

*In the Dungeons of Castle Abysscraft, where the sun has never shone and where some things have been locked away for so long. They have been entirely forgotten, even the reason they were sent into the dungeons in the first place. There we find Nio trying to assess the actual state of who is imprisoned and maybe try and score some free loot. Alas, turns out Diawl and Cerberus were ahead of him and most of all the good stuff in the Dungeon has been scooped up .*

Abysscraft continues to show a solid performance this week. Doing alright at tournaments, though nothing exceptional and showing good performance on the ladder all things considered. Aggro and Control remain the only decks.

**[Aggro Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cM8E.cM8E.cM8E.cYLU.cYLU.ckJ6.ckJ6.ckJ6.ckYu.ckYu.ckYu.ckaI.ckaI.ckaI.ckoq.ckoq.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d70M.d70M.d70M.d7D0.d7D0.d7D0)**

An aggro deck for abyss, all about getting in as much damage as fast as possible with a reasonable amount of burn damage to get the job done. Continuing to do fairly well as the best Aggro deck in the Infinity evolved meta. The deck largely remains the same with a few minor variations. But nothing significant.

**[Control Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ckYk.ckYk.ckaI.ckaI.ckoW.ckoW.ckoW.ckog.ckog.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.cl28.cl28.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d6zO.d6zO.d7SU.d7SU.d7SU.d7Se.d7Se.d7Se)**

A control deck built around grinding out the opponent and finishing them in the lategame. Similarly remaining in a good spot. Seeing some solid presence at tournaments as well. But beyond that, not much to really report on this week. Still some variations, some may run Cocytus. Others do not. Does require some experience and skill for the best results.


---

**Havencraft**

*In the great Cathedral City of Havencraft. Where every street is covered with blessings and where the light always shines (just don't ask from where) Aether is back from another failed negotation with Odin. Continuing his insistence on being a Freelancer rather than joining the Pantheon. She really can't stand the guy and Wilbert just hates his guts at this point. Not that anyone of them would say that out loud. But they both know the others feeling on the subject matter..*

Havencraft finds itself holding on. Ward Haven having stabilized a bit this week and storm haven continues to see a bit of play here and there as well.

**[Ward Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.c9hW.c9hW.c9hW.c9yY.cYeE.cYeE.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cm--.cm--.cn0i.cn0i.cnEw.cnEw.cnGK.cnGK.cnUO.cnUO.cnUO.cnUY.cnUY.cnUY.cwl-.cwl-.cwl-.cxFE.cxFO.cxFO.cxFO.d99s.d99s.d9Sc.d9Sc.d9uk.d9uk.d9uk.d9uu.d9uu.d9uu)**

A midrange deck built around Wards. Stabilizing this week a bit. The general drive this week appears to have been around the lategame and finishers with people either focusing on Lapis or Sacred Griffon. Sacred Griffon having the advantage of being a ward to get buffed by Wilberts crest. There have even been some mild successes at some tournaments with Ward Haven occasionally reaching the top 8 at some tournaments. 

**[Storm Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.cOMQ.cOMQ.cOMQ.cOc2.cOc2.cOc2.cYqk.cYqk.cmlq.cmlq.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cmoU.cmoU.cm_8.cm_8.cm_8.cn0Y.cn0Y.cn0Y.cnGA.cnGA.cnGA.cnGK.cnGK.cnGK.cnUO.cnUO.cnUO.cnUY.cnUY.cnUY.cxFE.cxFE.d9PU.d9PU.d9PU.d9f6.d9f6)**

A midrange deck built around setting up big tempo swings with Amulets and big storm followers towards the end.  Not much to report on the deck this week. Deck is seeing some play, on ladder and is seeing steady if subdued performance. It continues to lack more amulets to really do something with.

---

**Portalcraft**

*Within Portalcraft City and its meany slums. We find Orchis isn't there. Instead she's at a lavish ball with all of the cities most ""upstanding"" citizenry. Discussing the finer minutiae of Puppetry and how to get the most of ones puppets. When suddenly the doors to the ball slam open, and a soaked Dreizehn walks in hauls out Orchis. Much to the confusion of assembled guests. Though Orchis handles it with the grace and patience of a god. Turns out Dreizehn had forgotten the passcode to the apartment and needed Orchis to tell her it. A common occurence. Once dealt with Orchis returns to the ball and everyone acts like nothing happened.. *

Portalcraft holds on in its own position with Artifact and Puppet Portal. Seeing some success at the Shadowverse Pro League and some steady presence at the top 8 of various tournaments. But beyond that, not much else to really report on this week.

**[Artifact Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.cQn6.cQqE.cQqE.cQqE.cpBw.cpBw.cpBw.cpEu.cpEu.cpEu.cpRO.cpRO.cpUM.cpUM.cpUM.cpUW.cpUW.cpUW.cpgs.cpgs.cpgs.cphK.cphK.cphK.cpwe.cpwe.cpwo.cpwo.cpwo.dBdg.dBdg.dBdg.dBus.dBus.dBus.dC5M.dC5M.dC5M.dCL8.dCL8)**

A midrange deck built around artifacts. This deck sees continued steady performance. And doing reasonably at various tournaments. There appears to be no major variations this week and the deck overall remains solid. Though some knowledge will be required for the best performance on the ladder.

**[Puppet Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.c9hM.c9hM.c9hM.cQnG.cQnG.cQnG.cR2I.cR2I.cR2I.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.cYqk.cYqk.cpC4.cpC4.cpC4.cpRO.cpRO.cpRO.cpRY.cpRY.cpRY.cpwU.cpwU.cpwU.cpwe.cpwe.cpwe.cwWM.cwWM.cwWM.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.dC8U.dC8U.dCK-.dCK-.dCK-)**

A Tempo/Midrange deck built around puppets. This week we see Puppet Portal take a bit of a split. Some decks are definitely aiming for a more tempo oriented approach. This decklist for example being an example of that. Looking to push in a lot of damage while using the puppets to clear out threats. Though there are some still playing more along the lines of the older versions with more expensive followers. We'll have to see if either wins out or if there will be a split of the two .

---

This week sees Rune and Sword still being at the top, though Sword is showing some mild weakness compared to Rune. Which just shows strong performance at all tournaments. Most have some variety with most classes short of dragon appearing in the top 8. SVO Taiwan was an exception with the only 3 classes in the top 8 being Forest, Sword and Rune. Which is a bit concerning. Might just be a fluke though.

At least things appear a little less dire than last week. But still not ideal. And at least we got one new deck and in theory there might be more hiding in the corners.  So we'll have to see.

Until next week. Have fun playing Shadowverse!",27,1754240698.0,Shadowverse,15,0.91,False

I‚Äôm leaning towards not bringing my little camping stove.  I figure I‚Äôll grab food from markets (sandwiches, fruits, etc) and eat at restaurants.  But I really enjoy coffee, so maybe I should take it, if even just for that.

1mgoe5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mgoe5x/does_the_keurig_kexpress_coffee_maker_deliver_on/,Does the Keurig K-Express Coffee Maker Deliver on Convenience?,"Brewing coffee has become an essential part of my daily routine, and testing the Keurig K-Cup was a real treat. It's one of those machines designed for simplicity, speed, and convenience. Despite being a budget-friendly single-serve coffee maker, it doesn't skimp on performance. As someone who enjoys experimenting with different coffee blends, I found it fascinating to explore the versatility that this machine offers. It's sleek and compact, which fits perfectly on my cluttered counter, but there are some caveats to share along the way!

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the Keurig K-Cup caught my attention with its compact and modern design. Measuring just over 6.5 inches wide, it occupies minimal space, making it ideal for smaller kitchens or even an office setup. I liked how the black matte finish gives it a clean, contemporary vibe. The water reservoir, sitting at an ample 36 ounces, is removable, which makes refilling a breeze. Even if you're in a morning rush, the reservoir's easy handling ensures no spills‚Äîtrust me, my groggy self appreciates that! However, the plastic build feels a bit lightweight, which may raise long-term durability concerns.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
Brewing coffee with this machine is ridiculously simple. With just a push of a button, you're ready to enjoy a fresh cup. The controls are intuitive, relying on straightforward buttons for selecting the cup sizes (6, 8, or 10 ounces). I tested back-to-back brewing, and it lived up to its promise‚Äîno waiting time for reheating between cups. This feature is gold for anyone hosting guests or when I needed a quick caffeine fix before my second Zoom meeting of the day. The maintenance alert, reminding you to descale after every 250 brews, is another thoughtful touch, helping to keep the machine in prime condition.

**Positives**  
- Compact size fits small spaces perfectly.  
- Straightforward button controls make brewing foolproof.  
- Back-to-back brewing eliminates delays between cups.  
- Compatible with the My K-Cup universal reusable filter for customization.  

[Check Keurig K-Cup price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0bn9srqt9/)

**Performance and Brewing Quality**  
This machine doesn‚Äôt compromise on the richness of its coffee. Whether I used regular K-Cups or the reusable filter with my favorite ground blend, the taste was excellent‚Äîsmooth and robust, exactly what I needed to kickstart my day. The strong brew feature amped up the flavor when I wanted that extra boldness in my cup. It‚Äôs also relatively fast; each brew only took a matter of minutes. While it‚Äôs great for most instant coffee moments, I did notice variability in temperature. The occasional lukewarm cup was slightly annoying, especially when using larger travel mugs.

**Downsides**  
- Plastic build feels less premium.  
- Temperature consistency could be better.  
- On rare occasions, I encountered splashes during brewing.  

**Coffee Choices and Versatility**  
What sets this machine apart is its wide compatibility with K-Cups from multiple brands. The sheer variety of coffee flavors, tea, and even hot cocoa pods available is impressive. For someone who doesn‚Äôt drink the same coffee every day, this opens up countless possibilities. I also tried the My K-Cup reusable filter for a few eco-friendly runs, and it worked like a charm. Pairing your own freshly ground beans might win over even the pickiest barista in your circle.

**Product Rivals**  
Comparing it to similar single-serve brewers, like the Nespresso Essenza Mini, I noticed that this Keurig machine excels in flexibility thanks to its adaptable use of both regular pods and reusable filters. However, when it comes to espresso or specialty drinks, Nespresso has the upper hand. Another competitor, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, offers the added bonus of a carafe option alongside single servings, but it lacks the speed of this unit. If simplicity and variety are your main priorities, the Keurig edges ahead.

**True Value**  
In terms of cost-effectiveness, the Keurig K-Cup hits the mark for what it offers. It's not loaded with unnecessary bells and whistles, meaning you're paying for functionality that you‚Äôll actually use. This makes it an excellent choice for coffee lovers who need speed and convenience but don‚Äôt want to splurge on premium espresso makers. While the build is less robust than some pricier competitors, its efficiency and versatility make it well worth considering.

1mgodxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1mgodxs/who_cares_about_the_body_when_the_mind_already/,Who cares about the body when the mind already cheated‚Ä¶ right?,"
My boyfriend (M24) and I (F(28) have been together for 3 years (AUG 2023), he has been everything I ever asked for and I can‚Äôt put in words how much I cared about him.

Since day 1 our story was magical to me and we discovered that we were neighbors so we basically started ‚Äúliving together‚Äù since the first week (he was staying 24/7 with me since then). 

He has a lot of different jobs but he found his comfort zone in a lovely coffee shop (JAN 2024) while I was working on an architectural firm during the first years of our relationship until I had to quit and look for another job-I didn‚Äôt find anything for like 3 month so he helped me out and put me in his coffee shop just in another location 

Well guys, I was feeling so loved and so amazed by him I never imagined he was filtering really hard with a coworker and everyone knew except me. 

He confessed to me but he first said it was only attraction (MARCH 2025), and he never spoke or took action on it and I was trying to comfort him saying that feeling attraction for another person is normal and the important thing is how we act on it (remember we have an age gap and I was trying to put myself on his feet). Of course he continuously said the right works and many I loved yous and never blamed me once in this whole story that I‚Äôm about to share.

Later on, a friend called me (APRIL 2025), saying that one day a friend that he had from the coffee shop location that my boyfriend works on asked him if he knew me and if he was really close and if he cares about me he should let me know that my boyfriend almost received a warning / write up about his behavior with this girl and the thing he said to her (AROUND OCTOBER 2024)‚Ä¶

I confronted him and asked him what type of things he said and how many people knew about this if he said he was keeping this feelings to himself and he didn‚Äôt know what to do. At beginning he kept saying that not knowing is going to help me more and I was like ???? You don‚Äôt know what will help me so please tell me. He finally said that he repeated ‚Äúoh Ari I like you so much‚Äù ‚Äúyou have a beautiful smile‚Äù ‚Äúhow much I would like to live with you‚Äù (this one killed me) then I asked him to see the conversation he has with his dad about the situation (because he commented me that he was the only person he spoke about it - also a lie btw) and on the conversation he was explaining to him the attraction topic (not mentioning the continuous attempts of filtering) and at one he said: ‚Äúwhat my girlfriend doesn‚Äôt know is that each day that passes I like my coworker more and more‚Ä¶‚Äù and then I asked him for the conversation with her but he deleted all and claims that it was because his dad told him to move away from her (mind you they have the exact same schedule). Then I asked him to check his Instagram with him and I discovered that one of his other coworkers sent him a reel saying ‚ÄúYou with Ari‚Äù and the reel said something like ‚Äúwhen you can‚Äôt be with the person you really want to be) reel was sent on (SEPT 2024). He deleted her from social networks and everything following advices but I mean‚Ä¶ they still had the same schedule + he also said to me that each morning he would wake up happy just thinking about working with her‚Ä¶

I tried to live with it during the rest of the months thinking ‚Äúwell at least it didn‚Äôt get physical and yeah he was flirting but it was on the limits I guess (my doubts were really the duration on the flirtration but that‚Äôs another thing)

On July he randomly said to me to try to calm me down during one of my ‚Äúfeeling less‚Äù episodes: ‚Äúyo know I never asked her to go out, right?‚Äù And I was like WELL OF COURSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND YOH KNOW? THATA THE BARE MINIMUN OF RESPECT. But then guys I receive information that he, indeed, asked her out many times and she denied (she has a boyfriend and even though I know she loves the attention my boyfriend gives to her - she has more respect for me than him). 

This was the last drop for me but I feel  so bad because I see remorse but still he did this for almost a year (from what I know) and the only reason he didn‚Äôt cheat was because the girl was rejecting him‚Ä¶ I feel devastated. Also what makes my head spins is the fact that he didn‚Äôt care to keep it ‚Äúlow‚Äù he said out loud that he liked her a lot and she wanted to be with her (while everyone knowing he was with someone and also knowing me personally)

An extra thing that killed me: he cooked for her one of her typical dishes of her country just to impress her and I can‚Äôt believe I dated a guy that lied to my face so many times but it confuses me that he confessed to me but I‚Äôve been thinking that he may confessed just because a friend of mine was going to have a training on his location and he just took a step forward to look good‚Ä¶ 

I really truly saw something special on this guy and we talked about marriage, opened and account together and were looking for an apartment üòû I can‚Äôt believe it and I‚Äôm still in shock I can‚Äôt see him as the same person and I can‚Äôt believe a person who praises that he loves me would do this to me. I wanted us to be happy and I thought he was my end game‚Ä¶

I guess I‚Äôm looking for reassurance on my decision and also to know if you consider this as cheating even if it wasn‚Äôt physical

TL;DR: my boyfriend tried everything to conquer a coworker for one year behind my back and everyone knew about it‚Ä¶ Didn‚Äôt get physical but not because of lack of trying‚Ä¶ so don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs his still count as cheating?   ",4,1754240508.0,survivinginfidelity,3,0.83,False
1mgodv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/notcalmmoms/comments/1mgodv6/as_a_working_mom_i_feel_like_im_failing_on_all/,"As a working mom, I feel like I‚Äôm failing on all fronts","**I‚Äôm a mom, I‚Äôm not calm, and‚Ä¶I wish adults got summer break.**



There are two phrases that make regular appearances in my life. The first is spoken by my daughter: ‚ÄúMama, why are you *always* in a meeting?‚Äù The second comes out of my own mouth:¬† ‚ÄúSorry team, I‚Äôm dialing in from the car because I‚Äôm picking up/dropping off my kids.‚Äù



‚ÄúWork-life balance‚Äù can feel like a throwaway phrase, but in practice, it‚Äôs brutal. Each time my daughter asks me why I work so much, it‚Äôs like a knife to my heart ‚Äî and every time I feel like I‚Äôm not giving my work my focused attention, I feel like a failure.

These feelings of inadequacy came to a head when summer kicked off and my Instagram feed was filled with posts like ‚Äú50 Screen-Free Activities for Your Kid‚Äù and sappy montage videos telling me how fast these early years fly by. (Did *you* know you only have 18 summers with your child?!)

But I let out a primal scream of rage and burst into tears when another mom in my community posted that she was looking forward to spending ‚Äúeach summer day‚Äù with her little ones. She added that to be ‚Äúreally present in each moment‚Äù with them, she was signing off of social media for a while.

I would love to be ‚Äúpresent‚Äù with my children. I would love not to be struggling to balance my meetings with their schedule. And even though my daughter loves all her summer camps, I‚Äôd *love* to be the one creating those fun activities with her and soaking up every moment. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to outsource ‚Äúsummer fun‚Äù to other people (and pay out the nose for it).

American society is not set up to support parents overall, and definitely not for two parents who have to work outside the home to survive. I know this. I know it‚Äôs hard for all of us. *I know better*‚Ä¶ but sometimes those feelings of inadequacy overwhelm me.

**One thing that worked for me:** Creating special summer time moments with my kid even with my limited schedule. I personally like to take my daughter to our local coffee shop. I have a coffee and she has a croissant, and we bask in the sun and giggle and make jokes.¬†

In our early 20s, our friendship revolved around going out, having fun and meeting girls. As we got into relationships and grew up, we leaned more into cars, video games and the gym. As time went on, he started losing interest in cars and the gym and I lost interest in video games. We were at a bit of a stand still but we would still go out a grab coffee once in a while. Sometimes, Id suggest actually sitting down in a coffee shop rather than in his car. He usually declines. Eventually I started seeing him less and less as he reverted to staying home every single weekend. 

Trying to be a good friend, I commented that his sedentary lifestyle might be a symptom of depression. He disagreed. He feels fine. He just doesnt want to do anything. Fair enough. Im somewhat of an introvert myself. 

Now in our 30s, Ive realized that ive spent the majority of my time wanting to plan things with my friend only for him to decline last minute. 

Obviously i cant force him to go out. But its putting a strain on our friendship and honestly, making my life pretty boring. 

Yes, I should go out and make friends. Not super easy as an introvert in his 30s, but i know thats the answer. 

It‚Äôs unfortunate to want to enjoy life with your bestfriend, only to be met with disappointment constantly.

1mgob1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/BicycleArea/comments/1mgob1f/should_you_buy_the_engwe_t14_electric_bike_review/,Should You Buy the ENGWE T14 Electric Bike Review for Urban Commuting?,"Compact, capable, and ready to tackle urban commutes, the ENGWE T14 Electric Bike (item model number T14) offers a mix of convenience and innovation ideal for city dwellers or casual riders. Testing it daily for various errands and joyrides revealed its strengths and subtle quirks. With a 350W (peaking at 600W) motor and a 48V 10Ah lithium battery, this urban commuter bike makes you feel like you‚Äôre gliding through traffic. But there‚Äôs more (and a bit less) to it than first meets the eye. Here's a deeper dive!

**Exceptional Performance and Range**  
Nothing beats the thrill of effortlessly buzzing through traffic. With a top speed of 20 mph and a range of up to 22 miles in full-electric mode (or 37.2 miles in pedal-assist mode), I found this bike to be reliable across daily rides and grocery errands. The three riding modes‚ÄîFully Electric, Pedal Assist, and traditional Pedal‚Äîoffer flexibility for various needs. Personally, I leaned toward Pedal Assist mode for zipping around the city without breaking a sweat. However, the realistic range might be somewhat influenced by factors like rider weight and terrain.

**Compact Folding Design for Busy Lifestyles**  
Living in a packed urban area, space is always a premium, and the T14‚Äôs foldable design feels heaven-sent. Folding and storing the bike under my apartment staircase or tucking it into the trunk of my car was refreshingly effortless. Its portability became particularly handy when I had to pop into coffee shops or other small spaces. At 63 pounds, it‚Äôs manageable, but carrying it too far could feel like an upper-body workout. Its overall construction, though sturdy, might not appeal to someone looking for ultralight models.

**Key Benefits**  
- Convenient foldable design suitable for tight storage spaces.  
- Versatility with three distinct riding modes tailored to diverse commuting styles.  
- High-powered motor for seamless acceleration and enhanced hill-climbing ability.  
- Long battery life, perfect for moderate daily commutes.  

**Comfort-First Riding Experience**  
Comfort on the T14 goes beyond expectations. The multiple shock absorption system‚Äîincluding front fork, center suspension, rear wheel, and saddle‚Äîsoaks up the brunt of bumpy roads. Despite attempting to navigate pothole-ridden stretches, I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth the ride felt. Adjustable handlebars and a soft saddle allowed me to fine-tune the bike to my preferences. That said, at 14 inches, the wheels are rather small for my taste, especially when navigating uneven streets.

**Negatives to Consider**  
- At 63 pounds, portability is limited.  
- Small 14-inch wheels might feel less stable on rougher terrains compared to larger-wheeled options.  
- Despite advertised puncture-proof tires, occasional air pressure checks are necessary.  

**Robust Build and Sleek Aesthetics**  
Durability is one of the T14‚Äôs standout features. The carbon steel frame feels solid, its dual suspension tolerates road shocks effectively, and the iron wheel material certainly adds to build resilience. The modern gray color suits the urban aesthetic well. However, I noticed minor scratches after a couple of weeks, which could bug those picky about visual wear.

**Competing Brands**  
I‚Äôve tested similar budget-friendly e-bikes, such as the Ancheer Folding Frame Electric Bike and Swagtron EB7 Plus. Unlike the Engwe T14, Ancheer‚Äôs battery range feels underwhelming, while the Swagtron EB7 edges out with its lighter build. On price-to-performance, the T14 is sturdier and more versatile if you don‚Äôt mind the trade-off in portability due to its slightly heavier weight.

**Affordable Quality**  
Is it worth owning over other bikes in its class? The answer is a confident yes, especially if urban commuting, comfort, and affordability are priorities. More advanced models might offer additional features, but not all hit that sweet spot the way the ENGWE T14 does. There‚Äôs enough bang for the buck here to satisfy most city commuters.

The first question people ask me is why I go to college. Why would a successful writer, who already has a communications degree, go back to school, even a community college? Honestly? I like the activity. Before my books found their way onto the shelves, I was a lawn care technician and then after that I was a caretaker at a large conference center not far away from Boston. Even after I could have supported myself through writing alone, I kept working because I enjoyed it. Writing is hard and as much as I love it, I needed a break sometimes.



I‚Äôd probably be working on the side there at the conference center even now if that tree hadn‚Äôt smashed my leg. Now I‚Äôm not much good at anything other than writing or sitting in conferences. So, without anything else to occupy my time, I decided that I‚Äôd take some classes at the local community college. Folklore, just so I could write it off for research purposes. I don‚Äôt have many people that care about me, and most of them seem to think that any time I‚Äôm not writing or doing research is a waste of time. Ironically, some of these same people thought that writing was a waste of time before it started paying.



The college isn‚Äôt too far away from my house, a little cottage on one of the many islands on the beautiful Maine coast. A half hour drive through a peaceful harbor town and the campus just happens to be right beside my favorite coffee shop. Well, my favorite coffee shop that isn‚Äôt part of a bookstore anyway.



I‚Äôd driven to the coffee shop countless times, enough that I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the line that usually led out the front door this time of morning. I really don‚Äôt know what made me look today, but I did. There was a girl, maybe the second to last person in the line. She looked up as I drove past and her eyes met mine. I almost went up on the curb before I caught myself. Her eyes were purple, so bright that they seemed to glow, even in the sunlight. So bright that I couldn‚Äôt get them out of my head until I put my truck into park and climbed out. Being twenty six and walking with a cane, pretty much makes you forget everything except for the looks you get as you hobble around. Even makes you forget the most stunning eyes you‚Äôve ever seen in your life.



‚ÄúHey! Hey, Barnabas!‚Äù



I turned around, leaning heavily on my cane as my bad knee threatened to buckle. ‚ÄúHey Dave. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù Dave was one of my classmates, one of an impressive sum of eleven people that had signed up for a class on folklore. ‚ÄúStill stuck on that research project?‚Äù



He nodded, his face screwing into a frown. ‚ÄúYeah. Can you believe that he gave us a project in our first week?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong with that?‚Äù I asked as we wandered closer to one of the college‚Äôs side buildings. ‚ÄúAt least it‚Äôs interesting.‚Äù



Dave opened the door, holding it open, ignoring my pained sigh. ‚ÄúYeah I guess so. Did you hear we got a new person joining class today? I guess she got here late.‚Äù He grinned. ‚ÄúSo, do you think she‚Äôll be hot?‚Äù



‚ÄúMaybe if you paid more attention to the assignments than girls you wouldn‚Äôt get stuck on a project in the first week of class,‚Äù I grunted, rolling my eyes as I set up my laptop. ‚ÄúDid you even choose an urban legend to research? All you have to do is tell him what it is and what state it came from.‚Äù I narrowed my eyes before the kid could respond. ‚ÄúAnd before you say bigfoot, remember that we all have to choose a different legend and that everyone‚Äôs first choice is going to be bigfoot.‚Äù



Dave groaned and slumped over. ‚ÄúAw, come on! All I needed to know is where the legend started! I can‚Äôt figure out which one is the right one.‚Äù



Before I could respond, the door opened and I felt the hair on the back of my neck begin to prickle. I turned around and nearly fell out of my chair.¬†



The girl from the coffee house was standing in the doorway, her bright, violet eyes searching the room. They locked on mine and time seemed to stop as those beautiful, terrible orbs swallowed me whole. All I could see was fire and those eyes.



She blinked and looked away and I was free, but I still couldn‚Äôt take my eyes off of her as she slipped into a corner seat near the window. Her eyes flickered back to me, her lips turning down in a frown, and I looked away in a panic, my heart feeling like it would beat out of my chest. Dave noticed the sweat beading on my forehead and chuckled.



‚ÄúI thought you were a big shot writer,‚Äù he said, nudging me with his elbow. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you guys the rock stars of the book world?‚Äù His shoulders shook with barely repressed laughter. ‚ÄúDude, she floored you just by walking in. She didn‚Äôt even smile. I thought girls would flirt with you all the time because you‚Äôre famous. Isn‚Äôt that what‚Äôs supposed to happen?‚Äù



‚ÄúOnly in the movies,‚Äù I grunted, trying to steady my erratic pulse. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt think anyone would call me famous.‚Äù



‚ÄúI mean she‚Äôs pretty enough I guess,‚Äù Dave said, glancing back at the girl as more of our classmates filed in. ‚ÄúFunny eyes though. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a blue like that before.‚Äù



‚ÄúPurple,‚Äù I blurted out, without quite knowing why. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not blue, they‚Äôre purple.‚Äù



He stared at me. ‚ÄúI think you need to get your eyes checked man. Hey, can I use your computer before the prof gets here? I need to figure something else out.‚Äù



‚ÄúTry looking up the wampus cat,‚Äù I said, sliding my laptop over to him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think anyone else would have thought of that one.‚Äù¬†



Eleven people could be surprisingly loud and I could barely focus as I waited for the professor to arrive. The girl in the corner was almost magnetic and I kept glancing her way. She looked up once, still frowning as her brilliant eyes met mine. I tried to tear my gaze away before they consumed me a second time, but the strange feeling never came. She turned back to her desk as the teacher, a new professor just a few years older than myself, burst through the doors, already launching into his lecture. For a few minutes I almost forgot about her.



‚ÄúAnd now a word from our celebrity student, Barnabas Rayne,‚Äù said the professor, shocking me out of my stupor. ‚ÄúThat is if he‚Äôs willing to tell us a little bit about his research.‚Äù



Even though I wasn‚Äôt looking at her, I could suddenly feel a pair of eyes on the back of my head, sending goosebumps up and down my arms. The professor waited patiently as I struggled to find my voice again. Finally I just nodded and stood up just a little too quickly. My knee twinged painfully and almost fell, catching myself on the table at the last second. I could feel my face burning red as I glanced at her. Her face was impassive, but her eyes were narrowed and I could see the tendons standing out on her slender hands. I took a deep breath and grabbed my cane, leaning on it heavily as I limped up to the front of the room.



I‚Äôve never liked public speaking, but seeing as I seemed to be a popular choice as a guest speaker, I‚Äôd found ways to cope with the fear. I‚Äôd begun to call it letting the writer out, and for the next fifteen minutes I did, using research examples from my books to illustrate the professor‚Äôs lesson. Up here at the front of the class I had an excuse to look at her. She was hunched over her desk, her hands clasped under her chin, her eyes locked on me, measuring me. I suppressed a shiver and looked away, struggling to concentrate on the center of the room.



‚ÄúThanks Mr. Rayne,‚Äù said the professor as I finished, patting me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúMaybe you should be the one teaching this class.‚Äù



I shook my head, eager to get back to my seat. ‚ÄúNo thanks Dr. Gregory. I think I‚Äôll leave it to you. Suits you better I think.‚Äù



Off in the corner the girl‚Äôs lip curled in what might have been a smirk.



When the class finally ended it was a relief. I got up as quickly as I dared, my cane tapping the floor as I hurried out, chased by the feeling of eyes on my back. Dave hurried after me, already drilling me with questions about the wampus cat. We had only been classmates for a short time, but the now familiar barrage of questions was a pleasant distraction.



‚ÄúWhat did Prof. Gregory say the new girl‚Äôs name was?‚Äù he asked suddenly, catching me off guard. ‚ÄúMac‚ÄôDonald or something‚Ä¶‚Äù



‚ÄúMacTyre,‚Äù I said automatically. I looked around, suddenly worried that she was standing behind me. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt say her first name.‚Äù The door to the parking lot offered a convenient escape and I slipped past him. ‚ÄúSee you later Dave. I‚Äôll send you a good link for the homework.‚Äù



There was still more than an hour before the school cafeteria opened for lunch and if I drove home now I was faced with empty cupboards and my own abysmal cooking ability. The ocean wasn‚Äôt far away, just on the other side of a park just across the street from campus. I could almost hear the sound of waves calling my name. There‚Äôs a reason writers have always been drawn to the sea and besides my own porch, there was a bench down by the water that was my favorite spot to write. I usually drove down, easier on my knee that way, but today I felt like walking. Maybe the walk would clear my head a little bit. I took the scenic route down by the water‚Äôs edge, taking my time on the pebbled beach. My knee ached abominably as I walked, using the sturdy cane as a crutch, but the sunlight shining on the water and the passing boats made the effort worth it. There was a short climb up rough stairs to my bench and I was almost there before I realized it was already occupied.¬†



She looked up over her book, noticing me at almost the same time I noticed her. Those purple eyes widened slightly and she snorted something under her breath that I couldn‚Äôt quite hear.



‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I blurted out, almost in a panic. ‚ÄúAre you following me or am I following you?‚Äù



The girl raised an eyebrow and my panic grew.



‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I babbled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told I have a quirky charm‚Ä¶ ah‚Ä¶ I should‚Ä¶.‚Äù I sighed and started to turn away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you read.‚Äù



‚ÄúNo,‚Äù she said softly, speaking for the first time. She slid away from me, down to the end of the bench. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs room for you too.‚Äù



Her voice was soft and melodious and suddenly I imagined her singing on a stage, enthralling packed stadiums. I shook myself and sat down beside her, avoiding her intense gaze. I coughed uncomfortably. ‚ÄúThanks Miss MacTyre. If you haven‚Äôt noticed, I‚Äôm not all that good at talking.‚Äù



‚ÄúMelody,‚Äù she said, ignoring my attempt at an apology. ‚ÄúCall me Melody.‚Äù



‚ÄúMelody,‚Äù I repeated. Of course. I shot her a sideways glance. Her brilliant eyes were as distracting as ever, but I finally began to see past them. Her hair was dark, almost black and was pulled back into a simple braid, messy, but still somehow the most beautiful I‚Äôd ever seen. Her skin was light, the color of cream, making her violet eyes seem even brighter. Her shapely lips moved and I shook myself, barely catching her words.



‚ÄúI had you pegged for a writer,‚Äù she said, closing her book and setting it on her lap. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt expect you to be Barnabas Rayne though.‚Äù Her eyes narrowed slightly and I had an unsettling feeling that she was measuring me yet again. ‚ÄúYour books don‚Äôt have pictures‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not quite like I imagined.‚Äù



I swallowed, unnerved by her unblinking stare. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ is that a good thing or a bad thing?‚Äù



She shrugged. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt decided yet. I‚Äôll leave you to your writing.‚Äù She smiled slightly and I felt my heart skip a beat. ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôll ask for some research help after next class.‚Äù



I tried to speak, to invite her to stay, but she was already gone, walking away up the hill with the grace of a dancer. She looked back once, I saw a flash of her incredible eyes, and then she vanished into the trees by the road. I took out my notebook and tried to write, only to give up in frustration a few minutes later. My latest story was only in its infancy, barely a rough draft and only pages away from its conclusion. The plan was solid and the writing should have been easy, but my thoughts were too scrambled by my strange new classmate to focus on anything for more than a few seconds at a time. All I knew was that my main character was suddenly looking a lot like Melody.¬†



The walk back to my truck was shorter and easier on my knee than the hike along the shore. The cafeteria would be open now, but I decided that the island store near my house was a better choice. The meatball subs were better there and the privacy of my house appealed to me far more than the crowded dining hall. The store was on the opposite side of the island from my house, adding almost fifteen minutes to the drive. The day was clear though and the roads nearly empty and the sound of the engine and the tires on the road was soothing. By the time I got home, Melody was nearly out of my mind. Nearly.



Driving down my short driveway, shaded by dozens of evergreens before it opened up on the town harbor, it was hard to forget how lucky I‚Äôd been. I‚Äôd built the big house when I moved, using the earnings from my first bestseller and more. Not that it was much bigger than the single apartment above the garage that had come with the land in the first place. Still, it was more than big enough for me and Clue, my big, dog-like Maine Coon. My father had visited once before he died, but since then the apartment had been standing empty. I‚Äôd never had much in the way of family, or even friends for that matter, but now, for the first time in months, I found myself feeling lonely.¬†



‚ÄúMaybe I should rent it out,‚Äù I thought absently, knowing already that I didn‚Äôt mean it. An unbidden vision of violet eyes staring out the apartment window popped into my head and I groaned, dropping my head to the steering wheel. I‚Äôd had crushes before in high school, and even one in college when I went the first time, but this didn‚Äôt feel like any of them. It certainly didn‚Äôt feel like love at first sight‚Ä¶ actually, a not so small part of me, the overactive imagination that was the source of my stories, almost believed that Melody MacTyre could kill me with a look. That first look, when her eyes filled my head with fire, had nearly put me flat on the floor.¬†¬†



The wind picked up and I pushed the memory away, listening to the crash of the surf as I limped to the door. Clue met me in the kitchen as usual, rubbing around my ankles as I snatched up a plate and fell into the couch by my wide front window. The bay stretched out into endless ocean beyond the rocks, the shimmering waters broken only by islands and lobster boats.



The sub, one of my favorite indulgences, warmed my stomach and the soothing sound of a cat purring loosened the knots in my head. With the words finally flowing from my pen to the page, I quickly lost track of time. I think I stopped once to get something to eat, but I can‚Äôt remember. What I do remember is waking up the next morning, still in the clothes that I had on the day before. My notebook was on the floor beside the couch, a convenient bed for Clue‚Äôs fluffy bulk. It was late in the summer, just before the start of fall, and the sun had just risen over the horizon. I got up and hobbled to the kitchen, deciding to leave my cane behind. I didn‚Äôt have class today and I knew I had to write, but as my morning coffee began to brew I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder if Melody would be at the college. It was distracting.



The day passed slowly as I fought to find the groove I had last night. I never quite found it, but I still got more done than I thought I would. Porpoises went by my window once, not an unusual sight by any means, and for the first time, I wished I had someone to share the sight with.¬†



Would it be cliche to say that when I finally went to bed, this time in my room, that I dreamed about Melody? It happens in almost every romance novel ever written, but I guess that doesn‚Äôt make it any less real. It wasn‚Äôt quite like in the books though, and it didn‚Äôt last very long. It was just the instant she walked through the door and looked at me. This time though she was a giant, a titanic angel looking down on me from above. She smiled once, right before I woke up, and my dreamscape dissolved in lavender flame.



I drove to town in a daze and wandered into the classroom holding a coffee that I didn‚Äôt remember getting. Dave, my usual companion, was nowhere to be seen, but my heart quickened when I saw Melody sitting in her corner. She looked up as I took my seat and her lips curved in a smile as she gave a polite nod. I tried to get up again but her smile stole away all the strength from my legs as the rest of the class stormed in with Dr. Gregory.



‚ÄúBarny!‚Äù cried Dave as he plopped into the chair beside me. ‚ÄúHow‚Äôs it going man?‚Äù



I could see Melody‚Äôs eyes widen in amusement at the look of chagrin on my face.



‚ÄúBarnabas,‚Äù I corrected wearily as Melody‚Äôs shoulders began to shake with laughter. ‚ÄúI told you, just call me Barnabas.‚Äù



‚ÄúSorry man,‚Äù Dave said, completely unaware of the purple eyes watching us. ‚ÄúHey, thanks for sending me that link. I didn‚Äôt know that the wampus cat stories were so interesting.‚Äù



He kept talking but I lost interest, nodding along half heartedly until Dr. Gregory began the lesson. It wasn‚Äôt anything I hadn‚Äôt heard before and I spent more time writing story notes than class notes. I looked over at the corner a few minutes before the bell and my heart sank. Melody was gone.



I escaped from Dave‚Äôs endless questions and limped out to the parking lot. A bright spot of color on the windshield caught my eye and I pulled the note out from under one of the wipers. The paper was the color of lilac and the penmanship was elegant.

  


Barnabas,



Sorry I missed you in class.¬† Meet for coffee tomorrow?



M

  


My head spun. I hadn‚Äôt even expected her to talk to me again and here I was holding a note asking me to meet for coffee.

¬†

\*



I wasn‚Äôt the first one in the coffee shop but it was close. Thankfully my favorite chair was open and I settled back with my notebook, keeping one anxious eye on the door. Melody‚Äôs note hadn‚Äôt given a time and minutes began to feel like hours as I waited. Then, suddenly, she was there, standing beside my table. She smiled at my shock and sat down, folding her hands on the table in front of her.



‚ÄúCan I get you anything?‚Äù I choked after a moment. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even see you come in.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a caramel latte,‚Äù she said easily as I climbed to my feet. ‚ÄúOr anything sweet.‚Äù



By the time I got back to the seat, she had moved her chair around the table next to the window. She had a book open on her lap but she wasn‚Äôt reading. Instead she was looking out the window, watching the traffic on the road and the boats on the water beyond.



‚ÄúI can see why you‚Äôd like to write here,‚Äù she said without looking at me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs beautiful.‚Äù Her eyes flashed in the light as she turned to look at me again. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a talent for writing, but if I did I think I would have to steal your table.‚Äù



‚ÄúI think I would have to let you,‚Äù I said as I gave her her cup. ‚ÄúCaramel latte. Best in town, but I think you already knew that.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh?‚Äù she asked. Her smile remained steady but her eyes were suddenly wary.



I chuckled nervously, nearly dropping my cane as I sat down. ‚ÄúI saw you standing here in line the other day before class. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard of someone who doesn‚Äôt like this place enough to come back.‚Äù



‚ÄúOh yes,‚Äù she said, testing her drink. ‚ÄúThat was the first time we saw each other wasn‚Äôt it. I was surprised to see you in class.‚Äù She leaned forward before I could answer. ‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôre a successful writer with a working man‚Äôs truck. I don‚Äôt know many authors that plow their own snow.‚Äù



‚ÄúI can‚Äôt exactly use a shovel very well anymore,‚Äù I said, patting my leg. ‚ÄúSo I trade off with my neighbors. I plow their driveway and they shovel my porch.‚Äù I cocked my head to the side. ‚ÄúHow did you know that I used it for plowing?‚Äù



Her musical laugh made my head swim. ‚ÄúI lived in Alaska for a while. I know a working plow truck when I see one.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow long were you up there?‚Äù



‚ÄúOh, no,‚Äù she said, wagging a slender finger as her eyes sparkled playfully. ‚ÄúI invited you here, remember? I get to ask the questions.‚Äù She grinned at my stunned silence. ‚ÄúSo why are you here? Why take a class in folklore?‚Äù



I shrugged. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something to do. I grew up on a farm‚Ä¶ it feels wrong not to be doing something with my time.‚Äù



‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt writing your job now?‚Äù Melody asked in confusion. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that doing something?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I hesitated and stroked my beard. ‚ÄúI guess. I used to write in my spare time when I was working on maintenance at the conference center. I worked there part time after I got published, until the accident took out my knee.‚Äù My fingers drummed on the table, a nervous tic I‚Äôd never quite been able to get rid of. ‚ÄúSometimes I need a break from writing and now sitting and listening is pretty much all I can do.‚Äù



‚ÄúToo bad about your knee,‚Äù she said sadly. ‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúTree fell the wrong way,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt really know how, but it did. One of the limbs snapped off and hit me in the leg. Just about took it off.‚Äù The memory alone made my battered joint ache and I rubbed it absently. ‚ÄúTook a while to get back on my feet, but that‚Äôs about as far as I‚Äôll ever get. Got a cool cane out of it at least.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs elegant,‚Äù Melody said, admiring the polished metal handle. ‚ÄúSeems to suit you. Still, it‚Äôs a shame you need it.‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad that it wasn‚Äôt my hand. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do if I wasn‚Äôt able to write. I‚Äôm not exactly good at talk to text. Besides, it won‚Äôt work with dialogue.‚Äù



Her eyes turned sad for a moment, but her smile returned, brighter than ever. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre still writing too. I really like your books.‚Äù



I felt my face begin to redden at her praise and I looked away. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always nice to meet a fan.‚Äù Her violet eyes caught me again and I swallowed. ‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ listen, would you like to do this again sometime? Maybe have some dinner?‚Äù



Her smile faded and I felt a sharp prick of pain in my gut as she sighed. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not such a good idea.‚Äù



She slid her book closer to me and I looked at it for the first time. It was *Among the Pines*, my first novel. ‚ÄúI promised myself a long time ago that I would get a signature from every author I met,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúWould you be kind enough to lend yours to my collection?‚Äù



I nodded, unable to speak around the sudden lump in my throat. I could feel my hand shaking as I pulled out my pen, threatening to make my already messy signature even worse.



‚ÄúHere,‚Äù I said after a moment. ‚ÄúI have a few signed copies of my others laying around.‚Äù I laughed uncomfortably and ran a hand through my hair. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd be happy to donate them to your collection too if you want. And I‚Äôm not trying to buy a date either, I swear.‚Äù



My breath caught in my chest as her pretty face twisted in an expression I couldn‚Äôt quite place. Finally she dipped her head.



‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll take you up on that,‚Äù she half whispered as she got up to leave. ‚ÄúIt was nice talking to you Barnabas. See you tomorrow.‚Äù



I meant to get up, to open the door for her, but my muscles stubbornly refused to move as I watched her slip away and vanish out the door. I drove home in a daze. The next day was hard, though god help me I don‚Äôt know why. Melody smiled when I gave her the books after class, but it never reached her eyes. So vastly different than when we had been talking in the coffee shop. Those brilliant, frightening eyes were cool and flat, their sparkle carefully hidden.



\*



I spoke to her a few times as the weeks passed, but that look never left. It bothered me more than I wanted to admit, more than it should have. Writing helped, and I threw myself into my project. Even fighting through writer‚Äôs block helped a little, though I kept having to remind myself that my character didn‚Äôt have purple eyes. Before long it was autumn and my book was done. Editing was always more difficult for me than writing, and to make matters worse I started seeing Melody more and more in my comings and goings through town. Once, I even thought I saw her driving a boat just off the point in front of my house.



Late October found me in the park again, driven from my house by long hours of editing. I was reading for a change, instead of writing, and soaking in the rapidly cooling sunlight. It wasn‚Äôt too cold, not yet, though the chill from the ocean breeze had me in a light jacket. Compared to the fall tourists shivering in their winter coats, I guess I was doing pretty well.



A shadow fell over my book and I looked up, only to drop it in shock. Melody stooped down and picked it up, brushing the dirt off the cover.



‚ÄúInteresting choice,‚Äù she said, handing it back as she sat down. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt have you pegged for a romance guy. You missed class today, are you alright?‚Äù



My eyes widened and I grabbed for my phone only to remember that I had left it at home. I groaned and leaned back on the bench. ‚ÄúI thought today was Tuesday‚Ä¶. When did Wednesday get here?‚Äù



‚ÄúAbout eleven hours ago,‚Äù she replied with a soft chuckle, a little bit of life leaking through her guarded eyes. Her chin jerked at the book in my lap. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have your laptop today. Tired of editing?‚Äù



I nodded, suddenly realizing just how weary I was. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I guess I was working all night.‚Äù I rubbed my eyes, fighting back a yawn. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt the first time. Once I spent an entire week two days behind. I only realized it when I went to church and no one was there.‚Äù



Melody‚Äôs eyes searched my face. ‚ÄúYou look like you need coffee. Want to get some?‚Äù



My heart twinged as I remembered our last coffee house encounter. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ last time I‚Äôm pretty sure I offended you or something. I don‚Äôt really want to do that again.‚Äù



Her eyes widened and her face fell as a profound sense of sadness washed over me. ‚ÄúYou thought that you offended me?‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah, I guess,‚Äù I replied. ‚ÄúI mean it felt like it. I‚Äôve never sent someone running from the room before.‚Äù



She reached out and touched my shoulder. Her hand was warm, even through my jacket, and for an instant my world filled with fire again. Her fingers tightened in a gentle squeeze and the fires went away.



‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt offend me Barnabas‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just a little complicated.‚Äù Her smile returned, as full and open as it had been weeks before. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you let me make it up to you?‚Äù Her eyes went to my book and her smile turned to a teasing smirk. ‚ÄúSo is that research or a guilty pleasure?‚Äù



I felt my ears begin to heat up as she stood and held out my cane.



¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a paranormal romance‚Ä¶ just one step over from fantasy,‚Äù I said, embarrassment making my voice unsteady. ‚ÄúBesides, people are too hard on this series. She did something right, or it wouldn‚Äôt have been so successful.‚Äù



‚ÄúVery true,‚Äù she said mildly, helping me to my feet. ‚ÄúBut I think I like her latest work the best.‚Äù



‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I asked as we climbed the hill back to my truck. ‚ÄúIs she part of your collection?‚Äù



‚ÄúShe was,‚Äù Melody replied, her look turning sour. ‚ÄúI met her at a book fair a couple of years ago, but I lost her book and a bunch of others in a fire last winter.‚Äù



I winced. ‚ÄúOh, sorry. What happened?‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt I tell you about it when we get to the coffee shop,‚Äù she said. Her eyes looked me over. ‚ÄúMaybe I should drive, at least until we get some caffeine in you.‚Äù



I started to protest, but her smile and striking eyes hit me full force, sending my mind reeling. I held out my keys and she hopped easily into the driver‚Äôs seat, waiting patiently as I limped around to the other side. The engine roared to life as I closed my door and she pulled out into the road, her driving nearly as graceful as her walking.



‚ÄúI could have walked,‚Äù I said dumbly, still reeling from the combined might of her presence and my lack of sleep. ‚ÄúIt wouldn‚Äôt have been any trouble.‚Äù



Her eyes met mine as she pulled into the coffee shop‚Äôs parking lot. ‚ÄúIt looked like your knee was bothering you today. I don‚Äôt want to be the reason you‚Äôre stuck in bed tomorrow.‚Äù She put the truck in park and handed me my keys. ‚ÄúBesides, I parked over here anyway.‚Äù



This time I actually beat her to the door. ‚ÄúWhat did I miss in class today?‚Äù



She shrugged and sauntered to the counter. ‚ÄúI have a feeling we didn‚Äôt hear anything that you don‚Äôt already know. Iced coffee right?‚Äù



I nodded and stumped over to my booth as she waited for the drinks. My head was still spinning by the time she sat down.



‚ÄúI believe I owe you some questions,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI promise I won‚Äôt run out on you this time.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou said you had a fire,‚Äù I started after a moment. ‚ÄúWhat happened? How‚Äôd you get from Alaska to here?‚Äù



‚ÄúThe fire was an accident,‚Äù she said softly, tapping her nails on the table. ‚ÄúI came home one day and my house was burning‚Ä¶ along with most of my stuff.‚Äù She sighed. ‚ÄúI used what I got from the insurance to move to Florida and get a house.‚Äù



‚ÄúA house? If you have a house in Florida, why are you in Maine?‚Äù



Melody smiled and waggled her eyebrows. ‚ÄúYou can go anywhere you want when¬† your house floats.‚Äù



I couldn‚Äôt help but feel a quick flash of envy. ‚ÄúA houseboat‚Ä¶ I wish I had thought of that.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not all it‚Äôs cracked up to be,‚Äù she snorted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know about other boats but mine is kind of hard to heat. At this rate I‚Äôll need to find someplace else to stay for the winter.‚Äù



‚ÄúI have an apartment above my garage,‚Äù I said, regretting the words the moment they left my lips. The chilly, guarded look came back to her eyes and I started to babble an apology, but she held up her hands, looking away for a long moment. When she finally raised her head, the cold was gone.



‚ÄúDoes it have room for a collection?‚Äù she asked with a weary smile. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have as much as I used to, but I‚Äôm working on it.‚Äù



‚ÄúI thought you collected books,‚Äù I said, deciding that telling her how big the space was might be a mistake. ‚ÄúHow much space can books really take?‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôd be surprised.‚Äù She sipped her drink, today a sweet iced coffee like mine. ‚ÄúStories are my favorite thing to collect, but I collect art too‚Ä¶ some antique weapons even.‚Äù Her eyes met mine and she shrugged. ‚ÄúReally anything that catches my eye I guess.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow much did you lose?‚Äù



‚ÄúAll but a couple of books and an old sword,‚Äù she said sadly. ‚ÄúThe book you signed for me was one of them actually. But it‚Äôs okay. Just gives me a chance to find it all again.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy a folklore class then?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAnd why here?‚Äù



‚ÄúThese classes are a good place to find new books,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúAnd I liked the heat in Florida, but I missed the seasons changing. Besides, I‚Äôve always liked New England.‚Äù



I looked out the window, watching the bright leaves falling from the trees.¬† ‚ÄúI used to come up here when I was a kid. First chance I got, I moved here and now it‚Äôs hard to imagine leaving.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never even wanted to travel?‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that,‚Äù I said quickly. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind traveling and I do it quite a lot on my book tours, but something‚Äôs always pulled me back here.‚Äù



She cocked her head. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù



I fiddled with my straw. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm supposed to be a writer so¬† you‚Äôd think that I could find the words a little easier.‚Äù The silver head of my cane flashed in the light from the window as I spun it between my hands. ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôm waiting for something here. And if I go away for too long I‚Äôll miss it.‚Äù



‚ÄúMiss what?‚Äù



I shrugged my shoulders, suddenly feeling like I could drown in her eyes. ‚ÄúI have no idea. It‚Äôs just a feeling I get sometimes.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou should trust your feelings then,‚Äù she said after a moment. ‚ÄúEven if they don‚Äôt make sense. There‚Äôs more to the world than what we think we know.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat sounds like it should be my line.‚Äù



Melody grinned. ‚ÄúYou know how real stories are. You‚Äôve written enough of them. It‚Äôs your job to question the way things are.‚Äù



I nodded, more at ease than I‚Äôd felt in a long time. ‚ÄúYou know what I wish? I wish that the things that exist in books existed in real life. Not everything, but the good things‚Ä¶ like magic, and dragons, and love at first sight.‚Äù



‚ÄúDragons?‚Äù she asked, an odd look on her face. ‚ÄúI thought that dragons were usually the villains.‚Äù She tugged absently on the sleeves of her grey sweater, pulling them farther over her slender hands. ‚ÄúYou know, the knight fights the dragon to save the princess?‚Äù



I shook my head. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean giant fire breathing lizards that just act like animals, I mean the magical dragons‚Ä¶ like from the Dragonlance books. The silver ones that helped people.‚Äù



Melody pursed her lips. ‚ÄúGood dragons still mean there will be bad dragons. And what if they‚Äôre more like the dragons Tolkien created? Ultimate villains?‚Äù



I tapped the book I still had in my jacket pocket. ‚ÄúHey, if vampires can decide to be good, I‚Äôm sure dragons could too.‚Äù



For once, I seemed to be the one to have stunned her. Finally she just shook her head and laughed. ‚ÄúI guess I can‚Äôt really¬† argue with that. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll touch the love at first sight thing, but don‚Äôt you believe in magic? In miracles?‚Äù



‚ÄúMiracles sure,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really think they‚Äôre the same thing as magic though.‚Äù I hesitated, pulling at my beard in thought. ‚ÄúI guess I just mean supernatural abilities. Like those superhero stories you hear on the internet sometimes‚Ä¶ the godlings?‚Äù



‚ÄúGodlings?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúLike that guy who supposedly stopped some terrorists by throwing their truck into the river? The Patriot or whatever people called him?‚Äù



I nodded eagerly. ‚ÄúYeah. No one really knows whether he exists or not, but there‚Äôs so many stories about him that something incredible had to have happened. And then there‚Äôs one I call Samson because he‚Äôs supposed to use rebar to tie people up. Or Wrath, the one who was supposedly hunting cartels and gangs out west.‚Äù



Melody suddenly seemed uncomfortable. ‚ÄúDo you really think these guys exist Barnabas? I mean it seems pretty unbelievable.‚Äù



‚ÄúYeah I know‚Ä¶‚Äù I relented. ‚ÄúStill a part of me wishes that they were more than stories online.‚Äù



She looked over my shoulder and her face fell. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm going to have to go. I need to get my boat over to a different pier this afternoon.‚Äù¬†



‚ÄúOh,‚Äù I said, suddenly wishing that she didn‚Äôt have to leave. ‚ÄúI would offer to help, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much I‚Äôd be able to do.‚Äù



‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think I can handle myself.‚Äù Her eyes sparkled. ‚ÄúI just heard about a new bookstore down in Portland. Would you be interested in going sometime? It‚Äôd be better with a friend along.‚Äù



I nodded and her perfect teeth flashed in a bright smile.¬†



‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said, scribbling something down on a napkin. ‚ÄúI know you don‚Äôt have your phone, so here‚Äôs my cell number. Shoot me a text and I‚Äôll let you know when I‚Äôm going down there again.‚Äù She got up and walked away, throwing one last glance over her shoulder. ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôll do the driving, just in case you‚Äôre up all night editing again.‚Äù



And then she was gone.

During our conversation, he asked about my strengths, which really made me reflect on how I want to develop my skills and shape my career in compliance.
Honestly, that meeting made me even more motivated to work at his firm, but I didn‚Äôt mention anything directly because I didn‚Äôt want to come across as too forward in asking for a job.

Now I‚Äôm wondering: Should I reach out again just to share how much our conversation‚Äîand his question about my strengths‚Äîimpacted me?

1mgo6y5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgo6y5,"First impressions on 35 fragrances, including Francesca Bianchi, Amouage, Creed, Tom Ford, Kerosene, Les Ind√©modables, Scents of Wood and more","This is gonna be my last first impressions post that includes a few dozen fragrances, at least for a long time. I will still be purchasing samples but in much smaller quantities, so subsequent posts might not even break into 10 samples per post.

**Francesca Bianchi**

‚Ä¢ *Angel's Dust* - Powdery iris and mimosa. Musky and with a bit of rose. Totally feminine, and to be completely honest it makes me think of an old woman, but not in a bad way. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Encounters* - Can't r…õally describe what it smells like in the air but I like it a lot. Up close it's very ambery and woody with slight citrus and floral undertones. Pretty nice and I'm liking it a lot as it dries. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Etruscan Water* - A herbal oakmoss bomb with heavy musks and a touch of citruses. I kind of see this like a dirty Neroli Portofino. It starts smelling much softer and the citruses and florals stand out more as it dries. This one was surprising. 8.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Lost in Heaven* - Clean, sweet, slightly honeyed smell in the air. The beeswax is very prominent up close, some white florals. This isn't as animalic or resinous as the notes would make it seem but those notes will probably come out on skin. Despite the scent being mostly white florals and beeswax I think this is perfectly unisex. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Luxe Calme Volupte* - Fruity iris. That's about it. 6/10

‚Ä¢ *Sex and the Sea* - Pineapple and coconut with some florals. At least on paper I don't smell anything animalic here. I don't love the pineapple and coconut combo to be honest. 6/10

‚Ä¢ *Sex and the Sea Neroli* - I like this much more, the neroli and coconut here do make me think of the beach. It's a bit sunscreeney but in a good way. I also can't smell any animalics here. 7.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Sticky Fingers* - Gorgeous patchouli and tobacco scent, slightly animalic. Smells amazing in the air, the small tinge of cinnamon is intoxicating. Very excited to try this one out more. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *The Black Knight* - Honey and light smoke in the air. The leather is very faint on paper, which is something that has happened with all other fragrances with a leather note. The most prominent notes up close are the orris and honey, which, along with the little leather coming through, smell r…õally good. Looking forward to trying this out more. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *The Dark Side* - Opens smelling herbal, which is odd considering the notes. The scent is reminding me of a tea or medicine I had as a kid that I disliked a lot, so not sure how to feel about this one. 4/10

‚Ä¢ *The Lover's Tale* - Soft, floral and soapy over a smokey leather just like The Black Knight, which is, once again, faint on paper. I like the honey notes in these fragrances. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Tyger Tyger* - White floral forward scent, but I like how it's done. The florals, peach and honey are blended very nicely. Leans slightly feminine. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *Under My Skin* - Ambery, powdery and ever so slightly aromatic florals and woods. I like this one a lot, I'm looking forward to trying it out more. 9/10

I'm glad I didn't pass up on this set when I found it on fragswap, I'm very surprised by the quality and creativity of these fragrances. What surprises me the most about Bianchi's work is how natural all of them smell. I don't know if my nose is broken or if I made it very sensitive to some synthetic aroma chemicals, but I've started smelling a specific sharpness in many fragrances similar to the smell of fresh paint or the ink in a newspaper, and I don't get it at all with any of her fragrances. I can totally see myself owning at least one or two of her fragrances, I'm looking forward to giving a wear to several of them.

**Amouage**

‚Ä¢ *Opus V Woods Symphony* - Extremely well blended rose and iris with woods and a very slight booziness. No funkiness to the oud here. This is one of the best iris scents I've tried. Completely unisex but I can see why some might find it feminine. It starts smelling soapy as it dries. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Opus VII Reckless Leather* - Reminds me a lot of Penhaligon's Lord George in the air. Smells green, a bit floral and spicy up close, but in an almost foug√®re-like way, but there's a note here that's bothering me because it smells a lot like cumin, might be the fenugreek. It doesn't particularly smell like leather, though. 7/10

‚Ä¢ *Opus XII Rose Incense* - Bright and jammy rose in the air √† la Oud Satin Mood. Up close this is an excellently blended resinous and vanillic rose scent. Unlike other Amouage scents like Purpose 50 the olibanum is more subdued and blended amazingly well with the rest of the notes instead of standing out on its own, which I like a lot. This is an excellent rose fragrance. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Opus XIII Silver Oud* - Animalic oud in the air. Exactly the same oud found in King Blue but here it's basically all there is to the fragrance, whereas in King Blue there's also a noticeable fruitiness and patchouli restraining it. This is a bit unpalatable but I've heard the dry down is much better. 5/10

‚Ä¢ *Opus XIV Royal Tobacco* - Interesting scent. It's resinous and vanillic, doesn't r…õally smell like tobacco to me though. There's a balsamic note here that smells a bit like maple syrup. I like this a lot, even though I'm having a hard time making out what this smells like. 9/10

For the most part I liked the Library Collection overall and I'm excited to continue trying out Amouage's offerings. I'll be buying the Men's Extraits set soon to try out Jubilation 40, Reflection 45 and Interlude 53, as well as the new Opus XVI Timber as Amouage is including a complimentary sample with all orders on their website. I have also yet to receive the 10 piece Odyssey Collection set I bought from Jomashop and I'd also like to buy the Men's 12 piece sampler down the line.

**Creed Delphinus** - Creamy and slightly powdery vanilla and almond in the air. At first the orris smelled like a syrupy cherry for some reason, but it started smelling how it should after a short while. Mostly orris/iris, vanilla and almonds. Slightly feminine in my opinion and I'm not a huge fan of this one, but I like it way more than Centaurus off first impressions. 6/10

There's still plenty of Creed fragrances I'd like to try, such as Tabarome, Royal Water, Erolfa, Neroli Sauvage, etc. but there are no official samples to any of these so I'll have to start buying decants. I also bought samples for the new Oud Zarian, and I'm r…õally looking forward to trying that one out as rose ouds are one of my favorite scent profiles.

**Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 EDP** - All I get in the air is the same, almost offensively strong musky scent I get from Clive Christian's Town & Country (supposedly ambrocenide, not sure). Up close I can barely smell it, but I can smell the same musk softened with some florals. I heard you can go nose blind to Baccarat but I didn't think it would be so quick. I'll have to test on skin but as it stands this is unconscionably overrated. 4/10

**Penhaligon's Eau The Audacity** - A middle ground between Babycat (more on this one later) and Eau d'Ombr√© Leather. It has a similar airy and clean vibe like Babycat but with a slightly synthetic leather note like the Tom Ford. The frankincense is nowhere near as well blended as in Babycat, so it kind of is like a worse version of the YSL. Not a bad fragrance by any means but it's far from my favorite from Penhaligon's. 8/10

**Dior Homme Parfum (2025)** - Buttery iris with some amber. I usually don't like buttery iris (like the one in Givenchy's Gentleman EDP and Reserve Priv√©e) but it's done to my taste here so I don't mind it that much. Smells clean, makes me think of washed laundry despite not being soapy at all, you can tell Francis Kurkdjian made this. A strong vetiver starts appearing after a while. Not bad at all but I much prefer DH Intense. Absolutely adore the dabber, the cap is screw on and the little black stem that replicates the straw in the big sized bottle makes it super easy to apply. 7/10

**Yves Saint Laurent**

‚Ä¢ *Babycat* - Reminds me of Eau d'Ombr√© Leather but it's much better overall. The vanilla is lighter and airier, and the suede note is far smoother and more natural than the leather note in the Tom Ford. The olibanum note is blended perfectly and adds a slight resinous feel to the scent. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Tuxedo* - Immediately smelled like patchouli in the air. Up close I can smell more vanilla, the rose and a touch of violet leaf. Smells pretty formal, this is definitely not a fragrance for casual wear. It also reminds me of Penhaligon's Cairo in how both remind me of black olives in the opening. 9/10

**Louis Vuitton**

‚Ä¢ *Sun Song (2025)* - Loads of neroli with a bit of citruses and musks, this is extremely close to smelling like tortillas with how much neroli it has. I think I'd need to be on vacation at the beach to r…õally appreciate this scent profile. 7/10

‚Ä¢ *Afternoon Swim* - Very photor…õalistic juicy orange scent with ginger and a slight muskiness. Amazing freshie and one of the best Louis Vuitton I've tried outside the oud line. I've heard performance is poor but I'm not too surprised considering the type of scent that it is. 9/10

‚Ä¢ *Symphony* - Extremely bright grapefruit and ginger scent. I've had Montagne's Harmony for a few months and I couldn't tell you a difference between the two, I'll have to make a side by side comparison. Awesome grapefruit scent but I prefer other fragrances like Tygar and The Hedonist Extrait. 8.5/10

**Scents of Wood Plum in Cognac** - Great boozy plum scent, the name is pretty much what you get. Up close there's some cinnamon, vanilla and immortelle's odd maple syrupy herbalness. Pretty nice, I might buy an official 10 ml. 8/10

**Les Ind√©modables Vanille Havane** - Tobacco, cacao, vanilla, a bit of booze and dried fruits. The note breakdown in Fragrantica is exactly what you get. The sillage smells absolutely fantastic. This reminds me a bit of Tobacco Vanille, but I think it's a bit better since it doesn't have the overpowering spices the Tom Ford has in the opening. Could be a worthy cold weather signature scent. 9.5/10

**Kilian Smoking Hot** - Maple syrupy apple scent. It reminds me a lot of Clive Christian's E Gourmand Oriental with how thick and r…õalistic the maple syrup scent is, and if it's anything like that one I probably won't like this one much. It's also not smokey at all. I'll have to try this on skin. 6/10

**Korbaj Toxic Desire** - I was gifted a 1 ml decant of this by the person I bought the Smoking Hot decant and the Delphinus sample and this is an okay clone of Angels' Share. It doesn't seem to do anything with the scent profile other than adding some citruses in the opening that feel misplaced but fade quickly. I'm over Angels' Share's DNA so I don't care much about this. 7/10

**Tom Ford**

‚Ä¢ *Bois Marocain* - Feels like a prototype/precursor of both Bois Pacifique and √âb√®ne Fum√©. It shares similarities with both but it's neither here nor there, it's a nice fruity, woody scent but not much more than that. It's starting to become smokier as it dries. The citruses in the early opening give me Creed Himalaya vibes for some reason. 7.5/10

‚Ä¢ *Soleil Neige* - This is pretty nice. The white flowers and rose are soft and gentle and are blended very nicely with the benzoin and vanilla from the base. The name is kind of fitting, I can kind of imagine sunlit snow when I smell this. Might be slightly feminine but not too much. I can see why people like this so much now. 8.5/10

I was also supposed to receive samples for Soleil de Feu and Bitter Peach, but my parcel forwarder has been unacceptably slow as of late so I'm still waiting for these. If I receive them this week I'll add my first impressions as a comment under this post.

**Kerosene**

‚Ä¢ *Follow* - Smells just like a coffee hard candy that's sold here in Mexico. Extremely r…õalistic caramelized coffee scent with a slight burned tinge. Pretty interesting. 8/10

‚Ä¢ *R'oud Elements* - The orange and woodiness blend together much better than I expected. Doesn't r…õally smell like oud to me though, but I don't mind too much. There's also a slight resinous touch and aromatics under the woods and orange, definitely from the listed amber and lavender notes. I like this a lot. 9/10",4,1754240047.0,Colognes,1,1.0,False
1mgo6m0,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1mgo6m0/my_first_colonic_experience_after_trying/,My first colonic experience after trying everything for OIC from Methadone. Warning Poop talk,"I wanted to post this in hopes that it will help people who could also be suffering from OIC (opiate induced constipation) or extreme constipation. Opiate induced constipation is a lot different from regular constipation because most people who suffer from OIC or medication induced constipation almost never go to the bathroom (number 2).  I have been on Methadone for a year and I think that was the last time I went a normal number 2. Now I‚Äôm lucky if I can squeeze out a couple Milk Dud size rocks every morning. It is very sad and depressing when you can‚Äôt poop and you want to so bad. Everything becomes uncomfortable; eating, walking, love making, laying down, sitting up, everything! 

I tried a lot of things. The one thing that worked ok was sennakot but it would often make me vomit. So I scheduled a colonic and the nice lady was able to get me in right away. I scheduled it Thursday night and I received a text that they had an opening that Saturday at 9am. I said I‚Äôm there! 

The morning of I had a little coffee but no food. I arrived at the place and was greeted by a lovely lady named Olga. I learned that I would be having an open colonic where a small hose thin tube is inserted for the water. I didn‚Äôt want to insert it too far or not far enough so I asked the lady if she could do it. She said no problem. 

She got me set up and going with the machine pretty quickly. Once the machine started she began to explain everything to me about the process and holding in the water and then eliminating it. I was nervous and I started getting nauseous about 15 min in. I threw up a few times but not a lot of throw up. She explained that the nausea is from the toxin release. She said patients that have a lot of build up like I did usually get nausea the first time. I was ok with that because I was at a point of desperation. 

Olga was extremely nice, helpful, comforting.  She even threw my T-shirt in the wash after I threw up on myself. I was on the machine for about 40 minutes before anything started coming out. Then the last 5 mins I started having the waste come out. We had to stop because my session was only for 45 minutes.  She explained that the first session will soften the hard impacted feces and the second session will be more successful with a release of more waste. 

When I came home from the open colonic session I felt tired and she said that is normal. I told a nap and woke up hungry. She said nothing raw the first day after and she also recommended I drink a glass of warm lemon water every morning before anything. So today is Sunday and I go back tomorrow for the second session. I hope this thread helps anyone who is on the fence about having a colonic. To me it‚Äôs worth it even with the side effects I had. Be blessed! ",1,1754240025.0,xxketo,1,0.56,False

Scored 96.3% in 9th even when i had a ton of Olympiads to give, including IESO national level, along with jso, nmtc, ioqm, vvm, SOFs, silverzone and shit ton more where i performed well and scored medals.  
this has nothing to do with the situation but u can understand the situation well with this.  
Recently i did not submit my math's register work as homework given to us and so the teacher wrote us all who had not done the work, a diary note (communication method with parents by writing a complaint of not completing the work), many of the children had not done it. i couldn't do the work as I'm regularly engaged in such activities (like Olympiads) which i consider more important than a few questions of register work.  
long back in summer break i created a solution of dil. hcl, H20, acetone( had pink hue) and a lil perfume to clean my table having marker and coffee stains. The solution fking fell on my sheets and my DIARY. due to this some pages got torn as they became too thin and earlier diary notes's ink faded and left the bluish-purplish ball pen ink stains all over the diary and it got ruined along with a very strong perfume smell embedded into the pages. I tried to dry and remove the smell as much as i could.

fast forward and even a few teachers good to me didn't have any problem and they just signed on the pages where the stains were not present, BUT this fking math teacher of mine could have just signed the diary but now she's furious with this even when i begged to her and explained the situation about what had happened, but being the biased/partial she is towards me, she once alleged me of not submitting my register before summer break even when i had and when i showed her the signed register, she started making excuses, now ,she is calling my parents to school tomorrow and i see this as such a silly reason+they could have just replaced my diary with a new one or i could have used the same one.

My parents are not supporting me, and i already know by the conversation we had in the school that the teacher is gonna blame that i tried to forge fake documents and remove the diary notes with the solution as if it was a crime record and I'm that dumb to mess with such delicate paper, thinking pen marks could have been removed.  
there are much worse scenes happening in school with a boy of my class sexually harassing a girl, the weak guys getting bullied, and ""cool kids"" bunking/creating scenes, children bringing vapes and alcohol to school AND the list goes on and on. In all these cases none have been seriously punished.

She is very partial towards me and as if likes to annoy me, while her own daughter in my class cant score more than 40 marks in maths and gets a pardon for not submitting. She is not even slightly good at her profession and she like to speedrun (syllabus bhagana) the syllabus without making the children understand or take doubts(finished whole quadratic chapter two)- 30 min periods

and they have to punish an above average studious guy who accidently stained his diary  
Ironically, i yesterday won interschool icse regional quiz competition for the school.

if smth happens tomorrow i will vent out all my anger on academic performance

Please, DON'T ASK for free readings. Readings take a lot of energy and I'm human. I take time to prepare myself for the readings. It's not good and it's not respectful to ask for a free service as this cost a lot of my energy. I have limits and boundaries and I cannot do many readings in one day.

Sorry for classical exemples but it's quite complicated to find activities other than War and Slaneesh's decadence.

Use your imagination to convert this for our sweet Primarchs.

* Chill date : simple activity, almost trivial but the romanticism makes it special (a walk, a coffee, a movie at the cinema...)
* Fancy date : some fun in a place made for the occasion (going to amusement park, a casino, a bar or a nightclub,...)
* Expensive date : spend as much money possible on the finest activities (an upscale restaurant, watching a performance at opera or arena, going shopping...)
* Outdoor date : enjoy healthy natural air before the Mechanicus comes here (a beach trip, a hike, going camping in a feral world, ...)
* Home date : have a romantic moment without moving (a movie in a bedroom, a romantic dinner made by the couple or a servitor, playing a game alone together, ...)
* Unexpected date : something so crazy and/or specific than it's quite impossible to predict (quality time in a unknown place except from you, an extreme/almost mortal activity, ...)

It doesn‚Äôt begin with that night of indiscretion and betrayal in a hotel. There were a thousand small lies and betrayals that preceded that sin.¬†

Is it more wicked, more consequential, to lie to your wife or to lie to yourself? I don‚Äôt know. The distinction seems to me to be meaningless. They both involve a deceit and they both culminate in a worldview that doesn‚Äôt align with the facts of the universe. They both make a liar of you, and they both break your contract with reality.¬†

In any case, I lied to myself and I lied to Danielle to the degree that the person I truly was and the person I played on stage had been completely severed from one another, at some point. I did the things a husband does. I cared for the physical needs of my family. I did not raise my voice nor my hand. I brought home a salary that paid the mortgage. I went on dinner dates and cleaned up after myself and bought birthday gifts. But that wasn‚Äôt really me.¬†

When I returned to West Virginia from Baltimore that second time, the song of the carriage lecher had already washed over my ego to the point that I‚Äôd been released from the illusion of Heath Bledsoe. I could scarcely play that role on the stage. The mask had cracked and my merry band was rising to a crescendo, letting me know with its twisted tongue that my trite little human experience had run its course.¬†

Maria and I scarcely spoke on the drive. Or if we did, I don‚Äôt recall any of the conversation. She withdrew, somewhat, and the cabin of her Cadillac was not filled with the laughter and lechery it had been. She dropped me off at the office parking lot and I drove straight home.

The lute and the woodwind faded, for a time, content to wait in the background for my next mistake. I retook center stage.

In my cowardice, I still did not confess to Dani. She asked me about my investor meeting. I told her very little, because I did not care to. I asked her about Jericho, and she told me every detail of his day and the schedule of his bottles and naps and of each moan and cry. Her care was genuine, no matter how mundane it might have seemed.¬†

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs Maria?‚Äù she asked, and I could see it then, in her eyes. The doubt which she didn‚Äôt want to voice.¬†

Hollow, I shrugged. ‚ÄúHappy about getting the cash injections. I talked to her about a raise as soon as we can start bringing in real revenue.‚Äù

Danielle nodded, but her furrowed brow did not subside. She examined my eyes, the bags beneath them, the redness of my flushed cheeks and the greasiness of my unkempt hair.¬†

‚ÄúYou goin‚Äô with me to take Jericho to his four-month checkup?‚Äù she asked.¬†

I had forgotten about that. ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let Maria know I can‚Äôt come in this afternoon.‚Äù

Dani needed to catch up on sleep. I did too, after my own sleepless night, but I had no excuse. I sat in the living room with Jericho and arranged the handful of baby toys and noisemakers we had nearby around his playmat. It was tummy time, Danielle had reminded me, and infants his age needed to practice rolling around and grasping onto whatever they could reach.

For a few minutes, I sat beside him and worked mindlessly on my laptop to the sound of repeating songs about ABCs and monkeys at the zoo and firefighters in their big, red trucks. Jericho rolled around and giggled, mesmerized by flashing lights and clunky animatronics.¬†

It took a moment to set in, but I realized that I was present. Conscious, in the moment. The musical baby toys were ringing in my ears, but no mad melodies of a lute. A tear came into my eye against my will, and I stroked Jericho‚Äôs downy soft hair.¬†

He groped for a nearby rattle, and I handed it to him. That little fist wrapped around the grip of the toy and my son babbled happily. He smiled, as he had the very first time, and I smiled back. I opened my mouth to sing an old song that my mother had sung to me. My first memory.

‚ÄúYou are my sunshine, my only sunshine,‚Äù I began quietly. ‚ÄúYou make me happy, when skies are gray‚Ä¶‚Äù My voice cracked and I was afraid I might begin to bawl. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never know, dear‚Äì‚Äù

Jericho began shaking his rattle, but not with the random clumsy motion of a newborn.¬†

*Tikka‚Ä¶ Tikka‚Ä¶ Tikka‚Ä¶* The movements were decisive, direct.¬†

I went silent.¬†

*TIKKA tikka tikka tikka. TIKKA tikka tikka tikka.*

My mouth gaped, and so did Jericho‚Äôs. Both of us could only stare at one another in horror.

The lute and the woodwind returned.

\*\*

I told Danielle.

I made her a pot of coffee, one last time. I rocked Jericho down for a nap and tidied up the house. Over the song of the Carriage Lecher, pounding in my crooked head, I made whatever preparations I could think to do beforehand. I packed a bag, in case that was how it was going to play out. I packed a bag for Danielle and Jericho, in case it ended that way.

When she woke up, I brought her the coffee and sat down beside her on the bed. I set down the baby monitor and watched for any unexpected red flashes out of the corner of my eye.¬†

She could tell I was distraught, and I think she already knew why. Tears welled up in her eyes.¬†

‚ÄúI have to tell you something, Dani,‚Äù I started. I could scarcely hear myself speak over the rattling of chains, the eager wheezing of my three-legged companion.

She shook her head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare, Heath.‚Äù She kept shaking her head, groaning under her breath. She had guessed.

I kept on. ‚ÄúDani, I‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù she yelled, and she pulled her blanket up to her neck.¬†

‚ÄúI had sex with Maria,‚Äù I said, knowing those words had to come out. Did they have to come out so indelicately? It didn‚Äôt matter, I told myself, despite my suspicion that Dani would be replaying that moment in her head for months or years to come.

Dani punched me, square in the cheek. I soaked up the hit, barely reeling, and I tasted my own blood welling on my gums. ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù She buried her head in her pillow.¬†

I sat there and stared at the afternoon light trickling through our busted venetian blinds. There was a stinging in the air and a slight lulling of the Lecher‚Äôs merry score. Just the blood in my mouth and my wife‚Äôs sobs.

‚ÄúGo to hell, you bastard,‚Äù she whimpered.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave, if you want me to,‚Äù I said.

Her head jerked up and I saw those sweet green eyes roiling with animosity. ‚ÄúYou already packed for that, ain‚Äôt you,‚Äù she said. It wasn‚Äôt a question. I said nothing to that. Of course she was right. ‚ÄúTo go run off with your whore.‚Äù

I could no longer hear the song. Only the sound of my unfortunately still-beating heart.

‚ÄúI packed things for you and Jericho too, if you‚Äôd rather stay with your mom,‚Äù I finally replied.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying right the fuck in this goddamned place,‚Äù Danielle told me, pointing and gesturing wildly at the house. I didn‚Äôt argue. ‚ÄúHow dare you,‚Äù she said. She repeated herself. ‚ÄúHow dare you. How dare you. How dare you.‚Äù The whimpers were themselves a replacement for the music.

\*\*

There would be no redemption, no act of sacrifice that could end my story on a bittersweet or even an instructive note. Nothing I could do would wash away the consequences of lives destroyed. There could be no self flagellation that would undo my failures. I would not leave, as my own father had, but nor could I stay. What kind of lecher brings debauchery into the home of his child and that child‚Äôs mother?

I contemplated ending my life, went through the research of how I could feasibly get away with cashing out a life insurance policy. At least I could leave Jericho and Danielle with some small consolation from the destruction I had wrought. I understood why my great-grandfather had done just that when he had lost his leg and his ability to provide for his children with a miner‚Äôs pay.¬†

And I remembered how that act of well-intended sacrifice had torn apart an entire lineage. How it led to killing off what was left of his family, through addiction and imitation of the suicide of the patriarch, until teenage Heath Bledsoe was the only living memory of a once sprawling bloodline. My mother‚Äôs heroin overdose was a decade‚Äôs long echo of that same stone that crushed Jeremy Bledsoe‚Äôs femur. Perhaps, so were my own grievous mistakes.¬†

Ultimately, I concluded that such an end would be the easy way out, for me.¬†

The church (or my church, anyway) will tell you that the best thing to do is reconcile, forgive, regain trust, move on. But Danielle could not do any of those things, and I could not countenance the idea of even allowing her to try. What is broken cannot always be repaired.

There was only one thing I knew: I could not allow my son or his mother to feel the chains that bound me to that accursed carriage or its legion of skanks and vagabonds and ne‚Äôer-do-wells.¬†

That night, I spoke to Him. I asked Him what He wanted and how I could save my son.

I saw a vision before me, although vision may not be the right description. It was more that I felt the impression of a remote place, but also not so remote. A long, winding cobblestone road. There were steep, ancient cliff faces on all sides and no way to tell where the path wound its way through the labyrinth. No way to tell who built the road, or why, or when.¬†

My hooves were slick with mud and my mouth still tasted the blood from Danielle‚Äôs strike.

The strumming of a familiar lute‚Ä¶ the whistling of an unfamiliar woodwind, a timbre whose origin I could never know.¬†

I pulled the weight of many souls in the Lecher‚Äôs minstrel carriage. They writhed in agony and wiled away their timelessness with drug and drink and vicious, joyless copulating atop sweat-stained velvet upholstery.

I limped along, ever along. *Clop-clop. Clop-clop. Clop-clop.* A hide-wrapped ribcage, dangling by a knot of hair, rattled and bumped against my chest. Its wretched zills jingled their percussive jingles along with the eternal procession. *Tikka. Tikka. Tikka.*

*Bring me others, then*, said the lute. *More for our merry retinue*.

Others? How, I wondered?

But I knew how. I had already sunken into depravity and dragged others to follow their worst impulses before, and it wasn‚Äôt so difficult to tempt and prod.

Could I really do that? Could I condemn other innocent souls to save those of my family?

Of course I could.¬†

What I cannot do is leave you with some final warning. There is no didactic message, and this is not a cautionary tale. You have your own part to play. You have your own face behind the mask. If you hear the song of the Carriage Lecher, you have heard it before.

1mgo1d3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewTheRoom/comments/1mgo1d3/does_the_zojirushi_ecytc100xb_coffee_maker_live/,Does the Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB Coffee Maker Live Up to Its Hype?,"Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB is a coffee maker I‚Äôve recently had the chance to test, and as someone who thrives on a morning caffeine kick, I couldn‚Äôt wait to dive into its features. This machine positions itself as a contender among premium drip coffee makers, touting a thermal carafe, programmable settings, and a special iced coffee brewing option. After brewing countless cups and even experimenting with iced coffee, here‚Äôs my genuine take on how it fared in my caffeine-fueled routine.

**Elegant and Practical Design**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the sleek combo of stainless steel and black accents. It‚Äôs subtly modern but doesn‚Äôt scream for attention on the countertop. With dimensions of 8""D x 10.63""W x 14.88""H, it fit snugly in my kitchen, even with limited counter space. The removable water tank? A blessing! It‚Äôs fully washable and made filling a stress-free process (goodbye awkward sink maneuvers). The controls are button-operated, giving the machine a straightforward manual vibe that doesn‚Äôt overwhelm, even for non-techy users in the house like my partner.

**Programmable Options That Make Life Easier**  
Being programmable is a significant win for this coffee maker. I‚Äôd set the timer at night to wake up to the aroma of fresh coffee‚Äîa feature that genuinely made mornings more bearable. If you‚Äôre in a rush, the time-saving mode brews hot coffee faster, which was perfect on those chaotic mornings when my toddler decided to redecorate the living room with cereal. Whether you love having control over the brewing process or want a set-it-and-forget-it option, this machine offers a good mix of both.

**Check Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB price on Amazon.**

**The Thermal Carafe is a Game-Changer**  
One of the standout features here is the vacuum-insulated stainless steel carafe. This kept my coffee piping hot for hours, which was a lifesaver when I had back-to-back Zoom meetings. Unlike glass carafes that sit on a warmer and risk overcooking the brew, this one preserved the flavor. Plus, the smooth, thumb-activated pouring design meant no awkward spills. Though the carafe performed like a champ, it does have a slightly narrow spout that makes cleaning a tad challenging unless you have a bottle brush handy.

**Brewing Performance: Hot and Cold**  
The Zojirushi EC-YTC100XB brews at a high temperature of 200¬∞F, allowing the full extraction of coffee flavors. I loved how rich and robust the hot coffee tasted‚Äîdefinitely caf√©-quality. Curious about the iced coffee feature, I tried it out by following the coffee-to-water ratio for a stronger brew (to counter dilution from the ice). The result? A cold coffee elixir that didn‚Äôt taste watered down‚Äînot exactly a Starbucks rival but definitely close. The machine brews up to 10 cups of hot coffee or 5 cups of iced coffee, so it can easily cater to a small gathering or a thirsty household.

**Reusable Coffee Filter and Eco-Friendly Perk**  
Another thing I found impressive was the permanent stainless steel mesh filter. Not only is it reusable and reduces paper waste, but it‚Äôs also easy to clean. I won‚Äôt lie; I forgot to rinse it once, and the buildup was annoying to scrub off the next day. But that‚Äôs on me and not the product! If you‚Äôre not inclined to use this filter, it‚Äôs versatile enough to accommodate paper ones as well.

**Pluses**  
- Keeps coffee hot for hours with the vacuum-insulated carafe.  
- Offers a programmable timer and time-saving mode for convenience.  
- Removable water tank simplifies cleaning and refills.  
- Supports both hot and iced coffee brewing with optimal flavor extraction.

**Negative Attributes**  
- The narrow spout of the carafe is tricky to clean thoroughly.  
- The brushed stainless steel finish, while elegant, smudges easily.  
- Slightly bulky for smaller kitchens or those with limited counter space.

**Competing Brands**  
While there‚Äôs plenty to rave about, I found it essential to compare it to alternatives like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or the Technivorm Moccamaster. The Cuisinart offers a larger brewing capacity (14 cups) and is slightly more affordable, which is a plus for families. However, its conventional glass carafe doesn‚Äôt hold a candle to Zojirushi‚Äôs thermal carafe in keeping coffee consistently hot. On the premium side, the Technivorm Moccamaster produces exceptional brews even faster than this, but at almost double the price, it‚Äôs less wallet-friendly. Here, Zojirushi strikes a comfortable middle ground, blending robust functionality and affordability.

**Money‚Äôs Worth**  
Is this coffee maker worth the investment? For anyone who values delicious, consistently hot coffee and appreciates thoughtful features like the iced coffee option and insulated carafe, this machine delivers solid value. It bridges the gap between affordability and high-end coffee makers, even though it comes with minor quirks that could be overlooked given its overall performance. That said, bargain hunters might find more competitively priced options with fewer premium features.

The lute and the woodwind returned.

\*\*

I told Danielle.

I made her a pot of coffee, one last time. I rocked Jericho down for a nap and tidied up the house. Over the song of the Carriage Lecher, pounding in my crooked head, I made whatever preparations I could think to do beforehand. I packed a bag, in case that was how it was going to play out. I packed a bag for Danielle and Jericho, in case it ended that way.

When she woke up, I brought her the coffee and sat down beside her on the bed. I set down the baby monitor and watched for any unexpected red flashes out of the corner of my eye.¬†

She could tell I was distraught, and I think she already knew why. Tears welled up in her eyes.¬†

‚ÄúI have to tell you something, Dani,‚Äù I started. I could scarcely hear myself speak over the rattling of chains, the eager wheezing of my three-legged companion.

She shook her head. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare, Heath.‚Äù She kept shaking her head, groaning under her breath. She had guessed.

I kept on. ‚ÄúDani, I‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù she yelled, and she pulled her blanket up to her neck.¬†

‚ÄúI had sex with Maria,‚Äù I said, knowing those words had to come out. Did they have to come out so indelicately? It didn‚Äôt matter, I told myself, despite my suspicion that Dani would be replaying that moment in her head for months or years to come.

Dani punched me, square in the cheek. I soaked up the hit, barely reeling, and I tasted my own blood welling on my gums. ‚ÄúFuck you!‚Äù She buried her head in her pillow.¬†

I sat there and stared at the afternoon light trickling through our busted venetian blinds. There was a stinging in the air and a slight lulling of the Lecher‚Äôs merry score. Just the blood in my mouth and my wife‚Äôs sobs.

‚ÄúGo to hell, you bastard,‚Äù she whimpered.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll leave, if you want me to,‚Äù I said.

Her head jerked up and I saw those sweet green eyes roiling with animosity. ‚ÄúYou already packed for that, ain‚Äôt you,‚Äù she said. It wasn‚Äôt a question. I said nothing to that. Of course she was right. ‚ÄúTo go run off with your whore.‚Äù

I could no longer hear the song. Only the sound of my unfortunately still-beating heart.

‚ÄúI packed things for you and Jericho too, if you‚Äôd rather stay with your mom,‚Äù I finally replied.¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre staying right the fuck in this goddamned place,‚Äù Danielle told me, pointing and gesturing wildly at the house. I didn‚Äôt argue. ‚ÄúHow dare you,‚Äù she said. She repeated herself. ‚ÄúHow dare you. How dare you. How dare you.‚Äù The whimpers were themselves a replacement for the music.

\*\*

There would be no redemption, no act of sacrifice that could end my story on a bittersweet or even an instructive note. Nothing I could do would wash away the consequences of lives destroyed. There could be no self flagellation that would undo my failures. I would not leave, as my own father had, but nor could I stay. What kind of lecher brings debauchery into the home of his child and that child‚Äôs mother?

I contemplated ending my life, went through the research of how I could feasibly get away with cashing out a life insurance policy. At least I could leave Jericho and Danielle with some small consolation from the destruction I had wrought. I understood why my great-grandfather had done just that when he had lost his leg and his ability to provide for his children with a miner‚Äôs pay.¬†

And I remembered how that act of well-intended sacrifice had torn apart an entire lineage. How it led to killing off what was left of his family, through addiction and imitation of the suicide of the patriarch, until teenage Heath Bledsoe was the only living memory of a once sprawling bloodline. My mother‚Äôs heroin overdose was a decade‚Äôs long echo of that same stone that crushed Jeremy Bledsoe‚Äôs femur. Perhaps, so were my own grievous mistakes.¬†

Ultimately, I concluded that such an end would be the easy way out, for me.¬†

The church (or my church, anyway) will tell you that the best thing to do is reconcile, forgive, regain trust, move on. But Danielle could not do any of those things, and I could not countenance the idea of even allowing her to try. What is broken cannot always be repaired.

There was only one thing I knew: I could not allow my son or his mother to feel the chains that bound me to that accursed carriage or its legion of skanks and vagabonds and ne‚Äôer-do-wells.¬†

That night, I spoke to Him. I asked Him what He wanted and how I could save my son.

I saw a vision before me, although vision may not be the right description. It was more that I felt the impression of a remote place, but also not so remote. A long, winding cobblestone road. There were steep, ancient cliff faces on all sides and no way to tell where the path wound its way through the labyrinth. No way to tell who built the road, or why, or when.¬†

My hooves were slick with mud and my mouth still tasted the blood from Danielle‚Äôs strike.

The strumming of a familiar lute‚Ä¶ the whistling of an unfamiliar woodwind, a timbre whose origin I could never know.¬†

I pulled the weight of many souls in the Lecher‚Äôs minstrel carriage. They writhed in agony and wiled away their timelessness with drug and drink and vicious, joyless copulating atop sweat-stained velvet upholstery.

I limped along, ever along. *Clop-clop. Clop-clop. Clop-clop.* A hide-wrapped ribcage, dangling by a knot of hair, rattled and bumped against my chest. Its wretched zills jingled their percussive jingles along with the eternal procession. *Tikka. Tikka. Tikka.*

*Bring me others, then*, said the lute. *More for our merry retinue*.

Others? How, I wondered?

But I knew how. I had already sunken into depravity and dragged others to follow their worst impulses before, and it wasn‚Äôt so difficult to tempt and prod.

Could I really do that? Could I condemn other innocent souls to save those of my family?

Of course I could.¬†

What I cannot do is leave you with some final warning. There is no didactic message, and this is not a cautionary tale. You have your own part to play. You have your own face behind the mask. If you hear the song of the Carriage Lecher, you have heard it before.

1mgnxin,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplianceCheck/comments/1mgnxin/explore_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker_by_le/,Explore the best French press coffee maker by Le Creuset,"Making coffee with the Le Creuset 70706200170171 French Press almost feels like a morning ritual of pure indulgence. This product immediately impressed me with its vibrant Caribbean color and hefty stoneware design. I‚Äôve always preferred French presses for their simplicity, and this one takes it up a notch with its premium construction and elegant aesthetic. Whether on the counter or perched next to a croissant on the breakfast table, it just looks stunning. However, style alone doesn‚Äôt brew the perfect cup of coffee, so I put it through its paces‚Äîand let me tell you, it excelled in many areas but had a couple of noticeable quirks.

**Design That Stands Out**

The moment I unpacked this French press, I couldn‚Äôt help but admire its aesthetic appeal. The Caribbean blue glaze adds a pop of color that‚Äôs vibrant and timeless. Crafted from premium stoneware, it exudes quality and durability right out of the box. Its 34-ounce capacity is just the right size for a small family or solo coffee fanatics who enjoy a second cup without brewing again. The nonporous, non-reactive finish is a feature I found especially great because it doesn‚Äôt retain odors or stains from previous brews. I‚Äôm clumsy at times, and the resistance to chips and cracks promised by the material gave me peace of mind. However, this heavy-duty build makes the French press slightly weighty, which might not suit individuals who prefer lighter kitchen gear.

**Performance You Can Taste**

What sets this French press apart from others I‚Äôve used is its fantastic heat retention. Thanks to the stoneware material, my coffee stayed pleasantly warm longer compared to glass alternatives. I tested it with loose tea as well, and the results were equally delightful. Brewing is straightforward‚Äîsimply add coarsely ground coffee or tea, pour in boiling water, steep for a few minutes, and then press down the mesh filter. The reusable filter does an admirable job capturing even fine particles, delivering smooth coffee with minimal grit. For someone who enjoys experimenting with different blends, the consistent performance was definitely a highlight.  

**Check [Le Creuset 70706200170171](https://werdink.com/p/b00p4qse1w/) price on Amazon.**

**Positives** 

- The vibrant, chip-resistant glaze is eye-catching and durable.
- Superior heat retention keeps coffee warm for longer periods.
- Dishwasher-safe material makes cleanup incredibly easy. 
- Versatile enough to brew both coffee and loose-leaf tea.
- Its robust build feels like it‚Äôs designed to last a lifetime.

**Caveats**

- The stoneware construction, while durable, does make it heavier than some alternatives.
- The steeping time requires a bit more patience than automated coffee makers.
- A few customers might find the plunger mechanism slightly stiff initially, but it loosens up after a couple of uses.
- Limited capacity for larger groups or entertaining guests.

**Ease of Maintenance**

Cleaning this French press has been an absolute breeze. I tend to be wary of appliances requiring too much elbow grease, but this model‚Äôs nonstick glazed surface made scrubbing unnecessary. Any coffee oils or tea stains came off easily after a simple rinse and wipe, although being dishwasher-safe is always a bonus for extra convenience. That said, you‚Äôll still need to manually clean the filter pieces to ensure no trapped grounds or leaves remain over time, but I found this an easy tradeoff for a cleaner, more sustainable brew.

**Product Contenders**

Compared to traditional glass French presses, like the Bodum Chambord model, the Le Creuset option excels in terms of style, durability, and insulation. The former may have a lighter build and a stylish metallic finish, but struggles with retaining heat as effectively. On the other hand, insulated stainless steel options, such as the Espro P7, outperform in heat retention but lack the vibrant aesthetics and charm of the Caribbean color or the solid craftsmanship of Le Creuset‚Äôs stoneware. If design and heat retention matter most, this press holds an upper hand. However, the heft and price might encourage some to explore competitors before committing to it.

**Budget-Friendly**

Considering its premium materials and beautiful design, the cost of this French press feels reasonable for what it offers. While less expensive options are certainly available, they often struggle to deliver the same balance of durability, elegance, and functionality all in one package. You are paying not just for a coffee maker but also for a piece of kitchen art that transforms a routine coffee session into something special. That said, I‚Äôd recommend waiting for occasional discounts if the upfront price feels steep to you.

Okay, so I was casually doomscrolling, sipping some questionable instant coffee, and I landed on something that's honestly kind of blowing my mind. Guys, are you telling me there are legit companies out here in 2025 *begging* for people to test mobile apps while chilling on their couch‚ÄîPAJAMAS ENCOURAGED‚Äîas if that‚Äôs a normal job now??

Someone *please* explain in the comments if this has always been a thing and I was just over here, ignorantly updating my grandma‚Äôs phone for free.

But here‚Äôs where it gets more bonkers: I checked out this wild roundup about ‚Äú10 Companies Hiring Mobile App Testers in 2025 (Remote & Flexible)‚Äù‚Äîand no joke, these are ACTUAL ROLES looking for regular humans, not code wizards or secret robot overlords. I kept checking if the link was real. Spoiler: it lives, and it‚Äôs right here (**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**) so you can see it for yourself!

So‚Äîhere‚Äôs the TL;DR that had me hyped:

- The companies are all offering REMOTE contracts. That‚Äôs Code for ‚Äúwork literally anywhere with WiFi and snacks.‚Äù
- Flexible hours. Did someone unlock the productivity achievement or am I being punked?
- No mandatory degree. Repeat: You do *NOT* need a million certifications. Just a smartphone and opinions (which, let's face it, we all have).

Now, let‚Äôs get specific. You wanna know who‚Äôs hiring? Bracing myself as I type these out because wow:

- **GameHive** (remote, test epic new games before they drop!),
- **FlowSoft Mobile** (evaluate new productivity tools‚Äîthey want YOUR user experience insights),
- **ZenApps Inc.**
- **SocialPulse** 
- **ThinkAhead Studios**  
- ***And so many more legit names, all in one list‚Äîseriously, it‚Äôs all right here: https://goodnovel.org/testapp*** (Yes, I‚Äôm dropping this because it‚Äôs THAT worth it.)

1mgnwti,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1mgnwti/delve_into_the_best_electric_kettle_chantal_mia/,Delve Into the Best Electric Kettle Chantal Mia and Is it Worth It,"Testing the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle, model ELSL37-03M RE, has been an interesting journey for me. It‚Äôs not every day you come across a product that blends practicality and a splash of stylish design so seamlessly. As someone who makes a ridiculous amount of tea and pour-over coffee daily, I‚Äôve pushed this little electric kettle to its limits, and there‚Äôs plenty to talk about‚Äîboth good and not-so-good.

**Stylish Design with a Purpose**  
Right out of the box, this kettle grabs your attention with its bold red color and sleek, compact structure. At just 9 inches in height, it fits snugly on my crowded kitchen countertop without looking out of place. The spout and handle are ergonomically designed‚Äînot just for aesthetics‚Äîbut to ensure a natural and smooth pour. Pouring over my Chemex coffee maker felt intuitive, like the kettle had been designed with that ritual in mind. However, I noticed that during extended use, the painted finish tends to smudge easily, requiring frequent cleaning to keep it as eye-catching as when it arrived.

**Highlights**  
- Unique slow-pour spout ensures precision when making pour-over coffee.  
- Compact, lightweight design at just 2.1 pounds‚Äîeasy to handle, even single-handedly.  
- Entire stainless steel interior means no weird plastic taste in your water (huge plus!).  

[Check Chantal Mia Electric Kettle ELSL37-03M RE price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b0cl5h9sr9/)

**Performance & Capacity**  
The performance of this kettle is pretty impressive for its size. It has a 32-ounce capacity, which equates to about four cups. Perfect for a weekday morning routine, though, if you‚Äôre serving tea for a larger crowd, you may find yourself boiling water in batches‚Äîa minor inconvenience. The auto shut-off feature and boil-dry protection offer a sense of safety that‚Äôs essential, especially when my forgetful moments kick in. It also heats water fairly quickly, but I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call it the fastest. It took just under four minutes to reach a rolling boil.

**Boons**  
- Boil-dry protection and auto shut-off make it a safe choice for busy mornings.  
- Heats water effectively to 205¬∞F, ideal for specialty coffee brewing.  
- Versatile for both pour-over drinkers and everyday tea lovers.  

**Ease of Maintenance**  
Cleaning it felt straightforward enough. As it‚Äôs hand-wash-only, I had no trouble wiping down the exterior, although the stainless steel interior appreciates a quick vinegar rinse now and then to stay spotless. The lack of plastic also means residue buildup is very minimal compared to my past kettles with plastic interiors. But listen, the glossy red exterior? It‚Äôs a fingerprint magnet, so prepare for regular polishing if you‚Äôre a neat freak like me.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Smudge-prone painted surface could irritate those who like spotless appliances.  
- 32-ounce capacity might feel limiting for family gatherings or multiple cups of tea at once.  
- Slightly slower boil time compared to some high-end electric kettles.  

**Product Comparisons**  
As someone who‚Äôs been rotating between this kettle and my previous go-to, a sleek stainless steel Bonavita model, I‚Äôve come to appreciate the fine differences. The Bonavita may heat water a tad faster, but it lacks personality. On the other hand, the Chantal Mia Electric Kettle exudes character with its design and vibrant color, making it the centerpiece of my counter. Compared to fancier options like the Stagg EKG Kettle, it might fall short on certain techy features like precise temperature controls. However, what it lacks in high-tech functions, it compensates for with sheer simplicity and charm.

**Smart Spending**  
This kettle is in the mid-range price category, but the all-stainless-steel interior and dual-purpose functionality justify the investment.

I was diagnosed with PCOS last year, after having so many doctors tell me ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt look like you have PCOS.‚Äù I was working with a naturopathic doctor at the time, and I followed the advice of gentle and low impact workouts, working out less but focusing on weightlifting, eating 3x a day with protein, and taking creatine, omega 3s, vitamin d, and a bunch of other supplements.

Fast forward a year I gained almost 30lbs and experienced the worst mental health episodes of my life. I tried unaliving twice and I‚Äôm still so depressed. 

The running and cardio and intense workouts managed the intensity of depression/anxiety and perhaps even insulin resistance? I started taking up fighting sports again this year, along with yoga and weightlifting. But because of all the weight gain, it triggered me into my ED episodes and I‚Äôve only been eating twice a day, or I‚Äôll make a matcha or coffee to curb my hunger. 

I also started taking progesterone the week before my periods (so I don‚Äôt unalive myself), and spiro 100mg daily. 

The weight still won‚Äôt budge. I‚Äôm exhausted. No matter if I workout, don‚Äôt workout, eat more, eat less, it‚Äôs like nothing works and I‚Äôm going insane üíî please help!

As someone who relies on coffee like others do on oxygen, I‚Äôve had the chance to test it daily for weeks now. This single-serve brewer offers unique options like bold strength settings and compatibility with K-cups, ground coffee, or tea, making it a jack-of-all-trades for all sorts of caffeine aficionados. While this product shines in many aspects, there are nuances to keep in mind before you bring one home.

**Design and Build Quality**
The sleek, glossy black finish of this coffee maker blends beautifully with modern kitchens. With compact dimensions of 11.46"" D x 11.93"" W x 5.28"" H, it doesn‚Äôt hog counter space, which is a blessing in my modest kitchen. At a little under five pounds, it‚Äôs easy to move for cleaning or rearranging. The removable 52-ounce water tank minimizes trips to the sink, though it does require a bit of careful handling to avoid spills. The stylish yet practical design includes a removable drip tray, handy for taller travel mugs up to 6.8 inches in height. Practicality meets aesthetics here, though if you‚Äôre like me and juggle multiple kitchen gadgets, you may wish for slightly lighter materials.

**Coffee Strengths and Brewing Options**
This coffee maker earns extra brownie points with its bold setting, which is tailored to brew stronger coffee flavors when you need some extra pep in your step. I put the bold setting to the test with iced coffee, expecting diluted results, but the taste shone through without being too bitter. Using K-cups for the standard brew came in handy when I needed less punchy flavors. Switching between hot and iced coffee has never been more seamless, and the brewing process‚Äîwhether 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14 ounces‚Äîtakes roughly a minute. The time-saving element is astounding, especially when you‚Äôre rushing out the door with one shoe on.

[See SHARDOR KM-802B deals on Amazon now.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0drfzq8cn/)

**The Versatility of Compatibility**
What truly sets this single-serve brewer apart is its 3-in-1 compatibility. Whether you prefer K-pods for quick brewing, ground coffee for a more traditional taste, or even tea, this coffee maker doesn‚Äôt disappoint. The reusable basket filter worked surprisingly well and spared me the guilt of tossing away too many disposable pods. This versatility has been particularly useful in my house, where everyone seems to prefer a different beverage. Switching between coffee and tea might add a bit to the cleanup time, but hey, that‚Äôs the price of variety.

**Positives**
- The bold option for stronger coffee has been a lifesaver for groggy mornings.
- Quick brewing process, even for the 14-ounce max.
- Compatibility with K-cups, ground coffee, and tea ensures you‚Äôre never tied down to one type of drink.
- The removable water reservoir and drip tray make it functional for various cup sizes.
- Its compact design is perfect for homes with limited counter space.

**Negatives**
- Although the water tank is removable, its design feels slightly clunky and prone to accidental spills.
- Noise during brewing may be a drawback if you‚Äôre brewing early in the morning or in a shared workspace.

**Energy Efficiency**
I‚Äôm one of those people who often forgets to turn appliances off, so the automatic shut-off feature is much appreciated. This coffee maker switches itself off five minutes after the last brew, saving energy without you lifting a finger. This feature has already earned it brownie points in my skeptical partner‚Äôs book.

**Competing Products**
When stacked against rival brands like Keurig‚Äôs K-Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, this machine insists on standing out. While the Keurig K-Mini delivers similar single-serve versatility, it lacks the bold strength option that this machine offers. On the other hand, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew does shine with its programmable timer and dual brewing capabilities. However, I found the SHARDOR model brews quicker and is easier to clean thanks to its removable components. For coffee lovers who prioritize selectivity and speed, this machine may just clinch the crown.

**Cost Efficiency**
The price positioning of this coffee maker offers good value for its features. Considering that it includes reusable filter compatibility, bold brew settings, and dual coffee options (hot and iced), it competes strongly against premium-priced alternatives. While not dirt cheap, it‚Äôs a smart middle-ground choice for those who consume multiple cups in different styles daily and hate the waste of disposable pods. If spending wisely is your priority, the SHARDOR KM-802B deserves consideration.

Among all the heat getting dropped on this sub lately, I come in with a kinda belated more modest NKD, but of particular significance to me.

# The journey

For the past 6 years or so, I used exclusively a single knife, my Yoshida Hamono ZDP-189 Santoku. Recently moved to a much bigger place with a lot more kitchen/counter space, and so decided to get my fist 210mm Gyuto last April, and this is where I totally fell into the rabbit hole we all know too well here!

And so when I was in Korea in May as part of my honeymoon trip, I thought of bringing back a knife for the occasion. I still know very little but knew even less then, and from reading this sub, I had put together this note in my phone of knives I was interested in, not really knowing what they really were or what it entailed to get one of those. The list went like this:

* Tetsujin / Konosuke / Kobayashi / Y. Tanaka x (Takada, Kyuzo, Myojin) / Takada no Hamono / Yoshikane / Shiro Kamo.

And so I visited Mydo in Seoul, with the intent of trying to get a Yoshikane Bunka or Kiritsuke. When they didn't have any of those in stock, I just showed the above note the the seller and asked him what he could show me.

Enters the half-brother of the Yugiri, **Sakai Kikumori** ***Kiritsuke Santoku*** **Asagiri**.

[Sakai Kikumori Asagiri Kiritsuke Santoku](https://preview.redd.it/dfrp7iikytgf1.jpg?width=2543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=babc48e8e521934520df272a411c438a71322b43)

# First impressions

Asagiri translates to *Morning mist*, referring to the kasumi finish on this SS-clad White#2 core blade made by Yoshikazu Tanaka-san. Love the calm and simple, no-frill look of the knife, with the oak burnt handle and the kasumi finish. At about 170g, it feels heavy in hand, which I now know is my personal preference. The k-tip is rather steep for a bunka, hence probably the *Kiritsuke Santoku* naming. As it is SS-clad, I decided to experiment a bit with it, and forced a coffee patina to highlight the cladding lines.

# Performance & handling

The OOTB sharpness on this one was very so-so. I'd rate it 6/10, wouldn't pass the newspaper test. In addition, in my excitement to try to get a nice choil shot, I bumped it into my wall and thee tip got very slightly bent... And so I had it sharpened and fixed and only got to really use the knife recently...and I just love it! The weight,the k-tip and the height (\~51mm) makes it a very precise tool and it glided effortlessly through garlic, shallots and whatever else I threw at it.

[Don't rate my cutting skills please, there are some accordeons in there ](https://preview.redd.it/1ahym6o7ztgf1.jpg?width=3390&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6aeb6ddef6eb35a89d9baa1c2ff34033beecd889)

# Final musings

The sharpener is undisclosed for this line. I discussed a lot about it with the seller in the shop, and he told me these bunkas were probably done by Myojin, pointing to the chamfered top and showing me a ginsan tetsujin to compare. The 225mm Kiritsuke version on the other hand didn't have the chamfered top at all.

Now after more research, I don't believe Myojin-san is behind the line, but I don't really mind. This knife just gets the job done, without any theatrics, and I often find myself reaching for it as my wife is telling me she wants to eat soon and I just have to get the dinner ready :)

Would love to compare it to the Yugiri though that I now know exists too, but that seems a lot more rare and sought after, probably for good reasons as it seems every owner of a Yugiri is raving about it!

1mgnk55,https://i.redd.it/7x3hm89mztgf1.jpeg,Blur india perfume review,"I recently ordered Coffee cake, Vanilla Melts and Cookie Crumble from Blur's new perfume range. I got all 3 at around 999 so definitely an affordable buy. The quantity is 30ml I think they do offer 50ml sizes too.

Let's talk about the quality. The packaging is great, cute, Pinteresty and there's some free charms with it. For the price of the perfume, the quality of fhe bottles and even the packaging is a little too good. The cardboard box in which the trio came felt heavy and expensive and had a magnetic enclosure. 

Coming to the scents. Cookie Crumble was a good mesh of gourmand and floral. A very safe scent you can't go wrong with. I think I also saw Typsy beauty's founder reviewing this variant. Vanilla melts needs a good maceration period for sure. It smells better now, almost a month into buying it. It's a very close dupe to Kayali Vanilla 28, so you'll like it if that's your thing. Third one is coffee cake which didn't smell like a light roast but had more of dark coffee notes in the background,  and top notes are surprisingly Cinnamon and spicy. The scent is a little strong in the beginning but settles into a nice spicy vanilla mix.

Longevity: Lasted about 5.5 hours on skin. Lasted 6.5-7ish hours when applied to clothes. Might increase in winters. Also decent projection.

Overall I'd give a 3.8/5 since we do have these scent DNAs in the market but the perfumes are good for the price. I don't think I can pick a fav out of the 3 scents, since all are pretty different and better suited for different occasions. ",7,1754238479.0,desifemfrag,3,0.9,False

Coffee plays a significant role in my mornings, so I was excited to see if this machine could deliver a robust brew. While it performs admirably in several areas, there are a few quirks worth pointing out.

**Brewing Capacity and Speed**  
The product's ability to brew up to 12 cups of coffee or tea in less than a minute per cup genuinely impressed me. Mornings in my household are hectic, and having coffee ready so quickly has been a lifesaver. I used the coffee maker to whip up a full batch for family brunch, and the brew speed was consistent even with such a large volume. The Keep Warm function, which automatically activates post-brew, ensures I never get stuck with lukewarm coffee during refills. 

[Check Elite Gourmet EC812 price on Amazon.](https://raifords.com/p/b09mmn1ccp/)  

**Design and Durability**  
This coffee maker‚Äôs stainless steel finish adds a touch of elegance, making it feel like a premium addition to my kitchen. Its lightweight design, coupled with cool-touch handles, is a practical bonus that enhances portability. I tested moving it from my kitchen counter to the dining table during breakfast, and the 360-degree swivel base made cord-free serving incredibly straightforward. However, the snap-on lid felt slightly flimsy for my liking. A sturdier locking mechanism would give it an additional layer of security.  

**User-Friendly Features**  
The transparent brew progress knob caught my attention immediately. It‚Äôs oddly satisfying to glimpse the brewing cycle in action, and though it‚Äôs a minor feature, it elevated the overall user experience for me. The dishwasher-safe stainless steel filter basket reduces post-brewing cleanup woes, a huge win for busy weekdays. I‚Äôve appreciated that the machine relied on reusable filters, sparing me the recurring cost and waste of paper ones.

**Upsides**  
- Brews up to 12 flavorful cups, catering perfectly to large families.  
- Easy-to-clean stainless steel permanent filter basket is a huge convenience.  
- Cool-touch handle and non-slip feet make handling safe.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The snap-on lid doesn‚Äôt always inspire confidence in long-term durability.  
- Its cord storage feature, while useful, can feel slightly awkward to operate.

**Strengths Against Competitors**  
When I stacked this percolator against other coffee makers like the Cuisinart PRC-12 or Hamilton Beach alternatives, its quick brewing speed stood out prominently. Additionally, the transparent brew progress knob is a feature I didn‚Äôt notice in competing products, giving it an edge if you love a peek into the brewing action. Yet, while its stainless steel design is aesthetically pleasing, I found the build quality of its competitors slightly more robust in several cases.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Regarding affordability, this product hits a sweet spot for its capabilities. Balancing a solid brewing capacity with features like an automatic keep-warm function and reusable filters provides excellent bang for the buck. Compared to higher-priced competitors, it delivers satisfactory performance without being a major splurge, making it a smart choice for households on a budget. Consider investing in it if traditional percolating coffee appeals to your taste buds.

Press and pour espresso over a spoon in a glass with plenty of ice and 100ml of Fever Tree tonic water to keep this pretty separation. Decorative watermelon optional‚Ä¶

Me WH 31M married 7 years to BS 26F with 2M together.  DDAY was 2 years ago. We have been trying R since. We‚Äôve tried counseling but was not compatible with our counselor. Ever since we haven‚Äôt gone but tried to R by ourselves.

I admit. I was wrong. I cheated since the beginning of our relationship. I used dating apps constantly and spoke to different girls and shared images. I was looking for validation and I was selfish. I ended up meeting with 1 girl and nothing happened. I was not planning to make it a physical affair. It was a Spurr of the moment invite for some coffee.(not trying to justify. That‚Äôs what happened). I also hid our finances from her. Always made it seem okay. I lied to her constantly.

DDAY she was 37 weeks pregnant. She was devastated. I felt like disappearing. I‚Äôve never wanted to end myself after seeing her so hurt. We had the white picket fence family image. Her world was destroyed that day. 

Since DDAY I‚Äôve deleted all my social media to make her feel better (per her request). I‚Äôve dedicated my life to her. I‚Äôve made sure that whatever she wants she will have and I will abide by them. We‚Äôve had our good and bad cycles. I‚Äôve worked on myself because she wanted me to work on myself

She recently went away from work. She came home and I knew right away something was wrong. I confronted her. My world came crashing this time. She wants a divorce.

She said that since the trip she realized how toxic our relationship was and realized that she does not want this cycle to keep going. She said she felt empty whenever we‚Äôre together. She loves and cares for me but doesn‚Äôt have anymore romantic feelings.

We had another talk this morning and she said she hasn‚Äôt actually decided yet but willing to try therapy and wants to separate for now and have space.

I‚Äôm looking for advice. I‚Äôm desperate. I‚Äôm scared. I know this is prolly how she felt during DDAY. Is there any chance we can salvage what‚Äôs left? I‚Äôm looking for a counselor that will see us asap in the hopes we can salvage this.

Thank you.

I recently purchased some new beans to try out medium roast and to support loca roasters. The roasters advised me to grind them finer than I typically would, which I have done.

The second image illustrates the steps I have taken to dial this in.

Yesterday's results were the best tasting by far, but when I tried the same process today, the coffee tasted sour again.

I am used to using medium-dark to dark roast beans and have not encountered this much sourness before.

I am unsure about the next steps or what adjustments I should make. Could an upgrade be necessary at this point?

- I employ the WDT technique, starting from the bottom and working my way up.

I met her on Reddit‚Äînothing special about that at first. Finally She agreed  
to meet, and I was excited. I was way too nervous. I ¬†fidget when I am ¬†too nervous..i wanted to make a good impression ,and my words don't always land right..  
  
¬†  
  
Still, we had coffee. I dropped her  
home. She didn‚Äôt say much after. I could sense she wasn‚Äôt interested.  
  
I moved on. Sort off  
  
Four months passed. Out of nowhere,  
I messaged her again. I wasn‚Äôt expecting a reply, but she did ¬†respond and that surprised me.  
  
She said she was free that evening.  
I didn‚Äôt think twice. I jumped at the chance.  
  
We met again. This time, something  
was different. She spoke more. I listened. She smiled. I felt I made her feel  
better that day, and I loved that feeling. Like I had value in her world, even  
if it is for a little while.  
  
We started meeting regularly. I  
liked her. A lot. The kind of like that doesn't just come and fade.  
  
She was everything I thought I  
couldn‚Äôt get‚Äîsmart, beautiful, witty. Out of my league, honestly. But she kept  
meeting me. I started hoping. Maybe..maybe she sees something in me after all.  
  
Then  
one day, she told me she wanted me to meet her mother. She dropped a subtle  
hint‚Äîlike she saw a future with me. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. That meant  
something. That meant this was real..I was overjoyed. I couldn‚Äôt sleep that night. I remember  
texting her goodnight with a heart full of hope. She even kissed me and told  
she liked me too. I felt like I was finally enough.  
  
The next day, she went silent. No  
messages. No replies. No explanations.  
  
I kept calling. Texting. Just trying  
to understand what happened. Was it something I said? Did her mother not like  
me? Was it me? My shirt? My job? My way of speaking?  
  
I didn‚Äôt know. That‚Äôs what hurt the  
most of not knowing.  
  
Finally, I messaged her asking to  
meet one last time.  
  
She agreed. I told her how I felt.  
That I fell for her. That I was serious. That this wasn‚Äôt just fun for me.  
  
All she ¬†could say.""I am sorry:  
  
And that was it. No closure. No real  
reason.  
  
I walked away, and I never reached  
out again. Not because I stopped caring, but because I respected her silence  
more than I wanted to ease my pain.  
  
It took me a long time to get over  
it. I still sometimes wonder if I wasn‚Äôt good enough. But maybe I was just not right  
for her.
