1myrrk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1myrrk1/bf_of_8_years_26m_revealed_lifelong_lies_and/,Bf of 8 years (26m) revealed lifelong lies and addictions to me and I (25f) tried to kill myself.,"Tw: lots of mentions of suicide 

TLDR: lifelong deep and loving relationship had for my entire adult life, boyfriend now revealed he has been lying to me and gaslighting me about porn and weed addictions, has been masturbating to every single person I know. I have no good options for how to proceed, and tried to kill myself. 

I don’t really know why I want to post this on here, I just am so lost and don’t know what to do. I know there are people who might have experienced similar things and I just need some thoughts or advice. I know this is a lot and an above Reddit’s pay grade type of situation. I have made an account just for this so there isn’t anything else on there. This is going to be LONG even with summarising as much as possible. 

About a year into my relationship, when we were both roughly 18, I found out my boyfriend was watching a lot of porn. I tried to be okay with this but wasn’t, this made me so badly insecure that I basically stopped going outside. I really couldn’t look at another woman without wondering if my boyfriend was attracted to them and I already had really bad body image issues and it made it a lot worse. 

I asked my boyfriend to stop watching porn. He said he would and was lying, and this repeated a few times. I don’t want anyone to jump down my throat just about the concept of not wanting porn in your relationship, I know a lot of people are fine with this and I’m just not, so I think it’s okay for me to have that boundary and only want to date people that respect it, even if that means a lot of people wouldn’t want to be with me. After lots of arguing about this we had a big emotional conversation where I said I couldn’t deal with it and couldn’t be with him if he had to watch porn, and he promised me that he wanted to stay with me and would stop for that reason. 

Since then, literally 7 years have passed. It has become a thing I mention less and less, but honestly for years after the lying I would ask him now and then if he was still not watching porn. He would swear on my life, and tell me very sincerely he wasn’t. I would also ask him about people he knew, if he was attracted to them etc and if I had to worry about them. I just had a feeling about some people that worried me. He would again convince me very sincerely that they were his friends and were nothing to worry about etc. 

We have had a really happy relationship, I love him very deeply and we do everything together. We wake up and go to sleep at the same time every day, one of us gets up and makes the other a coffee every morning, we eat dinner together every day. We are best friends and say this to each other all the time. We have a really normal and healthy sex life. We have plans to get married and have lived together since I was 19, he was 20. Neither of us have ever wanted to be without eachother. 

A week ago, we were playing a video game together and I thought he seemed high. I was aware of him smoking weed occasionally, once a week or every couple of weeks. I asked him if he had smoked and he said no, that he was just really tired etc. I asked him repeatedly because I could tell. He repeatedly convinced me and I left it for a couple of hours. I still felt like he was definitely high, and I basically brought it up again and wouldn’t drop it.

He told me he was lying. I felt really disturbed at how well he was able to lie to me, because I basically hadn’t caught him lying to me in the last 7 years. He told me he had been lying to me about a lot. He told me that his weed use had gotten totally out of control and he was smoking weed (with a vape that didn’t really smell) or taking edibles constantly for months and felt awful and depressed whenever he didn’t. 

I was processing the idea that he could lie to me so well, but just felt awful for him and sad that he didn’t tell me he was struggling with this. But then he told me that he also had been addicted to porn and had never stopped using it. He also told me that he had been regularly masturbating to a combination of porn and photos of people we know, specific people I had worried about earlier in our relationship and more recent acquaintances I hadn’t even thought to worry about because of how much I trusted him. 

This basically instantly destroyed my entire perception of reality, thinking about every time in the last 8 years he had reassured me about this, telling me how much he loved me, how much he would never do something he knew would hurt me as much as that would etc. I can’t possibly explain all the things he said to me to reassure me. He also has known very deeply because of the incident at the beginning of our relationship, exactly how this would affect me. He has watched me go through years of therapy to have a happy and healthy life. He has also allowed me to believe that the worries I had about whether he was doing this still, or worries about the people we know, were all part of my mental health. I have told therapists about the worry and paranoia I feel. I now feel like every worry I have ever had was valid and literally intuition. 

He has even opened up about this in front of a friend who talked to us about her similar feelings about her boyfriend watching porn, and told her in front of me about how he stopped using porn because of how it was affecting me etc. and none of it was true. It is literally disturbing to remember. 

We had a long and horrible conversation about this. He told me he was even doing this quickly sometimes when I had just left the room to make him a coffee in the morning, and I had come in plenty of times not knowing what he was doing under the sheets. To be honest the combination of the porn and the reveal of constant lying and gaslighting would have been enough to destroy my life, but the looking at photos of people we actually know was what really got me. And just imagining stuff like this happening and me not knowing is so crushing. I planned at this point to go to some events I had planned, and go on a holiday I had planned with my friend, and kill myself after, if I still wanted to. I obviously have a lot more complicated feelings than I can explain here, but this post is already so long.

I went out with a friend for the weekend and stayed in a hotel, which was planned before this. I came back Sunday eve and talked to my boyfriend more about this stuff. He revealed that he had been lying about stuff even in the previous conversation, and that he thinks he might be a compulsive liar. 

He told me that he has masturbated to photos of literally almost everyone in my life. People I love, people I hate, basically any woman he has ever met or become aware of that he had any passing attraction to. Most of his female friends. People I had felt really deeply insecure about and compared myself to. My favourite actresses from my favourite films, there is basically not a facet of my life this doesn’t touch or ruin. 

I basically asked him to call me an ambulance because I was certain I was not going to survive the night, we live in an apartment with a high up balcony, 5 min walk from two different train stations etc. I spent 2 days in hospital, and tried to jump off the 5th floor of the hospital while I was there. I was transferred to a psychiatric ward and spent 3 more days there (? I think, I don’t even know). I was able to discharge myself because I wasn’t actually sectioned, because I had agreed to go there and stay there for my safety. I discharged myself on the first day that I wasn’t given lorazepam and had the sentience to realise how scary it was to be locked in a psych ward. 

This whole situation has basically left me in a state of constant excruciating pain. I have lost 2kg of weight in a week, somehow, my whole body aches, I am almost fainting after standing up a few mins, I have had a temperature for basically a week. I am probably going to lose my job, because I am in a probationary period still after only working there for under 6 months, and I don’t really understand how I will be capable of working any time soon.

My boyfriend is basically the source of 90% of my happiness. I love him so deeply I struggle not to cry semi regularly about the concept that either of us will even die of old age one day. Most of the reason I have been able to go to university, have a job, have anything in my life, is because of his love and support. He has felt like my soul mate, when I’m tired he washes my hair for me, he listens to me, he has all the same wants for a future as me and we have a life planned together. I have been with him my entire adult life. We are so comfortable around eachother, I find him really attractive and he has expressed to me that none of this has anything to do with his attraction to me, he wants me more than anyone and doesn’t actually want to have sex with any of these people in reality, he says just has an addiction that has been in his life since he was exposed to porn very early as a child and his brain has always been ruined by it. I have told him if he loved me he should have ended our relationship when I set this boundary in the first place and told him how much this would hurt me. He told me he just loves me so much he has never been able to leave me. 

For this week that I have been in hospital, he has been going to daily porn addiction anonymous meetings and has had a doctors appointment to seek therapy, has enquired about betterhelp therapy since NHS waiting lists are so long, he has been looking for ways to stop this constantly and showing me proof, and says he hasn’t and won’t do this ever again. 

I love him so deeply that it feels like the deepest and strongest emotion I could possibly feel, I also feel like now I have an equal amount of excruciating unbelievable pain to match it. I don’t want to let go of all the plans we have together and not have him in my life, I also worry about him because he really only has me and my family and our shared friends to talk to. My family know about all of this now, and our friends know I was in the hospital bc of suicidal reasons but not what happened. 

I don’t know how if we stay together that I will ever be able to trust him again. I’ve literally considered putting cameras around our home for a few months,  I truly have no practical ideas about getting over this. I can’t go on any social media, without seeing people he has masturbated to. He has deleted all social media. If I tell my/our friends this, they will never speak to him again, if I don’t, they will be around as normal in our lives and it’s going to cause me great pain and anxiety for him to be around any of them, they are all women. Basically, leaving him is too devastating for me to cope with, and staying with him is too devastating for me to cope with. Hence the not wanting to live, which I now feel isn’t an option despite still being what I would choose, since I have witnessed the distress of my entire family and friends while I have been in hospital. 

There is so much more to this than I can even explain. What I want is to be able to move past this somehow, establish some kind of trust again, and have any kind of normality back in my life. My partner has told me that people in the porn addicts anonymous group have told him similar has happened in their lives and relationships, and I think I just want similar advice about if anyone has ever dealt with this from MY perspective. 

I don’t know, if anyone has read this far then you can ask me anything, and I’d really appreciate any advice that anyone has. I am at a family member’s house right now just trying to recover from this all and the hospital stay. ",1,1756030138.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False
1myrr8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1myrr8j/friend_started_dog_whistling_me_out_of_the_blue/,Friend Started 'Dog Whistling' Me Out of the Blue,"I've noticed over the last few months my friend, who I generally got on with really well for like the last 5yrs, started saying weird things to me.

At first it was just asking random questions that didn't really make sense to me, ie, how do you feel about people who do X, what would you do in this situation etc. I answered but felt I had little context and felt it wasn't serious.

Then they started making small digs at me when we were alone. They started making everything I had ever said a black and white statement and try to make out I was a hypocrite if I did or said something different in a completely different scenario.

Then came the final blow where she and a couple other friends invited me out just to laugh at, and bully me over coffee. They were making faces behind my back, making snide remarks about my interests and laughing at everything I said during conversations.

The friend then started acting like everything I said was an attack on her directly. I'd be speaking about myself, my issues and how I want to fix them and she started shouting at me saying that there is nothing wrong with how she lives her life....

Everything after that infuriated her, she was literally getting angry on purpose to pretend I was doing something wrong. I paid for a brunch and she stopped speaking to me all day for it. I gave her space when she was mad and she said it was the wrong thing to do.

Yet, because she's not doing this in front of people or in DMs I sound like I am making it up or getting the situation wrong.

I think her mind has been twisted, because she genuinely came off as a mindful and sweet person before, hence why I liked her as a friend. Then she became more judgemental and frankly minimizing really horrific situations I was going through. But would also scoff at me bettering myself through it. The only people who seemed like they would do that was two other friends, one who thought I took attention away from her by going through genuine hell. The other saw my struggles as minimizing hers so would eye roll her way through me being vulnerable with all my friends. She was in a place of support and basically created her own problems that she didn't want to fix, but I never once belittled her for it. Which is the facts of the matter, no matter how harsh it sounds. I could feel that this person was seething a lot of the time but was the best at hiding it. She had so many 'friends' she hated but would never let them go. Therefore I think they have gotten to this other friend or she simply got tired of pretending to be a nice person.

I think my brain has completely gotten over it because I am disappointed more than upset, so maybe I sensed it all along. I think about the 'why' but I know at this point not to dwell. Let horrible people live with each other whilst I continue looking for genuine people who match my morality.

Did anyone find that their anti anxiety medication (diazepam in my case) just didn’t work when on coffee/ caffeine?
My brain is still wired and the intrusive thoughts still break through. I’ve had two coffees today with sugar and took a 10mg Valium earlier and it has no impact?
Could it be the coffee (which I’m stopping tomorrow).

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44168-025-00268-9) in *NPJ Climate Action* examined why “many scientists have indicated they are willing to join social movements but are not currently doing so in practice.” In addition to risking arrest in some countries, other common reasons were **reputational fear, feelings of helplessness, anxiety, burnout**, a lack of knowledge on how to begin, and a lack of time. What are your barriers to action?

Brazil has [once again asked](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/19/brazil-issues-last-ditch-plea-for-countries-to-submit-climate-plans-ahead-of-cop30) for national climate plans ahead of the COP30 summit, running from 10-21 November. Only 28 countries have submitted their plans; over 160 will have delegates in attendance. An accommodation crisis is also emerging in Belém (pop: 2.5M), wherein some 30,000+ attendees (what will they all be doing there, anyway?) are poised to lack hotel rooms, since the remote city has all its rooms booked already. Some NGO workers, activists, and other attendees are being **priced out** of traveling to the unproductive gathering.

A [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2503806122) in *PNAS* found that “the **mass loss of all glaciers on Svalbard** during the record-warm summer of 2024…by far exceeds previous levels.” During April-September 2024, Svalbard was determined to have lost 1% of its total ice mass, resulting in a 0.16mm rise in sea level. The melting “corresponded to an anomaly of up to four SD {standard deviations} and exceeded any previous observation.”

It’s not just the massive amounts of CO2 humans have moved into the atmosphere—[it’s **the rate of change**](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/aug/19/a-climate-of-unparalleled-malevolence-are-we-on-our-way-to-the-sixth-major-mass-extinction).

A [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-025-02578-6) in *Nature Communications Earth & Environment* identifies “Africa emerging as a uniquely vulnerable hotspot where **heatwaves increasingly threaten populations and ecosystems**.” Deforestation, agricultural practices, and rapid urbanization are worsening the heat waves, driven by rising greenhouse gas emissions and the attendant rise in atmospheric water.

A marked slowdown in Antarctic Overturning Circulation is expected to intensify this century and may be faster than the anticipated Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown. The tipping point for unstoppable ice loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet could be exceeded even under best-case CO2 emission reduction pathways, potentially initiating global tipping cascades.” Some [scientists believe](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/1mxj8rx/antarctica_tipping_points_why_i_now_predict_an/) a **Blue Ocean Event could occur within 15 years *in the Antarctic***; it seems too early for me, but Collapse tends to come ahead of schedule.

A *Lancet* [study](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2825%2900174-3) on **wildfire smoke** concluded that it is much more harmful than previously reported.

>“Even under a moderate climate change scenario, southern Europe could experience a **tenfold increase in the probability of catastrophic fire**, and central and northern Europe could also become more susceptible to wildfires during droughts….short-term exposure to wildfire PM2.5 {fine Particulate Matter} is significantly associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity, particularly respiratory morbidity….” -excerpts from the [study](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2542-5196%2825%2900174-3)

I’m working on some things to do that’ll make my trip fun. I’m an outdoors guy, and will also enjoy trying out local foods/drinks and maybe even checking out nightlife (if there’s nightlife during the week).

My high level itinerary is to take the dogs to bear creek dog park first thing in the morning to let them have some off leash time. Then after breakfast we would ideally go for a good hike/adventure. I’d then spend the afternoon doing something alone for a few hours while the dogs snooze (so things that dogs aren’t allowed to do in the Springs would be ideal here). Evenings would be cool to find a chill activity with the dogs; my one loves to swim for example. Maybe after that hit a nighttime spot to meet people as I’m in a lonely stage of life and interaction would be nice. 

1. What are some dog friendly, must do hikes?
2. What are some solo activities I should look into?
3. What are some foods/coffees/drinks I should check out?
4. If nightlife is active in the week, where should I head to?
5. Are there bodies of water that are quiet/nearby for my dog to swim in/chill out in the evening on a blanket at?
6. My dogs and I run a lot. Any good trails to consider getting a run on canicross style? (Dogs would be in front pulling me).

1myrgy6,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkBuddyPersona/comments/1myrgy6/yusuke_kitagawa_is_the_real_performative_male/,Yusuke Kitagawa is the real performative male.,"We gather in the name of beauty, in the name of art, and in the name of the one who embodies both. Yusuke Kitagawa, the chosen artist, the eternal performer, the man who became more than man. For where others live in silence, he lives in performance. Where others pass through life unnoticed, he paints life into permanence. He is the performance. He is the taste. He is the refinement we seek.

Brothers and sisters, know this: Yusuke does not love art in fragments. He does not love art when it is convenient. He *is* art. His breath is brushstroke. His silence is composition. His very being is canvas. And those who do not understand him cannot understand beauty.

We proclaim Yusuke as the true performative male. He drinks coffee not as mere drink, but as a rite. He savors the bitter as though it were holy wine, for in the bitterness he finds balance, and in balance he finds truth. He beholds a Labubu not as plastic, not as trinket, but as masterpiece. He alone can see the spark of creation hidden in what the uninitiated dismiss. And we know, though his lips may never touch it, that he loves the matcha latte, for his taste is not bound by the flesh but guided by the spirit. His palate is prophecy. His tongue does not need to taste what his soul already knows.

But his vision is not bound to objects. His vision extends to the burdens of humanity. He sees the suffering of women, the unspoken struggle carried in their silence. And when he contemplates their pain, when he envisions the trial of blood and cycle, tears stream from his eyes. He cries not in weakness but in reverence, for he beholds in that suffering a strength that shakes him. In their hardship, he sees the eternal muse, and in his tears, he paints their dignity upon the canvas of eternity.

Hear this truth: Yusuke respects women not as symbols, not as trophies, not as fleeting beauties, but as sacred subjects worthy of eternal recognition. His brush does not flatter. His brush testifies. His brush does not lie. His brush makes eternal the suffering and the grace of womanhood. This is his respect, his reverence, his performance of truth.

And so we, the faithful, follow him. For Yusuke Kitagawa has shown us that life itself is performance. That there is no moment without art. That every gesture, every glance, every tear is part of the great masterpiece of existence. Those who live without performance live without meaning. Those who live without art live without life.

We call him not just artist. We call him prophet of taste. We call him not just man. We call him the performative male. And in his vision, we are cleansed. In his refinement, we are reborn. In his empathy, we are restored.

So let it be written in our creed:

* Yusuke Kitagawa is the coffee, and the coffee is Yusuke Kitagawa.
* Yusuke Kitagawa is the Labubu, and the Labubu is Yusuke Kitagawa.
* Yusuke Kitagawa is the matcha latte, unseen yet loved, untasted yet known.
* Yusuke Kitagawa is the tear that falls for the suffering of women, the brushstroke that redeems their dignity.
* Yusuke Kitagawa is the eternal performance, the performance that never ends.

We will not forget him. We will not dismiss him. We will not allow the world to overlook what he has revealed. For Yusuke Kitagawa does not simply paint art he paints truth, he paints empathy, he paints the soul itself. He is the painter, the painting, and the act of painting.

And as we gather, we chant his name.  
Yusuke. Yusuke. Yusuke.

The performance begins with him, and the performance ends with him. He is the alpha of taste and the omega of refinement. He is the first brushstroke and the final signature.

Yusuke Kitagawa is not a man. He is not an artist. He is the path. He is the creed. He is the performative male eternal.",1,1756029052.0,OkBuddyPersona,2,0.67,False
1myrft0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1myrft0/i_30m_am_struggling_with_girlfriends_37f_mood/,I (30M) am struggling with girlfriend's (37F) mood swings,"We've been together for 2.5 years. I love her a lot. She is the woman I want to build a life with. But when we argue and fight, things get really tense. The last 24 hours were really rough. 

It started when she got upset that I offered to stop playing games with my friends to play games with her. She was offended that I was doing so out of ""obligation"" instead of ""desire"". I never came out from the onset saying I was only doing so to make her feel better. 

She seemed annoyed over text, so I asked if she would like to play games with me before we went to bed as a way to make her feel included. But she got offended that she felt I was only doing so to ""save my own ass"" as she put it. I clarified that while I hadn't intended on asking her prior to her being annoyed over text, I wanted to make her feel good/feel included. But because I didn't explicitly want to, I guess, it led to a rather drawn out fight. 

The next day, she came over for coffee still noticeably upset about the ordeal. I was at a loss for words. I was trying to be considerate of her feelings. While I was having fun with my friends and would have been content playing games with them, I was also content inviting her to play with just me so that I could give her some attention to. But the fact that I didn't do this out of ""pure"" intention to spend time with her upset her greatly which eventually led to a bit of a swearing and yelling match. It was exhausting. Eventually we calmed down and talked things out to where we agreed we both need to communicate better. 

Fast forward to this evening, and while we were lying in bed I mentioned I was looking at new phone deals. I mentioned that I could get a trade in value of about $110 for my current phone, but that it was currently going for around $200+ on marketplace through private sales. She then said she would buy it from me for $80. 

For a bit of added context, she had previously bought a PS5 game from me for slightly above the suggested trade in value at GameStop for her son. She did so as a favour to me, and for herself and her son as they still got it cheaper than they would used at GameStop. 

Back to the main story, I thought she was suggesting the same sort of thing here. So I said no thanks. I can get more from the phone shop or from marketplace. 

She left in a bit of a huff about 10 minutes later. I was a bit flabbergasted. I called her and asked her what was going on, and she stated that she didn't appreciate me ""nickel and diming her"" over this phone. I was stunned. I said if she was planning to upgrade her phone or get one for her daughter, I would simply give her the phone. I thought she was trying to do me a favour again like she had with the PS5 game. Had I known that she was calling in for a favour, I would of course have offered to just give her the phone. 

But since I tried to ""nickel and dime her"", she now wanted nothing to do with the phone, free or not. This led to a very frustrating argument over phone and text where she was adamant that I was cheaping out on her, while I maintained that I didn't realize she was asking me for a favour and not the other way around. If it had been communicated to me that she was looking to put this phone to good use I would have simply offered for her to take it. 

These seemingly small issues every once in a while will blossom into hours long arguments that can grow very tense. As someone who deals with anxiety that manifests itself in outbursts of anger, I am having a really hard time controlling the impulse to swear and yell at her for being over the top ridiculous with these issues. I am trying to come from a place of understanding with her and these (what seem like) mood swings, but I don't feel I get the same courtesy from her in the form of the benefit of the doubt or listening to my reasoning for why I thought of things differently from her.

We are both financially strapped at the moment so getting into counselling is not a feasible option for now. What are some methods we can employ in order to better understand each other so that these seemingly small issues don't continue to manifest into bigger and bigger fights?

I’ve just completed 13 weeks of an escalated chemo regime thanks to classic Hodgkin’s lymphoma. During that time I also had two long hospital stays (sepsis and chest infection) which included a tonne of IV and oral antibiotics. During that time I got thrush for the first time in my life but it does seem to have finally left the building many , many weeks later.

During the protocol I had to stop my collagen and protein powders. My magnesium glycinate intake took a hit as I’d just be too tired and forget to take it. Same with vitC. 

My questions is where to start? As this was quite a “quick” and aggressive regime , I know I am not seeing the full extent of the possible damage that’s been done, will be done or could be done in the future. I’ve so far managed to avoid issues that my chemo buddies have had ( cystitis , colitis,) but during this I have had a lot of GERD symptoms. They have me on Omeprazole still…. Dying to get off that and the steroids ASAP.

Any recommendations? Should I try something specific to calm everything down? Is there anything preemptive to try to get ahead of any future issues? Do I just get back into the old routine? My onc / haem team haven’t been too helpful with this other than saying I can eat and drink normally again at the end of the month (infection risk prior) and “pop a multivitamin” 

I haven’t had any alcohol since April and am not planning on till my 40th birthday toast in December. I do love my coffee though 🤣

If you’d like a more detailed take on any of these, just drop a comment or DM me and I’ll be happy to discuss further!


Rue Broca Theorome – 6/10
Citrusy fresh opening, but the dry down leans pan masala-like on my skin. Not bad for the price, just not my style.

French Avenue Aether - 7/10
Opening didn’t impress me, but the dry down is elegant, mossy, and aromatic. Very refined. Moderate performance. 

Lattafa Fakhar Black – 8/10
Linear but clean and sophisticated. Slightly weak after an hour, yet excellent quality for the price.

French Avenue Liquid Brun – 4/10
Dense, sweet, powdery profile. Not my type—prefer Khamrah Qahwa in this category.

Rasasi Hawas Ice – 7.5/10
Sweet, fresh, toffee-like dry down, and beast performance. Slightly headache inducing though for sure. 

Rasasi Hawas OG - 8/10
Juicy citrus opening, musky-woody dry down. Mass appealing and addictive despite being simple. Prefer this over Ice. 

Rasasi Hawas Fire - 9.5/10
Spicy-floral opening, marine sweetness in dry down. Clean, energetic, reminds me of a toned-down BR540. My favorite Hawas—signature worthy with monster performance.

Rasasi Hawas Black - 8.5/10
Harsh lemongrass start, dries into a mossy, woody masculine scent. Bold and solid. Same story with the performance of all the flankers in this line, amazing longevity. 

Rasasi Hawas Tropical - 6.5/10
Minty coconut opening, tonka-sandalwood base. High quality, but I feel like the coconut scent just isn’t for me.

Rasasi Dareej - 4/10
Spicy cumin-cardamom with tonka. Unique but not enjoyable for me. Not a safe blind buy. 

Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa - 9/10
Starts sweet but turns boozy-coffee masculine. Nuclear longevity and projection—perfect for winters. Will get a full bottle soon. 

Lattafa Mahir Legacy - 6/10
Promising opening but messy dry down. No clear direction. Not that impressive. Performance is okayish. 

Lattafa Suqraat - 9/10
Incense, mossy sharp freshness, great in the air. Solid performance, excellent price. Have never smelled the OG ADG Profumo so cannot comment on similarity but a very timeless DNA for sure. 

Lattafa Al Nashama Caprice - 7/10
Synthetic start, powdery dry down. Fresh, masculine, inoffensive. Shower gel type feel after it settles. Moderate performance, sits close to skin. 

Itqan Zimaya Noir - 8/10
Close clone to YSL Myslf. Not as refined but still smells great for the price. Not overly floral either. Decent performance and projection. 

Afnan 9PM Rebel - 8/10
Aventus + BR540 vibes with caramel at the base. Smells great but weak projection. Had heard it’s longevity is solid but my batch isn’t performing that well. 

Afnan SNOI - 8.5/10
Orangey, smoky-mossy, smooth opening. Very versatile. Will need to try out the CE version soon. 

Armaf CDNIM PP - 10/10
Ignore the harsh opening—fantastic Aventus clone. Strong performance, high quality blend. Better than SNOI to my nose. Wore it to office, got compliments. Will be getting the full bottle.

Armaf CDNUME - 8.5/10
Aventus + Sauvage mashup. Fresh, mass appealing, floral Sauvage twist. Good pick if you’re bored of the typical sauvage profile. Great performance and is a pretty versatile fragrance too. 

Armaf CDN Iconic - 9/10
Best BDC clone I’ve tried. A touch more of incense feel with this one compared to the OG, stronger performance. Pricey but worth it.

Maison Alhambra Dark Door Sport - 5.5/10
Rich scent, accurate clone to Dior Homme Sport but terrible longevity (3–4 hrs). Only get it if you’re okay with reapplying frequently. 

Maison Alhambra Yeah! EDP - 5/10
Closer to YSL Y compared to Fakhar but weird opening and weak performance. Prefer Fakhar.

Lattafa Oud for Glory - 6.5/10
Not heavy on oud. Rich, masculine, patchouli-forward. Good longevity.

Lattafa Asad - 7/10
Warm, spicy-ambery, not as refined but close to Sauvage. Great pricing. Great performance. Get it if you want Sauvage at a fraction of the price. 

Afnan 9PM Dive - 4/10
Fresh opening but quickly turns into Axe body spray vibes. Pass.",8,1756028531.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,7,0.9,False

1myr4g5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1myr4g5/my_girlfriend_wont_stop_stealing_my_yawnees/,My Girlfriend Won't Stop Stealing My Yawnees,"
My girlfriend Jamie and I have been living together for three months now. By all accounts we’re a perfectly normal couple. We met on Tinder about half a year ago, and we bonded over the fact that we’re both accountants. I noticed QuickBooks in the background of one of her pictures and made some cheesy joke about wanting to know the *ledger* of her personality.



We went on a date, one thing led to another, and we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend within a month. When the lease on her studio apartment came to an end a few weeks later, she said that she wanted to come live with me. I was hesitant. I thought about my parents’ disdain for my cousin who moved in with her boyfriend before marriage. It took them over a year to start talking to her again.



When I confided in Jamie, she went on this long passionate rant. We were meant to be together; we couldn’t let what other people thought stop us. “I love you,” she said for the very first time.



Seeing how passionate she was made me *sure* that she was the one for me. I was excited about the idea of being star-crossed lovers, though my family still doesn’t know that we’re living together.



The move in was easy. She threw away or donated most of her belongings, and she didn’t bring any pictures or decorations. Just the clothes on her back and some more in a duffle bag.



The first month was amazing. We ate breakfast every morning and slept cuddled up every night. I was so happy. It’s always been hard for me to find someone I enjoy sharing my space with, and the fact that I could be with her for hours and hours and never get bored was amazing.



We were watching a movie one night. Jamie was cuddled up against my shoulder, and I was getting pretty tired. As I began to yawn, she leaned her head around so that our noses were touching, and opened her mouth wide.



She made a sucking sound like someone slurping a straw. It continued until my mouth was closed. 



“I stole your yawnee!” she said, then scooted back to my side.



I just stared. It was so shocking coming from her. I can probably count on one hand the amount of times she’s ever made a joke. I mean, this was the type of girl who emailed me calendar invites for date nights; sometimes she started her text messages with “Hello, Robert.”



It was so out of the blue, but I was happy to see that she was getting comfortable enough to show me her silly side. I laughed and we continued watching the movie. 



Over the next few weeks she “stole my yawnee” every so often. Maybe a few times a week, and never more than once or twice in a day.But over time it started to lose its cuteness. Even if it’s your girlfriend, it’s kinda gross to have someone suck up your yawn. When the novelty wears off, it’s not much different than sucking up a burp. But maybe I was just in a bad mood around that time. For whatever reason I was starting to have trouble sleeping, and I was making too many stupid mistakes at work. One day my boss stepped into my office and closed the door behind him. 



“Your performance is going to need to improve,” he said. “You used to be one of my top guys. Recently…” he paused, looking around the room as if searching for the right words. “It’s hard to say if you’re worth keeping around.”



That night she did it twice. The second was after I’d heard her snoring. I screamed so loud I’m surprised our neighbors didn’t wake up. 



Every time she did it I got a little more uncomfortable, but it was the one joke she had, and I’m sure she believed I thought it was hilarious. I didn’t want to dissuade her from being silly with me, but I was still in the process of working up the confidence to tell her that I wanted her to stop when we got into a bit of a disagreement one Friday night.



I had made reservations weeks in advance for a dinner to celebrate our monthly anniversary. She waited until an hour before we were supposed to leave to tell me that she was too tired to go.



I told her that was fine, but I’m sure she could tell from the annoyance in my voice that I was pissed. I mean, if you have an event planned weeks in advance, especially something like a dinner with your significant other, you think you’d be ready, right? Go to bed a little earlier the night before, grab a coffee or an energy drink. At the very least, she could tough it out for a couple hours to make me happy, right? 



“I just haven’t been getting enough yawnees recently,” she said.



I about lost my mind. “Can you cut it out with the crap?” I said. “It’s weird and disgusting. I just wanted to celebrate with you. Can’t we just try to have a good night?” 



She didn’t respond; she just stared at me with her eyes narrowed and her head tilted to the side. It was the look of someone who was about to lose it. I had opened my mouth to continue but faltered. Had I really made her that mad?



I went to our room and got in bed. I was too angry to sleep, but too tired to do anything else. I was laying there, thinking about all the things I might say to her, when I heard the door creak.



But no one was there. It must have been the wind or something. I hadn’t closed the door anyway, and I couldn’t tell whether or not it was more open than it was a few moments prior. I turned to face the wall and tried my best to fall asleep before she came to bed. As petty as it sounds, I was determined not to speak to her again for the rest of the night. 



After a few moments, I felt pressure in the back of my throat, then air filling up in my ears as my jaw began to tingle. I opened my mouth, right at the faint beginning of an inhale, Jamie slid out from under the bed, swiftly shifted to a sitting position, and put her mouth up against mine, sucking the remnants of a yawn halted by a scream out of my throat.



“What the fuck?!” I pushed myself to the middle of the bed.



“I got your yawnee!” She said, smiling.



“This is fucking insane!” I screamed. “What is wrong with you?”



I was seething with rage. I gripped the comforter with both hands so hard that my nails dug into my palms through the fabric. Jamie ignored me; she got into her side of the bed and was sleeping shortly after. I barely closed my eyes for the rest of the night.



We ignored each other over the weekend, and I made sure to hide my yawns as much as I was able. On Sunday, after walking into the bathroom and locking the door just to keep my yawn to myself, I looked at myself in the mirror. I hadn’t showered since Friday morning, and I’d only slept a couple hours since then. My hair was a greasy mess. There were thick, purple bags under my eyes.



I couldn’t shake the feeling that she was going to steal another yawn right when I least expected it. I didn’t want to let that happen, but at the same time, how could I be so ridiculous? Did it really matter?



My mistakes at work continued, and on Wednesday my boss put me on probation. Two days later, Jamie came home and told me that she’d won employee of the month. It came with a $2,000 bonus.



I was happy for her, and I took her out to dinner and a movie to celebrate. She laughed at all my cheesy jokes, and it felt like we were in the first month of our relationship again. It felt good to be on decent terms with her again. Was it really worth sacrificing my sleep, our relationship, and my job because I was scared she was going to steal my yawn?



When we got home we sat down on the couch to watch a movie. She snuggled up against me. “Robert,” she said, then paused for a moment. “I… I love you.”



“I love you too.”



It felt like she was building up to an apology but never quite got there. She’s always been an awkward person. It made sense that she was too embarrassed to admit that she took the joke too far. I could tell by the way she smiled at me that she felt horrible. But… I still wasn’t sure. The only way to be sure, to bring things back to normal, was to yawn in front of her. Once I was certain that she wasn’t going to steal my yawn, I could relax; I could sleep; I could trust her again. I know it seems silly, but I felt like this was what I needed to get my life back.



I opened my mouth and let out a loud yawn.



She slipped out from under my arm, enveloped my mouth with hers, and sucked it out of me like a hungry snake.



“I got your yawnee!” she squealed. She smiled at me, looking directly into my eyes from only a few inches away, then sat back against the couch and leaned her head against my shoulder.



For a moment the world seemed frozen. The movie was muffled; I could no longer feel Jamie on my side. Was this a dream? 



I closed my eyes and began counting to 10. Halfway through I realized that I’d been holding my breath. When I opened my eyes I jerked away from her and went to bed.



I laid there thinking about our relationship and how to get out of it. We had just renewed a 13-month lease together. And how could I explain to anyone that I was leaving her because she wouldn’t stop stealing my yawns? 



When she got into bed I locked myself in the guest bathroom and cried. I spent the night in the tub with a bath towel. I’m not sure if I ever fell asleep, but it couldn’t have been for more than two or three hours. 



I waited until I heard Jamie leave to unlock the door. I was twenty minutes late to work. That was strike one for the day.



Strike two was when my boss surprised me in my office and I spilled my cup of coffee all over his new suit.



“Jesus Christ!” He screamed and jumped backwards, slamming against my desk and sending my lamp to the floor. He reached toward his suit to wipe the scalding hot coffee off his hands, then thought better and started wiping them off on my desk. “This is a $4,000 suit,” he continued. “What the fuck is your problem?” He stuck the side of his thumb in his mouth as he left the room.



I tried to stay on my A-game for the rest of the day. I didn’t leave my office again except to go to the bathroom. Even then, I first peeked my head around my office door like a sly criminal to make sure the coast was clear.



Things were going better until about 3:00 PM, but I’m still not sure exactly what happened. I was doing some mundane task, inputting invoice numbers or something, when suddenly someone was nudging me from behind.



I woke up with my head pressed against the keyboard and about a thousand w’s entered where a number was supposed to be.



“Strike three,” my boss said. “Get your stuff and get out of here.”



When I got home I paced the living room, waiting for Jamie. 6:00 PM came, 30 minutes late. 6:05… I was just about to call her when she walked through the door carrying a bottle of wine. She was smiling wide and practically jumping up and down. I swear I’d never seen her so happy.



“I got promoted to team lead!” she said.



“How much is the raise?” I asked. I couldn’t look at her.



“It’s an extra $20,000 a year!



“Then we’re only down about 30.”



“What do you mean?” She asked.



I told her everything, and by the end of it I was crying in her arms. I was so comforted by the way she held me. She made me feel that everything was going to be okay. I cried until I had nothing left to give. 



“I’m just so tired,” I said, pleading as if she could fix me.



“I know,” she said. “I know. Just relax and let it happen.”



My eyes closed; a warm sensation ran through my body. Jamie patted my back as my mouth opened reflexively.



And then the disgusting, slurping sound. Droplets of spit flying from her mouth into mine. I didn’t fight it. Just cried and let myself fall further against her.



“It’s okay baby,” she said. “I’ll take care of you.” She kissed me on my forehead. “As long as you keep letting me have your yawnees.”



We fell asleep on the couch together. In the morning she went to work and I stayed home feeling sorry for myself. As the hours went by and I did nothing except scroll Instagram on my phone, I felt more and more of the realization that Jamie now owned me. I might as well have been a puppy in a kennel.



She would come home from work every day ready to take my yawns. Although I thought I’d have more energy now that I didn’t have to work, I found myself to be more tired than ever. When she was gone, all I could do was lay in bed, on the couch, or in the bath. When she got home she’d take a yawn, cook dinner, then take one more before bed. It became a Pavlovian response for me. When she walked toward me I would tingle, and when she opened her mouth in front of mine I’d give in instantaneously.



As the days went on I became worse, and time started to warp in odd ways. One moment we’d be eating dinner, the next she’d be coming home from work. One night, we went to bed watching our favorite show,  and when I woke up I was at the kitchen table with a half-eaten waffle in front of me. I dropped the fork I’d been holding and screamed.



“What’s wrong?” Jamie asked. She looked at me with her head tilted to the side. It would have been genuine concern if it wasn’t for the slight smile.



The more I thought about it the more I could faintly remember Jamie nudging me awake and leading me to the kitchen table. “I… I must have zoned out.”



I looked up and was surprised to see her wearing a robe. “Aren’t you supposed to be at work?”



“It’s Saturday, honey. Now give me a yawnee.”



She sucked it out of my mouth, but I barely noticed; I was thinking about something else. 



How could it be Saturday when we’d fallen asleep watching our show? The one that played on Monday nights.



As if my noticing flipped an invisible switch, it only got worse. One day it was nearly 100 degrees outside, the next it was snowing. I checked my phone one evening to see a text from my mom.



*I can’t believe you missed the funeral.*



There was beating in my throat. My body tingled in a strange, unpleasant way; I scrolled through the rest of our messages. Most recent were several texts all asking where I was. One telling me she hated me, one telling me she loved me.



I found a long paragraph that I’d written. It was about my dad and a memory of us fishing; one message from my mom said that she didn’t know how to move on without him. 



I couldn’t breathe. I got up out of bed, watched my feet as I walked toward the kitchen. The carpet turned to wood, then there was a dirty rug I didn’t recognize. I tried to kick it; instead I tripped and fell.



“What are you doing on the floor, honey?” Jamie asked, as if she hadn’t seen me.



“My dad… why, why wasn’t I at the funeral?”



“Don’t you remember, honey? You had to stay home and give me your yawnees. Like you promised.” 



She looked back down at her notebook and continued to write by hand, humming something I didn’t recognize.



I stood up and turned in a circle. Looking, looking, looking. My eyes found something sharp. A beautiful knife with a pink blade. I don’t remember what I did, but I remember that it felt good.



I haven’t slept since then, but I have more energy than ever. I don’t know what will happen next, but I do know one thing.

I woke up feeling strange today. Nothing seemed familiar. The walls of my room looked slightly off, the colors muted in ways I couldn’t explain. I tried to shake it, but (LOOK) closer.

I went to the kitchen for coffee, but the routine felt alien. My hands shook as I poured, and I noticed odd marks on the counter I didn’t recognize. It made me pause. (LISTEN HARDER.)

At work, I couldn’t focus. I wrote reports, but some pages seemed wrong when I reread them. Words I didn’t remember writing stared back at me. (TRY TO REMEMBER.)

During lunch, I checked my phone. Messages I thought I’d sent sounded unfamiliar, almost like someone else was trying to reach me. (WRITE EVERYTHING DOWN.)

By evening, I wandered through the streets near my apartment. I couldn’t recognize any landmarks. The city seemed empty, yet there were traces of someone else’s life here… mine, but not mine. (WHERE AM I ?)

I sat on a bench, trying to make sense of the day. Reflections in shop windows showed me a face I knew, yet it wasn’t me. (WHO AM I ?)

I feel myself slipping between memories and moments I can’t control. (PLEASE HELP ME) I don’t know how long I can hold on. Everything is fracturing. (SAVE ME)",6,1756027713.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I was born 2. My mother and father were having a difficult time 3. My mother cheated on my father 4. My father decided that I wasn't his child and he said that my mother had definitely cheated on him before but also decided to stay with my mother 5. For years, my father actively reminded me at every step that I wasn't his child and isolated me from his side of the family 6. It turned out that I was his biological child 7. My mother and father were having   problems again, this time it turned out that my father was the cheater 8. They got divorced.



I am currently 25 years old, and when I was 18 I almost completely cut myself off from my father and his side of the family. Technically, it was 50/50 custody, but since I was legally an adult in our country, I no longer had to spend time with him. However, he still had to pay child support because I was still in school.



Recently, my father started trying to contact me. It literally came out of nowhere. Phone calls, showing up at work, invitations to various celebrations, etc. I tried to report it to the police several times, but the answers I got were basically ""he's your father, you can handle it yourself"" or ""technically he's not hurting you, so we won't do anything.""



Recently, I finally broke down and agreed to talk to him, but only in a public place. We met at a coffee shop. My father... tried to convince me to live with him and his new family (wife + two children) and claimed that he ""found a way to free me from my mother"" and that he ""wanted to repair our bond and make up for all those years."". I said him no and that I love my mother and I have no plans to abandon her. 



He looked like he didn't understand it at all. He started reminding me that she had betrayed him first, that she had destroyed our family, and so on. I told him what I'd always thought: my mother had destroyed their relationship, but he had destroyed my life and made my childhood terrible. He actively manipulated his side of the family and always made me feel like I'm the enemy. I told him that I still remember all the family holidays where I either didn't get presents because I wasn't ""family"" or I got the bare minimum. Or a vacation I wasn't invited to. His family never apologized. He never apologized. My mother also needed time to get out of that relationship, but at least she went to therapy, reconnected with her parents, and when I was a teenager, she actively fought for our relationship. She helped me, apologized, listened to my interests, got to know my friends, she returned to work after many years just to finally us be free from him.  etc., while he sulked even after it turned out I was his daughter.



My father did not take this well and practically started screaming that ""she cheated on first!"" or he even went so far as to say that my mother was deliberately isolating me from him. I told him again that wasn't true. It was my decision. I didn't want to see him, and when I legally no longer had to, I cut him off. I told him I hate him. 





He started screaming again and I ended up asking a  waitress to help me out (and  I'm really gratefulbecause she was wonderful and composed while I was panicking).



Honestly, I didn't think I was an asshole, but when I got home I told my boyfriend, who also has divorced parents and a tough family situation, about this and.... he wasn't on my side. He wasn't 100% on my father's side either, but I could see he was trying to put the blame 50/50.  He told me that my father shouldn't be aggressive, but he saw where his anger was coming from and that it was a bit strange of me to defend my mother when she also deserved criticism. I was in shock (and tired). I couldn't form a response, so we ended up changing the subject, but now I can't stop thinking about his words.

**The Verdict:**  
Alejandro Davidovich Fokina is the tennis equivalent of a Roomba on a coffee high: relentless, unshakable, and *very* likely to vacuum up this match. The odds? Fokina is priced at **1.16-1.18** (implied probability: **51-53%**) across bookmakers, while Alexander Shevchenko sits at **4.8-5.43** (17-20%). Translation: Fokina is the statistical favorite to win this like it’s a Tuesday.

**Why Fokina?**  
Analysts have already called this a “Davidovich Fokina in 4” consensus, and the numbers back it. His spread is **-6.5 to -7.5 games**, meaning even the most charitable bettor would expect him to dominate by double digits. The total games line hovers around **32.5-33.5**, with even

-moving soon, hoping to find a place where i can have a dedicated office space that’s Only for work

-dedicated work music (i can’t do music w words while im focusing so i’ve always listened to lofi beats, recs welcome tho!)

-weekly check ins with my supervisor for accountability/support

-pomodoro (this helped me Sometimes in school but idk how well it’d translate to wfh??)

-task transition rituals to help my brain differentiate btwn Work time and Free time

I’ve recently broke up with someone I truly loved and I feel so empty and I really don’t know what to do apart from try and read something to distract my mind 

However I am a bit picky about the ship and the AU and character dynamics though. Theres one specific ship I’m currently obsessed with so I’m looking for a fanfic to read and then rewrite with the ship I’m obsessed with.

I (24F) have a crush on this guy (28M). We met on Instagram through a uni group chat (we don’t go to the same university).
Right now, things between us are very casual and there are no romantic vibes yet. We reply to each other’s Instagram stories every few days, and recently we had our longest conversation ever (which made me sooo excited 😅)
Here’s my dilemma: I like him, but we’ve never met in person. I’m wondering if I should just wait for him to suggest meeting up or if it’s okay for me to ask him something casual like “Do you want to grab coffee or watch a movie this weekend?” I don’t want it to feel awkward or make things weird between us.

Brazil approached the global trade body in early August after President Donald Trump raised duties on more than a third of US-bound exports from the Latin American powerhouse, including key items like coffee, beef and sugar.

Trump hit Brazil with some of his highest tariff rates as punishment for what he calls a ""witch hunt"" against his ally, former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro, who is on trial for allegedly plotting to attempt a coup.

""The United States accepts the request of Brazil to enter into consultations,"" read a letter dated August 15 from the Washington WTO delegation and published on the organization's website.

""We stand ready to confer with officials from your mission on a mutually convenient date for consultations,"" it continued.

The US letter cautioned that some of the issues raised by Brazil ""are issues of national security not susceptible to review or capable of resolution by WTO dispute settlement.""

The WTO consultation process involves seeking a negotiated solution before moving into arbitration.

Trump's tariff order also charged that the Brazilian government's recent policies and actions threatened the US economy, national security, and foreign policy.

Unlike most countries targeted by Washington's reciprocal tariffs, the United States runs a trade surplus with Brazil, not a deficit.",1,1756026704.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

The location has strong pull factors — Mt. Banahaw view, Kamay ni Hesus, the Pahiyas Festival, and the steady stream of tourist,balikbayans and business travelers.

The concept I’m exploring is a 2–3 floor hotel designed as:

Ground floor → coffee shop + resto + function/conference hall

Second & third floors → hotel/lodging units (number of rooms scale with funding)

To make the funding model secure and transparent, I’m considering a co-ownership structure:

✅ 2.5M per co-owner

✅ Each co-owner gets a 100 sqm titled lot (separate from the hotel property)

This means each co-owner holds a tangible and appreciating asset from day one

✅ Equal profit sharing for 10 years (extendable)

✅Complete notarized agreement 

Note: Several celebrities have also purchased property in Lucban, which supports the strong investment atmosphere in the area

The idea is to create a professional but welcoming space — a hotel that serves both tourists and events (weddings, conferences, retreats). With Lucban’s rising visibility, the timing looks promising.

I’d like to hear outside perspectives on this kind of co-ownership setup.

u/Aztec111 = thank you for the picturesque card and the cool stickers as well! I hope that you can visit my home country sometime in the near future too.

u/withininus = thank you for the beautiful card, I thought the embossed flower on the front gave the card so much elegance! I absolutely love it :) Also, thanks for including that quote from Sense & Sensibility, now I have to return the favour and tell you one of my favourite quotes that I have read = ""It may be normal, darling; but I'd rather be natural"" - Breakfast at Tiffany's. 

Also, thank you for the Dior postcard, it was a pleasure making the card and RAOC offers!

u/awriterpossibly = thank you for answering the prompt (it was ""what's your weakest claim to fame?""), it was an absolute pleasure to hear about the vast variety of stories you have about your encounters with celebrities!

u/DiviningMermaid = thank you for the postcard. I loved the little tidbits that you stuck on the postcard as well, like the message ""believe in yourself"", it makes it all the more special!

u/Yzmxtc = thank you for the card and bits of happy mail that went with it. Your card found me in good health and high spirits! There was no pressure to send anything to me, but please know that it was greatly appreciated :)

Also, thank you for the cappuccino postcard. As a coffee lover (and maybe caffeine addict, lol!), I love it :)

u/RigelThief = (I think this is the right username?) thank you for the postcard of Muroji Temple in Nara, Japan!

u/GoldenGioGio = thank you for the postcards, and apologies for not getting back to you sooner! I adore  both of the postcards that you have sent me, and I can't wait for the  many future exchanges that we will have :)

u/Boomerang88 = thank you for the postcard, it was a wonderful surprise! Don't worry, I had a look through my Google Forms, and you signed up for a Nottinghill Bookshop-inspired Greeting card from Fionn McCool (the cover is the same as the cover of a Penguin Classic book).

u/birdiebennett = thank you for the lovely happy mail and the greeting cards. And from a scaredy-cat like myself, I completely understand what you mean about the anxiety that people have during thrillers and horror books or movies :)

u/Internet_Creep_SM = thank you for the stickers and other awesome bits and bobs that you put in the envelope.

I am sorry in advance if it's already asked again and answered.

I have lost 22lbs (10kg) during this time and when from 189,5bs (86kg) to 165lbs (75kg). I am very satisfied with that. But I do not know if I am burning away at fat or muscle.

My main problem is that every time I test for ketosis using blood tests keto mojo , I am not in ketosis. I am always at around 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3mmol/L and blood glucose is always (exept after eating, waking up or exercise, due to insuline/adrenaline) at 85-95mg/DL(even after fasting for 24 hours!! 
The highest GKI score I have achieved is 25, which is not considered ketosis.

I think my body is more adapted to protein and gluconeogenesis than it is at ketosis. And my fear is, Ok I ll lose weight and my body will get toned and slimmer but I won't get any of the health benefits of keto.

Here is where I am asking for your help. 

What made you get into ketosis? I only eat eggs and meat and a bit of lettuce salad for the fiber. I ve even tried MCT oil and bulletproof coffee to jump start it. 

Carbs practically non existent to <10g total. I am intermedent fasting and 5/2 with 2 days per week doing a 24h fast and this I think is the main reason I am shedding weight.

Long story short, I’m 23, I earn 33k (soon to go to 41k), I have no savings AND I’m in 18k of debt. Yep, wtf?! I’ve been in debt since I went to university at 18. It was incredibly manageable with just an overdraft but when I was 20 living with my boyfriend, he had lost his job. That is when I had the bright idea to get credit cards. I’m sure you can picture how that’s gone. 

I have a plan to be debt free by around December next year. Absolutely feels like a lifetime away but I know it will fly by. My biggest worry is have no savings. My debt plans do not account for any money aside. I know that this is incredibly risky but right now I’m trying to manage the sheer amount of different debts I have which will significantly reduce my monthly minimums but might help stimulate my mind. I also don’t want to increase how long it is going to take me either. 

Here’s a bit of an overview of the plan: 
Clear one-off payments (Klarna etc)
Pay my computer fully off (frees 71.55 a month)
Pay off a smallish loan (frees 52.50 a month and will get rid of the interest adding each month) 
Pay off my Overdraft
Pay off my Vanquis card - highest interest card and it’s about 5500 at the moment. Until I can aggressively pay I’m doing minimum + interest 
Pay off my Barclay Card - again, minimum + interest until I can aggressively pay into it. At this point I can throw in around 1.4k with other debts cleared. 
Then finally pay off my final loan - this one I have to pay the full amount + fees. I can’t pay extra each month which sucks. 

I understand that this way I will pay a bit more in interest than if I tackled the credit cards first, but by the time I’ve paid the other bits off first I can throw in 1-1.4k each month and the reward of them going will just be amazing. With my cards as well I physically can’t spend on these anymore. My boyfriend has them and I deleted my app and froze the cards so don’t worry about me spending because I genuinely can’t. 

Should I try to make room for savings? So far I’m giving myself £150 for “fun” money, including lashes, books and then if I’m going for a coffee with my boyfriend. I know that I realistically won’t spend this much a month but just covers if I have plans with family which doesn’t pop up often but could do. With the leftovers each month instead of rolling it over in the fun money pot, should I just add it to a rainy day fund incase a small emergency pops up? I don’t own a car and I rent a flat. We do have pets but my boyfriend has said he will cover vet bills while my focus is this. 

I am absolutely open to advice on my plan and also anything that can motivate me mentally to stick to this! ",6,1756025288.0,UKPersonalFinance,18,0.81,False

3 days 

At the same shabby café



Experiment

The place is tired 

Old

Decaying

An accident that still happens 



I told myself I needed a reality check

The mirror at home is sometimes not enough

And this pile of pretentious concrete

It is capable of dissecting your last entrails



The coffee grounds

The frozen smell

Railings made of stiff necks

Market monotony sold by the cup

  
Ugly are the eyes

That skip their own reflections

1myqelq,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1myqelq/my_30m_fiancee_28f_doesnt_have_hobbies_and_its/,My [30M] Fiancee [28F] doesn't have hobbies and it's creating issues in our relationship.,"My fiancee doesn't have any hobbies. When I ask her what she likes, she doesn't know. She has friends that she sees maybe every 2nd weekend, or she'll see 1-2 of them during the week or whatever but it's just for coffees or maybe a drink or two. As a result, she is, at least from my perspective, super burned out.

She's a bright and happy person generally but she is SUCH a worrier that it takes a toll on her health. She wakes up in the night with bad dreams and worries over the tiniest things in life that may or may not ever happen. 

The interests she has all stem from what her parents encouraged her to do as a kid. She followed their guidance in choosing a career which present day she has no interest in, and all of her ex-hobbies were her father's hobbies that she was led into. As an example, her dad loves golf, so now she watches golf 1-2 times per year, owns golf clubs, but never even goes to a driving range. It's like a placeholder hobby.

Her body is in constant fight or flight mode. If she gets a moment to sit down she passes out like she has narcolepsy. She is EXHAUSTED. To the degree that on a Friday night she falls asleep on the sofa at 9PM and on the weekends she naps the afternoons away.

In my opinion, the exhaustion is because she doesn't know how to relax. Ever. When she comes home, she goes right into chores. When the chores are done, she showers. When she's done taking care of her hygiene and stuff, she might have 1-2 hours before she falls asleep but if that time is empty space, she'll call home or find some sort of project to work on - or worse, doomscroll Instagram.

As a caring partner I've tried to encourage her to take more time for herself. Spend some time alone watching a new movie, play her piano or guitar, go to the golfing range, play video games, meet friends, whatever. I just want her to stop feeling dread and guilt for napping or for taking time to take care of herself.

It's gotten to the point where she not only feels guilty for napping and wasting her own time, but now she feels guilty and apologizes to me for napping. If I enter the room and catch her doomscrolling she'll apologize for it. I'm starting to feel like a micromanager, like I'm looking after a child. 

I genuinely can't figure her out. I've never known someone refuse to relax like she does. When we met, we met abroad and bonded over travelling and living in a country with a relaxed outlook on life. Now we're living in a different country and we've settled into a normal daily life and I've discovered that this is how she lives. 

Her mom is very similar, and has worried herself into a nervous wreck as she gets older. She suffers with tremors because of anxiety. I don't want to see my partner go down the same path.

Has anyone experience anything similar and can offer any advice?

  
tl;dr: fiancee is suffering from what is probably undiagnosed anxiety and has no idea how to relax. How do I help her?

1myqe36,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhR4Dating/comments/1myqe36/29_m4f_hiking_and_running_dates_quezon_city/,29 [M4F] Hiking and Running Dates - Quezon City,"You may have come across this post before—it’s definitely a repost. I haven’t found the right person yet, so I’m giving it another try. Perhaps this time, the right eyes will land on it.

Anyways, here’s the story:

Once upon a time, there was a tall, nerd, and not-much attractive guy *pero pwede na* who woke up one morning, looked at the sky, and thought, ""Well, this sucks."" He knew there was only one solution - to turn to the all-knowing oracle of modern dating: T̶i̶n̶d̶e̶r̶ Reddit lol.

With his trusty cup of sea salt coffee in hand, he set out to find someone who shared his thirst for knowledge, someone who could keep up with his quirks, and someone who he could eventually take on 'friendly' and ‘wholesome’ dates (whatever that means). He wasn't in a rush to jump into anything too serious too soon, but he knew that someday, he wanted to find someone he could build a meaningful and caring partnership.

So if you're a fellow lover of specialty coffee, learning, and all things nerdy, this tall drink of water might just be the partner in crime you've been looking for. Dating at times feel like a job hunt doesn't it? You either get guys who sends nsfw stuff right away or you get a friendly ones so I thought it’d be fun to write it in a mock format just like a resume! LOL

##About me

An old soul as older people I spoke with would say, into small business and investments, 2nd year law student (took a LOA atm), can drive a fucking 10 wheeler truck lol (/s towards people looking for someone with wheels), no ex-cheating issues or sabit, can provide a certificate of no jowa (kahit wala naman talagang ganon haha). Last relationship (6 years) was 3 years ago and dated someone last year but didn’t worked out.

- I'm 5'9"", physically fit and active, resides near in QC. I would say that average level attractive yet clean and very hygienic.

- I'm an INTJ-T, Aries, if you’re into MBTI or if you believe that people only have 12 personalities.

- Loves to read history and self-help books not because I’m smart rich but I believe about continous learning and motivate myself along the way.

-  I'm the kind of person who doesn't follow the herd blindly, even if it means standing alone in a field of conformity. My principles are like a compass, always pointing me in the right direction, even if it's not the most popular route. In short, I'm not afraid to swim against the current, as long as it's in line with my beliefs.

-  You could say that my communication style is like a triple-layered cake: serious, meaningful, and sprinkled with a healthy dose of humor. Sure, I may come off as really awkward at times, but that's just my way of keeping things interesting. After all, who wants a bland and flavorless conversation when you can have a deliciously complex one? So, if you're looking for someone who can engage in a thoughtful discussion, crack a few jokes, and still leave you with something to ponder, then look no further.

- I'm what you might call a clean freak with a creative streak. As someone who's a bit OC (okay, maybe more than a bit), I can't stand to see a messy or cluttered home. But don't worry, I'm not the type to wait around for someone else to do the dirty work. I take pride in noticing when something needs to be done and taking care of it without being asked - it's like a satisfying little victory every time. And when it comes to interior design and home decor, I'm practically a pro. I'm always on the hunt for the latest and greatest tools and gadgets to keep things looking fresh and stylish. So if you're looking for someone to spruce up your space and keep things sparkling clean, I'm your go-to guy.

- I'm not in the business of putting people down - unless we're talking about the volume on the stereo (badum-tss!). But seriously, I believe in treating others with kindness and respect, even when it's not the easiest thing to do. After all, life is hard enough without having to deal with someone else's negativity. So let's lift each other up instead of tearing each other down, shall we?

- I set long-term feasible goals and actively pursue them.

##Here's a list of my favorites:
Movies/Series | Music | Places | Activities | Books
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
Godfather | Radiohead | Paris | Cycling | The Daily Stoic by Ryan Holiday
Sherlock | Eraserheads | Coffee Shops | Painting | How to Win Friends & Influence People
Castaway | Nirvana  | Cebu | Muay Thai | Meditation s by Marcus Aurelius
Forrest Gump | Ebe Dancel | Japan | Scuba/Freediving | Start with Why by Simon Sinek

##Pros:

- Respoņsible (Good credit score, no debts, no criminal records, and self-reliant)

- Curious type of person, who's ready to listen and craves to learn a lot of things

- Doesn't do drugs and is not a heavy drinker/alcoholic.

- Respects your views and accept healthy criticism. Respects personal space and time

- Actually appreciating the things you'll do for me, and showing it. If you cooked a big dinner, saying thank you is nice. Doing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen is even nicer, and in my opinion, should be the norm. The cook doesn't clean. If someone does something for me, I'll show them that their effort was appreciated instead of just accepting their generosity and then running off back to whatever I'm doing.

- Accepts respònsibility or has accountability for one's own action and does not try to blame everything or everyone else. 

- No addiction/s, drugs, tattoos and not into online games

##My preference:

- Someone who has a strong passion for accurate and comprehensive learning, maintains a normal BMI, physically active as well and is beautiful and easy on the eyes - I believe that beauty comes in all shapes and sizes (no offense intended towards plus-size women!).

- Has high moral standards for what she wants and is not afraid to communicate it.

- Craves knowledge as well. Love and isn't afraid to try new things and adventures.

- Passionate and proud about something they've been working on/have done/are planning to do

- Confident about what they want but isn't in-your-face about it.

—and ideally, someone who enjoys staying active too, so we can share more than just deep conversations—maybe runs, hikes, or muay thai sessions together. Shared passions make connections even stronger.

Let's take a break from stressing over the mundane and focus on the important stuff - like what will make us happy for the rest of our lives! Share your thoughtys on how we can achieve that and let's get this happiness train moving! Send me your pic and I'll send mine!

It lets them save, transact, and send remittances without banks siphoning off fees or governments freezing funds. Layer-2 solutions and stablecoins are tackling volatility and scalability, making day-to-day payments more practical. Imagine streaming micropayments for content, frictionless global trade, or instant payroll in any part of the world. Crypto may not dominate your local coffee shop yet, but dismissing it as “not money” is like dismissing the internet in 1995 as “not media.” The infrastructure is being built and, when it matures, crypto could be the most efficient and universal currency humanity has ever seen.

However, on the Capitalisn’t podcast, Luigi Zingales (Nobel Prize in Econimics) said:

“I think that the problem with all the cryptos is that in order to create some trust in the system, you basically bound the supply. Once you bound the supply, the price is driven entirely by demand. To the extent that demand is fluctuating, prices fluctuate crazily. Because they fluctuate crazily, nobody is going to use it as a currency. That’s the reason why the movement now, especially with Bitcoin, says, ‘Oh, it’s not a currency. It’s an asset.

The problem is, I’m not attracted to him. I’m really frustrated with myself because I feel so shallow—on paper, he checks all of my boxes even the most minute/trivial characteristics about him fits what I want out of a partner to a T.

He has a great job at a top company, shares similar morals and goals, we work in related industries and can relate to one another, we enjoy the same things, and our upbringings were quite similar. On paper too I’d say we’re pretty compatible.

He always makes an effort to plan our dates and works around my schedule, even though he’s probably even busier than I am. Since we started seeing each other, he’s mentioned going to the gym more because he’s been inspired by how often I go and he’s really working on himself. I am also trying to make an effort to see him because he’s genuinely a good guy — I’ll drive like 40 minutes to go on dates and even try to fit a quick coffee run during a work day to be with him.

He’s not unattractive — he’s 6 feet tall and Wasian, which is usually my type. We have amazing conversations, and he’s genuinely fun to be around. But I’m just not attracted to him.

I originally posted this two months ago but updated because he kissed me tonight and I thought it wasn’t bad but also just wasn’t good… I figured once he finally kissed me it would change how I felt about him.

At first, I was reading on my phone, but then I decided to really invest in the hobby and finally bought an e-reader — the Kindle Basic 2024. I’ve been eyeing Kindles for years, even during my slump, so this was a big deal for me.

Honestly, I love it. It’s compact, fits in all my bags, and really meets my needs. I work 8–5 at the office, spend a lot of weekends outside the house (coffee shops, random spots), and I always bring my Kindle with me. I don’t usually go to the beach, but even when I do, I don’t bring it near the water, so waterproofing isn’t really a must.

I also don’t mind the lack of warm light — I use my own reading light at home which gives the same effect. The size is great for portability and even commuting. It doesn’t feel awkward to whip out, unlike a big “tablet.”

But… there’s this itch in me to buy a Paperwhite 6 (secondhand from FB Marketplace). The main reason is that it’s bigger — and I usually lean toward bigger versions of gadgets. That said, I don’t actually have any issues reading on the Basic and I genuinely enjoy the portability.

So, what do you think? Should I give in and upgrade to a Paperwhite 6, or should I stick with my Basic 2024? If your answer is the latter, please de-influence me because the temptation is real. Bcos Im afraid that Ill regret buying the PPW6 and just end up using my Basic all the time. 🥹",1,1756024754.0,kindle,2,1.0,False

Honestly, I always thought those “work from anywhere” gigs were Insta scams or something… But nope! As of today, here are 10 companies legit hiring remote mobile app testers that are blowing my mind and re-wiring my career plans:

- ByteBuddies Inc.
- CloudCrush Labs
- NovaTrialz
- AppSprint Collective
- PixelPulse
- **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**
- TapTrackers
- Geekfinity Crew
- WizTest Solutions
- MagnaDev Co.

This list DROPPED and I’m still trying to process: since when did “test apps on your phone in pajamas & get paid” become a real thing?

I scrolled through **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** like three times because I assumed it was a weird puzzle or prank. Nope, all the proof is there. Real openings, salary ranges, app names to test, everything.

Couple things I legit had to re-read out of SHOCK:

- “100% Remote” (hasn’t that phrase gotten old AF? But I’m _not_ complaining.)
- Schedules are apparently *up to you*. 1am on a Tuesday? Sure, test the app & grab the bag.
- Some companies hand you free devices just to try their apps. Am I asleep???
- First requirement: own a smartphone. If this gig existed five years ago, my entire life would be changed.

Three days ago, I couldn’t even spell “QA engineer.” Now, I have the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** tab open 24/7.

I was also stunned that app testing is way more than “tap buttons and find bugs.” Sometimes, they literally want your “vibe check”—aka, “Does this app make you happy or sad?” Ummm, yes, I can do that! And they’ll PAY you for it?!

If you’re also shook and confused, here’s what I dug up about the companies:

- Onboarding training: a big thing now! Even beginners are fine.
- Pay is hourly OR per-feedback. Some peeps say they make $50 just for a 30-minute test sprint.
- Gen Z and Millennials are DOMINATING (I don’t know if I’m proud or threatened?).

My ONLY advice: stalk **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** because that’s apparently where these tester listings get posted the second they’re live. Set a reminder, because by the time you finish your coffee, these remote app gigs are GOOONE. 

Sorry, corporate office jobs—the future is apparently me, my sweatpants, my thumb, and the next viral dating app.

Here’s the **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** link again for the dangerously curious (don’t blame me if you go down this rabbit hole):

**https://goodnovel.org/testapp**

Would LOVE to hear if anyone else is as confused, hyped, or side-eyeing their full-time 9-to-5 right now? Who’s taking the leap? Is this the start of remote testing culture or am I getting ahead of myself?

I’ve been riding a high wave of excitement lately about something I once thought was only for hardcore coders: **No code Automation**! 🚀 Let’s be honest—there’s something magical about watching repetitive, soul-sapping tasks just *disappear* with a few clicks and some magical AI pixie dust.

Here’s why I can’t stop smiling about this no code revolution:

- **Drag, drop, automate, done.**
- *No more dreading the Monday-morning-data-dump.*
- Anyone—seriously, ANYONE—can set up an automation workflow now.

Just last week, I connected my Google Sheets to Slack, synced updates instantly with my team, and set reminders for deadlines—all without writing a single line of code. It almost felt like cheating (but in a “wow, the universe wants me to succeed!” kinda way 😂).

✨ Why this matters:
- No code automation is real empowerment. You don’t have to know Python or have a CompSci degree to build your dream workflow anymore!
- Efficiency doesn’t just belong to big, fancy corporations anymore. Small businesses and solo dreamers can now get their time back, too.
- Procrastination loses all its brilliant excuses: automate the boring stuff and focus on what matters most.

Some wins I’ve noticed:
- Reducing *copy-paste purgatory* to almost zero. No more ctrl+c, ctrl+v madness!
- Fewer mistakes since bots never have a bad day (or a coffee spill).
- Team morale is up because nobody’s stuck doing repetitive sludge-work.

Honestly, the biggest surprise? Sometimes these tools *think* of automating steps I didn’t even realize were possible.

Here are some wild workflow ideas I’ve seen float around (and tried!):
- New email → Auto add important data to CRM
- Incoming client form → Instantized Slack channel creation + welcome message
- Website feedback → Push straight to a “fix me ASAP” board

It’s like creativity unshackled.

I truly believe we’re at the start of a productivity groundswell. This is accessibility at its best—everyday creators directing digital “robots” to handle the grind.

So tell me:

- What small workflow would YOU automate if you could wave a magic wand?  
- What’s the simplest automation that’s completely flipped your daily game?

Drop your thoughts, no code dream features, and automagic wins below. Let’s spark some inspiration!

Happy building,

Tooth sensitivity can transform everyday activities like eating, drinking, and even breathing into painful experiences. Whether it's a sharp twinge when enjoying ice cream or a sudden ache when sipping hot coffee, dental sensitivity affects millions of people worldwide. Many individuals struggle with this uncomfortable condition, wondering why their teeth react so intensely to temperature changes, sweet foods, or even air. Understanding the root causes of tooth sensitivity is the first step toward finding effective relief and improving your overall oral health.

What Causes Tooth Sensitivity?

Tooth sensitivity occurs when the protective layers of your teeth become compromised, exposing the underlying nerve endings. Several factors can contribute to this painful condition:

1. Enamel Erosion
• Acidic foods and drinks
• Aggressive brushing
• Teeth grinding
• Age-related wear

2. Gum Recession
Gum recession exposes the tooth's root, which lacks the protective enamel covering. This exposure can lead to increased sensitivity and discomfort.

Common Triggers of Dental Sensitivity

Understanding the specific triggers can help you manage and reduce tooth sensitivity:

Thermal Sensitivity
Hot and cold temperatures can cause immediate pain in sensitive teeth. This occurs when temperature changes quickly stimulate the nerve endings in your dental tubules.

Statistical Insight: Approximately 40 million adults in the United States experience some form of tooth sensitivity.

Chemical Sensitivity
Acidic and sugary foods can cause sharp, sudden pain in sensitive teeth. The chemical composition of these foods interacts directly with exposed nerve endings.

Dental Conditions Contributing to Sensitivity

Several dental health issues can increase tooth sensitivity:

Tooth Decay
Cavities and dental decay can significantly reduce enamel protection, leading to increased sensitivity.

Cracked or Chipped Teeth
Structural damage to teeth exposes sensitive inner layers, causing immediate discomfort.

Dental Procedures
Recent dental work can temporarily increase tooth sensitivity as teeth heal and adjust.

Protecting your dental health can help reduce sensitivity:

Proper Brushing Techniques
• Use soft-bristled toothbrushes
• Brush gently in circular motions
• Avoid aggressive scrubbing

Dietary Recommendations
• Limit acidic foods and drinks
• Rinse mouth after consuming acidic substances
• Use a straw to minimize contact with teeth

Protective Dental Products
**Specialized toothpastes** designed for sensitive teeth can provide significant relief by blocking nerve pathways.

When to See a Dentist

Persistent tooth sensitivity might indicate underlying dental issues. Consider professional consultation if:

• Sensitivity lasts more than a few weeks
• Pain is severe or increasing
• Accompanied by swelling or bleeding
• Impacts daily eating and drinking habits

Comprehensive Dental Care Approach

Maintaining overall oral hygiene is crucial in managing tooth sensitivity. Regular dental check-ups, proper brushing techniques, and a balanced diet can significantly reduce discomfort and prevent further dental issues.

Now I understand it is not possible for everybody and I am privileged. 

I started to work at 16, saved and moved out. For years they tried to make me culpability for leaving. I just stopped visiting.

I am now surrounded by people I love and who love me. Took me YEARS to not flinch when someone is moving to close to me or even not cry when I spilled or break something. It was hard for me to understand that I was allowed to have feelings, to be upset, to be mad, to establish boundaries.

I know it is hard because they put on you the pressure that you always need to stay close to support everybody but here is the thing : you are not a social worker.

Pack your bags and leave.

Don't stay in a toxic/homophobic/sexism environment.

You scarred to be alone? create your community. 

Go to the elder center of your city and let the old ladies teach you how to knit. They always have very cute stories from their youth and talking with them you will realise how more conservative our generation is. They give good advice. And it is free

Join a book club. Learn how to swim. Go to pirates class. Use bumble BFF. Ask the cool coworker around your age if they wanna grab coffee during the break.

I moved in so many places and in all of them I managed to create myself a community. You are not alone, specially if you are a black woman. We have each other. I remember being in Turkey and seeing another black girl and she was so happy to see another person like her that we spent the day togheter.

And once you leave, limit your visit. Yes they will make you feel guilty about it but being selfish is the price to save your mental health.

1myq3c4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1myq3c4,Maybe Hawas / Hawas Ice is just not for me and some others experiences,"Hi Family,
First of all, thanks a lot for introducing me to the fragrance world ! 
I still a newbie.
 
1. 
I had ordered these Hawas decants from Perfume Gyan.

I'm quite a beginner but when I tried Hawas Ice, it just smells almost like Edge, just a bit better.

So if you're thinking about buying ice, just check if you like Wild Stone Edge or not.

Hawas OG is similar but I have found Ice better comparatively.

So my conclusion is I don't feel Hawas is for me. Just found it a normal medicare one.

Note - About Perfume Gyan, I think it's expensive and also the decants are small. Secondly their delivery service is shit basically the Bluedart service is really trashy here in Pune. ( please suggest some alternatives to buy decants from )

2. 
I had bought this Tommy Now from a Mall, I really liked it's fragrance but it's costly and it's longevity is very bad. Hardly 1 hour if you sit in a closed environment.

So expert Bros please suggest some similar perfumes that I can try.

3. 
This House of Brown - Eternal wave smells extremely synthetic. Didn't like it at all. Saw some youtuber telling it's almost same as Hawas. So gave it a shot. This was before knowing decants exist.

4. 
Also I wanted to try out the Khamrah / Quhwa. Haven't ordered them yet. I'm looking for some better alternative to order decants.
Also I had visited this in Pune - https://maps.app.goo.gl/fYRiVY1zhL6AvPMF7

Here I tried the clone of Khamrah and I found it good. Smelled like some hot chocolatey coffee-ish type smell. Like a hot drink. But I want to try the originals.

5. 
Also I had tried the Ajmal Blue and I really loved it. Have some mixed reviews but thinking to but it as a perfect summer perfume. 


Tldr : 
i. Hawas Ice is just like Edge but better.
ii. Please suggest some alternatives places to buy decants from. Want to try Khamrah ones.
iii. Please suggest alternative for Tommy Now.
iv. Apart from these if there are any other perfumes if you think I'll really like, please suggest.

1myq2nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1myq2nj/untitled/,Untitled,"A couple of months ago, LinkedIn told me that you had viewed my profile and ever since, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about what I had done to you. I have no idea if I am going to send this to you yet or even what exactly I am going to say in this outside of I am so so sorry for putting you through all of that.

For a long time, I had just avoided the thought of it all. I think I tried avoiding the feelings of guilt and of shame that came from my actions. We haven’t talked in so long and I feel like I hadn’t given you a proper apology. I have no idea if it is something that you would even want but I recently told a friend of mine about how everything had gone down and she told me that she thinks I should let you know but I really don’t know.

Like I said, these last few months, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the literal hell I put you through with my actions. I have thought about the time we spent together. The plans we talked about for our future. The dates we had. The kisses, the smiles and hugs. I introduced you to my family and you introduced me to yours.

Then I think about what it must’ve felt like for you when you started noticing the changes in my behaviour. When I was maybe not as enthusiastic to see you as I had been before. When I wouldn’t pay as much attention to you as I had done in the past. I think about the fact that you might’ve been wondering what was changing and if it were anything you were doing. I think about the fact that you might have brushed it off as me probably being stressed with work and might’ve tried not to think too much about it. I think about how you kept me in your prayers hoping things would get better for me and the whole time, I had been betraying your love to that extent.

This is a lot harder to write down than I thought it would be.

Then I think about how I lied to you when I told you I wanted to break up. As if all I have said already wasn’t enough. I think about how I would wake up to see that you had been typing messages that never arrived at really late hours of the night. I remember how you said it didn’t make sense. I can only imagine how confused you must’ve felt in those days.

I think about the day I finally told you the real reason I wanted to break up with you. I think about the pain in your face and in your voice. Sometimes if I think hard enough, I can vividly picture you telling me that you forgive me right there and then. I think about what I would’ve said or done if I had been in your shoes and I don’t know if I will ever understand where you found the strength to say those words in that moment.

Finally, I think about what the aftermath might have been like for you. The hours you spent thinking and living through the pain I put you through. Pain that you never should have ever experienced. I hate to think about all the nights you had cried thinking about all of it. The bitter taste that I might have left in your mouth after. All the times that you had to clutch your heart because of the pain you felt. I think about how all the good times we spent together might have then brought you a lot of pain. I think about how despite the fact that you were suffering, you had to get up and do thing everyday because the world didn’t stop to wait for you to nurse your heart ache.

I think about how you opened yourself up to me. All the difficult things you had told me you had been through. The moments of depressive episodes you had suffered and how you had found your way back up again and the question I keep coming back to is how could I have done all of that to you?

I really don’t know what I could say to you right now. Sorry doesn’t fix a broken plate and it definitely doesn't come close to mending a broken heart. But for whatever it is worth, I really am sorry for all of it.

I think about how good and kind you had been to me. You were the first person outside my family to ever get me jewelry. You found out I loved coffee and bought me a mug. You wrote me letters that have become really hard to read leading up to valentine’s day all about how much you loved me. You would talk to me about your joys and your frustrations in them and how much your boss used to annoy you.

you really are special. What sort of person does what I did to a person like you? There are so many more things that I haven’t put in here. I can’t believe that I put you through all of that. You didn’t deserve any of it. Sometimes I wonder if I would have preferred to have never met you. Just so that you wouldn’t have had to go through all that you went through.

I think my punishment for what I did to you will come eventually and when it does, I will accept it. It will be the least I deserve for everything I did to you.

I am so so sorry for all of it. All the things I might’ve have got right in this and all of the things that I might never know you had to live through. If you are reading this, I truly hope that this letter served as some sort of comfort for you and not take you back and made things worse. You deserved so much better than me and I wish I had known that before putting you through all of this.

I think about the work you might have to do to love and trust someone new again. I hate myself for putting you through all of it. Nobody deserves that kind of treatment least of all you.

This isn’t an attempt to reconnect. I just wanted to say I really am sorry for all of it. I really hope this helps more than it hurts you. It would kill me to know that I have been the source of even more pain to your life.

I hope you are a lot better than you maybe were last year. It was never about anything you had done, I was just a really really terrible person who didn’t deserve to have any space in your life.

 If there is anything you need from me, I will be here. It really is the least I could do after everything. I am so sorry.",3,1756023720.0,UnsentLetters,2,1.0,False

# A Cultural Icon, Layer by Layer

[Mpaklavas](https://cyprusvoyage.com/mpaklavas-discover-cyprus-traditional-sweet-with-rich-heritage/), the Cypriot version of baklava, is a dessert that radiates warmth, richness, and tradition. Built from countless thin layers of buttery phyllo pastry, generously filled with walnuts, almonds, and a touch of cinnamon, it is finally bathed in a golden syrup scented with citrus or spices. The result is a sweet that is both indulgent and deeply symbolic of Cyprus’s culinary heritage.

# Roots in History

The story of mpaklavas stretches back centuries. Its origins can be traced to ancient Mediterranean and Middle Eastern kitchens, refined during the Byzantine era and reaching new prominence under the Ottomans. In Cyprus, it was once considered a luxury reserved for celebrations, weddings, and religious feasts. Over time, it became a familiar treasure in homes across the island, lovingly prepared by families who passed recipes down through generations.

# Tradition in Practice

Preparing mpaklavas is an art of patience. Sheets of phyllo are brushed with melted butter and layered with a fragrant nut mixture of walnuts, almonds, sugar, and cinnamon. Once stacked high, the pastry is cut into diamonds or squares, baked until golden, and then soaked with cool syrup poured over the hot pastry. This allows every layer to absorb the sweetness, creating a delicate balance of crispness and syrupy softness. Variations exist, such as rolled versions scented with rosewater, which highlight the versatility of this dessert.

# More Than Just Dessert

In Cyprus, mpaklavas is not only a treat—it is a symbol of unity and hospitality. It represents moments of family togetherness, festive gatherings, and the island’s rich cultural blend. Shared between Greek and Turkish Cypriots alike, it reflects a culinary bond that transcends history and differences. Each tray baked is a gesture of generosity, often prepared in abundance to be shared with neighbors and guests.

# Celebrated and Cherished

From village bakeries to bustling city cafés, mpaklavas remains a centerpiece of Cypriot life. It is enjoyed with a strong cup of Cypriot coffee, given as a gift during holidays, or set proudly at the heart of wedding feasts. Its presence connects people not just to a beloved flavor, but to a heritage woven through centuries.

# In Summary

Cypriot mpaklavas is more than a dessert—it is a story baked in layers. It carries history, tradition, and the warmth of hospitality in every bite. Whether savored in a quiet home kitchen or at a festive celebration, mpaklavas continues to embody the spirit of Cyprus: generous, resilient, and deeply rooted in its culture.",1,1756023463.0,DiscoverCyprus,0,1.0,False

Instead of fancy night-outs, I would rather we have cozy days and nights instead — where we watch animes, read and discuss books, and discover new coffee shops together. We can even go shopping together if you are also into collecting toys and trinkets.
