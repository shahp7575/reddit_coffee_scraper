Our parents flew in for my nephew's birthday. I took them out to eat their last day in town and was shocked at their statements. They asked if they'd told me about the ""mexican gang member"" at their hotel. Proceeded to say a man with a long goatee and tattoos was in their lobby. My mom said she was so afraid of him yet approached him to ask why he was there. He said he was in town training for a new job. They kept saying they couldn't believe a gang member was getting a real job. I told them they were being offensive and to stop calling him a gang member. Then they asked if I heard about the pool incident from the day prior. I hadn't, so they went on to say that a guy with a big swastika tattoo came into the hotel pool while they were there swimming with my sister's kids and the other set of grandparents. They said the in laws and my sister's family were disgusted and left the pool. My parents then defended the white supremacist and said we don't know if he's changed how he feels and that he might have a tattoo removal appointment scheduled. I cut them off and told them to stop it. Then my dad got mad that I was siding with the in laws and started yelling that the kids other grandpa wants Biden ""gone"". (My parents vote dem, the inlaws are repub and nobody has ever heard the other grandpa say anything like that.) I sternly said stop and that I was leaving and my mom got mad that I was making them leave before she finished her coffee. I paid at the register, left the restaurant and saw them later at the birthday party, where my mom told a stranger (who commented on how long my nephew is) that large kids come from our side of the family and they should have seen how big I was. Went on and on about how I've always been larger than my friends and was always 2 sizes bigger than the other kids even in HS. (I'm 5'4"" and average build, nobody has ever called me large or tall and I'm often shorter than most peers) I was also sitting on the deck when she said that so I just got up and went into the yard with the kids. I left early, and then they flew home. 

Before this trip they also asked me to give up my bed and sleep on my couch during their visit even though my sister has a guest room that nobody used. They got mad when I said no and ended up booking the hotel. I'm single with an apartment while everyone else has a house with spare rooms. 

It's gotten worse over the past 5 years. The rest of the family wants to just eye roll and start planning my other nephew's birthday in a few months but I feel like I want to cut off communication and I don't want to see them when they visit again.

1l39k3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/suppsavings/comments/1l39k3f/i_switched_from_3_popular_proteins_to_transparent/,I switched from 3 popular proteins to Transparent Labs Whey for 60 days; here's what changed,"Three tubs. Three brands. Same gut issues.

That was me, rotating between Gold standard, Dymatize ISO100, and Ghost whey for over a year.

Gas. Bloating. Weird fatigue post-shake. You name it.

But I didn‚Äôt think the protein itself was the problem.

Until I stripped it all back and ran a solo test.

60 days. One switch. Transparent Labs 100% Grass-Fed Whey.

Here‚Äôs what actually happened.

# Week 1: No more digestive chaos

Literally the first thing I noticed.

No bloating.

No burps that taste like chemical dessert.

Turns out when you drop artificial sweeteners and stick to cold-processed whey isolate with *just* stevia, your body actually thanks you.

I went from dreading post-shake bloat to genuinely forgetting I drank it.

If your stomach has been screaming from other proteins, this is the first place I‚Äôd start:[ Transparent Labs 100% Grass-Fed Whey](https://www.transparentlabs.com/products/proteinseries-100-grass-fed-whey-protein-isolate/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=impact&utm_campaign=131624_Online%20Tracking%20Link&irgwc=1).

# Week 2‚Äì4: Muscle recovery, but smoother

I didn‚Äôt expect a noticeable performance bump.

But my post-leg-day soreness? Shorter.

Sleep? Felt deeper, especially on double training days.

Whey is whey, but isolate hits different when it‚Äôs not full of junk.

I stayed consistent, 1 scoop post-workout, usually with oat milk.

Macros are clean: 28g protein, 1g carbs, zero fat, no sugar.

# Week 5‚Äì6: The energy shift

This one took longer to notice.

I wasn't crashing mid-day like before.

Maybe it was the lack of sucralose, or just the reduced inflammation from a cleaner blend.

But I felt steady. Sharp. Not jittery.

Zero caffeine in this, which made it a nice pair with my stim-heavy pre.

Recovery got tighter, sleep got better, and my appetite regulated too.

# Flavor-wise: Better than it should be

I went with French Vanilla and Dark Chocolate.

French Vanilla is stupid good with coffee.

Dark Chocolate is rich, mixes smooth, no weird aftertaste.

Honestly, I was shocked by how good it tasted for a formula that clean.

No artificial flavors, just real ingredients.

People hype the taste, and it actually delivers.

# What's missing?

Honestly? Two things.

* It's not the cheapest ($59.99 per tub)  
* It doesn't come in a smaller trial size  

If you're not ready to commit, you're rolling the dice flavor-wise.

But if you're tired of playing roulette with your gut and protein, it's a calculated bet.

# Final verdict after 60 days

I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd notice a difference.

I just wanted less bloat.

But I ended up feeling stronger, sleeping better, and actually enjoying my shakes again.

The zero-filler formula matters more than I thought.

And it's made me rethink what ""clean"" protein actually means.

If you're training hard and tired of mystery blends, Transparent labs whey might be what flips the switch.

1l39k2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tetsudinarc/comments/1l39k2e/city_spotlight_sanvar/,City spotlight Sanvar,"To the western edge of the southern plains lies a group of Interesting rock formations. These crumbling remnants of mountains block the moisture of the western ocean from getting to the silver sands dessert to the south. On the dry eastern side of this formation lies the city of Sanvar. Originaly a military outpost like Talmore to protect the kingdoms of midrealm from interlopers from the south, it grew with the discovery of rich gold deposits. It became a trading hub. The wandering caravans of the southern Janni are a common sight in sanvar. They bring exotic spices and rare goods from the far side of the silver sands desserts. Knowledgable wanderers, the Janni have influenced the local culture. They bring a love of coffee, and hold coffee ceremonies where they brew a thick frothy delight using  copper kettles they drag through hot sand to percolate their favored drink to perfection. They roast meats on vertical spits that slowly rotate and carve thin slices to eat with flatbread and exotic sauces. The Janni and those that wander with them are a welcome sight at any bazaar or merchant square. Their elders love games of castles, and tell tales of the great ruins of the dessert. Their love of fine incenses and spices make Sanvar smell intoxicating, and their music and dance can fill the streets during their many yearly celebrations Sanvar a destination for the tribes of the dessert to meet and trade with each others as well as the northern visitors from elsewhere in midrealm. On some occasions these great caravans meet in sanvar to hold glorious weddings, fantastic celebrations that unite two families and can last for days, filling the streets with mirth and drunken attendees. These caravans are known to trade whole wagons of goods and leave with chests laden with the gold of the local mines.

The local gold mines and Industry are owned by families that have lived in Sanvar since the founding. The many stores and shops are filled with the crafts and tools of their descendants. Farther from town the claims get fewer and farther apart. Within the great labrythian maze of canyons called blockrim the mining is less monitored and more dangerous. The crests of the low ridge mountains to the southwest hold many bandits, and claim jumpers. These stealthy inhabitants look for any opportunity to take advantage of others good fortune. whole mining camps have been wiped out when their leaders head to town with gold for supplies. Many tales of caution exist to warn newcommers about the need for secrecy of their claims and the dangers of the trek to town laiden with the wealth of the hills. Many prospector groups travel farther and farther into the wilds to avoid the dangers of the ridge thieves of blockrim. 

Some travel the great distance all the way to soda spring, the last water before the ravages of the dessert. Collected here roughly 350 miles south of sanvar, this settlement is known for its rock hounds and their love of the local geology. Many ""dust beard"" dwarves of the dessert comb the hills and plains to find those rare agate and opal stones from the dry dessert. The dry land here is full of soft sandstone, and potch. These dwarves dig massive underground homes with winding tunnels to hide from the worst ravages of the unforgiving southern sun. Here hot winds blow and dust storms can rage from the dessert into the hills and plains. This area has savannahs with trees acclimated to the hot and dry climate. Wild lions sometimes raid soda springs and drag off the local goats and cows the village depends on. From these foothills of the low ridge mountains, are fantastic views stretching over the plains to the east and the sands to the south.  

To the west of Blockrim on the western side of the low ridges lies a mountain side battered by hurricanes. As the wet warm ocean air climbs these hills they cool and cause mists and rain to batter the rocks apart. a more gentle climb than the dry hills on the other side of the mountain chain, these misty hills hold lots of life and greenery. Here one can find the coffee, chocolate, and fruits that the janni usually gather for trade in sanvar to the northeast. The many shallow mountain lakes gather the rain, and it drains down waterfalls and creeks to run back to the ocean below. These rounded mountain sides over look the great expanse of the ten thousand isles. While very few come here, the mountain sides are filled with life and natural beuty, with gorgeous sunsets unrivalled in midrealm. As the sun dips to the horizon hundreds of tiny isles can be seen agaisnt the simmering sea. 

Instead of heading straight east to the capital of Orren, the road travels north to a fork in the road. One path leads to Dinavore, And the other branches eastward to Orren. Here at the southern most tip of the great forest, lies the settlement of shady fork. A small town where wood is cut and gathered to travel south to Sanvar, Gold from Sanvar goes to Orren, and The Granite stones of Dinavore travel to Orren, This town is arguably one of the best places to live and raise a family in all of Midrealm. Protected on all sides, and free of the bustle of the other great cities of midrealm, this quiet community thrives. Its flat fertile lands and great ancient trees make a picture perfect setting for a calm uncomplicated life. with access to trade from anywhere else in midrealm, it has all the comforts available in the world. Its position next to Orren and its pentarch allow goods from any of the capitals, its position near sanvar gives it exotic fruits and spices, as well as a steady trade of gold and rare stones. Its location south of dinavore allow it to get trade of the delicious platinum trout and its caviar. While its population is a great mix of many peoples, its tiny footprint and low population allow for everyone to know everyone else. While some consider it boring, its residents want for nothing, and are not threatened by the cares so frequent in other parts of midrealm. Its flat land, low light polution, and safe nature make it ideal for its one claim to fame. The great observatory, and orrery are built near the outskirts of the small town. The great orrery depicts the movements of the sky and planets around midrealm, as well as some of the interplanar movements and interactions around the realm. This great slow moving machine is the one tourist attraction for scholars, and visiting intellectuals. The observatory, is slightly older and placed slightly farther away from the light of the town. Its observations of the sky allowed for the calculations and precise clockwork movements of the orrery. It provides  warnings of impending celestial events, and allows research to provide insights to past events. Paid for and constructed by the genius gnomes, these buildings are also places of quiet respite for weary or retired gnomes. 

While sanvar proper is still a bustling trade center and active city, there are many mining towns that have become abandoned and decrepid over the years. These ghost towns are usually home to a mine. Through either great tragedy or slow decline, each has failed due to misfortune. Some adventurers hold contracts with wealthy clients to find and secure these old ghost towns. The adventurous descend in to the mines to find if they still hold any value. Then upon finding a mine still rich with gold, they attempt to revive the town. Creating places to gather and hold water, blazing safe trails to one day become regular rodes. Driving off any dangerous or troublesome wild life to protect the town. bringing in and raising the first livestock to provide food. Once the town is safe they also bring in miners and support staff. Whole families move to once abandoned locations in the hopes of a better life. The adventurous are tasked with keeping the towns safe over a time, until the contract has been fullfilled. Then the adventerous that worked so hard to establish the settlement are provided a percentage of any gold found in the mines. This lucrative yet dangerous undertaking can be the source of many wealthy people, and the source of many horrible deaths. Some times raiders come to take what they can, other times blue dragons arrive and demand tribute, and most commonly the water runs dry and the town dissapears once more. Those tenacious and capable few to revive and keep a town thriving can make long lasting fortunes that secure their families for generations. Some of the wealthy financiers who create these mining town contracts, were once adventurers who revived a town of their own. In this way new life has been brought to the hills around Sanvar. The market places of Sanvar flourish providing goods for the endeavors, and the gold of the hills flows through Sanvar with a small tax on its way. 

The revival of ghost towns is not the only way to gamble for fortune in sanvar. In this dessert town certain games of chance are legal and held to a high standard by the law. The winnings of gambling are taxed with a small percentage, and great resort  casinos are built to provide miners with a way to spend their earnings. Some lucky individuals win fortunes in these games, some winning the mining rights, or deeds to entire townships. some places only gamble for rare gems, and all are opulent and flow with alcohol and great delicious food. An entire population thrives on serving and providing entertainment in the gambling halls. Many of the original families that held mining claims, then went on to sell mining tools and equipment, and ultimately continue growing their wealth by establishing hotels, and casinos. Their comfort, and hospitality is only matched by their security and watchful attention. These casinos work hand in hand with the local law enforcement and pay a high tax on the winning of the house for this cooperation. The consequences for cheating or theft is often overwhelming and persued by the local branch of the silver knights. Each of the wealthiest casinos are also home to a master mage.  These casinos are usually found near the market squares, bathhouses, and bazzars.",1,1749053395.0,Tetsudinarc,0,1.0,False

I tried baking a Coffee Chiffon Cake using the following recipe:

**Ingredients**:

* Corn oil: 30g
* Milk: 40g
* Instant coffee powder: 5g
* Hot water: 1 tsp
* Cake flour: 60g
* Salt: 1g
* Egg yolk: 3
* Egg white: 3
* Sugar: 60g

The original recipe uses a 6-inch pan with a removable bottom and instructs baking at **130¬∞C for 60 minutes**. It also says not to grease the Pan. I followed this recipe *twice* but used **two 5-inch pans** instead of one 6-inch pan. I baked them at **130¬∞C for 50 minutes**. After baking, I turned the cakes upside down to cool completely (to prevent collapse), but they still **deflated after cooling**.

I'm not sure what went wrong. Could it be:

* The smaller pans?
* The reduced baking time?
* Under-whipped or over-whipped egg whites?
* Oven temperature?

We have one person on my operations team who is chronically late. There are other issues with their performance, but I'd like to stick to this for now. 

They live a 30-minute walk from work and have wild reasons every day for her lateness (they spilled coffee, there was a fire a street over, all of the bike docks were taken -- because everyone had already arrived at work). My boss who is a partner and arrives late herself at the agency, so does not see this employee arrive 30 minutes late most days. My boss is, however, on all of the emails with the excuses. Because she is not here to clock the employee‚Äôs  actual in-time, I tend to send emails back to the ""late"" messages after 20 minutes or so. I understand I need to be more forthright, but my boss has a soft spot for her and can be a bit reactive. 

Last week however, the was forty minutes late with coffee. My boss sternly told them in no uncertain terms that she has no excuse and she needs to be on time. 

Last week it was requested on a public slack channel that a standing 9:30 meeting be pushed to 9:15 to make time for client meetings. Today they said they 'made a mistake' pushing today's meeting to 9:15 and slid it back to 9:30, not acknowledging the screenshots of last week's request when presented. 

If they hadn't rolled in (with coffee) at 9:15, I would give them the benefit of the doubt that they unintentionally crossed wires. I am struggling with what my position is. I understand I am supposed to enforce policy, but my boss is already aware. My boss is on that slack channel where this happened. She can get very touchy. I wasn't directly involved and people come to me to complain rather than action things. I have coached them on how to broach these subjects, both with the offending employee and my boss. 

What is my responsibility here? I want to be among the Good HR and be effective for my colleagues and the organization. I don‚Äôt have a mentor here and would love to just get some perspective.

No lightning bolt focus. No Limitless movie moment.

Just 2 capsules every morning with water, then straight into work.

But over three weeks, I noticed things shifting, slowly, then all at once.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown.

# Setup was easy

No caffeine.

No stomach upset.

Just two pills that didn‚Äôt taste weird or hit hard.

The first few days felt like nothing, honestly.

But I wasn‚Äôt chasing a stimulant. That was the point.

# Days 1‚Äì7: Subtle shifts, nothing dramatic

The first week was boring.

My brain didn‚Äôt feel sharper.

Focus wasn‚Äôt magically improved.

But I did notice I was less scattered by distractions.

It was like background noise got slightly quieter.

I started finishing tasks quicker, without realizing why.

# Days 8‚Äì14: Real changes began

This is when it started to feel intentional.

The mental ""drag"" I usually felt around 2 PM? Mostly gone.

Reading long documents or writing scripts felt less like a chore.

What shocked me most was my stress response.

Emails that usually pissed me off? Didn't hit as hard.

I wasn‚Äôt more hyped, just less reactive.

# Day 15‚Äì21: Sustained clarity, no crash

Week three was the clincher.

I woke up clear-headed. Even on five hours of sleep.

I started tackling deeper work in the mornings.

The combination of focus plus calm felt oddly balanced.

And weirdly, I stopped reaching for afternoon coffee altogether.

I didn't plan that. It just happened.

# What worked best

* Citicoline + Lion's Mane = noticeable brain ""clean-up""  
* No jitters, no crash, no come down  
* Improved stress control under pressure  
* Easier deep focus sessions (1‚Äì2 hours straight)  
* More resilience on sleep-deprived days  

# What didn‚Äôt work

* No quick hit (you need patience)  
* Bacopa and Rhodiola are underdosed compared to clinical studies  
* Expensive if you‚Äôre used to budget nootropics  
* Doesn‚Äôt replace good sleep or lifestyle basics  

# Who it‚Äôs for

If you want caffeine-like productivity without actual caffeine, this is rare.

If you‚Äôre stacking nootropics, it plays well with L-theanine, creatine, and light adaptogens.

If you're chasing energy spikes, skip this.

But if you want clean, functional cognitive support that lasts beyond the buzz, it earns a spot.

1l39h5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialaid/comments/1l39h5i/do_people_completely_misunderstand_the_student/,Do people completely misunderstand the student loan crisis?,"Im starting this by saying I will be starting as a freshman in the fall. I will be taking out private student loans. I am not posting this to attack anyone, but to ask questions and get genuine responses because I see some really idiotic things that get projected onto the population of people taking out private loans as a whole, and want to address them. 

  
\#1: **Getting a degree that costs more than the salary** \- This is the most basic one that I think solves a majority of the problems. Why on Earth are people going to school, spending 100k dollars, to get a degree that is never going to pay that back? I'll take education as an example. I have the utmost respect for our educators because they play a big part in shaping the society we live in. It runs deeply in my family for multiple generations so I feel I can say this, but it is ridiculous to go anywhere but a cheap community college for an education degree (and even at that, it may not be worth it). The same goes for any other degree that just does not provide an opportunity to pay off that debt quickly. I think most of the student loan debt we have is from who either drop out, or those who get degrees that make it impossible to find a sustainable source of income on top of these loan payments. 

  
\#2: **People have zero plans going into college -** I know what I am going for, and I have an extremely detailed plan for how to get to where I want. I have done countless hours of research, and am already making connections in the industry I plan to head into. Yes I understand that plans change, I think like 80% of college students change their declared major at least once. That's not the point. The point I'm making is a lot of people have absolutely zero clue on how they are going to pay off these loans, how to get into the job field, and how to be successful in college. Why are you going to a state school, or somewhere out of state, if you are an undecided/exploratory studies major? This is something I see an insane amount of people doing. People simply don't have plans. 

  
\#3: **Lifestyle choices -** I think this is the biggest one people don't want to look at. I will be working 20 hours a week in college. I won't be partying. I won't be gambling. I won't be going on coffee runs every morning. I'm not going to be spending any money. I will also be living with my parents for around 3 years post-graduation (Yes, I understand not everyone has this opportunity). The amount of money people end up spending (or not making) by constantly doing these things that, by the way, have nothing to do with the purpose of college, is astounding. I am planning to pay off as much of my student loans while in school possible, while also being extremely frugal with spending ( a habit I already had in high school ). The difference this will make for me in 4 years in time considering interest and all else, compared to someone who is hypothetically taking out the exact same amount as me, and then not living with their parents afterward, is just night and day. 

\#4: **Refusing to accept any blame -** ""No one told me about this / I wish people would have told me about this"". The truth is, you could've found all that out by yourself without a parent telling you. I do not come from a wealthy household. I am very grateful for my situation and know a lot of people would do anything to trade places with me, but there are no college savings for me besides what I have saved myself. I will be paying for 100% of my student loans (obviously still applying to as many scholarships as possible). It really bothers me when people say they just didn't come from a wealthy family and because of that everything has been made to work against them. That they didn't have someone holding their hand all the way through. The truth is, I could say the same exact thing. But i don't because I've done my research, I've made a plan (relating back to number 2 on this list, most of these same people don't have plans), and I took action. When you sign on to student loans, you should be doing so both as the young adult making those choices in college that can have lifelong-impacts, but also as the adult working a job and balancing both of those to determine if the loans are worth it. 

\#5: **People don't read or do their research** \-  This kind of ties into a couple of other points, but I have seen people that say when the federal loan forgiveness came out a couple of years ago they stopped making payments on their private loans because they didn't understand, and now have an insane amount of debt compared to what they took out. My response to that is yeah, that was stupid. People need to do their research before making decisions like that. Also, people have talked about some of the ""evil things"" these lenders throw in contracts. I completely understand interest rates are out of hand and these lenders care about nothing but making as much money as possible. At the end of the day, you didn't have to sign that paper that had a ridiculous clause u failed to read and then get upset about when it's enforced later on. 

  
All of these are things I constantly see when hearing about someone's student loan situation. Unlucky things happen and I am 100% positive that there are people who didn't do a single thing I mentioned and still found themselves in a bad spot. Whenever people say ""private loans are not an option"" I just can't help but think that some of these things I've mentioned aren't being taken into consideration. I really can't wrap my head around the idea that private loans are so bad that if I don't do any of those things, and I do continue with my path into a job field that is well paying at entry level with huge room for growth that I will still be weighted down so hard by student loans I won't be able to breathe. 

  
**Conclusion:** I'll be upfront, I'm taking out a lot of money in private loans. My fafsa is only enough to cover about 20% of the cost. I will be paying off as much as I can while in school working, and then when I graduate I am working my ass off, living at home, and not spending money to get these loans done as fast as I possibly can. If there is anything I said that was misinformed, please tell me. I have to be honest, I am not super worried about my loan situation. Yeah, it will suck for a couple of years, but it will make life so much easier afterwards. Well over 90% of the loan crisis situations I read about have something to do with a reason mentioned above. I feel like I have put myself in a good spot to be successful and get these loans paid off as fast as possible.

1l39gxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1l39gxv/i_26f_was_seeing_a_recently_divorced_man_38m_for/,I (26F) was seeing a recently divorced man (38M) for a few months.,"We had great chemistry, thoughtful dates, deep conversations, and it felt like we were building something meaningful. He planned most of our outings brunches, coffee dates, even got us courtside tickets to see the Toronto Raptors. He made me feel seen. I responded with small things too: I made a birthday jar full of handwritten notes, got him a thoughtful gift, and planned a special day trip for his birthday.

Just a few days before his birthday, he suddenly told me he wasn‚Äôt ready for anything serious and ‚Äúcould only be exclusive to himself right now.‚Äù He said he still needed to heal from his divorce.

It hit me hard. Especially because he had brought up exclusivity early on, and constantly gave me the impression that this was something real. He'd say he missed me, that I was a positive force in his life, and that our time together was meaningful. But when things started to deepen, he shut down. On his birthday, I called him sad and emotional and he coldly said, ‚ÄúYou have the whole summer to get over it.‚Äù

Later, he thanked me for the birthday gift and said, ‚ÄúThe man who ends up with you is lucky.‚Äù But that honestly just stung more.

It‚Äôs been tough processing everything.

Was I just a soft place for him to land after his divorce? Did I mistake effort for emotional availability?",2,1749053187.0,relationship_advice,4,1.0,False

I kinda of want to vent and look for some encouragement. 

I‚Äôm on day three of my treatment. I have 20 trays total so thinking I‚Äôll have 10 months to go. 

I don‚Äôt want to put anyone reading off, as I am likely just having starting out panic. I think they look really good you can‚Äôt notice them at all and thankfully no lisp. 

On to the breakdown.

I‚Äôm seriously struggling with the thought of doing this for 10 months. 

The biggest challenge I‚Äôm find is eating. 

I am taking them out twice a day to eat a lunch coffee and later my dinner. The whole process of removing them, eating waiting 10 minutes to brush, brushing, trying get them back in takes an hour with 15 minutes left to eat. I‚Äôm so hangry and hungry üòÇ ( maybe I‚Äôll lose some weight silver lining )

Secondary is how dry my mouth is and lips, can‚Äôt imagine this feeling for 10 mouths. Does get any better ? 

Lastly is the Generally pain which I can deal with somewhat as I had braces through my teens but I feel like I‚Äôm really biting down on my back teeth. 

I‚Äôve paid ¬£4k up front for this so not like I can really stop now but I really don‚Äôt feel like myself. I‚Äôd love so tips or encouragement, please tell me it gets better.

1l39fpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/masculinemennow/comments/1l39fpj/why_your_dopamine_supplement_might_be_making/,Why your dopamine supplement might be making things worse,"A lot of people start taking dopamine boosters expecting motivation to magically appear.

You pop it, wait 20 minutes, and assume it‚Äôll feel like coffee for your soul.

But here‚Äôs the reality: boosting dopamine without fixing the **actual friction** underneath can backfire hard.

Let me explain.

# More dopamine isn‚Äôt always the answer

Your brain doesn‚Äôt just need dopamine ‚Äî it needs to handle it properly.

You could be making plenty, but if your receptor sensitivity is off, or your breakdown pathways are clogged, you‚Äôre just flooding a broken system.

That‚Äôs like pouring fuel into a car with a cracked engine block.

Feels powerful‚Ä¶ then sputters.

# Why you feel good then worse

Ever had a supplement give you that spark ‚Äî then leave you flat 3 hours later?

That‚Äôs often dopamine spikes at work.

They push your system hard up front.

But if your sleep, stress, or even micronutrient levels aren‚Äôt solid, you can't keep up with the demand.

The result? More fatigue. More mood swings. Less motivation the next day.

Basically, you burned through reserves that weren‚Äôt ready to be spent.

# You're not low on drive ‚Äî you're low on stability

Big mistake most people make: thinking they need more dopamine because they feel ‚Äúoff.‚Äù

But it‚Äôs usually not a lack of drive ‚Äî it‚Äôs poor regulation.

Too much stimulation (scrolling, caffeine, chaos) numbs your response over time.

So even if you *do* raise dopamine, the brain‚Äôs like: ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù

That‚Äôs why even strong noots can feel dead after a week or two.

You‚Äôre pouring into a desensitized system.

# What to check before adding anything

Ask yourself this:

* Are you sleeping 6‚Äì8 hours consistently?  
* Is your diet missing B-vitamins, tyrosine, magnesium?  
* Are you stacking stims with no break?  
* Have you been ‚Äúnumb‚Äù to dopamine hits (e.g., endless scrolling, short dopamine loops)?  
* Is your stress baseline stuck at a 7/10 or higher?  

If you answered ‚Äúyes‚Äù to more than one of those, fix that first.

Supplements work best when they‚Äôre supporting something healthy, not patching up something broken.

# The worst part? You won‚Äôt always notice it

A lot of people say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not working.‚Äù

But what‚Äôs really happening is subtle burnout.

Not the obvious crash.

The invisible kind ‚Äî where you stop caring, start ghosting tasks, or feel flat all day.

And if you double down thinking more = better?

That‚Äôs how you end up worse than before.

# TL;DR

* Dopamine boosters aren‚Äôt magic, and can backfire if your system isn‚Äôt ready.  
* Receptor fatigue is real. So is motivational numbness.  
* Sleep, micronutrients, and stress control matter more than the bottle you pick.  
* Fix the foundation before adding nootropics. Otherwise, it‚Äôs just noise.",1,1749053108.0,masculinemennow,0,1.0,False

A few years ago, I was stuck in a creative rut‚Äîunable to finish a script and questioning if I was meant to be a filmmaker. Eventually, I let go of the idea that I had to direct something I wrote, and instead posted a callout for scripts on Shooting People.¬†

We met for coffee, clicked immediately, and without thinking about it twice took the plunge: I was going to make this film with a person I‚Äôd only just met.

1l39drv,https://www.reddit.com/r/masculinemennow/comments/1l39drv/30_days_on_dopamine_6_unexpected_changes_in/,30 days on dopamine+: 6 unexpected changes in motivation and focus,"Motivation wasn't the issue.

Consistency was.

That weird burnout loop where you know what to do, you're wired in theory, but still can't bring yourself to start.

I wasn‚Äôt looking for energy.

I needed clarity. Drive that didn‚Äôt feel forced.

So I gave[ Dopamine+ from transparent labs](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/N9bmQO) a month.

Wasn‚Äôt sure anything was happening the first few days ‚Äî thought I got duped, honestly.

Here‚Äôs what changed.

# 1. Morning delay vanished

Usually I scroll like a zombie for 40 minutes after waking up.

That friction to get going just disappeared by week 2.

Not a stimulant buzz, just a sharper entry into the day.

It felt like my brain stopped hitting the snooze button.

Hard to describe, but it was like mental inertia dropped.

Even on weekends, I wasn‚Äôt dragging.

# 2. Less compulsive multitasking

I didn‚Äôt realize how scattered I‚Äôd become.

Start emails, open Reddit, check steps, back to Slack, grab coffee.

Repeat.

By week 3, I noticed fewer tabs.

My brain wasn‚Äôt jumping around as much.

I‚Äôd just do the thing. Then the next thing.

Focus was less of a battle.

# 3. Mood dips didn‚Äôt spiral

I still had off days.

But the usual ""meh"" didn‚Äôt become ""why bother.""

There was a ceiling to how low my motivation dipped.

Which meant I didn‚Äôt waste whole afternoons crawling back to baseline.

Honestly, this was one of the more surprising shifts.

No hype, just less volatility.

# 4. Caffeine felt optional

I still drank coffee out of habit.

But I didn‚Äôt *need* it.

No pre-meeting spike, no afternoon rescue cup.

Mental energy just felt smoother.

Not up or down, just there.

I forgot what that felt like.

# 5. More follow-through

I‚Äôd always start projects fast.

The drop-off hit by day 3.

This time, ideas had staying power.

Not overnight productivity magic.

Just better execution.

Less ""I‚Äôll finish it tomorrow."" More ""Let's wrap this up.""

# 6. Cleaner transitions

Ever switch tasks and feel like your brain lags behind?

That‚Äôs how I lived.

Now I shift easier.

From lifting to work mode. From calls to writing. From work to unwind.

It‚Äôs like the brain fog between things cleared up.

Even evenings felt more present instead of wired-but-distracted.

# Not a miracle pill, but here‚Äôs the thing

Dopamine+ isn‚Äôt hypey.

No cracked-out focus. No sleep disruption. No afternoon crash.

It‚Äôs subtle.

Which might make people underestimate it.

Didn‚Äôt notice much the first week. Almost shelved it.

But if your problem is brain friction, not energy‚Äîthis helps.

Checked the label ‚Äî no garbage. Just clean stuff that‚Äôs been around:

* L-Tyrosine (for dopamine support)  
* Cognizin Citicoline (clean cognition)  
* Sabroxy (dopamine + neuroprotection)  
* Saffron extract (mood leveling)  
* B6 and Folate (essential co-factors)  

Zero caffeine. No weird blends.

Just clean, targeted support.

Most massage chairs suck.

Not in a ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt turn on‚Äù kind of way, but in a ‚Äúwhy does this feel like someone awkwardly poking me with a rubber spoon‚Äù kind of way.

And the wild part?

People drop $500‚Äì$3000 on these things thinking they‚Äôll fix their back pain or tight calves.

Here‚Äôs why that usually doesn‚Äôt happen.

# 1. They roll, but they don‚Äôt dig

Cheap chairs (and even a lot of mid-range ones) use what are basically rolling pins under your back.

They move up and down, sometimes in circles, maybe side to side.

But there‚Äôs no depth.

No pressure.

Nothing close to a real massage.

If you‚Äôve ever thought, ‚Äúwhy does this feel like it‚Äôs just sliding over me?‚Äù ‚Äî that‚Äôs exactly it.

Look for something that adjusts *depth*, not just direction.

# 2. airbag ‚â† pressure

Airbag compression sounds cool.

‚Äú36 airbags!‚Äù ‚ÄúFull-body air compression!‚Äù Blah blah blah.

But unless the air pressure can be adjusted high enough ‚Äî and targeted well ‚Äî it ends up feeling like someone lightly squeezing your arms with inflatable water wings.

Especially in areas like the calves and forearms, weak airbags just don‚Äôt do much.

More airbags ‚â† better.

It‚Äôs how well they inflate, how tight they get, and whether the coverage actually lines up with your body.

# 3. The fit is way more important than people think

This one gets overlooked all the time.

Even the best massage chair won‚Äôt do much if you‚Äôre the wrong size for it.

If you‚Äôre under 5‚Äô3‚Äù, or over 6‚Äô3‚Äù, chances are the rollers, heat zones, and airbags won‚Äôt hit you where they‚Äôre supposed to.

Same goes for torso length vs leg length.

And it‚Äôs not just comfort ‚Äî a bad fit can make the massage totally useless.

Check the user height range *before* buying, not after.

# 4. heat that‚Äôs just... warm-ish

Heat can make a massage 10x better.

But most chair heat zones barely get warm.

They advertise ‚Äúlumbar heat‚Äù or ‚Äúcalf therapy,‚Äù but you sit down and think, ‚Äúis this thing even on?‚Äù

Really good chairs get that heat *deep* ‚Äî you actually feel it loosening up your back or legs.

If the heat isn‚Äôt at least noticeable after 5 minutes, it‚Äôs probably not helping you much.

# 5. Auto programs are often trash

You know those auto modes that sound amazing?

‚ÄúRelax mode.‚Äù ‚ÄúFull-body deep stretch.‚Äù ‚ÄúRecovery.‚Äù

Sounds great.

But what they often do is combine weak movements in weird patterns ‚Äî too short in one area, too long in another.

And if you can‚Äôt adjust pressure, roller speed, or which body zone it‚Äôs targeting, you‚Äôre stuck.

A good chair lets you tweak everything.

Not just pick a preset and hope it works.

# 6. Noise actually ruins the whole vibe

This one‚Äôs underrated.

You sit down, dim the lights, ready to zen out.

Then you hear *clunk*... *whirrrrrrrr*... *hisssss*... every 5 seconds.

Some chairs sound like they‚Äôre grinding coffee beans in your ear.

A good massage shouldn‚Äôt sound like a factory.

Low-noise motors matter more than most people realize, especially if you're trying to relax or sleep after.

# 7. Stretch modes are 90% hype

‚ÄúYoga stretch‚Äù or ‚ÄúThai stretch‚Äù sounds cool, right?

Until the chair barely tilts your hips and you‚Äôre like, ‚Äúwas that it?‚Äù

Actual stretch requires leg extension, recline depth, and back arch control.

Most chairs just recline slightly and call it a day.

If you want real spine traction or decompression, double-check what ‚Äústretch‚Äù actually means on that model.

# TL;DR

* Rollers should dig, not just move around  
* Airbags only work if pressure + fit are right  
* Size compatibility is critical  
* Heat that doesn‚Äôt get hot = pointless  
* Auto modes are often overhyped ‚Äî customization matters  
* Noisy chairs kill the vibe  
* Most stretch modes are marketing fluff  ",1,1749052695.0,helpandreviews,0,1.0,False

It ended up stealing my mornings.

Not in the overhyped, Tiktok famous kind of way.

In the ""I actually used it every day for weeks and now can't go back"" kind of way.

I didn‚Äôt expect much from the EASPEARL 2025 when I first saw it online.

The price wasn‚Äôt outrageous like some $6,000 chairs.

But it wasn‚Äôt a budget one either.

Here‚Äôs what living with this full-body massage tank actually felt like.

# Setup & first use: low effort, high impact

It came mostly pre-assembled, which I appreciated.

Took maybe 15 minutes to set up. No tools needed beyond what came in the box.

The only annoying part was the size. This thing is heavy.

I‚Äôm talking nearly 200 lbs.

Get someone to help if you need to move it upstairs or through tight corners.

Once plugged in, it booted up fast. The auto-scan feature adjusted for my height (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô10‚Äù).

Didn‚Äôt have to fiddle with anything.

Just sat down, hit ""relax mode,"" and let it do its thing.

# What it actually feels like

First off, it‚Äôs not weak.

I‚Äôve tried chairs that feel like someone awkwardly tapping you with pool noodles.

This wasn‚Äôt that.

The 4D rollers *actually* dig into knots.

Shoulders, lower back, glutes ‚Äî it finds tension and works it.

Even the foot rollers felt intense (borderline too much at first).

Airbags? Strong.

Especially around the arms and calves. You can adjust intensity, which I did, because default was a little too firm.

Zero gravity recline genuinely takes pressure off the spine.

I didn‚Äôt expect to feel that light.

Heat zones in the back and calves added a nice layer ‚Äî not super hot, but warm enough to help recovery.

Once or twice I forgot to lower the intensity and it nearly launched my calves into orbit

# How i used it: daily routines that stuck

Started with post-workout recovery.

That became a habit fast.

Then night wind-down.

Then coffee-in-chair mornings on rest days.

Used the shortcut buttons 80% of the time.

Remote control was responsive. The app was fine, but honestly, I rarely used it.

There are 12 auto programs ‚Äî ""Stretch"" and ""Sleep"" were my favorites.

You can also fine-tune your own combo:

* roller depth  
* speed  
* pressure zones  
* heat level  

Felt more dialed in than chairs twice its price.

# Stuff that bugged me

It‚Äôs big. Not as in tall, but in footprint.

Even with the space-saving recline, it still hogs a good chunk of my living room.

The calf heat could be stronger. It‚Äôs there, but barely noticeable.

There‚Äôs no user memory.

So if my partner adjusts everything, I have to reset mine manually next time.

The Bluetooth speakers are just okay. Don‚Äôt expect sonos quality.

Some users (I didn‚Äôt) reported rare issues out of the box ‚Äî like stuck rollers or dead remotes.

Luckily, support seems responsive and covered under a 3-year warranty.

# Who this chair is for (and not for)

‚úÖ Want recovery after workouts? This works.

‚úÖ Long hours on your feet? You‚Äôll feel it in your calves and feet.

‚úÖ Stiff lower back or tech neck? It targets those areas well.

‚úÖ Need plug-and-play ease without spending $4k? This nails it.

But‚Ä¶

‚ùå If you‚Äôre under 5‚Äô2‚Äù, the airbags and rollers may miss key zones.

‚ùå If your space is tight, measure first. This ain‚Äôt compact.

‚ùå If you want deep stretch yoga modes or smart biometric features, you‚Äôll need to pay more elsewhere.

# So would i buy it again?

I paid $2,399, but it‚Äôs often on sale closer to $2,099.

At either price, it punches above its weight.

It doesn‚Äôt have ultra-premium bells and whistles, but for everyday relief, recovery, and relaxation?

Solid win.

This chair earned a permanent spot in my routine.

I'm a FTM with a 6 month old son. First I wanna say that there's absolutely nothing wrong with contact naps, co-sleeping, or bed sharing. Whatever works, works. 

I feel like I have screwed everything up with my son since day one. I feel like a crappy mom. I have no idea what I'm doing. I feel this way because of the stupid guidelines that are shoved down my throat. 

Please, please, please do not put me down because I feel so crappy about myself. So here's what's going on... 

I tried breastfeeding, but because he lost almost a pound in the hospital after birth I wanted to know exactly how much he was getting so I became an exclusive pumper. He was 6lbs4oz at birth and 5lbs7oz at 4 days old. He drank 2oz every 3hrs and I pumped when I could. The contact naps started because he cried every time he was put down so I could pump. 

He never had a designated bedtime because when I would try, he wouldn't go down for the night until after a 12am feeding. Once he was taking more ounces and my pump schedule was a little more spread out and he slept through the night, his last bottle of the day was 1030pm. That's been bedtime since he was 3 months old. I wake him up at 830am to have his first bottle and he eats every 3.5hrs from that point to ensure bedtime is the same time every night. 

I've always been told to follow hunger cues. Well, idk what they are because hunger cues are the same as sleepy cues and overall fussy cues. So I just stuck to a schedule rather than on demand. 

At night he sleeps in his bassinet next to our bed and he would sleep until I woke him up. Until a month ago he would wake up after 3-4 hours and wouldn't settle unless he was laying next to me. So that's what we've been doing. 

During the day, he falls asleep in my arms and I'm stuck there until nap time is over. Any time I try to put him in his crib, he wakes up. 

He's never had designated nap times because I just don't know what I'm doing. I don't know how else to explain it. Here's an idea of our day: 

8am - I wake up. Make coffee and get the days bottles ready.
830am - I get him up, changed, and a bottle.
9am - I put him down in his bouncer so I can pump for 20 mins. He's fine and happy. When I'm done, I'll put him on his play mat with toys so I can put my milk away, wash bottles, and eat breakfast. Usually by 945-10 He's getting fussy because he wants to be held. That's when he falls asleep in my arms. 
12pm - He gets another bottle.
1pm - I pump while he's in his bouncer and he's fussy the whole time. After this pump, I wash all my parts and by the end of it he's screaming. I hold him and sometimes he'll fall sleep, sometimes he just wants to play with me.
2pm - This time I know he's ready for a nap.
3pm - Husband is home from work
330pm - Husband feeds him
Between 4pm and 730pm, I pump twice, we've eaten dinner, and the baby has cat napped on Dad.
8pm - Husband goes to bed and I try to keep baby awake and occupied but he ends up fussy and sleeps. You'd think that this should be bed time, but I have to pump at 10 and he wakes up every damn time I pump at 10 and screams until he has a bottle in his mouth at 1030.
11pm - BED 

I want to add that he does get baby food during the day too, but never at designated times because I just don't know what I'm doing. 

I am not a bad mom. I just feel like one. I love my son. He's my rainbow baby after 2 losses. I'm 34 years old and I never thought I would have a baby. He's happy. He's healthy. He's thriving. I just want him to sleep in his crib. I want him to be able to fall asleep independently. 

Again, please don't put me down. Just give me some advice or encouragement that I'm not a complete failure. ",1,1749052576.0,beyondthebump,3,1.0,False

Back-to-back training. No bloating. And legit better sleep.

That was week 6. But let me back up.

I started using[ Transparent labs grassfed whey](https://www.transparentlabs.com/products/proteinseries-100-grass-fed-whey-protein-isolate/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=impact&utm_campaign=131624_Online%20Tracking%20Link&irgwc=1) eight weeks ago with zero expectations. 

No hype, no stacked shelf of supplements. Just one thing swapped: this whey instead of my usual blend.

Didn‚Äôt expect much. But a few things changed that made me keep reaching for the scoop.

Here‚Äôs what actually surprised me.

# 1. No stomach drama, ever

This is the first whey I‚Äôve taken where I didn‚Äôt feel tight or gassy after a shake.

No gut gurgles, no need to unbutton your pants post-shake.

It‚Äôs an isolate, which means almost no lactose, and it shows. Even when I mixed it with just water post-workout, it went down smooth.

For anyone who dreads the protein bloat, this stuff is different.

# 2. Clean energy and better sleep

Weird side effect? My sleep got better. Like fall-asleep-in-20-minutes kind of better.

I realized I wasn‚Äôt getting that crash from sugary shakes or blends packed with fillers. This has zero sugar, zero junk.

The result was more stable energy during the day and actual, deeper sleep at night.

Not saying this is a sleep aid, but it definitely didn‚Äôt mess with my recovery the way sweetened proteins used to.

# 3. No flavor fatigue

I rotate between French Vanilla and Dark Chocolate. Eight weeks in, still not sick of either.

They‚Äôre both natural-tasting. Not over-sweet. No weird aftertaste. You can mix them with milk, almond milk, water, oatmeal, even Greek yogurt.

Dark Chocolate especially hits that dessert craving without tasting fake. Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd become a protein pancake guy, but here we are.

# 4. Progress tracked faster

Not saying it‚Äôs a magic powder. But adding Transparent Labs Whey made me more consistent.

Why? Because I wasn‚Äôt skipping shakes. No bloating, no sugar crash, no weird taste meant I actually looked forward to post-lift protein.

And when you‚Äôre consistent, you recover better. Recovery = better lifts. Better lifts = progress.

That‚Äôs how it stacked up.

# 5. Sneaky kitchen weapon

This isn‚Äôt just for shakes. I started tossing a scoop into pancake mix, mug cakes, overnight oats, even coffee.

No weird clumping. It mixes better than most other isolates I‚Äôve tried.

Unflavored is great if you want to go full cooking mode. But honestly, French Vanilla worked fine even in stuff like protein cheesecake.

It‚Äôs become part of my daily intake, not just a workout thing.

# Stuff that didn‚Äôt wow me

Tried mixing it into hot coffee once. Bad idea. Turned into weird protein sludge. Don‚Äôt do that.

Also, $60 per tub stings the first time. You can get cheaper whey, but not this clean.

Still, no scoop has ever felt wasted‚Äîexcept that one in hot coffee.

# The takeaway

Transparent Labs Whey isn‚Äôt cheap. But it‚Äôs insanely clean, mixes perfectly, and made a noticeable difference in how I feel day to day.

Recovery improved. Cravings dropped. Workouts stayed consistent.

If you want a protein you don‚Äôt have to second-guess,[ this one‚Äôs worth it](https://www.transparentlabs.com/products/proteinseries-100-grass-fed-whey-protein-isolate/?utm_source=affiliate&utm_medium=impact&utm_campaign=131624_Online%20Tracking%20Link&irgwc=1).

1l390mw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mindfulnesschallenges/comments/1l390mw/the_power_of_connection/,The Power of Connection,"### Why Every Woman Needs Her Own Circle of Support

As we journey through life, the importance of connection becomes increasingly clear. For women especially, cultivating relationships that are free from jealousy and competition is vital. The older I get, the more I realize that having a close ally who truly sees and celebrates your magic can profoundly impact our sense of self-worth, purpose, and resilience. This bond goes beyond friendship; it evolves into a sanctuary of authenticity, love, support, and positive energy.

#### The Essence of Female Connection

In a world that often pits women against each other in a race for validation‚Äîwhether in career achievements, beauty standards, or social status‚Äîit's imperative to foster relationships grounded in mutual respect and understanding. This support system is not about accolades or comparisons; instead, it's about recognizing and celebrating each other‚Äôs unique qualities and journeys. When a woman feels truly seen by another, it creates a bond that reinforces her sense of identity and empowers her to embrace her authenticity.

#### Authenticity Over Competition

Imagine a world where women recognize that their worth is not diminished by the accomplishments of others. Authentic connections are built on encouragement and admiration rather than rivalry. When a woman says, ""I've got you,"" it signals a safe space where you can truly be yourself‚Äîwithout the fear of judgment. These relationships thrive on the foundation of trust, allowing us to share our aspirations, fears, and vulnerabilities openly. Having someone who believes in you without reservation can be a transformative experience that catalyzes personal growth.

#### Love as a Catalyst for Empowerment

Support comes in many forms‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs a simple text checking in on you, a spontaneous coffee date to lighten your mood, or words of encouragement when you're facing self-doubt. Love breeds empowerment. When women uplift each other, they create a ripple effect that transcends individual lives, influencing families, communities, and ultimately, society as a whole. By celebrating our successes and providing solace during our challenges, we contribute to a culture where every woman feels valued and powerful in her own right.

#### Positive Vibes and Building Each Other Up

In our fast-paced, often challenging world, infusing our relationships with positive vibes becomes crucial. This doesn‚Äôt mean ignoring negativity or adversity; rather, it involves choosing to focus on solutions and gratitude together. Acknowledging and lifting each other through hard times while also rejoicing in each other's wins creates an environment rich in positivity and growth. The simple act of acknowledging each other's strengths can significantly impact self-esteem and resilience.

#### Rooting for Each Other

The phrase ‚ÄúI see you‚Äù resonates deeply. It represents recognition and validation. When we actively support one another, it fosters a sense of belonging‚Äîa reminder that we are not alone in our journeys. We may each walk our paths, but having someone in your corner makes all the difference. ""I'm rooting for you, always"" is a powerful sentiment that emphasizes communal strength over individual excellence.

#### Conclusion

As we navigate the complexities of life, the relationships we cultivate hold tremendous power. Creating and maintaining supportive, authentic connections with other women is not just beneficial; it is essential. We each possess a unique magic that deserves to be acknowledged, celebrated, and supported. The more we can lift each other up, the more empowered and enriched we become.

So, let us strive to be that woman for someone else‚Äîone who sees, appreciates, and celebrates the essence of what makes another shine. In doing so, we not only validate their magic but also create a lasting legacy of love and support that can change lives, including our own. Believe in your power, and understand that as you rise, you are doing so with a thriving community by your side.

1l38z0r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l38z0r,Hario Switch + Mugen,"I recently added to my collection (Switch with 02 and 01 glass cones) this ceramic Hario Mugen, while I‚Äôm waiting to receive my other purchase: a Tarachine / Conical 30 dripper.

I bought this dripper because I brew with small doses (around 10-12 gr) and the 02 cone was too tall for such a small coffee bed, hence why I ‚Äúdowngraded‚Äù to the 01 glass cone, to be able to pour close to the coffee bed without agitating too much when in full V60 mode, and this Mugen having a slower flow is also waaay more forgiving than the 02 cone despite being the same size. Also because of the different taste profile.

With the glass V60 cones the overall cup was more alive and, again, tridimensional because I could feel the flavours around my mouth and palate, they were more separate even despite the hybrid infusion brew, probably the cup was even a bit sweeter but probably this is due to some needed tweak for brewing with the Mugen (slower flow calls for coarser grind or lower temp).

I‚Äôm impressed, I appreciated the difference and I can‚Äôt wait to try it with other coffees until I can test the Tarachine to see how the Mugen compares at low doses.

If you ask me, between the plastic and ceramic Mugen it‚Äôs a no brainier: get the latter. The black Switch + white Mugen is sexy.

Same coffee, same method and same recipe:  David Guevara Armijos Natural by Nero Scuro, 10 gr @ 1:15, water at 92¬∫C, 85 clicks on my Kingrinder K6, Cafec Abaca filter and the Switch recipe from The Coffee Chronicler optimised for a sweet profile.

- 00:00 [VALVE OPEN] pour 50% of the total water (75 gr) in circular motion
- 00:25 [VALVE CLOSE] pour the rest of the water and let the coffee steep 
- 02:00 [VALVE OPEN] drain and serve

Compared to the cup obtained with the glass cones, the smell is fruity and more focused, the same is true for the first sips with the coffee at around 60¬∫C where I see the biggest difference between these brewers: the pineapple acidity is juicy and sharp, balanced and yet it hits straight into your mouth rather than being silky and ‚Äútridimensional‚Äù (pass me this term lmao), the body is a bit fuller but at this temperature the flavours are still dominated by the acidity. I can see that the cup profile has less separated notes, but all of them are there.

As the coffee chills down to my favourite zone (30¬∫C and less), the acidity rebalances and gets a touch muted so that the sweetness and the caramel, raisins and dark dried fruits (figs, dates) can emerge in a sequential texture, leaving a pleasant aftertaste which stays with me for some time.",1,1749052021.0,pourover,2,0.67,False
1l38yf9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l38yf9,Help! (Again) Wobbly Coffee table!,"Hi Dad(s) of the internet. I have asked before for your wisdom, and I am seeking assistance again.

I was gifted a Eva Zeisel coffee table that I am in love with, but she is terribly wobbly. I bought some wooden dowel pins (3/8‚Äù) hoping I could better stabilize the table by replacing the (what I thought were) missing ones at the base that connect the legs together. I‚Äôve flipped her over and found out that she has metal support pins and is held in place by something called a ‚Äúzip bolt‚Äù? I have never encountered these before. Is there a way for me to tighten them?

I have looked up the table online and have seen sellers separate the legs for easy shipping and assembly for their buyer upon arrival‚Äî so it seems it can be done‚Ä¶ but I think the assembly/hardware of the online seller‚Äôs table is different from mine. The online table seems to have similar metal slots like a bed frame while mine has metal posts/dowels.

The first two photos are from an online seller of the same table assembled and disassembled (I don‚Äôt have the instructions). The rest are of the bottom of the table in my living room. The last photo is of a handful of tools mom left me as a starter set for my big city move. (‚ÄúPiglet‚Äôs big adventure‚Äù vibe) I have a feeling I may need to make a hardware store run or ask a night neighbor to borrow a tool or two.

Please advise.

TLDR: wobbly table with supporting ‚Äúzip bolt‚Äù with missing original hardware. Can I use wooden dowels to replace the missing hardware? How do I not destroy my ‚Äúnew to me‚Äù coffee table when I disassemble it for repairs and future moves?

Writing this while crying over my morning coffee lmao, happy wednesday! 

I (early 20sF) have been living with severe chronic back pain since I was 11 years old, after suffering two pretty intense compression fractures of my T10 and T12 vertebrae- to make it even better, the day after I was cleared to take off my back brace I re-fractured both vertebrae, starting all over again. From stubbornness, depression, and the reality that I did not want to live with more back problems, I did not go to the doctor for over a month. This, evidently, caused many problems that I still deal with to this day from not stabilizing my spine immediately after those re-fractures. Shmorl's nodes, misaligned vertebrae and discs, subluxations, pinched nerves, spinal cord injury, literally everything you can think of. So here we are now.

It has caused me to be incredibly irritated, fatigued, depressed, and overall resentful of the life I could be living. I often get jealous of my friends because of how much they can do but I can't. I can't stand for over 5 minutes without severe pain in my lower back which eventually caused severe leg pain, then tingles, then my legs just fail me and I fall. I can't sit or do much activity for over 5 minutes or I'm in the same way. Any flight over 2 hours becomes excruciating. It is exhausting. I feel it. Constantly.

I have tried physical therapy, I have done everything that I can myself to help this. I ruined the lining of my stomach in high school by taking too much ibuprofen trying to calm this pain.

I want to know if anyone has dealt with something similar to this at a young age. Ever since 6th grade I was told I would probably be in a wheelchair as an adult and not become an Olympic track runner like I wanted to. I do not remember a time where I wasn't in constant pain. I wake up to my legs feeling numb and some days I can't walk and I just don't go to class. I have left class early crying because my legs and back were hurting me so intensely. But I can't do that once I get a regular job, which leads me to another question- How do you guys with these conditions to the adult 9-5 life? I am dreading it.

I recently decided to go get updated imaging and have a lumbar MRI next week. I may have to get surgery (worst case because the recovery might make me lose it), and the conservative options are periodic and expensive steroid injections, epidurals, or other therapies that I probably can't afford after I leave my parents health insurance (which I am so blessed to be on).

I just don't know what to do. What will my life look like? I am so tired, and I am so young. Please tell me there is something to look forward to.",0,1749051850.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

By now you know, 270lbs 5 10 yadda yadda so I am cutting out soda and little things to start losing some of the weight. I cant go full on or I'll burn out and quit. Just had a terrible workout. I added weight to all my exercises and it went pretty badly. Did 20kg lying hamstring curls no problem, tried a plank and just felt nothing in the abs even after doing three attempts for 30-45 seconds. Then did lunges with 15kg dumbells either side and just couldn't focus or do them properly so I went down to 12.5kg instead and just clumsily did them until I could say ""yeah done it"". Then did goblet squats and just couldn't be bothered so again lazily did the sets at a lighter weight than usual. Then did my calf raises with a much lower weight barbell but still felt a good burn after. 

I feel burnt out, not because I dont want to keep working out. But because I just feel devoid of any energy. All I had to eat was my protein shake, two black coffees, an orange and a cheese sandwich. I just want to go get a mcdouble or something. It's only been two days and I'm already on the losing side.

Steel hull creaked, ice cracked under its prow, and wind howled against the portholes like wolves testing the walls.

Wrench stood on deck, wrapped in a parka two sizes too small, arms crossed like he was conserving heat by sheer attitude.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt we parachute in like normal lunatics?‚Äù he grumbled, teeth chattering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather fall through the clouds at terminal velocity than freeze off the better part of my anatomy on this floating tin can.‚Äù

Cole adjusted the strap of his duffel and scanned the endless white horizon. ‚ÄúYou said you wanted to see the Northern Lights.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say I wanted to marry them. This is punishment. This is nature‚Äôs restraining order.‚Äù

A gust of frigid air slammed them both. Wrench recoiled like he'd been slapped. ‚ÄúYou know what this weather feels like?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs hangover.‚Äù

Cole gave him a sidelong look. ‚ÄúYou're making friends already.‚Äù

Wrench stomped off, muttering something about hugging an engine block for warmth.

Below deck, the rumble of the engines began to stutter. One moment it was steady. The next‚Äîsilence, then a cough, then another silence longer than the first.

The *Svalbard Hawk* listed slightly as if even the icebreaker didn‚Äôt trust its own footing.

Within minutes, the captain‚Äîa short, broad-shouldered Swede named Lindholm‚Äîfound them in the galley. ‚ÄúWe have a situation,‚Äù he said, brows knitted under his wool cap. ‚ÄúStarboard turbine just quit. No cause. No warning. Diagnostics say it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Cole frowned. ‚ÄúHow long to get it running?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Lindholm said. ‚ÄúWe have engineers. Good ones. But they‚Äôre confused. That worries me.‚Äù

Wrench, of course, had vanished.

Cole followed the captain through the tight corridors to the engine room, where a small group of mechanics were pacing and shrugging in accented frustration. A hatch creaked open from behind one of the panels.

Out popped Wrench, streaked with grease, holding what looked like a repurposed coffee tin, some wire, and a pair of bolt cutters.

‚ÄúFound the problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell, a few problems. But the one that mattered was a frozen bypass regulator. I re-routed it using parts from the espresso machine and a coat hanger.‚Äù

The captain blinked. ‚ÄúYou did... what?‚Äù

Wrench grinned. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll purr now. Though you may want to skip coffee for the rest of the trip.‚Äù

Cole just shook his head, amused. ‚ÄúEvery time I think you can‚Äôt get stranger, you prove me wrong.‚Äù

Wrench shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a man of many disappointments. And miracles.‚Äù

The engine room roared back to life, a mechanical heartbeat returning from the dead. The vibration traveled up the walls and through the deck like a sigh of relief.

The captain turned to Cole, clearly unnerved but impressed. ‚ÄúWhat exactly does your organization *do*, Mr. Striker?‚Äù

Cole met his gaze calmly. ‚ÄúEnvironmental logistics. Ice research.‚Äù

Lindholm didn‚Äôt buy it, but didn‚Äôt press. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make up lost time. Two hours to the drop point.‚Äù









The Arctic sun hung low, casting a blue-gold shimmer across the ice as the *Svalbard Hawk* carved its path between jagged floes. In the distance, a cluster of prefabricated structures came into view‚Äîpale against the snow, antennas jutting like skeletal fingers into the sky.

Evelyn Shaw‚Äôs outpost.

Cole pulled on his cold-weather gear, checked his Walther, and slung his duffel over one shoulder. Wrench zipped up his jacket, still complaining.

‚ÄúThis woman better have a wood stove and cocoa,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIf I have to sleep in a metal box while being haunted by ghost glaciers, I‚Äôm quitting. Again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou quit every time,‚Äù Cole said, descending the gangplank.

‚ÄúThis time I mean it.‚Äù

As they disembarked, the wind picked up, whispering secrets across the tundra.

The *Svalbard Hawk* pulled away with a low groan, disappearing into a veil of drifting snow. The wind whipped across the ice shelf in short, angry gusts, tugging at coat seams and snapping at exposed skin like a feral dog. Overhead, the clouds hung low and leaden, smothering the horizon in a slate-gray gloom.

The outpost sat on a rise of fractured ice and permafrost, a patchwork of weather-worn prefabs connected by metal walkways and thermal-insulated tubing. Solar panels dusted with frost tilted listlessly toward the sky, and a lonely radar dish rotated with arthritic slowness. A single Norwegian flag flapped half-heartedly on a crooked pole, its edges frayed to string.

Lights flickered in one of the modules‚Äînot in rhythm, but in a slow, pulsing pattern. Like breathing.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs comforting,‚Äù Wrench muttered.

The main door hissed open before they could knock. A figure stood silhouetted in the vestibule, bundled in a cold-weather parka with the hood down, revealing a shock of red hair pulled into a loose ponytail and pale skin tinged with the faintest blush from the cold.

Dr. Evelyn Shaw.

‚ÄúStriker, I assume?‚Äù she said, her voice clipped and dry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

Cole nodded. ‚ÄúTurbine issues. He fixed it with espresso parts,‚Äù he said, gesturing to Wrench.

Wrench gave a mock bow. ‚ÄúYour caffeine sacrifice saved humanity.‚Äù

Evelyn‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly, appraising Wrench, then Cole, then their gear. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from the Department of Polar Research.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a sub-contracted logistics team,‚Äù Cole replied smoothly. ‚ÄúSpecial projects.‚Äù

Her expression said she didn‚Äôt buy it, but she stepped aside and waved them in. ‚ÄúFine. But if either of you ruins my snowpack data, I‚Äôll have your spleens.‚Äù

Inside, the outpost was warmer but not cozy. The place smelled like old coffee, stale air and rusted metal. Maps and seismographic charts were pinned to the walls alongside photographs of glacial cross-sections and drone captures. A whiteboard listed sensor logs, most with check marks beside them‚Äîbut one column was circled in red: Unit 7 ‚Äì Offline, Coordinates: UNKNOWN.

As they stepped into the operations module, Evelyn peeled off her gloves and gestured toward a live feed of seismic activity on a large screen. It was subtle, but there: a rhythmic, low-frequency pulse from deep beneath the ice. Almost too regular to be natural.

‚ÄúIt started four days ago,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe thought it was glacial creep, but then one of our remote probes‚Äîunit seven‚Äîwent offline. No signal. No GPS. Just gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould be a collapse,‚Äù Cole said.

‚ÄúExcept that before it vanished, its sensors recorded a heat bloom,‚Äù she said, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúThirty degrees Celsius. Under a kilometer of ice.‚Äù

Wrench let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not glacial. That‚Äôs... something else.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we can help you figure that out Doc.‚Äù Cole stated.

Shaw flicked her eyes between the two men. ‚ÄúI highly doubt you have the scientific knowledge to help in this research. You two look like you are more well suited in a bar brawl on a navy base.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy intimate knowledge may surprise you.‚Äù Cole quipped with a hint of a wry smile.

I'll just call her Sister, as I've forgotten her name anyway. This story in particular has always stuck with me. This took place in somewhere between 2017 and 2019.

Sister was driving on an isolated, rural road alone at night, partly under the influence (very mildly). It was pretty dark- she was getting back from a party and going back to her apartment. While driving, a dishevelled woman was limping on the side of a dirt road, flagging her down. Sister was extremely wary at first and slowed down for a moment, but the woman seemed orderly, calm, polite, and very nice. Sister offered her to sit in the front.

As soon as she got in, Sister offered the hitchhiker a blanket and her phone to call whoever she needed. The hitchhiker just had an unnervingly calm face and accepted it, before stating she wanted to go to a point on the GPS that was in the middle of a forest. This creeped out Sister, but being an introvert, she decided that it was too late to back out and resolved that ""if they tried to attack, she could defend herself."" As they started driving, the hitchhiker kept staring at Sister. Sister, got a bit unnerved by it after a while. Trying to break the awkwardness, she offered some McDonald's coffee. It was cold by then, but she was obviously trying to be nice. The hitchhiker nodded, tilting their head and smiling a bit. ""Thank you,"" she murmured in a monotonous voice.

Sister kept driving for a while, before the hitchhiker said loud and clear, ""You're a nice woman. You don't deserve what I'm about to do to you."" The hitchhiker fiddled with something in their pocket, before pausing as Sister began to cry. ""Pull over,"" the hitchhiker ordered. When Sister did, the hitchhiker said, ""I don't want to do this to you You shouldn't pick up hitchhikers. Keep driving.""

After Sister complied, the hitchhiker ordered her to a new location on a different deserted road. After about ten miles of driving, the hitchhiker opened the car door and left.

This story is still the leading reason why I refuse to accept any hitchhikers whatsoever. Creepy.",1,1749051715.0,stories,0,1.0,False

We were already short staffed and one of the managers was busy dealing with a customer, so I was running back and forth between drive through and making drinks until she got back.

Two of our most obnoxious regulars, a middle aged man and his teenage daughter, come through the drive through. The daughter orders a venti summer berry lemonade with light ice. Before I can even say anything, she repeats, ‚ÄúWith light ice. With light ice. With light ice. With light ice.‚Äù Like‚Ä¶I heard you the first time? And the second, third, and fourth??

Her father orders a small iced coffee with ‚Äúfive and a half liquid sugars‚Äù and cream. She orders and sandwich, and he orders a cookie. Fine.

So I make the drinks and run back to the window. As I‚Äôm handing the summer berry lemonade out the window, the father asks in a weirdly condescending voice, ‚ÄúIs that a rainbow? Is it? Oh wow, I wonder what that‚Äôs about.‚Äù

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The *Svalbard Hawk* groaned through the Arctic chop like an old man with arthritis and somewhere better to be. Steel hull creaked, ice cracked under its prow, and wind howled against the portholes like wolves testing the walls.

Wrench stood on deck, wrapped in a parka two sizes too small, arms crossed like he was conserving heat by sheer attitude.

‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt we parachute in like normal lunatics?‚Äù he grumbled, teeth chattering. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather fall through the clouds at terminal velocity than freeze off the better part of my anatomy on this floating tin can.‚Äù

Cole adjusted the strap of his duffel and scanned the endless white horizon. ‚ÄúYou said you wanted to see the Northern Lights.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say I wanted to marry them. This is punishment. This is nature‚Äôs restraining order.‚Äù

A gust of frigid air slammed them both. Wrench recoiled like he'd been slapped. ‚ÄúYou know what this weather feels like?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCanada‚Äôs hangover.‚Äù

Cole gave him a sidelong look. ‚ÄúYou're making friends already.‚Äù

Wrench stomped off, muttering something about hugging an engine block for warmth.

Below deck, the rumble of the engines began to stutter. One moment it was steady. The next‚Äîsilence, then a cough, then another silence longer than the first.

The *Svalbard Hawk* listed slightly as if even the icebreaker didn‚Äôt trust its own footing.

Within minutes, the captain‚Äîa short, broad-shouldered Swede named Lindholm‚Äîfound them in the galley. ‚ÄúWe have a situation,‚Äù he said, brows knitted under his wool cap. ‚ÄúStarboard turbine just quit. No cause. No warning. Diagnostics say it‚Äôs fine.‚Äù

Cole frowned. ‚ÄúHow long to get it running?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Lindholm said. ‚ÄúWe have engineers. Good ones. But they‚Äôre confused. That worries me.‚Äù

Wrench, of course, had vanished.

Cole followed the captain through the tight corridors to the engine room, where a small group of mechanics were pacing and shrugging in accented frustration. A hatch creaked open from behind one of the panels.

Out popped Wrench, streaked with grease, holding what looked like a repurposed coffee tin, some wire, and a pair of bolt cutters.

‚ÄúFound the problem,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWell, a few problems. But the one that mattered was a frozen bypass regulator. I re-routed it using parts from the espresso machine and a coat hanger.‚Äù

The captain blinked. ‚ÄúYou did... what?‚Äù

Wrench grinned. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll purr now. Though you may want to skip coffee for the rest of the trip.‚Äù

Cole just shook his head, amused. ‚ÄúEvery time I think you can‚Äôt get stranger, you prove me wrong.‚Äù

Wrench shrugged. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a man of many disappointments. And miracles.‚Äù

The engine room roared back to life, a mechanical heartbeat returning from the dead. The vibration traveled up the walls and through the deck like a sigh of relief.

The captain turned to Cole, clearly unnerved but impressed. ‚ÄúWhat exactly does your organization *do*, Mr. Striker?‚Äù

Cole met his gaze calmly. ‚ÄúEnvironmental logistics. Ice research.‚Äù

Lindholm didn‚Äôt buy it, but didn‚Äôt press. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make up lost time. Two hours to the drop point.‚Äù









The Arctic sun hung low, casting a blue-gold shimmer across the ice as the *Svalbard Hawk* carved its path between jagged floes. In the distance, a cluster of prefabricated structures came into view‚Äîpale against the snow, antennas jutting like skeletal fingers into the sky.

Evelyn Shaw‚Äôs outpost.

Cole pulled on his cold-weather gear, checked his Walther, and slung his duffel over one shoulder. Wrench zipped up his jacket, still complaining.

‚ÄúThis woman better have a wood stove and cocoa,‚Äù he muttered. ‚ÄúIf I have to sleep in a metal box while being haunted by ghost glaciers, I‚Äôm quitting. Again.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou quit every time,‚Äù Cole said, descending the gangplank.

‚ÄúThis time I mean it.‚Äù

As they disembarked, the wind picked up, whispering secrets across the tundra.

The *Svalbard Hawk* pulled away with a low groan, disappearing into a veil of drifting snow. The wind whipped across the ice shelf in short, angry gusts, tugging at coat seams and snapping at exposed skin like a feral dog. Overhead, the clouds hung low and leaden, smothering the horizon in a slate-gray gloom.

The outpost sat on a rise of fractured ice and permafrost, a patchwork of weather-worn prefabs connected by metal walkways and thermal-insulated tubing. Solar panels dusted with frost tilted listlessly toward the sky, and a lonely radar dish rotated with arthritic slowness. A single Norwegian flag flapped half-heartedly on a crooked pole, its edges frayed to string.

Lights flickered in one of the modules‚Äînot in rhythm, but in a slow, pulsing pattern. Like breathing.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs comforting,‚Äù Wrench muttered.

The main door hissed open before they could knock. A figure stood silhouetted in the vestibule, bundled in a cold-weather parka with the hood down, revealing a shock of red hair pulled into a loose ponytail and pale skin tinged with the faintest blush from the cold.

Dr. Evelyn Shaw.

‚ÄúStriker, I assume?‚Äù she said, her voice clipped and dry. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre late.‚Äù

Cole nodded. ‚ÄúTurbine issues. He fixed it with espresso parts,‚Äù he said, gesturing to Wrench.

Wrench gave a mock bow. ‚ÄúYour caffeine sacrifice saved humanity.‚Äù

Evelyn‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly, appraising Wrench, then Cole, then their gear. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not from the Department of Polar Research.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a sub-contracted logistics team,‚Äù Cole replied smoothly. ‚ÄúSpecial projects.‚Äù

Her expression said she didn‚Äôt buy it, but she stepped aside and waved them in. ‚ÄúFine. But if either of you ruins my snowpack data, I‚Äôll have your spleens.‚Äù

Inside, the outpost was warmer but not cozy. The place smelled like old coffee, stale air and rusted metal. Maps and seismographic charts were pinned to the walls alongside photographs of glacial cross-sections and drone captures. A whiteboard listed sensor logs, most with check marks beside them‚Äîbut one column was circled in red: Unit 7 ‚Äì Offline, Coordinates: UNKNOWN.

As they stepped into the operations module, Evelyn peeled off her gloves and gestured toward a live feed of seismic activity on a large screen. It was subtle, but there: a rhythmic, low-frequency pulse from deep beneath the ice. Almost too regular to be natural.

‚ÄúIt started four days ago,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe thought it was glacial creep, but then one of our remote probes‚Äîunit seven‚Äîwent offline. No signal. No GPS. Just gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúCould be a collapse,‚Äù Cole said.

‚ÄúExcept that before it vanished, its sensors recorded a heat bloom,‚Äù she said, eyes narrowing. ‚ÄúThirty degrees Celsius. Under a kilometer of ice.‚Äù

Wrench let out a low whistle. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not glacial. That‚Äôs... something else.‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe we can help you figure that out Doc.‚Äù Cole stated.

Shaw flicked her eyes between the two men. ‚ÄúI highly doubt you have the scientific knowledge to help in this research. You two look like you are more well suited in a bar brawl on a navy base.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy intimate knowledge may surprise you.‚Äù Cole quipped with a hint of a wry smile.

Shaw frowned slightly and replied with a dry ‚ÄúFollow me gentlemen.‚Äù

They passed a narrow hallway lined with metal lockers and gear. One locker door was open‚Äîinside hung a parka, unused. A name tag read H. Olsson.

Hey, I've made the decision to try going back into playing physical games as part of my digital minimalism journey. I found out that I would be alright doing some online shopping through [itch.io](http://itch.io) (usually pronounced¬†*itchy-o*, with a chuckle). I think it would also be great to support independent online creators putting themselves out there.

The physical games from¬†[itch.io](http://itch.io/) are downloadable as PDFs that print out and carry with you in a backpack or something. It can get really creative and engaging, and many games are sold at a name-your-price model so you can start a collection with a rather modest sum.

I got a few and will print them out and try them with some friends whenever I have free time (sorry, too lazy to post links--just search):

My schedule really didn't allow for a new hobby.  I am now retired and looking for a new setup (I will keep the Jura in another room as a backup and for the iced macchiatos).  

I am the only coffee drinker in the house, but I am active (4-5/day and mainly milk drinks, though I like straight espresso as well).  

I am looking at the Lelit Mara X and the Rancilio Silvia Pro X.  I don't think I really need a dual boiler, but don't want to be short sided either.  I am 50/50 on pre-infusion vs flow control? Does one negate the other?

I am looking to pair this with the DF64 V2 grinder.  Looks like the 64mm burrs, though flat, would still be good for milk drinks.  Is that correct?

Any feedback is appreciated.  Alternative recommendations?  Would like to stay under $2500 for both machine and grinder.

Late nights, too much coffee, endless mixing tweaks,  the usual. I was convinced it would make waves, maybe not big ones, but *something*.

I released it with a full rollout plan: teaser clips, social posts, even handmade cover art. And then, almost nothing.

A few listens. A couple of supportive friends. Radio silence everywhere else.

At first, it stung. But after sitting with it, I realized I was promoting something I hadn't fully grown into yet. I was still finding my sound, still learning how to tell *my* story instead of imitating someone else's.

So instead of pushing the EP harder, I took a step back. I started making music just for me again. I experimented. I collaborated. I listened more than I posted.

That failed release? It became my foundation. Now, the music I‚Äôm working on feels *real*. Not polished to perfection, but *honest,* and that‚Äôs what people are responding to.

Just a reminder: your music journey isn‚Äôt defined by one post, one track, or one quiet drop. It‚Äôs all part of it.

1l38hyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1l38hyc/i_think_my_boomer_coworker_has_been_trying_to/,"I think my boomer coworker has been trying to sabotage me, and I'm getting payback just by doing my job.","TLDR: my boomer coworker is feeling the heat from upper management and trying to drag me down with her, but it's backfiring. 

My (35f) boomer coworker (60's/f) has a habit of trying to get me to slack off at work. For context, we both work remote and she's been getting in trouble lately with our higher-ups for poor work quality, claiming it's discrimination because I'm not getting in trouble, only her. But my work is solid and hers is shaky at best all the time. 

Here is a quick example: I was running slides for an important meeting and right as the meeting started we had a massive storm blow through our area. I chatted her quickly just as an FYI saying ""Hey, can you just have the slide deck up and ready in case I lose power?"" She agreed. The storm caused no issues, I finished running the slide deck, but, the meeting went over a bit and we were late for a meeting right afterwards. She calls me wanting to talk about the first meeting, and I tell her we can discuss it later since we're late for the next meeting. She immediately tries to get me to just bail on the meeting saying ""Well I mean who's to say you didn't lose internet because of the storm and can't go to the meeting?"" And I kept saying well I didn't lose internet so I'm going to go grab a cup of coffee and jump into this meeting, but she doubled down and said ""Well I think I must have got your storm too so maybe my internet went out too so I guess we're both missing this meeting."" And I just hung up with her, got my coffee and went into the meeting and she was there.  I found it weird that she was trying so hard to get me to skip it by acting like she was going to skip it, but she went anyway? 

Which leads me to the point of this post. We are working on a fairly large report together, we split everything and work on different sections. Once we get the data, we have 2 weeks to complete the report. This coworker would constantly make comments about how much longer it was going to take ""us"" to finish the tasks, even though there was nothing causing us to fall behind. By Friday afternoon, I was ready to send off my section of the report to be reviewed by our boss. I had told my coworker that I would probably wait until Monday to send it, so it doesn't get buried in the boss' inbox. She told me her stuff wasn't going to be ready until Wednesday. 

So Monday comes and I send my stuff over to my boss for review. My boomer coworker immediately calls me with an attitude going ""Yeah I'm just checking on you to see if everything is good in your neighborhood because we normally send our stuff at the same time."" I just told her that my stuff was ready and it doesn't make sense for me to sit on it for two days waiting for her stuff before sending mine. The two items are in no way dependent on each other, completely separate sections, and it's never been a policy that we have to send our stuff to our boss at the same time. Well suddenly she was able to get her stuff out that same day and not Wednesday, so it just feels like she's mad I did it first? 

I have now officially finished all my tasks for this report and submitted everything up for review, while she's scrambling to get hers done, claiming she's trying to submit them but her files are too big and she's working with IT to fix the problem. (I believe this is just a blatant lie, her file sizes are smaller than mine and I had no issues sending them.)

I could list dozens of other examples, but overall it just seems like she's been getting a lot of heat from upper management to perform better, and instead of just performing better, she's trying to bring me down and lower the bar for what the expectation is. Turns out just doing the bare minimum for my job is enough to make her look bad, and the more she tries to sabotage me, the more it makes me want to go above and beyond to really highlight her incompetence.

I share more about connection, work, focus, progress, engagement with others, being tired for the right reasons, a ""good tired,"" as my grandfather used to say, practicing spiritual principles, etc. It's refreshing to be able to ""just be,"" at least most of the time anyway, extricated from the phoniness and prideful banter, or on the other end of that ill spectrum - the self-flagellation, gas-on-the-fire of guilt and shame verbiage, that by definition attaches itself to addictive gambling. While I think the language change is more a product of my journey of not gambling and of leaning into a new way of life, rather than a cause of the change, I do think that a little bit of chicken-and-egg does occur - that the practice of using new words also helps continue reinforcing a life based on truth, down-to-earthness, and simplicity, so maybe it's a good idea to try some new forms of communication and expression, less ""I won this, then I lost that, but then I stopped, then I went back...,"" and more about having coffee this morning over reading some gratitude shares on am email chain before getting to work.

I started my weight loss journey, September 2024 and I was 345 pounds. I started off by doing keto and lost 30 pounds. Then my doctor introduced me to the glp-1 Zepbound and I started that March 2025 as of today I am 300 pounds.  I‚Äôve taken a huge interest in biohacking because aside from my obesity, I have trouble falling asleep and trouble staying asleep; back in 2017 I was diagnosed with sleep apnea but when I did a recent sleep study January 2025 I was told I don‚Äôt have sleep apnea so I‚Äôm kind of still figuring that part out. I‚Äôm also pre diabetic, low energy and I always feel foggy.

Aside from my Zepbound, 2 weeks ago i started the following routine and stack. Would love your opinion and any advice that can help me improve.

1l381z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1l381z0/singularly_unique_starbucks_experience/,Singularly Unique Starbucks Experience,"Howdy, if you're reading, please bear in mind that I have been a Starbucks customer for over thirty years, and I have been to over 20,200 stores in 71 countries, and yet I have never had an experience like this morning, which probably means that there was something going on with that partner, not me.

One root cause of this experience is the glut of drive-thru/walk-up/Pickup stores that Starbucks has been increasingly building throughout the United States. These stores are fine if you just want a standard order to go, with no customisation, and you don't care whether it is prepared correctly, rung up correctly, or about using your personal cup or any other enœâironmental concerns. However, if you actually need to communicate some instructions to the barista, or werify that the order was rung up correctly or is being prepared correctly, this design, especially the drive-thru or walk-up design, makes it really difficult for customers to catch mistakes.

Another root cause is the new Customer Only policy which was never clarified to account for customers who make a purchase at a store with no seating but need a lobby. Most partners, superœâisors, managers, and district managers would probably be reasonable and say that of course if a customer bought a coffee at a drive-thru/walk-up store but needs to sit down or use the washroom at a different store, they can do so, but unfortunately their are some partners who will insist that a customer MUST purchase at THAT store.

Okay, so the next store on my not wisited list was in Lewes, DE, and because the next store after that is hours away, I called ahead to see if they had seating (because I need to sit down and work for a few hours). I was told that, no, it was drive-thru/walk-up only, which meant I'd need to take my coffee to an older store, a few minutes away in Rehoboth Beach. I hoped that the superœâisor or manager at that store would be reasonable, but I wanted to prepare ahead of time.

When I arrived in Lewes, I asked if the manager was there, because if the manager called over to Rehoboth and explained that I had indeed bought a coffee, whoever was in charge over there would be likely to let me sit down. This is where things started to go off the rails. The partner immediately walked off to go get the assistant manager, but I did not want that yet. I could see that there were a few cars in the drive-thru, and I did not want the ASM wasting their time waiting for me to place my order. However, the partner ignored me and brought the ASM over to me, and I then had to explain that I wasn't ready yet, that I didn't want to waste his time while the store was busy.

He returned to working on orders, and I began placing my order for a short coffee. At that point, I became aware of something else that was unusual and awkward about that particular store, that, unlike MOST drive-thru/walk-up only store, the walk-up window DID NOT have a counter where a customer could set things down, like a personal cup, a water cup, a phone, etc. For that reason, I still had my reusable water cup in my hand, and the partner noticed and asked if I wanted anything else. I replied that I wanted to get my coffee order completed and ask for water later.

Now, at standard stores, with lobbies and seating, I would have set my water cup down at a table, ordered my coffee, and then while it was brewing (Vertica brew typically takes about 30 seconds), I would have gone back to my table to get the cup and asked the barista for some water. This has worked fine literally hundreds of times, but that particular barista insisted that they had to enter both the coffee and the water into the  register at the same time.

I tried to explain that I preferred to do things one at a time at these walk-up only stores because otherwise baristas were likely to make a mistake, which happens routinely. A common mistake, for example, is that baristas will be in such a rush that they will pull the drip coffee sticker and prepare it in a paper cup, ignoring the reusable cup, or they will pull the water sticker and grab a big ole plastic cup for the water, which is just horrible.

I've given this same explanation to dozens of baristas at these walk-up only stores, and while some may roll their eyes, they don't make an issue of it. This one, however, abruptly walked off, went around the corner, and a few seconds later the ASM returned to complete my order. I was extremely confused and asked what had happened, and he said that ""they were not comfortable taking your order.""

I was gobsmacked. Like I literally said at the beginning of this post, I've been a customer for over 30 years, 20,200+ stores, countless interactions with baristas, and I have never had one just walk off abruptly because I was explaining how I wanted my order.

But wait, there's more!

The ASM completed my order, brought me my coffee, and then my water, and then I explained that I'd be heading over to Rehoboth Beach to sit down and work. I explained that hopefully it would not be necessary, but he might be getting a call from that store to confirm that I had made a purchase (I had the sticker on my personal cup, but just in case). Well, as it turns out the DM was in the store, and the ASM went and talked to them, and they called over to Rehoboth Beach to explain that I was okay. Well, kind of.

When I arrived in Rehoboth Beach and asked for the manager or superœâisor, then showed my cup and sticker, they replied ""oh, you're Winter, you're okay."" They then turned to the barista on register to explain that I could get my refill, and now I was confused. Well, apparently, the DM had not understood what I had explained to the ASM and thought that I wanted to redeem a free refill, which is the last thing I want (more coffee). 

I don't know how that confusion occurred, but it continued a pattern which I think accounts for a lot of the negative customer interactions at Starbucks, that partners, even managers, are not listening to the customer and trying to understand what their needs are.

1l37xdh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l37xdh,Where to Propose in Bryce Canyon: Top 5 Unforgettable Locations,"In the last post, we mentioned a heart-touching story of a proposal idea brought through generations in Bryce Canyon‚Äîa tradition deeply rooted in the park's breathtaking landscapes and timeless beauty. Inspired by that tale, we‚Äôve curated a list of the top 5 most romantic spots in Bryce Canyon where you can create your own unforgettable moment.

# 1. Sunset Point

Sunset Point is iconic for its panoramic views of Bryce Canyon‚Äôs vibrant rock formations. The colorful hues during both sunrise and sunset create the perfect romantic ambiance.

**Tip:** Propose at sunset for the most dramatic lighting‚Äîarrive early to secure a spot as it‚Äôs popular!

# 2. Sunrise Point

Ideal for early risers, Sunrise Point offers views of hoodoos illuminated by the soft morning light. This peaceful and quiet area is perfect for intimate proposals.

**Tip:** Bring a blanket for sitting comfortably and perhaps a thermos of coffee to celebrate!

# 3. Wall Street (Navajo Loop Trail)

Wall Street, with its towering rock walls and narrow pathways, creates a unique and secluded atmosphere. It‚Äôs a more adventurous location for couples who love hiking.

**Tip:** Plan your timing carefully‚Äîthis area gets shaded quickly, so midday provides great lighting.

# 4. Inspiration Point

As the name suggests, this spot inspires awe with its bird‚Äôs-eye view of the canyon below. The steep drop-offs and expansive vistas provide a jaw-dropping setting for a proposal.

**Tip:** Hold your moment at the middle or upper levels of the viewpoint for the best scenery.

# 5. Bryce Amphitheater

This striking amphitheater is the park‚Äôs centerpiece. With numerous viewpoints surrounding it, you can choose your favorite for a memorable proposal.

**Tip:** Consider visiting during the quieter off-season for more privacy, and scout locations in advance.",1,1749049552.0,EngagedByNature,0,1.0,False

That's the idea behind Minglespaces: designated areas in everyday places where people can strike up a conversation with someone they don‚Äôt know.

We‚Äôre working on a community building project called Minglespace based in Milwaukee to make it easier for people to meet at the everyday places they already go.  The signs go to fun, low-pressure prompts, from imaginative questions and local community project ideas. If places lead the way in encouraging connection, it can become an expected part of the environment, not something individuals have to initiate on their own.¬†

Imagine how many great ideas, fun conversations, or collaborations we miss out on because there‚Äôs no structure to introduce yourself to someone who might be up for a quick chat. The intention of Minglespaces is to unlock the potential of missed connections.¬†

If you help run a coffee shop, brewery, university, hotel, convention, community center, or other public space people gather, or know one that might like this idea, please let me know. Places can print one of our signs locally using our designs. **Have suggestions for places in Milwaukee that should have one? Add them below and I‚Äôll reach out.**

It‚Äôs completely free to use. You can either use a guest account or sign up for a free account if you want to save your goals across multiple devices. It‚Äôs available on Android and web for now, and I‚Äôll consider an iOS release if there‚Äôs enough interest.

The idea is simple: add a goal, set a weekly target, and check it off daily. That‚Äôs it. Toggle features on and off in your settings - just make it your own.¬†

I‚Äôd love to hear any feedback. I‚Äôm personally not a big fan of notifications and widgets, but if it turns out people really want them, I‚Äôm open to adding them.

Chapter 1  
  
My mom always said a buzzcut is the best hairstyle any girl could have.  
  
""Clean, low-maintenance, and it won't attract boys,"" was her constant refrain.  
  
From childhood through my teens, I walked around with a completely shaved head, enduring strange looks from literally everyone I encountered.  
  
After high school graduation, I finally put my foot down‚Äîthreatening something drastic just to win the right to grow my hair out.  
  
But the night before college move-in day, my mom snuck into my room while I was sound asleep and shaved my head completely bald. Again.  
  
A blood-curdling scream echoed through the bathroom that morning.  
  
I clutched my freshly shaved scalp‚Äînow an ashy gray stubble‚Äîand lost it completely, screaming like a lunatic.  
  
Mom stormed out of the kitchen, spatula in hand, and kicked me hard in the lower back without warning.  
  
""What the hell are you screaming about? It's the crack of dawn‚Äîyou trying to wake up the whole damn neighborhood?""  
  
The kick sent me stumbling forward, my stomach slamming against the edge of the sink.  
  
I barely felt the pain. I whirled around, words spilling out in a frantic mess.  
  
""Why can't I have hair like a normal person? Is having hair suddenly a crime? Do I need to literally die before you're happy?""  
  
Mom just snorted.  
  
""Go ahead and die then. Never seen a kid who threatens their own mother with suicide over something so stupid.""  
  
Her flat, emotionless tone left me feeling like I'd punched a cloud. No impact.  
  
It reminded me of our last standoff. The razor blade had already broken my skin, just centimeters away from my artery. Only then did Mom reluctantly nod, agreeing that my hair would be my choice going forward.  
  
I thought I'd finally won a battle on my eighteenth birthday.  
  
All summer, I watched each new hair sprout with joy. I endured the maddening itch of new growth, daydreaming about college life ahead.  
  
I was so happy, so fulfilled.  
  
I actually believed my parents loved me. Maybe they just hadn't realized how much my hair mattered to me. When confronted with my breakdown, they had finally compromised.  
  
What a joke.  
  
Mom never cared if I lived or died. She just wanted to give me hope first, then crush it with her own hands. All to reinforce her authority‚Äîto remind me I'd never escape her control.  
  
Our argument brought Dad into the bathroom.  
  
He froze when he saw my head, then frowned at Mom. ""Didn't we agree to let her grow it out? Why'd you shave it again?""  
  
""So what if I did? It's for her own good!"" Mom fired back defiantly.  
  
"" You want her suffering in the heat with that messy mop in college? Remember how filthy she gets! Her hair would stink in no time!""  
  
Dad scratched his stubble, playing peacemaker as always.  
  
""Alright, alright, enough drama. Your mom means well,"" he muttered. ""Hurry up and get ready‚Äîwe've got a train to catch. Don't forget you're starting college today!""  
  
""Means well? How exactly is this 'meaning well'?""  
  
Dad's wishy-washy attitude felt like ice water dumped over my head.  
  
I pointed at Mom's perfectly maintained, glossy black hair. ""I'm eighteen‚Äîa legal adult! Don't I deserve to control my own hair? If being bald is so great, why isn't SHE shaving HER head?""  
  
SMACK.  
  
Mom's hand cracked across my face.  
  
""You ungrateful bitch! I've raised you for eighteen years! Fed you! Clothed you! And this is how you speak to me?""  
  
""I've always taught you that successful women get ahead on brains and ability‚Äînot hair! The second you get into that military academy, all you care about is your precious hair? You're not interested in education‚Äîyou just want to seduce men! Looking for some rich boyfriend so you don't have to work!""  
  
Mom was getting more worked up, grabbing my college acceptance letter and threatening to tear it up.  
  
""If that's how it is, we'll cancel everything! No college for you! Stay home where I can watch you! I don't need to worry about you becoming some homewrecker and getting yourself killed!""  
  
I scoffed internally. Not everyone is like you, Mom.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
As it turns out, Dad was originally my mom's best friend's boyfriend.  
  
Mom saw his wealthy family and decided to trap him with a pregnancy. Because of her own sketchy past, she assumes every woman in the world is just as conniving‚Äîincluding her own daughter.  
  
It's been her pattern my whole life. Whenever I show the slightest resistance to her authority, she identifies what matters most to me and uses it as a weapon.  
  
When I was six, I refused to eat scrambled eggs that gave me breathing problems. She destroyed the craft project I'd spent all night making, then called my teacher claiming I was a liar. My favorite teacher believed her and transferred me to another class.  
  
At twelve, I pushed away her hand when she tried to shave my head. She responded by cutting up every sanitary pad in the house. Even when I knelt crying and apologizing, she forced me to go to school in blood-stained pants.  
  
When I was fourteen, I refused to hand-wash her clothes in cold water. She cut off my allowance completely. If I hadn't found a part-time job, I probably would've starved that winter.  
  
And now this.  
  
She knew getting into the college was my greatest dream. To save my chance at college, I had no choice but to surrender again, dropping to my knees.  
  
""Mom, I'm sorry! I was wrong! I was just upset!"" I begged. ""Please don't tear up my acceptance letter! It's my fault! I shouldn't have talked back! I'm really sorry!""  
  
I lost count of how many times I apologized before she finally tossed the letter at my feet, like a queen pardoning a criminal.  
  
""Fine. Go pack your things,"" she said dismissively.  
  
After kneeling so long, my legs were numb.  
  
I struggled to stand, instinctively looking for help, but Dad had already removed himself from the conflict‚Äîsitting on the couch, casually sipping coffee like nothing was happening.  
  
As punishment for my ""disrespect,"" Mom confiscated all the savings from my part-time job.  
  
Worst of all, she removed every hat and scarf from my luggage, ensuring I'd have to walk into college with my patchy, butchered scalp exposed. She wanted me to become the campus laughingstock on day one‚Äîa reputation that would follow me for four years.  
  
The registration area was packed with new students. Everyone who saw my shaved head immediately started whispering.  
  
Some thought I had a serious illness causing hair loss. Others wondered if I had infected sores that might be contagious. A few suggested I was just an attention-seeker.  
  
But without exception, they all kept their distance.  
  
No matter how many years pass, I'll never get used to those looks.  
  
I kept my head down while Mom dragged me through the crowds, handling all my paperwork‚Äîfilling out forms, collecting my student ID, micromanaging every detail. Dad silently carried my heavy luggage behind us.  
  
And there I was, sporting my bizarre bald head, empty-handed while they bustled around. To outsiders, I looked like their precious, spoiled princess.  
  
That's always been their strategy. Acting sacrificial and hardworking in public ensures that whenever conflicts arise, everyone automatically takes their side.  
  
After completing registration, we went to my dorm room. The moment we met my roommates, Mom launched right in:  
  
""Hello girls, this is my daughter, Riley. She'll be your classmate. Her brain doesn't work very well, so I hope you'll look after her.""  
  
My new roommates exchanged uncomfortable glances, looking from my shaved head to my mom, awkwardly nodding to be polite.  
  
Encouraged by their response, Mom cheerfully began making my bed while sharing every embarrassing story from my childhood.  
  
I pressed my lips together, unable to defend myself, just silently repeating: She'll leave soon. Just get through today and she'll be gone. The next four years, if I work hard, I'll never have to go home again. I'll be free.  
  
But as evening approached and all my roommates had left to explore campus, Mom and I were still sitting there, staring at each other.  
  
Finally, I gathered my courage to ask: ""Mom, what time is your train? Isn't Dad waiting for you at the station?""  
  
""What train? I'm not leaving!""  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Mom's voice dripped with smug satisfaction, like she was bragging to her own daughter.  
  
""Didn't I tell you? I got approved for that promotion at work. My interview with corporate headquarters is next week, and your school happens to be close to the interview location. I'll just leave after that. Perfect timing‚ÄîI can stay with you and see how you're adjusting to college life.""  
  
My heart sank. I quietly protested, ""Mom, the school doesn't allow parents to stay in dorms. You should get a hotel room.""  
  
My voice was barely audible‚ÄîI was terrified one wrong word would trigger another violent outburst like at home.  
  
""What do you mean 'not allowed'?"" she snapped.  
  
""Don't worry about it! I'll talk to your school administration myself!""  
  
I don't know what she told the dean, but she returned looking triumphant.  
  
My nightmare wasn't over.  
  
I tried comforting myself: Just hang in there. One more week until freedom!  
  
My phone pinged with a notification‚Äîthe student clubs were hosting a welcome party tonight, encouraging everyone to attend.  
  
For as long as I can remember, I've been insecure about my patchy, shaved head. I habitually made myself invisible in social settings. Throughout school, I rarely joined group activities‚Äîeven at my high school prom, I was just a wallflower in the corner.  
  
Watching my roommates excitedly choosing outfits, I felt a stab of envy, especially seeing their golden curls‚Äîexactly what I'd always dreamed of having.  
  
""What's that? Let me see!"" Before I could react, Mom snatched my phone.  
  
""Welcome party?"" she said loudly.  
  
My roommates turned toward us, drawn by her sharp voice.  
  
My face burned red as I bit my lip, wishing I could disappear under the covers.  
  
""You're going! Always so lazy, never participating in anything,"" she declared.  
  
Then she suddenly turned to my roommates, raising her voice:  
  
""Let's all go to the party together tonight! Oh, it's been years since I was in school‚ÄîI miss that youthful feeling!""  
  
She ran her fingers through her thick, luxurious hair and adjusted her ridiculous fake eyelashes.  
  
My roommates, clearly uncomfortable with this strange, over-the-top woman, mumbled ""Okay, okay"" and quickly grabbed their bags, practically running out the door.  
  
Suddenly it was just Mom and me in the room.  
  
""Mom, are you really going?"" I asked hesitantly.  
  
""Of course! I want to see what kind of people your classmates are. They should get to know you properly."" She started pushing me toward the closet.  
  
""Hurry up and get dressed! God, you're so slow‚Äîit's infuriating.""  
  
After being shoved around, I found myself at the party entrance wearing an outdated purple dress from the last century that didn't even fit anymore.  
  
Night had fallen. Flickering lights spilled from inside, making me squint.  
  
I nervously clutched my dress hem, keeping my head down as a breeze sent chills across my exposed scalp.  
  
""Hey! Look who's here!""  
  
""Holy shit, it's Voldemort!""  
  
Hearing this, I turned to leave.  
  
First day, and already being targeted?  
  
Before I could take a step, a strong hand grabbed me.  
  
""Where do you think you're going? Your classmates are calling you. Are you deaf?!""

‚ÄúThe Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit.‚Äù (Psalm 34:18)

I lift up every soul who suffers on this Earth‚Äîknown or unknown, near or far, seen or unseen. You are not alone. ‚ÄúEven though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for You are with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me.‚Äù (Psalm 23:4)

May you find strength in the quiet moments, courage in the hardest days, and peace that fills your heart beyond understanding. ‚ÄúBut those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.‚Äù (Isaiah 40:31)

Being well is more than the healing of the body‚Äîit is the renewal of your spirit, the comfort of love surrounding you, and the hope that lights your path even when the way is dark. ‚ÄúFor I know the plans I have for you,‚Äù declares the Lord, ‚Äúplans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.‚Äù (Jeremiah 29:11)

To those who care and walk beside the suffering, may you be blessed with patience, wisdom, and gentle strength. ‚ÄúCarry each other‚Äôs burdens, and in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.‚Äù (Galatians 6:2)

And to all who read these words‚Äîmay you be reminded that you are deeply loved, cherished beyond measure, and held in the tender embrace of grace. ‚ÄúNeither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers‚Ä¶ will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.‚Äù (Romans 8:38-39)

I was 21 and was at that stage in life of getting completely drunk all the time with friends (fun times aha) and i was also immature. Which pushed her away, anyway i got over it and all was well. Cut to 2025 i move back to the city and decided to drop her a message, we started chatting and all was well (quick replies from both of us) so i asked her if she wanted to grab a coffee or a drink. She was keen and said yes, so we met up a couple days later. Now i had no intention of it being a date, i just wanted ti see a familiar face. I didnt have feelings for her at all. But then, when i saw her in person, i felt all the emotions come back in literally 0.25 seconds, and i knew i was in trouble, instantly hooked on her again. She said i looked really good, she said something about me had changed (for the 5 years since dating her i had been absolutely crushing the gym and eating very healthy)It most definitely was a date and we had a great time, staying out till late until we said our goodbyes.

We continued to talk after and arranged a second date, but shes at uni plus working a full time job so finding time is hard and she eventually had to cancel. And then things fizzled out.

I reconnected with her about a week ago but she responds every 24 hours or so sometimes longer, but granted she is with her family in italy but still like i know im worth more than this, if she wanted to talk then she would, she likes my stories occasionally and always likes my photos (not that that means anything)

1l37bs8,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups_promotion/comments/1l37bs8/i_built_an_in_app_whatsapp_voice_note_translator/,i built an in app whatsapp voice note translator because the drain pipes backed up into my house,"I live in Costa Rica but came to the US to see my parents and get a hiatal hernia surgery I had been putting off for 2+ years, and wanted to take advantage of the health insurance I still had from my last job (thank you COBRA).

A friend was staying at my house, watching over things and taking care of my dog, when water came flooding out from under the dishwasher when the sink ran for a while, and we had no idea why.

SO

I called one of the guys who helped build my house to go over and check what was going on. Turns out after snaking the pipes, we found coffee grounds, rice, etc, (i do have a garbage disposal), BUT, the snake hit a dead end where it shouldnt have...at the pipe that runs out across the street in the neighborhood.

Turns out after digging the pipe up from the road it was completely smashed, filled with dirt, no wonder the water wasn't draining.

I speak spanish pretty well, (well enough for 90% of things), but when it comes to industries and some slang words I am not familiar with or if I need to 100% understand ,at times I get lost.

We went back and forth about what they were doing and came to a conversation about paying him, I advanced him some money before, and paid him for the day, but just wasn't 100% clear on how we were going to be handling things going from there.

So I looked up how to translate whatsapp audio messages, and every option seemed to be a giant pain with having to download the file and upload the file and translate etc....I found 1 option that worked OK within whatsapp, but I figured I could work on making it better.

I am not a ""coder"" by any means and have minimal experience with coding, just someone who has been living with his parents for almost a month after recovering from surgery waiting to go home and all my friends who are still here are married with kids. Worked on this in my endless amount of free time outside of my regular job.

I used ChatGPT o3 for 100% of the ideation, framework, coding and troubleshooting.

What does it do?

1. After you go through onboarding, simply forward, or send your own voice note in the chat.
2. It transcribes and translates the voice message
3. produces an audio file (you can listen or fwd back to the other person)
4. It works in reverse automatically. SO, if you set up english and spanish, send it and english voice message, get a spanish response, and vice versa.

It also translates text, you just forward or type the message and receive the response.

My teach stack consists of github, supabase, railway, stripe, meta whatsapp business, and twilio.

They independently at around 5.5-6 months adjusted, rolled one way around 7 months adjusted and the other way around 8 months adjusted. Then sort of plateaued. Never crawled. At around 13.5 months adjusted bub started pivoting on his bum. Since then over the last 6 weeks we‚Äôve seen huge progress. They‚Äôve gone from sitting and not really moving to pivoting on their bum, then in the next couple of weeks started full on bum shuffling everywhere and fast, pulling to stand from a chair or from our laps (not the floor), playing in standing, cruising along furniture. In the last 3 weeks they‚Äôve started cruising around corners, between gaps ie from the coffee table to the couch and back, started using a walker and now can go really fast and for ages with it (can use it without stopping for 30 mins or so, just can‚Äôt change direction with it so needs help there), and this week took 1-2 independent steps a couple of times.

They can‚Äôt currently move from lying to sitting independently though - very hesitant to weight-bare through the arms. Possibly close to independent walking though?

CK tests were normal, tested for SMA which also came back normal. Neurologist at 12 months said we can check in at 18 months. Pedeatrician not worried at all. At 12 months neurologist said no need for testing outside of SMA (I wanted that test as previous Pedeatrician scared us about it) as no sign of any neurological issue, and most likely benign hypotonia. Physio is very happy and actually impressed with the progress and recent speed of it, but concerned around the transitions from lying to sitting, which makes me anxious.

Has anyone had similar timelines? If so, how did your little one go? How did you get them to transition from lying to sitting independently? Did they walk first? Any issues?

Hoping to soothe my anxious mind. Thanks.

Cooking dinner while you sit by the table side telling me amazing stories or things you‚Äôve written. Especially moments where you just blast the speakers forgetting we have neighbors. How you just go around the room singing while I cook watching you performing just for me. Then Id blend in to whatever key you sang with. 

While Im busy cooking I miss how you squeeze in between just to get cuddled up. Just to ask for kisses even if you dont. I know you dont ask at all. But whenever I do ask, I see how excited you get just to give me a kiss. How you slowly close your eyes and bow a little. I know you want me to kiss your forehead. I dont see the smile. But I feel it all the time. 

As excited as you are an energetic at dawn. I have to always remind you its time for bed. You snuggle up right away since you fit perfectly between my arm and body. You told me you‚Äôre not used to it at first. But you ended up snuggling like a little baby. 

Then I‚Äôd stand up making sure your jug is filled that way you dont need to stand up and find your way in the dark to drink. Made sure the bathroom door is closed in case monsters show up. Made sure the blinds are closed so city lights dont shine as we sleep. How you wake me up on early dawn just to let me know you‚Äôre hungry. 

The sad tone I hear whenever we go to the store after buying ramen that theres no icecream. Since I always drink coffee anytime. As cute as it seems to me you also want to drink coffee. But not like mine, strong and bold. So I made sure to adjust it right that would tickle your tastebuds. Sweet enough for you to smile and make a satisfied sound (tsptsptsp) hearing that rings in my head that I know how exactly I should make your coffee first always. Then I make mine. 

I miss those nights where I wait by the side walk. Watching every cab hoping its you. My face just lights up and smile whenever I see you coming out of the cab. Carry your bag and loved listening to you talk the whole night about your day. I dont normally talk about mine cos I dont see anything interesting. The only thing excites me at work is knowing Id come home to see you and listen to you. 

I miss you walking me to the lift as I leave for work. Hearing you upset that I have to go. Then you‚Äôd ask for more hugs and kisses. Even though I‚Äôm more than late. Didnt really care much. Just to steal few mins with you.

But above all, it ran *best* when Kevin wasn‚Äôt around.

Kevin wasn‚Äôt a bad guy‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt yell or steal lunches or commit felonies (that they knew of). But somehow, whenever Kevin entered the room, it was like someone had dropped a wet sponge on a live microphone: everything got weird and painfully quiet.

He‚Äôd slide into morning meetings five minutes late with a loud *‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up, weirdos?‚Äù*, followed by an offbeat comment like *‚ÄúI had a dream last night that I gave birth to a microwave. What do you think that means, Carol?‚Äù* Carol, who managed HR and had a strict no-eye-contact policy with Kevin, would pretend to type something urgently.

During lunch, Kevin loved to sit down next to people mid-conversation and say things like *‚ÄúYou ever wonder if your dentist gets aroused by plaque?‚Äù* or *‚ÄúI only wear socks made from alpaca hair. Changed my life.‚Äù* People would immediately discover pressing matters back at their desks.

One time, he brought a homemade meatloaf shaped like a baby to the potluck. No one touched it. Kevin was confused. ‚ÄúWhat? It‚Äôs got olives for eyes!‚Äù

And yet, when Kevin took a week off to attend an ‚ÄúExperimental Laughter Retreat in the Ozarks,‚Äù the office changed. People lingered in the break room. Carol laughed out loud. Raj from IT organized a spontaneous Mario Kart tournament. Even Greg‚Äîwho once described his emotional range as ‚Äúdry toast‚Äù‚Äîsmiled.

They all felt it: the gentle peace of a Kevin-free office.

By the time he returned, someone had started a whiteboard list titled **‚ÄúThings We Got Done While Kevin Was Away‚Äù**. At the top:

1. Finished the Jefferson account
2. Reorganized the server
3. Relearned how to exhale without bracing for weirdness

Kevin walked in, said *‚ÄúI missed you turkeys. Anyone want to hear about my ayahuasca meltdown?‚Äù*, and the room tensed like a cat hearing a vacuum cleaner.

Everyone suddenly remembered something very important to do elsewhere. Kevin smiled, unaware.

In a way, Kevin *was* important to the office‚Äîhe was the walking reminder of just how good things could be when he wasn‚Äôt there.",1,1749047741.0,theericzaneshow,1,1.0,False

I recently read (on this very site, ironically) that cleaning up your nether regions can be both hygienic *and* appreciated by partners. My girlfriend (29F), for the record, has never expressed an opinion either way, but I thought: ‚ÄúWhy not surprise her with a tidy taint?‚Äù This was my first mistake.

I should also note: I am a perfectionist. I alphabetize my spices. I clean my lint trap after every dryer cycle. I once spent three hours comparing five brands of white paint before choosing one for our bathroom. When I commit to something, I *commit*.

So, I decide to go all in. I watched four YouTube tutorials, read several blog posts, and even consulted a subreddit dedicated to male grooming. I purchased a new safety razor, exfoliating scrub, tea tree oil toner, and one of those small vanity mirrors with a gooseneck arm, so I could, in theory, see what I was doing.

Here‚Äôs where things start going downhill.

I set everything up in the bathroom but quickly realized the lighting was subpar and the mirror angle was impossible. So I moved my operation to the living room where we have huge bay windows and natural light. I laid out a towel (okay, it was *her* favorite yoga mat, but I did put a microfiber cloth on top of it) and got to work.

Positioning was... awkward. I tried squatting over the mirror, but my thighs started shaking. I moved into a kind of reverse crab walk. I won‚Äôt get into specifics, but imagine a hairless, terrified Gollum with a razor. That was me.

Everything was going surprisingly well until‚Äîwhile using my non-dominant hand to apply the razor to the perineal zone‚ÄîI *sneezed*. Violently. Razor slipped. I nicked something very vascular. It bled *a lot*. I panicked, flailed, and in doing so knocked over the bottle of toner, which rolled and dumped its contents onto the yoga mat.

In my effort to stand up and assess the damage, I forgot that I had applied shaving cream liberally. My foot slipped, I fell directly onto the mirror (which cracked), and I somehow elbowed the coffee table hard enough to spill a glass of red wine (left over from a podcast-recording session the night before) *also* onto the yoga mat.

So now I‚Äôm sitting on a broken mirror, bleeding from my taint, crying from both physical pain and sheer humiliation, in a puddle of tea tree toner and Cabernet Sauvignon, surrounded by tufts of pubic hair like some kind of grotesque fairy ring.

My girlfriend walked in shortly thereafter because I had *forgotten we had dinner reservations* and she came back to change. She took one look at the scene, made a noise I can only describe as ‚Äúviscerally distressed,‚Äù and left.

She‚Äôs now at her sister‚Äôs. She texted me to say she needs time to ‚Äúprocess things.‚Äù

So, AITA for trying to surprise my girlfriend with an immaculately groomed perineum and instead causing a biohazard that may have ended our relationship?

so, I grew up drinking just one cup of coffee in the morning but in recent years I started having a large can of energy drink or a second cup of coffee at least. 

Last year I went a little over 2 weeks without coffee /energy drinks and although I felt tired, I had the best sleep of my life. I did use matcha tea in the morning I must say. But still it was a drastic effect (both positive and negative). 

Now, I have started also other bad habits due to the bad sleep as in the last month I started waking up multiple times during sleep. Never could relate to this problem before. 

I feel like I can't find a way to quit coffee without crashing at my job. I searched for caffeine pills that I can use to cut down but I didn't find one with less caffeine. 

I could try to make small bottles with less and less caffeine but how do I go about it if I don't have a scale?

This isn't anything other than sharing an experience. Not looking sympathy or to throw shade at my ex but just say what's on my mind. There's always 3 sides to a story, what I think happened, what she think happened and what actually happened somewhere in the middle.

Me and my ex ended this weekend gone after 5 years together. We met when were both 25 during covid and eventually ended up together, moving in together for 4 years and getting many cats in-between. She was a very sweet and kind soul and there are so many great memories I'll always cherish.

The last year (2024) wasn't so great. We were both avoidant and refused to talk to each and just communicate how we felt which manifested exactly how you'd imagine. We both said horrible shit to each other and eventually grew to resent each other. We'd go through cycles of just not being nice to each other, ignoring the needs of the other. We'd sit down eventually when it got that bad, discuss what was wrong and agree to try again and change. There was one period where we went 3 months without really doing much together or speaking much in the same house. It takes two to tango but that was mostly my fault because I couldn't bring myself to face the hard conversation with her that I wasn't happy and that maybe we should end. It was horrible for her and I really regret how I handled that. She didn't deserve to feel like an alien in our home and I wish I'd just got out of my own head to sit down and communicate how I felt. We sat down eventually after that, we explained to each other how we made each other feel, agreed to make change and went again.

Fast forward to April this year and same thing starts happening. This time we just broke up. No explanation to each other as to why, we just simply agreed to split. She moved her stuff out over a 2 week period and eventually at the second to last batch of stuff, we sat down and actually talked now we'd been apart. It slowly became apparent that although we were saying the same stuff, nothing we were talking about was unfixable. A lot of it was really small stuff in reality. We just needed to learn to communicate, not avoid and start working towards small changes to better things. She left and the next day I asked to meet. We sat down for a coffee and we spent a couple hours talking about trying one last time, but this time we'd do it differently. I took the time out to think about her needs, my needs and how we could avoid making the same mistakes that led us here. We planned out the future we wanted, moving back in, kids etc. She took the weekend to think about it and we agreed to get back together.

It was great and felt like things were how they were when we first met. We'd make time each week to sit down and talk about our feelings and it felt like much healthier experience. I learned a lot from the what went wrong the first time and I really tried to open up and talk about what's on my mind no matter how hard it felt or uncomfortable it was. 

2 weeks in I noticed she was still messaging someone. I felt a bit shit about it so I decided to bring it up rather than bottling it up. When I did she got very uncomfortable, and played it down. Eventually I asked to see the messages exchanged which made her somewhat uncomfortable and she told me I was ""controlling"". Looking back, maybe that was a boundary I shouldn't have crossed but in my mind I was just thinking that there was no point wasting time getting back together if she's entertaining someone else. She got defensive, hid behind her phone, and eventually showed me. It honestly felt like she'd deleted the most recent messages and just left the ones behind that made her story make sense but I'll never know. She removed him and I chose to accept and trust what she told me.

The weeks after that were great until the final week before the breakup. She had booked a solo holiday when we were split. When we got back together, she told me about it. I communicated that I felt uneasy about the idea of her going away alone but I wasn't going to stop here and that maybe it would good to help get out of her comfort zone and maybe help with her anxiety in some way etc. Fast forward towards the holiday, for the week before it she started to get a bit distant, didn't seem like she wanted to spend time together and generally was just off. 

She went on the holiday, we spoke everyday and it all seemed okay till the last day. We facetimed, and after 5 mins we ended the call because she wanted an early night. She got back on the Friday, came to stay at the house but the minute she arrived it was clear that something really was off. She kept telling me she was tired from travelling and wanted to nap/sleep. I went out to get us food and let her nap, we ate dinner together and then she decided to go to sleep on the sofa next to me. Before she did, I asked if she maybe wanted to stay the next night also so we could do something together, to which she rolled her eyes and said ""I'm already staying tonight"" and rolled over to sleep. Bit harsh I thought but I left it and let her get to sleep. I put some music on and decided to doom scroll as you do. About 30 mins later she all of sudden jumps up and says ""I don't feel comfortable, I'm going back home"". Got up, got her stuff and got ready to leave. It was so weird and she's never acted like this before. I kept asking her what was wrong and eventually got a load of confusing reasons:  

* I don't feel comfortable
* I'm tried and just want to go home
* you seem annoyed with me that I'm tired
* you were playing music loud because I was sleeping to wake me up
* you never play music on the TV, I just found it weird

Eventually she turned around and told me that she didn't want to do it anymore and that we both know it's not working. From my perspective I felt she was being off the last week or so but not that it wasn't working... I kept probing to understand what was really wrong but I just got some pretty harshly delivered comments:

* I feel anxious coming here
* I wish we had just stayed broken up the first time
* I didn't even try this time
* I thought I'd be happy to see you but I'm not

It was all so confusing the way it was done. Maybe it's all true but it felt like she wasn't being honest about what was truly going on in her mind and she was just trying to find any reason to justify why she wanted to end so abruptly after coming back from her holiday.

  
My gut feeling? I think she messed around with someone on her holiday. It seemed to out of character and it almost seemed like how a guilty person would behave. It was over. We agreed for her to her stuff and that she'd take some of the cats and that would be that.

  
She came the next day, got her stuff and eventually sat down to get the cats. I broke down in tears. It's the first time I've ever cried in front of her but I guess the emotion of losing the cats and what happened the night before really got to me. From my perspective, I really tried this time. I admitted all my flaws and worked really hard to work on them. I spent the time to understand her needs finally and worked to provide them as best as I could. To hear things like ""I didn't even try this time"" when I really did or ""I thought I'd be happy to see you but I'm not"" after I spent all week being excited to see her was pretty crushing. I got it all out. She broke down crying at the sight of me crying and started apologising for how it went:

* I'm sorry I said all that last night
* I didn't mean for it to end like this
* I don't want you to think I've cheated because I'm not that sort of person
* I'm going to regret this one day but you deserve better
* It's not you it's me
* I need to go do work on myself and heal

In the end, despite the pain, we kept it civil, we wished each other happiness and luck for the future and went separate ways. We haven't spoken since the weekend and likely never will again.  


I don't think I got the true answer and likely never will. Maybe she cheated or found someone new. Maybe she was just not happy with me anymore. Maybe we weren't compatible. Maybe my past actions & words had caused lasting damage. Maybe I said or done something recently that she didn't like. There's a million situations in my head but I'll never know what it really was. Pretty crushing after finally working on opening up fully working on my flaws and communicating as best as I could but that's life I guess.   


The biggest lesson I learnt here is that communication is the most important thing in the world. I'll never avoid talking about how I feel ever again with a significant other and hopefully I meet someone who's also just as open. I can't undo the things I've done or said but I know that I've learnt some valuable lessons even if the ending was pretty brutal and painful and I'll remember the good times even if the end wasn't. I don't think she meant to hurt me like that but clearly she preferred to avoid telling me whatever it was and it resulted it that outcome.

I'll always love her. She was my first one. The kindest and most caring soul I'd met. I hope she get's what she wants in life. I'm going to miss her. I'm going to miss those two cats.

All I can do now is keep drawing lessons and hope for better days. Life is some journey right?

TLDR do not buy pre loved Korean bags from Relux on FB or WhatsApp. There also may be Reddit accounts associated as well. I of course have every screenshot but for the sake of this post I will just share a few.   
‚û°Ô∏èOn 5/1 I messaged a Reddit user about a bag for sale on this sub. This user and I had a friendly conversation and they recommended I contact Jamie/ReLux for pre loved Korean bags. I contacted the seller purchased a bag on 5/13, paid, and received a tracking number from the seller.  
‚û°Ô∏èThe tracking number still has not been scanned in today, which is 3 weeks later. I followed up with the seller on 5/21, 5/27, 6/2. Through this time she did not provide a receipt showing the item was dropped off at UPS. I understand that shipping mistakes happen but without a receipt or the package being scanned in or support from the seller I have to assume it was never dropped off.  
‚û°Ô∏èOn 5/27 the seller posted on her Facebook group stating that someone working with her ‚Äúmismanaged and stole customer funds creating delays‚Ä¶. It was intentional theft‚Äù. I do not know if this applied to my situation but it certainly didn‚Äôt make me feel better about it.  
‚û°Ô∏èOn 6/2 I reached out to the seller to try and find a resolution. I received rude responses from the seller that led me to post here asking ‚Äúwhat would you do in this situation‚Äù including selected redacted portions of our conversation. Here is the link to my original post (https://www.reddit.com/r/RepladiesDesigner/s/GxLXS9wjgX). At this point the seller then proceeded to post our entire unedited conversation to her Facebook group of 700+ people, including my name and tracking number which leads to my address, effectively doxxing me to the internet.  
‚û°Ô∏èWhen I asked her to take down the post including my personal information, she told me that my post falls under slander & extortion (incorrect). Up until that point I refrained from including specific information about the seller or fb and was asking about advice in general. What‚Äôs interesting to me is multiple people then messaged me and asking if it was her, immediately knew who the seller was from the rude interactions & shady antics

Are you all finding it harder and harder to sit through the daily ads for rewards?


First off, I bought the one-time remove ads years ago, so all ads I watch are voluntary for rewards. 
For the past year or two, as part of my morning routine while I made coffee/lunch/got ready for work/etc. I would diligently go through the rewards ads, coin ads in the store, and the daily puzzle bonus ad every single morning.

However, lately I've found the ads are becoming more and more cumbersome. It seems half the ads are launching the app store automatically, so you have to be actively paying attention to every ad so you can exit out of the store and continue the ad. Also there's the annoying 3-part ads, ads that at are 1 1/2 to 2 minutes long, and then I've started encountering ads that you watch through, click the X, and then watch the ad all over again....only to be awarded with 1 Bee? (Or worse....hearts I have no use for)

Anyways, I know I'm just venting and this is definitely a first-world problem. But I think PeopleFun's lack of quality control on ads is going catch up with them. I've found myself more and more just simply not doing the rewards ads. I grab the freebies from the store & gift box, only electing to sit through the Daily Puzzle ad for the extra butterflies. I've become a 1 ad a day customer.

Those of you that didn't have the option for the One-time Ad-free purchase, I greatly sympathize with you. I cannot fathom trying to seriously get into the game, play competitively, or even casually enjoy the game for any length of time while having to endure the current quality-state of the ad experience.

I'll be coming to Belfast for a few weeks this month for a summer school at QUB. What are your recommendations for queer and artsy things? 

I'm not much of a clubbing person but I like a bar with a more laid back atmosphere. I do enjoy drag and burlesque. I also love arts markets, bookstores, historic sites, coffee shops, and crafting.

And if any queer people in Belfast would like to chat let me know.",1,1749046735.0,northernireland,5,0.53,False

1l36qnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1l36qnt/i_almost_burned_my_house_down_because_of_water/,I almost burned my house down because of water and a cup  coffee,"A couple weeks ago, my mom and I were hanging out. We were watching some cult shit and just laughing. 

I got hungry, so I went to the kitchen. My mom was following me because she wanted to heat up her coffee. She tells me to let her heat up coffee first before I put my ramen into the microwave. So, while her coffee was heating, I put my ramen into the bowl and got it ready for the microwave.

Fast forward, I'm outside with my mom and the dog, and I think ""my ramen is probably ready"". I go into the kitchen and see smoke coming out of the microwave. I immediately stop the microwave and slowly open it. Smoke fills the house and burnt plastic smell fills the house. I look into the ramen bowl

I forgot the fucking water.

The ramen was burnt and fused with the plastic bowl. I walk outside, terrified to tell my mom. My mom looks at me and I say,

""I may have possibly forgot the water in the ramen.""

My mom puts her cigarette on the ashtray and goes inside the house. She locks the dog in the backyard and opens the front and garage door, to get the plastic smell out of the house. She took the bowl out of the microwave and started to film for some reason.

""The ramen looked like if Justin Timberlake tried to dye his hair black"" she said.

She brings the ramen to a puddle in the backyard and puts it in. When it hits the water it immediately starts to steam and the dog keeps trying to eat it. 

We went fully outside, into the rain, because the plastic smell made us feel like we were high. 

Not long after that, my grandmother pulls up in the driveway. She has a big smile on her face when she sees me and she rolls the windows down. My mom starts telling her what happened and I just have smile on my face like ""oopsies"" 

One of them asks me how I forgot the water. My guess is so first, my brain works different. So I was thinking about the microwave so much, I completely forgot the water.

Later that night, I'm staying at my great aunt and great grandmother's house. I asleep and I have a dream of the exact same thing that I did, except it was my great grandmother and a piece of toast.

And just a few days ago, I ALMOST DID THE EXACT SAME DAMN THING!!!

I'm about to put the ramen in the microwave and I look in he bowl to realize I forgot the water. I added the water, then put it in. 

When I went outside, my mom say, ""did you remember the water""

""Yep"" I said, the muttered ""almost didnt"" but she didn't hear the last part.

It's been over a month and our microwave still reaks of burnt plastic.

Lesson learned, remember water, so my ramen doesn't look like Justin Timberlake tried to dye his hair black.

Ever wished turning cash into Bitcoin could be as easy as grabbing a coffee from a vending machine? Welcome to the futuristic charm of **Bitcoin ATMs**‚Äîthose sleek, glowing boxes popping up in convenience stores, gas stations, and malls, just waiting to teleport your paper bills into digital gold.

Bitcoin ATMs (or BTMs, if you're feeling fancy) are part of the ever-growing, ever-glowing crypto landscape. Unlike traditional bank ATMs, these beauties don‚Äôt spit out $20s‚Äîthey suck them in and send shiny satoshis to your Bitcoin wallet. Some even let you go the other way‚Äîsell your BTC and walk away with hard cash. It‚Äôs like having a personal money wizard in a metal box.

Now, let‚Äôs talk logistics. You stroll up to one of these machines. You‚Äôre excited. The crypto vibes are real. But then‚Äî*cue dramatic music*‚Äîthe ATM asks for your Bitcoin address. If you‚Äôre new to the game, this can feel like being asked to recite Elvish from *Lord of the Rings*. But don‚Äôt sweat it. That‚Äôs where your new best friend comes in: [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com).

This little gem of a web app is your crypto wingman. It lets you generate sleek, scannable Bitcoin QR codes in seconds. Just pop in your Bitcoin address (no need to remember it‚Äîit‚Äôs not your mom‚Äôs phone number), and BAM! You‚Äôve got a clean, professional-looking QR code ready for action.

Why is this awesome? Because Bitcoin ATMs love QR codes. Instead of trying to manually type your long and cryptic address into a touch screen (and praying you don‚Äôt miss a character), you just hold up your code, let the ATM do the scanning, and boom‚Äîyour Bitcoin is on its way. It‚Äôs not just easier‚Äîit‚Äôs cooler. You feel like a crypto spy on a mission.

But it‚Äôs not just for ATMs. With [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](http://BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com), you can create QR codes for *anything* Bitcoin-related. Want to sell digital art for BTC? Slap a QR on your website. Accepting Bitcoin at your food truck? Print a QR and stick it to your cash box. Hosting a raffle on the blockchain? Yep, QR codes got your back there too.

It‚Äôs simple. It‚Äôs sleek. It‚Äôs Bitcoin made friendly.

So the next time you see a Bitcoin ATM glowing in the corner of a store like it‚Äôs about to beam someone to Mars, don‚Äôt hesitate. Walk up, scan your QR code from [**BitcoinQRCodeMaker.com**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), feed it some bills, and watch the magic happen.

Because in a world where the future of money is digital, QR codes are your passport‚Äîand Bitcoin ATMs are the gateway.

Go scan, go Bitcoin, and go make those codes. üöÄ",1,1749046710.0,BitcoinQR,0,1.0,False

Heya! I've been making this game for the last year. It has evolved from a simple morning coffee simulator into a game about life, home, time, creativity, and distractions. It's an interactive narrative sandbox. A very rough comparison could be: Unpacking meets The Beginners Guide, but I hope it eventually stands on its own.

Anywho! It's my game, I'm proud of it, and I would love if some of you would give the demo a try and either tell me what you think here, or through the form/discord. This will be my first Next Fest, and so here we go :D
