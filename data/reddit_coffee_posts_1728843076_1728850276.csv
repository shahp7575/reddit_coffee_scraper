1g2yl4c,https://i.redd.it/hm5cbsa5zkud1.jpeg,"From the Summer of 1993, my First Trip to Las Vegas ","I stayed in the cheapest room I could find, which turned out to be at the Imperial Palace. 

We didn’t rent a car so we walked to all the Strip casinos. In freaking July! That was the last time I ever did that. 

As we walked by The Sands there was a barker outside hyping their Free Slot Tournament. It was an all day event with winners every hour. The fifty highest scores were invited to play in the Final Round at the end of the day. 

It was my first slot tournament of any kind. The sessions were really short, probably two minutes at the longest. It was clearly well designed. Who can resist a chance to score some cash for free? Ever so easily they pull you in off the street and get you inside the casino.

And believe it or not, I had the highest score of my session. It was also the highest score posted so far that hour. It was 10:25 am. They told me if my score held up for the rest of the hour I would win $50. And at the end of the day, if my score was one of the 50 highest, I would get to play in the Final for a bigger cash prize. 

So we walked down the Strip to the Casino Royale. I wanted to check out their Mini Crap table. Half the size of a real crap table, and run by a single dealer/stickman, it was such a weird game. Back in the day, serious craps players sneered at Mini Craps. That didn’t confront me, I’m not a purist. 

I guess I played just enough to get noticed by a floor supervisor. As I cashed out he dropped a coupon for a free Strawberry Shortcake on the table for us. It was for the snack bar upstairs. I thanked him kindly and we went upstairs and enjoyed the treat. 

That Strawberry Shortcake was my first Comp. I think the cash value was either 99 cents or maybe $1.50. 

We walked back to The Sands to check to see if my score had held up through the rest of the hour. It did! I won $50!  And I had a shot at making it to the Final Round. 

I was so freaking stoked! It was exactly at that moment when I fell hopelessly in love with Las Vegas. 

Sadly my score didn’t hold up and I didn’t make the Final Round. But nevermind the bollocks, I won $50!!!

Plus I got this cool Sands Coffee Mug. Everyone that played in the Free Slot Tournament got one. ",1,1728850162.0,LasVegas,0,1.0,False

I feel like coffee is something I will have to give up or just completely switch to decaf which I do drink often but I’m not convinced it’s a good alternative. I will also drink chai often and it’s my favorite.

1g2yk47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1g2yk47/reclaiming_strength_from_loss_to_renewal_through/,Reclaiming Strength: From Loss to Renewal Through Semen Retention,"At 26, I hit what felt like rock bottom.

It started slowly. I’d wake up and see a few more hairs on my pillow than usual. At first, I brushed it off. Everyone sheds, right? But over time, I noticed more. Every time I looked in the mirror, it felt like my hairline was retreating, inch by inch. My hair, which I’d never given much thought to before, suddenly became the center of my world. It sounds stupid, I know, but it started to mess with my head.

Each time I stepped into the shower, I’d watch helplessly as more strands circled the drain. It was like watching something slip away, something that I couldn’t stop. I became obsessed—checking my reflection every chance I got, avoiding bright lights, even comparing myself to every guy I saw. I started withdrawing from social situations, making excuses not to hang out with friends, feeling like I couldn’t face the world. People told me I was overthinking it, but they didn’t understand the shame that was building up inside me.

And then, in the midst of all this, there was my other struggle—something I never told anyone. For years, I’d been stuck in this cycle of daily ejaculation. I told myself it was normal. Every guy does it, right? But it wasn’t just that. It had become this escape for me—a way to numb out, to not think about all the shit I was dealing with, including the hair loss. It was like I needed that release just to get through the day, and the more I leaned on it, the more drained I felt. Physically, mentally, emotionally—I was exhausted.

I’d wake up every morning feeling like I hadn’t slept at all, dragging myself through the day, trying to focus on work or life, but always feeling this underlying emptiness. It was like I had no energy for anything real. And honestly, I hated myself for it. I hated that I couldn’t stop, that I had no control over my own impulses. I started to wonder if the way I was living had more to do with my hair loss than I thought. Was I, somehow, making myself weaker, more vulnerable?

I hit a point where I couldn’t take it anymore. I was ashamed of who I had become. It felt like everything was slipping away—my confidence, my energy, my sense of self. I needed something to change, anything.

That’s when I stumbled on semen retention. I was up late, scrolling through Reddit like I always did, when I found a post from a guy who talked about how it had transformed his life. He wasn’t some self-help guru; he was just a regular guy who, like me, felt lost and desperate. Something about his words hit me hard. I’d never considered that holding back, something as simple as not giving in to that daily release, could change anything. But I was at a point where I had nothing left to lose.

I decided to try it.

The first few days were hell. I was so used to that quick escape that I didn’t know how to cope without it. I was irritable, restless, and constantly tempted to just give in and go back to what I knew. But I kept thinking about the guy in the post, and the way he talked about how it had changed him. So I pushed through.

After about a week, I started to feel something shift. It wasn’t huge, but it was there—this tiny flicker of energy that I hadn’t felt in years. I woke up one morning and didn’t feel like I was drowning in exhaustion. My mind felt clearer, sharper even. I didn’t need the usual cup of coffee just to function.

Weeks passed, and things continued to change. My self-control grew stronger, and with it, my confidence. I wasn’t just some guy hiding behind a hat or avoiding mirrors anymore. I started taking better care of myself, focusing on things that mattered. It wasn’t like I had magically reversed my hair loss, but I no longer felt like it was the end of the world. For the first time in what felt like forever, I could look in the mirror and not feel disgusted by what I saw.

Semen retention gave me more than just energy or confidence. It gave me my life back. It showed me that I had the power to change, to be more than my insecurities and addictions. I was no longer that guy living day to day, constantly drained and ashamed of who I was.

I still don’t have all the answers. Some days are harder than others. But I’ve learned to trust myself again. I’ve learned that I can hold onto my energy and direct it toward something better. Something real.

If you're struggling with hair loss or feeling like you're stuck in a cycle of emptiness like I was, I just want you to know—it’s not too late to take control. It’s not too late to find the strength within yourself. You don’t need to keep giving away your energy for nothing. Keep holding on. It’s worth it.

If medical malpractice were a sport, she’d have a trophy case lined with gold medals. How this woman hasn’t been dragged out of that hospital in handcuffs is beyond me. This lady has been nothing but a disaster since day one. She walks around with this holier-than-thou attitude, like she’s the second coming of Dr. House, but she’s got the medical competence of a YouTube conspiracy theorist. Her real specialty isn’t medicine, it’s covering her ass. She couldn’t diagnose a headache if someone hit her upside the head with an MRI machine, but she’s got all the time in the world to meddle in people’s lives and careers. The real disease in that hospital is Portia, and if she doesn’t get exposed for the lying, manipulative disaster that she is, it’s a fucking crime.

Portia is the absolute worst thing to happen to General Hospital since the OLTL crossover. This woman walks into a room, and it’s like the air thickens with the stench of arrogance and incompetence. Every single time she opens her mouth, I feel like the entire IQ of the room drops 20%. She couldn’t diagnose a cold if the patient walked in sneezing and holding a thermometer Mary sue mother Teresa mama Celeste in a fucking lab coat. 

This whole mess with Heather’s test results is just the latest in a long line of shady decisions. You can’t even call it malpractice at this point—it’s a full-blown career in sabotaging people’s health. Portia is the queen of gaslighting and self-righteousness. How is she still walking around the hospital, pretending she’s competent? I wouldn’t trust her to make me a cup of coffee, let alone hand this slime my medical chart.

I’m crossing my fingers that Brad exposes her faster than she can say “I swear, I’m a good person.” If she spent half as much time actually doing her job instead of meddling in everyone’s business, she might actually be competent at… I don’t know, being a doctor? When that bomb drops, I’ll be front and center with popcorn, watching Portia’s little “I’m doing this for my family” narrative crumble like a stale cracker.

She’s got more skeletons in her closet than the Q mansion, and it’s time someone threw that door wide open. Here’s hoping Brad blows it all up—because if anyone needs to go down in flames, it’s Portia. Time for Brad to get his get back!",1,1728850047.0,GeneralHospital,0,1.0,False

I was talking to my boyfriend and mentioned that a friend of mine wanted to go out for a drink or coffee. I was pretty excited about it. Here’s the problem. I don’t drink. I don’t like alcohol. I don’t really like coffee but I assumed that wouldn’t be a problem. My boyfriend knows I don’t like alcohol but what he said about it really hurt me. He basically said that I shouldn’t be going out for drinks because I don’t drink and when I said it wouldn’t be a problem he said that I should drink because when I go out and I don’t drink it makes everyone else around me, who is drinking uncomfortable.
My boyfriend doesn’t class himself as a big drinker and the only time we’ve been around people drinking is at my mums parties. I have tried drinking before I don’t like any alcohol. I didn’t think it was a problem for my boyfriend but apparently it is. 
This is the first time he bought it up and it really caught me off guard. 
I actually confronted him about it this weekend along with other comments he made the same night. He double down at saying that I make people uncomfortable when I don’t drink.
I mentioned I could try to drink, but he said he wasn’t trying to change me and I shouldn’t do anything just to make him happy. But I feel like if he doesn’t want me to change then why bring it up.
I feel like there’s something wrong with me. How do I approach in the future when I talked to him today he just shut me down saying he didn’t wanna talk about it right now and why was I bringing it up?

My wife wanted me to get her parents approval before we get married, so when we decided to travel to France (where her parents live) we met up in a nice café to get to know each other. 

Some context:
It is important to know that I had recently finished my military mandatory enlistment in the Swiss army (shout out for getting me married) and started working long hours again, which meant that my bowl movement was still set to army time: one shit every couple of days. 
You also need to know, my mother in law is an extremely anxious and fearful woman. She worries a lot about a lot of things, especially her daughter. 

So when I met her parents, I got myself a coffee, and not 5 minutes in, I started feeling dizzy. Whenever I tried to talk or breathe, I would get light heated and felt like I'm going to pass out. 
Now, I didn't know what was wrong, and my now mother in law was starting to get very worried for me. After about 5 minutes, I excused myself and went to the toilet. Let me tell you, I had never had such a huge shit in my life. I went from feeling like dying to waking up in heaven. I felt like I could run a marathon right then and there. 

When I got back to the table, I had an extremely well get to know each other with my wife's parents and they loved me. 
Fast forward to about half a year ago, my wife tells me that her mother approved of me because she thought I was so shy, anxious and worried about meeting her parents that she saw herself in me. That I am a reserved, young, shy man that would certainly take care of her daughter because of how in touch with my emotions I am.

I would probably choose the W60th apartment if the two apartments were equal. W60 feels safer walking home at night since there’s just people around at all hours and also feels more central.

Am I missing something about either of these neighborhoods and is there an obvious neighborhood/apartment you would choose here?

# Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

I recently came across Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. As someone who has struggled with losing weight for years despite diet and exercise, I was intrigued but also skeptical. Could just adding something to my daily coffee really help me lose weight?

# [→→→→→→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

I decided there was only one way to find out — try it myself. In this detailed review, I’ll share my experience using Java Burn, including the pros, cons, ingredients, and most importantly — did it actually help me lose weight?

# What Exactly is Java Burn?

**Java Burn is a patent-pending weight loss supplement sold exclusively online through JavaBurn.com.** It comes in powdered packets that you simply mix into your morning coffee.

The powder contains a blend of plant-based ingredients like green tea extract, L-theanine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid. According to the creators, these compounds work synergistically to:

* Boost metabolism
* Increase fat burning
* Suppress appetite
* Regulate blood sugar levels

The overall goal is to help users lose weight by enhancing their body’s natural metabolic function.

>

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

Photo by LyfeFuel on Unsplash

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.

I tried Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement designed to be mixed with coffee, with the hope of boosting my metabolism and shedding a few pounds. The idea of simply adding a tasteless, odourless powder to my morning coffee seemed convenient and worth exploring. Here, I share my experience with Java Burn, covering its effectiveness, ingredients, and overall value.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Effectiveness and Weight Loss Results

*After using Java Burn for several weeks, I noticed some positive effects on my weight loss journey. I found that the combination of the supplement and my usual coffee helped me feel more energised throughout the day. It seemed to support my metabolism, as I gradually saw changes on the scale. While it wasn’t a miraculous transformation, the results were steady. The weight loss process felt more manageable, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. Java Burn did not lead to any significant jitters or crashes, which are often associated with other weight loss products containing caffeine.*

Ingredients and Their Impact

Java Burn’s formula includes natural ingredients such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid from coffee beans. Each of these components is known for their metabolism-boosting properties. The green tea extract, for instance, is a well-known antioxidant that can help with fat oxidation, while L-carnitine supports the body’s ability to turn fat into energy. Chromium is included to help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings. I appreciated the transparency about the ingredients, as well as the fact that it is free from artificial additives. These natural elements made me more confident about its safety and effectiveness.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the standout features of Java Burn is its convenience. The individual sachets made it easy to incorporate into my routine, whether at home or on the go. Since the powder is tasteless, it did not alter the flavour of my coffee, which I appreciated as a coffee enthusiast. Mixing it into my morning cup of coffee became a seamless habit. This simplicity was one of the main reasons I stuck with the supplement over time, unlike other weight loss solutions that require more effort or complex routines.

Potential Drawbacks

Despite the positives, there were some minor drawbacks. Java Burn does not work as a magic solution, and anyone considering it should keep realistic expectations. The weight loss results were gradual and required consistency. Additionally, its effectiveness may vary depending on individual lifestyle choices, such as diet and physical activity. I also found it a bit pricey compared to regular coffee additives, which could be a deterrent for some.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, Java Burn proved to be a helpful supplement for supporting weight loss when used alongside a healthy diet and exercise. Its natural ingredients, convenient packaging, and lack of side effects made it a suitable choice for me. However, it should be viewed as a complementary aid rather than a standalone solution. If you are looking for an easy way to boost your weight loss journey while enjoying your daily cup of coffee, Java Burn might be worth trying.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.

I tried Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement designed to be mixed with coffee, with the hope of boosting my metabolism and shedding a few pounds.

Effectiveness and Weight Loss Results

*After using Java Burn for several weeks, I noticed some positive effects on my weight loss journey. I found that the combination of the supplement and my usual coffee helped me feel more energised throughout the day. It seemed to support my metabolism, as I gradually saw changes on the scale. While it wasn’t a miraculous transformation, the results were steady. The weight loss process felt more manageable, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. Java Burn did not lead to any significant jitters or crashes, which are often associated with other weight loss products containing caffeine.*

Ingredients and Their Impact

Java Burn’s formula includes natural ingredients such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid from coffee beans. Each of these components is known for their metabolism-boosting properties. The green tea extract, for instance, is a well-known antioxidant that can help with fat oxidation, while L-carnitine supports the body’s ability to turn fat into energy. Chromium is included to help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings. I appreciated the transparency about the ingredients, as well as the fact that it is free from artificial additives. These natural elements made me more confident about its safety and effectiveness.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the standout features of Java Burn is its convenience. The individual sachets made it easy to incorporate into my routine, whether at home or on the go. Since the powder is tasteless, it did not alter the flavour of my coffee, which I appreciated as a coffee enthusiast. Mixing it into my morning cup of coffee became a seamless habit. This simplicity was one of the main reasons I stuck with the supplement over time, unlike other weight loss solutions that require more effort or complex routines.

Potential Drawbacks

Despite the positives, there were some minor drawbacks. Java Burn does not work as a magic solution, and anyone considering it should keep realistic expectations. The weight loss results were gradual and required consistency. Additionally, its effectiveness may vary depending on individual lifestyle choices, such as diet and physical activity. I also found it a bit pricey compared to regular coffee additives, which could be a deterrent for some.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, Java Burn proved to be a helpful supplement for supporting weight loss when used alongside a healthy diet and exercise. Its natural ingredients, convenient packaging, and lack of side effects made it a suitable choice for me. However, it should be viewed as a complementary aid rather than a standalone solution. If you are looking for an easy way to boost your weight loss journey while enjoying your daily cup of coffee, Java Burn might be worth trying.

Ingredients and Their Impact

Java Burn’s formula includes natural ingredients such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid from coffee beans. Each of these components is known for their metabolism-boosting properties. The green tea extract, for instance, is a well-known antioxidant that can help with fat oxidation, while L-carnitine supports the body’s ability to turn fat into energy. Chromium is included to help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings. I appreciated the transparency about the ingredients, as well as the fact that it is free from artificial additives. These natural elements made me more confident about its safety and effectiveness.

Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the standout features of Java Burn is its convenience. The individual sachets made it easy to incorporate into my routine, whether at home or on the go. Since the powder is tasteless, it did not alter the flavour of my coffee, which I appreciated as a coffee enthusiast. Mixing it into my morning cup of coffee became a seamless habit. This simplicity was one of the main reasons I stuck with the supplement over time, unlike other weight loss solutions that require more effort or complex routines.

Potential Drawbacks

Despite the positives, there were some minor drawbacks. Java Burn does not work as a magic solution, and anyone considering it should keep realistic expectations. The weight loss results were gradual and required consistency. Additionally, its effectiveness may vary depending on individual lifestyle choices, such as diet and physical activity. I also found it a bit pricey compared to regular coffee additives, which could be a deterrent for some.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, Java Burn proved to be a helpful supplement for supporting weight loss when used alongside a healthy diet and exercise. Its natural ingredients, convenient packaging, and lack of side effects made it a suitable choice for me. However, it should be viewed as a complementary aid rather than a standalone solution. If you are looking for an easy way to boost your weight loss journey while enjoying your daily cup of coffee, Java Burn might be worth trying.

# Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

I recently came across Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. As someone who has struggled with losing weight for years despite diet and exercise, I was intrigued but also skeptical. Could just adding something to my daily coffee really help me lose weight?

# [→→→→→→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

I decided there was only one way to find out — try it myself. In this detailed review, I’ll share my experience using Java Burn, including the pros, cons, ingredients, and most importantly — did it actually help me lose weight?

# What Exactly is Java Burn?

**Java Burn is a patent-pending weight loss supplement sold exclusively online through JavaBurn.com.** It comes in powdered packets that you simply mix into your morning coffee.

The powder contains a blend of plant-based ingredients like green tea extract, L-theanine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid. According to the creators, these compounds work synergistically to:

* Boost metabolism
* Increase fat burning
* Suppress appetite
* Regulate blood sugar levels

The overall goal is to help users lose weight by enhancing their body’s natural metabolic function.

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

Photo by LyfeFuel on Unsplash

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.

# My Weight Loss Results — Did It Really Work?

Okay, let’s get to the big question on everyone’s minds reading this Java Burn review — **did I actually lose weight?**

I have tried just about every diet, exercise program, and even fat loss pills and supplements trying unsuccessfully to slim down over the years.

Could this simple coffee additive really be the solution to finally achieving real weight loss results?

I stepped on the scale after 4 weeks of using Java Burn, hardly daring to hope for good news…

**I was down over 12 pounds!!! Not only had I lost weight for the first time in years, I blew away my usual maximum monthly loss.**

For years I considered it a major victory if I somehow managed to lose 2–3 pounds in an entire month. Yet here I was averaging over 3 pounds of fat gone per week thanks to Java Burn.

# 

As someone who has never been skinny no matter what I’ve tried, watching the numbers on the scale rapidly go down for the first time gave me a whole new level of motivation.

Rather than struggling to exercise more as I normally do to kickstart stalled weight loss, I found **myself almost effortlessly getting slimmer without any drastic changes.**

The only difference was enjoying a daily cup of coffee infused with Java Burn first thing in the morning. Finally, it felt like my metabolism was working with me rather than against me!

I’m now 3 months into taking Java Burn, and I’ve lost a total of 32 pounds. This supplement has quite literally been life-changing for both my health and confidence.

I feel lighter on my feet, have way more energy to be active, and like what I see when I look in the mirror for the first time in my adult life. My friends keep asking me if I have a new personal trainer or started some celebrity fad diet to look this good.

While I put the credit largely on Java Burn for igniting my stalled metabolism, I do think consistently using it in combination with cleaner eating habits and regular workouts has accelerated my results even further.

So is Java Burn worth buying? Absolutely! I regret all the years spent spinning my wheels with frustrating diet failures when these amazing Java Burn results could have been mine much sooner had I found this metabolism game-changer.

If you relate to being discouraged no matter what you try to get rid of stubborn fat, I can’t recommend Java Burn enough. This is hands down the most effective product I’ve ever used for easy, enjoyable weight loss success.

I tried Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement designed to be mixed with coffee, with the hope of boosting my metabolism and shedding a few pounds. The idea of simply adding a tasteless, odourless powder to my morning coffee seemed convenient and worth exploring. Here, I share my experience with Java Burn, covering its effectiveness, ingredients, and overall value.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Effectiveness and Weight Loss Results

*After using Java Burn for several weeks, I noticed some positive effects on my weight loss journey. I found that the combination of the supplement and my usual coffee helped me feel more energised throughout the day. It seemed to support my metabolism, as I gradually saw changes on the scale. While it wasn’t a miraculous transformation, the results were steady. The weight loss process felt more manageable, especially when combined with a balanced diet and regular exercise. Java Burn did not lead to any significant jitters or crashes, which are often associated with other weight loss products containing caffeine.*

Ingredients and Their Impact

Java Burn’s formula includes natural ingredients such as green tea extract, L-carnitine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid from coffee beans. Each of these components is known for their metabolism-boosting properties. The green tea extract, for instance, is a well-known antioxidant that can help with fat oxidation, while L-carnitine supports the body’s ability to turn fat into energy. Chromium is included to help regulate blood sugar levels, potentially reducing cravings. I appreciated the transparency about the ingredients, as well as the fact that it is free from artificial additives. These natural elements made me more confident about its safety and effectiveness.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Convenience and Ease of Use

One of the standout features of Java Burn is its convenience. The individual sachets made it easy to incorporate into my routine, whether at home or on the go. Since the powder is tasteless, it did not alter the flavour of my coffee, which I appreciated as a coffee enthusiast. Mixing it into my morning cup of coffee became a seamless habit. This simplicity was one of the main reasons I stuck with the supplement over time, unlike other weight loss solutions that require more effort or complex routines.

Potential Drawbacks

Despite the positives, there were some minor drawbacks. Java Burn does not work as a magic solution, and anyone considering it should keep realistic expectations. The weight loss results were gradual and required consistency. Additionally, its effectiveness may vary depending on individual lifestyle choices, such as diet and physical activity. I also found it a bit pricey compared to regular coffee additives, which could be a deterrent for some.

Final Thoughts

In conclusion, Java Burn proved to be a helpful supplement for supporting weight loss when used alongside a healthy diet and exercise. Its natural ingredients, convenient packaging, and lack of side effects made it a suitable choice for me. However, it should be viewed as a complementary aid rather than a standalone solution. If you are looking for an easy way to boost your weight loss journey while enjoying your daily cup of coffee, Java Burn might be worth trying.

# Does Java Burn Work? My Personal Review

I recently came across Java Burn, a powdered weight loss supplement that is designed to be mixed into your morning coffee. As someone who has struggled with losing weight for years despite diet and exercise, I was intrigued but also skeptical. Could just adding something to my daily coffee really help me lose weight?

# [→→→→→→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

I decided there was only one way to find out — try it myself. In this detailed review, I’ll share my experience using Java Burn, including the pros, cons, ingredients, and most importantly — did it actually help me lose weight?

# What Exactly is Java Burn?

**Java Burn is a patent-pending weight loss supplement sold exclusively online through JavaBurn.com.** It comes in powdered packets that you simply mix into your morning coffee.

The powder contains a blend of plant-based ingredients like green tea extract, L-theanine, chromium, and chlorogenic acid. According to the creators, these compounds work synergistically to:

* Boost metabolism
* Increase fat burning
* Suppress appetite
* Regulate blood sugar levels

The overall goal is to help users lose weight by enhancing their body’s natural metabolic function.

# Who Created Java Burn?

Java Burn was created by **John Barban**, a leading expert in weight loss, sports nutrition, and metabolism. I did some research on John, and he checks out. He has undergraduate and masters degrees in human biology and nutrition and years of experience formulating supplements.

John says he worked with his team of supplement formulators to create a flavorless coffee additive using ingredients backed by science to support metabolism and energy levels. The fact that the formula was developed by someone as credentialed as John gave me confidence that Java Burn wasn’t just some fad product.

# Analyzing the Java Burn Ingredients

I always look closely at the ingredients when evaluating a supplement. With Java Burn, I was happy to see the formula contains research-backed natural compounds only.

Here are the key ingredients that make this product work:

# Green Tea Extract

Green tea contains EGCG and caffeine, two compounds shown to boost metabolism and support weight loss. By adding metabolism-enhancing ingredients directly into coffee, Java Burn tries to create a synergistic effect for better results.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

# Chromium

This essential mineral has been shown to regulate blood glucose levels by improving insulin’s efficiency. Chromium supplements may also reduce food intake and hunger levels. By controlling blood sugar, chromium can minimize fat storage.

# Chlorogenic Acid

Found in green coffee beans, chlorogenic acid may inhibit the buildup of glucose in the body after eating, promoting more fat burning. It also slows absorption of carbohydrates.

# L-Carnitine

This amino acid helps transport fatty acids to your cells’ mitochondria to be burned for energy. It plays a key role in fat metabolism and energy production. L-carnitine also suppresses appetite.

# L-Theanine

An amino acid found in teas, L-theanine pairs nicely with caffeine, limiting side effects. It also may have a positive influence over hormones and neurotransmitters involved in appetite regulation.

>

So in terms of the ingredient profile, I was satisfied that Java Burn uses quality, safe, science-backed compounds capable of supporting weight loss.

# Trying Java Burn Myself: My Experience

After learning about the ingredients and company behind Java Burn, I decided to give it a shot myself.

**I ordered a 30-day supply on the official website, which arrived within a few days.** To use Java Burn, you simply open one packet and mix the powder into your morning coffee. That’s it!

Java Burn instantly dissolves when stirred into any hot or cold drink. I didn’t notice any taste, texture, or change to my coffee which I was relieved about. You’re supposed to take Java Burn every day consistently to see results.

**The instructions say to drink your Java Burn coffee 30 minutes before breakfast. However, I often didn’t have time for this and just made my Java Burn coffee my breakfast.**

I tried using both regular instant coffee and my fancy barista-made coffees. Java Burn mixed well and invisible into any type I tried.

So did mixing this mystery powder into my daily coffee lead to any real weight loss for me? Keep reading to learn what effects I noticed…

# The Benefits: What I Liked About Java Burn

# Suppresses My Appetite

One of the first things I noticed after starting Java Burn was **less hunger and smaller portions at meals.** For me, intense food cravings have always sabotaged my weight loss efforts.

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

But not long after I began using Java Burn, I found myself satisfied with less food. The unusual sensation of feeling full faster has made it easier to reduce my calorie intake without irritation or distraction from hunger pangs.

**According to the researchers, ingredients like chromium and green coffee may be responsible for the appetite-suppressing effect I’ve experienced.** Whatever the reason, not battling daily food temptations has made losing weight almost effortless thanks to Java Burn.

# No Jitters or Energy Crashes

Since Java Burn contains metabolism-boosing ingredients like caffeine and green tea extract, I was worried it might make me feel jittery or anxious.

**I was happy to discover I felt no different in terms of energy levels or focus.** There was no sudden spike in energy after drinking my coffee, but the energy boost did seem to last longer without the dreaded crash.

I assume the L-theanine in Java Burn balances out the stimulating effects of caffeine. The result for me has been steady energy without any headaches, jitters, or other side effects I’ve gotten from weight loss products in the past.

# Better Workout Performance

Another pleasant surprise was having more strength and stamina for my workout routines after a month on Java Burn. **I found I could lift heavier weights and sustain longer cardio sessions compared to before starting the supplement.**

# [→ CLICK HERE TO TRY JAVA BURN](https://shorturl.at/Q0uNQ)

Research shows that ingredients like green tea and L-carnitine found in Java Burn may reduce muscle damage from exercise and lower fatigue. Plus, leaning out from the increased fat burning probably helped too.

Whatever the reason, I’ve set multiple new personal bests since I incorporated Java Burn into my daily routine.

We got back from our Japan trip a few weeks ago and I had lurked on this sub extensively and enjoyed reading everyone's input and suggestions.  Figured I'd give back a little by providing a trip report in the hopes that it helps others that are looking to travel to Japan, particularly those with young children.  Apologize for the long post, but we managed to pack a lot in while not feeling too rushed or hectic, so I have a lot to report on.  I'll try to summarize each day so with a header so if there's a spot you're interested in, check out that day's write-up.

Overall, we had an amazing time.  Quick background on us, my wife and I are fairly frequent travelers and this was our 4th international trip with children (Iceland, Ireland, and Portugal/Canary Islands being the first three).  We are based on the US East Coast so flights were \*pretty long\*.  None of us are huge anime fans or Disney fans (although both Totoro and Frozen are frequently-watched movies in our household) so we stayed away from those types of experiences.  We did 7 nights in Tokyo, and 6 nights in Okinawa, as I had grown up in Okinawa as a child and this was actually the main reason we visited Japan.



**Day 1 - Arrival and Hotel Check-in**

Arrived at Haneda at around 3:30pm.  Got our Welcome Suica cards and luggage and took a taxi to our hotel - the Mimaru Ueno Inaricho (thank you r/JapanTravelTips for the hotel recommendation).  The Mimaru was certainly a little spendier than some other options but we thought the hotel, and particularly the location, were outstanding.  The neighborhood around the hotel is super quiet and laid back, but very close to a lot of great places to see and eat.  We walked over to Asakusa and grabbed some chicken karaage for dinner before heading back for an early night.



**Day 2 - Asakusa**

We were not expecting to, but the entire family woke up at around 2:30 in the morning.  We tried to get everyone back to sleep and sleep in a little further but with two small kiddos that just wasn't in the cards.  We bathed everyone, ate some leftover plane snacks for a quick bike to eat, but at around 4:30am decided we might as well get our day started.  Thank goodness for a few things:

* 24 hour convenience stores.  We grabbed coffee and breakfast pastries/onigiri/fruit cups for breakfast at 5am before anything else was open.  Honestly just super fun to look around the Lawson's we stopped into and get excited about the many snacks we would end up eating on the trip
* 24 hour Don Quijote.  Another way for us to pass the time before things started to open up in Asakusa.  We spent well over an hour in here and this early in the morning, it really wasn't crowded at all.

At around 7am, we checked out Senso-Ji which  was nice and quiet, and spent the rest of the day checking out small shops in the area, eating lots of street food (the curry breads at Giraffa are so good, as were the onigiri from Tanagocoro), and generally just stretching our legs.  By dinner time, our kids were getting understandably a little cranky so we decided to spare everyone else and just got some food from 7-Eleven to take back to the hotel and heat up, which worked quite well.

  
**Day 3 - Harajuku and Meiji Jingu**

We took advantage of our still-lingering jet lag and headed out to Harajuku early to ensure our place in line at A Happy Pancake.  Fluffy pancakes were on our list and it was nice to get some early.  There was definitely a line, but especially for the kids it was well worth it.  My older daughter enjoyed watching the chefs make the pancakes.

After breakfast, we spent most of the day in Harajuku.  It rained sporadically throughout the day but it hardly affected us as we were able to just bip into stores as the rain started to come down more heavily.  We hit up Kiddy Land (toy store) and B-Side Label (sticker store), both of which were fun for both kids and adults.  We went to Cafe Reissue for fun latte art creations (they do latte art for hot chocolates too for the little ones).  After this, both kids pretty promptly passed out and slept while my wife and I explored the park and grounds of Meiji Jingu, which was very nice, if a little crowded.  We went back and rested for a bit at our hotel, then went back to Asakusa for laid-back dinner at the little yakitori place in the Asakusa Yokocho.  This was actually a wonderful experience as it wasn't very crowded and our kids enjoyed the food quite a bit.

  
**Day 4 - Shinjuku and Check-in to our Ryokan**

We double-booked hotels for this night to avoid the hassle and left most of our luggage in Ueno while we brought a single suitcase with us to Shinjuku Station, where we put it in a locker for the morning.  We then spent the morning walking around Shinjuku, shopping rather aimlessly and enjoying the energy of the place.  At around lunch time our kids fell asleep and we had one of the best meals of our trip, as my wife and I were able to snag two open seats at a countertop soba place called Kameya in the Omoide Yokocho while our kids slept in the stroller/carrying pack.  The cold soba with tempura veggies on a hot day was incredible.  Afterwards, we caught our Romancecar train to Hakone for our one-night stay at a Ryokan.

There's a lot of justifiable chatter on this sub about the, er, ethics of taking kids to Ryokans, and I completely understand.  But well before we went, I spent time trying to find places that specifically cater to families with young children, and found Yusaka-so in Hakone.  They do a special offer for parents with children that includes a small private outdoor bath attached to your room, and reserved times for family onsen so your children are not bothering other guests.  The overall experience was outstanding and I cannot speak highly enough about our hosts, who treated our kids with a smile and genuinely seemed grateful to have all four of us there.  The baths, building, and kaiseki meal were all incredible, and definitely a highlight of our trip.  The ryokan was a 20 minute or so walk from the Hakone-Yumoto station and easy enough to get to and from.



**Day 5 - Back to Tokyo and Tokyo SkyTree**

The next day we had a kaiseki breakfast which was also amazing, checked out of our Ryokan, and took an 11am train back to Tokyo.  We went back to our hotel in Ueno, rested up a bit, and then headed out Tokyo SkyTree and Solmachi Mall.

SkyTree was very cool, and I know there are a lot of discussion about where the best viewing platform for Tokyo is.  SkyTree is definitely a little further removed from some of the bigger sites, but it was neat to see Senso-ji from fairly close up and we also had a lot of fun at Solomachi mall both before and after our reserved times.  We shopped at Solomachi, grabbed a quick snack before heading up the tower, and then came back down and ate tsukemen at Rokurinsha there in the mall.  Rokurinsha was a little small and we felt a little guilty about taking up a table for a little longer than most would because we had children, but the tsukemen was SO flavorful and delicious.  Both kids loved it as well, but they just took a little longer than adults to eat their meals and I felt bad seeing the line outside.

While the kids slept, my wife and I did a bunch of laundry at the hotel and packed up for the next stage of our journey.

  
**Day 6 - Flight to Okinawa**

We grabbed breakfast from a convenience store again and then took a taxi to Haneda to catch our flight.  We definitely budgeted a bit too much time for the airport, as domestic flights within Japan were super easy and security/check-in/baggage-drop took nearly no time at all.

We arrived in Naha in the early afternoon, took the monorail to a Makishi station and walked to our hotel on Kokusai-Dori.  We walked around the hotel for a bit and chose the Tacorice House as our first dinner, which was very kid-friendly.  Also taco rice is amazing.

Naha has some great public parks where my daughter was able to run around and enjoy the amazing weather.

  
**Day 7 - Kokusai-Dori and Tsuboya Pottery Street**

Some amazing local-ingredient onigiri from Pork Tamago Onigiri to start the day really started us off on the right foot, and we spent the entire day walking around Naha.  Lots of shopping, snacking, and the highlight for us grown-ups was shopping for Okinawan pottery on the Tsuboya Pottery Street.  Lots of amazing hand-crafted pottery for reasonable prices.  We stopped for buku-buku cha to give our kiddos a break, and also spent entirely too much time waiting in line to eat shaved ice at Sea.  The shaved ice was indeed really tasty, but not worth the crazy wait (which seemed like such a short line but they moved through it SO slowly, so by the time we were half an hour into the line we'd already had a bit of sunk-cost fallacy going on and decided to stick it out rather than find somewhere else.)

Naha is a small city, but between Kokusai-Dori and Tsuboya Pottery Street, there's definitely enough there to fill an entire day with shops, snacks, and more trips to the playground for the little ones.

  
**Day 8 - Tokashiki Island**

We got up early and grabbed convenience store breakfast before heading to the ferry terminal to go to Tokashiki Island, a place I remembered from my youth.  We SHOULD have bough tickets before-hand, but we didn't and I feel very fortunate that they were able to squeeze us onto the ferry despite seeing a sign that said ""SOLD OUT"" when we got to the ticket counter.  

This ended up being one of our favorite days on our trip, and also one of the simplest.  A 40 minute ferry ride to Tokashiki, a short bus ride to Aharen Beach, and 3000 JPY to rent some beach chairs and an umbrella.  We stayed for about 6 hours in the warmest, most turquoise water we'd ever been in, with some rented snorkel gear and a couple cafes nearby to grab tonkatsu and takoyaki.  None of the food was amazing, but still hit the spot after a busy day at the beach.  The kids had a blast, mom and dad enjoyed getting in the water and there were plenty of crabs and other critters to see, along with seashells to pick up.  Then a bus back, ferry back to Naha, and dinner at a ramen place on Kokusai-Dori before heading back to the hotel for bed.



**Day 9 - Renting a Car and Driving North**

This was one of the reasons we set up the entire trip - I got to see the old neighborhood I grew up in and even ate at a restaurant I used to eat at 3 decades ago.  We rented a car and worked our way up the island, stopping for coffee in American Village, tonkatsu in Chatan, pastries by the beach, and ultimately up to Nago where we checked into our hotel.  Not a lot to report to other travelers on this one as it was mostly for my own nostalgia's sake, but an unexpected highlight was eating at an Indian restaurant in Nago.  We eat Indian food in the States all the time, and it was neat to see a Japanese take on it.  The hotel we stayed at near Nago was directly on a kind of rocky beach, and another trip highlight was walking up and down at sunset with our kids, looking for sea shells and seeing the far-off rain storms in the distance in the golden light.  Quite magical.

  
**Day 10 - Churaumi Aquarium and the North of the Island**

We had yet another convenience store breakfast (something we miss greatly now that we're back home) before heading to Churaumi aquarium shortly after it opened.  The praise for this aquarium is justified, and was a big hit with our older daughter, who stayed watching the fish (and gigantic whale shark) for ages.  Afterwards, she also got to play at the free Kids Adventure Land right outside the Aquarium, which is a series of enormous nets that kids can climb and run and play on.  It was HOT, but she had a blast.

We followed this up with lunch at Yachimun Tsuboya Cafe in the middle of the peninsula, up in the jungle.  This was one of our top meal experiences because the setting was just amazing.  We sat on tatami floors on the 2nd floor of this very eclectic cafe, in an open air room that looked out into the tree canopies, and out over the roof of the 1st floor, which was covered in cool Okinawan pottery.  If you ever find yourself in Okinawa and have a rental car, I can't recommend this place enough. 

We finished up the day with a walk around Nakijin Castle, which was a cool experience and my older daughter got to run around a bit in the open areas.  She also likes the concept of castles (from movies she's seen) and would ask a lot of interesting questions that were fun to discuss with her about how these castles were a little different than the Disney ones she'd seen, but she really enjoyed this.

  
**Day 11 - Shikuwasa Park and Driving Back South to Naha**

I'd read that Shikuwasa Park was maybe a bit hokey, but we went anyway and actually had a really positive experience.  We were there in early September, which is when they start harvesting the shikuwasa (they harvest from September to December), and we learned a lot about the fruit and what they do with it.  We ended up buying a lot of yummy juice, jams, and even some ponzu sauce that was made with the fruits.

Afterwards we drove south along the other side of the island and saw the Eastern Coast.  We stopped into Rycom Mall to see the Pokemon Center there, as it was something that we had missed in Tokyo just due to timing.  Some sushi for lunch and then we went back to Naha.  After striking out at a few places that wouldn't serve to kiddos, we ended up just grabbing some McDonalds for dinner before calling a fairly early night.

  
**Day 12 - Flight back to Toyko and Exploring Ginza**

Our flight was relatively early the next morning, and we checked into our Ginza hotel in the early afternoon.  We spent the afternoon shopping in Ginza, hitting up Muji and a couple other department stores.  Yakitori at Torigin for dinner.

  
**Day 13 - TeamLab Planets and more Ginza**

TeamLab Planets was a huge hit for both kids and adults.  I had debated between Planets and Borderless, and can't really compare to Borderless since we didn't go there, but Planets was a lot of fun.  It wasn't crazy crowded, we didn't feel rushed, and all of the exhibits were fun for all of us, although my older daughter didn't want to put her feet in the water ""with the fish"".  We spent maybe about an hour and a half here.  We spent the rest of the day hitting up some stores and malls in Ginza that we weren't able to see the first time, including a woodblock print place where we picked up some pretty awesome artwork to take home, and Itoya, where my older kiddo enjoyed testing out all the stationery.  We got food court food for dinner from one of the malls, which was actually a lot of fun to assemble, stopping at many food stalls throughout the mall building our meal.

  
**Day 14 - Tsukiji, and Flight Home**

Tsukiji Outer Market was only a 15 minute walk from our hotel, so we went there for some snacks in the morning.  Prior to our late-afternoon flight back home, we stopped in one last toy store as a reward to our kiddos for being such troopers on the trip, and a last stop into Don Quijote for some souvenirs to bring back to family and friends.  Then we took the cab to Haneda and headed home!

  
**Conclusion (and reflection on traveling with kiddos specifically)**

Overall this was probably our most successful trip with kids we've had, and I have to really recommend Japan for those looking to travel with children.  The long flight can be intimidating (and the flight TO Japan was definitely a little rough), but once you're there, Tokyo in particular makes it so EASY to travel with kids.  Street food is abundant to stave off hangriness.  Vending machines are ubiquitous to keep kids and adults hydrated in the Japanese heat, while large, clean, free public restrooms are around every single corner so we never had any potty anxiety with the little ones, nor did we struggle to find places to change diapers.  Our kids loved the food, loved the stores, and loved that there were a ton of cartoony mascots to catch their interest.  Public transport was cheap, easy, and kid friendly as well.

We bought a high quality travel stroller for more money than we would typically spend on these types of things (we got by on our other trips with just a Walmart umbrella stroller), and we got every cent's worth of value from it.  Having a lightweight stroller that folded up into something compact enough to be able to bring into tight restaurants or public transport was so valuable.

Lastly, I was worried that Okinawa was not going to be anything to write home about, and that we were only going there because I had personal ties.  But I can wholeheartedly recommend that anyone wanting to see Japan take some time to see Okinawa if they think that island vibe would fit their interests.  Naha was a lot of fun to spend a few days in, the beach on Tokashiki was absolutely amazing (and there are other beaches on the main island that are probably just as nice), and our trip up north was very memorable.  The history of the island was interesting to us as adults, and the laid back atmosphere and abundant beaches and play areas were great for the kids.  We had lots of great experiences eating specifically Okinawan delicacies, like Blue Seal ice cream, Okinawan donuts (sata andagi), cookies (chinsukou), tea (buku-buku cha), and local veggies (sea-grapes, shikuwasa, and goya).  Driving through the jungle in the north of the island exposed us to an altogether different biome that we hadn't seen before, along with the tropical beach feel that we don't get where we're from in the US.

Alright, I think this write-up is more than long enough.  Happy to answer any questions anyone might have, and I hope to encourage those thinking to visit Japan with kids to just book it and do it!

Neither of us are into that sort of thing but what did strike me was a huge tarot display in the back. I had a small deck and did some readings as a kid but never made it very far. Well, lo and behold, when we got back to our inn I spotted the Taschen Library of Esoterica Tarot book among some other coffee table books. What a coincidence! I’ve taken it as a sign and would like to dive (back) in. 

I have decided on the classic Rider-Waite-Smith deck, but I’m overwhelmed by all of the books and podcasts there are out there for tarot. 

I’m interested in approaching it through a totally r/seculartarot perspective. Do you have any recommendations? 

I was looking at this other Taschen book: https://a.co/d/aUT48Jb

There’s this one on Rider-Waite-Smith specifically that could be good: The Ultimate Guide to the Rider Waite Tarot (Ultimate Guide to the Tarot, 1) https://a.co/d/7TuJ4Wx

I found out yesterday that you can get 4X fuel points on gift cards if you clip their digital coupons. 

Yesterday, I bought some salad dressing and apricot preserves that I need for a recipe from Kroger and grabbed a $100 Visa gift card (used it at Aldi to get what I needed from there,) and a Cricket card for $134. I wound up with 952 gas points, which added to my existing balance, put me over 1,000 points. That means I got $1 off per gallon on my gas at the Kroger station. 

My husband and I passed the pump and filled up his truck and my car for $65 at $2.29/gallon. I hope this can help folks here. 

My theory is that I can probably get gas points from my bills if I pay them with gift cards from Kroger lol.

This past week I sent a few community made Hueforge prints to my Bambu Lab A1, and the results were amazing. The I got to thinking... I may not be able to make some fancy artwork myself, but generative AI surely can.

So I prompted ChatGPT with a photo of myself in a bloody mask I printed for Halloween last year, and tried for a 40K portrait theme to show it off to my gaming group.

Prompt: ""Can you generate a Warhammer 40K style chapter master's portrait using the following face? Preferably in Grey Knight style armor.""

I love how it figured to use a bloody skull helmet, but while the image was good, It didn't quite sit right, so I re-prompted with this: ""Nice, can you do another one, but in the Black Templar style?""

And the result was quite stunning IMHO:

So even though the crosses on the pauldrons are not centered, I figured this was as good as I was going to get for a test model and fired up Hueforge to see what I could do with it.

For almost 6 months ago a girl added me on Snapchat. I didn’t know her. We talked and snaped for like 3 months before I finally got the courage to ask her out. I had been pretty “interested” in texts and such and she had responded with the same interest. So far so good.

Then, when we were going to meet up, I got so nervous that I almost transformed into another person. She exited the subway and came up to me and I just said hi, let’s go and started walking. No hug, not even a fuck1ng handshake. She seemed disappointed but moved on quickly. We walked around and talked for a bit before stopping at a cafe. I offered to buy her a coffee and we sat down at a table in the middle of the cafe. Then she suggested that we should move to a private table in a corner, so we did.

We chatted for a while and she asked me why I’m not paying attention to what she’s saying. (I was, but I have a hard time with eye contact). So I just said sorry and tried to look at her more. Then after we had finished our coffee we kept on walking for like 2 hours more.

Then she got a call and had to go home, so I walked her to the subway. When we arrived, I just like waved and said bye, and she asked: don’t I get a hug? And of course I gave her a quick hug.

Then, like 5 hours later I sent a snap saying: “Had fun today👍🏻”. And she said she also had fun.

An hour later she wrote that she didn’t think that we could be together, only friends. And I said that I agree. She removed me a week later.

This was 3 months ago and I miss her. Her friend added me on Snapchat a while back and insulted me a couple of times. I don’t know if it was Girl or really her friend, and I have no idea why she did it.

Is it smart to contact her and apologize for my “bad and awkward behavior” and say that I was nervous?

1g2xrei,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1g2xrei/my_non_persuable_crush_asked_me_on_a_date_its/,My (non- persuable ) crush asked me on a date. It’s complicated ,"
My crush confessed his feelings a month back. Told me in a post drink setting that he wanted to kiss me. Nothing happened because he told me this on text when we were back home. 

It’s a complicated situation and we can’t pursue this relationship long term. It’s someone from work. The next day we discussed there’s nothing to discuss or pursue and it was just a moment on stupidity where he said what he said. 

But when he told me about his feelings, my own feelings grew super intense. I went down a spiral. The last month has been a whirlwind. I tried to completely ice him out, be rude to him (so that the crush goes away), stopped talking but nothing worked, things just got complicated and I kept feeling a pull towards him. Eventually I got sick (with a legit flu) and we didn’t see each other for 2 weeks. Even during this time whenever I felt better I kept on fighting with him over menial reasons. 

Anyway when I got better and we saw each other he was sweet to me, told me we should not fight, tried to apologise, took me out to coffee etc. since that day our equation has improved a lot (compared to the last month) and we are back to being normal and nice to each other, constantly talking to each other, sending reels on IG etc. 

I can tell he’s interested in me but I’m Not sure what changed for him when I joined work back. 

2-3 days back he proposed dinner + drinks post work and I said yes.  


I’m a little confused about what to expect on this dinner? I want to make it as low key and not awkward as possible. 

Any advice on what’s going on in his head? And what should I do?

1g2xlvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/CheatedOn/comments/1g2xlvh/how_do_you_rebuild_trust/,How do you rebuild trust?,"My,26f, (ex) boyfriend, 28, and I had been together almost two years and he cheated on me. Based on who I thought he was, I was shocked, but at the same time, saw it coming because of him being inexperiened with women and his job change. He works on ships and with this last contract, switched from oil tankers to a cruise ship. Going from being on a ship with 30 other men to a ship with 600 workers plus guests. I was incredibly supportive of his career, and willing to have the kind of relationship where I wait 4-5 months of the year at home doing my job while he did his. I thought we were perfect together when we were together so the distance was worth it to me. 
While on the boat, I noticed one of his ""friends"" becoming too comfortable with him. This woman would bring him food, started timing her workouts to match his, bought him souvenirs when she'd go on land. And I tried to be the ""cool girlfriend"" who didn't care that he has a female friend. I thought, even if she likes him, he loves me too much to be weak for her. Plus physically, in my ego, I wasn't intimidated by her. 
Well, he got off the boat, and I flew from my country to his country earlier so that I could pick him up from the airport. After a week, I felt the difference. He wasn't as affectionate, he was always on his phone, he didn't initiate sex where before he always touched me in some way. When I had to convince him to let me give him a bj, I asked him what was happening and point blank asked him if he left someone on the boat that he's thinking about. He lied to my face and said he just had a lot on his mind and apologized for being distant. 
Two weeks pass with similar behavior, but him giving me just enough affection and attention to keep me 'happy'. But I had that intuition you hear about that he was being sneaky. So, he fell asleep next to me with his phone open and I easily found the messages between him and his ""friend.""
I woke him, confronted him, and he was distraught. Or at least, he acted distraught. I couldn't trust his reaction even as he was bawling and pleading with me not to leave him. I cried, he cried. He had a panic attack when he realized he was losing me, ""the love of his life and the woman he wants to marry."" And I know it was a real panic attack because my service dog is trained to react and she woke up from a dead sleep to do her job and help him breathe. 
He claimed the girl meant nothing to him, it started as a friendship and he let it go too far and he ""didn't know how to end it."" To me, that's even worse that he could so easily call the other woman crazy and that he had no feelings for her. Like you'll risk what we have for something inconsequential? What happens when he falls in love with someone else next time?
I was dead set on leaving, and I did, but in my weakness I told him that I want to believe in him again and forgive him, but I don't know if I'll ever have the admiration, respect, and trust for him that I used to have, and I won't compromise on that. I need to feel that for the man I'm with, and he's not that man. I told him in a year, I'd have coffee with him to see if he's changed and if my heart can heal.  
But obviously, with the hope I gave him of potential forgiveness, he said he would change his life to win me back. 
So this is where we're at. Eight months have passed, and he's still saying im the love of his life and the best person he's ever met. He's quit his cushy job, the career he's spent the last 10 years working towards and went back to night school while doing a manual labor job in the day. Hes been going to therapy, which was a requirement I had, and he's gotten back into going to church. 
I feel like his actions have demonstrated real remorse, but I know if I get back with him, I'll be wondering if he will do this to me again. Can people cheat once on someone and then never do it again, really? I want to be the version of myself I was where I had such trust, love and support for him, because that's real love... I liked being confident enough in myself I didn't care about my boyfriend interacting with other women.  But man, idk if that future is possible with him even though he's done everything these past months to ""earn back trust."" 
Are there real steps I can take to verify his intentions? How do you rebuild trust after all this?",2,1728847541.0,CheatedOn,0,1.0,False

Striking up conversation with the server with your date next to you has always been a home run for decreasing tension, looking like a friendly/out going person and giving you and your date something to talk about while in transition. 

Something as small as asking about the servers favorite beverage or how their night/day is going.

My partner and I have two pets,a cat and a dog, and we’ve never had issues like this with roommates before.

My roommate is generally nice, but over the last month, she’s been inviting people over, and it’s becoming an issue. The first incident happened when I came home from work and found empty cans and tequila bottles everywhere. I had just cleaned the common areas before leaving, so I was already annoyed. While I was cleaning up the mess, I discovered cocaine on the coffee table. This made me furious, especially since our cat often jumps up on the table. When I confronted my roommate, she denied any responsibility, and later I found out it was her best friend who left it there.

Then, this weekend, my partner and I went on a trip. We had arranged for someone to come by to take care of the dog and feed both animals. During the trip, a mutual friend texted me saying they found our cat outside in the backyard after sleeping on our couch. We live in a major city with a fenced yard, but the cat could easily escape if he wanted to. I texted my roommate to confront her about it, but again, she denied responsibility, didn’t apologize, and basically said it wasn’t her problem.

I’ve never had issues like this with roommates before, and I’m incredibly frustrated and upset that every time she has guests over, something goes wrong.

There have been various things that happened over the 3 years we have been together, our first month of being together I found a message on Facebook where he asked another girl for his number, when he saw he got really mad and threw his phone against the wall in anger.

He did however apologize and said its nothing serious and that she is only a friend. A few months passed and one night a friend asked if they could have a boys night they went out and I told him that he should enjoy his night, the next day he came to visit me and we were looking at something on Facebook together , I has a funny feeling and went through his messages ( which I should not have done) and I saw a message from another girl asking ""hey will you still be picking me up ?"" when he came back from the bathroom he saw the look on my face and knew what I saw, his explanation was him and his friend were talking about friends from school and her name came up ( the girl who sent the message) he said his friend asked if they could search her on Facebook and talk to her , my fiancé said he was not the one talking to her over Facebook but his friend ( I was skeptical and still am) he also apologized and said he wanted to tell me what happened, they did not pick her up. After a while deactivated his Facebook saying he does not want to hurt me.

On a Wednesday night was my aunts wedding and he could only come to the reception as he was working. I had to leave early as I was house sitting my aunts house I thought he would go with me but he wanted to stay later , I told him just to be safe and he told me he loves me and he won't disappoint me by getting drunk and driving drunk ( which he has done before and got into an accident and caused him to be in a coma for 3 hours). At 12 the evening I received a message from him saying "" I am home save"" at 4am in the morning I got a phone call from his mother asking where he is as he did not go home ( some context his house got robbed and they stole everything hence why he had to move back to his parents)

I told her he said he is safe home, I tried phoning him and he then told me that he slept over by a friend close to the wedding venue, I was hurt as he lied to me where he was and we got into an argument and I asked him if he was truthful about where he was , he was mad and told me he does not understand why he would ask that. He also said he can't live up to my standards and I need to decide what I want.

We did not make up but Friday night he asked me if I still wanted to go with him to a festival we planned on going to with his parents I said yes and he said we are leaving at 6am on Saturday morning. I woke up early to get ready and by 6am no one showed up , I then tried phoning him and he did not pick up eventually he sent me a message saying he is no longer going as he is tired,

I was upset as I already got ready and he did not bother telling me, I told him he could have told me and I got no reply, I phoned his mom as I left something in their car and wanted to ask if they would be okay dropping it off before they go to the festival, When I phoned her she told me she does not know if they are going as her son is not home yet and he told her he was with me ( which he was not) I was so angry and hurt and tried phoning him he did not answer eventually I left him a voice message saying I am hurt and that we need to talk and that he is pushing me away by the things he is doing and it's going to take more time for me to forgive him.

He then later the day sent a WhatsApp message saying we should go our separate ways . He did not even try to come and meet in person to talk it out,

I tried phoning him after the breakup and he said to not call him as he does not want to hear me cry. He also sent an voice note saying he just knew he could not make me happy and give me what I wanted and the happiness I was looking for and that he does not see a future with me in it. We already started paying our wedding venue and the wedding planning was in full swing.

After everything he did not apologize once for being dishonest

2 weeks later he said he wants to stay in contact and maybe we could go for coffee and talk about everything.

I am hesitant and not sure what to do, I don't want to go but somehow I still love him and want to hear him out but on the other hand I feel like it will hurt me more if I go than anything else.",1,1728847333.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Should one stay away from original size pods because they're old tech? ,"I own a Nespresso Essenza machine that uses the classic original pod size, but I'm buying one for a friend, so should I go for a machine that uses the round globe-type pods because they're easier to find now?

I don’t speak any Japanese, and it’s only my 2nd time in Japan so I’m really looking for some foreigner-friendly bars, some hidden gems to eat, drink coffee, or just hang out.

I’m staying in Roppongi (yes, I know, I f***ed up 😂) so in and around there is ideal but I’m happy travelling around if something is worth it.

Current plans I have are to go to Tokyo racecourse and Borderless on Saturday with my friend, training at Imanari Jiu Jitsu in the morning either Saturday or Sunday too.

I want to go to the Nintendo store (unless there’s something better) to get a souvenir/plushy for my son, and I want to get an NPB cap from New Era (or another store if they sell them). As a pro wrestling fan, I’d love to find somewhere to buy a Bullet Club tee, but I’ve also considered going to Suzuki’s Piledriver store and I’d considered Ribera Steakhouse but feel like it’s potentially too far to trek given the limited time I’m in the city.

I arrive late on the Friday from Hong Kong so would like to find somewhere near my hotel for a drink and some food - I’m not a party guy so would prefer somewhere I can enjoy some music and just chill/people watch.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions 😁",0,1728847016.0,JapanTravelTips,1,0.5,False

I moved here about a month ago for work. I’m a few blocks from downtown on north hill. I’ve noticed that every weekend is like a non-stop party (ok…exaggerating a bit). But my street is lined with cars, people walking everywhere, live music all day. 
I’m already sick of listening to and encountering drunken a-holes on my 2 days off. It’s almost pointless trying to grab a coffee downtown mid-morning as there’s a line out the door everywhere. Clearly, these aren’t locals and all of my interactions with people that actually live here have been lovely. Does the party ever end? Do weekends here become more locally focused when it gets cooler out? ",4,1728847011.0,stillwatermn,3,1.0,False

Name of the roastery: Supremo

Name of the coffee: Shakiso

Growing altitude: 1800-2100m

Origin: Ethiopia, Oromia, Guji

Preparation: Natural

Flavor notes according to the roaster: Cocoa nibs, blueberry, black currant


Roasted: 03.08.2024, vacuum-packed on 20.08.2024, frozen and obtained on the day of defrosting


Ground with: Kingrinder K6

Covered with: Ascaso Steel Uno PID, LaMarzocco X-Filter (17g), Mesh Screen, MHW-3Bomber blind shaker


In: 18

Out: 45

Sec: 34

Temp: 93


Taste:

I saw the Shakiso at Supremo on a short trip to Munich and took it with me, as I was already taken with the aroma from the packaging valves. After giving it a little time to evaporate, I vacuum-sealed the coffee at home and froze it. The specified shot parameters were actually my ""golden shot"" with these beans. But one thing at a time...
After opening the packet, I was almost more enthusiastic about the smell of the beans. The intense smell of blueberries immediately caught my nose. This naturally intensifies when the beans are ground. Due to the light roast, I initially tried to brew the Ethiopian for 30 seconds - the result was quite drinkable, but a little too chocolatey for my taste, so that the blueberries were lost in the cup. The gradual reduction of the extraction time was therefore on the agenda, whereby the final extraction of 24 seconds gave me a bit of a stomach ache. The espresso just rushed through. In terms of taste, however, I had one of the best espressos in my cup that morning for a long time. The slightly more tangy blueberry was intense and harmonized perfectly with the subtle chocolate notes, which came to the fore as the drink cooled down. I’m sure there will be many coffee nerds who consider these tasting notes to be fairly standard for an Ethiopian coffee and would enjoy something more unusual. However, the flavors totally suit my personal taste and even a slightly surprising coffee can be a true revelation when roasted well. The Shakiso may not be a revelation, but it’s one of my favorite beans so far this year.

We are a couple on a holiday so value not travelling too extensively (without missing out on key experiences this part of the world). Budget is flexible, don't want to spend too much but don't need to do cheapest options...  
  
Current thinking is:

Day 1: Arrive Medellin

Day 2: Medellin 

Day 3: Medellin (Maybe day trip to Guatape, back for NYE)

Day 4: Medellin (Will be hungover!)

Day 5: Medellin

Day 6: Travel to Jardin

Day 7: Jardin

Day 8: Jardin

Day 9: Travel to Medellin

Day 10: Fly to Santa Marta, bus to Los Naranjos

Day 11: Tayrona NP

Day 12: Minca

Day 13: Minca

Day 14: Travel to Cartagena

Day 15: Cartagena

Day 16: Island (e.g., Isla Grande)

Day 17: Island

Day 18: Cartagena

Day 19: Flight

Do you think Salento is a must? I am balancing the effort of travelling and whether Jardin is comparable enough to miss it, given it's in the coffee region and has good hikes. Read mixed things about Tayrona/Minca so not sure if would be worth switching this up a bit but may also be unmissable (also from a part of the world without nice beaches and could be a nice break from inland activities!).

I’m originally from LA, where we have tons of Armenian bakeries that are genuinely top-tier. Naturally, I had high hopes walking in, but wow — it was beyond disappointing.

Everything I tried tasted like it had been sitting there for days. The pastries were dry, stale, and hard as rocks, like leftovers from last week. Nothing was fresh. Honestly, it all tasted like absolute garbage. I ordered a regular coffee and the “Jess iced coffee,” and both were undrinkable. The coffee tasted like dirty water, and the iced coffee? Somehow worse. I couldn’t even get through a single bite or sip without feeling nauseated. If their stuff was really as amazing as they claim, they’d be drinking that coffee every day — but something tells me even they wouldn’t. It was hands down the worst bakery experience I’ve ever had.

Look, I usually hate bashing businesses, especially family-owned ones, because I understand it’s not easy. But when these sisters are publicly dragging other businesses on their platform, I feel like I have every right to be brutally honest about theirs. And let me tell you, what really set me off was when Jess went all the way to FRANCE — the actual birthplace of croissants and macarons — and still had the audacity to say, “Nothing compares to Manan Bakery.” Are you kidding me? They’ve got to be out of their minds if they believe that.

I moved to another country 6 years ago for my then husband. After 4 years of living here my mom decided to move here aswell. Me and her are like best friends and have always been very close. She lived next to me and my then husband. 

A year ago I divorced, and this made my mom and me even closer. Since we're both in a foreign country. 

I met an amazing guy 3 months ago and me and him have been perfect. I find it hard to devide my time though between my mom, our work and my new boyfriend. 

I am 27 and I want to take this relationship as serious as he, my new boyfriend does. My mom and I bought property here and are renovating it by ourselves, so technically im already spending the whole day with my mom as we want to have it finished before were going to rent it out. 

Last week my boyfriend asked me to have lunch so I told my mom 'tomorrow he'll pick me up from the house and i'll have lunch with him outside'. She told me it felt strange to her that I didnt ask her to tag along since me and her are both working at the house. I told her I want to spend some quality time with him and that me and her are together everyday. She kept by her opinion and I kept by mine. It does bother me though that she feels that way. I feel like I am here deviding my time between two people and I am sucked dry. 

I see my boyfriend almost everyday and sometimes we take a coffee outside with my mom as well. Him and I make fun trips every sunday and although my mom tells me to enjoy it I can feel that she is jealous or wants to be included. Though I have only been with him for 3 months and every thing is new for us so obviously we want to spend time together without anyone else. 

My main question is, should I feel this inmense guilt that I am feeling? I know she moved here because she wanted to be closer to me and she loves it here, but I cant be with her 24/7 and I should'nt be. But alone she won't really go out. I see her everyday, even when the house will be done so its not like I dont spend time with her.

# Millions of Lives Transformed

The real measure of any weight loss supplement is its impact on the lives of its users, and in this regard, BioVanish has excelled. It has helped millions on their journey to weight loss and well-being. Testimonials and success stories continue to pour in, underscoring its game-changing status.

# Harnessing the Power of the Dairy Farm Method

BioVanish’s unique approach, known as the “Dairy Farm Method,” is a breakthrough in effective weight loss. By focusing on maintaining optimal Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, BioVanish has revolutionized weight loss. BHB is crucial for successful weight loss, as it signals the body to switch from using glucose to burning fat.

# Understanding BHB Levels

Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a natural ketone produced during fasting, low carbohydrate intake, or strenuous exercise. It signals the body to switch to fat-burning mode, a key process in successful weight loss. Typically, achieving and maintaining a state of ketosis is a challenge, but BioVanish makes this process more attainable.

# [Visit Official Website To Order BIOVANISH Click Here](https://tinyurl.com/3hdaefy7)

# The Dairy Farm Method — A Unique Strategy

Inspired by dairy farming practices, the “Dairy Farm Method” provides the body with essential nutrients to stimulate BHB production. This innovative approach supplies the body with the elements needed to promote and sustain ketosis, resulting in effortless weight loss.

# Manufacturing a Unique Formula

BioVanish’s formula encourages the body to enter ketosis more easily. Ketosis is a metabolic state where the body primarily burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. In this state, fat stores are rapidly broken down for energy, leading to weight loss. Users report feeling more energetic and satisfied throughout the day, thanks to the natural fat-burning process occurring in their bodies.

# Effortless Weight Loss and Lasting Results

The Dairy Farm Method employed by BioVanish makes weight loss feel more effortless. It aligns with the body’s natural processes, providing the tools to optimize fat-burning capabilities. The result is a transformational weight loss journey that feels gentle and steady, rather than grueling.

# The Ingredients That Make BioVanish Shine

Understanding the core ingredients of BioVanish is essential to appreciate how this supplement works to transform the weight loss journey. Let’s take a closer look at the key ingredients and how they contribute to the overall effectiveness of this unique formula:

# [Visit Official Website To Order BIOVANISH Click Here](https://tinyurl.com/3hdaefy7)

1. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
2. Vitamin B6 is a vital nutrient that plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. While it’s not a direct fat-burning ingredient, it is important for a smooth-running metabolism. A well-functioning metabolism is essential for efficient weight loss, as it helps the body break down food and convert it into energy. Vitamin B6 helps regulate the metabolic processes that contribute to the breakdown of fats and carbohydrates.
3. Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin)
4. Vitamin B12 is another member of the B-vitamin family, and it plays a key role in maintaining nerve function, DNA synthesis, and overall cellular energy production. Without enough B12, fatigue and weakness can set in, which can hinder physical activity and, by extension, weight loss efforts. By ensuring an adequate supply of B12, BioVanish helps users stay active and energized throughout the day, making it easier to stick to a weight loss plan.
5. Folate (L-Methylfolate)
6. Folate, or vitamin B9, is crucial for numerous bodily functions. It is particularly important for its role in supporting healthy cell division and promoting a well-functioning cardiovascular system. In the context of weight loss, maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system is essential. An efficient circulatory system ensures that oxygen and nutrients are delivered to cells effectively, supporting energy production and overall well-being.
7. Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCT)
8. MCTs are a type of fat that is more rapidly absorbed and utilized by the body compared to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). They are known to promote feelings of fullness, which can be particularly beneficial for those trying to control their caloric intake and lose weight. MCTs are also used by the body for quick energy production, and they can be a valuable source of fuel for individuals following a low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet.
9. L-Theanine
10. L-Theanine is an amino acid most commonly found in tea leaves. It is known for its calming and relaxing effects. While it might seem odd to include a calming ingredient in a weight loss supplement, it has its purpose. Weight loss can be a stressful journey, and many people turn to food for comfort when facing stress or emotional challenges. L-Theanine may help reduce stress and emotional eating, making it easier to stick to a diet and maintain a caloric deficit.

# BioVanish Pricing and Refund Policy

However, BioVanish offers package deals for those looking to invest in a more extended weight loss journey:

# Harnessing the Power of the Dairy Farm Method

BioVanish’s unique approach, known as the “Dairy Farm Method,” is a breakthrough in effective weight loss. By focusing on maintaining optimal Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels, BioVanish has revolutionized weight loss. BHB is crucial for successful weight loss, as it signals the body to switch from using glucose to burning fat.

# Understanding BHB Levels

Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) is a natural ketone produced during fasting, low carbohydrate intake, or strenuous exercise. It signals the body to switch to fat-burning mode, a key process in successful weight loss. Typically, achieving and maintaining a state of ketosis is a challenge, but BioVanish makes this process more attainable.

# [Visit Official Website To Order BIOVANISH Click Here](https://tinyurl.com/3hdaefy7)

# The Dairy Farm Method — A Unique Strategy

Inspired by dairy farming practices, the “Dairy Farm Method” provides the body with essential nutrients to stimulate BHB production. This innovative approach supplies the body with the elements needed to promote and sustain ketosis, resulting in effortless weight loss.

# Manufacturing a Unique Formula

BioVanish’s formula encourages the body to enter ketosis more easily. Ketosis is a metabolic state where the body primarily burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates. In this state, fat stores are rapidly broken down for energy, leading to weight loss. Users report feeling more energetic and satisfied throughout the day, thanks to the natural fat-burning process occurring in their bodies.

# Effortless Weight Loss and Lasting Results

The Dairy Farm Method employed by BioVanish makes weight loss feel more effortless. It aligns with the body’s natural processes, providing the tools to optimize fat-burning capabilities. The result is a transformational weight loss journey that feels gentle and steady, rather than grueling.

# The Ingredients That Make BioVanish Shine

Understanding the core ingredients of BioVanish is essential to appreciate how this supplement works to transform the weight loss journey. Let’s take a closer look at the key ingredients and how they contribute to the overall effectiveness of this unique formula:

# [Visit Official Website To Order BIOVANISH Click Here](https://tinyurl.com/3hdaefy7)

1. Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine Hydrochloride)
2. Vitamin B6 is a vital nutrient that plays a crucial role in maintaining overall health and well-being. While it’s not a direct fat-burning ingredient, it is important for a smooth-running metabolism. A well-functioning metabolism is essential for efficient weight loss, as it helps the body break down food and convert it into energy. Vitamin B6 helps regulate the metabolic processes that contribute to the breakdown of fats and carbohydrates.
3. Vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin)
4. Vitamin B12 is another member of the B-vitamin family, and it plays a key role in maintaining nerve function, DNA synthesis, and overall cellular energy production. Without enough B12, fatigue and weakness can set in, which can hinder physical activity and, by extension, weight loss efforts. By ensuring an adequate supply of B12, BioVanish helps users stay active and energized throughout the day, making it easier to stick to a weight loss plan.
5. Folate (L-Methylfolate)
6. Folate, or vitamin B9, is crucial for numerous bodily functions. It is particularly important for its role in supporting healthy cell division and promoting a well-functioning cardiovascular system. In the context of weight loss, maintaining a healthy cardiovascular system is essential. An efficient circulatory system ensures that oxygen and nutrients are delivered to cells effectively, supporting energy production and overall well-being.
7. Medium-Chain Triglycerides (MCT)
8. MCTs are a type of fat that is more rapidly absorbed and utilized by the body compared to long-chain triglycerides (LCTs). They are known to promote feelings of fullness, which can be particularly beneficial for those trying to control their caloric intake and lose weight. MCTs are also used by the body for quick energy production, and they can be a valuable source of fuel for individuals following a low-carbohydrate or ketogenic diet.
9. L-Theanine
10. L-Theanine is an amino acid most commonly found in tea leaves. It is known for its calming and relaxing effects. While it might seem odd to include a calming ingredient in a weight loss supplement, it has its purpose. Weight loss can be a stressful journey, and many people turn to food for comfort when facing stress or emotional challenges. L-Theanine may help reduce stress and emotional eating, making it easier to stick to a diet and maintain a caloric deficit.

1g2x3c6,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1g2x3c6/should_i_have_coffee_with_my_ex_fiancé/,should I have coffee with my ex fiancé? ,"Three weeks ago my fiancé ( M 30) broke up with me (F 29) unexpectedly. Lets start from the beginning we were together for 3 years

There have been various things that happened over the 3 years we have been together, our first month of being together I found a message on Facebook where he asked another girl for his number, when he saw he got really mad and threw his phone against the wall in anger.

He did however apologize and said its nothing serious and that she is only a friend. A few months passed and one night a friend asked if they could have a boys night they went out and I told him that he should enjoy his night, the next day he came to visit me and we were looking at something on Facebook together , I has a funny feeling and went through his messages ( which I should not have done) and I saw a message from another girl asking ""hey will you still be picking me up ?"" when he came back from the bathroom he saw the look on my face and knew what I saw, his explanation was him and his friend were talking about friends from school and her name came up ( the girl who sent the message) he said his friend asked if they could search her on Facebook and talk to her , my fiancé said he was not the one talking to her over Facebook but his friend ( I was skeptical and still am) he also apologized and said he wanted to tell me what happened, they did not pick her up. After a while deactivated his Facebook saying he does not want to hurt me.

On a Wednesday night was my aunts wedding and he could only come to the reception as he was working. I had to leave early as I was house sitting my aunts house I thought he would go with me but he wanted to stay later , I told him just to be safe and he told me he loves me and he won't disappoint me by getting drunk and driving drunk ( which he has done before and got into an accident and caused him to be in a coma for 3 hours). At 12 the evening I received a message from him saying "" I am home save"" at 4am in the morning I got a phone call from his mother asking where he is as he did not go home ( some context his house got robbed and they stole everything hence why he had to move back to his parents)

I told her he said he is safe home, I tried phoning him and he then told me that he slept over by a friend close to the wedding venue, I was hurt as he lied to me where he was and we got into an argument and I asked him if he was truthful about where he was , he was mad and told me he does not understand why he would ask that. He also said he can't live up to my standards and I need to decide what I want.

We did not make up but Friday night he asked me if I still wanted to go with him to a festival we planned on going to with his parents I said yes and he said we are leaving at 6am on Saturday morning. I woke up early to get ready and by 6am no one showed up , I then tried phoning him and he did not pick up eventually he sent me a message saying he is no longer going as he is tired,

I was upset as I already got ready and he did not bother telling me, I told him he could have told me and I got no reply, I phoned his mom as I left something in their car and wanted to ask if they would be okay dropping it off before they go to the festival, When I phoned her she told me she does not know if they are going as her son is not home yet and he told her he was with me ( which he was not) I was so angry and hurt and tried phoning him he did not answer eventually I left him a voice message saying I am hurt and that we need to talk and that he is pushing me away by the things he is doing and it's going to take more time for me to forgive him.

He then later the day sent a WhatsApp message saying we should go our separate ways . He did not even try to come and meet in person to talk it out,

I tried phoning him after the breakup and he said to not call him as he does not want to hear me cry. He also sent an voice note saying he just knew he could not make me happy and give me what I wanted and the happiness I was looking for and that he does not see a future with me in it. We already started paying our wedding venue and the wedding planning was in full swing.

After everything he did not apologize once for being dishonest

2 weeks later he said he wants to stay in contact and maybe we could go for coffee and talk about everything.

I am hesitant and not sure what to do, I don't want to go but somehow I still love him and want to hear him out but on the other hand I feel like it will hurt me more if I go than anything else.",1,1728846225.0,NoStupidQuestions,10,1.0,False
1g2x333,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1g2x333/90_days_a_few_thoughts/,90 Days - A few thoughts...,"I hit 90 days earlier this week. Didn't even realise at the time so that's a good indicator of how things are going.

I'm 32 and spent 14 years of my life gambling online. Football, horses and slots ruled my life. Not a single day went by without a bet and what once started as £10 at a weekend became £100-£200 A DAY. The first thing I'd do in the morning would be deposit money and sometimes it'd be gone before I had even had my morning coffee... so I'd chuck another £100+ in and gamble all day at work. I kept this a secret from my wife, family and friends for over a decade.

In July, I had -£2500 in overdrafts, -£1500 on a credit card and an £8,000 personal loan.

My life changed on July 10th. I'd tried to quit so many times on my own but always kept the door open, convincing myself I'd quit and then 'gamble responsibly' when I had a handle on things.

Never worked. I had lost a bet on Australian Under 20 football (I know, right...) so before I could stop myself I deleted all my gambling accounts, signed up to GamStop, put blocks on my bank cards and the hardest thing of all, I admitted my problem to my wife and gave her full access to my bank accounts. I wouldn't have blamed her for walking away - we had been married less than a year and she thought we were close to buying a house after I dodged and ducked all financial questions for years because (shamefully), she trusted me implicitly and had no reason to doubt I was telling her the truth...

Lots of tears and anger followed but she's a wonderful woman and she held me as I cried and told me we'd get through it together. We have and continue to do so. We check in more regularly and she can see every penny I spend. I'm acccountable for the rest of my days and I need to be.

I told my family a few days later and a close friend and I've not thought about gambling since that day. No urges, no temptation, nothing. The truth really does set you free. I can sleep at night now, I've stop clenching my jaw and having heart palpitations. I can talk about the future and mean it now. I can buy things I actually need instead of seeing everything ad gambling tokens!

I attend GA - initially 2 meetings a week and it's been somewhat helpful (one group more than the other). It's good to speak to people that have been in my position, if nothing else.

My biggest mental block was knowing how long it would take to clear my debts but a guy at GA said to me 'if you stop gambling at least they won't get any bigger' and that really stuck with me. 3 months on and I've halved my credit card debt and am so close to being overdraft free.

Everyone's journey is different but if you want to quit and really mean it - then tell someone. Anyone. Honesty with yourself and others is the only way out of this. If you have no one, my inbox is open. 

You know the craziest thing, I was spending hundreds to thousands a month to win a jackpot... but I don't actually have anything to spend my money on. Maybe a coffee or a beer when I'm out a few times a month. Crazy.",3,1728846209.0,problemgambling,1,1.0,False

I haven’t really noticed any impact so far, and no real side effects. 

I went onto 50mg Tuesday, not noticed anything initially, then the last couple days during the afternoon I get this numbing in my head. The only thing I can relate it to is brain fog from bloating and stomach issues. Now what’s causing me confusion is I have long term stomach issues, which causes a lot of symptoms and massively spikes my anxiety so I am struggling to tell if the Elvanse is doing anything. 

I am 39 years old and only 3 months ago been diagnosed with ADHD subtype combined, autism and OCD. I have had periods in my life where I have experienced anxiety or lows, but in February this year everything changed and since then I have not felt myself, on edge and struggling. I didn’t expect Elvanse to magically cure me, but was hoping it would start to help me as I feel with the ADHD, OCD and autism and stomach issues I do not know what’s impacting me at times. I sometimes feel like I am losing myself, my psychologist assures me I am not losing my mind and on good days I feel like I am going to be ok. Then I have an inexplicable blip at any moment and I feel a sudden crushing overwhelming fear. I have 2 young kids and feel incredible guilt I am not the father I want to be to them, also I feel guilty as since having kids my traits and symptoms have spiked massively. I have heard this is common as kids obviously impact life’s so much, but I hate what it’s doing to me as a person. I have always had a worrying side and anxiety, but now I struggle to enjoy anything. It’s like since being diagnosed it’s actually made me worse through an awareness of everything whereas before I was just unaware and naive. Apologies for the long post, just kinda got so much in my head and I am trying so much to get better - no coffee, no alcohol (2 years), meditation 3 times a day, breath work 3 times a day, affirmations, stretches, cold showers, protein and healthy diet, exercise, seeing a psychologist, journaling etc. I could do better with sleep, but I am doing all this, have meds and yet I feeling like I am just about coping. Whereas previously in my life with some massive trauma it would hit me but I could bounce back so quickly, now I feel fragile. ",1,1728846132.0,ADHDUK,2,1.0,False

1g2wxym,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2wxym,Need help for my living room,"Hi all!

I’m looking for some new furniture in my living room, and I’m kind of struggling to figure out what works best.

I’m trying to go a bit into the Scandinavian / minimal / Japandi style.

I will keep my couch (visible in the pics) and the floor will also stay the same (also visible in the pics as background and in the last pic).

I’m kinda struggling with what kind of wood tones to go with. I could go for darker wood tones to match the couch, but this might be a bit ‘heavy’. On the other hand, I could go with lighter wood (oak) tones, but this way, the couch probably pops out too much, and oak pieces then perhaps kinda fade away on the oak-looking floor. Or, I could go for a mix of light and darker pieces? But I’m not sure if this will look messy, since it wouldn’t ‘match’ in wood colors?

I’ve made a couple pics as visualization. On pic 1, 2 and 3 the background is my current floor, and the couch on the left is my current couch. I’ve Photoshopped some beige pillows on it, since my decoration will be mostly in that tone.

The furniture I added on the images isn’t necessarily the exact furniture I would get, but it is the style I’m going for, so it’s more as a reference to visualize it.

Pic 1 - Dark furniture
Pic 2 - Light furniture
Pic 3 - Mixed
Pic 4 - Impression of the room (note the bottom part of the floor for color reference > I’ve Photoshopped my current coffee table off of it, which caused discoloration of the image on the part above that)

It’s complicated ,"My crush confessed his feelings a month back. Told me in a post drink setting that he wanted to kiss me. Nothing happened because he told me this on text when we were back home. 

It’s a complicated situation and we can’t pursue this relationship long term. It’s someone from work. The next day we discussed there’s nothing to discuss or pursue and it was just a moment on stupidity where he said what he said. 

But when he told me about his feelings, my own feelings grew super intense. I went down a spiral. The last month has been a whirlwind. I tried to completely ice him out, be rude to him (so that the crush goes away), stopped talking but nothing worked, things just got complicated and I kept feeling a pull towards him. Eventually I got sick (with a legit flu) and we didn’t see each other for 2 weeks. Even during this time whenever I felt better I kept on fighting with him over menial reasons. 

Anyway when I got better and we saw each other he was sweet to me, told me we should not fight, tried to apologise, took me out to coffee etc. since that day our equation has improved a lot (compared to the last month) and we are back to being normal and nice to each other, constantly talking to each other, sending reels on IG etc. 

I can tell he’s interested in me but I’m Not sure what changed for him when I joined work back. 

2-3 days back he proposed dinner + drinks post work and I said yes.  


I’m a little confused about what to expect on this dinner? I want to make it as low key and not awkward as possible. 

Any advice on what’s going on in his head? And what should I do?

As the title suggests, I’m a current serving member who is struggling with feeling inadequate and not good enough. I’m a member of the Canadian Armed Forces so if this isn’t allowed please delete. 

For context: I used to be an infantry soldier but got injured when I was young during basic (21 years old). I got through my infantry training up until the final portion when my back injury flared up  and was sent home. I decided to release at 23 to focus on recovery and eventually re enlisted as the Canadian equivalent of an 88M in Motor Transport. I fell in love with the trade and served in a field unit for 2 years. I felt like I found my calling and loved driving the military trucks, running convoys, and especially when I learned how to drive the forward area refueller. 

I made it my goal to deploy overseas as I wanted to do my part on at least one mission. I ended up getting on a posting in Canada as a VIP driver and enjoyed it, but after a year and a half of not driving the army trucks or going to the field I began to miss it. I had been trying to go on deployment for around 4 years and was finally selected to go. I was originally going to be sent to a field unit to drive the same vehicles I trained on and I was beyond excited to go. Only to be taken off last minute and placed in another VIP driving position but overseas. 

I’m going home in three weeks and I’ll be honest - I’ve been starting to really struggle with my experience here. I haven’t touched a military truck in roughly 2.5 years now and I quite simply feel like I haven’t done my part. Or any part. I did not get to do any field work, drive any military vehicles, only driving my VIP from their residence to work and back, with some administrative work on the side where I work. I ended up making it a thing to go to the motor pool on Fridays with my coffee and watch everyone do their thing and see all the vehicles on the mission.

Recently when I was by myself last Friday I broke down in the staff car because I just felt like I didn’t contribute anything to this mission. Now that I’m going home and I’m starting to reflect on what I did I feel like I did nothing compared to other troops deployed here. 

This is something that has been building up and it finally came to a head last Friday. I just miss working with my brothers and sisters when I was in the field unit, and driving the large military pattern vehicles together.

I’m just really wondering if anyone has felt this way at all and if anyone had any advice on how to shake this feeling. Don’t get me wrong, I’m proud of being here as part of the bigger picture and the mission, but as far as what I’ve done here specifically I feel like it’s not important whatsoever and haven’t contributed to anything. In my heart I’m a soldier and I’m proud to serve I just genuinely feel heartbroken that I got pulled away from driving the refueller with the field element and put on this tasking instead. The only feeling I can relate it to is in Jarhead when they trained to be snipers for years only to never get to do what they trained for. ",1,1728845618.0,Veterans,1,1.0,False

The way we way made it seem like the love we shared was wasted time. Maybe we'll meet again after time has enough time has passed and we can catch up over a cup of coffee. And afterwards, we will give each other a hug and leave it at that. But right now I am chaos to your thoughts and you are poison to my heart. The saddest part about us is that every single time I tried to explaining to you how I felt or what I was overthinking, you just thought I was trying to start and argument but all I wanted was for you to understand what I was feeling. I can call you names now. List 100 reasons why you were awful. But what would that do? Where would it leave me? 

I still loved you. I have still have to live with that. Sometimes it seems that the harder you try to hold on to something or someone, the more it wants to get away. You feel like some kind of criminal for having felt. For having wanted. For having wanted to be wanted. What else could you have wanted from me? I offered you my heart, my soul and my body. I allowed you build a home within me, but you still went out and bought a lighter. Just to ignite me.

There have been various things that happened over the 3 years we have been together, our first month of being together I found a message on Facebook where he asked another girl for his number, when he saw he got really mad and threw his phone against the wall in anger.

He did however apologize and said its nothing serious and that she is only a friend. A few months passed and one night a friend asked if they could have a boys night they went out and I told him that he should enjoy his night, the next day he came to visit me and we were looking at something on Facebook together , I has a funny feeling and went through his messages ( which I should not have done) and I saw a message from another girl asking ""hey will you still be picking me up ?"" when he came back from the bathroom he saw the look on my face and knew what I saw, his explanation was him and his friend were talking about friends from school and her name came up ( the girl who sent the message) he said his friend asked if they could search her on Facebook and talk to her , my fiancé said he was not the one talking to her over Facebook but his friend ( I was skeptical and still am) he also apologized and said he wanted to tell me what happened, they did not pick her up. After a while deactivated his Facebook saying he does not want to hurt me.

On a Wednesday night was my aunts wedding and he could only come to the reception as he was working. I had to leave early as I was house sitting my aunts house I thought he would go with me but he wanted to stay later , I told him just to be safe and he told me he loves me and he won't disappoint me by getting drunk and driving drunk ( which he has done before and got into an accident and caused him to be in a coma for 3 hours). At 12 the evening I received a message from him saying "" I am home save"" at 4am in the morning I got a phone call from his mother asking where he is as he did not go home ( some context his house got robbed and they stole everything hence why he had to move back to his parents)

I told her he said he is safe home, I tried phoning him and he then told me that he slept over by a friend close to the wedding venue, I was hurt as he lied to me where he was and we got into an argument and I asked him if he was truthful about where he was , he was mad and told me he does not understand why he would ask that. He also said he can't live up to my standards and I need to decide what I want.

We did not make up but Friday night he asked me if I still wanted to go with him to a festival we planned on going to with his parents I said yes and he said we are leaving at 6am on Saturday morning. I woke up early to get ready and by 6am no one showed up , I then tried phoning him and he did not pick up eventually he sent me a message saying he is no longer going as he is tired,

I was upset as I already got ready and he did not bother telling me, I told him he could have told me and I got no reply, I phoned his mom as I left something in their car and wanted to ask if they would be okay dropping it off before they go to the festival, When I phoned her she told me she does not know if they are going as her son is not home yet and he told her he was with me ( which he was not) I was so angry and hurt and tried phoning him he did not answer eventually I left him a voice message saying I am hurt and that we need to talk and that he is pushing me away by the things he is doing and it's going to take more time for me to forgive him.

He then later the day sent a WhatsApp message saying we should go our separate ways . He did not even try to come and meet in person to talk it out,

I tried phoning him after the breakup and he said to not call him as he does not want to hear me cry. He also sent an voice note saying he just knew he could not make me happy and give me what I wanted and the happiness I was looking for and that he does not see a future with me in it. We already started paying our wedding venue and the wedding planning was in full swing.

After everything he did not apologize once for being dishonest

2 weeks later he said he wants to stay in contact and maybe we could go for coffee and talk about everything.

I am hesitant and not sure what to do, I don't want to go but somehow I still love him and want to hear him out but on the other hand I feel like it will hurt me more if I go than anything else.",1,1728845550.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

In our town, we have two McDonalds: one in the Walmart and one as a stand alone restaurant.  I bought my groceries at Walmart and looked into the McDonald's to see how busy it was.  There was a boomer waiting to pick up his order, so I quickly headed to my car to drop my groceries off and went back inside to the McDonalds.  
  
The boomer was still waiting with just his coffee in hand, so I placed my order of just a Big Mac.  The boomer tells me he's been waiting ""10 minutes"" for his order and how it's the third time this has happened in the past couple of weeks.  This McDonalds can be slow as there are only 2 people working at it, so you can't be in a rush.  I told him there's another McDonalds in town with more staff, and he just sort of grunted.  They call out my order a few minutes later and he goes to take my order, but the cashier says ""your order will take 7 more minutes to cook.""

I don't know anything that takes 17 minutes to order at McDonalds unless it's for a large family on a busy day. My guess he probably wanted freshly cooked fries, expected them to be done in a few minutes and was exaggerating the time he was waiting, or maybe he pissed the cashier off when he ordered and they were going deliberately slow?    

Anyways as I was driving away, I saw the boomer walk out with only his coffee in his hand, so I assume he got fed up and left. ",6,1728845501.0,BoomersBeingFools,4,1.0,False

We recently had someone who already works in our building (21f) pick up shifts in my department, we have a closed office out of view from the rest of the facility, with this coworker joining our team, we’ll call her Claire. Claire has become friends with my other coworker(22-24F not sure) who works in my department, we’ll call this one…Rita. Claire and Rita have recently become very close, having sleepovers and such outside of work, since Claire has picked up and become part of our department, Rita has changed. Both exhibiting classic mean girl high school behavior. This has gone as far as Rita taking videos of me without my consent and behind my back, sending them to my boss and Claire. I am not doing anything wrong in these videos, simply taking small short breaks from doing paperwork that the job requires as it’s a lot sometimes. How do I know about the videos? My boss tells me. My boss and I were friends outside of work and she actually used to babysit me when I was younger. Her and my mom worked together. But we keep our work lives very professional. Today marks the second mentioning of these videos being taken of me and both times I have mentioned to my boss how uncomfortable and anxious this makes me. As I don’t really even take pictures of myself and don’t like being photographed willingly, so to have it done without my knowledge makes me extremely anxious and uncomfortable. This being said I have told my boss about this, she could not give a shit less because she doesn’t want conflict in the work space. But she is in agreement that Rita and Claire have both had faltering work ethics and have been doing things that our administration level bosses wouldn’t even approve of, such as sitting on the floor at the front desk and eating where visiting family members and staff can see them, instead of doing their work. I have had my faults as well with this job but my boss and I have had sit down talks where I explained what has caused these faults and how I can improve. She’s a lenient and very understanding boss with all of us. Time off is never denied, we’re allowed to be late. We can order food and eat in the office, out of family sight. Etc. But even she’s starting to lose patience with these two but won’t do anything, besides the videos being taken of me against my consent the two of them have lied to my boss to try and frame me in a bad light. This I don’t understand, I’ve been nothing but kind to either of them and have even gone out of my way to pick up coffee or lunch for all of us on my way in or on my lunch break more often than not. Rita and I used to have a very healthy relationship in the workplace prior to Claire coming into our department. We would trade off who bought snacks and drinks for our shifts every Sunday. One Sunday me, one Sunday her. Now Rita is calling in on the only days she works with me with bullshit excuses, taking videos of me behind my back and treating me poorly. My boss doesn’t want to do anything and doesn’t want me to say anything. But I feel now it’s time to intervene as I’m now incredibly uncomfortable and anxious in my workplace but I love my job and don’t want to leave. This job is the most fulfilling job I’ve ever had and I love coming into work. My one year is actually next week. Am I overreacting or overthinking this? Should I say something? 

TLDR: My coworker has suddenly changed in behavior and is now taking unconsenual videos of me in the workplace and calling off on days she works with me, making up things, and has become rude. We had a fantastic relationship just weeks prior and from mine and my bosses perspective nothing has changed nor have I done anything.",2,1728845230.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

What I would want it for - quick and easy shots of espresso, one cup of strong coffee some mornings when I’m in a rush (usually I do pour overs, but I don’t always have time.) 

In the winter I might mix my nespresso with milk/hot chocolate mix or ghiradelli syrup to make a latte, but I don’t need all the bells and whistles and more parts to clean if buying a model with all of those will jack up the price.

WHAT’S ON

😱 Margam Park Fright Nights

When I was growing up, Halloween used to mean wearing a flimsy mask in the vague shape of a generic monster and apple bobbing in other people’s saliva for one night on October 31st. But, here we are in 2024 with large-scale spooky events starting nearly two weeks earlier.

If (unlike me… yet) you’re already in the Halloween spirit, the Fright Nights event in Margam, a short drive from Swansea, should be right up your Nightmare-on-Elm-Street. Sorry.

Daily from October 18th to November 3rd, the spooky trail runs outside, then into the castle - complete with a cast of live actors, street food and drinks, plus fairground rides. There are two experiences on offer:

Family Fun: For those wanting to enjoy some light-hearted Halloween fun, with jumps and giggles galore. Suitable for over 5s.

Sun - Fri: Adult £25 | Child £15 | Family £65 | Sat: Adult £25 | Child £15 | Family £65

Extreme Horror: Strictly for 15-year-olds and over and those who crave spine-chilling terror. Professional scare actors will not break character in an experience designed to terrify.

Sun - Fri: £20 | Sat: £25

🍎 Gower Apple & Cider Festival

The apple tree in our garden supplied us with a bounty of, count ‘em, three apples this year! But, given how terrible a gardener I am, I’m calling that a win. Presumably, the Gower Heritage Centre has been a lot more successful in its growing, since the annual Gower Cider Festival returns there all this coming weekend (Friday October 18th - Sunday October 20th), where you can experience a wide variety of locally produced, award-winning Welsh cheese, cider, and perry. Plus, watch as apples are harvested, and squeezed on a traditional 1800s travelling press - all this backed by a full day of live music and entertainment.

6 PM until late on Friday; 10 AM until late on Saturday, and 10 AM until 5 PM on Sunday | £8 - £26 (Day, night and weekend tickets all available).

1g2wkt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalDevices/comments/1g2wkt5/my_experience_breaking_into_med_device_as_a/,My experience breaking into med device as a personal trainer at 26 ,"Lots of posts here talking about getting 0 bites so here’s what I did

26 year old masters grad - sports science & human performance 

5 years personal training exp with 1 year of retail

Here’s not what to do: 
- apply for jobs thinking you’re going to get a bite. Big companies AI filter applications and you’re not going to make the stack unless you’re a STEM major or have experience
-

what I did: 
- I asked everyone I knew if they knew someone in med device 
- I would get their contact info and ask to buy them coffee or breakfast if local, or ask for a phone call 
- I found open positions, and reached out to the appropriate regional manager on Linkedin 


After hundreds of apps and nearly a hundred calls and coffees a position opened up as a spine associate 

What I did in the interview
- let them know i was willing to work and I was committed long term
- explained how my science based background and my hard work ethic would contribute and allow me to make a great impact
- I followed up after every interview and phone call asking the timelines for the next step, I maintained communication without being annoying and pestering

It wasn't the best experience and I haven't wanted to date for 4 years now. Takes me a while to crush on someone, but I saw someone cute at my coffee shop, liked his style and instant crush. I seem to run into him alot in my neighborhood, farmers market, park, store. We notice each other so this one day I smiled , but he didn't smile back, just pulled a really stoic face so I never did anything about it. I'm easily discouraged so one weird vibe and I'm out. I actually switched coffee shops so I wouldn't see him as much, but then he started going there too. That gave me a little hope until today. He was sitting  inside the tiny coffee shop with a full coffee when I walked in and the second he saw me, he got up and left. I took it personal. Like, it made me want to cry in the middle of the coffee shop. I don't know why he had such a visceral reaction to someone who has never approached him or bothered him at all. I guess the mere sight of me is a bother to him. I did all the mental gymnastics in my head like, he didn't even notice you, people have their own issues, it's not all about you, etc. But it was pretty blatant and obvious. I'm not always 100% about things but my instincts and observation skills are very good and I don't think I'm reading this situation wrong. It was a big blow to my self esteem and I just feel like a hideous freak who should just content herself with being alone. I don't know... I'm just sad. ",1,1728844841.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

So the couch is a bit off to the side from the fireplace. We currently have one chair but are looking to either add one more chair or take this one out and replace it with two chairs. We’re struggling to figure out where to place the chairs and a coffee table in relation to the couch and the fireplace. 

We also have the tv on the one wall so that limits where we can put the chairs. Any suggestions for a rug placement/size would be much appreciated as well because I feel like the size of it right now doesn’t really work with the space. Thanks in advance! ",1,1728844833.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False
1g2wjk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1g2wjk7/my_store_had_an_electrical_fire/,My store had an electrical fire,"Yesterday my stores dishwasher had an electical fire around 8:15 AM during my 7:30 to 2:30 shift. My co-worker ran out from the back telling everybody to evacuate because there was a fire and everyone awkwardly just stared at her. I had two customers who were sitting in smoke not wanting to leave until I put there for-here orders and in a to-go cup. I had another guy who also didn't want to leave until I grabbed his Venti Pike with cream and sugar. I was so angry, I think people are so dumb. You're literally sitting here in clouds of smoke worried about your fucking cup of coffee?! I know it's expensive but your life is more important PLUS you can have your refund later, just get out of the effing store. I was sick of peoples shit and wanted to get out as soon as possible because I have severe asthma, so I handed one customer two grande hot cups (no lids) and the other guy his sugars, poured his Venti Pike, he told me to give him light cream but I didn't care so I just gave him a lot of cream, and I told him to get out. While I was doing that, one of my coworkers ran in the back where the fire was and grabbed everybody's stuff 😭💀😂 when we got outside of the store I was like OMG we forgot to check the bathrooms, I ran back inside to open both bathrooms, thankfully nobody was there. I ran back outside and met with my co-workers who locked the door, first thing someone says is, ""At least we finished ready-set-go""😂💀 Then these three girls who look like they were about 20s started walking up to the store, and one of my co-workers said ""we're closed, there's a fire,"" and one of the girls said ""Reallllllllllllly:(((( Are you sure you're closssssedddd:((((((((("" and sat there and pouted for a few minutes. I was standing there looking at them like.....😬

Me and my coworkers were just waiting outside, watching the fireman do their thing, our manager finally arrived in her pajamas, there was at least four fire trucks there, apparently they were looking for us but they just thought we were a random group of people, when they asked for the manager all four of us pointed at her and the fireman was shocked because he didn't think she was the manager💀 Then the property manager as well as a manager from another Starbucks store came and we all did a walk-through after we got the okay too. I couldn't be in there for long because I was already coughing, wheezing, and my nose and eyes were burning. I ended up getting checked out by paramedics and was given eye drops, i took my inhaler shortly before they got there so they told me to wait for a breathing treatment until my medication kicked in. After being outside for almost 2 hours while and after the fire happened, we all ended up leaving. I went home and rested.


There wasn't really any damage to the store thankfully, there was a little burn mark on the wall, a few of our containers got burned, and no dishwasher. We ended up opening again around 4:30 PM. I ended up going back to do a 4-9, the fireman left these 5 blue fans to air out the store making it almost 60 degrees. It was still a bit smokey and there was a smell of burnt plastic. After I took my lunch at 6:50 I realized I wasn't doing too well. I ended up having to go to the emergency room because I was suffering from an asthma attack and smoke inhalation. Thankfully no carbon monoxide poisoning 💀 I ended up getting out of the hospital this morning I'm doing okay. Thankfully I have today off, but I go back to work tomorrow:( I hope it smells better😂


(I used speech to text for this, so I'm sorry if there's a lot of things that don't make sense at all. It's not the most reliable thing sometimes but I really didn't feel like typing this.)",7,1728844820.0,starbucks,0,0.82,False

When i came back i had nightmares and she said i was jumpy whenever someone got near me or touched me suddenly. this took years to get over but it still happens. I won’t get into the full extent of it but i still struggle with what she did and said to this day, my mom said she didn’t know how to handle an autistic kid because i was not only the first boy but i was the first diagnosed autistic kid. A little bit later she said It’s not abuse if i deserved it and i told her I hated her, thats when I stopped talking to her.

Fast forward 3 years after the argument shes having her birthday party, I realized I had sensory issues because of the autism so i mostly wear soft sweatpants unless it’s an important event. My culinary class was supposed to be going on a field trip to a coffee shop and i was excited but i was forced to go to to my grandmothers state and miss it so i was pissed, because i still didnt want to talk to her by this point so i missed my event for no reason. I Had and an exam that my teacher gave me an extension for this so I used that as an excuse why I couldnt go because i couldn’t talk about not going if the reason was related to my grandmother without getting yelled at by my mom. 

My Grandmother begged my mom to convince me to go to fix our relationship and i was harrassed for a while. She even said she would leave me alone but I knew that was a lie since she did that before. When my mom separated an event so i wouldn’t have to be around her my grandmother went behind my back and told her that i actually didn’t mind being around her and to do it in one, My mom didn’t fact check with me and I was aggravated but just told my mom to ask me next time or give me a heads up, my grandmother tried to sit next to me but I moved across from her instead, she was so close that she was touching.

For those reasons i stayed in the hotel did the exam and watched TV. I legitamitly thought me not going would change anything, but it was the main topic of conversation from what my sister said, my aunt asked my mom why i wasnt there and my mom told her to ask me, so by text i asked her “do you want me to lie or tell the truth”, she said truth and I gently said how I didn't like my grandmother and since im finally old enough to voice my opinions i wanted to cut contact and not to say anything about my reasonings. my mother was right next her her and was mad I didnt lie but was mad i was telling the turth too. Mom didn't talk to me for a whole week.


Now my mom going over seas for work again and broke her promise to never let me stay home alone with her. so now I have to wake up with her every day. not even 2 weeks in of her complaining about every little thing i do because it’s not done her way, we got into an arguement so i let everything i felt out. i told her i still hated her and i thought she would have gotten the hint after me and the aunt that texted me told her that i wanted to go NC, not to mention I got grounded over THIER argument when it got started over the last cigarette. I said how i didnt show up to her birthday for a reason, And i told her not to expect me to invite her to my graduation like my sister. I was Minding my business the entire time keeping to myself but she kept finding reasons to talk to me. I normally keep to myself and help no questions asked as long as i can be alone again after. but i couldnt go in my room for 10 minutes to be alone. My mom forcibly put her number into my phone, not the worst thing In the worst but slightly annoying. Lasted when we talked she said how i wasn’t keeping to myself that I was just bottling it up and holding it in.


Another aunt confronted me calmy and said i was out of line and I told her i had enough of people not helping me for years and not a single person besides my sister who actually witnessed what I went through said “hey that’s messed up” without justification. My mom came back and was furious at me so my grandmother used those bit picks to complain about me like how I didnt clean throughout the week and only deep cleaned on weekends, my mom knows this. how i brought my laptop to watch a movie while making breakfast for my brothers She recorded me without my consent and showed my mom. I asked her if she wanted some when I was cooking but she said no. That i never ate her food or only eat bits of it, shes severely overweight and makes unhealthy food and ive been going on a diet since before she got here, the only veggies in there get drowned out by sauce but i do try it in front of her to show respect but she makes enough for 4 people when it’s just us, my sister isn’t here to make up the difference. i asked her about it multiple times and she implied she knew i was on a diet by making comments on my body/ prep meals for those curious i went from 300lbs -> 260lbs. she was mad that when she asked for a towel for my brother I threw it over the balcony to her when Me, My Mom, and my Sister has done this for years since i was 10 so it was instinctual, not out of hate. Lucky my mom did say that She understood where I came from because we live in houses that has a few floors whike while grandmother only as one floor so this never happens. That was the only time she defended me.  How that I wait for the grass to get too long before cutting it, Its my moms grass and she takes pride in it so anything thats related to it I run by her before I cut it or water it, it’s like a fun competition between her and my stepdad so I want to help her win. My mom told me that I should listen to my grandmother as if she was my mother. Every time my mom comes back my grandmother pulls her aside and says how awful I was when i was on my best behavior and my grades was A-B’s, my mom would eat it up.

My grandmother been sucking up to me so we can still have a relationship and when confronted a few months ago she said she did it to toughen me up when all it did was give me trauma and has yet to take accountability so I refuse to give her that pleasure, I was tricked into going into an intervention. sometimes she would offer to drive me to events like school football games or homecomings, I ALWAYS pay for my own ticket so she doesn’t have to and go to the events rarely, i go mostly to get better at talking and yelling for long periods of time because I had a very bad stutter and nobody could understand me because i mumbled. Most of my classmates talk to me when I get there because I’m one of the popular kids for some reason. “Now I can hold entire conversations. i appreciated her taking me and I do offer to repay her in some way but she declines because i try to be fair in some way. outside of that, for my mom i try to do more but for my grandmother its more of a ""Ill pay for your food""/""I owe you"" type of thing. 

after i blew up on her the first week she has left me alone most days and i told her i dont mind if she calls me for something as long as its not the second i go back in my room, i rather get all the tasks done in one sitting then do it back and fourth, she understood but still critisizes me for minor stuff i dont get immediately because I’m the mornings and night i don’t wear my glasses so i don’t notice stuff at first but if pointed out i can still see it, i do look around before i go into another room. I almost never have outbursts or yell because I don’t like the way my throat feels after, but shes one of the few people that can push my buttons.


TLDR Anyway, I don’t want to invite her to my graduation because she refuses to take accountability for when she put me through and constantly crosses my boundaries would i be an a-hole for sticking to what I said and continuing going NC and im still holding a grudge 7-8 years later

I Had and an exam that my teacher gave me an extension for this so I used that as an excuse why I couldnt go because i couldn’t talk about not going if the reason was related to my grandmother without getting yelled at by my mom. 

My Grandmother begged my mom to convince me to go to fix our relationship and i was harrassed for a while. She even said she would leave me alone but I knew that was a lie since she did that before. When my mom separated an event so i wouldn’t have to be around her my grandmother went behind my back and told her that i actually didn’t mind being around her and to do it in one, My mom didn’t fact check with me and I was aggravated but just told my mom to ask me next time or give me a heads up, my grandmother tried to sit next to me but I moved across from her instead, she was so close that she was touching.

For those reasons i stayed in the hotel did the exam and watched TV. I legitamitly thought me not going would change anything, but it was the main topic of conversation from what my sister said, my aunt asked my mom why i wasnt there and my mom told her to ask me, so by text i asked her “do you want me to lie or tell the truth”, she said truth and I gently said how I didn't like my grandmother and since im finally old enough to voice my opinions i wanted to cut contact and not to say anything about my reasonings. my mother was right next her her and was mad I didnt lie but was mad i was telling the turth too. Mom didn't talk to me for a whole week.


Now my mom going over seas for work again and broke her promise to never let me stay home alone with her. so now I have to wake up with her every day. not even 2 weeks in of her complaining about every little thing i do because it’s not done her way, we got into an arguement so i let everything i felt out. i told her i still hated her and i thought she would have gotten the hint after me and the aunt that texted me told her that i wanted to go NC, not to mention I got grounded over THIER argument when it got started over the last cigarette. I said how i didnt show up to her birthday for a reason, And i told her not to expect me to invite her to my graduation like my sister. I was Minding my business the entire time keeping to myself but she kept finding reasons to talk to me. I normally keep to myself and help no questions asked as long as i can be alone again after. but i couldnt go in my room for 10 minutes to be alone. My mom forcibly put her number into my phone, not the worst thing In the worst but slightly annoying. Lasted when we talked she said how i wasn’t keeping to myself that I was just bottling it up and holding it in.


Another aunt confronted me calmy and said i was out of line and I told her i had enough of people not helping me for years and not a single person besides my sister who actually witnessed what I went through said “hey that’s messed up” without justification. My mom came back and was furious at me so my grandmother used those bit picks to complain about me like how I didnt clean throughout the week and only deep cleaned on weekends, my mom knows this. how i brought my laptop to watch a movie while making breakfast for my brothers She recorded me without my consent and showed my mom. I asked her if she wanted some when I was cooking but she said no. That i never ate her food or only eat bits of it, shes severely overweight and makes unhealthy food and ive been going on a diet since before she got here, the only veggies in there get drowned out by sauce but i do try it in front of her to show respect but she makes enough for 4 people when it’s just us, my sister isn’t here to make up the difference. i asked her about it multiple times and she implied she knew i was on a diet by making comments on my body/ prep meals for those curious i went from 300lbs -> 260lbs. she was mad that when she asked for a towel for my brother I threw it over the balcony to her when Me, My Mom, and my Sister has done this for years since i was 10 so it was instinctual, not out of hate. Lucky my mom did say that She understood where I came from because we live in houses that has a few floors whike while grandmother only as one floor so this never happens. That was the only time she defended me.  How that I wait for the grass to get too long before cutting it, Its my moms grass and she takes pride in it so anything thats related to it I run by her before I cut it or water it, it’s like a fun competition between her and my stepdad so I want to help her win. My mom told me that I should listen to my grandmother as if she was my mother. Every time my mom comes back my grandmother pulls her aside and says how awful I was when i was on my best behavior and my grades was A-B’s, my mom would eat it up.

My grandmother been sucking up to me so we can still have a relationship and when confronted a few months ago she said she did it to toughen me up when all it did was give me trauma and has yet to take accountability so I refuse to give her that pleasure, I was tricked into going into an intervention. sometimes she would offer to drive me to events like school football games or homecomings, I ALWAYS pay for my own ticket so she doesn’t have to and go to the events rarely, i go mostly to get better at talking and yelling for long periods of time because I had a very bad stutter and nobody could understand me because i mumbled. Most of my classmates talk to me when I get there because I’m one of the popular kids for some reason. “Now I can hold entire conversations. i appreciated her taking me and I do offer to repay her in some way but she declines because i try to be fair in some way. outside of that, for my mom i try to do more but for my grandmother its more of a ""Ill pay for your food""/""I owe you"" type of thing. 

after i blew up on her the first week she has left me alone most days and i told her i dont mind if she calls me for something as long as its not the second i go back in my room, i rather get all the tasks done in one sitting then do it back and fourth, she understood but still critisizes me for minor stuff i dont get immediately because I’m the mornings and night i don’t wear my glasses so i don’t notice stuff at first but if pointed out i can still see it, i do look around before i go into another room. I almost never have outbursts or yell because I don’t like the way my throat feels after, but shes one of the few people that can push my buttons.


TLDR Anyway, I don’t want to invite her to my graduation because she refuses to take accountability for when she put me through and constantly crosses my boundaries would i be an a-hole for sticking to what I said and continuing going NC and im still holding a grudge 7-8 years later

My bf (30m) and I (27f) have been together for almost 2 years. He has a kid (8yo) from a previous relation. 

We have dealt with economic since the begining. He is a bartender and I work for the state. He hasn't have a stable job since a year ago. That means that in the last year I've been paying almost everything (rent, bills, food, etc.). 

I was atacked at job 7 months ago that resulted in PTSD so I've been on sick leave since then. I've been working on it with a psychologist and a psyquiatrist. No medication is working well for now but we keep trying. In adition to PTSD I've major depression and anxiety. I know the situation is complicated but I'm trying my best.

2 months ago we moved to a bigger house beacuse he wants his kid to live with us. I paid the signal for the new house, the moving, etc. because at the moment he had no job. He has continued to not having a job and things are getting worse. 

He gets up at 14h, makes a coffee and turns on the PS5. He spents almost all the day playing. He does nothing at home: no laundry, no cleaning, no nothing. Obviously he doesnt pay beacuse he doesnt have a job nor savings. He has been draining all my money leaving me in the situation that i have almost no savings. 

We do nothing as a couple since lots of months ago and he now blames me because I dont feel like going for a walk or so because the medication leaves me dizzy and tired. 

Today I had enough. We started arguing and he took me to the point I had a melt down and told him he is not contributing to the relationship nor the house and he cant blame me for being sad and alone all the time when the maximum interaction he has with me is asking for money or cigarrettes. I told him he has done nothing for the last 6 months and doesn't even care about the struggle of my situation. 

I slammed the door and went to my home office. We didn't say a word in three hours. He came to the bathroom when I was having a shower asking if i wanted to do something together. I just said a rude ""no"". He told me he wanted to fix things and be okey together as a couple. I told him that was not the moment to have a conversation. He asked if i didn't want to fix things and I told him that at that moment i was tired of fighting for a home, a relationship and with all my mental health problems and i wanted to fix nothing.

- difficulties sleeping

I went on ppis, first week 20 mg in the morning and with my last meal. Second week just with the last meal. 

I would do intermittent fasting for me it was eating at noon and another meal before 7pm. 

Game changers!!! I ate after every meal 1-2 spoons of organic sauerkraut with live culture and I took 2-3 small sips from potato juice. These 2 things worked magic for me. I also took vitamin D and magnesium before I went to bed. I think the magnesium also played a big role.


Other things I did or was avoiding.

No alcohol and no coffee

Just water 

Enough sleep

Exercise 

being on a keto diet 

If you wanna heal I think you have to avoid everything that has potential for  inflammation. 

My personal big triggers is fast food, sodas, alcohol and garlic 


also stay away from sugar in general. I did the keto diet and stayed under 20 grams of carbs a day.

Anyway Mr Bevirt, how about putting some shirts, tumblers, water bottles, and coffee mugs up for sale on your website? Maybe even an S4 scale model?

I know that some may dismiss this action as putting the cart before the horse. I get that. But yall are working hard and Christmas is coming soon. I would love to see my friends and family rocking a piece of history even if they don't know it yet.

Even better if a good share of those profits could go to some function that helps boost the morale of the rank and file employee. Breakfast tacos are always a popular choice. 👍",4,1728843271.0,JobyAviation,0,0.75,False

I'm a simple man.

I like my coffee hot. My music loud. And my butts big and jiggly (or toned… love that big “shelf butt” look).

The heart wants what it wants. And my heart gets pounding when I see a girl with a little waist and a big butt. 

Also, fun fact, my band once recorded in the studio where Sir Mix-a-Lot laid down ""Baby Got Back"" so I feel like it's indirectly my destiny to end up with a big booty girl.

I'm looking for the real deal, and I don't want anything less. Traditional marriage, big family, mutual obsession, and a deeply integrated life together

I'm an intense guy. I do everything to 11/10. I like to have fun and relax but I tend to make everything into work of some kind. I'd love to end up with a girl who's more chill and centers me.

I'm a homebody and definitely wanting to end up with a girl who's a happy medium between homebody and active lifestyle. I want someone who will get me out of the house more but if she's too active, I know I won't keep up. 

I work in marketing and am looking to provide for a family. I want a woman who would be fulfilled as a homemaker. I don't think career women make particularly good wives or mothers and I'm completely unwilling to compromise on that (Okay, I lied, if you wanted to be an OnlyFans girl I'd compromise on that ;).

I'm politically conservative, christian, and socially conservative in all ways but sexually.

I'm tall, I have broad shoulders, dadbod build, I shave my head, I wear glasses and have a beard. My hands are huge and strong, and my cock is thick and veiny. 

If you're the kind of girl I'm looking for, hit me up. No liberals, no married/attached women (why do so many of you write me????), and no women intent on maintaining their careers.",1,1728843162.0,ImpregPersonalsLTR,0,1.0,False
1g2vwx4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g2vwx4,"Self Proclaimed Conspiracy Theorist, Racist, Hateful Bigot Man of the House on Noble said he DOESN’T LIKE all the people that are in his area post Hurricane Milton, which includes linemen! ","“Times of great tragedy can bring out the best in the human spirit: ordinary people show extraordinary courage, compassion, and generosity in helping kin, neighbors, and strangers to recover and build lives”. 
Not Awkward Aaron though, the unemployed grifter. 

They start off the video by recognizing the reason why their small town is overcrowded post hurricane Milton. People that ran out of gas trying to evacuate, linemen coming from all over to help restore power. Overall, a community seeking shelter from a tragic event that altered a lot of lives. So what is Aaron’s response to that? HE DOESN’T LIKE IT!!!! HE DOESN’T LIKE “ALL OF THE PEOPLE THAT DON’T LIVE THERE TO BE THERE”. WOW. Just wow. How selfish, how mean to even think that considering the stress and damage people suffered. Trust me, Aaron, people don’t want to be in your small hick town where racist and hateful unemployed people like you live. Trust me. They are there because they have no other choice, but they are looking forward to leaving as soon as possible. The trucks and the linemen, that came from other states to help restore power, may be an inconvenience to you getting to Starbucks but they are essential during this time. Maybe buy them some food and thank them on your way to get coffee? Oh that’s right you would need PayPal donations to be able to do that. Darn. 

You are also where you are not supposed to be, sucking electricity off of your elderly neighbors. You also don’t belong where you find yourself at and it’s time for you to leave. If the “Bidenomics” as you say did not work for you to get a generator then you can’t have power. You said your mom was out looking for a generator all day, so the Bidenomics work for her? Get a real job and the economics might work for you. ",1,1728843161.0,YoutubeResellerDrama,1,1.0,False

Is this worth raising for coffee production?,I didn't catch any half decent grubbins but I got this Aron with double coffee. The subs all look good but lack of ing+ nature or subs is making me doubt whether it's good enough to invest into (all my other Arons are significantly worse). Since I'm newish (haven't unlocked Lapis yet) I likely won't be able to go to OGPP for a better coffee farmer for a long time.,2,1728843092.0,PokemonSleep,3,1.0,False
