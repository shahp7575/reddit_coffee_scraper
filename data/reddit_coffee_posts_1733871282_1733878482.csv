I've been walking that way my whole life and nothing has ever happened. Today I got followed by a very creepy man and I'm so freaked out by it, I feel like I can't ever go on a walk alone again. I'm currently studying for exams and decided to take a mental health break and go on a walk to the coffee shop. As I was walking back a strange man started to follow me. He was walking across the road from me and crossed the street (in a very random spot with no crosswalk) as soon as he noticed me to get on the same side as me. I started to walk faster and he did too. I get my phone out to try to scare him off but he keeps following me. After a while he stopped following me and randomly went in someone's yard, but behind that yard is the trail that leads to my house. I try to give him the benefit of the doubt and think maybe he just wanted to take a shortcut to the trail. So I take my usual way home and go to walk down the trail, but then I think what if he went in that person's yard to try to ambush me once I walk down the trail. What if he's just in their backyard right next to the trail in the bushes waiting for me to walk by? I decide to wait to see if he comes out of the yard and onto the trail, to see if he just took a shortcut like I thought he did but he doesn't come out. 5 minutes pass by and he hasn't come out onto the trail, meaning he's randomly in that person's backyard waiting. I'm waiting behind a building all the way up the trail and waiting for him to come onto the trail so I know he's not just hiding there waiting for me. Finally, after 10minutes I see him walk out of that backyard's bushes and onto the trail. WTF. That guy was hiding in the bushes of a random old lady's backyard waiting for me to walk by for 10minutes. Can you imagine what would've happened if I didin't think about it like I did? I would've just walked down the trail and he would've been waiting in those bushes for me. Creepiest thing I ever experienced as a woman 😅",1,1733878210.0,women,1,1.0,False

I'll try my best to keep everything together this last week's just been.. alot. I'm sending this out to whoever finds it, I don't expect anyone to believe it but, I need to get it off my chest. 

----My parents headed out on Monday, this weird work trip I don't know I've never really pried, sounds like some excuse to hang out in a fancy hotel, and all I know is they should've been gone for at least the week. Me being.. i mean a late teen without enough hobbies, usually takes it as a break, to bum around the house, relax, what you're picturing basically, Just me and my mom's cat Alice. 



----For the most part that first day was normal I think, I was tired but nothing really, noteworthy? But it was getting late and I was really feeling that second coffee, thinking I'd level out, go sit on the steps by the door and have a smoke. I stepped out in my pjs and.. damn it was cold.. like eye watering, nose running, painfully cold. I wasn't out there for long, I don't think I could have, and between the snow outside and the snacks I knew waited for me in the kitchen? I headed in pretty quick. After a few minutes of raiding the cupboards I heard Alice wadlle into the kitchen behind me, I glanced over and she meowd at me, mooching like always, with a faint grin I leaned back on the counter, shaking my head and just before I could make make fun of her.. I heard another? Another meow.. like down the hallway. It was way too dark, I mean all the lights were off except for the kitchen ones over us, and I was staring at the cat, she didn't move.. I got a chill down my spine, my heartrate picked up, and i got deathly still, trying to not make a noise, but just as I started to reason with myself that I'm just high, or I just blinked and missed Alice make the noise.. I heard it again. It was off.. coming from down by my parent room I think, it was raspy, and like it was struggling almost. I tried my best to get Alice to follow me but she heard it too, not batting an eye at me quietly trying to scold her. If I wasn't that tired, that on edge already, I'd probably just turn the lights on and go look too but.. I needed to sleep, my eyes were so heavy, I kept telling myself it wasn't real, I'm just tired, so I walked past the hallway, not turning to look for where she went, and right into my room, shutting the door behind me with my foot and walking towards my bed. I did that stupid little shuffle? Like with your hands out, little steps, trying to find the bed in the pitch black but.. after a few seconds I realized I walked.. way.. too far. I kept going, glancing back but the doors faint outline was consumed by the dark anyways, I started to panic, reaching down till I touched the floor, and reaching around but.. nothing.. not a desk, not a bed, nothing.. looking back it must sound stupid but.. I yelled for help. Screamed.. I screamed. After a few minutes and realizing I was genuinely lost, I begged for anything to happen, anyone to call out or help. I don't really remember what happened next, as weird as it sounds or cliche, I woke up in bed? The lights were still out and it was dark, had to be night, but i could just barely see the light coming from the kitchen under my door, I took a deep breath, weirdly tired, and tried to peice together what happened, best I can manage I must've just passed out at somepoint as I walked in.. 


----I sat there in bed for a good little bit, I've had those naps where you wake up half asleep still but it almost felt like those screams, all that time in the dark genuinely got to me. ""I gotta stop smoking"" I mumbled to myself and reached over to grab my phone, pulling it out to distract myself, at least till I can pass out again. After probably an hour or two of rotting in bed, zoned out, endlessly scrolling, I swear I heard my door. The only way I can describe it was like If someone tried testing your handle without waking you, just a jiggle of the handle you know? But it was definitely moving, it didn't stop either, for a few seconds before I felt that same wave of fear wash over me, the chill, the ring in my ears, I shut my phone off and didn't have the balls to move, to speak, I just sat there staring at the doors outline through the void of my room. Unable to tell If my eyes were failing as I fought passing out again or the faint shadows at the doors edges were real, I spent so long watching the light.. I got so tired.. I would've probably just gave in if it wasnt for the flies? Not like a swarm but I mean, they were there, and they kept divebombing me, like a mosquito zipping past your ears, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the door but they kept hitting me, landing on my face, testing me and I wish I could say more but again I just.. woke up in bed.. I had to have passed out again.


----Tuesday then, I guess, honestly the whole few days blurred together I wish I could be more exact I just know it was light out when I woke up again though. I sat up, got out of bed, and realized how weak I felt, heavy, like every movement was this monstrous task, every step took more effort than it should as I worked my way back towards the door. I feel embarrassed admitting it now but It took me a good few minutes to open the door.. I stared at that handle like it was red hot, like the shit you picture in the corner of your eye at night, that vuage shapless monster, was on the other side of that door waiting for me, still testing to see if i locked it. I eventually opened the door, I stepped out, and I looked both ways in dead silence before walking towards the bathroom, down that same dark hallway, not really thinking about it in the moment but the second I got into the room I shut the door and locked it behind me, turning on the dim lights, dropping my phone on the counter and splashing water in my face at the sink to wake up. Looking at myself and noticing how bloodshot my eyes looked, how dark the bags under them were, I shook my head and stripped down as I walked to the shower, stepping into it, shutting the glass door carefully and letting the warm water rush over me, I couldn't help but lean back against the wall and slide down till I was sitting in the corner on the floor of the shower, facing the glass as my eyes fluttered open and closed, over, and over. I don't think I've ever been this tired, it didn't stop, it didn't  get better, I needed rest. As the hot water hummed away, running over me, beading up on the glass as steam fills the room, I actually felt a little relaxed, i let myself take a deep, long, blink. My eyes stung, the lids felt glued shut ""fuck.."" i mumbled to myself weakly, but I forced them open, and as I looked up at the glass, I immediately regretted not letting myself fall into that deep sleep my body was begging for.. through the thousands of beads along the glass, a distorted, not totally clear outline of, at least what looked like, a naked.. old.. man.. was standing there just watching me sit on the cold tile.. i couldnt tell if his arms were too long, or his body was too short, it couldve just been my eyes again but.. I've never felt so caught off guard, vulnerable, but nomatter what ran through my mind I couldn't for the life of me move. I wanted to scream, to make a break for it, but he was so close to the glass, and I was so horrified. I sat there, staring back at him, my heart feeling like it was gonna pound out through my ribs, my eyes straining to keep open, and on him. I waited for so long I had pins an needles through my legs, the hot water mustve ran out after a half an hour, i had goosebumps down my entire body as the water ran cold, shaking slightly, till the point of my breath becoming visible, I was starving, and so tired..  but i didnt let myself move out of fear of provoking him. I couldn't help it, I couldn't keep them open, I felt my eyes shutting and as terrified as I was of letting my eyes drift off of him.. they shut, and eventually, woke up again. Curled up just like before, against the tile, goosebumps still rittling my skin from head to toe ""it was a dream.. I need to sleep.. it's a dream"" 




----after an hour or two I had managed to get up again, and mostly dressed, fearing every blink, praying i didnt pass out again, or see anything.. with nothing but sleep on my mind, I just barely pried the door open and stepped out into the hallway. I stumbled down towards my room, hand on the wall, feeling something dribble down my top lip but just before I reached up I heard this.. horrific scream behind me.. for help. My mom's voice was so crystal clear, begging for help, I just mumbled to myself ""ill wake up.. I'll wake up.. I'll wake up"" I walked away from her voice, tears welling up in my eyes, my throat swelling, wether I believed it or not.. it was her voice. ""I just fell asleep again.. its not real.."" I kept walking as she sobbed. I didn't remember shutting my eyes, or fighting sleep off.. but it had to be fake itd only been like.. 2 days? They couldn't have been back.. 
I walked into my room, through the dark as her voice echoed through my head, tossing my phone towards my side table as I crawled into bed, crying quietly as I laid back and stared at the ceiling ""ill wake up.."" I reached up to wipe tears away away, my eyes in so much pain as I listened to her losing her voice down the halway before stopping... just dead silence. My phone went off beside my head at somepoint.. cast a glow into my room.. just barely enough light that.. I saw it.. him.. standing there.. he was beside my bed, just like the shower just.. looking over me.. I didn't move my eyes from the ceiling as I started to shake, and mumble to myself ""ill just wake up.. I'll wake.. up.."" 




----I did, at somepoint.. I must've, but I'm only getting worse, whatever is happening is only getting more vivid.. more real. I can't stay here I just needed to have this somewhere, to say it outloud, my parents aren't here, alice is gone, the.. thing.. isn't here.. I don't know what to do, who to call, but im leaving..

The choice depends on your preferences, budget, and the level of discoloration. Regardless of your choice, it's essential to follow instructions closely to avoid sensitivity or other side effects.

### Is Teeth Whitening Right for You?

Exploring the Safety and Effectiveness of Teeth Whitening Treatments
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening treatments have gained immense popularity in recent years, with many individuals eager to achieve a brighter smile. Whether it's for a special occasion or simply to enhance one's appearance, numerous options are available. However, ensuring the safety and effectiveness of these treatments is crucial before diving in.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding Teeth Whitening Options

There are several methods of teeth whitening available today. Each comes with its own pros and cons, making it essential to understand what each entails:

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These are formulated to remove surface stains using mild abrasives. They are safe for daily use but often provide only minimal results.
- **Over-the-Counter Whitening Kits:** Products like gels and strips can be purchased at drugstores. They typically contain lower concentrations of bleaching agents, making them less effective than professional treatments but safer for home use.
- **Professional In-Office Treatments:** Dentists offer powerful whitening solutions that can lighten teeth multiple shades in a single session. These treatments use higher concentrations of bleaching agents, ensuring faster, more noticeable results, although they may carry a slight risk of sensitivity.
- **Custom Take-Home Kits:** Provided by dentists, these kits include custom trays that fit your mouth, allowing for more effective application of the whitening solution. They are safer than many over-the-counter options because they are supervised by a professional.

### Safety of Teeth Whitening Treatments

While teeth whitening is generally safe, it is essential to consider potential risks. The primary ingredient in most whitening products is hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. When used correctly, these agents can effectively remove stains without causing harm to your teeth. However, misuse can lead to:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Tooth Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience increased sensitivity during or after the whitening process, particularly with higher concentrations of bleaching agents.
- **Gum Irritation:** If the whitening product comes into contact with the gums, it can cause irritation and discomfort.
- **Uneven Results:** Inconsistent application or ignoring professional advice can result in uneven whitening or a “blotchy” appearance.

To minimize risks, always follow the instructions provided with the whitening product and consult your dentist before beginning any treatments.

### Effectiveness of Various Treatments

The effectiveness of teeth whitening depends largely on the method used:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Generally effective for very mild stains but may not significantly lighten teeth.
- **Over-the-Counter Kits:** Can offer moderate improvement but often take longer to achieve desired results compared to professional treatments.
- **Professional Treatments:** In-office whitening typically yields the fastest and most noticeable results, often reaching several shades whiter in just one visit.
- **Custom Take-Home Kits:** These can produce effective results over time, similar to in-office bleaching but may take several applications.

### Aftercare and Maintenance

Maintaining your brighter smile is essential after the whitening process. Here are some tips to keep your teeth looking their best:

- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit coffee, tea, red wine, and soda, as they can stain teeth quickly after a whitening treatment.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Regular brushing and flossing help prevent surface stains.
- **Schedule Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Professional cleanings help maintain the whiteness and overall health of your teeth.
- **Use Touch-Up Treatments:** Depending on your chosen whitening method, consider periodic touch-ups to maintain brightness.

Achieving a brighter smile through teeth whitening treatments is possible and can be done safely and effectively. By understanding the risks and benefits of different methods, you can make informed decisions that suit your needs. Always seek professional advice when needed, so you can smile with confidence.

### Conclusion

A stunning smile is often just a teeth whitening treatment away. The before and after comparisons reveal the transformative power of these treatments, showcasing vibrant results that can boost confidence and enhance your overall appearance. Many individuals have experienced dramatic changes, with noticeably brighter teeth that light up their faces, making them feel more attractive and self-assured.

However, while the results can be remarkable, it’s crucial to prioritize safety and effectiveness. Not all whitening treatments are created equal. It's essential to research options, whether you choose professional services from a dentist or a convenient at-home method. Ensuring that the treatment you pick is safe for your dental health will prevent potential side effects like sensitivity or gum irritation.

Each person's teeth respond differently, so results can vary widely. It’s also wise to consult with a dental professional before starting any whitening regimen. They can recommend the best course based on your dental history and specific needs, ensuring that you achieve the optimal outcome without compromising your health.

1hbh5sm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1hbh5sm/i_stopped_eating_bread_three_years_ago_and_it/,"I stopped eating bread three years ago, and it changed my life.","""I kept hearing from doctors that bread raises your blood sugar, and instead of bread, you should eat nuts like walnuts, hazelnuts, peanuts, and almonds. These nuts contain a large amount of healthy fats, which help prevent sudden hunger pangs, as they do not raise insulin levels as much as carbohydrates do.  
I said to myself, 'What the hell, I might give it a shot,' and stopped eating bread for two weeks as a test. My god, those two weeks were hell on earth for me. Whenever I got hungry, my hand would keep slipping toward the bread; it was the first thing that came to mind. It was really hard not to eat it, but I managed to avoid it. Since then, I've completely stopped eating all kinds of bread.  
Now, I’ve completely cut out sugar. I brew my own coffee now and then, without sugar, of course (usually Turkish coffee). I started making my own yogurt every Monday; I buy 10 kilos of milk each week. I eat one bowl of my yogurt daily. I’ve completely stopped eating processed foods, fast food, junk food, etc. I started cooking on my own, and the only sweet thing I ever eat now and then is a little bit of fruit—nothing else. I don’t crave any unhealthy food at all. Ever since I stopped eating bread, for example, when someone orders pizza, God forbid, I don’t even eat a single slice. I literally don’t crave it at all, and it's all thanks to stopping eating bread.

Tip for homemade yogurt: 

Let the milk cool until it’s warm enough that your finger won't burn when you dip it in.

Add your culture, then let it sit for 3 to 4 hours. After that, put it in the fridge. This way, your homemade yogurt won’t be sour at all, and you can start eating it the next day. I’ve become a pro at making it, and now I make 10 kilos of yogurt every week.",2,1733877897.0,sugarfree,1,1.0,False

 I have a simple cold brew set up, with a jug - no toddy here. I usually pour it through a stainless steel strainer but some of the smaller coffee sediment makes it through. I find using paper filter takes too long. I’m thinking towards the end of the brew I put the brew in the freezer to get it towards 1-2 degrees so the sediment falls to the bottom, while the clear brew can be poured off the top. In brewing we often use a tiny bit of gelatine (in a slurry), stirred in which works great for clumping the sediment. Adding gelatine might offend some people but with brewing it makes no impact on the taste.

As a physician who lived to be 105, he shaped modern healthcare by prioritizing preventive medicine. He believed that early detection and consistent self-care were vital for long-term health, and his innovative approaches still resonate within the medical community.

His lifestyle was rooted in simplicity and discipline. He started his mornings with a light breakfast, often coffee and olive oil-infused juice, and maintained a lean diet focused on balance rather than indulgence. He saw moderation as a cornerstone of health, emphasizing the value of nourishing the body without overburdening it.

I’m from the western US and I’m a pretty introverted and shy dude, at least when I first meet people. My shy nature makes it difficult for me to make friends irl, so here I am looking for people that share the same interests and are willing to adopt me into their tribe. 

I’m currently working to get a bachelors in biology and I’m a part of a research lab at my university with the hopes of going all the way for a PhD. I know that at 27 I should have more accomplished than I do, but to be honest the first half of my twenties I spent battling an anxiety disorder. I’m good now though although I have to make up for lost time, but I’m a very optimistic and positive person despite dealing with bullying and a bunch of other stuff growing up. Don’t get me wrong despite my introverted nature, I do like going out especially if it’s to a hike but honestly don’t have anyone to do things with, plus school takes up most of my time lately.

As for my interests, I’m very into biology (hence why it’s my major) and really all things nature, astronomy, physics; basically any science. I’m your typical nerdy guy into all the things you can think of when it comes to games on PC, Xbox, and Switch (league, valorant, zombies, resident evil, new vegas, cyberpunk, pokemon) movies (no country for old men, Tarantino films, any horror movie, LOTR, Star Wars) tv shows and reality tv (arcane, sopranos, HOTD, Futurama, ghost adventures, impractical jokers) as well as stuff on YouTube like caseoh, markiplier, stimpee, oneyplays. Oh I also like anime but haven’t been watching it much lately! I’m also pretty into sports baseball is my number one but I also like football, hockey, rugby, UFC and boxing. My sense of humor is pretty bad and can be edgy at times and although I identify with the Green Party (which is pretty far left if you’re not in the US), I am open to people of all backgrounds who can have a normal conversation about it.

Last bit of info— im a pretty avid coffee drinker and I enjoy a beer here and there. No drugs but I am 420 friendly! I have a soft spots for cats and have two of my own they’re my everything. I recently lost a fair bit of weight and am feeling more confident, so this is me trying to put my best foot forward and build something.

- small talk. Again I heard that y’all don’t do small talk. Maybe people were just being nice to my face but I chatted with dozens of people. Whether at bars, on the bus, at a museum, everyone was just super friendly!!

- cleanliness. Krakow was very clean besides cigarette butts and the occasional vodka bottles in the bushes xD it’s a very different atmosphere compared to our cities in the US. I also saw no homeless people. I don’t hate them and I try to sympathize with their situations but I’ve also had the worst encounters with some of them in the US. You treat your people very well there :)

- transportation. I rented a car my first week and quickly realized I didn’t need it. It was also cool to drive stick shift because almost no cars in the US are manual :/ but your buses and trams are so awesome and convenient!!!

- quietness. Everyone is very quiet and polite. No one is listening to music on their speakers, no one is talking loudly on the phones in places like the bus or restaurants, it was a very quiet and peaceful city. Also because all of your cars are sub compact and there are no loud exhausts it was quiet even walking alongside the roads. In the US you can’t even hear yourself think when a bit F-150 speeds past you…

- friendships. I met two very good friends during the last month. They seemed very genuine and were very awesome to meet. I was honestly sad to leave knowing I won’t see them again for a while. I look forward to coming back even more now because of them. The one girl I met was like a walking encyclopedia haha. She showed me all around the city and knew everything about every building and landmark lol. Your education is vastly superior to ours it seems

- your food and milk bars are very nice. The food is very similar to what you might find at a diner in the US. Hot and cheap food. Fried foods, mashed potatoes and gravy, spaghetti, it was all very nice.

- the architect of course. You have the most beautiful churches, museums, and buildings I’ve ever seen. I also liked the river overlooking the other parts of the city

- there are many more things I loved but most of all I just loved you people of Krakow. As someone who’s never left the US I thank you for being so kind to me in my travels. I can’t wait to return :)))

Dislikes

- I didn’t dislike too much and honestly all of my dislikes are probably because I’m not used to this stuff.

- public bathrooms are nearly non existent and you have to pay for the ones that exist. It wasn’t too bad because if I really had to go I’d just go grab a small coffee or something as an excuse to use the bathroom haha

- the club promoters. They were very persistent and got pretty annoying pretty quickly. As soon as they saw me, a single guy who is clearly not European, they would swarm. I was given advice to never go to their clubs because of the high chance of getting drugged/ robbed but they got very annoying.

- your nicotine products are way weaker vs ours. This is actually probably a great thing for the health of your people but as a nicotine addict I hated it 😂 I had to smoke two cigarettes to get the feeling of just one of ours. Again, this is actually probably a positive lol

- the daylight. I am very used to cold weather because I’m from the east coast. But it getting dark at 3 pm in December sucked. I definitely got a little seasonal depression on top of my normal depression haha…

- air quality. I kept getting air quality alerts on my phone but as a young person with no breathing problems I honestly didn’t notice the poor air quality until I went on a hike a few miles from the city and the air was definitely better. It wasn’t so awful but my friends told me it gets way worse in the coldest months of the winter

Anyway thank you all again!! I can’t wait to come back this summer. I love you all :)",8,1733877203.0,krakow,1,1.0,False

1hbgwd2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbgwd2,"So i made kind of a ""collecting"" Herbarium of medicinal plants.","Some of those plants are VERY toxic. Dont ingest them just because youve seen it in my herbarium. This is not medicinal advice. I just made myself a list with plants that contain pharmakological active substance because this is my passion and my academic path. Im going to glue them in when i find them anywhere hwere it is legal to pick and glue them inside my book like a sticker collectonh album.

Some plants can only be medicinally used i a very specific situation, others contain some interesting substances that could be used in pure form but not the plant as a whole because theres a lot more toxic substances in them. 

Book is from Amazon, made acid free, allthough i think they may have coloured the sides with coffee. Looks awesome tho, so i dont really care. Outside is leather. Sadly you cant get it with the tree imprint in this size anymore but without your set.

Glue: Methylcellulose + Phenoxyalcohole + Isopropanole + Water suspension. Very hard to mix since you dont want to heat it with isoprop inside. Just let it ""ripe"" a day or two. I put in the phenoxy alcohol last, when i knew the weight of the mixture. Just play arround a little till you get a texture you like before mixing in the phenoxyalcohole. The phenoxyalcohol wont dissolve completely so you will have a suspension. When the isoprop and water dried away the higher phenoxyalcohole concentration will have some antimicobial propertys since the methylcellulose may act as a culture medium. Also it doest crack the plants by going through the book (at least now) since the methylcellulose is weirdly flexible. The glue is water soluble and can be reversed quite good.

Ink: acid free archive ink, written by hand with an calligraphy pen. I dunked it into the ink because it has so many particles that it didnt really flow out of the ink caetridge i filled with a syringe.

I glued the plants into the book by applying the glue with a paint brush fist, then covering them up with acid free art protection foil till dry enough.

I know this isnt the best way to preserve plants scientificly for as long as possible but it is the coolest way i know. Also i would have used a book with lager sides if there would have been one.

Its for peronal not scientific use! Sadly i can only upload 20 pictures in this post so i will spam some in the comment section. ",26,1733877130.0,botany,30,1.0,False
1hbgwam,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/1hbgwam/the_allopathic_complex_its_consequences_complete/,The Allopathic Complex & Its Consequences - complete,"The following is Luigi's ALLEGED manifesto, leaked to Substack, scribed by me, for you:

\*note: the term allopathic is intentional. the Greek roots translate to ""the opposite of suffering"" 

The second ammendment means I am my own chief executive and commander in chief of my own military. I authorize my own act of self-defense in response to a hostile entity making war on me and my family. Nelson Mandela said, ""There's no form of violence can be excused."" Camu says, ""It's all the same, whether you live or die or have a cup of coffee."" MLK says, ""Violence never brings permanent peace."" Gandi says that, ""Nonviolence is the mightiest power available to mankind."" That's who they tell you are heroes - that's who are revolutionaries are. Yet, is that not capitalistic? Nonviolence keeps the system working at full speed ahead. What did it get us? Look in the mirror. They want us to be nonviolent so that they can grow fat off the blood they take from us. The only way out is through. Not all of us will make it. Each of us is our own chief executive - you have to decide what you will tolerate. 

In Gladiator 1, Maximus cuts into the military tattoo that identifies him as part of the Roman Legion. His friend asks, ""is that the sign of your god?"" As Maximus carves deeper into his own flesh and as his own blood drips down his skin, Maximus smiles and nods yes. The tattoo represents the emperor, who is god. The god emperor has made himself part of Maximus' own flesh. The only way to destroy the emperor is to destroy himself. Maximus smiles through the pain because he knows it is worth it. 

These might be my last words. I don't know when they will come for me. I will resist them at all costs. That's why I smile through the pain. 

They diagnosed my mother with severe neuropathy when she was 41 years old. She said to started 10 years before, with burning sensations in her feet and the occasional sharp stabbing pains. At first, the pain would last a few moments, then fade to tingling, then numbness, then fade to nothing a few days later. The first time the pain came, she ignored it. Then it came a couple of times a year, and she ignored it. Then every couple of months. Then a couple times a month. And then a couple times a week. At that point, by the time the tingling faded to numbness, the pain would start and the discomfort was constant. At that point, even going from the couch to the kitchen to make her own lunch became a major endeavor. She started with Ibuprofen until the stomach aches and reflux made her switch to \**something*\* Then the headaches and barely sleeping made her switch back to Ibuprofen. 

The first doctor said it was psychosomatic - nothing was wrong. She needed to relax, destress, sleep more. The second doctor said it was a compressed nerve in her spine - she needed back surgery, it would cost $180,000 dollars. Recovery would be 6 months minimum before walking again, 12 months before a full potential recovery and she would never lift more than 10 pounds of weight again. The third doctor performed a nerve conduction study, electromiography, MRI and blood test. Each test costs $800-1200 dollars. She hit the $6,000 deductible of her United Healthcare plan in October. Then the doctor went on vacation and my mother wasn't able to resume tests until January when her deductible reset. 

The test showed nueropathy. The $180,000 surgery would have no effect. They prescribed opioids for the pain. At first, the pain relief was worth the price of constant mental fog and constipation. She didn't tell me about that until later. All I remember is we took a trip for the first time in years. When she drove me to Montreal to go to the aquarium, I saw an otter in real life swimming on his back. We left at 7am and listened to Green Day on the four hour car ride. Over time, the opioids stopped working. They made her more sensitive to pain and she felt withdrawal symptoms after just two to three hours. Then Gabapentin. By now, the pain is so bad she couldn't exercise, which compounded the weight gain from slowed metabolic rate and hormonosis. And it barely helped the pain. And made her so fatigued, that she would go an entire day without getting out of bed. Then \*something else\*, which didn't even work. The pain was so bad I would hear my mother wake up every night screaming in pain. I would run into her room, asking if she was okay. Eventually, I stopped getting up. She'd yell out angry shrieks of wordless pain - the word ""fuck"" stretched and extended to its limits. I turn over and go back to sleep. All of this while they bled us dry with follow-up appointment after follow-up appointment, specialist consultations, more imaging scans... each appointment was promised to be fully covered - until the insurance claims were delayed and denied. 

Allopathic medicine did nothing to help my mother's suffering. Yet it is the foundation of our entire society. My mother told me that on a good day the nerve pain was like her legs were being submersed in ice water. On a bad day, it felt like her legs were clamped to a machine - shot wise ? - screwed down to where the crank stopped turning, then crushed further until her ankle bone splintered and cracked to accomdate the tightening clamp. She had more bad days than good. My mother crawled to the bathroom on her hands and knees. I slept in the livinig room to create more distance from her cries in the night. I still woke up and went back to sleep. Back then I thought there was nothing I could do. The high copays made consistent treatment impossible. New treatments were denied as ""not medically necessary"" or treatments didn't work and they still put us out for thousands of dollars. United Healthcare limited specialist consultations to twice a year. Then they refused to cover advanced imaging, which the specialist required for an appointment. Prior authorization took weeks, then months. United Healthcare constantly changed their claim filing procedure. They said my mother's doctor needed to fax his notes. Then United Healthcare said they did not save faxed patient correspondance - they required a hard copy of the doctor's notes to be mailed. Then they said they never received the notes. They were unable to approve the claim until they received and filed the notes. They promised coverage. They broke their word to my mother. 

With every delay, my anger surged. With every denial, I wanted to throw the doctor through the glass wall of their waiting room. But it wasn't them. It wasn't the doctors, or the receptionist, administrators, pharmacists, imaging technicians or anyone we ever met. It was United Healthcare. People dying. Evil has become institutionalized, corporations make billions of dollars off the pain, suffering, death and anguish, cries in the night of millions of Americans. We entered into an agreement for healthcare with a legally binding contract that promised care with our insurance payments and medical needs. Then United Healthcare changed the rules to suit their own profits. they think they make the rules, that because it's legal - that no one can punish them. They think there's no one out there who will stop them. Now my chronic back pain wakes me in the middle of the night, screaming in pain, I sought out another type of healing that showed me the real antidote to what ails us. I bide my time, saving the last of my strength to strike my final blows - all extractors must be forced to swallow the bitter pain they deal out to millions. As our own chief executives, it's our obligation to make our own lives better. 

First and foremost, we seek to improve our own circumstances and to defend others. As we do so, our actions have ripple effects that can improve the lives of others. Rules exist between two individuals in a network that covers an entire Earth. Some of those rules are written down, some of those rules emerge from nature - respect between two individuals. Some of those rules are defined in physical laws like the properties of gravity or the potential energy stored in the chemical bonds of potassium nitrate. No single document better encapsulates the belief al people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status and the framework for fostering collective wellbeing than the U.S. Constitution. Writing it down makes it law - I don't give a fuck about the law. Law means nothing, What does matter is following our own guidance and our own logic and what we will learn from those before us to maximize our own wellbeing. Which will then maximize our loved ones and community. That's where United Healthcare went wrong. They violated the contract with my mother and me and tens of other millions of Americans. 

This threat to my own health, my family's health and health of our country's people requires me to respond with an act of war.

Tbh I'm just used to being so clear and then I went through living in an environment where ultimately I chose to go pretty dark and am bouncing back.

He said countless times but never officially asked me out. When we make plans, he often cancels them - usually with a few days notice but always has some excuse. For example, we were supposed to meet for a coffee this weekend but he was unable to as his mother was picking up his sister from uni up country and he had to look after his brother (who's fourteen). Furthermore, I moved about two hours away in September for work and told him that February beforehand and suggested we meet up before I go. He said we would and planned a few times to meet, but always cancelled. I'm back again for Christmas and said we would meet up, but he's cancelled again (the excuse being him babysitting his brother, as mentioned before).

Springdale (Right Outside the Park):
- Whiptail Grill: This converted gas station serves incredible Mexican fusion. Their fish tacos are to die for!
- MeMe's Cafe: Perfect for breakfast. The banana bread French toast changed my life.
- Zion Canyon Brewing Company: Great craft beers and pub food. The beer-battered onion rings are crispy perfection.
- Oscar's Cafe: Massive portions and killer burgers. The Southwestern vibe is on point.

Hurricane (25 minutes away):

Humans live in a world with dragons but they were heavily hunted. There are different color dragons that reflect their type (fire, underground, water, etc) the MMC is a dragon shifter Prince and his scales turn gold to indicate he'll be the next prince. He's sent to human town to live among them and find the next queen. 

Meanwhile a dragon is hunting (eating) humans. This is racking up the tensions with the humans and dragons... (eventually leads to a battle scene book 3 maybe?)
The girl hangs out with the dragon shifter but doesn't find out he's her dragon friend until later. She also discovers her ex is the MMC's brother (his name is Marcus!)  who's the dragon eating people and has a history of abusing his gfs. 
More details- FMC works at a coffee shop which is where she first meets the MMC and other dragon shifters that come into play.

She ends up competing in the dragon queen trials and wins to become the next dragon queen.

in July this year I had a crush on a friend (we r both female I'm gay and she's bisexual) I've known her since we were like 12 (I'm 25 now) i confessed to her, she rejected me but said it was cool and we could still be friends.  
To me her actions after that were confusing, that same night after she rejected me she tried to kiss me (I didn't kiss her back), she held and stroked my hands, and she said stuff like, we would be a cute couple, she knows that I'd treat her really well, she even told me that night that six months prior to that SHE had feelings for ME but she didn't anymore. she also said if I was still single in 5 years she would wanna date me.  
to me this was all mixed signals but we were both a bit drunk.

A bit of background I've lived an extremely sheltered life and although I'm in my mid 20s this was only the second time I got drunk.  
I felt the rejection wasn't clear so I asked her for coffee and during the coffee I asked if she could give me a clear rejection. she said she still didn't wanna say ""never"" and she could see herself dating me in the future.

A couple of weeks after this, one of my work friends was having a leaving drinks. these work friends didn't know the girl but I had told them the whole story and they said her actions were confusing and they thought she was using me for attention.  
this was my 3rd time ever drinking and I got super drunk, I drunk a jug of aperol spritz. i called up the girl (my crush).  
she didn't pick up and messaged saying she was watching television with her dad and she was busy.  
I messaged again saying ""Please can you take a break and call me, I wanna speak to you"" so she called me.  
We had a phone conversation for 4 minutes. during the conversation we talked about a bunch of random shit but I did say at some point ""My friends think ur being mean to me"" which was a shitty and stupid thing to do looking back, but I honestly wasn't intending to hurt her and I don't know why I said it.

the next day she messaged me saying that she wanted to take a break from our friendship and it really hurt to know my work friends thought she was being ""mean"".  
I said of course, I'm really sorry. and didn't message her again until a couple of weeks later, being like I miss you and I'm really sorry I upset you.  
She said that she had had a massive breakdown because of my phonecall, and she wanted to go back to our friendship but she just couldn't.  
This really worried me because last time she had a breakdown, she attempted suicide and ended up in hospital. So I messaged her best friend (I know this person but we aren't super close) asking if she was ok and can I do anything.  
Her best friend sends me like paragraphs saying how I made a phonecall just to be mean to her, I pressured her into taking the call, I ""didn't take no for an answer"" in response to a romantic rejection.  
after this the girl messages me saying that it was a massive boundary cross, the fact that I messaged her best friend, and she also said ""Please don't contact me again.""  
I haven't contacted her again since then.

I feel just awful. It was in early august but I have genuinely thought about this every day since then. i feel so so so guilty. i feel like a terrible person. It truly wasn't my intention to hurt her. i really miss her and I feel awful that I caused her to have a mental breakdown. I feel terrible that I made her feel pressured into taking my phone call. because she was nothing but nice to me. and I didn't mean to ""not take no for an answer"" in regards to a romantic rejection, I think maybe thats because i asked her for coffee and to clarify things? maybe that made her feel pressured or that i wasnt taking no for an answer? Idk it really stresses me out. She and that group of friends unfollowed me, removed me from the groupchat. they all think im a terrible person and they all hate me probably.

reading this back it all seems like such immature highschool drama bs but idk how it got out of hand like this.

idk how to get over this situation but i genuinely have never had an argument with anyone before or upset anyone like this so thats why this felt like such a big deal to me.",3,1733876220.0,DecidingToBeBetter,6,0.8,False

1hbgkeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1hbgkeg/dealing_with_gi_issues_since_september_without/,Dealing with GI issues since September without knowing what's causing my symptoms,"**Long post alert**

Before you read my story, here's a little bit about me. I'm a male in my 20's who is going through a barbaric GI episode and trying to find answers to my problems.

In the first week of September, I noticed a change in my bowel movements. I'd have this random feeling to go to the bathroom out of the blue without even eating anything. The frequent bowel movements usually started after my morning breakfast and no matter how many times I pass my stools, I'd feel incomplete like I'd still have to be back after a while. I also noticed small amounts of mucus every now and then but it didn't concern me much.

While this continued, one day I noticed a small amount of blood (could say less than 2 drops) in my stool. I did not have any other issues like constipation or pain. Went to a GI doctor for the same and was told not to worry about it as he said that it could have been due to anal fissures or hemorrhoids. Gave me some meds and did not see blood or mucus until I was consuming them. Once the meds were over, the frequent bowel movements and mucus-y stools started.

Again went to the doc and he ordered blood and stool tests. The blood tests came back with slightly elevated levels of Eosinophils and Amylase whereas the stool test indicated the presence of bacteria. Was put on a different round of meds again. This time my symptoms worsened and started experiencing foul smelling semi-solid stools pretty much every single time I had to poop. God I wish I could describe how awful the smell was. I still noticed mucus just like before. I really wanted to resist the feeling of having to poop because of the horrendous smell but I couldn't help it. I gotta say that at this point I forgot how normal poop would look/smell like because it was semi-solid with an awful smell every time.

  
The meds did not work for me this time as my problems still continued to persist. I told the doc that this isn't working out and he suggested to take stool culture test as my initial stool test showed the presence of bacteria and endoscopy. The stool culture test came back normal with the comment ""Normal flora growth and no enteric pathogens like Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., and Vibrio sp. were isolated"". The endoscopy came back with ""Mild Antral Gastritis. LAX LES / Hiatus Hernia"". The doc said that he was clueless as to why this is happening to me. He suggested to continue the meds but at this point I was so frustrated because the meds weren't working for me. 

  
I stopped the meds for a week and I again noticed blood covered in the mucus of my stool again. I panicked and I decided to get a second opinion from another GI doctor.

Went to this new GI doc in October. Explained everything to the new doc and I was asked to recall the list of all foods that I ate in the last couple of days. He asked me whether the frequent bowel movements/mucus in stool started after eating certain foods that contain gluten or diary because the foods I ate the previous day did contain a lot of gluten. As for diary, I'd drink coffee only when I feel like I want to. He suggested that I might be gluten/lactose intolerant and asked me to experiment with these two. He asked me to stop consuming gluten/diary to see if my bowel movements improved. As a matter of fact, it did improve for like a week. If I have to put a number, I'd say probably like a 40%. The smell of my poop didn't change much but the frequency of my bowel movements somewhat improved. 

He asked me to carry on this gluten/lactose free diet for 2 weeks but he said that I'd still have to get a colonoscopy in order to rule out the possibilities of polyps and hemorrhoids. Suggested to get my blood tested for deficiencies as the previous one didn't test for it. The tests came back with a moderate Vitamin D deficiency and I was given supplements for the same. At this point, the vitamin supplements were the only meds I was taking besides following a GF/LF diet.

  
After going through the horrible phase of prepping for colonoscopy, I finally got it done. Guess what. The tests came back squeaky clean with no polyps or hemorrhoids. But for 3 days after my colonoscopy,  I truly felt better as I passed normal smelling stools without mucus. The frequency of bowel movements drastically reduced from what it used to be and I was over the moon that things have finally settled. But I was wrong. Though I didn’t poop much often, I again noticed blood covered in mucus.

My doc was as confused and clueless as me. Suggested to take IgE and food allergy test. The IgE test came back with elevated levels (454 IU/mL) and the food allergy test came back normal citing that I had no allergies towards any food. My doctor is not aware of this test result yet as my appointment isn’t until next week.

I’m still following a GF/LF diet as of today since October so if I’m allergic/intolerant then I should feel much better when I don’t consume them. I really don’t know what’s going on with me and I’d appreciate if someone could offer some guidance. Thanks for giving this a read.",1,1733876162.0,FoodAllergies,3,1.0,False

I (24F) and my brother (21M) both have a joint bank account with my mom as the second person on the account. We always had this, my mom has never stolen from us, and it gives her a sense of security. Recently, my mom has undergone some fraudulent activity on her one bank account and signed up for withdrawal alerts via text message to give her piece of mind. However, since my and my brother's accounts are joint to hers, she gets alerts whenever we make any withdrawls (how much and where) and there is no limit. Since this has been in place, I've gotten calls immediately after purchasing things like coffee or gas from her. It has been very violating and try to make purchases with my credit card or cash, as after a stern conversation, she won't adjust the amount. 

  
Second piece of background information, my brother has a good trade job that requires some work travel trips. On these trips, however, they do the work during the day and then usually participate in activities such as drinking, going to bars or even taking trips to the strip clubs in the area of work at night. My brother enjoys the strips clubs and has spent hundreds of dollars on tips, VIP rooms and lap dances. My family has a pretty open relationship, where he will spill all of the work trip drama to everyone. However, he will reserve the ""juicy parts"" for myself or his buddies and tells me to not tell mom, as it will break her heart. He has been on multiple types of these trips and I have been pretty good to keep all information that I learn to myself.

  
Last piece of background information, my mom and late father are against any sort of drug usage, due to past family experiences. I started partaking in the ""mary jane"" in college, but only do it once in a blue moon to help to relax. I have never told my family about it because I don't like confrontation. 

On to the story. One day last week, I had a very stressful day at work. It was a type of day that I wanted to take the ""edge off"" (this usually happens maybe once every six months, depending on the quarter, and I was also dealing with a lot of personal stuff) and decided to swing by a distillery after work (I live in Canada, it is legal). In my tiredness, I made the purchase, however, I put it on my debit card, which is the the joint account with my mom. Then the phone ran, and that when I realized that I messed up. I tried talking her out of it and almost changed the subject until my brother interrupted the phone call and told her what it was to stir the pot (like little brothers do). In rage, I then told my mom about brothers recent strip club activities from two weeks prior (this was before the withdrawal alerts). My mom went silent and then questioned my brother, in which I hung up the phone. My brother refuses to answer my calls, AITA? (I am also trying to get out of my joint account with my mom so this doesn't happen again).

I am currently a SAHM of 3 (to give context) and I have been a landlord for the past 8 years. I haven't particularly liked being a landlord as of course it has its ups and downs, but the past few years I've had great tenants. Those tenants are now moving on to purchasing their own home and I am wondering if this is my sign to sell as I have been contacted by my HOA that my house is fading due to sun exposure and will need to be re-painted soon. Also, after having the AC unit worked on this past summer, the HVAC tech informed me that my unit will probably only last me another 2/3 years. All this to say that as a SAHM, I have no steady income except the passive income my rental provides (1,200 a month pocketed). 

A very brief call to a realtor friend and he estimated about 240 in equity and advised to sell since I am not generating enough income to cover such expenses. I know I will need to speak to my CPA to go over exact numbers and such, but I wanted to check here first to see if I can get some ideas. 

The equity money just wouldn't be enough at the moment to invest in another home/townhouse/condo and so I have a few ideas. I could put the money into a ETF or Roth IRA and wait until I am ready to buy again and rent out my current house. I can pursue my Masters like I have been wanting to without having the dreaded student loan debt hanging over me (In my specialty field I can make about 80k annual income starting). Or I can take a small chunk of it and purse a real dream of mine in opening up a small mobile coffee trailer....I know this option takes a lot of trail and error and major researching, but I am business savvy and I believe it can be profitable in my area (Phx, AZ). Or I can just keep going on with my rental, keep renting it out and figure out how to cover repair expenses?

In the current digital landscape, your bio serves as your initial introduction to potential clients, acting as a virtual handshake that can either pique their interest or lead them to overlook you. It functions as your elevator pitch, a succinct and captivating overview of your identity, your expertise, and your unique value proposition. A well-crafted bio can be a potent instrument for attracting clients, cultivating your brand, and solidifying your position as a leader in your industry.



# The Essential Ingredients of an Engaging Bio

A strong bio is more than just a list of your accomplishments; it's a story that resonates with your target audience. Here's how to craft a bio that not only informs but also captivates:

* **Start with a Hook:** Just like a good book, your bio needs an opening line that grabs the reader's attention. This could be a bold statement, a question, or a brief anecdote that piques their curiosity. For example, instead of saying ""I'm a marketing consultant,"" you could say, ""I help businesses transform their online presence and achieve explosive growth.""  
* **Highlight Your Value Proposition:** Clearly articulate what you offer and how it benefits your clients. What problems do you solve? What unique skills or experiences do you bring to the table? Focus on the value you provide rather than just listing your job titles.  
* **Inject Personality:** Let your authentic self shine through. Share your passions, your values, and what makes you unique. People connect with people, so don't be afraid to infuse your bio with your personality. Are you a dog lover? A coffee aficionado? These small details can make you more relatable and memorable.  
* **Keep it Concise:** Attention spans are short, so keep your bio concise and to the point. Focus on the most important information and use strong verbs and active voice to make your bio dynamic and engaging.  
* **Tailor it to Your Audience:** Your bio should be tailored to the specific platform and audience you're targeting. A bio on LinkedIn will differ from a bio on Instagram or your website. Consider what your audience on each platform is looking for and adjust your bio accordingly.  

# Examples in Action

Let's look at a few examples of engaging bios:

* **Example 1:** ""I'm a freelance writer specializing in crafting compelling content that converts. With a background in journalism and a passion for storytelling, I help businesses connect with their audience on a deeper level. When I'm not writing, you can find me exploring the great outdoors or curled up with a good book.""  
* **Example 2:** ""As a business coach, I empower entrepreneurs to build thriving businesses that align with their values. I believe in a holistic approach that focuses on both strategy and mindset. My mission is to help you achieve your goals and create a business you love.""  

# Beyond the Basics: Optimizing Your Bio

* **Include a Call to Action:** Encourage your audience to take the next step. Do you want them to visit your website? Schedule a consultation? Follow you on social media? Make it clear what you want them to do.  
* **Use Keywords Strategically:** If you're using your bio on a platform like LinkedIn, incorporate relevant keywords that will help people find you. For example, if you're a social media manager, include keywords like ""social media marketing,"" ""content strategy,"" and ""audience engagement.""  
* **Update Regularly:** Your bio is not static; it should evolve as you grow and your business changes. Revisit your bio periodically to ensure it's still relevant and accurately reflects your current offerings.  

Crafting a captivating bio is an ongoing process of refinement and optimization. By following these tips, you can create a bio that attracts clients, builds your brand, and sets you apart from the competition. Remember, your bio is your opportunity to make a lasting impression, so make it count!

1hbg84f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testaimediaplatform/comments/1hbg84f/privacy_breached_a_story_of_hidden_cameras_and/,Privacy Breached: A Story of Hidden Cameras and Trust,"Seattle. Rain. Coffee. The usual. But this time, a chilling story unfolded, a story of privacy breached and trust betrayed. It started with a news report about hidden cameras found in Expedia's Seattle campus, and the story resonated with me deeply. You see, I, Ermenildo Valdez Castro, Jr., or Ernie to my friends, have been a software engineer for years, working at giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and even Zulily. I've seen my share of security protocols, but this story was a whole different beast. 

 This wasn't just a case of a few misplaced cameras; it was a systematic breach of privacy, affecting hundreds of individuals, all because someone chose to abuse their power.  I felt a knot in my stomach, a feeling of violation, as if someone was peeking into my own private space. It brought back memories of the time I almost became a victim of identity theft, a terrifying experience that taught me the importance of protecting my personal information. 

 But it was the  ""blowing off"" by security that really stuck with me. Imagine, reporting a suspicion about a device, only to be dismissed with a phone number to call. That's not security, that's negligence. It's a scary reminder of how easily trust can be broken, how easily vulnerabilities can be exploited.  The lawsuit against the security company is a testament to the need for accountability, for ensuring that our privacy is respected and protected. As a Filipino-American author living in Seattle, I believe in the power of community, in standing up for what is right, and in holding those who betray our trust responsible. This story isn't just about Expedia, it's about all of us, about safeguarding our privacy and ensuring that our digital spaces are secure. 

 It's a call for vigilance, for awareness, and for action. We need to be proactive, to report suspicious activity, to demand better security measures, and to hold those who violate our trust accountable.  It's a reminder that even in the digital age, trust is not something to be taken lightly. 🌎💻👮‍♀️",1,1733875231.0,Testaimediaplatform,0,1.0,False

Does anyone recognize this problem? I am struggling to figure out what's causing it. It started happening pretty early in the oven.

It also happened the first time I made this ... although way more pronounced. This time, I was pretty careful with the exact measurements, and size of the pan.

1hbg6og,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wawa/comments/1hbg6og/terminated_for_cursing_at_my_register/,Terminated For Cursing At My Register,"# Hello Fellow Wawa Associates,

I really need some helpful advice -

I've worked at Wawa for 2 years, 7 months.

On 10/17/2024 I was terminated from Wawa for cursing at my register. I am able to reapply in 6 months but that seems a lifetime away for me. I am 63 years old, I have a degenerative disc disease of my spine and Wawa is supposed to be my last job before I plan to retire at 70. I love working at Wawa and I'm a hard worker. My prior career was a Professional Chef which I did for 30 years so hard work is second nature to me. Because of my health, working as a Cashier at Wawa is a job I'm able to thrive doing. I'm not ready to be put out to pasture just yet.

Let me preface by saying I take full responsibility for my actions This is what happened.

10/17/2024 @ 12:50 pm

My shift ends at 1:30 pm, I look up at my register and my customer is a Wawa Corporate employee and he would like change for a $100 bill. I responded I did not have change and before I could finish to let him know I would get a manager to get change he said,

""We don't do it like that at Wawa!"" He went on to say some other things which I don't quite remember and he demanded to see a manager. When my manager got to the register I was unable to explain anything to her because she zoned right into the Corporate employee and he had her full attention. I continued to wait on other customers while he was explaining to my manager ""This is not how we do it at Wawa!"" And at this point, I have to admit I was starting to get really po'd and I will explain. But first my manager just kept apologizing and nodding her head up and down, agreeing with everything this guy was saying. I had somehow committed such a great offense because I apparently had not followed the proper procedure for giving change. So, this is why I was getting really po'd - What is the proper procedure to give change for a $100 bill? I had seen it done different ways from Associates all the way to the head honcho, the Store manager. Apparently, you are ALWAYS supposed to give a customer change for a $100 bill.

The Wawa Corporate employee has finished explaining to my manager the proper procedure to give change and he is buying something, with a CREDIT CARD! She finishes the transaction and approaches me and I lost it!

Throwing my hands up in exasperation, I said, ""You didn't have my fucking back!""

I was told to go home and when I got to work the following morning, I was terminated. I really like my manager who was working that day. I just wish she had given me the benefit of the doubt but instead I feel she threw me under the bus.

I just want to work at Wawa. I just want to work until I can't. I ran into the Area Manager for my store while getting coffee at my local Wawa and I pleaded my case to him, tears and all but to no avail. I was denied unemployment and I have found a part time job and now I'm just waiting for April.

1hbg4mv,https://www.reddit.com/r/grandcanyon/comments/1hbg4mv/completed_rim_to_river_and_back_in_the_same_day/,Completed rim to river and back in the same day as inexperienced hikers,"Creating this post for the benefit of anybody who is thinking about hiking rim to rim or rim to river and back in the same day but, just like me, is inexperienced with hiking and/or not exceptionally athletic.

I made mistakes in planning and during the hike, they put me in danger. Had I not gotten the help of other kind hikers who took pity on me, the experience would have been much worse. I'm open and honest about my mistakes to help others planning this hike avoid making my mistakes, hopefully I won't be judged too harsly.

Im 36M, just over 200 pounds, go to the gym fairly regularly and lift heavy but not doing a lot of cardio, I can do a 5k but it takes me more time compared to slimmer running body types. Im healthy with no injuries or other health condition that prevents me from physical challenges. I went on the hike with 4 liters of water and 3 bags of salty and sugary snacks, I checked the water availability along the trail the day before the hike. 

**TLDR**; it is doable. I did it. BUT, it took 16 hours and I depended on the help and unselfishness of other hikers. I was woefully unprepared, not in the sense that I hadn't read up on the challenges I could face, but I was unprepared for how that type of hike would affect **me**.

Did the hike in mid October, started down South Kaibab early morning down to the river, the plan was to take Bright Angel back to the rim. I did not cross black bridge but walked along the river trail to the silver bridge. Went across the silver bridge, felt the water in the river and rested for a little while. In the interest of saving time I decided I did not need to walk past the silver bridge towards the Bright Angel campground to fill up my water, as I still had about 2 liters and I thought it would last me until Havasupai Gardens. This, it would turn out, would be the biggest mistake of the entire hike and would have put me in a dangerous situation if other hikers had not helped me.

My legs started cramping as soon as the trail started going uphill after the river resthouse, I had nothing with electrolytes, I tried eating the snacks but my stomach was turning as soon as I started chewing. I had **severely** underestimated how much water I needed. During the course of the 16 hour day I drank 14 liters of water and did not pee once, I have never experienced anything like it.

I powered through the cramps until I started up the devil's corkscrew and that was the worst part of the day. The temperature was at its hottest and the leg cramps were killing me. I just did one or half a switchback at a time and then sat down to rest in between. Two different hikers passing by took pity on me at this point and offered one water bottle each, this was key to me making it out of the canyon at all. I will forever be in their debt.

With the water situation resolved, I pushed on because I still had this stupid and unachievable idea that I could make it up before dark, and I was in a rush to get to Havasupai Gardens and fill up my water bottles.

After the last few switchbacks in the corkscrew and the following the creek towards Havasupai, there was no more pushing through the leg cramps. Every muscle from my waist down to my ankles cramped up. Again I was saved by a passing hiker who offered me a magnesium shot, this wonder cure (placebo or not) successfully got me and my cramped legs to Havasupai Gardens.

The original plan was to hike up before sundown as I did not have a head torch. I only made it to Havasupai Gardens about 2 hours before sundown, so that plan failed miserably.

I rested for about an hour at the gardens, laid down, drank a lot of water, filled up all my water bottles, managed to swallow a small handful of salty and sugary snacks, was again kindly offered support by strangers as they gave me some pickles and other things with electrolytes in them, and started up the trail again.

This final part of the hike turned out to be the best, or the least horrible I guess.

Three things contributed to the final part of the hike being the most chill and actually enjoyable despite my horrible state:

1. As the sun came down and the weather started to cool.  
2. Abandoning the goal of making it up before dark allowed me to manage the pace more cleverly.  
3. With a fully charged phone (and its light) and power bank, the dark was not an issue, even without a head torch.  
4. Bright Angel above Havasupai Gardens has a resthouse with water every 1.5 miles, this provides mentally helpful interim targets to aim for.  
5. The sunset and the complete darkness that followed apart from the odd lamp here and there making its way up the trail was a magical experience. 

I was still exhausted but could essentially work my way up the trail at a manageable pace, with plenty of light (holding the phone in my hand), water and electrolytes. At times I had the energy to push on for a while and other times I did one or two switchbacks at a time.

Made it up to the Bright Angel trailhead after about 16 hours after starting down South Kaibab and could not walk or otherwise make use of my legs  the following 3 days.

The point of telling you all this is to share what I learned to prevent you from making the same mistakes as me and being able to enjoy this awesome experience fully.

1. Physical fitness is important, but more important is *how you react to pshycially straining activities over a long period of time*, more specifically, the very unique act of walking down a mountain and then climbing back up. I saw marathon runners, body builders and young people struggling whilst seemingly overweight, old or otherwise out of shape people were merrily strolling up the trail. The difference? Previous experience doing this type of hiking. I never felt out of breath, or the burning sensation from running when out of shape but I was still at the very limit of what my body could perform. Doing cardio on flat or semi flat surfaces simply does not compare to this.

2. Hiking poles will help a lot. Going down is also tiring for your legs. The poles take some of the load of your legs both going up and down, potentially preventing or at least delaying the onset of cramps.

3. Food and water. The heat in the canyon and the sheer amount of exhausting exercise you are doing demands *a lot* of water. Follow the recommendations for water usage, bring more, even if it is heavy. I stupidly put myself at risk and unfairly presented other hikers with the dilemma of giving up their own water or leave me to die. Do not do it, I was wrong, and I still feel embarrassed and ashamed about it.

4. If you are not feeling well you will not have an appetite. I had these high calorie energy bars and salty nuts and shit. Great, right? Wrong. My stomach turned at the thought of chewing anything, I had to force myself to eat and I felt sick afterwards. Electrolytes, magnesium and water to keep your fluid and minerals in balance is essential to even being able to consume the energy your body so desperately needs.

5. Time is of the essence. I feel like a lot of the problems I had were exacerbated by the fact that I was rushing everything, all for a pointless idea of making it up before dark. Turns out that walking in the dark was the most pleasant part of the hike. I had no *real* need to rush up the trail, I just decided to do it beforehand and abandoned the plan far too late. Had I stopped, rested, gathered water at every point, and accepted the extended time frame for the hike from the beginning, this experience would have turned out very different.

6. Do not take warnings about the difficulties and risks about hiking in Grand Canyon lightly. A lot of us europeans tend to treat warnings and disclaimers in the U.S. as ""hahah stupid Americans and their legal disclaimers"" and whilst that may contain a degree of truth for toasters and hot coffee, that most certainly is not the case for the Grand Canyon. Take it seriously, I felt so vulnerable, afraid and stupid at the bottom of the canyon with cramping legs and low on water.

**In conclusion.** Do the hike, it is an amazing experience. Be prepared, accept that you don't know how your body will react and plan accordingly.

I realize there aren't many Grand Canyon's to practice on, but at the very least prepare by doing some strenuous hiking. If not to sufficiently train your abilities, then at least to teach you what challenges you will face. Can you handle getting blisters on your feet with 10 hours of walking left? Can you handle cramps with so and so many hours to go? Do you have light if you have to carry on in the dark? Bring hiking poles. Do not expect to rely on help in the canyon, I got lucky.

I would do it again. My poor preparedness thankfully did not result in any physical harm to me or anybody else. But the sense of pride and accomplishment that should follow a feat of this kind will be always be tainted in my mind at least. ",3,1733874973.0,grandcanyon,0,1.0,False

**Imaginary Episode Background:** It currently takes California's economy less than 28 days to match Utah's annual G.D.P. Can Utah outcompete California if it turns to theocracy? What would happen to this wide economic gap if Utah decided to become more, not less, theocratic?

SCENE SONG/SOUND: 'in the house in a heartbeat' from 28 days soundtrack:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rfTdF6W7KA&list=PL9BIRiZvlKSQ2nmeTc4dlH\_f9GqurqUXy&index=19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rfTdF6W7KA&list=PL9BIRiZvlKSQ2nmeTc4dlH_f9GqurqUXy&index=19)

**Setting and Context:**

It’s the first anniversary after Utah’s controversial merger of church and state. Well, more controversial than the 8-1 SCOTUS conservative super-majority ruling along ideological party lines.

In a bold—and many would say silly move, the future Governor of Utah declared Mormonism the official (non-federal) state religion. SCOTUS not only allowed it, some thought it was a great idea.  SCOTUS tossed the issue back to the states and Utah declared Mormonism the state's (non-federal) religion.

Now, in Utah, no longer is there any separation between Sunday sermons and Monday board meetings whatsoever; everything is infused with a layer of sanctified oversight.

While the Governor touts this as a new era of moral prosperity, **the economic reality is bleak.**

# Meanwhile, just over the border, California observes with a mix of fascination and schadenfreude. It’s the first year since the merger, and California’s GDP has historically surpassed Utah’s economic output in a mere 28 days.

***This number, a painful reminder of Utah’s inability to compete, becomes a benchmark that shrinks by 7 days each passing decade, as California’s economy continues to outpace its neighbor’s by comical margins.***

**Premise:**

In this episode, we follow a quasi-documentary style as cameras roam the halls of Utah’s new hybrid Church-Capitol building.

The State Capital doubles now as a second church administration building. There is spreading extraordinary mass delusions ( [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24518/24518-h/24518-h.htm](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/24518/24518-h/24518-h.htm) ) and we see legislators in white shirts and ties, poring over scripture-infused trade policies.

A persistent narrator compares the state’s situation to someone in a faith-based rehab: Everyone is in denial about Utah's addiction to religious micromanagement of economics, hoping that simply believing harder will cure their every ill. They instigate trade wars even with other states and they are protected under freedom of religion.

Utah starts focusing on regulating advertising campaigns they deem religiously immoral that depict scantily clad women. Also, rated ""R"" movies and much, much more. We see the purity police of Utah working overtime to make Utah Great Again.

Throughout the episode, each decade is marked by a comedic letter from the State of California to Utah, dripping with both faux concern and gentle mockery.

As the decades roll by, the number of days California needs to surpass Utah’s GDP after the fiscal year starts shrink. Pre-state/church merger, the time it took California to overcome Utah's GDP was 28 days. However, the time it takes California's GDP to overcome Utah's GDP shrinks steadily - highlighting the widening gulf.

**Visual Tone:**

Brightly lit offices with overly cheerful murals of smiling pioneers, stern portraits of past prophets, and pie charts adorned with angelic halos.

A recurring motif is a countdown clock in the corner of the screen—initially set to 28 days—representing how quickly California leaves Utah in the economic dust. California joins other states suing Utah under the commerce clause (and https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C3-7-1/ALDE\_00013307/) to slow or stop Utah's quickly becoming a state no one wants to live or do business but Utah doesn't care.

# Act I: Year One – The Righteous Kick-Off

**Scene:** Church-Capitol Building, Salt Lake City.

Rows of officials sing a hymn before unveiling the state’s new fiscal plan—tithing-based tax codes and faith-driven subsidies for modest attire manufacturers.

**Narration (dry, ironic):**

“In the wake of the merger, Utah decided that the best way to stabilize its economy was to pray harder. Prayer, after all, is cheaper than expert consultants.”

**Outcome:**

The first fiscal year ends. California’s GDP surpasses Utah’s in exactly 21 days, 7 days FASTER than before the 8-1 SCOTUS decision unanimously upholding Utah's state/church merger!

The Utah legislature blinks in confusion, then calls for more fasting and a special testimony meeting on corporate synergy.

**Letter from California to Utah (Decade 0, Year 1):**

>

*“Dear Utah,*

>

*Congrats on your new… arrangement. We just wanted to let you know that we’ve already zoomed past your GDP in just 21 days, 7 days faster than we* have *historically. Maybe lay off the green Jell-O futures and invest in something more… tangibly productive?*

>*Happy January 28 with love.*

>

*Yours sincerely,*  
*California”*

Utah responds by calling for a day of sackcloth and ashes—metaphorically, of course, because real sackcloth is scratchy and violates newly passed comfort-modesty codes.

# Act II: A Decade Later – 21 Theocratic Days

**Time Jump:** It’s a decade later.

Gray lines adorn the faces of older legislators who’ve cycled through countless “spiritual audits.”

**Scene:** A Support Group for Economically Recovering Theocracies (ERTh), a hidden conference room in the Church-Capitol basement. Some people are beginning to wonder if Utah is on the right path. Utah’s representatives sit in a circle, discussing their plans to wean Utahns' off their “religious addiction.”

But the state and church of Utah isn't having any of it. They’ve decided they will try everything and never admit they are ever wrong: They introduce pro-sabbath industrial regulations. Mandatory “family home evening” for corporations every Monday.  State/church funding for scripture-themed start-ups ...but the economics are bleak and nothing is helping.

Meanwhile, California now surpasses Utah’s GDP in just 14 days.

The countdown clock reappears with a dramatic “28” in bold neon - the pre-state/church merger becomes Utah's new goal to make Utah Great Again.

**Letter from California (Decade 1):**

>*“Dear Utah,*

>

*14 days. We didn’t even have time to check our solar farms before passing you up this year. Is your state motto now ‘Pray Harder’? Because the markets aren’t responding well to that. Consider diversifying—maybe not every startup needs a mission companion?*

>

*Fondly,*  
*California”*

Utah officials vow to “overcome the sinful lure of economic stagnation” through mandatory scripture memorization for CEOs.

# Act III: Two Decades Later – 14 Theocratic Days

**Time Jump:** Another decade.

The entire generation of initial merger architects has retired—some say fled—to less devout economies.

The younger generation tries to blend faith with entrepreneurial spirit, but the environment is stifling. Every pitch meeting starts with a testimony and ends with a “faith forecast” rather than a profit/loss statement.

Utah’s big innovation: HolyCoin—“the world’s first spiritually-backed cryptocurrency.”

Unfortunately, it doesn’t scale well outside the state’s faithful base and crashes spectacularly when the blockchain “Fasts of Faith” halt transactions every Sunday.

**Letter from California (Next Decade):**

>

*“Dear Utah,*

>

*7 days this time. We thought about giving you a head start, but hey, learn to keep up. We had rent control negotiations, Hollywood and longshoremen union strikes to settle and we still beat your GDP in far less than a month, our historic time it took to leave you in the dust.  Have you considered exporting your Tabernacle Choir as a subscription service? We’d pay for a 24/7 lo-fi hymns channel.*

>

*Warm regards,*  
*California”*

Utah’s response? They introduce spiritual capital gains forgiveness—if you testify before the Economic Quorum about your belief in the ROI of righteousness.

# Act IV: Three Decades Later – 7 Theocratic Days

**Time Jump:** Another decade passes.

The world has changed, but Utah remains devout and struggling.

Holographic mission ads appear on street corners. Entrepreneurs pitch “Golden Plates VR experiences.” California surpasses their annual GDP in only 3 days now.

**Letter from California (Decade 3):**

>

*“Dear Utah,*

>

*Wow, 3 days. We basically took a long weekend, sipped organic wine, did hot yoga on the beach, and whoosh—past your GDP by Monday. Congratulations, we pass your G.D.P. in less time than we pass Wyoming (4 days) and Vermont (5). Maybe it’s time to detox from the religious overreach and embrace a balanced budget that doesn’t rely on answered prayers. Don't feel bad.* After all\*, you'll understand and agree a lot CAN be done in three days. Wink Wink. Just saying.\*

>

*Namaste,*  
*California”*

Back in Utah, the leaders finally hold a closed-door meeting.

The “Church & State Unified Council” tearfully admits their theocracy might not be the economic engine they imagined. They even whisper the unthinkable: Maybe separate some fiscal policies from theological mandates?

# Act V: Reflection and the Road to Recovery

Utah’s legislators, now wizened and exhausted, weigh the option of entering “Religious recovery.” They bring in a low-key consultant from Nevada (neutral ground) who suggests a radical step: “Try treating your economy like, you know, an economy. Add a dash of secular policy, don't just ban books, balance them, and rely less on divine intervention.”

**Narration:**

“After decades of denial, Utah stands at a crossroads. Utahns organize to confront their state's religious addiction. Only this time, the addiction isn’t to caffeinated beverages or coffee—it’s to religion as a cure-all.”

The episode ends with Utah’s leaders timidly drafting their first post-theocracy economic bill, tentatively separating spiritual doctrine from trade agreements reimplementing commerce and outlawing tariffs against less religious state.

The countdown clock for next year’s GDP comparison looms in the background, threatening to drop to zero days eventually, should Utah fail to adapt.

**Final Fade-Out:**  
The camera pans over Utah’s Capitol building, still adorned with church iconography, but the lights inside flicker as if something new—something sober and more rational—is about to emerge. Over the end credits, “'in the house in a heartbeat' from 28 days soundtrack

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rfTdF6W7KA&list=PL9BIRiZvlKSQ2nmeTc4dlH\_f9GqurqUXy&index=19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rfTdF6W7KA&list=PL9BIRiZvlKSQ2nmeTc4dlH_f9GqurqUXy&index=19) plays softly, reminding us that even in struggle, there might be grace and gratitude on the road to recovery.

**Tone and Takeaways:**  
In this comedic yet darkly insightful installment of *Black Mirror Mormonism*, the theocratic state of Utah grapples with its economic stagnation like an addict in rehab.

The humorous letters from California serve as both a narrative device and a comedic highlight, marking each decade’s humiliating milestone.

Utah must admit it has a problem before it can begin to heal. The countdown clock and recurring letters underscore the theme of repeated disappointment and the urgent need for change.

By the end, the audience is left contemplating whether Utah can permanently break its addiction to a religious theocratic system and embrace the messy, secular reality of economic self-reliance—and whether it will ever again take California, 28 days.

OUTRO FACTS:

Assuming California's GDP is evenly distributed across the year, and, California's GDP is approximately $3.23 trillion annually (it is actually higher), this equates to about $8.85 billion per day ($3.23 trillion / 365 days). So:

* By January 5, California has already matched Wyoming's entire annual GDP.
* 5 days later by January 9th, California has matched BOTH Wyoming and Vermont.
* Alaska's GDP is overtaken next by January 16.
* Then, North Dakota by January 24, and South Dakota by January 30.

It would take approximately 28 days for California to achieve Utah's annual GDP, or, 31 to duplicate Alabama.

In six months, California would easily generate enough GDP to surpass the combined GDP of the 15 smallest states. THE END",1,1733874961.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

just some highlights to give you an idea: 
- from the get go, roommate #1 would leave their dishes in the sink for days and days and would only do them when someone asked. sometimes it would take a couple of asks before they finally got done. 
- caught roommate #1 mopping BEFORE sweeping and when they started mopping and i tried to nudge them in the right direction by telling them to sweep first, they said that “they know that” and then proceeded to clean in backwards order (which made the floors worse). they also constantly put dishes in random/wrong places and i told them where the bowls go and they again said that “they know that” but then proceeded to put them in the wrong cabinet????? 
- would consistently have to remind roommates #1 and #2 to do their ONE (1) chore for the week. of course the one week i didn’t do that they didn’t do their jobs. then roommate #2 cussed me out OVER TEXT when roommate #1 overheard me talking to our other roommate about how i was frustrated and don’t know what else to do bc it’s not my job to remind people. very classy. 
- roommate #1 fills up our water filter with only enough water to fill up their water bottle??? have witnessed this several times 
- roommate #1 got paint all over roommate #3’s coffee table and didn’t clean it until roommate #3 sent a text asking where it came from. did they apologize or respond at all? nope! 
- roommate #1 left a BAG OF TRASH outside in the hallway for a week and only took it out because i told them to because it was quite literally swarming with gnats…

i don’t know what more i can do. i have tried to communicate, i have tried to work with them to implement a chore system, and nothing is working. 

i’m not trying to make myself seem like a perfect roommate or anything, i have my faults as well, but my god i didn’t know people could be SO inconsiderate and immature. i feel like i am going insane and i don’t know how much longer i can stand it.

I cook food most nights unless he was his steak then it’s all him and on weekends if we’re together then he’ll make breakfast. I do all the cleaning in the house… he will only clean something if I tell him to do it or ask for help when cleaning and I literally have to break down what he needs to clean otherwise he’ll just clean the one thing and leave everything else to me.. example… I asked him to dust and clean the coffee table and anything else around that needs to be cleaned. We’re in an apartment and I have 2 cats with bright wood floors.. you can very clearly see any crumbs, litter, trash etc ok the floor and cat toys scattered around as well as the sofa cover all messed up and shoes scattered everywhere in the entrance vs them being on the shoe rack but he only cleaned the coffee table and when I asked about cleaning other stuff he said it wasn’t messy… so I explained. This has happened a few times and I’ve told him I need him to just clean up on his own without me telling him to do it or waiting on me. Same with food. As for finances… he’s had to pay me his half of the rent later due to him not having money at the time it’s due. He’ll spend money on his hobbies and no problem on getting wine or whiskey but some how when I tell him to stop by the grocery store to get some lettuce or other ingredients for dinner or whatever smaller ask… he’ll tell me he doesn’t have the money at the moment for it. Sometimes it feels like he’s not serious enough when he needs to be too and don’t get me wrong I’m a goof and adventurous and will mess around but I also know how to read a room and stuff… now all of this is not an everyday thing like it’s not happening every time! But enough to where I’ve become concerned and don’t know how to talk to him about this anymore. He always pays me back and I don’t even have to remind him. I’ve tried to talk about all this with him in the past and we’ve been together almost 2 years now and he really is so supportive, sweet, loving and attentive. I just also want to feel like he’ll be reliable if I were ever to ask him to cover me or make a smart decision for us etc. I hate that I’m comparing this to a mom feeling but it’s really the most relatable and I don’t know how else to talk to him in a way where he won’t get offended or whatever.

Day 1: I had some stinging/soreness when I sat down, and soreness in my hip.

Day 2: When I was taking a shower I noticed the soreness again. I got a mirror and looked, and I had a rash on my bottom. I have never had something like that before so I called my OBGYN (because of location, I preferred her) and she diagnosed Shingles. I immediately started Valacyclovir 1,000mg (ultimately I am going to be taking it for 10 days but common duration is 7 days). I am feeling very tired. Taking NyQuil so I can sleep through the pain.

Day 3: The rash started forming small blisters in some areas. I noticed a couple new spots of rash on my leg (same side as the rash on my bottom. My leg (the one with the rash) started tingling like when it first wakes up from falling asleep and aching. I am still tired a lot and it hurts to walk. Still taking NyQuil. Doc says I can alternate higher dosages of Tylenol and Ibuprofen but I don't want to take all those pills so I am just sticking with NyQuil twice a day. Read that you are only supposed to eat a clean diet of basically vegetables, some fruits and whole grains (but not whole grain bread). I read to especially not eat sugar. You can search up the reasons for this. Basically, it aggravates the Shingles if you eat all the other stuff. No coffee either (tear).

Day 4: The rash is stinging now and I am still having pain in my leg. I put a little vaseline on the rash and have been staying in bed. Tired. Ordered Lysine, Maluka Honey (to put on the spots because a nurse recommended it) and medical boy shorts (gauze like shorts to put on over the rash with honey on it). So far no itching. Foot feels swollen and hurts when I walk. Decided to buy some edibles with 5mg THC and 5mg CBD. Tried one, it knocked me for a loop. Didn't like that.

Day 5 (today): Staying in bed, leg aches and had nerve pain all night. Woke up and took HALF an edible. That was ok. Still hurts to walk. Rash still burns. So far the rash seems dried up but is still there.

Hoping the rash starts to disappear in the next couple of days. I heard it is 7-10 days for spots to heal once they appear. 

In summary - I caught mine early. The antiviral med seemed to work by the end of the second day I was taking it. The rash did not spread after the second day of meds. NyQuil seems to work well at night for me. I am just suffering through the nerve pain because it is bearable but my doctor did offer to call in Gabapentin if it got too painful. Keeping Vaseline on the wound in a light amount once a day did seem to help with the burning/dry feeling. I did this after there were no blisters I could see. I am hoping the honey will be even better. Probably won't use the edibles much/if at all. I just don't like the high feeling.",1,1733874190.0,shingles,0,1.0,False

- 1 350kw/year fridge/freezer, 24 hours per day.

- 1 coffee maker, 30 minutes per day
- 1 55"" tv (Samsung, 2024, lcd display I think), 4 hours per day.
- 1 200kw/year washing machine, 3 loads per week (30-75 minutes each).
- 1 bathroom fan, 2 hours per day.

I'm sorry I don't have watt/hour or year for all appliances. 

FYI - watts and hours of usage for everything above is more than it really is, I'd just prefer to overcompensate and have a surplus in energy output rather than a deficit.

According to the power company, I use between 90-120kw per month. 

I've calculated how many panels/batteries I need before, but when I look into the English language content out there that caters to North American and European consumers that use much more energy than I, I second guess myself even though the math is all straightforward. I would greatly appreciate a second opinion to put my doubts to rest.

About a month ago, I (29) met a girl (25) who I ended up really liking. We've been on 3 dates - coffee, dinner, and drinks. The last two, we ended up back at her place and hanging out for a long time. All went great. The last time we hung out, I told her I liked her, which she turned away and smiled at, and we kept making out for another hour after. We had made plans to hang out a couple weeks later (I was going out of town). Texted a couple days after with lots of smiley faces, you know the deal.

A few days later, when I went out of town, with no explanation, she seemed to pull back. This obviously gave me some anxiety, waiting around on her texts and wondering why the vibe suddenly switched. Tried to stay patient, but I couldn't handle it for more than 2 days (we text a good bit).

She sent me a message saying she didn't see it going anywhere, which obviously hurt, but I accepted. I reached out around a week later (a few days ago), asking to try and reconnect, which she eventually agreed to. I realized I had been moving too fast and promised to slow down.

So now, here we are. We had our first conversation last night, around 5 messages that were all pretty long (5-8 lines or so), just talking about our day and stuff. She ended up leaving me on read (not really, no read receipts), and I assume she'll text me tonight after work.

Would really appreciate some advice on how to move forward. I really like this girl, she has told me she really likes me and spending time with me, but I'm just very anxious/nervous in this stage right now. And I'm not 100% sure how to approach this new dynamic of our relationship.

Anywho, the asshole who had just finished berating my employee looked like he’d seen a ghost. I glanced up at Ivan, who stared at the man with an intensity that I’ve rarely seen from anyone, let alone a seven-foot-tall behemoth like him. I almost felt sorry for the guy - until I remembered what he’d done, and any pity that I might have had for him flushed itself down the shitter. 

“Please, mister. I didn’t mean it, okay? I… I’m sorry. Is that what you want to hear?” 

Ivan’s tree trunk arm shot out, and he grabbed the man by the scruff of the neck. The guy’s latte fell to the floor, dousing the tile in coffee. I sighed at the mess, but I didn’t move a muscle. This was too good to miss. 

“Tell sorry to Robby, idiot,” Ivan spat in a heavy Russian accent. 

“S-sorry,” he stammered. I couldn’t stop myself from grinning. 

“It’s okay, sir! I know you didn’t mean it!” Robby beamed, a faux smile plastered across his lips. 

Ivan then dragged his victim to the door, shoved it open, and violently tossed him to the pavement, giving him a parting message as he did. “You are banished. Leave my sight.” I watched, trying not to laugh, as the man scampered away. 

“Ha! That was incredible! You really scared the piss out of him, Ivan.” I turned to find Frank, our regular ex-biker, chuckling as he sipped his espresso.  

“Yes. He will not have piss to give.” 

Frank and I locked eyes, our brows furrowed. “Uh… what?” I said, still trying to comprehend what Ivan was even going for with that statement.

“He will not be pissing anymore.”

Nope. Still nothing. 

“Ivan, I don’t think that means what you think it does. Anyway, I’ll get this cleaned up. Thanks for sticking up for me, big guy,” I said, retrieving the mop bucket from behind the counter. 

“You are welcome, Calla. Now, I have report to file,” he replied, stomping to the back office.  

“Good luck with that,” Frank chimed in, eyeing the mess, “The guy left a little bit more than just a spilled latte.” My heart dropped into my stomach. Frank was right. 

A thin trail of dirt and insects led to the door from where the man had been standing. A wide array of different bugs writhed on the ground, crawling in every direction. A knot twisted itself into my gut. 

“Great. Hopefully this won’t escalate into anything serious. You remember what happened the last time some freak put me in her crosshairs.” 

“Yeah, Nona had to get involved. Voodoo is no joke,” Frank said, nodding to the entity with a brown fedora and yellowed newspaper sitting at the back of the shop. I glanced in his direction, pursing my lips. 

Nona (short for no name) isn’t human. The only thing we know about him is that he’s powerful - and he’s on our side. He’s like Aftermath’s own personal guardian angel. If he has to step in, that means shit has hit the fan.

“Hopefully it’s not one of *those* situations,” I replied, the unease settling in my stomach, “But I have a feeling that we haven’t seen the last of our new friend yet.”

\*\*\*

Three days went by with no incidents. Well, none aside from Frank slipping on a napkin and busting his ass on the floor. (You can bet your bottom dollar that I’ll be holding that over his head for the rest of his existence.) But on the fourth day, something… strange happened. 

“Excuse me, *miss*. You have a lot of nerve serving me this - this *abomination.* I demand a full refund and a sincere apology.” 

Pure, unabated rage bubbled within me. Mrs. Abbot had always been one of our more difficult customers. She looks like Corpse Bride, but demands to be wined and dined like Cinderella, which has always infuriated me. I was about to give her a piece of my mind, when I glanced down at the drink she had in her hand. 

There were earthworms in it. 

Not just one, either. I counted at least eight of the slimy things writhing around in Mrs. Abbot’s coffee. My heart dropped, and that feeling of intense unease returned. 

“I am *so* sorry about this, Mrs. Abbot. I have no idea how this happened. I’ll give you a full refund and a coupon for a week’s worth of free drinks, on the house.” 

She gave me the once-over, her judgemental stare scanning me up and down like I was scum on the bottom of her glass slipper. “I suppose that would be sufficient. But if it happens again, you *will* have a lawsuit on your hands, I promise you that.” 

“Yes ma’am, understood,” I replied, mentally rolling my eyes as I went to prepare her a new dewormed drink. She was talking out her ass. The dead have no judicial system. Still, though, the issue was cause for concern. 

“Hey Robby?” I said, approaching him with the disturbing concoction after delivering the new espresso to Princess Pretentious. 

“Yeah? What’s up, Miss Calla?” 

“I’m not getting pissed at you or anything, but I want you to take a look at this.” 

Robby hobbled up to me, leaning heavily on his crutch. He’s only got one leg, and on top of that, he’s a genuinely good kid, so I’ve always had a soft spot for him. But some things are inexcusable. 

Robby leaned in, his eyes growing wide as saucers when he caught sight of the worms. “Any idea how this could have happened?” 

“No! I swear, I would never do anything like that on purpose. M-maybe someone put them in after I made the drink? I don’t know, Miss Calla, you have to believe me!” I could hear the quiver in his voice as he spoke. My heart broke for him. I hated having to grill him like that, but I needed answers. 

“I’m sorry, Robby. I wasn’t trying to accuse you of anything. I know you wouldn’t do that. I just need to figure this out so it doesn’t happen again.” 

I could see the relief wash over his face when I told him that. Another pang of guilt struck me like a lightning bolt. It was clear that he really cared about his job. 

“I’m going to look around. Just let me know if you see any more creepy crawlies, okay?” I said, surveying the area. Robby flashed me a thumbs-up as I stalked over to the empty cups. And that’s when I saw them. 

They were there, clear as day. The cups by the espresso machine weren’t empty like they should have been. Worms had been placed at the bottom of each cup in the stack, wriggling in clusters at the bottom of their plastic prisons. I suddenly had a clear picture of what had happened. 

If someone wasn’t paying close attention, it would be fairly easy to zone out and bury the things under a chunk of ice while preparing the order. That must have been what Robby did - He always was a daydreamer. But that still left one question. 

Who put the worms in our empty cups? I had a sinking feeling that I already knew the answer. 

Things only got worse from there. We began finding more and more insects around the shop, to the point where Ivan called an exterminator - and that’s saying something, because he’s a real cheapskate. 

Even then, the bugs just kept coming - centipedes crawling from the sink, roaches scuttling across the floor, the occasional wasp finding its way into Ivan’s office. It was getting unbearable. 

And then, a week after the original incident, something happened - just like I knew it would. I was preparing Frank’s regular blonde espresso, when I felt a presence at the counter. Something sinister that made my skin crawl, yet seemed oddly familiar at the same time. I glanced up, dreading what I would find. 

Nona stood before me, his fedora tipped downward to hide his face. His newspaper was neatly tucked beneath his arm, and a gloved hand rested on the countertop. I’d interacted with him a handful of times before, but I still haven’t managed to get used to the menacing aura he radiates. 

“Wait. L-let me guess,” I said, trying to subdue the quiver in my voice, “something bad is coming?” 

Nona’s response left me stunned. Normally, the harbinger of doom would leave me with only a cryptic answer. One that warned of immense danger. But this time was different. 

“I’ll handle it.” 

I stood there, jaw nearly hitting the floor, as the entity returned to his seat and unfolded his newspaper like nothing had happened.

“Okaaay,” I said, turning to Robby, who wore an equally puzzled expression, “I guess we’ll leave it up to him.” 

\*\*\*

The real fun didn’t start until the next day. I was fairly certain that nothing crazy would go down. Nona hadn’t come in yet, so, being the all-knowing (I think?) being that he is, I just assumed that we were safe. But I was dead wrong. 

It began with a house fly. 

Just one, lazily buzzing around the counter. I sighed, thinking that it was just a straggler. I watched as it flew around the near-empty shop, eventually landing on Frank’s table. He swatted at it, but missed, smacking the tabletop with a loud *thud.* 

“Calla, are you sure that Ivan really called an exterminator? Awfully coincidental that he had to go away on ‘business’ right after the problem arose, don’t ya think?” 

“Believe me, I know how it looks, but I was here when the dude stopped by. Ivan *still* hasn’t shut up about how expensive it was. Just be glad that you don’t have to put up with his bitching.” 

“Heh. Small blessings, I guess,” Frank said, taking a sip from his espresso. 

“Small blessings indeed.” 

My attention shot to the door. I hadn’t even heard anyone come in, but the second that my eyes landed on the man in the entryway, my blood turned to ice. 

It was him. The bug man. I knew that I probably hadn’t seen the last of him, but he’d shown up when I’d least expected it. None of my guardian angels were there to defend the place - Ivan had left to manage another location a day prior. Nona was off doing God-knows-what. Hell, I didn’t have Robby there to thwack the guy with his crutch a few good times. It was just me and Frank - And I knew damn well that Frank wasn’t going to do jack shit. 

“As I was saying,” the creep continued, reveling in the stupor scrawled across my visage, “It really is a blessing that I picked today to pay you a visit. Being that the shop is so empty and all.” 

The room fell silent as I tried to think of a way out of our predicament - but in that moment, the only thing I could focus on were the insects surrounding our unwanted guest in all directions. 

“Wh-what are you?” Frank stammered. 

I rolled my eyes. You should never ask these things what they are, even as one of the dead. Frank knew that. It just gives them an excuse to brag about themselves before they tear you limb from limb. 

“What am *I*?” the man replied, feigning shock. “If you must know, my name is Khepri, lord of the insects! I am the one responsible for your little pest problem as of late, but I presume that you had already gathered as much.”

He glanced between Frank and me, gauging our expressions. He must have determined that we weren’t terrified enough, because he lifted his hands, and the creepy crawlies surrounding him surged into the shop. My eyes grew wide as dinner plates. We were in hot water. 

Spiders and mantises and beetles piled over the counter, trampling each other in their haste. I backed away, looking behind me. No luck. There were even more of the little monstrosities blocking my exit. I was trapped. 

My heart thundered in my chest as Khepri approached me. Hundreds of tiny bodies tumbled off of him with each miniscule movement. I was paralyzed, too afraid to move. Frank’s eyes locked with mine, pleading for help. He wasn’t faring much better. He was standing on a coffee table, cornered by the sea of insects. 

“Come on, Nona. What the hell is taking so long?” I grumbled, futilely swiping away at the small army crawling up my leg. 

“You really shouldn’t have crossed me, girl. It’s unfortunate that your superior is absent. Your transgressions will cost you dearly.” 

I was beginning to think that he was right. I didn’t know where Nona was or what he was doing, but I realized that there was a possibility that he wasn’t going to show up. 

“Now then, are you familiar with this creature?” Khepri asked, opening his hand to reveal a pitch-black spider. It reared back, baring a pair of sharp, pointed fangs. My heart plummeted, and I knew then that I was in real danger. 

“In case you weren’t aware, this is the Sydney Funnel Web. It is one of the most venomous arachnids on the planet, with the ability to end a human’s life in a mere fifteen minutes. But don’t take my word for it. You’re going to find out firsthand.” 

My mind raced, and my legs felt like they were made of lead, but I knew what I had to do. I turned, prepared to flatten any bug that dared to stand between me and the exit - but I couldn’t move. 

Thousands of legs scurried across my skin. The insects didn’t bite. They didn’t sting. But what they did do was *much* worse, considering the situation. 

The little creatures banded together to keep me rooted to the spot, effectively immobilizing me. My eyes grew wide as reality smacked me like a ton of bricks. I was going to die. 

“You really thought you could escape so easily? Ha. Puny human. To me, you are nothing more than an insect. A vile worm that needs to be squashed. And I am about to do just that.” 

Khepri grinned maniacally as he brought the spider closer to my neck. I struggled to fight against my constraints, but it was no use. I didn’t even manage to dislodge a single ant. This was it. I shut my eyes, fully expecting to feel twin fangs piercing my neck at any moment. 

But to my relief, they never did. 

Nona had seemingly materialized out of nowhere behind Khepri. His gloved hand snatched the spider away and I think he… ate it. All I know is that I heard a muffled crunch, and the Sydney Funnel Web was gone. 

“No. No, y-you’re not supposed to be here. I summoned you into my trap. This can’t be happening.” All the color had drained from Khepri’s face, and he looked as if he wanted to pass out. I didn’t blame him. In that moment, the aura that Nona radiated was downright malevolent. He clearly wasn’t happy about being tricked. 

“Look now, I’m certain that we can negotiate some kind of deal. Surely there’s something you must want,” Khepri probed, shrinking back into the counter. 

Nona didn’t respond. He just pointed behind me, his signature fedora still concealing his face. I took that as my cue to look away - And the moment I did, the screams began. 

Guttural shrieks of agony erupted throughout the shop, echoing off the walls. I winced at the sound of bones snapping and the wet squelch of entrails slapping the floor. After a tense moment, the insects holding me prisoner all dropped dead, releasing me from their hold.  

Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of tiny bodies lay scattered in heaps throughout the shop. I chanced a look at Frank, knowing that my savior was out of sight behind the counter. He was absolutely mortified. His eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of their sockets at a moment’s notice, and he was huddled against the window, trembling. I didn’t blame him. He had a front row seat to the action. 

Suddenly, Nona rose to his feet, his job finished. There was no trace of Khepri, aside from a streak of blood on Nona’s fedora. 

“Uh, thanks for saving me, buddy. Maybe get here a litttttle earlier next time, if you can. I was about half a second away from joining these little buggers,” I said, as the adrenaline began to wear off. 

Nona simply flashed me a thumbs-up, then proceeded to consume handfuls of the tiny carcasses, shoveling them into his - face hole? Maw? Endless void? I dunno, *whatever* he’s hiding under there. I was grateful for his help. I was going to need it. 

“Hey Calla, um… I’m gonna go home now,” Frank said, interrupting my train of thought. He was already beginning to climb over the booth on his mission to avoid stepping into the sea of dead insects. 

“Okay, see ya Frank,” I replied, giggling as I watched him clamor over a table. “I’m going to close the shop for the day anyway. Nona and I have a *lot* of cleaning to do.”

About a month ago, I met a girl who I ended up really liking. We've been on 3 dates - coffee, dinner, and drinks. The last two, we ended up back at her place and hanging out for a long time. All went great. The last time we hung out, I told her I liked her, which she turned away and smiled at, and we kept making out for another hour after. We had made plans to hang out a couple weeks later (I was going out of town). Texted a couple days after with lots of smiley faces, you know the deal.

A few days later, when I went out of town, with no explanation, she seemed to pull back. This obviously gave me some anxiety, waiting around on her texts and wondering why the vibe suddenly switched. Tried to stay patient, but I couldn't handle it for more than 2 days (we text a good bit).

She sent me a message saying she didn't see it going anywhere, which obviously hurt, but I accepted. I reached out around a week later (a few days ago), asking to try and reconnect, which she eventually agreed to. I realized I had been moving too fast and promised to slow down.

So now, here we are. We had our first conversation last night, around 5 messages that were all pretty long (5-8 lines or so), just talking about our day and stuff. She ended up leaving me on read (not really, no read receipts), and I assume she'll text me tonight after work.

Would really appreciate some advice on how to move forward. I really like this girl, she has told me she really likes me and spending time with me, but I'm just very anxious/nervous in this stage right now.

Hi, 


I’m 34M from Britain (England). I’m open to meeting new people to hang out and socialise with, and making new friends. I am a caring, kind, honest, loyal, patient, and sociable person and it would be great to meet other people with the same qualities. It would be great to build close male friendships with other guys, where you can chat/call, and socialise in person. I am particularly keen to meet other guys from Britain, as it would be great to have a friend who is in same country geographically, and where you can chat and meet up in person  regularly where possible and do different social activities together, e.g going to gym/working out, playing sports together, going to socialise at pubs and restaurants etc, going out for coffee etc. 


If anyone is interested in chatting and looking for the same, please feel free to send me a message anytime. It would be great to hear from you, and connect.

1hbfngq,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hbfngq/why_did_she_break_up_with_me/,Why did she break up with me?,"Hi all,

I recently was broken up by a woman and I'd love to hear what the crowd thinks of this situation. IE was she a gold digger?

So I matched with a 35 year old (beautiful SWF with a nice body) on Match. She was born and raised in the Hamptons and has a public Instagram with photos of her in rich locales around the Hamptons, in front of yachts, in fancy restaurants, etc. She only went on on vacation internationally and never ate fast food. On our first date, she mentioned she wanted to have a yacht of her own someday. I told her that people with yachts have it for a reason, and its not to flaunt their wealth lol.

On my profile I had put I was single w/o kids.  But on the 4th date I told her I was actually separated and had 2 kids.  She was a bit taken aback but then accepted it.  I never lied to her and only had some representation on the app profile.  I have lived alone for a couple of years so to me I was single....

Anyway Initially, things were great with us. I took her out to dates around NYC and we had a great time. Being a gentleman, I always paid for all the dates. She was fairly worldly and carried herself with poise. We had a great time together for about a year. I always paid for dates, but she bought groceries, and coffee etc. Small stuff. Over time, it began to get to me a bit, I mean I dont mind paying for dates, but she never offered in all our time together. But I let it slide. She had told me that she still had college debt and her parents didnt go to college, and that she didnt think she could ever afford to buy a house... Even though she grew up in the Hamptons, she was poor, although she portrayed herself as not so much rich but definitely not poor. If you saw her instagram, you would think that she had a silver spoon in her mouth though!

What really got to me after 9 months or so, was that she was planning on going on a trip to Japan. I couldnt go with her because I had obligations during that time. But she planned it out and was going alone with out me. She booked all these fancy places, interesting tours, and lots of places to visit all across japan. We were living together when she planned it and it really got under my skin. I mean, she told me she was poor and had all this debt which is why I paid for everything but now I saw her planning such an expensive trip. It really bothered me.

Before, I left to go on a business trip, I had a talk with her. Asking why didn't she offer to pay for dinners etc together since she clearly was spending tons of money on her japan trip. I was wondering if she was a gold digger. I just wanted to have a conversation to let he know I didnt feel special since she didnt want to spend money on me. She brushed me off then she went on her trip to Japan.

When she returned she started to offer to pay for things which was great but she also started to act more indifferent toward me. She was upset at me for calling her a gold digger which I apologized and said it didnt come out the way I intended. Anyway, she continued to act indifferent to me and even yelled at me for some weird reason when we went out to a pizza place and I was ordering us slices of pizza.

So later that night at home, I had a talk with her about feeling like she treated me badly. At that point she said she didnt have feelings for me and didnt trust me anymore.  She said I lied on the app and couldnt trust me.   We broke up that day.  She knew about my true details pretty much since the beginning.

This was a few months ago and I'm still completely confused. Do you all think she dumped me because I called her a gold digger? I dont get it. I always treated her well and never cheated or disrespected her.

Love to hear everyones thoughts on this. Did she break up with me because I called her out as a Gold digger and she knew she couldnt take advantage of me anymore?

I know I have to move on but things we so special between us during our whole time together.  We were living together for half a year and I was thinking of marrying her.... I'm just shattered by this... I have tried to apologize for the app details and for the gold digger comment, but she was so cold to me and now blocked me on phone and social... Its so confusing.

Hi, just looking for people to relate with/any advice. I don’t have anyone else I can speak to about this. I’m recently sober (one month) and for the last 9 years I have been abusing a variety of substances until I got spiked recently.However, before that I was also sober curious and would go days being sober. I also often spent those days not speaking to anyone besides over a phone call. I have no social media (re-downloaded Reddit for this but been in this community for a few years and want to be more active here) and so I don’t keep in contact with people well either. And you guessed it, it’s really fucking lonely. 

Thing is, I prefer being by myself and I’ve been on holiday by myself multiple times, go to restaurants by myself, spend almost every day by myself etc. Reading is my favourite thing and that’s not a group activity. I think in many ways I have a fulfilling life and do all the tips suggested for ‘lonely’ people e.g. working in cafe’s alone, working out. People have always praised me for being independent. However, I think I’ve reached an extreme where it’s no longer healthy. 

I now live in a small town (mostly old people) where everything closes at 5. Somehow I see even less people and I am more anxious about work events or video calls than I was before. 

When I drink/do drugs, I can be the life of the party. Most of my previous friendships have entirely depended on drugs/alcohol.  But I’m at that stage now where it feels like I either commit to being a complete addict (as I have before), which feels safer somehow, or go sober. When I’m not sober, I can withstand sensory issues more and I’m way more extroverted. I don’t overthink as much. 
 
Another point (as I’m sure lots of people relate to on here) is I’ve got a high IQ and so besides the over thinking/being sober, I find it incredibly difficult to find people interesting or not superficial or predictable?? Not sure of a better way to put this. 

But I honestly don’t know where I go from here. Non-sober activities in my town do not include people my age. One of my (2) friends in my town is a homeless lady who I often have coffee with but she’s paranoid schizophrenic, and so our conversations are sometimes difficult. I want to join a running group but they often go for a pint after and also aren’t my age so it’s more difficult to relate to them. I’m joining an art class in January which I’m really excited for :) but that’s it. I just feel like sobriety is a trap in some ways.

Our *regional* manager is here for a visit, and I don’t think he heard you properly.” Ivan glowered down at the man, who looked as if he wanted to die right then and there. Well, die *again,* that is.

“Please, mister. I didn’t mean it, okay? I… I’m sorry. Is that what you want to hear?” 

Ivan’s tree trunk arm shot out, and he grabbed the man by the scruff of the neck. The guy’s latte fell to the floor, dousing the tile in coffee. I sighed at the mess, but I didn’t move a muscle. This was too good to miss. 

“Tell sorry to Robby, idiot,” Ivan spat in a heavy Russian accent. 

“S-sorry,” he stammered. I couldn’t stop myself from grinning. 

“It’s okay, sir! I know you didn’t mean it!” Robby beamed, a faux smile plastered across his lips. 

Ivan then dragged his victim to the door, shoved it open, and violently tossed him to the pavement, giving him a parting message as he did. “You are banished. Leave my sight.” I watched, trying not to laugh, as the man scampered away. 

“Ha! That was incredible! You really scared the piss out of him, Ivan.” I turned to find Frank, our regular ex-biker, chuckling as he sipped his espresso.  

“Yes. He will not have piss to give.” 

Frank and I locked eyes, our brows furrowed. “Uh… what?” I said, still trying to comprehend what Ivan was even going for with that statement.

“He will not be pissing anymore.”

Nope. Still nothing. 

“Ivan, I don’t think that means what you think it does. Anyway, I’ll get this cleaned up. Thanks for sticking up for me, big guy,” I said, retrieving the mop bucket from behind the counter. 

“You are welcome, Calla. Now, I have report to file,” he replied, stomping to the back office.  

“Good luck with that,” Frank chimed in, eyeing the mess, “The guy left a little bit more than just a spilled latte.” My heart dropped into my stomach. Frank was right. 

A thin trail of dirt and insects led to the door from where the man had been standing. A wide array of different bugs writhed on the ground, crawling in every direction. A knot twisted itself into my gut. 

“Great. Hopefully this won’t escalate into anything serious. You remember what happened the last time some freak put me in her crosshairs.” 

“Yeah, Nona had to get involved. Voodoo is no joke,” Frank said, nodding to the entity with a brown fedora and yellowed newspaper sitting at the back of the shop. I glanced in his direction, pursing my lips. 

Nona (short for no name) isn’t human. The only thing we know about him is that he’s powerful - and he’s on our side. He’s like Aftermath’s own personal guardian angel. If he has to step in, that means shit has hit the fan.

“Hopefully it’s not one of *those* situations,” I replied, the unease settling in my stomach, “But I have a feeling that we haven’t seen the last of our new friend yet.”

\*\*\*

Three days went by with no incidents. Well, none aside from Frank slipping on a napkin and busting his ass on the floor. (You can bet your bottom dollar that I’ll be holding that over his head for the rest of his existence.) But on the fourth day, something… strange happened. 

“Excuse me, *miss*. You have a lot of nerve serving me this - this *abomination.* I demand a full refund and a sincere apology.” 

Pure, unabated rage bubbled within me. Mrs. Abbot had always been one of our more difficult customers. She looks like Corpse Bride, but demands to be wined and dined like Cinderella, which has always infuriated me. I was about to give her a piece of my mind, when I glanced down at the drink she had in her hand. 

There were earthworms in it. 

Not just one, either. I counted at least eight of the slimy things writhing around in Mrs. Abbot’s coffee. My heart dropped, and that feeling of intense unease returned. 

“I am *so* sorry about this, Mrs. Abbot. I have no idea how this happened. I’ll give you a full refund and a coupon for a week’s worth of free drinks, on the house.” 

She gave me the once-over, her judgemental stare scanning me up and down like I was scum on the bottom of her glass slipper. “I suppose that would be sufficient. But if it happens again, you *will* have a lawsuit on your hands, I promise you that.” 

“Yes ma’am, understood,” I replied, mentally rolling my eyes as I went to prepare her a new dewormed drink. She was talking out her ass. The dead have no judicial system. Still, though, the issue was cause for concern. 

“Hey Robby?” I said, approaching him with the disturbing concoction after delivering the new espresso to Princess Pretentious. 

“Yeah? What’s up, Miss Calla?” 

“I’m not getting pissed at you or anything, but I want you to take a look at this.” 

Robby hobbled up to me, leaning heavily on his crutch. He’s only got one leg, and on top of that, he’s a genuinely good kid, so I’ve always had a soft spot for him. But some things are inexcusable. 

Robby leaned in, his eyes growing wide as saucers when he caught sight of the worms. “Any idea how this could have happened?” 

“No! I swear, I would never do anything like that on purpose. M-maybe someone put them in after I made the drink? I don’t know, Miss Calla, you have to believe me!” I could hear the quiver in his voice as he spoke. My heart broke for him. I hated having to grill him like that, but I needed answers. 

“I’m sorry, Robby. I wasn’t trying to accuse you of anything. I know you wouldn’t do that. I just need to figure this out so it doesn’t happen again.” 

I could see the relief wash over his face when I told him that. Another pang of guilt struck me like a lightning bolt. It was clear that he really cared about his job. 

“I’m going to look around. Just let me know if you see any more creepy crawlies, okay?” I said, surveying the area. Robby flashed me a thumbs-up as I stalked over to the empty cups. And that’s when I saw them. 

They were there, clear as day. The cups by the espresso machine weren’t empty like they should have been. Worms had been placed at the bottom of each cup in the stack, wriggling in clusters at the bottom of their plastic prisons. I suddenly had a clear picture of what had happened. 

If someone wasn’t paying close attention, it would be fairly easy to zone out and bury the things under a chunk of ice while preparing the order. That must have been what Robby did - He always was a daydreamer. But that still left one question. 

Who put the worms in our empty cups? I had a sinking feeling that I already knew the answer. 

Things only got worse from there. We began finding more and more insects around the shop, to the point where Ivan called an exterminator - and that’s saying something, because he’s a real cheapskate. 

Even then, the bugs just kept coming - centipedes crawling from the sink, roaches scuttling across the floor, the occasional wasp finding its way into Ivan’s office. It was getting unbearable. 

And then, a week after the original incident, something happened - just like I knew it would. I was preparing Frank’s regular blonde espresso, when I felt a presence at the counter. Something sinister that made my skin crawl, yet seemed oddly familiar at the same time. I glanced up, dreading what I would find. 

Nona stood before me, his fedora tipped downward to hide his face. His newspaper was neatly tucked beneath his arm, and a gloved hand rested on the countertop. I’d interacted with him a handful of times before, but I still haven’t managed to get used to the menacing aura he radiates. 

“Wait. L-let me guess,” I said, trying to subdue the quiver in my voice, “something bad is coming?” 

Nona’s response left me stunned. Normally, the harbinger of doom would leave me with only a cryptic answer. One that warned of immense danger. But this time was different. 

“I’ll handle it.” 

I stood there, jaw nearly hitting the floor, as the entity returned to his seat and unfolded his newspaper like nothing had happened.

“Okaaay,” I said, turning to Robby, who wore an equally puzzled expression, “I guess we’ll leave it up to him.” 

\*\*\*

The real fun didn’t start until the next day. I was fairly certain that nothing crazy would go down. Nona hadn’t come in yet, so, being the all-knowing (I think?) being that he is, I just assumed that we were safe. But I was dead wrong. 

It began with a house fly. 

Just one, lazily buzzing around the counter. I sighed, thinking that it was just a straggler. I watched as it flew around the near-empty shop, eventually landing on Frank’s table. He swatted at it, but missed, smacking the tabletop with a loud *thud.* 

“Calla, are you sure that Ivan really called an exterminator? Awfully coincidental that he had to go away on ‘business’ right after the problem arose, don’t ya think?” 

“Believe me, I know how it looks, but I was here when the dude stopped by. Ivan *still* hasn’t shut up about how expensive it was. Just be glad that you don’t have to put up with his bitching.” 

“Heh. Small blessings, I guess,” Frank said, taking a sip from his espresso. 

“Small blessings indeed.” 

My attention shot to the door. I hadn’t even heard anyone come in, but the second that my eyes landed on the man in the entryway, my blood turned to ice. 

It was him. The bug man. I knew that I probably hadn’t seen the last of him, but he’d shown up when I’d least expected it. None of my guardian angels were there to defend the place - Ivan had left to manage another location a day prior. Nona was off doing God-knows-what. Hell, I didn’t have Robby there to thwack the guy with his crutch a few good times. It was just me and Frank - And I knew damn well that Frank wasn’t going to do jack shit. 

“As I was saying,” the creep continued, reveling in the stupor scrawled across my visage, “It really is a blessing that I picked today to pay you a visit. Being that the shop is so empty and all.” 

The room fell silent as I tried to think of a way out of our predicament - but in that moment, the only thing I could focus on were the insects surrounding our unwanted guest in all directions. 

“Wh-what are you?” Frank stammered. 

I rolled my eyes. You should never ask these things what they are, even as one of the dead. Frank knew that. It just gives them an excuse to brag about themselves before they tear you limb from limb. 

“What am *I*?” the man replied, feigning shock. “If you must know, my name is Khepri, lord of the insects! I am the one responsible for your little pest problem as of late, but I presume that you had already gathered as much.”

He glanced between Frank and me, gauging our expressions. He must have determined that we weren’t terrified enough, because he lifted his hands, and the creepy crawlies surrounding him surged into the shop. My eyes grew wide as dinner plates. We were in hot water. 

Spiders and mantises and beetles piled over the counter, trampling each other in their haste. I backed away, looking behind me. No luck. There were even more of the little monstrosities blocking my exit. I was trapped. 

My heart thundered in my chest as Khepri approached me. Hundreds of tiny bodies tumbled off of him with each miniscule movement. I was paralyzed, too afraid to move. Frank’s eyes locked with mine, pleading for help. He wasn’t faring much better. He was standing on a coffee table, cornered by the sea of insects. 

“Come on, Nona. What the hell is taking so long?” I grumbled, futilely swiping away at the small army crawling up my leg. 

“You really shouldn’t have crossed me, girl. It’s unfortunate that your superior is absent. Your transgressions will cost you dearly.” 

I was beginning to think that he was right. I didn’t know where Nona was or what he was doing, but I realized that there was a possibility that he wasn’t going to show up. 

“Now then, are you familiar with this creature?” Khepri asked, opening his hand to reveal a pitch-black spider. It reared back, baring a pair of sharp, pointed fangs. My heart plummeted, and I knew then that I was in real danger. 

“In case you weren’t aware, this is the Sydney Funnel Web. It is one of the most venomous arachnids on the planet, with the ability to end a human’s life in a mere fifteen minutes. But don’t take my word for it. You’re going to find out firsthand.” 

My mind raced, and my legs felt like they were made of lead, but I knew what I had to do. I turned, prepared to flatten any bug that dared to stand between me and the exit - but I couldn’t move. 

Thousands of legs scurried across my skin. The insects didn’t bite. They didn’t sting. But what they did do was *much* worse, considering the situation. 

The little creatures banded together to keep me rooted to the spot, effectively immobilizing me. My eyes grew wide as reality smacked me like a ton of bricks. I was going to die. 

“You really thought you could escape so easily? Ha. Puny human. To me, you are nothing more than an insect. A vile worm that needs to be squashed. And I am about to do just that.” 

Khepri grinned maniacally as he brought the spider closer to my neck. I struggled to fight against my constraints, but it was no use. I didn’t even manage to dislodge a single ant. This was it. I shut my eyes, fully expecting to feel twin fangs piercing my neck at any moment. 

But to my relief, they never did. 

Nona had seemingly materialized out of nowhere behind Khepri. His gloved hand snatched the spider away and I think he… ate it. All I know is that I heard a muffled crunch, and the Sydney Funnel Web was gone. 

“No. No, y-you’re not supposed to be here. I summoned you into my trap. This can’t be happening.” All the color had drained from Khepri’s face, and he looked as if he wanted to pass out. I didn’t blame him. In that moment, the aura that Nona radiated was downright malevolent. He clearly wasn’t happy about being tricked. 

“Look now, I’m certain that we can negotiate some kind of deal. Surely there’s something you must want,” Khepri probed, shrinking back into the counter. 

Nona didn’t respond. He just pointed behind me, his signature fedora still concealing his face. I took that as my cue to look away - And the moment I did, the screams began. 

Guttural shrieks of agony erupted throughout the shop, echoing off the walls. I winced at the sound of bones snapping and the wet squelch of entrails slapping the floor. After a tense moment, the insects holding me prisoner all dropped dead, releasing me from their hold.  

Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of tiny bodies lay scattered in heaps throughout the shop. I chanced a look at Frank, knowing that my savior was out of sight behind the counter. He was absolutely mortified. His eyes looked as if they were going to pop out of their sockets at a moment’s notice, and he was huddled against the window, trembling. I didn’t blame him. He had a front row seat to the action. 

Suddenly, Nona rose to his feet, his job finished. There was no trace of Khepri, aside from a streak of blood on Nona’s fedora. 

“Uh, thanks for saving me, buddy. Maybe get here a litttttle earlier next time, if you can. I was about half a second away from joining these little buggers,” I said, as the adrenaline began to wear off. 

Nona simply flashed me a thumbs-up, then proceeded to consume handfuls of the tiny carcasses, shoveling them into his - face hole? Maw? Endless void? I dunno, *whatever* he’s hiding under there. I was grateful for his help. I was going to need it. 

“Hey Calla, um… I’m gonna go home now,” Frank said, interrupting my train of thought. He was already beginning to climb over the booth on his mission to avoid stepping into the sea of dead insects. 

“Okay, see ya Frank,” I replied, giggling as I watched him clamor over a table. “I’m going to close the shop for the day anyway. Nona and I have a *lot* of cleaning [to do.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/HorrorJunkie123/)

She got into one of the most prestigious programs last month, and then she had time to think about our relationship. She later told me that it wasn't what she wants.

As a person, I would describe myself as someone who is friendly, sociable, outgoing, and patient, whilst also being a caring and respectful person.  


In terms of my interests and hobbies, I enjoy playing sports (I regularly play badminton, squash and table tennis), workout at the gym and do cardio/weights; socialising and going out to pubs, clubs and restaurants, watching movies (my favourite film genre is horror films); listening to music (pop, R&B, rock, indie, classical etc); gaming (I like playing PlayStation).


I also like visiting museums; and travelling and sightseeing; learning new languages and cultures; cooking; going out for coffees etc; reading history and literature and non-fiction; and playing other games like snooker/pool and bowling etc.


Whilst I am very open and happy to make new friends from international countries and I am open to long distance friendships, it would equally be great to make new friends in the UK or Britain to meet up and hang out with in person also. Ideally looking to make friends in the 25-40 age range (mid-late 20s, 30s and 40s - or similar ages to me). 


In any case, if anyone shares the same or similar interests/hobbies to me, and feels like we may get on and would like to build a new friendship together, please feel free to message or DM me anytime. I would be very happy to connect and chat with you. 🙂

The last romantic relationship I had ended in 1998, and the last time I hung out with a friend was in 2005.

A lot of people feel like they'd go stir-crazy if they stayed home too long. I felt the same way, and it took me up to ten years to get used to a lifestyle of being mostly homebound, without the usual social interactions or outside activities. This long adjustment is because we're naturally social and active beings.

Only recently did I find out that my agoraphobia is rooted in PTSD. With this understanding, I can finally begin to heal. I'm now doing talk therapy and taking medication, but more importantly, I'm taking small steps every day to get out of my comfort zone, like visiting busy places or catching up with someone over coffee.

While my bigger goals are still out of reach, I plan to achieve them in the next two years.

1hbfdd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1hbfdd3/to_you/,"To you, ","To you,

I am writing this to you because it is admittedly much easier than actually ever telling you.

I'll come out with the obvious: I like you.

You caught my eye the first time i saw you in February. I couldn't keep my eyes off of you, because you were absolutely pretty.

You are very attractive but that would have quickly subsided, had you not been... well, you.

Your personality made me stay, in a sense. You were something that I hadn't encountered before, at just 19 years old.

I had spent a good deal of time with other boys but, at my age, finding boys with maturity was difficult. Your ability to be stable and calm was much more alluring than your brown eyes or dorky hair. 

You were quite the opposite of me, but I never minded that at all. It was in fact ironic that someone like me could take a liking to you, someone who could very well dislike me.

I spoke at levels that you would cringe at, I talked in spaces that you wouldn't care to fill, I smiled in times you would avert from, I saw light where you rarely ever searched. I was very much different, in so many ways.

But i also saw similarities.

In those times, I found myself looking at you and wondering if you were sad. Maybe that's why someone like you is so, so quiet. Maybe you went through some deep things as a child, but I never cared to wonder about details. I respected your privacy fully in that circumstance.

It just shocked me to see someone who wore your face... who could be so wordless. 

I imagined us coexisting in the mundane things of the world. Cup of coffee, on the couch, in your pajamas, the smell of your cologne, and the vibration of your laughter that rippled through your ribcage and onto my cheek.

I thought about that... and about visiting North Carolina with you. The waves, the wonky towns that no one knows and the trickle of a lively creek.

I thought about a little log cabin getaway... maybe some random town in Oregon, one we can't pronounce the name of without a few good tries.

I thought about a lot of normal things with you. I thought about random polaroid pictures, scattered with memories of us.

Isn't it so morbidly sweet that the human brain can grow such one-sided connection that it begins to create scenarios of fantasy with that other person?

It was a way of me imagining us... to see if those puzzle pieces fit, y'know. Make sure the crevices line up perfectly with the rounded shapes.

It never felt complete, though.

It's because I don't know you. I know the you that clocks in to work and goes throughout your shift, but I don't know the you at home.

I don't know the you that sits in front of a tv, or on your phone.

I don't.

And you don't know me.

So, that puzzle is unsolved, collecting dust somewhere and I know I come every now and then to give it another try.

It never works out, though, and I end up having to pack it into its box again.

You are a good person, from the supercut of you that I have had the chance to see. I like that about you.

You seem like... a man. The stereotype, but with a few tweaks that make you still so youthful... so, like me.

Maybe not all the way like me.

I'm quite different, I think. I like blue, the ocean, cats, the smell of pumpkin in fall and coconut in summer, the shimmer of the sunlight on the waves, tall palm trees, the chirping of a mourning dove.

I like a lot of the little things that you pass by in life, because it pauses you. It makes you take a step back and live, even if it's just for a second.

I won't address you by name, so you won't really ever know. Thought I'd randomly add that in here.

All of that to say, I like your little traits, the ones you let slip out through the day.

The weird little things you do, the retorts you keep tucked in your back pocket, your small expressions that say much more than you allow.

I am infatuated with you, and i'll jump the stone over the sand to risk saying that.

I've been coming into a recurring conflict, though. Since February, I had learned that you had a partner.

She's pretty, fun, popular... not me. I hate to be the one who carries the suitcase of comparison. 

She's very pretty.

I don't know her much, but I can imagine you love her quirky traits. I think you two look pleasant together, like a couple straight out of a classic movie.

I will not lie and say it does not pain me to see how the pieces of your puzzles fit each other's so well, but I am not envious of it. 

Not at all, actually.

I am happy for you, for her. You guys are good together, at least from the surface. You are young, as is she. Life is so long, filled with so much and it carries growth.

I can only hope that you and her have the opportunity to unconditionally love each other for as long as you can... a life time.

I can see the glow from your pictures together, the memories you have made.

They are almost identical to those that I imagined between you and me.

Life isn't always that set straight, is it?

Life comes with detours, disappointments that become beneficial and surprises.

I can hold my hand out and hope that someone jumps to the train to catch it... catch me.

Foolishly, I had wished that could've been your skin that rubbed desperately against mine as you clasped my hand.

But I am young, I will grow and live for as long as the universe deems me to. I will meet more people, see new things and enjoy them.

I will succeed in some areas and falter in others, just like I did as a kid. 

I can sit here and lie all I want but I hope one day we find each other, if this is what should happen.

If the universe, the gods or god happens to fit us together, I would like to go back up to the attic and try unpacking that puzzle again. I think i could find that missing piece, although I do not know if you have it. 

I'd like to say that the reason you have this pull on me is because it's supposed to happen.

And maybe it is, just not how I had originally envisioned it.

Maybe, I needed to meet you in order to grow in some way. I think liking you has made me realize some of my undeniable flaws, but also I think 19-26 is usually like that.

I have realized in this time of liking you that I should probably work on my abandonment issues, the way I hold my tone and the love I give to others.

I have a lot of flaws, but I can only hold my hands out and pray that I do not need to keep searching for my person.

I want someone to love me, to confront my flaws, to shake them off of me and love me for the cracks they leave behind.

I had hoped for a time that it could be you.

And I still do, unfortunately.

Liking you has made me feel guilty.

I feel guilty because it is not right. I know it is not. I know I need to turn away from you and avoid you.

But it's like you always find some way back into my life.

If i don't work with you, you end up passing by in your car or passing by my job.

Why does the universe do things like that? Couldn't you have passed by the other location?

I will admit, your oblivious intersections into my life do frustrate me.

I don't want your help or your kindness, because I want it. Isn't that confusing?

I want your help and all of your kindness.

I want you.

But it's not the time for that now, and it very well may never be.

I have a lot set up for me and like a child, you cloud me although it is not intentional.

If I had the chance to love you, I'd write to you these letters in their entirety. It would open the ribcage of my feelings and emotions, with you being the only person to see them.

I have written much about you before, but I always end up stupidly deleting them in a flurry of embarrassment.

Shame, it's what you give me.

Anger, too.

The worst traits, all magnified under your spectacle.

I hope you do not only know me by those actions.

I sometimes hope you don't know me at all.

I am scared of you, and it's what makes me like you. I am not scared for fear of danger or anything. I am scared of you liking me back, and ironically I do not want that as much as I convince myself I do.

The second you like me back, I will run away... it's what I do best.

I run.

I would ruin it... and I am so scared of that.

I don't want to do that.

But I would try my best to leave my battered running shoes at the door this time, if given the chance.

I think it's time for me to do that. There are countless times where I have run away from something because I was just too scared.

It is scary to open up yourself to someone and wait for them to accept you. 

To confess, to get undressed.

It's all scary for me.

I have ruined everything good for me.

I think another thing that ruins a lot of the relationships I have attempted to built is my emotional intelligence.

I may come off as the dumb, clumsy girl but I am a little less than that in the privacy of my own room.

When I am alone, I think... and it's always been attributed to me being so mature for my age.

But it's not that.

I guess, I am just more realistic at my age than other people tend to be and I am more in tune with my feelings.

I feel on a different level than the girls around me could ever begin to understand and that is what boys do not get.

Boys are young... they think about sex more than they care for the words that leave my mouth.

I could write them a letter detailed with an abundance of love... and it will mean little to nothing. They wouldn't feel it, like I do. 

They wouldn't let it leave a sweet taste in their mouth.

It would be just a simple piece of paper with straggled writings of delusions. And I fear that... giving my all to someone on a deeper level than they could understand.

It's been a big conflict of mine.

I am scared that you would be like that to me... but your tone and your attitude hint at me otherwise.

I think it's why I was so caught by you.

I envision a sort of fantasy-like world where we had met each other a couple years ago... and everything would have been different.

i think that this letter has become too long, too much explanation, so I will be ending it here.

I am sorry that I have written to you, even if you will never receive this.

But most of all, I am sincerely sorry that I liked you... I, too, wish I could have shaken the thought of you back in February.

1hbfb28,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1hbfb28/avoiding_additives_and_fibrous_foods_is_the_best/,Avoiding additives and fibrous foods is the best decision I've made,"With lots of experimentation I've realized that one of the most important steps in becoming healthy is to avoid emulsifiers, fibrous foods and too acidic or too alkaline foods.

It's important to note that cheese additives, coffee, tap water and even in some chocolates can create constipation and pain for me.

For example, I get constipated if I drink coffee from the machine at work. If I make it with tap water at home(I live in Netherlands and they say it's even better than bottled) I also have issues, but not with bottled.

I have to make sure:
- to overboil potatoes and rice for the degradation of starch particles that can irritate the gut 
- to not eat more than 2 portions of starches a day
- to eat butter with every meal
- to avoid any form of grains (except white rice), fruits and veggies
- cook everything with bottled water
- avoid cheese with additives, so last and only option is Parmigiano Reggiano
- avoid coffee machines, chocolate and products that have ""aroma"" as additive
- avoid milk, yogurt or cottage cheese, since it contains water and calcium, it's alkaline, and more stomach acid needed to be produced, which sometimes leads to undigested food
- avoid drinking water with meals so I don't dilute stomach acid 
- sparkling water between meals helps since it's alkaline, after 1 hour I get a rebound of stomach acid
- avoid fresh Orange Juice since it's too acidic and stresses the gut lining stopping the bowel movement. It works well only if I take also a few grams of baking soda with it

Now I get a bowel or two a day, which is pretty good. I don't have pain, neither discomfort. I am not bloated.
Everything works 👍 


Edit:
I forgot to mention that the cause of my IBS is childhood stress that led me to years of diarrhea.
I want to congrat you for knowing that you have this issue since lots of people are not aware of it. They just take the pill and that's it.
I am in this country to work, and the walls are thin, which it's easy to hear through them. Sometimes I hear them in the toilet and both of my colleagues have chronic diahreea or at least some kind of. I asked them about it and they said they're completely healthy.

Has anyone here actually managed to stay friends with their LO? If so, how?","I've been crying for two days (including once in his presence), then I realised it's not over my LO specifically.

I'm almost 42. What I'm really crying about is **the loss of hope that I'd ever find someone** to love who'd actually love me back.

It's been years since my last failed failed attempt at romance. Then I met my LO at a local bar, and we bonded almost instantly. It's so rare for me to find someone I actually click with, who I can talk to all night about our favourite books and albums. 

And it's even more rare that I find someone like that who seems - at least in the beginning - to like me back, tells me I'm beautiful and smart. I told him things I never told anyone else. He told me his secrets too.

He'd say stuff like ""you're an attractive woman. I'd kiss you, but I don't want to start something I can't finish"". 

And he'd say, ""it's not a coincidence that I met you"", and then immediately take it back with ""I mean, I value our friendship"". I couldn't have imagined his flirting, it's not all in my head - most of our friends, neighbours and acquaintances who saw us sitting together assumed we're a couple.

In a way, I can't even fault him for rejecting me. He's done nothing wrong, on the contrary - he was always kind and affectionate.

Recently, he slowed down the rate of reply to most of my texts. I'm pretty sure he'd never view me as more than a platonic friend. **It's INSANELy difficult to be just friends with this person**. Last time I tried, we were having coffee together and **I just broke into tears randomly. I couldn't tell him why.** I don't think he knows.

I'm not getting any younger, and it feels like I'm running out of rope.

I wonder if this was the last time I'd ever open up like this. I try seeing other people, but it's completely pointless while I have these feelings for my LO. It's very hard to go no-contact without changing my lifestyle drastically, he's in my immediate environment. We're probably \~600-1000 meters away from one another every day of our lives.

And if I did succeed in no-contact somehow, I'd lose a friend that I actually enjoyed spending time with. And I'd still be lonely and unloved.",13,1733872669.0,limerence,0,0.94,False

We scheduled this a week ago and I'd assumed it'd be just the two of us. I was excited because it's been a while since we've seen each other.

For context, I hate it when my friends bring other people (specifically people I've never met) to hangouts that were originally planned to be just us. Especially with no prior notice.  All my friends know this. Jess knows this.

We met up today and she brought this girl ""Jay"" (20?f) with no notice beforehand. I was under the impression that it would be the two of us, so you could imagine my surprise. I really tried to be friendly, but I was visibly annoyed that she didn't keep her word and brought this person that I didn't know when she implied she wouldn't. The conversation we had was awkward, obviously, because Jay and I didn't know each other. It was just awkward small talk, and I was really hoping I'd be able to tell jess about things going on in my life that I wouldn't tell someone I don't know. (edit to clarify: nothing serious or severe, just casual life updates you'd usually talk about when catching up with a friend) I was annoyed so I made up an excuse to leave early (something like I had to study) I told Jess we could hang out next week and left.

Jess got pissed and has blown up my phone with texts about how I'm rude and inconsiderate etc etc. I originally didn't think I was in the wrong but I'm having second thoughts and would like an objective opinion.

Am I in the wrong for getting mad at her over this?...

EDIT: seems there's mixed opinions haha. I appreciate all feedback regardless of judgment. I wanted to add this for clarification, sorry for not clarifying earlier  I wrote the original post in a rush.

1. When I said ""keep her word,"" I was referring to the first time I told her about this a few months back. She said she understood and that she wouldn't. To be fair, that was the first and last time I'd explicitly told her. I suppose it was on me for assuming she'd remember.
2. Jay is her friend from college. She has never spoken about Jay to me before this hangout. I would be more understanding if she brought a friend that she's talked about to me before, but afaik she's never mentioned Jay once so that's why I was kinda taken aback.
3. My issue is not meeting new people. If I wanted to meet new people I would go to a party or something where I'm supposed to meet new people. my issue is that I was under the impression it would be a one on one coffee date but she brought somebody without telling me before. I'm asking for judgment on my reaction to an unexpected person, not my stance on meeting people.",96,1733872628.0,AmItheAsshole,84,0.84,False

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

“Adrian, no!”

We’ve all been there. A big presentation looming, a deadline breathing down our neck, a family drama unfolding – and suddenly, we’re acutely aware of our own breath. It feels…off. Stale. Not exactly minty fresh. Could stress be the culprit behind that less-than-pleasant puff? It's a question that’s crossed many minds, and the answer, like most things related to our health, isn't exactly black and white. This deep dive will explore the fascinating connection between stress, anxiety, and halitosis (the fancy term for bad breath), unraveling the science behind this surprisingly common concern.

Does Stress Cause Bad Breath? Unveiling the Connection
------------------------------------------------------

Stress – that ever-present companion of modern life – can wreak havoc on our bodies in countless ways, from sleepless nights to upset stomachs. But can it really impact the freshness of our breath? Well, the relationship isn't direct, like stress magically turning your mouth into a dragon's lair. Instead, it’s a bit more nuanced, operating through several indirect pathways. Let's unpack them.

### Dry Mouth: Stress's Sneaky Accomplice

Think of saliva as your mouth's natural cleaning crew. It washes away food particles, neutralizes acids, and keeps things generally spick and span. But when we're stressed, our bodies often go into ""fight or flight"" mode. This triggers a cascade of hormonal changes, one of which is a decrease in saliva production. Voilà! A dry mouth, or xerostomia in doctor-speak, sets the stage for bad breath to flourish. Without saliva’s cleansing power, bacteria have a field day, feasting on leftover food and releasing those notorious volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) – the very same compounds that give bad breath its distinctive…aroma.

### Stress Eating and Bad Breath: A Vicious Cycle

Ever find yourself reaching for sugary snacks or comfort foods when you’re feeling the pressure? You’re not alone. Stress eating is a common coping mechanism, but unfortunately, it can exacerbate bad breath. Sugary treats and refined carbohydrates provide a feast for the bacteria in your mouth, leading to an increase in those pesky VSCs. It's a vicious cycle: stress leads to unhealthy eating, which in turn worsens breath, potentially increasing stress levels even more. Talk about a double whammy!

### Neglecting Oral Hygiene: A Stress-Induced Slip-Up

Let’s be honest: when we're swamped with deadlines and worries, sometimes things like brushing and flossing fall by the wayside. And while skipping a brushing or two might not seem like a big deal, it can definitely contribute to bad breath, especially when combined with the dry mouth often caused by stress. It's like forgetting to take out the trash – things are bound to get a little funky after a while.

Does Stress Cause Bad Breath? Exploring Other Factors
-----------------------------------------------------

While stress can undoubtedly contribute to bad breath, it's important to remember that it's not the only player in the game. Several other factors can influence your breath's freshness, and sometimes, what seems like stress-induced halitosis might have a completely different root cause.

1. **Underlying Medical Conditions:** Certain medical conditions, such as gum disease, sinus infections, and even diabetes, can manifest as bad breath. If you're experiencing persistent halitosis, even with good oral hygiene and stress management, it's crucial to consult a doctor or dentist to rule out any underlying medical issues.
2. **Medications:** Some medications can contribute to dry mouth, which, as we've established, can lead to bad breath. If you suspect your medication might be drying out your mouth, talk to your doctor. They might be able to suggest alternatives or strategies to manage the side effect.
3. **Certain Foods:** Garlic, onions, and coffee – oh my! These culinary delights, while delicious, can leave a lingering odor on your breath. This isn't necessarily related to stress, but it's essential to consider dietary factors when evaluating bad breath.

Does Stress Cause Bad Breath? Practical Tips for Fresher Breath
---------------------------------------------------------------

So, what can you do if you suspect stress is contributing to your bad breath woes? Don't fret! There are plenty of practical steps you can take to combat the issue and regain your minty-fresh confidence.

- **Hydration is Key:** Keep a water bottle handy and sip on it throughout the day. Staying hydrated combats dry mouth, helping to wash away those odor-causing bacteria. Think of it as giving your mouth’s cleaning crew the resources they need to do their job effectively.
- **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva production, mimicking the cleansing action of our natural saliva. Plus, the minty flavor can provide a temporary breath refresh.
- **Prioritize Oral Hygiene:** Even when you’re stressed to the max, make brushing and flossing a non-negotiable part of your routine. It’s a small but mighty step toward fresher breath. And don’t forget to clean your tongue! That’s where a lot of odor-causing bacteria like to hang out.
- **Manage Stress Levels:** Easier said than done, right? But incorporating stress-reducing activities into your daily routine, like yoga, meditation, or simply taking a few deep breaths, can make a world of difference, not just for your breath, but for your overall well-being, too.
- **Seek Professional Help:** If you’re struggling with chronic stress or anxiety, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or counselor can teach you coping mechanisms and strategies to manage stress effectively, which can have a positive ripple effect on various aspects of your health, including your breath.

The Takeaway: Stress and Breath - A Complex Relationship
--------------------------------------------------------

So, does stress cause bad breath? The short answer is: it can contribute to it, but it's rarely the sole culprit. Stress often exacerbates existing issues or creates conditions (like dry mouth) that allow bad breath to flourish. By understanding the connection between stress and oral health, we can make informed choices and take proactive steps to maintain fresh breath, even during challenging times. Remember, a healthy mouth is a reflection of a healthy body and mind. Addressing stress, along with practicing good oral hygiene, is a winning combination for a fresher, more confident you. Don’t let stress steal your sparkle – or your fresh breath!

We met during college through the same friend group but we both graduated last spring, so I'm back home working while she's doing a fifth year at school. I've asked her in the past if she saw us as more than friends, to which she said not really. But since graduation, I feel like we've gotten closer again even though we're so far from each other, and I cannot tell if she still views me as just a good friend or more. 

For some context on our friendship: we became close really quickly by having a few classes together. We began to spend a bunch of time together just us two, whether it was watching tv, grabbing coffee, getting lunch together, going to parties together, -- odds are if you saw me around campus, she was with me. Everyone just assumed we were dating and our own friends thought we eventually would. She was subtly flirty and touchy with me and I knew she really enjoyed spending time with me. Anyway, we continued getting closer over the course of a few months. She was instantly one of my best friends. But, I couldn't help myself and developed pretty strong feelings for her. I eventually built up the courage to ask her if she saw us as more, she said not really. I thought she did, her own friends even told me I should ask her out, so honestly I was confused bc I thought her own friends would know. Neither of us have been in a relationship before -- incase that helps with context too.

Anyway, we remained friends but weren't nearly as close for a good while. Our last semester at college (this past spring), we had a class together again and got a bit closer which was great because I missed having her as one of my closest friends. And I feel like we've gotten closer since graduating even though we're not near each other. We ft every few weeks for a few hours to catch up and she's been the one to suggest meeting up, which she never really does. And luckily she doesn't live far from me so when she visits home we can, and we actually did hang out a bit over a week ago since she was home for a few days. It was a great time and made me realize how much I missed her. She kept emphasizing how she missed me and how she'll be home again in a few weeks for break so we have to see each other more while she's home. Idk if I'm just reading into it too much but it's just unlike her to be the one to suggest hanging out and showing a real desire to do so, so now I'm wondering if she's maybe starting to see me as more than a friend? I love having her as one of my best friends and don't plan on pursuing more than that, especially since we're not in the same city anymore, but I'm just curious what she might be feeling.

The mod team has been discussing rules and their relevance to our community and subreddit. We're deleting the Covid-19 specific rule as it no longer pertains directly to our subreddit and ongoing daily life. Doesn't mean our stances have changed regarding misinformation and the ridiculous hot-takes that people bandy about in here, but it's become more of a nuisance than it's worth for now. Rule 2 governs most of what we care about anyhow, so if y'all are a bunch of jerks and want to name call you're still catching bans.

Also, we've been listening to your reports and commentary and are implementing a new rule for posts made by local businesses. I think a fair compromise is how we've written the new ""Rule 6"":

* It's ok to post information about a commercial offering, but don't just post it without interacting with people who have questions or comments, but keep it to once a month at most. Don't repeat the same exact post on a regular basis - give us new information. Bonus points if there's something that connects with redditors like a discount or something.

Namely, if you have a small business or offer an interesting service to the local community, you are free to post about it. The emphasis here should be on community engagement. If you offer a service and want to post about it, feel free to do so SO LONG AS YOU STICK AROUND AND ENGAGE WITH THE COMMUNITY. If this rule is taken advantage of, we're just going to delete anything that sounds like a shill and call it a day. It's tough to moderate these in-between type rules, because someone always tends to ride the pig into the mud. Consider this one a probationary rule, and if local businesses make it seem like a coffee shop bulletin board around here we'll just start deleting anything related to shill posts.

If you have any strong feelings for additional ways to make this a better online community, let us have it in the comments. Maybe you can convince /u/davidw or /u/HyperionsDad to make a wiki even, who knows.
