( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

STAR-POWERED FRAT BOY 
(Sam and Caleb)


Sam: ""So... your entire planet is gone? That's... horrible.""


Caleb: ""Yeah. But it's my fault. I saw the atrocities the Superior did to my people—killing them all. They were never gonna let them leave for Haven peacefully. They just needed a reason for the Kestrian people to let down their guard. Then they killed them all. Men, women, children. All of them. And I was forced to watch—imprisoned inside a star.""


Sam: ""Holy flog. That's... oh my god.. that's unthinkable!""


Caleb: ""Yeah. But turnabout is fair play, as you people say. I broke free from the star, unable to control my rage. And I slaughtered every single Superior and their entire android security force. Every. Single. One. Unfortunately, all that energy that I'd absorbed from the star, due to my Kestrian biology, was too much for the planet. It destabilized the core, and the ensuing destruction pulled in that star prison along with it—completely obliterating it and the surrounding space for an entire light-year. That explosion sent me hurtling into your solar system and launched me toward Earth. And now, here we are.""


Sam: ""... that's a lot to unpack, babe. Like... holy flog. That's... insane. Trauma dump unlocked.""

Caleb: ""Yeah. I know. It's not really believable.""

Sam: ""No no! It's plenty believable. It's just... you went through all of that... and you're still here. Choosing to lay here with a naked redhead, who's screwed up more times than she can count on both hands. That's the insane part, Caleb.""


Caleb: ""Well... what can I say? I love you. You showed me I don't have to carry all that. I can just be me. Empowered? Sure. But... we both are, now, babe. It's us against the universe. And I choose you. Every damn time, Foxy.""


Sam: ""You're making me want you again. I love you too, Caleb. You're... the anchor for all the trouble I bring on myself. And guess what, hottie? I choose you, too.""


Caleb: ""I'm glad. So... does that mean...""


Sam: ""Already on top of you, babe. I'm not going to work today, anyway. So... take me.""


Caleb: ""Don't have to tell me twice.""

[Later That Night]


Sam: ""Yeah. I'm not working at The Roast anymore... because I'm quitting.""


Caleb: ""Why? I thought you liked that job. Is it me?""


Sam: ""No babe. No it's not you. It's that fat bastard that tried to feel me up yesterday. And the boss defended HIM when I punched the guy. I don't need to work for someone who won't stand up for their employees.""


Caleb: ""Sam...""


Sam: What was I supposed to do? He copped a feel while I was at work! You would've punched him too. Don't even lie.""


Caleb: ""Oh, yeah. Definitely would've. Does that mean it's right? Not necessarily.""


Sam: ""So you actually agree with what I did?
You're not angry or horrified at my human brutality?""


Caleb: ""Agree? Yes. Horrified or angry?
Not at all.""


Sam: ""Really?""


Caleb: ""Yeah. I find it refreshing to see a woman that can handle herself. But, like I said before, if I was there—he'd be missing some teeth. And he'd be lucky to get off that easy.""


Sam: See... this? This is why I'm so in love with you. You defend me, but also call me on my BS. You're... perfect.""


Caleb: ""Ahh, no. Far from it, actually. But I'm here for you. And we're in this flogged up mess together, babe.""


Sam: ""You used my curse word? Honestly? Kinda turns me on.""


Caleb: ""I'm pretty sure everything I do does, in some form or fashion.""


Sam: ""Damn straight, Spaceman.""


Caleb: ""Even the weird things?""


Sam: ""Especially the weird things.""


Caleb: ""Good to know.""


Sam: ""That includes your weird fascination with licking me. I don't know why you do it, but it's hot and I'm here for it.""


Caleb: ""I know what I like. It's not my fault you taste like lavender and vanilla. It's your soap.""


Sam: ""Then why not just... drink the soap? You're alien. I'm sure it would be fine.""


Caleb: ""Because... the soap doesn't squeal with delight when I taste it.""


Sam: ""GASP! CALEB! Holy flog, babe! Wow. Okay. I'm leaving now...before I become a willing captive of your tongue.""


Caleb: ""Okay. But you'll have to come back sometime...""


Sam: ""I don't know what I'm to do with you, Space-Man.""


Caleb: ""I've got some ideas.""


Sam: ""I'll bet. So...breakfast, then?""


Caleb: ""I've got the meat right here, babe.""


Sam: ""CALEB! Oh my god! You're so bad. No. I want actual food. And coffee. Definitely coffee. Wow. Your mind is... just wow.""


Caleb: ""Well...I was just saying. I mean, it's hard to resist the beautiful woman beside me. It could be the intensity of the Mark and our cosmic bond. Or... it could just be that I really like it when you s—""


Sam: ""Okay! Okay! Enough. I'm seriously getting up and getting breakfast. You bad bad man.""


Caleb: ""Okay. I'll let you go make breakfast. No black coffee for me, though. Can't drink it.""


Sam: ""Yes, I know. You like yours with cream and sugar. Okay... I'm—ahh! What the hell? Did you just... lick my butt?""


Caleb: ""Maybe.""


Sam: ""Really? You like... that? You're into that? I mean, I know you like it, but... THERE?"" 


Caleb: ""Everywhere, Sam.""


Sam: ""Damn. Okay. Mental notes for later, I guess.""


Caleb: ""You might wanna hurry. I might not let you make to the kitchen.""


Sam: ""Wow. You're wild, Caleb. I'll have to watch out for you. You're like a star-powered frat boy. Damn, babe.


Caleb: ""Just like to keep things interesting. Plus, you're sweet enough, just stick your finger in it. As for the cream...""


Sam: ""Okay! Wow! Just stop! I thought I had a dirty mind! Holy flog, babe! You wanted to keep things interesting? Mission accomplished, Space-Man.


Caleb: ""I know what I like.""


Sam: ""Apparently. I'll have to remember that one."" 

Caleb: ""See you soon. Let me know when the coffee's ready, please.""


Sam: ""Will do, handsome. Oh, and... put some pants on. So I can actually focus. Shirt is... optional.""


Caleb: ""No promises.""


Sam: ""Wow. You're... just... wow.""


Caleb: ""I'm real, Sam. I'm what you need. And you're what I need.""


Sam: ""I'm gonna leave the room now, before I break down and cry and we end up having sex again.""


Caleb: ""Probably for the best.""


Sam: ""Yep.""

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Nowadays, most everyone thinks newsletters are just fluff or spam. But here’s what I actually learned after running thousands of emails.

Let's separate the fact from the fiction.

Myth #1: Email is dead.  
Fact: Nope. Email is thriving! Billions of people check their inbox daily. It’s the only channel where there’s no algorithm to fight with just to engage your people. I, personally check my inbox everyday (who's with me?). I kinda feel like there's something missing if I don't check it the first thing in the morning.

Myth #2: Time restricted.  
Fact: There are “best” days and times to publish newsletters. But honestly, people will open your emails because they’re valuable, NOT just because they’re published in time for coffee breaks. So having catchy subject lines are key!

Myth #3: An X amount of word count is better.  
Fact: Some like it short and straight to the point. Others want details and deep dives. Shorter isn’t better. Longer doesn’t mean more value. Whether it’s a quick tip or an in-depth review, relevance is better.

The truth is simple:  
Email isn’t dying — bad strategy is.

When you ditch the outdated myths and focus on clarity, value, and storytelling, your email marketing transforms from “just another channel” into something people actually look forward to.

This is exactly why we built Typelab. To help brands create newsletters that feel personal, intentional, and worth the open.

1p82xso,https://www.reddit.com/r/MetabolicMo/comments/1p82xso/tiny_daily_habits_that_actually_moved_the_needle/,Tiny Daily Habits That Actually Moved the Needle on My Fertility Journey,"After months of irregular cycles, high testosterone, and feeling completely overwhelmed by conflicting fertility advice, something shifted when the focus moved from drastic overhauls to micro habits.

One story really stood out: a woman with PCOS who implemented just 5 small daily changes (spearmint tea, protein breakfasts, 10-minute post-meal walks, better sleep hygiene, and smarter tracking). Her IUI got canceled because the clinic said she hadn't ovulated. She conceived naturally that same cycle.

**The 5 micro habits that made the difference:**

1. **Blood sugar-friendly breakfast** \- Protein + healthy fats + fiber (no more coffee and toast crashes)
2. **10-minute walks after meals** \- Helps insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation without intense workouts
3. **Tracking without obsessing** \- Use BBT and LH strips as a guide, not a test to pass
4. **Spearmint tea (2 cups daily)** \- Research-backed for lowering high testosterone
5. **Digital sunset** \- 1 hour screen-free before bed to protect melatonin and progesterone

**Bonus:** Getting 25-35g of fiber daily helps balance estrogen, lower insulin, and feed gut bacteria that regulate hormones.

None of these are groundbreaking on their own, but together they create an environment where the body can actually do what it's designed to do.

**For anyone struggling with PCOS, irregular cycles, or unexplained infertility:** what small habit has made the biggest difference for you? Or which one from this list feels most doable to start with?

1p82vum,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1p82vum/climax_of_the_wrong_sized_bra/,Climax of the Wrong Sized Bra,"I swung the car in a reckless U-turn, tyres squealing, heart louder.

Her door was cracked open, a slice of yellow light spilling out. I slipped inside, locked it, and she launched herself at me—no hesitation, arms around my neck, mouth crashing into mine like she’d been starving for years. She tasted like coffee and want. Her tongue swept in, bold and messy; she bit my lower lip hard enough to sting.

The fan whirred overhead but did nothing against the sweat already beading between us. I backed her against the wall, hands sliding under her top, finding warm skin and the satin edge of that new 36C I’d basically bullied her into buying. I palmed her breasts over the bra and she moaned into my mouth, arching so hard the cups nearly gave up.

“Been thinking about these all day,” I growled against her throat.

“Then stop thinking.”

Clothes came off in frantic layers—her kurti over her head, my shirt buttons popping, her jeans peeled down slim legs, my belt cl 1second clattering to the floor. She stood there in just that maroon bra and yellow satin panties printed with tiny red roses, nipples stiff against the lace, a damp spot already darkening the crotch.

I had her pressed against the wall, kissing like we were trying to bruise each other’s mouths. My hands were under her top, fighting with the hooks of that maroon 36C. One snap, two—she reached back herself, impatient, and ripped the bra open. The straps slid down her shoulders and the cups fell away like they’d been dying to surrender.
And there they were.

Heavy, perfect, swaying free for the first time in front of me. Full, round, a little flushed from being trapped all day. The weight of them made them hang just right—natural teardrops with dark nipples already stiff and begging. They bounced once, twice, when she shrugged the bra completely off and let it drop to the floor.
I couldn’t speak. Just stared, mouth dry, cock straining so hard against my jeans it hurt.

“Better than all your textile-shop fantasies?” 

she teased, voice husky, but she was breathing fast, shy and proud at the same time.

I answered by cupping them—finally skin on skin. They overflowed my palms, soft yet firm, warm and heavy like ripe fruit. When I lifted them gently, feeling their real weight, she let out a shaky little moan. I brushed my thumbs over her nipples and watched them tighten even more. She arched, pushing them harder into my hands, and the sight of those gorgeous, freed breasts swaying with every ragged breath nearly ended me right there.

“Fuck the wrong bra,” I muttered against her neck. 

“Look at them now.”

She laughed, low and dirty, then grabbed my wrist and dragged my hand lower.

 “Keep staring later. Touch me now.”

I dropped to my knees, mouthed her through the fabric, tasting her sweetness seeping through. She gasped, fingers tangling in my hair. I dragged the panties down, spread her with my thumbs and licked one long stripe up her slit. She was soaked, swollen, trembling.

“Bed,” she panted.

I lifted her—she weighed nothing—and tossed her onto the mattress. She laughed, breathless, then yanked my briefs off. My cock sprang free, heavy and leaking. Her eyes went wide; she wrapped her fingers around me, stroked once, twice, thumb swiping over the head.

“Shaved it this morning,” I said, voice gravel.

“Good boy.”

She pulled me down, guiding me between her thighs. I nudged at her entrance, met her eyes. She nodded, frantic.

I pushed in slow—fuck, so tight, so hot—until I bottomed out and we both groaned. She hooked her legs around my waist, heels digging into my ass, urging me deeper. I started to move, long strokes at first, then harder when she clawed my back and begged 
“Faster, please—”

The headboard slammed the wall with every thrust. Her tits bounced free when I ripped the bra up; I sucked one nipple into my mouth, rolled the other between my fingers. She cried out, inner walls fluttering around me.

I flipped her over mid-thrust, hauled her hips up, sank back in from behind. The new angle made her scream into the pillow. I reached around, found her clit, circled fast. She came hard—shaking, gushing, soaking my balls and the sheets beneath us.

That pushed me over. I pulled out at the last second, fisted myself twice, and painted thick ropes across her ass and lower back. She collapsed forward, panting, reaching back to rub my cum into her skin like she wanted to keep it there.

We lay wrecked, fan still spinning uselessly, sweat cooling on our bodies. After a minute she turned, kissed me slow and lazy, tasting both of us on my tongue.

“Next time,” 
she whispered against my lips, 
“you’re staying the whole night.”

I left an hour later only because we heard a neighbour’s dog bark too close. Shirt sticking to my back, thighs trembling, cock finally happy and spent. Drove home through empty streets, windows down, city smelling like rain and sex and her on my skin.

My parents neglected me severely growing up and I pretty much raised myself. I started cooking at age 9 to feed myself and there’s so much I had to learn on my own. I also faced a lot of emotional abuse. 

On my 30th birthday, everything changed for me. We went out for a family dinner and at the end my parents told me they had no money and that I had to pay for everyone. My mom said I’m an embarrassment because I’m single at my 30th birthday. They also got me no gift or card claiming they have no money. Something inside me broke after that birthday. I realized no matter how much effort and care I put in, they don’t care about me. It’s always about their needs over mine. I help them out financially.

In comparison, my sister is 50 and doesn’t work, she relies on my parents to pay for her rent and expenses and she’s clearly the favourite because they will pay for all her expenses but for example if we go to a cafe, they will not even pay a $2 coffee for me.

Recently I sent my sister $1500 Canadian because she claimed she had no money at all. 2 days later my dad asked her if she had any money and she said she had no money and she was hungry like WTAF? I told him she’s lying but they sent her more money anyways.

I’m the black sheep of the family and I’ve come to realize that and admit it. It’s just after my birthday something changed and I just feel like devastated. I’m in a lot of pain emotionally.",3,1764251832.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

Just calm.  
No panic.  
No shame.  
No racing mind.

That still gets me sometimes.  
Even after a little while of this.  
I get these quiet pockets of peace and I almost walk right past them because life moves fast.  
But when I stop and actually notice it, it hits me how different things are now.

I used to never have mornings like this.  
I was either foggy, hungover, pretending I was fine, or trying to hide how bad I felt.  
Everything was rushed.  
Everything was noise.

Nothing fancy.  
Just…being here.  
Being clear.  
Being myself without all the chaos I used to create.

Everything tastes bitter—sharp, hollow bitterness with very little sweetness or chocolate notes. No sourness, no brightness, just bitter and flat on both Starbucks Espresso Roast and Lavazza Super Crema.

**Roast date:**  
Not sure. Starbucks bag is a store-bought espresso roast for drip coffee (so probably months old). Lavazza Super Crema from Amazon—also likely older, only marked with a “best before” date.

**Roaster:**  
Starbucks, Lavazza (Amazon).

**Roast level:**  
Both seem medium to medium-dark.

**Bean details:**  
Lavazza Super Crema is a blend; Starbucks espresso roast is whatever their grocery-store bag version is. No single origins.

**Dose:**  
18g in the basket.

**Yield:**  
36g out.

**Time:**  
\~28 seconds.

**Temperature:**  
196°F.

**Workflow:**  
Meraki espresso machine. Using filtered water. Standard puck prep, no major channeling seen. Haven’t changed temperature yet. Tried tightening and loosening grind slightly but everything so far tastes bitter. Looking for suggestions on what to adjust so I can get a shot with something other than straight bitterness.

**What I’ve tried / observed:**  
– 18g → 36g ratio.  
– 28-second shot time.  
– Medium-dark beans, likely not super fresh.  
– Water filtration is solid.  
– Still getting an overwhelmingly bitter flavor even when grind/dose tweaks shift extraction slightly.

**Question:**  
What should I adjust first to get rid of the bitterness? Is it my beans, grind, temp, ratio, or something else with the Meraki? Any help getting a more balanced shot would be appreciated.",1,1764251736.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

When you finish drinking a Greek coffee, the leftover patterns dry into shapes figures, animals, paths, symbols.  
For centuries, readers would interpret these symbols as reflections of your energy, mood, or even what the day might bring.  
It’s surprisingly detailed. The shapes can look random, but they’re often recognizable once you’re shown what to look for.

I’ve been experimenting with this old tradition and also tried applying modern AI image analysis to it.  
What surprised me is how well AI can identify shapes in the cup patterns, and then generate “readings” based on the symbols it finds.  
It’s basically tasseography meets computer vision.

If anyone’s curious, I can share examples of the symbols, how they’re traditionally interpreted, and how the AI reacts to different cup patterns.

I try to resist it but can’t always control it. Even after drinking water, my mouth still feels dry (this happens during the day as well).
In the morning, I feel constipated.

About me:
I’m vegetarian (but I do eat eggs 🙂).
I go to the gym in the morning. My usual pre-workout was just a banana, and recently I started using a pre-workout supplement.
Even though I’ve been training for the last 1.5 years, I don’t look like I’ve put in that much time.

I have a desk job.
I live alone, so I prepare all my meals myself.
I’ve tried psyllium husk, read on net that I help with bowel movement.

I want to bulk up, but because of these issues I look skinny-fat (I have some fat around my belly). Whenever I increase my diet, these issues get worse.
Also, I can’t tolerate high-masala foods. Tea or coffee with milk causes stomach irritation and bloating.

One more point — my protein intake is low because of timing constraints. I’m not able to cook a full meal, so I usually just eat rice with paneer or soya chunks, with a little masala and salt, nothing else.

Do I need to consult a doctor, or should I just make diet changes?

Here’s what I did instead of pulling the trigger,"I was the guy with the nightstand bottle, the coffee-maker shooters, the office-stall ritual, and the pistol in my hand two years ago.

I wrote the whole ugly story. It’s long. It’s raw. It ends with me still breathing.

If you’re reading this at 3 a.m. wondering if anyone would really be better off without you — this is for you.

Not selling anything. Just a lower-middle-class dad who’s 687 days sober hoping this lands with one guy who needs it tonight.

Wives/partners — if this sounds like your husband, feel free to forward it.

# I Planned MY Suicide. Then I Killed My Old Life.

A father’s story of alcoholism, a gun, and a chance at redemption.

There it was. That black shadow with the hissing voice: You’re done. You can’t do this anymore. Some men are winners and then there’s you. Fuck it. End it. Weak words. I don’t mean that they are words of weakness, I mean the words that you are reading on this page are a tiny maggot on the rotten ass of the elephant that was this voice.

I take another swallow of the brown liquid and a shiver lurches through me. As I put the pint-bottle back into my pocket, my mouth waters the way it does when a person might be about to vomit. I open my mouth and let the saliva roll freely over my bottom lip and onto the front of my shirt. I look into the mirror at what I think is me. I blame the sharp lighting in this bathroom for my yellow teeth and the dark, puffy pouches under my nicotine-spit-colored eyes.

I hate myself. Not because I’m a drunk. Not because I shit my pants five-minutes ago and I still haven’t cleaned myself up. No, I hate myself because of the coward in me that needs the drink to function. I hate my fear that other people will see me for what I know that I am. I hate that I’ve ran from things that other men who don’t seem to be too special themselves, have seemingly faced with little difficulty. I hate my unwillingness to try for something more, but I know that it’s all for nothing anyway. Everyone else catches breaks, but not me. I barely feel anything, or I feel too much of everything. There is no in-between.

This is me on the morning of my fortieth birthday, hiding in the bathroom of my house, while my wife and four kids are somewhere on the other side of the door, living their own lives without an inkling that I am contemplating the best way to go to sleep forever.

The thoughts have come and gone in the past three-weeks. That serpent’s lips just behind my ear: *They really will be better off without you. Sure, there will be some pain that goes with losing you, but they’ll get over that. It’s better than the living influence that you have on them now. Hell, one of these days you may end up killing all of you in one drunken car ride. What’s the point of it all? You never follow through with anything. You’ve never won anything. You have no talents. A man should be able to build something. Can you build anything? A man should be able to fix things. Is anything that you touch any better off after you try to mess with it? No.*

This might be a good spot to say something cliché like, “How did I get here?” Or, “How did it all go so wrong?”

But that would be bullshit.

For years I have taken a very specific road that could’ve only led to exactly where I am right now.

I spend every night waking up around 3 a.m., heaving, shaking, and rolling over to clutch whatever bottle I have stashed in the bottom drawer of my nightstand. I violently hold the sloshing bottle against my mouth to spill a couple of slugs down my throat instead of all over my torso. I’m usually good then, to have a smoke and shut my eyes for another two hours before my alarm goes off and it’s time to get ready for work.

Then the day begins…

I sit up and swallow whatever is left of the bottle in my nightstand drawer, and I put the empty pint into my work bag so I can throw it out somewhere on my way to work to avoid the presence of bottles in my trash at home. I shuffle down the hallway into the bathroom and relieve my bladder of its maple-colored contents and make my way to the kitchen.

I pour a cup of coffee and grab two of the four shooters that I have hidden behind the coffee maker. I down the shots using a swallow of coffee as a chaser and bury the empties into the trashcan underneath some used paper plates. I light a cigarette and drop the other two shooters into the pocket of my pajama pants so they will be close at hand when I am in the shower in case I vomit when the hot water and the panicky thoughts about the day ahead hit me. *You’re a fraud. This is NOT how a man acts. How long can you pretend to carry this on?*

Out of the shower and dressed, I brush my teeth making sure it is the last thing I do before I leave the house. (This often makes no difference at all as I may take a shot on my drive into work, in which case I will stop on the backroad on the way in and gargle some of the mouthwash that I keep in the middle console of my truck.)

Every day at the office is a constant act filled with anxiety, shame, and that same voice: *Your last drink was less than two-hours ago. Do you think they can’t smell it on you? Visine might get some of the redness out of your eyes, but they are still puffy and full of fear. You’re not fooling anybody. They’re talking about you in whispers and they think, that you think, that you’re getting away with this. They see you shaking even when you try to camouflage it with other movements , and you can’t deny your oily-red complexion. Trust me, you are not hiding it well.*

I go to the restroom once every two or three-hours, back to the farthest stall from the door, and I guzzle down a shooter or two to quiet some of the nerves and to stave off the inevitable sickness that will come if I do not follow this ritual.

I keep two liquors of choice for the workday:

1. Fireball-a cheap whiskey with a cinnamon flavor, the scent of which I believe I can cover up with Big Red chewing gum.
2. Vodka- most drunks choose willful ignorance in the belief that we can cover up the smell of vodka with just about anything.

Once I have taken my shots in the stall, I put the empty bottles in my pocket, pop some gum or a cough drop, and take care when I walk not to let the empties rattle around and give up my secret. I will make a few trips out to my truck to stash the empties and grab some fresh bottles throughout the day under the guise of grabbing something else such as a pack of smokes or any other excuse I come up with.

The workday having been survived, I start my drive home. I take a two-lane backroad in front of the office that runs parallel to the river where there is a tree-line on one side and a levee on the other. I wait until the office is about the size of a Lego in my rearview mirror and I break out the last two or three shooters and take my first couple of carefree drinks of the day and discard my empty bottles out the window into the tree-line on the roadside.

Lighting a cigarette, inhaling deeply, and exhaling all the stress of the past few hours, I think to myself, *I will drink less tonight and try to get to sleep a little earlier. That way, I’ll have had some decent sleep, even though I’ll wake up somewhere around 3 a.m. again, with my body screaming for a drink.*

I stop at the Pit Stop and grab what I need. A couple of sleeves of shooters and a pint of whiskey should get me through tonight and the workday tomorrow. I make small talk with the cashiers and do my best in the short conversation to act like a regular hard-working guy that is just grabbing some drinks to enjoy casually after work. The clerks are friendly enough, but they know I’m full of shit, and that I’ll be right back in here as soon as I get off tomorrow.

I call my wife on the way home and ask her if she needs anything while I’m out. On the days that she does need me to make a quick stop, I typically use that opportunity to grab a few more drinks, whether it is a half-pint or just a few shooters to rathole somewhere safe should I need them in a pinch. Pulling into my driveway, I pop a cough drop into my mouth and make sure that there are no visible bottles in my truck before going inside.

One of my girls has soccer practice tonight, and my youngest has gymnastics. My wife will take the gymnastics duty, and I agree to take soccer practice since it is held at a fantastic indoor facility that has a bar and grill. I blend in really well there with the majority of parents who also like to have a drink or two while their kid is running around for a couple of hours. It also means that I will not have to worry about reeking like alcohol for the rest of the night as my wife will just chalk it up to me having a couple of drinks at the practice and the few that I will have at home.

Once we are all back at home we have dinner and take our showers. The kids settle into bed, and I pour about three fingers of whiskey into my favorite glass. My wife and I talk to each other about our day and find something to watch on TV for an hour or two. I kiss her goodnight, and shuffle down the hall to the bedroom to lie in bed and scroll on my phone for about an hour before I pass out.

That’s it. Every day is the same.

The only variances may be:

1. Baseball or basketball practice instead of soccer and gymnastics.
2. Clowning around with the kids for a while.
3. House work that I have neglected that I will take too long to finish and no doubt piss and moan the entire time I’m doing it.
4. Me, ruining whatever show or movie we are watching because I am talking about work, or whatever sadness from my past that I choose to dwell on.
5. Sex with my wife instead of walking to bed alone.
6. Us arguing because of my insecurities and her perceived superiority complex.
7. Me damaging one or all of my children’s sense of security when they see their dad acting like a weak child.

I know that I will die a disgusting, humiliating death if I keep going down this road, but I’m not sure that my mind can take another alcohol cleanse. Ridiculously, this is not the first time that I have found myself in the same desperate spot.

I used to detox myself at home a couple of times a year when things would really get out of control. I guess it just got harder on me with age. I’ve added up countless days and nights of sweating, freezing, sickness, shaking my bones out of my skin, and laying in the cool wet swamp of nausea and toxicity. The feel of the sheets was like smearing Crisco all over my body and pulling dirty clothes on top of it. The voice was always there; not as strong or as often as it seems to be more recently, but there. You’re a worm in mud. I try like hell to focus for just ten seconds on one thing, but the horrific thoughts ricochet like seventeen ping-pong balls in my wooden skull. You’ll never be a man. God, the hallucinations! Hearing music coming from the heating vents in the floors and the oscillating fan in my room. Seeing shadows like ooze and smoke crawling around the walls, and rapid glimpses of movements like small birds and insects just in the corner of my eye. Not to mention the unending cycle of shame and anxiety that goes with staying locked in my room, puking in a trash can while my wife is taking on all the responsibilities of running our home by herself.

People think an alcoholic can quit with just a little bit of willpower, but that’s not it. Hell, even most functioning alcoholics think they know how bad it can get, but until they live it, shit…

I carried on with the above-mentioned routines for years until I finally broke down. One night, eight years ago, I resolved to tell my boss the next morning how I had been living and that I may need to take a few days off to get myself together. He took pity on me and consulted with some of the higher-ups of the company, and they secured me a bed at a local rehab facility. I was immediately sent to detox at a hospital before the rehab would even admit me due to my rattling, my yellow eyes, and sky-high blood pressure.

The medications at the hospital helped with the withdrawals a bit. Slowly getting my appetite back and being pumped full of good nutrients and being surrounded by like-minded people with many of the same afflictions, fears and hopes felt like a Godsend. For that moment in time I didn’t feel so isolated and alone. There were many others battling the same issues as me, but despite my low opinion of myself, I still couldn’t help but feel that my situation was just a little different from most of the others’.

When I got home, things went well for about three months. With a new morning routine, practicing mindfulness, and attending AA meetings a few times a week, things seemed to be getting better. I was a better man for my wife and a better father to my kids. For the most part the cravings and ever-existing triggers were still a daily struggle, but I could shake that shit off. *One day at a time.*

Then, I figured, with my newfound wisdom and coping mechanisms, I would be alright to have an occasional drink or two as long as I was doing it at appropriate times. A few drinks at get-togethers, or after work, turned into a few more, turned into a couple of whiskey shots with my coffee in the morning, then a couple more swallows just a few hours later, and so on, and spiral. Things carried on the same way for another six years until I had another breakdown and was fired from my job for “performance and attendance issues”.

That brings us right back to me being hunched over, leaning with both palms on either side of my sink, staring at the golem in the mirror crying, knowing that I am going to kill myself. I thought of driving my truck into the river, hanging myself, or jumping off the nearby bluffs, but I saw a flaw with each one of those methods. *You might not die if you drive into the river. You’re too much of a pussy to hang yourself. Jumping off the bluffs might leave you as a vegetable, but still living.*

A couple of days later, I was about as sick as I’d ever remembered being. I was wobbling like a baby deer and unable to keep any food down. From past experiences I knew that the hospital would be of no help to me as they had refused to admit me before due to smelling like alcohol, or answering “yes” when one of the nurses asked me if I drank more than occasionally. So I went to an Urgent Care located a few blocks from my house, and they looked me over and told me that I had pneumonia. I picked up the steroids and other medications that I was prescribed, mainly to show my wife that I must be legitimately sick if the doctor says I need meds. I went home to pack a bag and to tell my family that I was heading out to my dad’s house in the country to avoid spreading my sickness to them. I backed out of the driveway and drove down my street watching my youngest daughter waving in my rearview and knowing in my soul that I was going to shoot myself in the head back in the woods behind my father’s house.

Since you’re reading this, I guess there’s no need to tell you what I didn’t do. So I’ll tell you what I did. I drove to my dad’s house and talked with him. I told him about my having pneumonia and that I was quitting drinking. Then, I waited until he was out the next day, and I opened the drawer where he kept one of his pistols. I saw that the magazine was missing from the pistol, and I checked for a round in the chamber. I sat and thought for a few long minutes. I wondered if my father had suspected something and if that was why the magazine wasn’t in the pistol as it had been any other time. I thought about my family carrying on without me. I thought about how long I had felt so alone.

I made one phone call. They didn’t answer. I staggered out to the front porch and stared at the field across the road. My phone rang. I spoke honestly and didn’t hold back anything. The voice on the other end didn’t offer much sympathy, but they spoke these simple truths:

1.You’re not alone.

2.You’re isolating yourself, and only you really know why.

3. Even the ones that don’t like you very much right now still love you, and they want you to do better.

4. The ones that don’t want you to do better don’t matter.

5. Nobody that loves you would be better off without you.

6. Stop breaking their hearts, and yours will start to heal as well.

7. It’s not weak to reach for help.

This is my call to the dad out there that may be going through something similar. You, man. Life is brutal, and it doesn’t come with a playbook for rough years. We are supposed to be the protectors and the providers, but when we’re locked inside ourselves, it makes it nearly impossible to give the necessary attention to our outside worlds. We might compare ourselves to our heroes and get stuck on ways that we don’t measure up, but remember that our heroes have their weak moments, too. If you constantly compare your inside to everyone’s outside, you’re gonna see some of the worst of you in contrast with some of the best of others.

I’m 27F, was a chronic doom-scroller, 4 cups of coffee a day, TikTok until 3am, dating apps for validation, the whole mess. My focus was non-existent, my savings were a joke, and I was having daily anxiety attacks about “wasting my 20s.”

So on January 1st 2025 I said screw it and started what I now call my “Silent Year”:

• Deleted TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, dating apps....
• No music/podcasts/audiobooks while commuting or working out (pure silence)
• No caffeine, no alcohol....
• No buying anything that wasn’t food or absolute necessity
• Gray-rocked almost all group chats (only replied when directly asked something)
• I thought I was gonna lose my mind in week 2

Instead, this happened:

Month 1-3: Pure hell. Couldn’t focus for more than 20 minutes, boredom felt like physical pain.
Month 4: Suddenly could read 300-page books in 2 days. Like actually remember them.
Month 6: Got a 30% raise because my work quality became “scary good” (boss’s words)
Month 8: Paid off $18k credit card debt (I didn’t even know I had that discipline in me)
Month 10: Started waking up at 4:45am NATURALLY. No alarm. Still happening.
Now (Month 11): Net worth tripled, body fat at all-time low, zero anxiety meds, and I’m genuinely excited to be alive every single day.

The craziest part? I barely post anywhere anymore… but my real life feels like I’m living in 4K while everyone else is still on 240p.

If you’re addicted to stimulation and feel stuck, try just 30 days of this. I promise your brain will thank you.

Roads are generally good, traffic is chill, and distances are short. Just avoid driving at night, the mountain curves can get sketchy.

When I get home past 11 PM, she often asks me to make her a late-night snack. Honestly, the only time we feel truly happy and connected is during those evening meals and chats. But sometimes, I'm just too exhausted to do anything but rest, and I struggle internally... 

I'm gradually realizing we need to build connections during the day, even if responses aren't immediate, it helps us feel each other's presence. Otherwise, we end up bottling up all our emotions until nightfall.

The good news is that I now make her a cup of hot coffee every morning when I get up! This makes her feel more comfortable when she wakes up, which is an improvement over before.

I think we might need help to maintain that connection during our busy daytime schedules.

How do you keep the spark alive with your partner when work is overwhelming? Does anyone have tips? I'm genuinely seeking advice.

TL;DR: From student romance to working life, our days are no longer as carefree as before. We often come home exhausted. I search for inspiration to show her she's still the spark in my heart.",2,1764250523.0,relationshipadvice,1,1.0,False

A terrible start to my day, was late for the train and missed it. Was totally flustered and late for college. Even though I had to wait 20 minutes for the next one I somehow forgot to tap my leap card, was wandering around wondering if I should grab a cup of coffee, only realising when the inspector came calling while half asleep on the train. 

What gets me is that there is zero understanding of legitimate human error. I was honest, told the inspector that I just realised that I forgot to tap it. The card has €50 credit on it, there’s no reason why I would intentionally not tap it. The inspector proceeds to accuse me of being a regular evader, notes that I haven’t used the card for a few weeks, yes because I’m not in full time employment and have been driving more often recently. He literally just demands all my details, name address and ago (for some reason?) and than hands me the fine before walking away.

I’m not looking for any sympathy, just annoyed at the complete lack of compassion from the guy. Zero fucks given by him. On top of all this I recently had my student leap card rejected even though I’m in full time employment.

M28 occasional smoker, non-drinker. sadly no current xray available. I had a filling re-done 2 weeks ago on my lower right molars (I think 30/31?), she said she could see a gap developing on the old fillings and after the procecure said that there was caries under them and she had to drill rather deep and my teeth might hurt for a little bit.  
After the numbness went away I almost immediately was in some pain, but was fine after taking an ibuprofen.

Over the next 2 weeks I noticed that I still feel sensible to anything cold (breathing through my mouth, drinking anything colder than room temp) - there is a tiny delay and then a sharp pain that subsides but leaves a lingering pain. I also feel there is a general soreness which is sometimes more painful and other times not very noticeable. I have been taking pain killers roughly every other day when it became too annoying. Usually I wake up fine without pain and it worsens throughout the day.

Went to the dentist again on monday and she did some testing on it (cold test, bite on something and release quickly, tapping on the tooth) and said she thinks that the nerve is irritated but she does not see a need for a root canal therapy. On Tuesday, I ate something really hot that immediately triggered pain that only went away after extra painkillers, today it is again only pain that triggers on cold tap water - had a coffee and that was okay.

I am supposed to go on vacation for 2 weeks on sunday but I am worried about the pain not improving yet. Is there anything else I can do other than try to give the tooth some rest? If the pain persists, will I be fine if I come back in 2-3 weeks to the dentist?

*With Amber and Rose Tinted Glasses*

The sweet, sickly kick of nostalgia is the gravity by which it can propel the heart. The intensity of its grip on the psyche is fascinating, as you’ll observe the most emotionally absent of people be reduced to tears by a seemingly insignificant memento from a box of childhood possessions.

Such was the natural progression of all things, since humans are concerned so deeply with the passage of time, that we would also be frivolous in our hunt to reclaim what has since drifted past.

I gripped the wheel tightly, fingernails digging and plucking at the loose threads that embroidered the inner lining of the leather steering wheel in my car. Had it not already been rather mistreated, surely it’d strike me as a more cruel action.

The drive was very short between the cafe and the central commons where the festival was held, yet I made somewhat of a conscious effort to take a convoluted route to get there. It wasn’t needlessly out of the way, but I chose to break off the main road quickly and traverse residential streets to add some buffer to my arrival.

These streets were familiar in a rather unfamiliar format. As opposed to drawing on direct memory of the bigger picture, I’d occasionally cross over a house or two that had maintained it’s original charm through the years. The weather-worn homes of old, contrasting the pristine new developments or remodels that made up a majority of the property density in the modern Franklin. 

What likely would drive an HOA to tears had deeply impacted me and my desire to persevere into the uncomfortable territory of potentially shattering yet another childhood perception of this place. 

Within all change, there is persistence. Throughout the progression of what has become, there must always be a vision of what once was.

My feet graced the cobble on the outskirts of the commons, and bricks outlined the exterior of the rough-surfaced walking paths that wove through the center of the park and culminated in the central pavilion.

The sights and sounds of the afternoon coming to life as mid-day feels over the carnival grounds. It wasn’t lively, as most of the stalls were closed for the moment until the schools let out and folks got off work.

The mystique of the environment still radiated with a longing. There was something peaceful about the daytime stroll; the lack of ambient hustle and bustle gave way to a serene introspection.

I crossed the threshold into the park where the large burlap slides loomed overhead, and the tented carnival games littered the lowlands. As if the mighty mountain of a slide cast an ever-vigilant shadow over the township of the carnival stalls.

I had my hands tucked into the front of my sweatshirt, panning my vision back and forth between each colorful, halloween themed decoration. I could feel the abrasion of a thin breeze as it softly whipped at my upper lip, my mouth suddenly feeling rather dry.

Before long I was face-to-face with the familiar yet shockingly unsafe-looking rides of the carnival. The spinning tea cups, the children's dragon mini roller coaster, and of course, the centerpiece of all good festivals;

The Ferris wheel.

I had always dearly feared heights; it’s the main reason I’ve only ever been on two roller coasters in my life and desperately hated them. While it wasn’t even a ferris wheel in the movie, I also recall forever having carnivals tainted for me when I watched The Sandlot movie, and the kids all packed a gross lip of “Big Chief” and threw up after riding all the rides.

I’d always loved seeing my friends at events like this, especially if it so happened that my mother wasn’t able to get in contact with anyone else’s parents before we went to coordinate going. It was a relatively common occurrence, unfortunately, that I rode solo with my mom, but that was a common theme of my life when it came to going out in public.

With my eyes fixed firmly at the apex of the Ferris wheel, I caught myself holding in the air of my breath. The involuntary action of suffocating myself wasn’t chance-based; I’d been locked in a recollection.

When I was younger, in those childhood “golden years,” I’d been quite a little soccer player. Essentially, every kid in Franklin was a soccer player at that age, even though we all loved to run around, and our parents enjoyed how we would get all tuckered out after games and become quite manageable.

My team was never exceptionally good, and we were part of a cultural phenomenon that many people cite today as “softening the youth”. Mike, Duke, and I all earned a participation award when our team inevitably did not make it past the regular season into the illustrious playoffs.

Our parents, as a consolation for our lackluster season and subsequent low morale, brought us to a little ice cream and seafood shop on the outer edges of Bellingham.

Rosewood’s was the spot, it always will be the spot I’m sure. It was a charming little New England spot, open Memorial Day to Labor Day, with a quaint new england maritime interior to the place, and a nice gravel outdoor seating area. My personal favorite aspect of it was the rides outside you could sit on for a few quarters, which would move around. 

Being perpetually out of coin change as a child, I commonly opted to sit on it when business was slow and just eat my ice cream on it. I always wanted to get cookies and cream with a waffle cone and rainbow sprinkles. While that stands the test of time, I’ve grown to appreciate a cone in a cup, as well as the splendor of coffee ice cream.

Nevertheless, I wolfed my ice cream because Duke’s mother was prospecting the idea of bringing him to the Summer Festival in town, which is a very similar carnival format event to the Fall Festival.

I wanted to go so badly, and had convinced myself that if I didn’t finish that ice cream before they left, my mother would make me stay here and eat the ice cream. Nothing was saying I couldn’t just go after, but I was so convinced I’d miss out on the fun, I had to speed run, eating the ice cream.

Shockingly, a child who eats ice cream incredibly fast and isn’t particularly well known for handling dairy very well wasn’t an awesome combination with fast-moving mechanical devices, and by the time the sun started to fall for the night, I’d really grown worse for wear.

I can remember the exact feeling of my lower stomach hurting with a light jabbing pain, and my throat perpetually having the sting of acid reflux by the second ride. 

For all of my fortitude and resolve, I really did try to hold out until the night was over to detonate, but fate had no such plans for me.

I stood right in this exact spot… Well, that’s dramatic. I have no idea where the ferris wheel was at the time, but I can at least say this is quite an accurate recreation of what feels like the spot. But I stood here, and slowly observed the Ferris wheel seats come down from the top, and then slowly ascend to the very tippy top, and stop.

They just stayed there, one of the seats marked at the summit, while everyone just waited until the ride was over. I, however, could wait no longer.

In lieu of mortifying detail, I’ll just say that while all of my friends got on the ride together, I stood doubled over a trash can throwing up while my mother tried to comfort me, tears in my eyes from a mix of the horrendous smell, the burn in my chest, and the feeling of being left of.

It wasn’t just that I missed out on the ride; it was that I think doing stuff with my best friend was really important to me back then. In a way that I can’t quantify now, as if hanging out with Duke really did mean more to me than the time I spent with anyone else.

Alas, Mike and Duke ended up sharing the experience. For what it’s worth, knowing what I know now, I can’t say I wish for a different outcome. 

In all of my quiet contemplation, I had drifted away from the real world, and become engrossed in my own storytelling. Perhaps the story was a good reminder of what I was doing in Franklin. I’d known that at the end of the day, my guilt behind the circumstances of Mike’s disappearance was a harsh perspective on me as a child. What I can say for certain though, is that I am no longer the version of myself that didn’t act. This feels like the opportunity to make peace with the reality of what Franklin, Massachusetts means to me.

If not to find Mike, then to find closure.

**Chapter 12**

*The Woven Web*

For the rest of the day, I delved into the necessity of combing through the fine details of the stories about the Hathcoats and the Prohibition while really dialing in on the handful of disappearance stories I had access to. 

I was going entirely off the very loose connection of the time frames, but there had to be something I hadn’t seen yet that bridged the gap in correlation. 

I can’t really put into words the fugue state I was in that convinced me the two were related. I was convinced there was something more to the very bare-bones history of Franklin and the insidious nature of all the missing people.

I knew Mikey was more than just a statistic in the group; he was among the final of the missing kids, and he was where the threads met. 

I wanted to go into my eventual foot-search as well informed as I could be. If there was even a shred of potential that I was walking into something dangerous, I needed to not be blindfolded in my expedition.

I suppose I haven’t really overviewed my plan to this point, since I didn’t have much of one when I stepped foot back on home turf.

In the months prior to this trip home, I had been attempting to recall as much as I could about the night where everything changed. My intention was to approach the events of the night with the hypothetical belief that what I saw was entirely non-fiction. 

With the idea in mind that I saw a tall, thin figure skulking in the woods past the powerlines, I came to two conclusions. Firstly, I determined there was no possibility that the aforementioned figure could have been Mikey or Derrick. Neither of them were tall enough, nor thin enough to fit within the silhouette. One advantage of being haunted by the sight of something horrifying, you become very intimately familiar with the image. 

Nightmares are by no means a gift in this scenario. I’m not attempting to imply my trauma was something of a superpower, but I can at the very least affirm that this scene had been burned into my head over years of replaying it. I know without a shadow of a doubt that the figure I saw was a complete and total stranger.

The second conclusion I was led to came from reviewing the statements police took from not only Cole and Duke, but also from Leo and Erik. It was a small note in the greater scheme of the investigation that wouldn’t raise any red flags *unless* you were in the woods yourself to reference the directions they gave.

The short and narrow was simple. Cole and Duke described being in a position where they were in the process of turning around and heading back to the neighborhood, though once they fully turned around and began heading back, Mikey took a hard left and began heading outwards from the group with the intention of creating separation so he could draw the older kids away if they all got caught since it’d be easier to catch one person instead of two.

Leo and Erik reported that *before* they caught the tracks of Mikey, Cole and Duke and realized they had turned back around to try and slip them, Derrick had taken a *sharp left* to corner Justin and I. The timeline highlighted just before they reached the right-of-way lines, and subsequently, when we passed into the deeper woods.

The presented information explained a very important distinction to me as someone in the woods that day, that nobody had paid credence to. If you drew a map of the woods, it would display that as both groups had a member split off, those members traveled in opposite directions. Derrick in the direction of the main road that intersected with the opening of the neighborhood, and Mikey went deeper into the woods towards the town’s edge.

If you don’t understand a right-of-way and how they function, they are the massive powerline towers that cut through clearings in the woods. They are “transmission lines” and transmit power from the power facility to the power lines you see on the road. They don’t stop until they reach another facility, hence their naming convention. 

The implication being that there would be no loop around where the woods would wrap itself around to meet with the section of woods on the opposite side of the clearing without reaching a road or another clearing.

Since both of them were still participating in the game, and with the way Leo and Erik turned around when reaching the clearing, both Mikey and Derrick would have no reason to pass over like me and Justin so stupidly did, further confirming my suspicions that neither of them would have passed over to our side of the woods in the window where I saw the figure.

While I didn’t need the confirmation to know what I saw didn’t biologically match up to the boys, I needed to discern a linear path for the theory I was cooking up. 

If nothing else, I realized how it was so easy for people to place blind faith in a conspiracy theory.

If I wanted to, I could draw entirely subjective connection points between events for this situation, and easily dismiss it off as a government cabal that was harvesting children to sacrifice them to a dark god. Obviously, those words all placed onto the page read as the ramblings of a crazed maniac who has long since departed with his mental faculties. 

The point of that analogy is present the reason why I wanted to be thorough when committing to a rational thought process.

The reality of pursuing the truth behind this scenario did have a level of caution related to it, since if there was some capacity of an unwell individual behind the disappearances, I could be walking into a bear trap if the proper precautions were not taken.

I needed to determine a few things for sure on this trip before I could justify physically looking in those woods; Firstly, I needed to collect enough information to place validity in the potential of there being a driving force behind the disappearances that was more than just the danger of nature. 

Secondly, if I could validate that concern, I needed to gather as much information as possible on the physical location where I may find this individual.

I would be lying if I didn’t think I knew where it was all this time. I’ve been looking for the way it ties into my current theory, and it has been my ace in the hole. For anyone else, it would have been a stupid thought to believe something I saw when I was an eight-year-old might play a greater part in a child kidnapping scheme years and years in the future.

Something I had learned from the guilt that overtook me of not mentioning what I saw that day, is that there was no piece of information that was truly insignificant. The smallest details, the most seemingly minute events can always play a part.

I believe now, more than ever, with the information of what I learned, that somehow that stone building in the woods has a part to play.

**Chapter 13**

*A Grim Actualization*

It’s not definitive, for all I know it’s just an abandoned old auxiliary building in the middle of the woods that teenagers had been going to for years on weekends to tag with graffiti and throw little parties at. However for as long as I was in Franklin, I distinctly remember that teenagers didn’t come to our side of town.

For all of the benefits of the woods to a bunch of High School kids that want to drink and party without the presence of Authority figures, it seemed to me like the woods of Franklin’s outer rim would be the ideal meeting point.

However, quite the opposite was true. You commonly couldn’t get anyone from out of the area to come that way to hang out. It was like this heavy cloud of paranoia had kept everyone at arm's length from the section of town.

Nonetheless, my plan hinged primarily on the luck of the draw. I needed to rely on my resourcefulness to gain access to a lot of information that I frankly didn’t have the necessary titles or clearances to justify my eyes seeing them.

I had my work cut out for me at this point to really pull out a hail mary of some sort to get access to anything I could. With each passing day I was getting closer to just pulling the trigger and blindly wandering through those woods until I found what I was looking for, but there would be no reality where that was a well-informed decision.

By the time I’d allowed myself to fall into unconsciousness, I’d felt as though I was immediately thrust into the waking world from a dreamless sleep. Clearly time had passed since the sun was peaking through a slit in my curtains, but I’ll be damned if I wasn’t somehow more tired now than when I passed out.

Nevertheless, the time had finally arrived for me to meet up with Cole, a very much anticipated part of this trip. I’ve been chomping at the bit for this moment so I could really dig through some of the recent events of Franklin that had come around in my absence.

I crossed town rather effortlessly, my body knew how to navigate the roads that had grown somewhat foreign to me. It’s likely I was passing by shortcuts and easier routes in favor of the roads my mother would have taken when I was younger.

As I crested the top of a hill in the Franklin Industrial park I found myself slowly pulling onto a dirt road at the back of the parking lot and dipping into a clearing in the treeline. Here I saw the gambit of construction equipment stalled in time as I presume the workers had turned off the ignition and sprinted to their lunchboxes the moment noon hit.

I was wondering which truck Cole was in for lunch, though nobody had looked familiar to me as I passed by.

As I crawled closer to the rear of the jobsite, I saw a man standing at the top of a small staircase connected to an office trailer.

“Well hot damn…” I muttered to myself, pulling into the empty space in front of him that he was pointing to. I hopped out of the car, a little taken aback by what I was seeing.

“Cole Whitaker?”

“In the flesh.”

His smile was incredibly infectious. It seemed the kid who had been notorious for his naivety had grown up to be a self made man. We embraced in a quick bro hug, and I gave him a hard pat on the upper arm.

“Well I'll be damned Cole, to think you’d go from arguing with Justin if bugs were animals to running a construction site some day…”

“Hey, I still attest that my logic was sound and hard to argue against, all things considered.”

I gave him a hearty laugh and looked around me into the wooded construction site that surrounded us.

“I don’t wanna hold you up from eating, I’m sure your time is limited.”

“We’ve got as long as I say we have. We’re waiting for a couple of third parties to complete their work before my guys can get back into the thick of it, so it’s a relaxed day. C’mon, we’ll head in at least and get down to the nitty gritty.”

We dipped into the office trailer, it was nice, like a corner office built into a box on wheels. Cole leaned back into his seat, and started to unpack some lunch items from a large lunch box to the side of his desk. It seemed like he was eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on multigrain bread, a few chewy bars, an apple, and a redbull. I couldn’t help but let a smirk slip as I internalized the thought that he was eating a school lunch designed for adults, the only part he was missing was the chocolate milk and a white styrofoam tray.

“So, what exactly brings John Anderson back to Franklin? It’s been what, almost ten years since you’ve stepped foot in town? Well, at least as far as I know.”

“You’re not mistaken, it’s coming up pretty soon on the anniversary when my mom picked us up and moved us to West Virginia.” I ran a hand along the back of my neck, it was hard not to feel guilty, as if it was my fault she moved us. In reality, it was mainly my fault for waiting until now to come back.

“How’d Appalachia treat you? I’ve heard a little bit of everything about the region.” He’d bite down on the apple, a low pop and crunch as he pulled a chunk away from the apple and chewed on it idly.

“It was alright, though we moved pretty quickly round the area, in those years between leaving here and joining the military I must have moved like four times.”

“Well jeez, I wish I knew you were a military man. I would have thanked you for your service.” A belly laugh rattled through the office truck.

“Heh, I’m sure you know the general feelings about that statement.”

“Ya, trust me some of my guys are veterans. I’ve grown familiar with the sentiment by this point.”

We sat in silence for a brief period of time. It became very apparent to me that in my excitement to get here, I had completely forgotten to bring a lunch of my own. 

It was Cole who broke the heavy silence.

“So what’re you here for, John. You’re the first person to come back to town in a long time. Duke’s been unreachable for years, Justin went off to his new life in Texas and hasn’t had any interest in coming back, and then Mikey… well that’s an obvious one. I’m the only one who is stuck around here, so you can see why it’d be a little suspicious to me that you’re here out of nowhere and reach out to me after years of silence.”

Ah, yes, the confrontation I had been expecting. I learned forward, my elbows resting on my knees, and my hands bound together as if I were in prayer. 

“I’m sorry that it took me this long to reach out, Cole. I really am, I mean that. I’ve been going through it for the years that have passed since the day Mikey and Derrick vanished, and I’ve been trying to find peace now that I’m an adult, but I haven’t found much in the way of luck.”

“You and I both. Hell, Justin and Duke all but fell off the wagon after Mikey went missing. Your mom was pretty quick to move you away, but the three of us stayed around until we turned eighteen and then went our separate ways. You weren’t the only one that struggled with it.”

“I know, I can only imagine what it must have been like staying in that neighborhood while it fell  apart.”

Cole cracked open his Red Bull with a harsh snap and hiss. He took a quick sip and leaned forward with his arms resting on the table.

“Look, John, let’s just be realistic about all of this. Do you need something from me? Is there something you’re hoping to get from me by coming around and trying to dig up some nostalgia?”

“Cole, I’m not tryin-”

“It doesn’t matter that you’re trying to do, it’s what you’re actually doing. I came into this with the hopes it wouldn’t be just a harsh reminder of what once was, but your body language is telling me I was very much in the right to assume there was something more to this.”

I was subdued down to silence, I should have been a bit more cautious with the way I approached this interaction; it was wrong of me to assume that there wouldn't be some kickback to my plan.

“Cole I’m just trying to bring all this to an end, doesn’t it eat away at you too? The way everything went down, it just doesn’t make sense.”

“I think it makes perfect sense, John. Derrick was sick. He was so sick in-fact he used to ramble on about people in his house telling him to kill people or steal things. He was totally fucked in the head man, and Mikey was the casualty of his parent’s negligence.”

“Why did he wait so long to do something so crazy then? There must have been countless times where he and Mikey were alone where he could do something if he really wanted to.”

Cole stood up with his hands on the desk, leaning in with a scrunched up face portraying great frustration.

“You’re trying to apply logic to something that is devoid of it! There’s not some deeper subtext to his actions, he was just fucked up beyond recognition. The world might not be black and white John, but the ink on the page sure as hell is.”

“Listen to yourself Cole, you’re coping right now. You’ve gotten so comfortable with looking past what’s right in front of you! It’s all right there, but you became complacent, so you didn’t have to dig deeper.”

“I see exactly what is right in front of me, it’s a ghost from my past who’s only here to rattle me a little. This isn’t a fairytale, Jonathan, this is the real world. There isn’t always a hero who solves the mystery, there isn’t even always a mystery, why can’t you just leave well enough alone?”

“How the fuck can I leave it alone, if it’s always there when the lights go off?”

I hadn’t realized it, but I, too, had jumped to my feet; my heart rate was totally unregulated. The painful thud of my heart against my chest cavity had caused me to stagger back and brace myself against the back of the chair I was formerly sitting on.

“John.. “

I placed a hand up. “I’m fine, just- I’m sorry I came, I think I’d jumped to a lot of conclusions before today. Hell, I jumped to a lot of conclusions before I stepped foot around here. It’s selfish, but I need to find my closure somehow, Cole. It’s eating me totally alive, I don’t have anything definitive on it but I know there’s something out there… If I can just get my hands on the maps for the powerlines by the neighborhood, I can find the answers.”

“There’s nothing out there, John…”

“How can you know? You weren’t there with us when we-”

“Saw him?”

The paralysis was sharp and sudden. I couldn’t rip my eyes away from him even if I wanted to. As if Cole was the man himself, I had been frozen solid in his gaze. 

“It’s funny to hear how similar the way you two talked about it. The thin man in the woods. He’d been consumed by his guilt for not mentioning it to anyone that night, just as I’m sure you didn’t either.”

“How can you know that I saw it too?” That was all I could lamely rebut.

“Look at yourself, you’re like a little kid who just got caught lying to your parents for the first time. The only way you could have been in so much turmoil over that night is if you felt like you withheld important information from the police. I had my suspicions Justin was hiding something when he started trying to find answers all on his own.

He sat back down and released a long, measured breath.

“Did he?”

“Justin never was able to find what he was looking for, and it drove him out of town. College was well and good but, when he was twenty two he came home again for a few months while he scanned the job market. Each day he grew a little closer to whatever he was looking for, because by the time a month had passed, he went off into those woods and was basically impossible to reach from sun-up to sun-down.”

“What’d he find?”

“Jack shit, John. He didn’t find a goddamn thing like I assumed. I mean, it’s just hundreds of acres of woods totally uninterrupted by residential or commercial property. What could he possibly have found in a single day without any maps? He didn’t even know *what* he was looking for.”

There was a permeable tension that suffocated us both for a long few moments, and Cole’s voice sliced through the air quickly.

“Do yourself a favor, John. Go see someone you love, and find your grip on reality.” He’d walk over to me and give me a very tight squeeze of a hug. “It was good to see you, but you gotta move on. Don’t give away any more of your life to this place, if you were meant to stay here forever, you would have never left to begin with.”

“I… I’d gotten so caught up in the heat of the past handful of months I didn’t realize just how much stretching I was doing to make it all make sense.” Did I believe that? I mean, at the moment Cole had presented me with so much evidence against what I’d taken as gospel until this point, how could I deny it?

“I think I’m gonna go see my mom tomorrow and head home early on Friday. I haven’t seen her in a while.”

“Come on, dude, you’ve left your mom hanging like that?”

“The relationship got a little bit strained over the years.” I chuckled lightly, which was met with presumably a pity chuckle from Cole.

“I get it, I think we all had a pretty turbulent home life in that final stretch of living with our parents.”

“It was nice to see you, Cole.”

“You too, John, do yourself a favor and let yourself be John the adult now. You don’t have to spend the rest of your life being Teenage John playing Man-Hunt. It sounds like you’ve let that chapter go on a little too long.”

I had nothing to add to that, offering him a gentle nod, and walking to my car. As I walked away I sent a text out to my mom, seeing what the future held for me.

Seeing the character actually adjust to how I talk is way more satisfying than jumping straight into the spicy script.

1p824tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1p824tv/firm_tight_review_the_lowimpact_resistance_band/,Firm & Tight Review 🎯 The Low-Impact Resistance Band Program That Left Us Feeling Stronger and Leaner,"# 💡 Welcome ...

Let’s be honest - some days, the idea of a 60-minute workout sounds as tempting as assembling IKEA furniture with no instructions.

You’re tired. You’re stiff. You want those **quick at-home workouts for busy women** that don't require a motivational speech from your cat.

Most of us are just looking for **ways to tone muscle without lifting weights**, preferably while still in last night's hoodie.

And let’s not pretend we’re signing up for pain - we want moves that feel good, deliver results, and won’t send us crawling into an ice bath.

That’s where the [Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts](https://theworldhealth.org/firm-and-tight-official) come in. They promise gentle intensity, smart routines, and targeted strength - all with a few stretchy loops and a bit of floor space.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name**: Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts  
**Category**: Fitness ➝ Resistance Band Workouts  
**Overall Verdict**: 4.6/5

# 🧰 What’s Inside the Firm & Tight Mini Band Workouts?

You get 7 different workouts ranging from **full-body mini band workout routines** to short recovery sessions. These focus on **mini band workouts that hit the core and glutes**, upper body, lower body, and even mobility.

The format? Choose digital or DVD. Or grab the bundle with their **top resistance bands for full-body toning** \- which feel sturdier than those cheap ones that snap mid-lunge and threaten your eyebrows.

If you're **doing a Firm & Tight mini band session**, expect it to be short, effective, and sneakily challenging. You’ll move through **bodyweight exercises using resistance bands** that fire up muscles you didn’t even know existed.

# 🔍 What Makes It Different?

The star here is their **Targeted Triple Toning method**, built to **activate stabilizer muscles during** regular **home workouts**. We're talking balance, posture, and subtle strength gains.

This isn’t about dramatic, sweaty bootcamps. Instead, you’ll feel [muscles wake up slowly](https://theworldhealth.org/firm-and-tight-official), in that “Oh wow, my hips are actually working” kind of way.

These **resistance band workouts that target deeper muscles** feel different. They work from the inside out, building real strength and improving how you move - not just how you look in leggings.

# 🎯 Who’s It Best For?

Firm & Tight is ideal for anyone interested in **beginner-friendly resistance training at home**. No gym. No yelling. Just smart movement and good vibes.

It’s perfect for those managing injury recovery, hormonal shifts, or frankly just sick of high-impact hell. The **low-impact routines to tone your whole body** here feel more like physical therapy's fun cousin.

You’ll especially love this if you’re tired of chasing “beast mode” and instead want **strength training without any equipment** that leaves you feeling better, not broken.

# 🔄 Real Results and What to Expect

Give it a few weeks and you’ll notice **improving posture and definition with** these **home workouts** that don’t rely on cardio marathons. Your core gets tighter. Your glutes firm up.

And your knees... stop complaining.

Many users report that the **workouts help build lean muscle**, especially in the hips, thighs, and shoulders. There’s a surprising amount of burn packed into 20 minutes.

You’re not going to bulk up overnight, but you will feel stronger, walk taller, and **using resistance bands**, those **exercises that define** real **muscle** become easier by week four.

# 👯 Our Experience Using Firm & Tight (Told by My Friend Sierra)

My friend Sierra-  a barre instructor who used to work with me on that short-lived wellness podcast we attempted during lockdown *-* is the one who first nudged me to [try Firm & Tight](https://theworldhealth.org/firm-and-tight-official).

She’s one of those people who somehow manages to look graceful while doing squat pulses, which, frankly, should be illegal.

Sierra had been using the program for a few weeks between teaching classes and doing virtual workshops.

She told me, *“It’s my go-to when I want something that challenges me but doesn’t wreck my knees.”*

Intrigued, I joined her for a session one Sunday afternoon, and we did the **Upper Body Shape** routine right in her sunroom with her dog snoring under the coffee table.

What surprised me was how effective it felt, even though the movements looked simple. The **bodyweight exercises using resistance bands** had my shoulders burning by the halfway mark - but in that satisfying, slow-burn way.

Sierra swore by the **Targeted Triple Toning method**, and I could see why.

My arms felt engaged in a whole new way, like I’d finally woken up muscles that had been on nap mode for years.

The only thing Sierra wished was different? She wanted the option to stream the workouts directly from her smart TV - using her laptop was fine, but not ideal during full-body floor work.

Still, she’s kept it in rotation weekly because it balances perfectly with her more intense barre classes, and it gives her **low-impact strength routines** that don’t take all day.

# ⭐ Star Ratings Breakdown

* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Workout Quality** The workouts are clear, simple, and effective. You’ll identify some of those **overlooked muscles with resistance bands** after [just one session](https://theworldhealth.org/firm-and-tight-official).
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Ease of Use** Navigation is okay, though not ideal for TV streaming. Still a good fit for **home workouts using mini bands**.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Effectiveness** You’ll see and feel progress, especially in strength and tone. **Toning your arms and thighs without weights** actually happens.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ **Variety** Seven well-rounded sessions, though a few more advanced options would add more range.
* ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Value for Money** It’s a one-time buy, and you’re getting a full, detailed **resistance band plan for toning muscles** with no hidden fees.

**Average Rating: 4.6/5**

The dry aroma was fruity and had very rich dark chocolate notes.

Here’s what I did:

Inverted Aeropress
10g coffee, 12 clicks on C3s
150ml water, around 2 mins off boil
Bloom with ~60-70ml for 30 sec and stir 8 times
Then added the rest of the water, another 7-8 stirs
Steep till 1:55, flip and swirl gently then plunge slowly at 2:20.


The cup was quite good. Got that apple-juice like acidity, some nutty undertones and a long lingering aftertaste. But I feel like this coffee has a lot more potential and I can get a much better cup out of it with a better recipe.

Would love to hear how others are brewing Curveball or any tips for brewing Excelsa in general.",1,1764249860.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

problem is she tends to wake up before the timer is set to start brewing and would like to somehow control it by her phone so she could wake up and then cue the coffeemaker to begin brewing

now if she sets the timer earlier - that doesn’t necessarily work either; she’ll sleep in and then wake up to stale coffee

now i brought over a smart plug to try and we plugged the coffee maker in. the issue with this trial was that when we pressed the brew button, followed by turning off the coffee maker via the smart plug… when we turned it back on - the coffee maker’s “start brew” was not active. as if it forgot that it was supposed to brew while it was turned off

She moved to America at the beginning of high school, and I am natively born here. The feeling I get is so strongg. I have known her for 1 month and we have worked together on a project prepping for 2 big events for some clubs we are in. She has called me things lie the nicest, laughed with me over stuff, and I don't know my heart just flutters whenever I see her for the first time in a bit or think of her. Just the last time we met to get some errands done for the club, and I asked her how many friends she has. She responded: ""Not many, just my female friends who speak the same language as me, but you are my first guy friend"". I almost didn't believe those words she said, maybe it's because I think I never had what it takes. I don't really know if I became her friend if I like her or because I want to be friends with her, I think it's both. We've also worked together by luck since we got paired up by the clubs to prep for events..

I noticed she seems to be comftorable with physical touch. When I was growing up I didn't get much of that from my family or anything, so even her just tapping me on the shoulder once sent butterflies into my stomach. I've also seen her put her hand around others back, and lean on the shoulder of someone. So I'm trying to focus on being open to more base-line touch like just an appropiate light sweep on the hand when handing something, or a tap to signifiy something, I am not really used to that stuff so yea. Honestly sometimes I kind of wonder if I fall into the ""nice guy"" category. I have been pretty competant with the club work, presenting in front of people confidently, and stuff like that. I think I act nice out of genuine forgiveness or care for anyone I do things for, but with her I am not going to lie it's also a bit because I want good chances, which maybe is a bit disengenous but that's natural.

I've just never had a girlfriend before and I am deathly afraid around crushes I get, but this time I feel more confident, and I am ok with whatever happens. If she doesn't romantically like me back even a bit that's alright, that's her choice as a person and respecting that is the wisest and safest choice, since I do not existentially need her, I am a full adult on my own. I don't want to introduce discomfort... I was thinking of asking her out for some coffee when we get back from Thanksgiving break. I can still be friend with her plotonically. I probably think about her for hours a day at this rate, it's a pretty time-consuming thing. In fact I've had to intentionally intervene my focus by going to the gym or getting off my phone/computer and stop looking stuff up about crushes (pretty harmful habit lol), just so I can still live a productive life. I'm also a bit behind on school work and that is easily my top priority, not my crush.

I am also in therapy and have talked about this with my therapist, about anxious attachment, etc. I think my biggest struggle is fearing rejection and getting distracted in my daily tasks when I think about her all the time.

I wanna be more confident. Any advice, thoughts, or encouragements?",2,1764249521.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False

So I presume this is quite a popular machine, so maybe somebody has faced a similar issue. I just got one a week ago, have a scale, I always weigh my grounds and coffee output, as well as time the shots and weight the espresso as it extracts.

The problem is, one day the shots suddenly started to take way too long. I didn’t mess with the burr, my grind setting was at 6, 17,8 grams in, 38 grams out, 25 seconds shot, tasted great.

Now it’s 17,8 grams in, 15 grams out in 25 seconds at best, sometimes shots even stall.

I did start using a different coffee, but it’s the same roast darkness and roughly the same roast date (Nov 12th). Still pulled a couple great shots with the new one.

I used bottled water, pull 3-4 shots a day max, clean everything that needs to be cleaned.

What’s the course of action here? What can be the problem? Should try the same coffee I used the last time, descale if the issue isn’t resolved and then contact the manufacturer?",1,1764249465.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

Not from anxiety but from this weird mix of relief and exhaustion . I have spent so many years trying to be the smallest version of myself so that people around me would not feel threatened or annoyed or overwhelmed. I tried to be the quiet girl in  every conversation, the understanding one, the patient one, the one who never complains, the one who always absorbs everyone else’s chaos like a sponge. And I thought it made me kind . Turns out it mostly made me invisible.   
A few weeks ago I decided to stop apologizing for existing . Not in some dramatic way but in small everyday choices. I stopped laughing softly when I wanted  to laugh loudly. I stopped saying “it’s fine” when it wasn’t. I let myself disagree. I let myself take up space without immediately shrinking afterward. And the reaction from people  around me was so different than I had expected. Some backed away a bit but the ones who stayed started treating me like a full person instead of a background character. It felt strange at  first, like wearing clothes that are too big, but then it started fitting.   
The moment it clicked was today when I  looked at my reflection in the microwave door and I didn’t feel that tiny pinch of shame for being “too much”. I just saw myself. Not a softened version, not a minimized one.  I wish I could explain how freeing that felt. Maybe someone here needs that reminder too. You don’t have to be tiny  to be loved. You don’t have to disappear to be accepted. Sometimes being seen is the first step to feeling safe again.",20,1764249295.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,0.92,False

1p81x16,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p81x16,[Rum Review #198] Siglo XX Antiguo,"A few months ago, a friend who goes by the name ""Rum Ambassador"" on social media contacted me. He asked if I'd like to try a new rum that hadn't been released yet and if they could send it to me. Of course, I said yes. At the same time, a friend who lives in Cumaná wrote to me, offering me a sample of this new Siglo XX rum, which also hadn't been released yet. I said yes to him too. Eventually, everything arrived, and they were all the same bottle (three in total). Not bad for a sample, I think.

This rum is made by Licorería La Florida, the same company that makes the Siglo XX Reserva Especial that I [reviewed last March](https://www.reddit.com/r/rum/comments/1j4w1vs/rum_review_125_siglo_xx_reserva_especial/). This time, they launched a new product under the Siglo XX brand to celebrate the company's 75th anniversary, as it was founded in 1948.

It's worth noting that the Siglo XX Reserva Especial has a formula that was created at the beginning of the 20th century, hence its name. But the formula for this Antiguo seems to be something new. All I know about it is that the minimum age is 5 years and the maximum is 8 years, and like the other presentation, the blend is not aimed at a specific age but rather at a particular flavor.

Made by: Licorería La Florida  
Name of the rum: Antiguo  
Brand: Siglo XX  
Origin: Venezuela  
Age: 5 to 8 years

Nose  
On the nose, the first thing I encounter is a chemical note that reminds me of pencil eraser, but there are also aromas of brown sugar, caramel, and black fruit, and finally some soft notes of cocoa nibs.

Palate  
On the palate, the 40% is barely noticeable, but what I appreciate most are notes of caramel, coffee grounds, toffee, and a hint of marzipan, or rather like an unsweetened almond paste.

Retrohale/Finish  
Hazelnuts and a hint of caramel, but it feels burnt.

Rating  
6 on the t8ke

Conclusion  
Although the flavors of this Siglo XX Antiguo are distinct and certainly pleasant, it lacks mixability. In other words, I struggle to find an ideal way to enjoy it that highlights its flavors. It works well neat, and even with an ice cube in it, but its use in cocktails seems to emphasize a bitter note. I haven't actually tried it in every cocktail, but I think it's an interesting rum to experiment with in different ways until I find the perfect combination.

I usually post in Spanish on my networks, so if this review sounds translated, it's because it is.

I dont know what to do anymore. I feel alone in this partnership. I love him dearly but he's just not here. I don't mean physically because he's here ALL the time but in presence. We split finances 50/50... he does help around the house.  But I just don't see him as an active contributing presence to the family. We have sex weekly. And it's good. But I don't feel like we are in this together. There us no care, foresight, celebration, interest. No joy or fun. Just function. We are kind to each other.

I felt like we had to split because it was me that was holding the energetic and emotional load of the family. Him included and it was too much. I'm exhausted. It would always be me starting conversations; checking in on him; organising activities for connection. I was always leaving myself to meet him emotionally. He never comes to me.

I told him this...he said he didn't know what to say.

Today I got another job decline from a sparkly new role in my company. I had a lot invested in this. I'm gutted and really upset. I told him I need care today... he got me a coffee, gave me an obligatory hug and left me to cry on my own. 

I just feel totally alone. He can't share his feelings, dreams or wishes. I asked him what he thought we'd be like as on old couple. He said he never thinks about it. We can't plan anything because there is no appetite from him.

When we 1st met. I thought I shouldn't be so needy...you know self empowerment and all. As long as I love myself and dedicate to the mystery of universal love I'd be OK. But I see how I've ended up with an emotionally absent man. He lacks the depth that I so freely swim in. I feel so alone...

Use case is watching movies/motorsports after dinner and some casual splitscreen gaming with friends.
Target Image is 110–120″ (16:9)
I'd like a somewhat bright image even with some ambient light, after some research I figured I should aim for ~2000+ ANSI lumens or more, is this feasible or am I completely off?

Room Setup is:
Room depth: 3.90 m
Seating: ~2.2 m from screen wall
Projector: ceiling mount or coffee table
Wall: beige paint (no screen yet, maybe later)
Can go full dark thanks to full-size window shutters.

Starting budget is around €450 but could stretch slightly for good deals.
Are any of these worth it? Or should I be looking at something else entirely?

Secondly, since the wall behind the couch has a window, I'll have to either install a ceiling mount or put the projector on a moving stand. Suggestions?",1,1764248960.0,budgetprojectors,0,1.0,False

But I was walking back to my bike after having a coffee on the beach and I saw a guy on an MT-07 with someone on the back pull right up next to my bike in a pretty big car park that had loads of other space. As I got closer was obviously in their view he then reversed the bike back and parked it a bit further away.

Gave him a nod as you do then I set off, but I couldn’t help feeling a little bit sick that if I hadn’t come back at that moment I did I might not have had a bike to come back to.

Could easily have just been a nice guy thinking I’ll park where the other bike has, but it’s also the most worried I’ve ever been that someone was thinking about stealing my bike 🫤.

For context, I have lived in a different city from the one I grew up in for the last 4.5 years because of university, but I occasionally stay for days or weeks at a time at my parents' house. 

About 7 years ago, I started hanging out with one of my high school classmates (Apricot, 23, he/him). We didn’t have much in common, but we are probably both some kind of neurodivergent (in my country low-needs neurodivergent people rarely get diagnosed) so we hit it off well enough and we had (in my eyes) that sort of friendship which is limited to a shared experience (school) and not much else. 

In Summer 2021, after we graduated high school, we went on a trip of a few days together with a shared friend (Cherry, 23, she/her). On the last day he asked me out, the last chance he had since we were probably not going to see each other in the near future because of uni. I politely declined, saying I only considered him a friend (also for context: he doesn’t know I am non-binary). 

In the following years he sometimes texted me random stuff (memes mostly) and I always replied but I never texted him myself. As time went by, he kind of stopped texting me. 

Last September I was at a coffee shop in my hometown, and I bumped into his mum. She has always been the one pushing us to be friends and spend more time together even in the past (sometimes I felt forced to hang out with him because I felt bad and I didn’t want to be rude), so evidently she immediately told Apricot I was in town and had him text me to organise a meet up. 

The next day we met up at the same coffee shop and caught up on the things we did in the previous four years we had not been in touch, but it was really awkward because we were never close friends so the superficial stuff we could talk about went by quickly and, given that we never had common interests, I didn’t really know how to keep the conversation going and he has never been good at context clues and socialising so I felt like the onus was mainly on me. 

When it was finally over and we parted ways, he told me to text him the next time I was in town to meet up, but I honestly started thinking about it and the truth is that I don’t want to. I have started going to therapy and doing things for other people’s comfort is one of the things I’m working on. I think that hanging out again would make me uncomfortable and I really do not see a future in this (platonic) relationship nor do I particularly care (if I were to think only about my feelings and not his). 

So my question is, during the incoming Winter holidays when I will go back to my hometown, WIBTD if I didn’t text Apricot even though he asked me to the last time we saw each other?

I honestly don’t know if it would be rude/selfish of me to not text him and I would appreciate any advice on this situation. I also considered involving Cherry in the meetup to try and make it less awkward, but I think it may be weird because I haven’t talked to her in years and I don’t want to possibly make her uncomfortable as well. ",2,1764248788.0,1800Drama,2,1.0,False

It's so annoying when periods do this. A couple of months ago it was late a week so I took a test since my fiancé and I have compatible bits and aren't opposed to having kids (actually we kinda want them after we marry) but it arrived the next time I went to to bathroom after the test ofc.

I'm pretty sure I'm not pregnant and my period is coming soon but tell that to my anxiety. I've also had a lot of energy drinks this month so if there's a mini us in there I feel bad and worry about miscarrying it. I'm planning on quitting caffeine completely when we're trying for real as caffeine increases the risk or early pregnancy miscarriages and lowers birth weight. I'm also convinced it causes immunity in the child if you consume a lot of it while pregnant because my mom had A LOT of caffeine when she was carrying me, both in coffee and in headache medicine and I don't get affected by caffeine. I just drink it because it's tasty. If I ever am so lucky as to have child I want it to get as good of a life as I possibly can starting off by giving it the best time getting 3D printed that I can.

At the same time I'm also freaking out because I was very sure I wanted to be child-free before I met my fiancé so I don't know how I'll be a good parent. What if it inherits my autoimmunity? My poor mental health? I'll probably get post partum depression too and I worry how that's gonna affect the child. Thankfully I know its dad will be great and pick up where I can't but every child deserves two good parents. Since I'll be involved my actions are gonna matter. I'm not just an egg donor and 3D printer.

Some things to note: Luxury massage, spa and facial are out as I have already booked her a full treatment at a place she has been talking about going to, but never has, for months. We have also spent some time shopping together upgrading her wardrobe significantly 

Some things I know she wants: high quality, flattering pyjamas - anti ageing or great facial/skin care products - she recently started wearing make up (or more of it) and has spoken about getting a few quality pieces but doesn’t know where to start 

Some things I want to avoid: anything linked to chores, work or other draining task - jewellery

Things she likes: coffee, baths, kids (we have a 2 year old and a 4 year old), family time, walks, girls nights, being cozy and comfortable, opportunities to wear some of her nicer clothes

Budget: looking to spend somewhere between $200 and $600 total

Location: Australia 

Current ideas: cute pyjama set (papinelle, home bodii, or similar brand), I’ve been eyeing off some face treatment solutions and overnight creams, silk pillow cases or high quality sheets.

1p81kx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/G101SafeHaven/comments/1p81kx7/things_im_unthankful_for_at_thanksgiving/,Things I'm Un-Thankful for at Thanksgiving,"What better time than the day we give thanks for all we have than to list all the things the Giants do to make me un-thankful.  I say ""all""; but I can't possibly list every one and still have time to cook the turkey.  But it is 7:00 AM, I am visiting friends, everyone is still in bed, and I'm on my 5th cup of coffee, so I will jot down a few:

1. The Giants so-called medical staff.  Since Denver we've reeled off 5 additional losses.  Adebo went down in or around the 3rd Q in the Denver game and has been out ever since. He's obviously hurt pretty badly and yet he's not on IR.  Who is making these decisions and based on what criteria?  And then there is Dexter Lawrence.  It's been a year since he dislocated his elbow and missed the balance of the '24 season.  He hasn't looked like himself all year.  We guessed and guessed and guessed why, many of us speculating that the elbow was not fully healed and thus he was sapped of strength and unable to condition properly.  Now, with just 5 games left we hear it is injury hangover and his snaps need to be managed to get him through a game, even managed to the extreme of keeping him off the field when he is needed most.  Why is he still playing in a lost season?  The fact that there is no other DT on the team is no excuse.  If he's that impaired and the outcome of the final 5 games that meaningless, why are they risking him further.  Sit the guy.  Then there is Jaxson Dart.  They watch him run himself into the blue tent game after game after game and think nothing of it, and now he's week three into concussion protocol.  This finally looks like the correct decision as he appears for the moment like the Giants' best hope for a competitive future.  But when he was hit and knocked out on the field, he wasn't sent back to his second home - the medical tent - or even removed immediately from the game.  No, he was allowed to resume play only to be so obviously concussed that 2 plays later he was removed for a month and counting.  Who is the medical staff - rhetorical Ronnie Barnes - and what are their qualifications?; because from the outside looking in they sure look incompetent.  Lord knows the things that go on that we never see.  

2. Roster Management.  Why are Neal and Hyatt still on the roster when they never play and never contribute?  Again a rhetorical question because we know it is Joe Schoen trying to make some stupid statistical argument to justify his performance - ""look how many of my draft picks are still on the roster.""  And what about the practice squad?  Why is Turbo Miller taking up a spot when it is clear they never intend to elevate him?  Eric Gray?   Eric the fumbler?  Why?  Why the stupid PS signings of Ray-Ray McCloud and his ilk when you could have simply elevated Lil-Jordan who at least was here since camp?  What has Ray-Ray provided that has been valuable?  

3. The Cap.  How on earth can this franchise have the worst record since 2013 and never have any cap space?  Again, rhetorical.  It is because Schoen can't draft and has to plug holes with over-paid, second rate talent, to fill all the myriad holes Schoen created by releasing the few truly good players Gettleman left behind.

4. Why are we running back the ""fire the flailing head coach but keeping the flailing GM"" approach we tried in 2015 and 2019?  Why is the definition of insanity in the Oxford English Dictionary animated with a Mara family photo, and nobody gets the point?  

5.  Why are we allowing a GM whose job may not be secure to lead the coaching search?  See Mara Family Photo!

6. Why are we looking at aging coaches long past whatever prime they had simply because they once had success with far better rosters, or in some cases no success at all, but they just did it once?

7. Why did we build the worst stadium in the league and cover it with the worst surface available?

8. Why do we tolerate the Jets in our house?

9. Why do the Mara's have so many heirs?

10. Why are we the only team in the NFL who can't find a placekicker?

11. Why will we decide to make Kafka & Bullen the 2026 HC & DC if the Giants if the Giants manage to defeat a hobbled Washington team, a JJ McCan'tPlayQB led Viking squad, and the worst Raiders roster ever fielded led by an old, re-tread HC who once had success with a different team years ago?

12. Why am I a Giants fan after watching this shite for 59 years?  

  
Happy Thanksgiving everyone.  Give thanks for all you have in life but never stop asking why!!

I wanted to thank them for something that I noticed during the whole tariff mess that seriously drove up coffee prices.

My coffee habit used to be between Rose Rock if I'm being bougie, but if I was trying to be cheap, I'd hit up Dunkin' (where a bag was about $8).

Then the tariffs hit. Dunkin’ went all the way to $13 or higher, and I figured they must've been huffing glue or something because they didn't do the same thing; they just passed it on to the consumer.

It made Rose Rock the more sensible option, which has always been a premium price point because it's a local and smaller operation.

What stood out for me was that Rose Rock never raised their price, not even one cent, over those months we were all paying more. They just ate the cost.

When I called to thank them and let them know their decision wasn't unnoticed (because that kind of business integrity is important!), I found out the whole thing is run by one gentleman nearing 60. 

He hires college students part-time for help. 

His father started the place, and now that his parents have passed, it's just him. 

He made the conscious decision to absorb the tariff costs, hoping to gain market share by staying accessible.

For this to be successful, it has to pay off for him. So I'm doing my part and letting y'all know.

That's how I feel, anyway.

If you are an Oklahoman who genuinely likes to support local businesses with real integrity, please consider Rose Rock.

Christopher's interactive fractalverse novella ""Unity"" has been recast as a linear story and is being printed in the Dragonsteel Nexus 2025 *Grimoire* anthology. [Unity is the longest story in this collection, taking up 60 pages in print.](https://i.imgur.com/RkNONP3.png)

This anthology was previously available to [preorder online with shipping](https://grimoakpress.com/products/grimoire-a-grim-oak-press-anthology-for-dragonsteel-nexus-2025), but those copies have sold out. The remaining stock will be available for sale in person at Dragonsteel, and are expected to sell out on the first day of the convention, December 4th. The ebook edition of this anthology will be available for purchase on that same date.

In addition to recasting the story into a linear format, some other tweaks were made for this edition to improve or add to the story. (see below)

# Updates about [the interactive online version of the story](https://fractalverse.net/works/unity/).

A few months ago, around the time that Grimoire was first announced, the website version of Unity had acquired a few bugs making it unplayable, and it was temporarily hidden.

Those bugs have since all been fixed, and the website now not only works again, but also features two other major improvements:

**New Illustrations**

Back in 2023 Christopher and his team commissioned a number of illustrations for a planned coffee table book edition of Unity. That book ended up being canceled, but the artwork can now be seen on the website as part of the story.

Some of these illustrations appear on multiple pages, in which case I'm just linking here the first page they appear.

**Text Edits**

As mentioned, some changes and improvements were made for Grimoire. Some of those edits are concerned with making the story linear, and thus are exclusive to Grimoire. The others have been incorporated into the online edition as well.

Most of the edits are fairly small. Tweaks in wording to improve style or continuity, to avoid repetition, or to emphasize different things. In at least one instance a description of character's outfit was changed to reflect the illustration added. There are three changes though that go a little bit further:

In the below excerpts, **bold text** is newly added, and ~~striked through~~ text has since been removed.


**1. Echo's Aunt's Gyroscope**

On the ""Leave Hokusai"" page, where you get your first look at Unity, three short exposition bits were added that reminds the reader of Unity, the events of To Sleep, and the Caretakers. This has makes the novella easier to read for someone who either hasn't read To Sleep or no longer remembers it. Perhaps the most interesting part of this is a comparison made to a gyroscope gift that the main character is said to have previously received.

> The Hokusai docks with a barely perceptible shudder. Outside the airlock window, a patch of green appears. Curious, you crane your neck **and see what looks like the gyroscope your aunt gave you for Christmas one year: large equatorial ring, four cardinal arms reaching up and down toward the poles, and all of it built out of metals and composites and the most unlikely material one might encounter in space—green, leafy plants.** Unity . . . The living space station grown/build/made by whatever the hell Kira Navárez had become **following her defeat of the Nightmares and their monstrous progenitor, the Maw. She had saved all of humanity by it. Saved the Jellies too. Which was why the Jellies had made peace with us following the death of the Maw.**

> Down the concourse, following the directions on your overlays. Near the walls, several of the station Caretakers skitter along, carrying what looks to be an electrical cable of some sort. The lead Caretaker has its feathered frill raised, like a rooster’s comb.  
> **You eye them, suspicious. The Caretakers are supposed to be benign enough—their primary concern seems to be tending the station—but you’ve been burned enough times that you can’t help but wonder at their trustworthiness.**  
> A fork in the concourse . . . you study your directions.

**2. A Pair of Marines**

Two new interactions are added with regards to a new pair of Marines. In your first meeting with Rohyamar (""Go to Ambassador"") she now tells you that a pair of Marines were the first to find Umesh's body.

> And without Navárez or the Seed to help us, things could get very ugly, very fast.”  
> **“Who found him?”**  
> **“A pair of Marines on watch.”**  
> **“But no one was around at time of death?”**  
> **“Not that we know of.”**  
> “Surely the station mind saw what happened.”  

And then a few pages later (""Examine Crime Scene""), you talk to these two marines.

> A close look at Umesh’s body doesn’t tell you anything new. He got smashed, and he got smashed hard.

Also, the tone of the initial interaction with Rohyamar is shifted a bit, with two new additions to the exchange. You're now the one to force Rohyamar to directly request your help and grant you authorization. And it's established that you're not actually required to help her.

> Rohyamar gives a dismissive wave of her hand. “Yes, but the station mind isn’t particularly helpful, to put it lightly. You’ll see when you read their communiqué.”  
> “Uh-huh. And ~~you want me to look into Umesh's death? Is that what I'm hearing Ma'am?~~**why are you telling me all this, Ma’am? I’m here to work as a management officer. Nothing more.” You know the answer, but you want to hear her say it.**  
> **She eyes you with uncomfortable directness, as if she’s evaluating every part of you.** “~~Exactly.~~ I looked at your record, Specialist. Four years in the Martian PDF. Excellent marks all around. Transferred to the UMCM, served as a criminal investigator in the Security Forces for another six years. Saw combat during the recent conflict. Honorable discharge two months ago, followed by acceptance to the Diplomatic Core.” She raises an eyebrow. “Did I miss anything?”  
> “No, Ma’am.”  
> A satisfied nod. “You’re the closest thing to a proper law enforcement officer-slash-detective we have on the station at the moment. So whether or not you feel up to it, investigating Umesh’s death is on you, Specialist.”  
> **You could say no. You’re under no legal obligation to help, but under the circumstance, refusal is hardly an option. Besides, you know your duty. There’s just one thing you have to be sure of: “Will you give me authorization to act in an official capacity? No strings attached?”**  
> **The ambassador doesn’t hesitate: “I will.”**  
> **That’s what you were hoping for. “Alright. I’ll do it.”**  
> **Rohyamar relaxes ever so slightly. You realize she was worried about your answer. “Good.** Let me impress on you again the importance of this assignment. The situation couldn’t be any more volatile. Discretion is of the highest importance. If word of this gets out, the whole peace treaty could be shot to hell.”  
> “I understand.”  
> Another, sharper, nod. “~~Good.~~ I’m giving you full access to the staff here. All our resources are at your disposal. Whatever you need, you have it. Now get some AcuWake in you, and head over to the Jelly quarters. They’re waiting for you.”",1,1764248035.0,Fractalverse,1,1.0,False

I feel like it's easier to find common ground through explaining. So here I am. Looking for my match to find a girlfriend online and want a deep meaningful connection for someone. We can start off as friends, get to know each other to see where things take us if it works out in the long-term but no pressure.

In life I only value few things. From good friends to loved ones thankfully I have them, and a relationship which unfortunately have not gotten to experience yet or anything similar. I've always been single and liked it. But sometimes the quiet moments are just too much to sit through. I've made some attempts on this sub and led me to some pretty cool and interesting girls but obviously it's been discouraging nothing stuck, so I'm giving it another try.

Hopefully we can grow together and inevitably fall in love with. I'm up for any kinds of dates whether its movie and coffee or fun sponty dates what works best for me, hopefully the same goes for you, if you seem to be the right one who's also looking to try out new things feel free to send a message, my dm's are open if your interested!

These choreographed “blackouts” and “no-shop days” are not movements, they are tantrums. Worse, they are tantrums rooted in a catastrophic misunderstanding of what causes prices to rise, how markets function, and what actually drives improvements in living standards.

The central fiction animating these protests is the idea that prices are set by a shadowy cabal of greedy firms, and that abstaining from consumption -- moreover, briefly and often symbolically -- will somehow teach businesses a lesson. It’s a risible, comic-book conception. Prices have risen over the past half-decade because the Federal Reserve flooded the financial system with trillions of dollars during 2020–2021; because the Federal government spent hand over fist; because regulatory constraints froze supply in housing, healthcare, and energy even as demand surged; because tariffs have raised input costs across global supply chains; and because state and local governments shut down production capacity and labor markets for months on end. Prices increased for both producers and consumers because the underlying structure of costs shifted upward.",1,1764247707.0,UsaNewsLive,0,1.0,False

As soon as the morning light coated the town robot's metallic contours in the first touch of warmth, it

began gathering every story you brought.

We stil remember the first time we saw the room designs you shared our whole team gathered around

the computer, grinning from ear to ear. Some of you turned your litle houses into cat cafés, while others

transformed living rooms into stages. At that moment, we truly felt that the town exists because of you.

Now, three months have passed, and the town has welcomed 150,000 builders! Thank you all for

your love and support.

Moving forward, we will continue to fix bugs and optimize the game. Beyond the usual fixes, brand-new

content is in the works, some lively little characters are eager to meet you in December!

Meanwhile, localization is also speeding up, with Korean and Spanish versions in production. We hope

friends from around the world can come to the town for a cup of coffee or a little furniture arrangement.

In the future, besides more stories and furniture, we plan to explore Mod support, allowing everyone to

visit each other's homes, create their own furniture, and share their creative designs.

The town could never have grown without your company. Our team is small-fewer than ten people-so

updates may take some time, but every step we take is made with care and dedication.

Once again, thank you to every single town builder. Your shared room designs and words of

encouragement bring the town to life and give us the motivation to keep moving forward.

1p81cse,https://workdaymagazine.org/it-restores-my-faith-in-humanity-why-minnesota-workers-are-joining-the-starbucks-strike/,“It Restores My Faith in Humanity”: Why Minnesota Workers Are Joining the Starbucks Strike,"Meg Davitch works at a Starbucks in Chanhassen, Minn., because she loves making coffee, and loves the barista community. “We’re on strike because we’re sick of them stonewalling us and not coming to the table,” she said at a rally hosted by Starbucks Workers United on November 13 outside the St. Anthony store. “We really care about getting this contract signed.”

It has been almost two weeks since November 13, when more than 1,000 workers represented by Starbucks Workers United kicked off an open-ended nationwide unfair labor practice (ULP) strike at over 65 stores across the United States. The charges allege bad faith bargaining, unilateral policy changes, and retaliatory firings and discipline. This is the longest ULP strike in the company’s history. 

Nearly four years ago, the first Starbucks location in Buffalo, N.Y., won a union election in December of 2021. Since then, over 11,000 workers at around 550 stores have unionized, while the company has racked up over 400 violations, with more than a thousand ULP charges filed by the union. There is not a single contract at any of the unionized shops.

Two locations in Minnesota are on strike: one in St. Anthony and one in Chanhassen. On November 13, or Red Cup Day, the union hosted a rally at the St. Anthony location, where members of the community and other unions gathered in support of the baristas.

Abby Haland works at the St. Anthony store and is a member of Starbucks Workers United. She says workers are fed up with deteriorating working conditions and the extreme wealth disparity between workers and leadership. According to a report by the AFL-CIO, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol made 6,666 times more money than the average Starbucks worker in 2024.

“We are fed up with a company that treats workers as expendable while they pretend to value us,” Haland said at the rally. “But here is the truth: Real power doesn’t lie in cutting workers’ hours. Real power doesn’t come from writing workers up. Real power doesn’t look like a paycheck 6,666 times bigger than hours.” 

“Real power comes from something Brian Niccol forgot,” Haland continued. “There are more of us than there are of him. The rich and powerful want us to forget that they are few, and we are many. But our union is proof. Together we have the power to change everything.”

Bryn Osborne has worked in a Starbucks location inside of Jerry’s Foods in Edina, Minn. since 2021. Workers at this location are represented by UFCW Local 663 and are not on strike since they are employed by Jerry’s Foods, not Starbucks. But she attended the rally to support striking baristas.

“We do the same job, and I’ve done it with a contract and without a contract. It’s a night and day difference,” she said at the rally. “The wages are much better. I have guaranteed raises every six months, I’m eligible for healthcare, benefits, bereavement pay, everything that a union contract offers.”

Jennifer Greenfield works at Cub Foods and is a member of UFCW Local 663, and she also came to the rally in support of workers. “I’ve been around a long time, and I see how benefits keep getting eroded,” she said.

Former baggage handler at Delta Air Lines, Kip Hedges, says this national strike by Starbucks workers is significant for the labor movement. “It represents a whole generation of young workers that are coming in with a lot of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas that can help transform the labor movement,” said Hedges. “We have a few new breezes blowing, and a win here could increase the speed of the wind.”

Niccol made $96 million in 4 months, and the company also invested $81 million for a conference for managers. The union says a multi-year contract would cost less than $80 million to finalize.

Workers are asking the public to sign a pledge backing their demands and refusing to cross the picket line while workers are on strike. On November 20, the union announced a new wave of striking stores, and it will continue expanding the rolling strike to more stores if no progress is made.

“The fact that people are willing to rally shows that it’s important and it matters. It’s not just a small thing. It’s a big deal,” said Davitch. “It restores my faith in humanity.”

1p81c0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p81c0x/emotional_betrayal/,Emotional betrayal,"TL;DR: found messages on a partners phone, unethical relationship and intimate bond with another. Unsure what to do. 

I’m unsure where to begin. I’m 30(f), my partner is 38(m). We have been together for a year, and I can only define this time as a pure, supportive partnership where we have supported each other through hardship but connected and enjoyed life together.  We were starting to talk about coming together more formally and plans for the future. We both knew we wanted children before we started dating - I made that very clear as I have had relationships in the past where that choice has destroyed them.

Our relationship is incredible. We match on an intimacy level, we communicate well and have intellectual conversation, we laugh, we have fun, we enjoy the same things but also are both diverse in our interests.

This weekend he left his laptop open, and I saw his WhatsApp messages to a girl I had raised problems with before - notably the nature of their relationship. There is a power dynamic that cannot be ignored and I told him he was playing with fire by continuing to nurture this, particularly because this woman seems really mentally unwell and he would continuously (only in the early days) mention how she would send him a barrage of abuse and tell him how awful he was and then backtrack and he would be the best person in the world. He mentioned her a few times when we were in the early stages of dating, and I made it clear that I thought this was an unhealthy dynamic and he had to reassess his position in this and stop feeding this behaviour due to the ethics of it. I had no idea they were in contact to the degree that they are. I should also mention that he has multiple female friends, and I have no qualms about this. They are supportive friendships, and I am not jealous. I have given him so much of myself, but mostly I have trusted that there is nothing to worry about.

I skimmed the messages. But I saw a lot in there - notably one night late he told her he was horny. And questioning her during a conversation about whether she was thinking about a literary trope in a sexual way. Turns out they’ve been sharing “coffee”, too, via video chat. So nights he has been separate from me, he has been video calling with a girl across the world. He also mentioned something about me in that I didn’t want to pursue his dream to run a railway station in a rural county - something that I perceived as a throwaway comment. He’s made a few mentions about me, and my living situation. He also mentioned about his intention to move abroad, due to applying for work elsewhere, and she asked him what would happen to me. He responded with “she may come too” or something along those lines. When in actuality, he has asked me to come with him and told me he will financially provide for me.

I feel at a loss. I love this person and our relationship to date - though we have had our own little fragmented moments, as most do, but I have to stress that they have been futile - has been overall overwhelmingly pure and positive and full of love and care. I feel so blindsided.

I confronted him, of course, and he’s mortified. But he doesn’t recognise the level of disrespect. He has broken something within us.

I wanted this man to be the father of my children, to share a life together. I don’t know what to do.",1,1764247524.0,relationships,3,1.0,False
1p81bdm,https://www.reddit.com/r/byler/comments/1p81bdm/guys_i_think_noah_spoiled_byler/,"Guys, I think noah spoiled byler","Noah once said in a interview that will would find someone to love and have a coffee with in s5. But also duffers obviously don't want many new charectors this season too. And no new charector was even shown in trailers, teasers and all the promo material we have watched. So did noah just spoil this for me or what lmao. If they were tryna make a move on arc I'm afraid it's gonna be rushed since he just in one episode he started ""moving on"", he will need atleast alot more episodes. The painting lie hasn't been mentioned yet, this season really doesn't focus on charectors emotions and feelings it focuses on defeating vecna (unlike the California plot in s4, where there wasn't much defeating vecna lowkey) So huhh? If wills new ""love interest"" exists then when would Will confess to mike? What time do they have to add new charectors

it's apparent for byler they're taking the route of extreme slowburn and figure it out yourself what is cannon and what not. So it doesn't really take away time for the plot and they can do so while devolping the plot. 


If they go for the new love intrest route, they still have alot to do especially with building up a new charector and a whole new relationship dynamic and be fr if we consider the ep4 as Will ""moving on"" arc its possibly not enough time in one episode to move on it will probably be like ep 4, 5 and 6 they could be taking the will moving on arc which is possible but new love intrest arc will have to happen in either ep 7 and 8, in the most plot climatic and ending of the show moments if you think we don't have time for new charector plus romance in the first episodes they for sure won't have it in the last episodes. They could maybe do it in 6 and 7, technically yes but would still be very rushed especially for Wills feelings, I don't expect him to fall in love as soon as he moves on from mike too. 

This seems like all of s5 is happening in a week or two weeks timespan. as well, in the 4 episodes we watched there's not much of a time jump like even of a few days even.. I think Noah saying that just made me very sure that byler is happening because why lie if not byler, we don't have time for a new charector, Will moving on arc and building a romance all at the same time. It would make sense if it was only a moving on arc, then there's a possibility that byler isn't cannon. If it was a moving on arc why would Noah lie about this? I think for me this clears alot of my byler doubt lmao

**The Evolution of Drafting Tools: From Boards to Algorithms**

I still remember the first time I walked into a real drafting room. It smelled like pencil shavings, ammonia from blueprint machines, and whatever lunch someone microwaved too long. Every desk had a massive drafting board with an angle arm that always squeaked at the worst moment. If you bumped the table, you basically had to redo the entire drawing. People who learned on paper still joke that the T square was the original coworker that never listened.

Fast forward a couple of decades and the tools we use now feel like a completely different world. Instead of a wall of filing cabinets full of drawings, we have servers that can store every revision of everything we ever touched. Instead of erasing a section until the paper wore thin, you just hit Undo. And instead of needing three sets of hands to hold a template, scale, and coffee, we now click a few icons and the view updates in seconds.

What has been interesting to watch is how the mindset of drafting has changed along with the tools. Back on the boards, you had to think through a drawing before you touched pencil to paper. Every line took effort. Mistakes cost time. So the planning phase was almost sacred. People sat quietly, mentally laying out each view before committing anything to vellum.

When early CAD arrived, most of us treated it like a digital version of the board. We still thought in the old way. Then the software grew smarter. Constraints, parametrics, feature trees. Suddenly you could try three ideas before lunch and not fear ruining half a day of work. The pace changed and so did the expectations. Designers who were raised on CAD often explore more freely because the cost of exploration is low.

The next phase is happening right now and it is both exciting and a little uncomfortable. We are watching drafting shift from a manual interpretation of a model to something that happens automatically. I have seen teams where algorithms generate entire drawing sets in minutes. The role of the engineer moves toward checking and improving instead of producing every detail by hand. Some people love this and some feel like something is being lost. I get both sides.

What I tell younger engineers is that each generation of tools forces us to redefine where our value really comes from. The board era rewarded precision and patience. The first wave of CAD rewarded digital fluency and the ability to iterate fast. The current era rewards people who can guide automation, set standards, and understand where the computer might get things wrong.

No matter how the tools evolve, someone still needs to think. Someone still needs to ask why a part looks the way it does. Someone still needs to decide what matters for manufacturing, safety, or function. Tools help, but they do not replace judgment and experience.

I am curious how others feel about this shift. If you started in the board era, do you miss it at all? And if you started in the fully digital world, do you feel like the jump to automated drafting is exciting, concerning, or just another step in the journey?",1,1764247188.0,CADAI,0,1.0,False
1p817ag,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1p817ag/for_small_business_owners_who_tried_brand_story/,For small business owners who tried brand story videos how much of your story do you actually want in there？,"I have been helping a few small brands turn their origin story into short videos and I wanted to hear from people who actually run businesses how this lands on your side.

It started with one friend who runs a small skincare brand and really disliked writing long about pages. She sent me a deck, old posts, notes about why she started, and a folder of photos. Later a local coffee shop and a small SaaS tool did something similar. The source material always looks the same: many scattered pieces, no clear story.

What I do now is take all of that and rewrite it into one short script that sounds like a person talking, not a pitch deck. Two to three minutes, maybe four at most. Why you started, who you serve, what changes for the customer, one clear next step. When the script feels clean, I run it through MovieFlow to get a rough brand story video where the scenes and pacing follow the text. Then I bring that draft into a normal editor such as Resolve Free or CapCut and swap in real photos, product shots, screenshots, logo and music, so the structure comes from the script and the real footage keeps it human.

In the end they usually put it on the homepage or the about page, and sometimes send it to new partners or new hires instead of retelling the story each time. Cut down versions can work in ads or email, but I am still trying to understand how useful this really is compared to a well written block of text.

So I wanted to ask from a small business owner point of view if you had a brand story video like this

I have a bit of a strange question, and it's one that I've wondered for years. Ever since I was 19 I think (I'm 31 now), I've been drinking some form of caffeine daily. On average, I would say that I drink 2 cups of tea (English Breakfast) and sometimes one cup of coffee, but not always. Sometimes it'll be 3 cups of tea instead. I would say that I therefore average about 120-170mg a day of caffeine. So not a huge amount.

I have also noticed that since I was 19, I've been basically anhedonic and depressed (on and off). I'm not saying that caffeine is the cause, because I think that's owing to another trigger in my life, but I'm wondering if it could be making things worse. I have ADHD also. I've tried many things for my mood and depression and very little works. 

Do you think it's worth a go to come off completely, or is my intake not really that much to make a difference? I do really like the taste of tea and the slight buzz it gives; coffee is often too much for me atm, but I still have it if I feel very tired.

Nothing fancy just good coffee and a grill that squeaks louder than my own bones in the morning. Some days, the place feels more like a second living room than a business.

Last week, a kid came in, pockets empty, eyes tired, and asked if he could just get water.  
You could see the hunger on him—the kind of look that says he hadn’t eaten properly in days.

So I brought him a plate, piled high, and told him,  
“Don’t worry about it today.”

The next morning, he came back not for food, but to drop off *$5 and a note*:

“Thank you for treating me like a human being.”

That note floored me. It changed everything.

The table behind him paid for the next customer.  
A delivery driver threw in $10.  
Someone taped a sticky note to a jar that said:  
“Feed the next person who needs it.”

Now people quietly pay it forward every single day.  
No signs, no promotions, no expectations. Just people quietly taking care of each other, all because of one small act of kindness.

I didn’t create a program.  
I just gave one meal.

But somehow… the whole community decided to keep it going.

The whole thing is backward:

Work more and harder = your time becomes less valuable.

Work exactly your contracted hours = you're told you're not ambitious.

So I sat down and calculated what my hourly rate comes out to based on the time I really work. I found that if I worked at the coffee shop downstairs, I'd make more per hour, and at least there, they'd have to give me a break. This whole 'salary' thing means nothing other than them draining you to the last drop without paying a single cent of overtime.

On top of all that, they treat me like I should be kissing their hands, front and back, for having this 'professional' job. But I'm burning out, my personal life is disappearing, and I see the real value of my money decrease the more they expect me to be 'committed'.

That random inconvenience forced me to actually be awake dressed and outside a bit earlier than usual. And the entire workday  felt strangely smooth. I finished tasks faster had actual energy and for the  first time in months I did not have that weird brain fog that usually hits around 11. After that I decided to try something simple .

Demand for [flats in Kochi](https://www.assethomes.in/flats-in-kochi/) and flats in Ernakulam in recent years has made the district one of the biggest property hubs, with investors and end-users both flocking to the area. But what is fueling the boom?

First and foremost, Ernakulam's great connectivity is a prime reason. The presence of the Kochi Metro, good roads, the international airport, and a crowded rail system have made commuting a piece of cake. Whether you stay in [luxury apartments in Kochi](https://www.assethomes.in/flats-in-kochi/) or low-cost housing on the periphery, you never face any issue of accessibility.

Secondly, the city's economic development has increased demand for property. Kochi boasts InfoPark, SmartCity, and a port, all of which create millions of employment opportunities. As business centers and IT parks grow, increasing numbers of working professionals prefer to reside in the vicinity, triggering more demand for quality flats in Ernakulam.

Cultural diversity is yet another feather on Ernakulam's cap. The locals enjoy a pleasant blend of tradition and modernity - from Kathakali performances to sophisticated malls like Lulu Mall and city coffee shops. This metropolitan life is attractive to families and young professionals who would like to strike a balance between work and play.

One of the reasons why Ernakulam is sparkling on the realty map is the trust developed by builders in Kerala. Top builders are offering well-designed, green, and amenity-rich apartments in Ernakulam that are affordable to all pockets, making the home-buying process easier and more credible than ever before. They offer transparent documents, modern amenities, and after-sales services which increase customer confidence. Finally, with developmental projects such as the Water Metro and continuous road widening, the future is even brighter. Property prices will appreciate consistently, making Ernakulam a smart investment for end-users and investors alike.

In short, good connectivity, economic dynamism, cultural diversity, good builders, and forward-looking infrastructure are propelling Ernakulam to the top of Kerala's real estate market. Whether you are looking for flats in Kochi or [apartments in Trivandrum](https://www.assethomes.in/flats-in-trivandrum/), now is the time to act. The way forward is obvious — Ernakulam is not just growing, it is thriving as Kerala's favorite real estate destination.",1,1764246034.0,u_NileshKasurde,0,1.0,False

1p80uo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p80uo2/gift_for_boyfriend_150/,Gift for boyfriend [£150],"Hi everyone, I’m looking for a bit of advice from someone that has never owned an espresso or coffee machine before.

I purchase a breville barista max usedfrom eBay for £131 for my bf for Christmas(I used £67 from my top cash back) so machine stands me at £64, it’s in good working order just a few minor scratches. 

I have seen the Philips fully automatic coffee machine 2200 Series, black (EP2220/10) on eBay brand new from Philips for £150

Would you stick with the breville or sell them purchase the Philips?

Thank you😁

1p80ruy,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingthruit/comments/1p80ruy/blocked_still/,Blocked Still?,"## Writer's Block? More Like Writer's *Bleh*. Let's Fix This:

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush. Now go forth and conquer that blank page! (And maybe wear a lampshade for good luck.)",1,1764245730.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False
