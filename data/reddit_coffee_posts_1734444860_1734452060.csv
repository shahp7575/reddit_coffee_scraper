I ran into a weird room, does anyone remember that cliche room adjustment where theres a door way into a horizontal hallway that leads into another door way? imagine that but the hallway is not straight, and dark. i hid there potentially behind something maybe a coffee table or something? I remember seeing a creature with its back turned to me, but than I blinked and it was gone, but something else was about to search the room. I remember looking down when I sensed it, just that, sensed, there wasn't enough light for me to see the thing's reflection on the floor, I just sensed it, I think that I also knew what it was, some four legged beast, I remembered it, and I hated it. not a competition hate or the hate you give to someone whose trying to hurt or kill you. but this hate that this thing is after me, as if I can't defend myself, only out wit it maybe? I think I'm adding to the dream. I look up and it's staring right at me, it feels familiar as if I have encountered this thing in other dreams. and I think the creature jolted at me before I woke up.  

I'm going to see if i can reflect this dream get any meaning out of it, and pray. I need to figure out what this creature is, why its so familiar, and why I forgot about it.",1,1734451737.0,Dreams,0,1.0,False

I enloyed a piece of 12 dollar orange flavoured layer cake, along with a cop of 10 dollar filter coffee, both financed with a loan. Later I had a 14 dollar dry martini with fragrant lemon zest, generic draft beer and a hotdog.
I then ran up and down a hill several times and performed various exercises in an effort to develop endurance and encourage muscle growth, mainly due to existential dread and vanity. 
Eating the cake gave me a profound sense of fulfillment as I experienced pleasure that slowly turned to disgust. In this I am the Nietzschean last man, the books I have read that enables me to frame my behavior in such a way was also financed with loans, loans I am eligible for by being a student at a traditionally Marxist university, where I study an arbitrary mixture of subjects, such as math and design theory. I have no ambition beyond pleasuring myself, I create no value for anyone, in fact, I decrease my own value by taking loans. My knees hurt but I run regardless, for masochistic reasons. I repeat a narrow subset of activities, like someone only trying the same two rides in a theme park, knowing the others are quite the same. These activities serve no purpose, they are the purpose, I study because it is free, I get paid to do it, and I get to avoid work, I have no idea what I am studying towards, except more studying. I will never be able to afford a mortgage, subprime or otherwise, I will never have children and I will never retire. I am obsessed with health as I think I will be self-financing my existence until death, how I will stay sane and physically fit is my primary concern, I am playing a game of battle royale with my fellow last men, we all resent each other, and we all stand around passively, waiting for each other to collapse, fixing to consume whatever remains. But I enjoy myself, out of all the rocks I could have pushed up hills, mine is light, perfectly spherical and the hill is only slightly inclined. I will not go down in history, I will not go down in anything nor will I go down on anyone, except Ronald McDonald. I am out of circulation yet still circulating, like a worker ant in a neglected ant farm in an adolescent’s room. The only sin is to not enjoy oneself. ",1,1734451632.0,Schizotypal,0,1.0,False
1hgdxod,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1hgdxod/how_to_make_my_family_understand_that_my/,"How to make my family understand that my grandfather has dementia and isn't just ""an old man""","I'll try and make this story short, sorry in advance.

My aunt (50F) lives and takes care of my grandpa (85?M) who has been diagnosed with dementia after suffering from 4 strokes over the past 15 or so years. He is wheelchair bound pretty much all the time and has right side stiffness due to him refusing to walk because ""only a car ride can help me walk."" He can walk but he basically drags himself with his walker.

The main issue is that my aunt, who also has to work but recently lost her remote job, is suffering from lack of sleep, lack of peace, can't go out and due much since there is no one home to watch him. They both refuse to get an at home nurse provided by the government because they don't want anyone in their house, especially if my aunt isn't home she's scared they're going to steal something, and/or install cameras while she's not home to spy on them. They fired the government provided physical therapist bc they didn't think my grandpa was getting better (the PT came only about 6x, 2x a week). 

There was an at home nurse but at the time my grandmother was still alive and her and my aunt would greet the home nurse, make her sit and drink coffee and have a meal with them instead of letting her do her job. This happened maybe 3x before the nurse just stopped coming and in return my aunt thinks ""what can a nurse do that I can't? It's a waste to have her here since I'll have to take care and feed two people now instead of one."" Obviously we tell her to just let the nurse do her job but she thinks it's rude to not feed a ""guest"" and won't budge on that. 

They also both refuse to allow an Uber or Lyft to pick them up to take them to a doctors appointment bc they don't want anyone knowing their business and believe it should be the family who takes them to and from doctors, which has resulted in many, many doctor appointment cancellations and just not having certain doctors in general. My aunt doesn't drive or have a car. 

If my grandpa wants some type of gourmet meal, she stops what she's doing and makes it, even if it takes hours for her to cook and now she's completely behind on the day. She does this bc she doesn't want to make him upset and raise his blood pressure so literally anything he wants, she'll stop what she's doing and give/ help him do whatever it is. She'll tell him negavtive things that are happening on the neighborhood and on the news instead of of trying to keep things happy for him and with this he only gets more paranoid.

His doctor (he only had a cardiologist because all the other doctors that they've seen ""aren't nice"") has told her to consistently take his blood pressure twice a day, morning and night, and to keep track to see if they can reduce the medicine he's on. He also told her to stop letting my grandfather have caffeine as that is raising his blood pressure and not letting him sleep and making him more agitated. She doesn't take his blood pressure, maybe once a month, and gives him shots of straight espresso whenever he wants (multiple times a day) bc ""he's old and deserves some happiness."" She also gives him HEAVILY fried foods and rich and fatty foods ""occasionally"" (once a day) bc again ""he's old and he should be happy."" He doesn't have teeth and she doesn't try and make fried foods softer and doesn't understand that this is a choking hazard no matter how many times we've told her. 

It's gotten to the point where he is now having nightmares and doesn't sleep much, causing my aunt not to sleep much. They sleep in the living room, him on a bed and her on a couch. 

Every few weeks she has to call the ambulance at random times of the day and night bc he'll say he can't breathe, that he feels super uncomfortable bc he's bloated and constipated, or that he just wants her to call and he'll keep at it until she completely loses it and gives in. The 911 operator has told her she needs to stop bc she's abusing the system and that if it's not an actual emergency they'll end up fineing her. 

She'll call us crying, saying she hasn't slept in days and that he keeps her up bc he constantly wants stuff throughout the night and day and she can't sit and just relax for 10 minutes. The house is also a mess due to a hording situation and she doesn't have time to go thru everything and clean. 

Me and my family live about three hours away and travel every other week or so to stay for the day and help her watch my grandfather while she can go out and get some stuff done, but with both of them (mainly my aunt bc my grandfather isn't in his right mind) not allowing someone to come and help out at the house, giving him expresso which makes him stay up, and not giving him foods good for the gut to reduce bloating, what can be done? She only wants family to help but the area they live in is also dangerous and we have to keep a constant eye on our car to make sure no one is trying to damage or steal it. The drive there is also dangerous bc we have to take several bridges and people love to speed and cut people off on them. I absolutely hate the ride there. 

When we are there, we tell my grandpa that he simply can't eat whatever fatty food he wants, and that he has to eat what we made for him or he can starve. He'll sit and pout for a bit but will eventually eat whatever it is we make for him. If he demands that we get something for him, we tell him to wait and we'll get it when we have the time. He'll mutter stuff to himself but eventually just sits and waits patiently. We've told my aunt to treat him like a child, either way what you're being served or your going to go to bed hungry. She'll nob in understanding and literally 10 minutes later make him another gourmet meal bc he wants it instead of making him a quick sandwich or salad. Everything goes in one ear out the other. 

I've called the local hospital to see if they have doctors that do home visits and they don't. They refuse to see a neurologist bc apparently none in the area that speak their native language are nice, and a general practitioner ""isn't needed."" 

One trip when he was actually taken to the ER, the doctor who did the exam on him said he has dementia but again my aunt refuses to take him bc every time there is a doctor's appointment scheduled, my aunt will get my grandfather ready to leave and he'll protest, saying he feels fine and she'll cancel the appointment. When me and my family get mad at her for doing that she genuinely doesn't understand why that's an issue and that if he says he feels fine then he's fine since he knows him best. We'll tell her he has dementia and that he doesn't really know what's going on and she'll full on freak out, yelling at us to stop saying that word. It's been like this for about 4 years so it isn't just ""she doesn't wanna believe it"" it's the fact that she very genuinely refuses to believe it, even if a doctor told her to her face that that is the case. 

Everyone is at their wits end and we feel for my aunt but the solution is pretty simple, technically speaking, but she just refuses to do it. Does anyone have any advice? This it what first person in our family to suffer from dementia.

*New Casablanca orbit: Homeplate, Office of the Colonel*

Colonel Sinclair's office was still well lit, though it was well past the normal time for lights-out on the asteroid. The Colonel was running through budgets and job offers and weighing a multitude of pros and cons of assignment and then began debating whether he should have another coffee or actually go home and hit the rack. The communicator made that decision for him, as it came in with a message from Skunkworks Insurance. He groaned softly. These assholes never had good news at this hour. He tapped the accept button.

""Mister Ryan, Agent Smith from Skunkworks Insurance. I hope you've had an opportunity to look over the extended warranty we sent over?""

""Yeah, I'm not sure I like this policy. Too many unknowns, and if my boys are reading this right, pretty much every possible incident that can happen in space falls under a force majeure clause and doesn't get covered. So what's in this for us?"" Skunkworks had sent over a few job offers, and that was the accepted way of telling them to find some other sucker for their greasework.

""Then let's get to work on a new policy for your new guy Balto. I've got some very interesting multi-species policies sitting on my desk right now looking for a new home. We wouldn't be doing our job if we didn't have something tremendous on offer for you – but we'd need some buy in from you.""

Colonel Sinclair twitched a bit. Usually that meant someone was about to step into something warm and fragrant, and the multi-species mention meant the Foreign Legion, and with Gryzzk being name-dropped like that meant there was something very dangerous afoot.

""Well, I haven't hung up yet.""

""The Commerce Department's hearing some interesting things coming out of Vilantia – someone seems to think that peace ain't all it's cracked up to be, and that's bad for business. A friend of mine was speaking off the record about it, they seem to think this current status is only going to hold for a year or so until the wind changes direction and starts blowing toward Hurdop, and then toward our head office.""

This was why Colonel Sinclair hated spook work. The double and triple meanings were icing on a cake that he didn't much care for.

""So where's the 7th come in?""

""Well, you were the first to what appears to be a new untapped market. And we can understand you're in business to make money just like us, so you might be a little wary. But the Commerce Department's interested and would certainly pay out a decent finders' fee for any specific information that allows the Commerce Department to make sure everyone wakes up happy. Cause if them folks out there don't wake up, R&D's got some damn fine alarm clocks on the drawing board.""

""Define 'decent finders fee' for me. I like numbers. You could say I'm a fan of numbers. Specifically the ones in the 7th Cav's bank account.""

""Well, your calculator'll make a happy face at least.""

""Alright, I'll let 'em know.""

*Terran Foreign Legion Ship* Twilight Rose

Gryzzk awoke slowly, and looked around. Nhoot was still asleep, and That meant he had a few precious moments of quiet before the insanity began. Part of him was curious as to how Rosie and Tucker would react to each other – the other part of him was concerned that he'd just given a young child a bushel of fireworks and permission to do as she willed. Still, he showered and grabbed a fresh uniform just in time for Nhoot to wobble into the shower for her morning routine. She hummed happily and got into her own uniform, and finally they nodded at each other to approve and Nhoot dashed out to the mess hall for breakfast.

Gryzzk was about to make his exit himself however his way was somewhat blocked by Rosie as she came in. She exaggerated her posture a bit to make up for her lack of scent, but she seemed anxious as she spoke rapidly.

""My Lord, I was hoping you had an opinion. I have run seventeen thousand simulations extrapolating from known data, but I cannot find a proper uniform design in order to optimize success. The opinions of the bridge squad differ highly. Reilly suggested I wear as little as possible, but she did not elaborate further. O'Brien shrugged. Hoban suggested something with grease on it, and Edwards recommended I wear the standard duty uniform.""

Gryzzk blinked a few times. ""Rosie, is it quite possible that you're overthinking this?""

She shook her head. ""Not at all. I have been running the simulations over the past nine hours and have spent just under two minutes on each simulation."" She smiled brightly. ""It was not computationally exhaustive.""

""I can only assist so much, but draw on your Terran knowledge as much as possible, as the guidance of Vilantia may not be the best. You are after all attempting to sway the feelings of a Terran.""

Rosie considered before changing her uniform a bit. Her shirt tightened with a knot forming in the back, and her shorts became similarly snug. ""I believe this will accentuate the feminine features that Terrans find most appealing, and it was able to contribute to success in three thousand of the simulations. I will retrieve Chief Tucker."" With that she left, leaving Gryzzk to wonder just how success was being defined.

Gryzzk exhaled, exiting the bridge to some sort of horn-like music that had O'Brien moving her head in time with it and the rest of the bridge staring at her in some manner of disdain. For Gryzzk's part it seemed to have the same manner of energy that called one to battle. It was curious.

The walk to the Mess Hall was fairly quick, with only Nhoot being chased by Jonesy as the only real interruption from a smooth ship morning.

And then the XO arrived with the Chief in tow. The Chief Engineer was mostly cleaned up, although it did not look like he'd slept much. He appeared to be upright only by the grace of the large mug of coffee in his hand.

Gryzzk cocked his head slightly. ""Chief Tucker, do we need to look into expanding the Engineering team? You seem to be overexerting yourself.""

He received a headshake in response. ""Negative Cap. Just gotta get 'em spun up. They keep falling into the same traps, though. 'This is the way we've always done it' is like their default response to anything, no matter how many times I keep telling them. They're never conservative on paper, it's like they've never even heard of Scotty Time, and they just...they can see how it's better, but they can't unfuck their headspace.""

""Explain 'Scotty Time' over breakfast."" Gryzzk walked through to the mess proper, selecting what was advertised as the Terran fruit ""cantaloupe"" with his Vilantian porridge and then a large mug of Earl Grey tea before walking properly to his table.

Behind him Rosie was quietly trying to convince Tucker that something healthy would not be a bad thing as he topped several waffles off with sausage patties and then finally grabbed a few strawberries for the side, and then topped off his coffee before lumbering over to sit heavily across from Gryzzk.

""Chief, you were explaining Scotty time."" Rosie prompted Tucker as she glided through the table and sat down. She had generated a healthy (albeit holographic) Vilantian breakfast for herself to nibble at so that it didn't look awkward, as well as some holographic strawberries for herself.

Tucker looked left, looked right and grumbled into his coffee. ""Ancient Terran secret passed down from Engineer to Engineer. Someone asks you for a timeframe, you figure out the time and then add fifteen percent.""

Gryzzk was confused. ""...why would you do something like that?""

""Something always goes wrong. Wrong parts get printed, tool breaks, someone forgot to mention they crosswired fire control with the climate control and nobody noticed until someone adjusts their ambient humidity and we've got a firing solution on the nearest patch of ice. So that extra time gets eaten up, and if by some miracle everything goes right you're a genius. And ten cred says the next words out of your mouth are going to be 'we don't do that on Vilantia' or something.""

""Well, we don't. It defies the Clan Way."" Gryzzk glanced at Rosie, who was licking her holoberry for some reason.

""Forgive my saying Cap, but your Clan Way seems to be a one-sided kinda deal."" Tucker began eating heartily, glancing at Rosie every now and then curiously.

Gryzzk looked down while eating. ""To an outsider, yes. But it was what kept Vilantia from falling into utter chaos.""

""I've heard the stories, no need to defend it. But we're in interesting times. And if I were you, I'd start thinking on a new Clan Way.""

""Me?"" Gryzzk was taken aback by the suggestion.

""Mm-hm. You got the head for it. Every Vilantian on this ship learned the same lesson, and every Hurdop had a front row seat to their version of the Clan Way failing. Pick whatever the best parts are from both. You're both good peoples, but you got thirty-some generations of cruft built up. I think you deserve better."" Tucker finished his breakfast and drained his cup. ""Oh, and Cap?""

""Yes Chief?""

""Two things – One, thanks for breakfast, we'll do it again. And two, don't be shocked if a Vilantian and a Hurdop ask you to marry 'em.""

""But I can't?""

Tucker smirked. ""You might want to read up on that."" He stood, nodding to both as he left. ""Cap. Rosie.""

As soon as he left, Gryzzk looked down to see that he'd only eaten about two-thirds of his breakfast. Terrans ate rapidly, it seemed. Another oddity – breakfast was to be enjoyed, not inhaled. Yesterday notwithstanding.

Rosie sighed softly. ""I'd be so good to him. I'd run through a gauss field just to hear him tell me it was a bad idea and I should never do it again while he carried my emitter to the repair bench. I'd bounce off four walls for a chance at making some holographic fur on his chest to braid.""

""That is certainly...an image, Rosie.""

She didn't seem to fully register that he was talking to her as she continued. ""I'd build a body just to drag it over hot sand if he rubbed my forehead at the end of it.""

Gryzzk sipped at his tea. It seemed like whatever Terran romance protocols were installed in her, they were taking up the majority of her current runtime. Finally she looked at him.

""Did you notice? He was looking at me while we were eating."" She had a look of bliss on her face.

""Does that mean this was successful?""

""I believe so.""

""Very well. I believe I'll take my tea to the bridge, and we can discuss things further."" Gryzzk slid his tray into the recycling and quietly murmured his gratitude to the troops his passed along the way to the bridge.

Once at the bridge, Rosie quietly announced his presence to the squad, and Reilly turned the music down to allow conversation. The rest of the bridge staff removed their headphones as Reilly rushed over.

""So?!"" It was quite possible that Reilly was more interested in breakfast than anyone else.

Gryzzk settled into his chair. ""Status, First Sergeant?""

""Still not my circus, still not my clowns.""

""Not precisely what I asked.""

""Tactical's nominal, Cap'n. Still want to beat the crap out of whoever turned Reilly onto that mess she calls music.""

""Acceptable but beat them up on your own time.""

""*Fiiiine*.""

""Is that tonal inflection learned?""

O'Brien didn't even blink. ""Yep. Passed down from generations since Adam and Eve told Cain and Abel to clean their rooms.""

""I have questions for later. Helm, status?""

Hoban smirked a bit as he responded. ""Currently amused that Rosie's first chaperoned date went well – still on course for Hurdop Prime, ETA 26 hours.""

""Sensors?""

""R-space is still pretty."" Edwards leaned back in her seat.

""Good. I have a bit of project for you. I require Terran historical knowledge.""

""There's a lot of that.""

""Keep it within times of revolution and great social change.""

""Respectfully Captain do you have any idea how little that narrows it down?"" Edwards quirked an eyebrow.

""Let's keep it to the historically significant ones?""

Edwards swiveled her chair to face Gryzzk. ""Okay so off the top of my head, the main causes for revolution are economic – all the poor people eventually got together and decided that being dead was better than being poor, and the system of governance changed.""

""Howso?""

""Well in ancient times, the rulers claimed a mandate from the divine. After these systems fell apart, the most popular form was a shift to a system where the leader was elected from among the citizenry.""

That made absolutely no sense to Gryzzk. ""But if they were wise enough to rule, they would have ruled from the beginning.""

Edwards shook her head. ""Not really. Not everyone was born with the same circumstance, so they had to work to leadership. Look at you. You didn't just walk into this gig, you earned it.""

""But to apply that on a planetary scale?""

""Cap, what's the endgame here?""

Even as he spoke the words they sounded foreign to Gryzzk. ""A new system of governance for Vilantia.""

O'Brien whistled lowly. ""Respectfully Cap'n, do you just *not* know how to aim low? Not to mention there's legal implications.""

""Explain.""

""First, doing a revolution is on the list of things Terran merc companies can't do. Charters get revoked, folks get thrown in prison. Second, you're talking about overhauling a planetary system of governance that's been in place for a good long while.""

Edwards spoke up casually. ""That said, the conditions around Vilantia seem optimal for a revolution.""

""Optimal schmoptimal, who's paying the bills? Revolutions ain't cheap, and we ain't on contract for that. We're doing escort and cover for..."" O'Brien paused for a moment while she was thinking it over. ""Sunnovabitch. Edwards, historical parallels to our current sitch - transfer of upper classes to new locations."" O'Brien snapped out the request rapidly.

Edwards had to think for a long minute. ""Common, but it usually happens after a decisive victory in a war. Basically upper class from the winning side sends nobles or whatever upper class there is to enforce their rule, losing side sends or they're forced to send popular folks the other way as hostages to ensure good behavior under the new rule.""

O'Brien groaned as she started putting things together. ""Son. Of. A. *Bitch*. XO, we need your brain here and not imagining being snuggled between Tuckers' flabby-ass thighs for a minute.""

Rosie glided over, her uniform changing to a regulation style. ""Is there something specific you require?""

""Vilantian and Hurdop revolutions, go.""

""None.""

""Are you sure?""

""There are none recorded.""

""Doesn't mean they didn't happen. Would you mind working with Corporal Edwards and see if we can't suss out something on this?""

Gryzzk cleared his throat. ""First Sergeant, I may have additional information. The Lords from Vilantia are in two social groupings; Lord A'ogan leads one grouping of who have the scent of conquest about them. The other group has no clear leader, but they are - less aggressive. It is quite possible that the Minister of Trade wishes to create chaos on Hurdop Prime. From there an actual conquest would be a relatively simple matter, if done effectively. If that is the Ministers' goal."" Gryzzk finished lamely.

""And you were gonna tell the rest of us *when*?""

""When I was more certain. It is possible that there is more going on that we are unaware of.""

O'Brien took a deep breath and exhaled. ""We are going to have to discuss your sense of timing, sir."" Her accent had thickened slightly.

Gryzzk chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment. ""Advise the crew?""

""I'd recommend it, sir.""

Gryzzk nodded, finally tapping on his tablet, opening an all-hands channel. ""Attention company. Please stand by for an announcement from the Captain in five minutes."" He closed the channel. ""What precisely should I tell them, First Sergeant?""

""I'm not in charge around here, Captain.""

Gryzzk sighed softly. ""I suppose I should rephrase that.""

""You should. We'll work on that later.""

The bridge fell to silence, Gryzzk quietly mouthing words and reconsidering before the time ran out. Finally he re-opened the channel.

""Company, this is Captain Gryzzk. Since we arrived at Vilantia Prime, we have been investigating unusual facets regarding our assignment. We believe that our current contract is one piece of a larger plan by elements of the Vilantian Council of Greatlords to create a state of chaos within the Hurdop systems. Currently we do not have knowledge of their goal, but we believe they may be looking to subsume Hurdop.""

Gryzzk took a breath to steady himself and allow the crew to absorb this before continuing. ""We have been made aware of some elements of this, and we have begin taking steps in order to further determine the means, methods, and goals involved. What this means for each of you is that we will need to be in an increased state of vigilance once we are out of R-space. Attend your duties, there will be further briefing tomorrow morning. My goal is a harmonious merging of our two systems. Recent events have shown that we can and should work together in order to benefit both our systems. If you have any questions, please contact the XO. Captain Gryzzk out.""

Gryzzk leaned back heavily in his chair, weighing the implications of what he'd just announced. The bridge was silent for a moment, finally broken by Rosie.

""Captain I have fifteen...twenty-seven...fifty-one communications from various crew members. Twelve of them are inquiries for further information, and the rest are variations on a theme of discontent with the Vilantian Council.""

""Discontent?""

""Yes. Chief Tucker has requested a timetable for us to beat the stupidity out of the Council. I took the liberty of reminding him that it's not legal.""

Gryzzk sank slightly in his chair, contemplating his next option.",1,1734451539.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

Their address will be: [1211 West Main St, Waynesboro, VA 22980](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6MySoQHTXQYNvwbn8).

As you may already know, Kline's has been in the process of building their new ""Espresso Bar"" directly behind their current shop. This would put two coffee shops within a coffee bean's throw from each other.

Kline's Espresso Bar will be drive-thru only and I would assume that the new Micah's would be the same (since all of their other locations are drive-thru only). Although, it would be nice to have another coffee shop in town that you can sit in.

This would bring the total number of actual coffee shops in Waynesboro to 7! (Again, I realize that there are other places where you could get coffee (Crack O' Dawn, Wafflehouse, Weasie's, etc), but I wouldn't consider them straight up ""coffee shops"".)

1hgdt48,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianfitness/comments/1hgdt48/diet_advice_dilemma/,Diet advice dilemma.,"So i managed to lose 28 kilos in a year(went from 115 to 87, still fat for 5'10"") and now my gym trainer tells it to almost every beginner person who isn't that serious or consistent about gym. Now my issue is that they approach me first congratulating then asking me for diet tips and i don't have any answer for it. For 11 months out of the 12, i used to chain smoke everyday. Even right after gym i used to smoke a cigarette. Idk anything about calories, i don't eat any eggs or consume protein daily after workout. I just take creatine and drink black coffee, eat whatever I want/what is made at home(example: yesterday I ate 6 udad and 5 nagli fry papad for dinner) and do full body workout everyday. Gym is like brushing teeth for me i just do it everyday I don't think much about it. I'm thinking about going to the gym at 6 am instead of evening to avoid this situation. Any 2-3 liner tip i should give people that is healthy and will help them? I might have lost weight but I don't think i did it in a proper and healthy way so don't want to give bad advice to people.

1hgdrhz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DogTrainingTips/comments/1hgdrhz/my_rescue_dog_snaps_without_warning_help/,My rescue dog snaps without warning! Help!,"I adopted a 3 year old rescue saluki x lab a month ago. He is from Kuwait originally and was poisoned as a pup. He was then brought here to the rescue. He was adopted for a short period over a year ago where he was likely abused by a man. I was told that he isn’t good with men and needed to be socialized, they also told me he has issues with resource guarding. When I brought him home, I had set up water and food for him and a bed in the living room and one in my bedroom. He was very skittish and just looked for comfort from me. He refused to go in any room and stayed in the living room (which is where the front door is). From the beginning, he has no issues with me. I can take away his food/bones/toys, put my fingers in his mouth, dress him up, he basically lets me treat him like a doll. He is extremely gentle. I did notice he was scared of a lot of things like enclosed spaces, the umbrella, when I would move chairs/coffee table, but never snapped at me.

My brother came to visit with his wife and all went very well, he smelt them and then asked for pets for the 30 minutes they were here. Other friends (females) came over throughout the first week and all went very well, he would smell them then ask for pets. 

In the second week, my brother came over and the beginning of the visit went well. My dog had a pigs ear. My brother was petting the top of his head and all was fine, then he pet his chin and my dog freaked out and bit him without warning. We were both taken aback, I cleaned my brother’s hand and kept my dog away from him for the rest of the visit. 

In the second week, he meets other friends and all goes well, my dog is gentle and sweet and asking for pets and no signs of aggression.

In the third week, my brother comes over again. The beginning of the visit was fine, my dog didn’t have any bone or anything to guard. My brother went to grab his Bible and my dog snapped at his leg, once again without warning, thankfully only getting his jeans. My back was turned making coffee as this happened. My dog then behaves like nothing happened. 
 
Then my girl friend comes over (second time she is meeting my dog) and she had a big backpack on the couch and she went to grab something in it and my dog snapped again but didn’t touch her. He did this twice. I corrected him with a stern voice and stood between the dog and the bag and he sat there shaking in fear (I have never laid a hand on him) as she got what she needed from her bag.

Today, I brought him (for the second time) to my friend’s mom’s (80 yo) house. I got there with a few groceries that she put away, she was then waving grocery bag, as if to fold it, as we were chatting at the kitchen table and my dog snapped again, bruising her leg. 

I see that he is fearful when things are in our hands, but not so much in mine, he has never snapped at me. The issue is not only the snapping but the lack of warning. Does anyone have any advice? I have been trying to desensitize him by walking around with my cane, book bag, being loud, stomping…. and now I am thinking I will have to muzzle train him… ",0,1734451181.0,DogTrainingTips,1,0.5,False
1hgdr9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hgdr9z/tldr_had_great_chemistry_with_a_coworker_who_had/,"**TL;DR:** Had great chemistry with a coworker who had a boyfriend, things got flirty, but she recently broke up with him and now seems distant. Not sure if she’s interested or just needs time—what should I do?","There’s this girl (Mary, F/22) I (M/26) met through work. She initially approached me, commented on my Instagram, and we quickly hit it off. The chemistry was great from the start, but she had a boyfriend, so I kept things friendly and professional.

Over time, I noticed her speaking to me a lot, catching her staring at me, and teasing me in a way that felt more than friendly. At work, she’d sneakily take videos and photos of me, and we’d play games or go for strolls after meetings. She’d even suggest grabbing coffee. It was hard not to develop feelings for her, but I kept my distance because of her relationship.

Things escalated at a gathering where her boyfriend was disrespectful to her (calling her dumb, ignoring her). She gave me intense looks and even sat next to me, which made me nervous since he was there. After that, she started replying to my Instagram stories and texting more, though she’d avoid turning it into long conversations.

We had an inside joke about a cartoon, and when she sent me a picture of a related keychain, I bought it for her as a thoughtful gesture. But when I tried to give it to her, she refused to accept it. After that, our texting stopped.

Recently, she broke up with her boyfriend (about 10 days ago). I haven’t reached out, and she hasn’t either, but we ran into each other at a party. She seemed more reserved with me than she used to be, although I caught her glancing my way a few times. Her ex showed up and acted strangely friendly toward me (he even started liking my Instagram stories), which added to the awkwardness. 

At the party, I brought up the keychain again, but she insisted I keep it, which confused me since it felt like such a meaningful gesture. The confusing part is that she seemed more flirtatious and open with me *before* her breakup than she does now. 

I have a big crush on her, but I don’t know if she feels the same or if I’ve misread the situation. I also don’t want to rush things, considering her recent breakup, but I don’t want to miss my chance either. 

What do you think? Does it sound like I have a chance? What should I do next?

I think some have been driven by medication reactions, others by supplementation or behaviors on my part, by COVID, and so on.  I feel the more i scramble to ""fix"", the more i make missteps that make things worse.  I've spent 6y reading about nothing but nutrition and health and still feel lost at sea.

This would be a monster of a post if i were to go over the history of it all. So I'll spare you.   But suffice to say... my serum IgA is 100-150+ out of range (polyclonal), and my serum calcium has gradually gone up and up until becoming very slightly out of range.    I've  been through the diets ... most of them at this point.

2019 - lost 60lbs on (dirty) keto, but came down with extreme anxiety.  Made 1000x worse with an SSRI.  I still deal with anxiety and insomnia (early wake).

2020 - 2021 - mostly ""plant based"".  Very AIP/Mediterranean focused.  Think Rhonda Patrick.  Lots of VItD supplements, fish oil,  broccoli sprouts, lots of 1-1.5L fruit/veggie smoothies, yogurt, lots of probiotic food, salmon, sardines, chicken.  Beats, sweet potatos, squash soups.  Started jogging frequently.

2022 - 100% stopped seed oils.   more animal based.  added full servings of liver 4-6oz at a time, lots of liver/beef ground mixes, 3-4x a week in re: to the liver, lots of eggs (6 at a time), beef 2-3x a day.  Felt fantastic for a while.   lifting 3x a week and cardio 3x a week.  Sauna 6x a week.  I felt energized, powerful.. happy.  

2023 - end of 2022 to summer of 2023. i moved to a more fruit + beef diet.  Lots of oranges, apples, bananas, papayas,  mangos, etc.  Felt even better. 

But after a horrible reaction to COVID (summer) and giving blood (rashes, panniculitis) all those gains went away.   i played a lot with beef only carnivore and fasting which seemed to resolve the rashes/panniculitis at the result of creating bilateral temple pain and sjogren's symptoms for most of tthe year.  Developed bilateral plantar fasciitis and toe neuropathy too.

2024 - by summer I migrated to a Low A diet and more around Grant's work.   My temple pain mostly resolved.   I get labs tomorrow to see if serum calcium came down.

But as a result i now have skin issues that seem like folliculitis that i can't keep..gone.  My small wounds seem to get easily infected (cuts on fingers, etc..)   And i have tooth pain where it seems the dentin has eroded.   This is all within 3-4months of the diet.  So obviously... this was stupid.   I've come around to tthe main proponents of the diet are just insane.  They make interesting observations but rely too much on really weak evidence, anecdotes of others and are really reductionist about everything.   Retinol avoidance traps ferritin and all the leaders in this space high sky high ferritin and have to do constant blood donations. 

I think there's still something to the whole liver health focus of the ""low toxin"" crowd that  focuses on aldehydes/sulfur/ALDH, but I think everyone is sort of navigating in the dark about fat soluble vitamins and they have A/D completely wrong.    All i know is removing A gave me far more awful symptoms than things it solved. 


Lately camps (anti-seed oil, carnivore, paleo types vs vegetarian/food-pyramid types) seem to be arguing about AA vs LA in tumorgenesis in the colon... and all i can ttink of is Peat warning about all of the ""unsaturated fats"" 

I've been mulling around my raised serum calcium.. and can't help but think.. i ate too much A, i took too much Vitamin D3. too little magnesium, jogging and sauna constantly.  I oscillate between high salt and low (my BP varies wildly.. between 110 SYS to 160 SYS).   And i can't help but think of Peat's focus on PTH, low phosphorous and paradoxically.. higher calcium meals. 

My serum IgA may be cancer (MM or MGUS), may be a low grade infection that's evaded blood culture, it may be autoimmune (i'm HLA B27 positive, gluten gives my psoriasis.  Nightshades does too).    But i come back again and again to the ""carrot salad"" and it's ability to fight endotoxins, the push for easily digestible foods that don't feed bacteria, etc.. 

My ferritin 3y ago was 140.   I can't imagine what it is now... after all the beef, sometimes beef with vitamin C, my period of A depletion, but offset by cardio, sauna, long bouts of apigenin and lactoferrin, and a single blood donation. (and lots of tea, coffee, etc.).    And again... Peat suggesting to keep meat low due to iron oxidation, negative effects of methithione, and PUFA like AA that's even in beef in fair amounts.  

I sit back and see how all the sauna, over-exercising could have chronically dehyrdated me regardless of what i replenish with (largely K and Mg), how it all raises stress hormones, including PTH.    Especially if salt is lost and not replenished.   But maybe i wouldn't have to do high or low salt ... if i just stopped low carb, stopped using the sauna so religiously and let up on the exercise a bit.

I dunno.  I think the whole holistic approach Peat has taken finally connects all the tribes.....it admits their strengths and weaknesses.

And maybe i'm just doing another ""i'm saved!"" thing...  but i'm optimistic this may improve things ..and even if it doesn't., it's balanced enough that i shouldn't hurt myself on it like previous diets.",1,1734450830.0,raypeat,0,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, many people turn to whitening strips. However, a common question is whether you should brush your teeth before or after using these strips. The answer can significantly impact the effectiveness of the whitening treatment and your overall dental health.

First, let’s discuss brushing your teeth before applying whitening strips. Brushing beforehand is generally recommended. Here’s why:

- **Removes Plaque and Food Particles:** Cleaning your teeth ensures that any food debris and plaque are removed, allowing the whitening product to penetrate better and work more effectively.
- **Enhances Whitening Results:** By starting with a clean surface, the whitening strips can bond better to your teeth, enhancing their effectiveness and providing noticeable results.
- **Promotes Oral Health:** Regular brushing usually contributes to healthier gums and teeth. When integrating whitening strips into your routine, maintaining oral hygiene is essential.

However, it’s crucial to wait a little after brushing. Most dental experts suggest waiting at least 30 minutes before applying the whitening strips. This timing is important because:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Pencil out Fluoride:** If you brushed your teeth with fluoride toothpaste, it could potentially inhibit the whitening effect. Waiting allows your teeth to absorb the fluoride properly.
- **Creates a Neutral Environment:** Brushing right before can make your teeth slightly more sensitive to the strips right away. By waiting, you avoid overwhelming your teeth with both the toothpaste and the whitening agents at the same time.

Now, what should you do if you prefer to brush your teeth after using whitening strips? This approach is sometimes debated, but there are points to consider:

- **Immediate Cleaning:** Brushing after can help remove any residual whitening gel, making sure your mouth feels clean and fresh.
- **Sensitivity Management:** If you experience sensitivity, using a gentle toothpaste post-treatment may help soothe your teeth.
- **Maintain Oral Care Routine:** Brushing always remains a fundamental part of oral hygiene, so doing it afterward still promotes good health.

Here’s a recommended routine for using whitening strips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
1. **Brush your teeth:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and a non-abrasive toothpaste.
2. **Wait 30 minutes:** Allow your mouth to neutralize the effects of the toothpaste.
3. **Apply whitening strips:** Follow the instructions included with your whitening product carefully.
4. **Wait recommended time:** Leave the strips on as recommended, usually between 30 minutes to an hour.
5. **Rinse your mouth:** After removing the strips, rinse with water to clear out any residue.
6. **Brush again (if desired):** If you prefer, you can brush again after rinsing to feel extra clean.

Regardless of your preference for brushing before or after whitening strips, the key is to maintain good oral hygiene practices. Remember that keeping your teeth clean will not only help in achieving a brighter smile but also support your overall oral health.

If you notice any increased sensitivity during your whitening treatment, it may be wise to adjust your routine or consult with your dentist. They can provide personalized advice and recommend appropriate products that suit your needs.

In essence, the choice to brush before or after whitening strips is largely personal, but brushing beforehand seems to offer the best results in terms of whitening effectiveness. Always read the specific instructions provided with your whitening product, and don't hesitate to seek professional guidance for optimal results. A radiant smile is always within reach with the right approach!

The Science Behind Teeth Whitening: Understanding the Process and Timing
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening is an attractive option for many looking to enhance their smile, but understanding the science behind this process is crucial for achieving the best results. One common question arises: should you brush your teeth before or after using whitening strips? To address this, we need to delve into how teeth whitening works and the optimal timing for brushing.

Whitening strips contain bleaching agents, often hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide. These ingredients penetrate the enamel and reach the deeper layers of the teeth, breaking down stains and discoloration. The effectiveness of these agents can be influenced by factors such as the condition of your teeth and gums and the timing of your oral hygiene routine.

When considering whether to brush your teeth before or after applying whitening strips, there are a few key points to remember:

- **Brushing Before:** Brushing your teeth prior to using whitening strips can help to remove any surface debris or plaque. This creates a clean surface for the whitening agent to work more effectively. However, it’s essential to wait at least 30 minutes after brushing before applying the strips. This allows your enamel to recover from the abrasion of brushing and can help prevent sensitivity.
- **Brushing After:** Brushing your teeth post-treatment might seem like a good idea to remove any leftover gel. However, doing so immediately can irritate your gums and increase sensitivity as your teeth are already vulnerable after whitening. If you choose to brush afterward, wait at least 30 minutes to an hour to ensure that your enamel is not further compromised.

In addition to the timing of brushing, it’s essential to be mindful of how often you use whitening strips. Overusing these products can lead to enamel erosion and tooth sensitivity. It’s recommended to follow the product instructions carefully, and consult a dentist if you have any concerns, especially if you experience heightened sensitivity.

The overall process of teeth whitening does not end with the application of strips. After treatment, it’s beneficial to avoid certain foods and beverages that can lead to new stains. Some common items to steer clear of include:

- Coffee and tea
- Red wine
- Dark sodas
- Berry fruits
- Sauces, such as soy or tomato

Maintaining regular oral hygiene practices is also vital. Continue flossing daily and brushing twice a day to keep your teeth clean and reduce the risk of developing stains.

While whitening strips are effective, they may not be suitable for everyone. Individuals with sensitive teeth or gum issues might need a gentle approach. Natural methods, such as baking soda and hydrogen peroxide, can sometimes lighten teeth without the harsh effects of commercial whitening products. However, always consult your dentist before attempting any home remedies to ensure they are safe for your dental health.

Another consideration is how long you wear the strips. Most manufacturers suggest a daily application routine, typically for 30 minutes to an hour, over a period of one to two weeks. The results can vary based on the product used and individual dental characteristics. Monitor your progress and adjust as needed so that you can achieve a bright smile without compromising your oral health.

Understanding the science behind teeth whitening can significantly enhance your experience and results. Timing your brushing routine correctly and making conscious choices about your post-whitening care can lead to a healthier and brighter smile. Always prioritize your dental health and seek professional advice whenever necessary.

The effectiveness of whitening strips can be maximized by understanding the correct timing for brushing. Take the time to evaluate your specific needs and consult your dentist to ensure an optimal whitening experience.

### Conclusion

Achieving a brighter smile doesn’t just rely on the quality of whitening strips used; the timing of your brush can significantly influence the effectiveness of this treatment. As we explored, brushing your teeth before applying whitening strips is generally considered best practice. This helps to remove any plaque or debris, allowing the whitening agents to penetrate the enamel more effectively. By ensuring your teeth are clean, you maximize the strips' ability to whiten and brighten your smile.

Understanding the science behind teeth whitening illuminates why timing matters. The ingredients in whitening strips, such as hydrogen peroxide, work best on a clean surface. If your teeth are not properly prepared, you may not get the results you desire. Additionally, brushing after using whitening strips isn’t advisable right away, as it can irritate your teeth and gums. Instead, give the whitening agents some time to work and allow a short period before returning to your regular oral hygiene routine.

Ultimately, mastering the process of using whitening strips means being mindful of how and when you brush. By following the recommended practices, you can ensure that your efforts lead to a stunning, bright smile. Your journey to whiter teeth doesn’t have to be complicated; it's just about knowing the right steps to take for the best outcomes. Embrace this knowledge, and let it guide you towards achieving that radiant smile you’ve always wanted.

So for context I live in Bangalore which is a major metropolitan city and IT hub in India but I am a Bengali Indian guy and many foreigners do come here as expats. So I am studying MBA and already talking with several girls who are Indians too in my grad school but somehow still unable to get a date(I never had a girlfriend before) even though I have some good rapport with some of them. I go to this luxurious mall where the expats of our city goes as its a really upscale part of our city. There I have initiated conversation with 10 expat women so far who were in the 20-35 age range and mainly white Caucasian women.

Most of our conversations happened in the Cafes/coffee shops of the mall and one in the bar area of a restaurant and some were when she was strolling around in the mall. My most recent conversation was with 2 expat women just 3 days ago. One is from US in her 30s and another with a French woman who is definitely in her mid to late 20s in the bar area of a restaurant in the mall. The conversation with the French woman was short as she showed her earphones and eventually said she was listening to something important so can't talk at the moment so we just had a handshake and said nice to meet you. A week ago, I talked with this Ukrainian woman in the Coffee shop within the same mall. And had such conversation with several such women.

The women typically responded in a friendly way and even when I apologized asking whether I made them uncomfortable or not, they said no you are fine. Our conversations are completely normal like asking her whether she works in our city and introducing myself as an MBA student and also just general talks about the city, the food and the country she is from. I don't even ask her out like they do in cold approaching. I am just trying to socialize and even trying to boost my confidence after being super shy near girls for many years but unfortunately the conversations are basically one time and I never get to see them again as I feel hesitant to ask her Instagram or something. I just don't know whether she will feel comfortable enough if I asked her Instagram as we just met. But is my approach still creepy?",1,1734450745.0,AskMenAdvice,7,1.0,False

Not sure if she’s interested or just needs time—what should I do?","There’s this girl (Mary, F/22) I (M/26) met through work. She initially approached me, commented on my Instagram, and we quickly hit it off. The chemistry was great from the start, but she had a boyfriend, so I kept things friendly and professional.

Over time, I noticed her speaking to me a lot, catching her staring at me, and teasing me in a way that felt more than friendly. At work, she’d sneakily take videos and photos of me, and we’d play games or go for strolls after meetings. She’d even suggest grabbing coffee. It was hard not to develop feelings for her, but I kept my distance because of her relationship.

Things escalated at a gathering where her boyfriend was disrespectful to her (calling her dumb, ignoring her). She gave me intense looks and even sat next to me, which made me nervous since he was there. After that, she started replying to my Instagram stories and texting more, though she’d avoid turning it into long conversations.

We had an inside joke about a cartoon, and when she sent me a picture of a related keychain, I bought it for her as a thoughtful gesture. But when I tried to give it to her, she refused to accept it. After that, our texting stopped.

Recently, she broke up with her boyfriend (about 10 days ago). I haven’t reached out, and she hasn’t either, but we ran into each other at a party. She seemed more reserved with me than she used to be, although I caught her glancing my way a few times. Her ex showed up and acted strangely friendly toward me (he even started liking my Instagram stories), which added to the awkwardness. 

At the party, I brought up the keychain again, but she insisted I keep it, which confused me since it felt like such a meaningful gesture. The confusing part is that she seemed more flirtatious and open with me *before* her breakup than she does now. 

I have a big crush on her, but I don’t know if she feels the same or if I’ve misread the situation. I also don’t want to rush things, considering her recent breakup, but I don’t want to miss my chance either. 

What do you think? Does it sound like I have a chance? What should I do next?

I'm considering buying a ""beginner"" machine...
1) I love coffe but am completely new to this speciffic topic
2) I don't want to spend a huge amount of money in the beginning.

I know, the grinder is pretty important so i would go there more pro i guess...
still I would need your opinion on this situation:

I coud buy a 
Lelit Anna PL41 LEM
for little under $300 (showroom model)
or
a pretty old Gaggia Classic for around $50-100

I don't like that the Anna is not the one with the Temp. display. That bothers me. But it's a Lelit and almost brand new.

On the other hand a like to tinker...and would make a Gagguino out of the Gaggia. But i guess i would need to exchange some parts and tinker it to a higher presure if i mod it anyway.
So spending on new parts and the Gagguino Upgrade but would have then a fully controllable machine.

Since I have no clue how modable the Anna is and if it is even necessary, i would like to hear your objectiv opinion.

This machine would be to get into the topic and learn.

I'd use it mostly for single espressi or for short lattes.
I have a casual machine for my ""long"" coffes...

I like medium roasts...don't like if the coffee is to acidic or sour.

A few days ago my family had a function to scatter his ashes and have a final moment with him, say goodbye etc etc. this is all happening outside, but I go inside the house to make myself some coffee. Mind you this is only about 10 or so metres from where everyone else is. 

While I'm inside making coffee they proceed to scatter his ashes without me, without even bothering to call me to come out and be a part of it. (They've called for as little as someone blowing out candles on a birthday cake btw)

Option A: They purposefully didn't call me (which I think is unlikely)
Option B: The thought of calling me to be a part of my own uncle's ashes being scattered simply didn't cross their mind, and not one of them, all of them. All of them didn't even bother when it would've taken 2 seconds to call.

How do I get over it?,"We met on an app, we had a really good first date and even better subsequent ones, and also sex on the first date, which isn't always a big deal because most of the time it fizzles out quickly. But this was one of the rare times it didn't. I never felt such a strong connection to someone since my last long term relationship, which ended more than 3 years ago. I've had quite a fair few first dates ending in sex in the last 10 years or so, and I would say I'm pretty experienced with casual dating as well as more serious relationships (I've had 2 serious LTRs and 3 slightly less serious but not casual, shorter but just as important to me). Not trying to toot my own horn, I'm not perfect and still have lots to learn. Overall we must have spent maybe 3 whole days together in the first week? And we've realised we have very similar love languages. Honestly, there's not a thing I didn't enjoy about her, from a physical, spiritual, political, mental standpoint... you name it.

We've been for walks around the city, cooked together, for each other, been to coffee places we wanted to check out, vintage shopping, we were supposed to go to the cinema last week and I wanted to take her to a political rally in solidarity for asylum seekers and possibly a dance event in the night this past weekend. She said yes to all those things and always seemed keen, and so was I. I had not been this enthusiastic about someone in a very long time, and I like this feeling, especially after a long string of post break-up casual dating that took a year of my time and just killed my motivation to try too hard for someone. In fact, I stopped dating for 6 months altogether between Sept last year and March this year. Since then, she's been the second person I've dated, which is a big change from the situation I was in before I took a break from dating. I've never appreciated more than now the say ""less is more""

She has told me about some past sexual trauma that really marked her so I took care to be extra careful. I asked her if she felt safe around me twice and twice I got a positive, honest response, and while I can't verify how real her yes was, I trusted her. The thing is, this trauma was perpetuated by someone of very similar ethnicity to mine, probably a different mix, so it does make me overthink, but she didn't mention this as a reason she wanted to stop seeing me for - or rather, *needed* to stop. In fact, her reasons for breaking up were that we were too different as people, and that I am not so politically active as her, despite sharing the vast majority of political views. I'm more of a moderate overall and have been to protests here and there for matters that really touch me deeply but I really value communication, discussion and conversation to solve issues, whereas she's much more of an activist and much more ""politicised"" than me, quoting her.

I've been left with a very bitter aftertaste. I've never had a rejection based on something like this, her saying that we're way too different when all I could see were our similarities has really left a sinking feeling in my chest in the last few days. The political aspect of it, again, I didn't think we were so dissimilar, but she thought otherwise. She broke up 10 days ago with me but only started thinking about this this last weekend just gone. My instinct is saying something about it ain't right and there's pieces to the story missing. We did go from 0 to 100 and back to 0 quite dramatically, but I've never been so unable to handle these emotions than now. I just don't understand where this lack of control of my emotions comes from, what can I do? Has anyone been in a situation that felt so unjust?

Maybe I just need a slap in the face and an ice bath and I'll wake up again.

TLDR: she left me over what I consider a slight political divergence and under the pretext that we are very different people despite actually sharing a lot of political views, just our approach to politics is different: I'm more moderate, she's more of an activist. Our life experiences are indeed different, but the fact that we were able to understand each other's joys and pains when talking about it made me think there was somewhere this could have gone.",1,1734450267.0,dating_advice,2,0.67,False

Ever wished your bathroom was as comfy as your favorite armchair? Well, it's time to make that wish a reality! Welcome to our deep dive into the world of ergonomic bathrooms. We've spent countless hours (and yes, that's a hint of humor) testing and reviewing to bring you the best ergonomic bathroom finds. So, grab your favorite beverage and let's embark on this cozy adventure!
  
  
## The Art of Ergonomics: What's in a Name?

When you hear the word ""ergonomic,"" it might sound like something a fancy professor dreamed up in a stuffy university. But, oh boy, it’s so much more than that! Ergonomics is all about making our lives easier, especially in spaces we use daily—like our bathrooms. Imagine sinking into a bath that feels custom-made for you, like a warm hug after a long day. Trust me, it’s pure bliss!

So, what does “ergonomic” really mean? It refers to design that focuses on comfort, efficiency, and usability for our bodies. It’s about creating a space that loves you right back, instead of making you twist and turn like a pretzel. You know those moments when you reach for something and feel like you’re performing acrobatics? Yeah, those days are gone in a well-thought-out ergonomic space.

One classic example is a toilet at the right height—no more awkward squats! Plus, think about vanities designed to keep all your essentials within arm's reach. I wish someone had told me about this sooner when I was on a wild treasure hunt for my toothbrush amidst a chaos of products. Honestly, who decided bathrooms should be so cluttered?

Incorporating ergonomic elements like soft-close cabinets or non-slip flooring turns your bathroom into more than just a washroom. It becomes a serene retreat. Now, who wouldn’t want that kind of spa-like atmosphere in their own home? Why settle for ordinary when we can turn our daily routines into a relaxed experience?

## Toilets: The Throne's Ergonomic Evolution

Toilets, my friends, are not just places for business; they are the unsung heroes of our daily lives. Think about it—when was the last time you sat on one and didn’t wonder if it was the kind of comfortable throne your royal self deserves? You laugh, but this is serious business! The evolution of toilets has transformed them from mere porcelain pots into ergonomic marvels, and it’s about time we gave the humble loo the applause it deserves.

First on the list is the height. Standard toilets can often feel like you're plummeting down a rabbit hole. The good news? Many modern commodes are designed with various heights to fit your stature, ensuring you don’t feel like you need a parachute when you sit down. And can we talk about shape? Yes, you heard me right. Round bowls? So yesterday. Elongated shapes offer better support and are often more comfortable for extended visits. Think of it as advanced chair technology for your behind. 

Now, let’s discuss the seating. Some models come with soft-close lids which, let’s be honest, save you from that dreaded toilet seat slam that wakes up the whole house like a coffee-fueled toddler. You also get options with cushioned seats that cradle you like a warm hug. Who knew your bathroom could feel like a spa? Feeling comfy while in a negotiating position with gravity? Count me in!

## Sinks: Washing Up in Style and Comfort

Ever leaned over a sink that's just a tad too high, or worse, too low? Oh boy, it's like playing a bizarre game of twister while washing your hands, except you’re not quite sure if you’ll win or just end up with a sore back. Trust me, I’ve been there. There’s nothing ergonomic about contorting your body just to reach the faucet when you could be feeling like a king or queen in your own bathroom. 

When it comes to sinks, the height is everything. The ideal height depends on your own stature. Too high? You’ll be stretching and possibly even channeling your inner yoga master. Too low? Well, hello, back pain! Finding that sweet spot is like striking gold—once you do, every wash feels like a mini spa experience. 

But wait, there's more! The design also makes a huge difference. I’ve seen sinks that look like they belong in a sci-fi movie, and honestly, they can be quite the conversation starter. Just imagine showing off a sleek, minimalist sink that doubles as a piece of modern art. 

And let’s not forget about materials! Stainless steel, porcelain, or even bamboo—you can find an option that feels like home and fits your style. So, what’s your dream sink like? Do you picture something super sleek, or are you leaning more toward rustic charm?

## Baths and Showers: The Wet Room Wonder

Imagine stepping into a bathroom that feels more like a calming oasis than just a place to scrub off the day’s grime. Ergonomic baths and showers are all the rave, making every splash feel like a pampering visit to a fancy spa without the hefty price tag—or the awkward small talk. I mean, who needs to discuss the weather with strangers while soaking in bubbles, am I right?

You wouldn’t believe the simple yet brilliant features these wet rooms offer. Firstly, take the showerheads: they don’t just shoot water; they create soothing rainfall effects. You can literally stand under it, close your eyes, and pretend you’re in a tropical paradise. It’s practically a mini vacation! And let’s not forget the benches—you know, those nifty little additions that are perfect for lounging or shaving legs without doing karate moves in the tub.

Now, if you’re anything like me, the idea of slippery tiles makes you a bit jumpy. Thankfully, many ergonomic designs incorporate non-slip surfaces. I once had a friend who had a “slip and slide” moment—let’s just say she was very lucky. Also, adjustable faucets mean you can tweak the water temperature without doing the “dance of the scalded arm.” 

So grab a bath bomb and let’s dive into the possibilities. You might just find that making every shower feel like a lavish treat is easier than you ever thought!

## Storage: The Unsung Heroes of Ergonomics

When we think about bathroom ergonomics, storage often gets relegated to the backseat, crammed in between the soap dish and the towel rack. Yet, proper storage could be, dare I say, the unsung hero of transforming your bathroom into a truly ergonomic space. Trust me on this one; I've experienced the chaos of a cluttered bathroom. It's like a soap opera—drama everywhere! 

Imagine, if you will, stylish cabinets that not only look good but are designed so you don’t have to bend like a pretzel to find your favorite shampoo. I once reached into a high cabinet and knocked over a mountain of lotions. What a mess! So, low-profile cabinets can make all the difference—no more dangerous hair products dropping like they’re in an action movie. 

And let’s not forget shelves. Not just any shelves, but ones that utilize every little nook and cranny. I’ve seen some brilliant designs that are shallow enough to hold just the essentials, keeping everything within arm's reach while looking sleek. Adding pull-out drawers is also a game-changer. It’s like having your own magic trick where you can make things appear and disappear without the arm gymnastics. 

Storage solutions don’t have to be boring; they can incorporate stylish baskets or colorful bins making them like little art pieces in your bathroom. All this while keeping your space organized, tidy, and, most importantly, efficient. Now tell me, wouldn’t you prefer a spa-like atmosphere where everything is effortlessly at hand?

## Lighting and Layout: The Final Ergo Touches

Lighting and layout can truly make or break your ergonomic bathroom. Let me tell you, I learned this the hard way. The first time I tried to create a relaxing space, I ended up with a blinding light that felt more like a horror movie than a spa retreat. Ever tried to unwind while feeling like a deer in headlights? Not ideal! 

You want soft, warm lighting to set the mood. Think about those flickering candles—oh, how I love those! They create the perfect ambiance for a bubble bath or just for pondering life’s greatest mysteries, like why my favorite socks always disappear in the wash. It’s also crucial to have layered lighting. Overhead lights can be harsh, but adding sconces or even LED strips under your cabinets can provide a gentle glow that calms the senses. 

Now, onto layout! Ensure that everything flows seamlessly. You don’t want to be doing a weird dance to reach your soap when you’re half asleep. Clever nooks for your essentials make everything accessible and pleasant. Also—don’t overlook the importance of having a well-placed mirror. A strategically hung mirror not only helps reflect light but can also make your space feel larger. It’s like magic! A little planning in lighting and layout turns your bathroom into an oasis. Who knew being comfy could be this fun?

## Conclusions
  
  
And there you have it, folks! We've explored, we've laughed, and we've learned. Now it's time to transform your bathroom into a cozy oasis. Remember, ergonomic isn't just a buzzword - it's about creating a space that's not only stylish but also kind to your body. So, go forth and create your own little slice of heaven. Until next time, happy ergonomic exploring!",1,1734449815.0,EverythingErgonomic,0,1.0,False

I'm the artistic director of [IMPRO Amsterdam](https://www.impro-amsterdam.nl), a huge (8 day, 30 show, 60 workshops) festival in, unsurprisingly, Amsterdam.

One of the things we are trying this year is creating a community space where people can hang out and interact when they're not in workshops. We landed a rad space - an old decommissioned church with two separate rooms, a lounge with couches, and tables and chairs.

We want to stock the space with activity options that bring people together in ways that are improv-adjacent. 

Current ideas:
- coffee and tea
- board games
- DM-less, short TTRPGs
- a button-making station
- a zine-making station with a little bookshelf where you can see what other people have made
- a photographer who you can book headshot slots with
- a wall with weird found photos that you can caption with post-its
- a cork board where people can post whatever (join me on a trip to this museum, etc)

I'd LOVE to hear your ideas for other (ideally low-cost) things that we can set up. The fest is in February so we have a little time... Got any ideas?",4,1734449814.0,improv,0,1.0,False

1hgd4xc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SuperiorPromos/comments/1hgd4xc/top_5_reasons_why_promotional_products_offer_the/,TOP 5 REASONS Why Promotional Products Offer the Best ROI for Your Advertising Budget,"If you're looking for the most **cost-effective way to advertise**, promotional products are hands-down the best investment. Unlike traditional advertising methods like TV, digital ads, or billboards, promotional items deliver unmatched **value for cost** while offering long-term brand exposure.

Here’s why promotional products are the ultimate bang for your advertising buck:

1. **Low Cost Per Impression (CPI):** Promotional products have some of the **lowest costs per impression** in the marketing world. For example, a branded pen or tote bag might cost less than $1 to produce, but every time someone uses it, your brand gets exposure. Compare that to digital ads that charge per click or TV commercials that cost thousands for just seconds of airtime.
   * **Example:** A single $5 branded coffee tumbler could be used daily for years, leading to hundreds, if not thousands, of impressions—at fractions of a cent per view.
2. **Long-Lasting Advertising:** Unlike ads that disappear after a few seconds or get ignored, promotional products are **useful** and **stick around**. Think about a tote bag carried to the store, a t-shirt worn at the gym, or a branded notebook brought to meetings. These items keep your brand in front of customers for months, sometimes years.
3. **Tangible and Functional:** People **like receiving free items**—especially when they’re practical. From pens and water bottles to umbrellas and apparel, promo products are things people use daily. Your logo becomes part of their daily routine without feeling intrusive like some forms of advertising.
4. **Higher Recall and Impact:** Studies show that **83% of people remember the advertiser** on a promotional product they’ve received. Compare that to banner ads that most people ignore or TV commercials they fast-forward. A useful product creates a positive association with your brand.
5. **Wide Reach:** Promotional items don’t just advertise to one person—they travel. A branded tote bag in a grocery store is seen by dozens of people. A hat worn in public is noticed by strangers. Your reach grows exponentially for the same small cost.

At [**SuperiorPromos.com**](https://www.superiorpromos.com/), we specialize in high-quality, cost-effective promotional products that deliver **real results**. Whether you're looking for branded pens, custom mugs, t-shirts, or tote bags, we help you make a **lasting impression** without breaking your advertising budget.

If you're ready to maximize your ROI and get your brand noticed, promotional products are the way to go. Check us out at [**SuperiorPromos.com**](http://SuperiorPromos.com) and start advertising smarter, not harder!

1hgcwsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hgcwsb/i_think_my_roommate_gets_angry_too_quickly_and_it/,I think my roommate gets angry too quickly and it annoys me,"
My roommate (29F) and I (29F) have been living together for a year. We’re actually really close, but I’ve started realizing that I can’t stand some of her habits anymore. I’m not sure if it’s her being too aggressive or if there’s something wrong with me. Sometimes I feel like she overreacts to things.

Let’s call my roommate Sally.

Our washing machine is at the very bottom of our building. Today, when I went to do laundry, I forgot to take my key with me, so when I came back up, I couldn’t get inside and had to ring the doorbell. Sally came to the door, looking pissed off, and said, “Ugh, why don’t you take your key? I was on the phone.” I apologized and said I forgot, asking why she was yelling. She responded with, “Because you always do this.” I’ll admit, I’m forgetful, but in the entire year we’ve lived together, maybe I’ve forgotten my key twice when going to do laundry. So I said, “Always? This has happened once or twice, that’s it.” She looked at me, annoyed, as if she didn’t believe me.

For example, this weekend we’re having a Christmas dinner where everyone is bringing a few dishes. There will be four of us, so plenty of food. One of our friends said she was planning to make apple cookies, and Sally immediately said, “I don’t like apple cookies at all, can you make something else?” Our friend replied that she didn’t know how to make anything else because she usually doesn’t cook (she lives with her family). I could see my friend getting stressed, and since there will be plenty of other food, I stepped in and said, “Actually, I like them, and maybe Melanie (our fourth friend) does too.” Sally got really upset and snapped, “Yeah, but I don’t like them, wouldn’t it be better if we all had something we like?” She looked super mad while saying this.

Later, Sally mentioned she’d be using pork for a dish she wanted to make, and our other friend said she doesn’t eat pork. Sally replied, “Okay, then you just won’t eat that. There’s plenty of other stuff.”

Another time, I told her we could share milk because I only use a little bit in my coffee, and the cartons are big, so most of it goes bad. At first, she agreed, but the next day she changed her mind. I ended up getting used to drinking coffee without milk. Then, the other day, I needed milk for my protein powder and asked if she had any. She immediately snapped, “This is why we don’t share milk, because you never buy it.” But she was the one who didn’t want to share it in the first place, and we never even followed through with it!

TLDR: my friend gets annoyed by simple things but she doesn’t like to be treated the same way.

Kind of chemically and a little bit sour? The foam is also less thick and tends to dissipate and get watery quickly. 

Anyway, I dug out the descaling kit today and went through the cycle and then just rinsed it a bunch of times. I then made a few cups of coffee because I know the descaling can make the first few cups after taste strange. But even after that the issue remains. Is there anything I can do?

Baby slept great until the 6 month regression + teething combination. It’s gotten a lot better, we used to wake literally 10 times a night. Now, he’s sleeping from 8/9pm - 2am, and then wakes every 1.5-2 hours until he’s up for the day around 7:30-8:30am. Dad works full time, i’m currently sahm trying to start a small business from home but struggling to get started because i feel like i have no time for myself. I usually have to sleep next to my son for the remainder of the night to keep myself sane the next day. I miss my bed lol. Anyway, I feel like it’s starting to slowly (VERY slowly) improve so i’m trying to stay hopeful. 
Any tips/tricks that helped your kiddos sleep longer stretches again? 

Also, he’s never been away from us for more than a few hours. He hasn’t spent the night anywhere, or spent even the day away from us. Maybe 4 hours or so. When did you have your first baby free night? I have so much anxiety about him not being with me. The long stressful night that i need a break from, is the same thing holding me back from accepting my moms offers to keep him overnight. I know he’d be very well taken care of, of course!! I don’t know what it is.

I’m desperate to wake up in my bed one morning. and make my coffee and work on my business plans. and genuinely just not feel constant stress because i dread night time and how long the next day will be lol. 

The mom guilt is also intense. I feel guilty even just typing these things. I love my son and wouldn’t trade mom life for anything. He’s the light of my life and although the days are so hard i love spending every minute with him.

1hgcomu,https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/comments/1hgcomu/i_refuse_to_associate_with_anyone_who_isnt/,I refuse to associate with anyone who isn’t educated at a PhD level. Is the problem me?,"Hello all,

I’m seeking some advice: I refuse to associate with anyone who isn’t educated at a PhD level. Is the problem me? In the spirit of maintaining healthy boundaries, a fellow PhD holder and redditor once said: “Nay, I shall never sully mine own hand” and I also feel that way about meeting and associating with normal people.

Some backstory: Last week I was standing in a KFC waiting for my zinger burger combo order when I yanked myself away from the onset of a state of boundless rage; I had my right index finger pointed at the pimply 14-year-old kid serving me, and my whole being was trembling. I was muttering, “Where’s your PhD? Well? Where is it?” A few onlookers-customers had their phones out ready to call the police. I was utterly livid because the KFC kid had called out my first name and missed my honorific, which I had included in my order at the self-service kiosk. I managed to squash my rage for a while – enough to compose myself and collect my zinger burger from the counter and correct the clueless kid (It’s *Dr.* *Dr* James) – and as I was walking out the door I had a moment of pristine clarity. I realised I have some things to work through via the r/PhD subreddit which is basically just a giant, decentralised, collective therapy session.

It all started when I ascertained that a childhood friend only had a master’s degree and even though he made several earnest attempts to meet up for a coffee, I blocked his number and immediately ruled out ever seeing him again because of his educational shortcomings. I initially felt guilty and petty for my stance, however, as I continued to remove non-PhD holders and candidates alike from my life with surgical precision, I realised my convictions were helping me more than they were hurting me.

It’s gotten to the point where I’ve made a spreadsheet with a cell dedicated to every single person I meet. Each person must fulfill criteria such as having already attained a doctoral education (or being in a doctoral program) and they must be aligned with my own highly specific research interests and disciplinary aperture. If the person fails to meet these criteria, I cut them out of my life and put a line through their name on the spreadsheet.

Let’s call my approach social distancing from non-PhD holders.

My social sphere is less like a sphere and more like a crumpled topological splinter that’s somehow narrower than my dissertation’s readership. You know that saying – I think it was Mark Manson or Sophocles or some other white male who writes books and does YouTube – “Only associate with others that you aspire to be like and if they don’t meet your criteria, draw a line through their name on an Excel spreadsheet and never associate with them again.” I might be paraphrasing a bit but that was the gist of the quote.

The way I see it, my spreadsheet is unshackling me from the cerebral cul-de-sac of dealing with my family members, friends, and members of the public who haven’t pursued a heightened intellectual pursuit in an incredibly narrow disciplinary aperture. A few examples of encounters I’ve had recently with less educated types that curdle my blood:

·        A family member recently asked me: “What are you doing on the weekend?” I scoffed and said: “Doing? How could I talk about doing without also talking about ‘being’, ‘thinking’, and ‘feeling’? Implicit in your question is the assumption that doing is somehow separate from these other evolving states and processes; instead, they are all intertwined in processes of becoming, where each is part of a dynamic, performative mattering that is constantly in flux.” I scoffed a second time and felt the third coming on (like a cascade of scoffs) and said: “You haven’t read much Karen Barad, have you?” before walking off to edit my spreadsheet.

·        On another occasion, a homeless man came up to me and said: “Do you have the time?” I said: “It depends on what you mean by ‘have’ and ‘time’…” and after a long line of questioning I found out that this person believed in a particular model of clockwork temporality that is at odds with the implications of quantum entanglement. The man hadn’t considered this at all nor challenged his ‘possessive’ and unfortunately colonial attitude towards time. In the end, I found out the person’s name under the false premise of help and support and wrote it in my spreadsheet to ensure I would never associate with him again. What a close call.

Anyway, all thoughts are welcome as long as they validate my stance on the matter. Some people have said I alienate others, but I refuse to believe the problem is me. Should I carry on as is or adjust my expectations? I am leaning towards the former. Your advice is welcome if (and only if) it’s aligned with what I say and believe. Do you have any similar stories of not wanting to associate with normal people?

This is a song from Bo Burnham’s comedy special: Inside (2021), where he talks about the stereotypical white woman’s Instagram where white women are either ignorant or willfully dismissive of the world’s problems by creating an idyllic fabrication of reality. Throughout the song, he appears in vignettes reminiscent of the aforementioned stereotypes. the song primarily consists of a single long list of cliched instagram content associated with white female influencers and these highly curated images (which we are very familiar)  of joy, consumerism, and relaxation that project a lifestyle of comfort and unending happiness.

I can't tell whether I'm being too paranoid or if she's cheating. There's a whole laundry list of odd acts on her part, but right now everything is looking like this.

So yesterday I'm at her place, I'm planning on going to a coffee shop, she's working from home, so I offer to take a package to the post office. I ask her what the package is and she tells me some weird ass story about her friend's boyfriend leaving it there to hide it from her friend like a Christmas gift. I'm like wtf? And I say I'm certain you're lying wtf are you talking about and she comes clean. Says it's actually a package she's sending to some dude she saw a couple times before we got together because he gave her legos and was hounding her for them back.

So she got caught lying. She's trying to prove her second story and sends me her call list from Halloween. On Halloween I had been at a party and she had been out with her friends. The party ended up in the city so I was gonna try to meet her. I call her and text her and she's like ""I'm going home."" Thought that was weird but it was about 1am and she had work the next day. Now, in her call list from Halloween, there are calls with some other guy at the same time I had been calling her.

I found in her recently deleted texts one from that same night where he said ""yo wya"" at around the time I was calling her. She had deleted it! So she was lying again! 

Now she's trying to convince me I'm wrong and ruining the relationship over paranoia. Saying ""he's just a friend who comes out with us sometimes - I told u I went home."" But I feel it's all bullshit. ",1,1734448072.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

**Hyatt Regency Princeton**: 8/10. Pleasantly surprised. First time staying at the a HR and pretty good experience. Came here for work for 1-night stay and room was nice, clean and comfortable. Plenty of parking to self-park, mediocre gym, outdoor pool which I didn't use. Right off the highway so you need a car realistically to get anywhere so don't think of walking into town for dinner or anything.

**Les Regalia in Corsica (Mr & Mrs Smith):** 2/10. Came here for my birthday for 3-nights. Beautiful hotel -- very high end rooms and amenetities however terrible guest service experience with management. Truly worst hotel experience ever. It is a relatively new hotel, so everything was very performative, and the staff was all up in your business which I understand but it felt a bit suffocating. The staff was incredibly kind and gave us drinks upon check-in for my birthday. However the nightmare began shortly after as we had issue with the chair upon check-in that broke and they managed to charge us for the cost of repair. There were clearly issues with the plumping as well as the wall around the toilet started to crack and they tried to charge us for the cost of repair as well. The GM and owner of the hotel (family run) cornered me at the front desk in front of other guests and asked me if I had an accident in the toilet and asked me to just file a claim with my travel insurance which I did not have... charged me over $2k for damages and repairs and ended up filing a claim with Chase towards the end. Never again.

**Hyatt Place New York / Chelsea**: 6/10. Small rooms however beautiful views of the city. Elevators took forever. Breakfast was meh and nothing to rave about. Great location though and accessibly to all things downtown which was great.

**Dream Downtown** **(NYC**): 8/10. Great location in meatpacking. Lots of restaurants nearby and easy walking to all things downtown has to offer. I was upgraded to a room with a balcony which was great during the summer. My room was nice although bathroom was a bit tight. TV connected with Chromecast and great pool in the summer even though it gets PACKED as lots of day passers come.

**Dream Midtown (NYC)**: 5/10. Close to CP and Times Square which is fine if that is what you prefer but I would choose Downtown location over Midtown. Room was tiny and bathrooms were even smaller. Elevators are super tight and cramped --- gave me claustrophobia and a lot of anxiety. The GM and staff were amazing though because after sharing my woes with the elevator they offered to move me down to a lower floor so that I could access the stairs easily. Wonderful staff, free waters to pick up at the front desk. Access to TMPL gymes since they don't have a gym which was super nice. Due to elevator situation and unideal location (for my personal preference) giving it a 5/10.

**Chicago Athletic Association**: 9/10. Came here for a wedding for 2 nights. Lovely hotel and amenities. Awesome restaurants and bars right in the hotel Very dark room but clean, comfortable and great location in Chicago. Would stay here again.

**Hotel 50 Bowery**: 8/10. Clean, sunny, comfortable room. Location was nothing to rave about. You're at the cross of major roads getting over the bridge so lot of traffic and noise. Fine hotel -- great rooms and amenities but not my first choice for location.

**Hyatt Centric Delfina Santa Monica**: 9/10. Great room -- comfortable, clean, upgraded with a balcony. While not right off the Pier, easy walking distance to the beach. Great staff -- ok amenities but walking distance to great coffee shops and gyms. Would easily stay here again.

**Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami**: 8/10. Great location in South Beach -- shared amenities with the Loewes. Room was nice and comfortable. Didn't use the pool but the shared amenities with the Loewes was amazing.

**Hyatt Place New York City / Times Square**: 7/10. Back to back stays here. Great staff -- fine HP. I would choose the HP Chelsea over TS just for personal preference to location.

1hgcgm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1hgcgm6/luminarias_focus/,Luminaria’s Focus,"This was inspired by a [writing prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1hcu10b/the_final_fleet/) on this subreddit.

Every sea is different. You don’t need to spend much time traveling the waters of the galaxy to learn that. When I was young, I’d thought the Atlantic and the Pacific were as different as could be. That was before I saw the shores of oceans on other planets. Earth didn’t have shores like the one I was walking past this morning. Green sand, eroded from green glass, in turn forged by a nuclear explosion that had altered the planet’s orbit. An extreme terraforming technique, but it had worked. Thousands of orbits later, the planet faced a new threat. Invasion. In orbit were thousands of Naga warships. They’d given their customary “warning” they’d shoot down any ships trying to escape. They’d land and begin eating us in two days.

I looked towards my destination, the lighthouse ahead. The only human on the planet, my neighbors had asked me if there was anything I could do to help. One of them, a war widower named Galdar, had asked, “Dude, you’re a Beach Mage, that’s got to be good for something, right? Our planet’s got a LOT of beaches.”

“Most my magic is about calming storms, healing the injured, dealing with aquatic curses, that sort of thing. Alien invasion isn’t in my wheelhouse.”

“I don’t know what that idiom means, and I do NOT have patience for the translator’s ‘Background information’ mode.”

“I briefed the military on my abilities as part of emigrating here. I’m on tap to- er, I’ve been put on standby for healing the sick and injured but-”

“They’re not bombarding our cities or trying to seize the planet. They’re a war fleet here to eat us and take the rest of us prisoner as snacks for later. You gotta have SOMETHING to help when they land.”

“I need to think about that. There might be something in my archives.”

I’d gone back inside and started work. My ancestors would be green with envy if they could see me using a digital grimoire. Being able to keyword search thousands of pages of magic made a year’s worth of research take days. Having only a day-and-a-half left meant I needed every advantage I could get. The news media was optimistic about the planetary defenses holding out long enough for reinforcements to arrive, but there were literally enough Naga in orbit to eat the planet’s entire population. All they needed was one hole to start landing.

I’m not sure how long I’d been up researching when I fell asleep but I remember the dream I had. I was at the top of a cliff, walking towards a lighthouse. I had materials with me for making something that on Earth would be ancient and ready, stored in a location known to the Lighthouse keeper. None had ever been made on this planet. It was up to me to make one. It was up to me to use it. Only a human would DARE make one. I woke from the dream drenched in sweat and terrified. As I reached for the light, my hand clasped on a piece of rolled up-parchment. It was a very specific shade of lavender typical of scrolls that manifest by magic. I unrolled it, and found the list of materials and the rituals I needed all neatly spelled out and itemized under the heading “Luminaria’s Focus.”

That’s one of the downsides to magic. Sometimes your dreams give you homework.

I’d gotten to work gathering the materials I’d need. Most of them were rather mundane, but a few would take some negotiation, like “hair of a recently drowned man.” For that, I’d need to speak to Miltonia. I cleaned up, changed, and headed outside into the pre-dawn city. The air smelled clean and crisp, the sky just starting to have the almost indistinct lightening that comes when dawn is almost here. I wasn’t sure how I felt about how quiet it was. I knew it was a sleeping world I walked in, but it already felt dead. From some dark recess of my mind came unbidden the image of the city in a few days time if the Naga landed and fed. It was as quiet as it was now, but everything was shifted towards destruction. Shattered windows where victims had been dragged from their homes. Blood. So much blood. Horrors from aftermath images I’d seen in the media lept from my memory and plastered themselves obscenely on the city around me. 

I’d stopped, closed my eyes, and pressed the heels of my hand against my temples. I needed to focus. I hadn’t slept much in the last few days and I needed to stay on task. I was standing there, thinking, when I was startled by a voice behind me.

“Duuuuude!”

I’d yelped in surprise, turned, and seen the Pilz who’d spoken to me. “Saltar,” I’d said. “Why are you up this early?”

“One of my ancestors came to me in a vision.”

“I had no idea you’d progressed that far in your training already! I’m impressed.”

“I haven’t progressed that far. They reached out to me.”

The living reaching out to the dead is a matter of ritual and skill. The dead reaching out to the living without an established channel? That takes a LOT of moving and shaking from the other side. “What can you tell me?” I’d asked.

“She said you had ocean magic from Earth that might save us and I needed to help you.”

“You know what I said about how some ancestors aren’t necessarily helpful when you contact them?”

“Yeah?”

“Whoever talked to you is the exact opposite of that. When you start reaching out to your ancestors, start with her. Come on. We need to see if Miltonia is up.”

I’d been out of coffee and tea for weeks, but adrenaline had put a new spring in my step. Saltar was nearly running to keep up. In a couple blocks we were close enough to see lights at Miltonia’s. As we reached the door, I saw her in a window, pacing and carrying one of her twins. 

Saltar waved at her through the window, but she didn’t seem to notice him. I went up to her front door and knocked gently. A few moments later the door opened and a very tired Miltonia looked out at us.

“Saltar?” she’d said, “What are you doing up so early?”

Saltar jumped in and started speaking animatedly, recounting his vision and then seeing me on the street. 

Miltonia looked towards me. Exhaustion was etched into her features. Her skin was normally a vibrant pattern of reds and greens swirling around her as if she were a painting of a storm. Her colors were faded now. It was the most noticeable in her face, where the pigmentation had faded to a pearly white around her eyes. 

“Hold on a minute,” she said. She’d stepped back into her home, still carrying the sleeping child. A few moments later she emerged again carrying a small jar. She held it out to me, and I accepted it.

“Thank you,” I’d begun.

“Oh shut up,” she said. “Sorry, not mad at you, mad at the invasion. I was asleep and I got visited by one of my ancestors too. A Great-Grandfather. Great guy, knew him in life. Told me you needed my husband’s remains for a spell that might save us. Told me about your drunken confession to Galdar. We’ll talk about that when you’re done with saving the world. Now git.” She closed the door.

“What was your drunken confession?” Saltar had asked, amused.

I pocketed the jar, turned, and started walking. “Keep up, we’ll talk while we walk. I was expecting that to be a big hard conversation where I’d have to persuade her. You guys have really proactive ancestors.” 

“The Confession?”

“I’m in love with her, but don’t have the guts to act on it because I was friends with her husband.”

“What the Frell would THAT have to do with it?”

“That’s pretty much what Galdar said.”

“Did you give him an answer?”

“About what?”

“The life of everyone on this planet is in the hands of the most clueless human in history.”

“Oh shut up.”

“If you have feelings for her, what are you waiting for?”

“Her husband only died last season.”

“What’s the human idiom? ‘Oh My God.’ That’s it. That’s the human way to say what I’m feeling right now. ‘I can’t even’ might work too.”

“Is there something I’m missing?”

“She’s a widow with kids.”

“I’m still not getting it.”

“How long would be OK to wait among humans?”

“It varies, but people usually wait a few months, sometimes a few years, before they start dating again.”

“OK, what are months and years?” 

“Seven days in a week, four weeks in a month, fifty-two weeks in a year.”

“Frell man, that’s insane. ”

“So what’s normal with the Pilz?”

“If you have kids and your partner dies, a couple of these ‘weeks’ you use would be normal.”

“What’s having kids got to do with it?”

“Dude, if you’re willing to step up and be a step-parent, you could have proposed the day after the funeral and been a walking romantic trope.”

“Then why’s Miltonia still single?”

“Frell if I know.”

The sun was rising by this point. Our next destination was visible. I gave Saltar some instructions. “We have the first ingredient, ‘Hair of a recently drowned man’.”

“Uh, Dude?”

“What?”

“Pilz don’t HAVE hair.”

“Magic this old leaves a LOT of wiggle-room. Any part of the body will work. Gender doesn’t even matter.”\`

“What’s next?”

“We need ‘sand from a sailor’s graveyard.’”

“A graveyard JUST for sailors?”

“Nah, it’d be specified if it mattered. This is old, deep magic I’m doing. Primordial stuff. You do it with the materials at hand. Speaking of which, we’ve reached the graveyard. Here’s my spade and a bag. Fill the bag with sand from the graveyard, and meet me on the shore, near the bonfire site. That’ll be the safest place to do this.”

“Why’s it safer there?” Saltar had asked, concern in his voice.

“It’s built to hold huge fires and the wind funnels the smoke out to sea.”

“Why do we need a fire?”

I’d hastily explained what making Luminaria’s Focus would involve. I didn’t go into the details of what it did. He started digging and I went to the beach.

“Driftwood” is another broadly defined category, and the native flora, while nothing like Earth’s trees, had plenty of specimens that washed up on shore and could burn. I need to gather a lot.

The sun was well into the sky when the fire was finally burning. Saltar was continuing to gather driftwood so we could keep the fire going. Even so, it took some bellows spells and hoping wet anthracite was close enough to driftwood to get the flames hot enough to melt the sand.

Adding the ashes from the urn was harder than I’d thought it would be. I didn’t even need much of them, but even tipping that little bit felt like I was imprisoning my friend in something dark. I shook my head and prepared the mould in the beach’s green sand. More incantations. Sea salt added to the molten glass. Finally, after more rounds of additions and incantations, we poured the glass into the sand mould, and when it stopped sizzling, ran cold seawater over it.

The magic had warned “The waters of each ocean” would “touch” it, but I hadn’t expected fountains to erupt out of the beach spewing water of wildly varying temperatures and shades. Saltar had observed it was, “Better than having to go to each ocean.”

Having just been soaked in magically transported polar seawater, I’d withheld my opinion. I was chattering too much to speak.

By this point we’d gathered an audience, and word was spreading about “Eldritch Human Magic” being conducted. While humans and Pilz share a lot of cultural traits, I was pleased by the fact that the Pilz, unlike curious humans, myself included, actually kept at safe distance when asked to do so. Another advantage of using the bonfire area was the public beach bathrooms nearby. A cold seawater shower after hours of tending an improvised glass kiln was life-saving.

The last of the “making” part of the magic was finished by sunset. Now we needed to wait for it to cool. Saltar and I made the rounds greeting everyone who’d come to watch. I found myself reassuring friends and neighbors with phrases like “Nothing’s failed. We’re waiting for the glass to cool,” and “No, this isn’t just for show to keep everyone calm.”

Miltonia had come, and brought her children. 

“Any new visions from your ancestors?” I’d asked.

“Not yet,” she’d responded.

I held out her husband’s urn. “Thank you. The ritual did not need much.”

She took the urn and looked into my eyes. I could feel she wanted to say something, so I leaned in, putting my ear close to her mouth. I could have sworn some color had flushed back into her skin for a moment. She said, “You were welcome to it all, and he’d have said the same.”

“We need to talk,” I’d said.

“After you finish this,” she replied. “Focus on saving our asses, and we can talk about what we’re going to do to each other's asses after. Got it?”

I smiled and said, “As you wish.”

She stepped back and did an impression of a human smirk. It’s not something Pilz did naturally, but they could mimic the behavior when they wanted. “I saw that movie in a ‘Human Studies’ class when I was younger.”

“I know,” I replied.

She turned and started walking away. She gestured towards her children and they gathered to her. Before turning a corner on the path she called back, “I saw that movie too!”

Beaches, water, boats, these are the places kind of magic brings me, and they’re the places I’m most comfortable. Friends had brought food, and now I was about to go to sleep on a litter over the magical object I was making. I sent Saltar home to get some sleep. By this point I’d been able to brief the military on what I was doing, so they had a corridor and guards making sure no one messed with what was going on. I fell asleep with the heat of the dying fire to one side, and the heat from the cooling artifact below me. I did not dream. 

That morning I woke from the best sleep I’d gotten since we heard the Naga armada had turned in our direction. It was a low bar, but the night passed it. I sat up and looked around me. I saw the dead fire beside me and the rows of military guards watching me sleep. That’s when the anxiety and terror of the pending invasion came back to the forefront of my mind. I found myself glad I’d been too exhausted to think when I’d gone to sleep the night before.

The last step was unburying it using driftwood that had been gathered for the fire but not burned. Saltar had arrived to help me. It didn’t take long. Soon we’d revealed the thick glass lens; smooth as if polished, and so dark it seemed to swallow light. It was cold to the touch, but the cold seemed to draw something other than heat when you touched it. I wrapped it in the local approximation of linen while Saltar hastily raked the site for any other pieces of glass created by the ritual. We then started up the hill to the lighthouse, where I was when I started this account. 

“What’s next?” Saltar asked as we walked. 

“We put this lens in the lighthouse and light it.”

“That’s it?”

“You remember when I drained a pint of my blood into this thing?”

“Yeah. It’s why I’m carrying this and not you. I’m kinda terrified at the fact you’re still walking.”

“Pffft. A pint’s nothing for most adult humans.”

“So what’s your blood got to do with it?”

“Well, these things need blood to work, not just the hair of a drowned man, but a blood sacrifice. Because one of the makers sacrificed blood in the making, blood won’t be needed to use it.”

“Does blood feature in a lot of human magic?”

“Not in the magic I specialize in.”

“Ohhhh, a human ‘non-answer’ answer. Those are never good.”

“There’s whole schools of magic that focus on blood.”

“Have I mentioned lately I’m glad our species are allies?”

“Only half as often as I say the same thing.”

“Fawning over Miltonia doesn’t count.”

“Oh well then, that cuts the number WAY down.”

Entering the lighthouse and setting up Luminaria’s Focus felt anticlimactic. We had hours left before the Naga were to invade, it was daytime and the sky was clear, so there wasn’t any risk to ships at sea. The lighthouse keeper swapped out the lenses and lit it up. It was such a small, insignificant prelude to what came next.

“Beacon colors vary between worlds,” the lighthouse keeper observed, “Some colors say ‘Keep Away: Danger’, others say, ‘Come Close: Safe Harbor.’ Who can see this light and who does it call?”

“The military didn’t brief you?” I said.

“They just said it was about the invasion.”

“I can only be seen by those lost at sea, and it calls them home.”

“I’m about to see ghost ships, aren’t I?”

—----------------------------------

Miltonia was sitting on the beach, her children running in the green sand. She was gazing up at the lighthouse. Its light went out, and she called her children close. The surface of the water began to swell in strange ways. From it began to emerge the dead of the ocean. Ships, many from war, surfaced in what seemed to be a rewinding of their sinking. Strange spectral mists plug the holes and sealed the damage in the vessels. Some of the ships and the crew were nothing but this tangible mist.

“Will they guard us when the Naga land?” her eldest asked her. 

That’s when the first ships began to sail into the sky. Miltonia smiled and said, “It doesn't look like they’re waiting that long.”

—----------------------------------

“Admiral, sir!”

“Yes.”

“Incoming visuals from the planet.”

“Let’s see who chose being vaporized over being eaten. Put it on screen. Hmmm. Odd ships. How many have we shot down? There’s a lot of them.”

“Sir, I haven’t gotten any reports of successful hits. It’s like the weapons pass right thr-”

The ship shuddered as it was struck by something large and heavy. Metal groaned and the sounds of airlocks closing, and failing to close, echoed through the halls, drowning out even the screams of the injured and dying.”

Multiple reports began pouring in from his bridge staff. 

“Admiral, something has rammed us!”

“We’ve been boarded! We’ve been boarded!”

“We’ve lost Engineering Three. The whole thing is just GONE.”

He heard the bridge’s hatch grinding. Something was forcing it open. There were calls for help from the other side, Were his own troops trying to get in, or was this the boarding party?” He was still frozen in terror when the calls for help turned to screams of terror, followed by silence.

The Admiral and his entire bridge crew stared at the door, waiting. The pings of damage reports coming in from other ships in the armada were growing in frequency, unread and unheeded. The Admiral was staring at the center of the circular door, his eyes beginning to lose focus, when a ghostly arm passed through the door as if the door itself were an illusion. It threw a spectral hunting knife, which struck his Executive Officer in the head, killing him instantly. The hand dissolved, as if ceasing to exist. 

Then the rest of the boarding party passed through the closed door.

—----------------------------------

Saltar and I started at water. Ships of all kinds, from military down to single-user civilian ones were diving back under the waves. The sun was setting, and I could hear the lighthouse keeper changing the light back to its customary color.

“I think there’s fewer coming back than left,” Saltar said beside me.

“Well yeah,” I replied. “Once they slay an enemy they’re released from the call of Luminaria’s Focus. What we’re seeing here, is how badly outnumbered the Naga were.”

“These are the drowned who didn’t kill a Naga?”

“Yes.”

The evening sky glittered with an artificial meteor shower of Naga ship parts as they burned up on re-entry. The news was reporting the only surviving Naga had surrendered to Planetary Defense. They’d be sitting out the war in a detention center.

Saltar Said, “So that’s it? We won?”

“Yep. Invasion’s over.”

The lighthouse keeper spoke, “You two head on into town. News reports sound like the whole planet’s partying. That’s a bit much for me, but you two look like social types.” 

We said our good-byes to the lighthouse keeper, leaving the lens in his care. He said he knew where it goes, even though he said he couldn’t remember seeing the spot before.

The city was alive with lights. We’d seen that from the lighthouse, but when we got outside and walked down the hill we heard music of all kinds from all directions. Saltar and I parted ways. He strode out into the night, quickly swallowed by the crowd. I had only one destination in mind, Miltonia’s home. I wove through the festivities, reminded of some of the more outrageous festivals back on Earth. Pilz modesty, never as severe as the average human’s, had slipped into their equivalent of Mardi Gras in New Orleans. The natural collage of colors that made up the average Pilz’s skin were  accented by costumes and drapings with components from across the universe. I even recognized a few ostrich and peacock feathers among the adornments.

Miltonia’s lights were on, and she opened the door almost as soon as I’d knocked. What she was wearing was as close to a sundress as I’d seen in Pilz attire. There was definitely some color back in her skin, but her eyes were still pools in a pale white field.

“Come in,” she said.

“Where are the kids?” I asked as the door clicked closed behind me.

“Most of them are off with friends.”

I sat down on the bench and took off my shoes. “One of the reliable groups, or one of the troublesome groups?”

“All the groups are heading to a celebration bonfire. About that, is there anything dangerous left at the site?”

“What?” No. There may be a few pieces of glass lying around, but they won’t have any harmful powers.”

“Wait, powers?”

“Yeah. Saltar cleaned up most of it, but there might be some bits and bobs we missed. Deep magic like this always creates lesser objects of power.”

“What kind of powers?”

“For this? Improved sense of direction. Sensing dangerous waters. It’s deep, dark magic, but it’s sailors’ magic. Any shards left behind will be about respecting and surviving the water.”

“That’s reassuring.”

The human concept of the “Couch” had caught on like wildfire among the Pilz, and we both plopped down, and then sank into, a typical Pilz couch in her front room. More like a gigantic marshmallow than human furniture, it was as if a precocious child had designed the couch based on a fanciful fairy-story version of what a magical couch might be.

“The babies are upstairs sleeping. Just the two of them and the two of us tonight. I asked the kids to let me know when they leave the bonfire.” She shifted position and put her feet in my lap. “How was your day?”

I smiled and gazed into her eyes. “It was a productive day. How was yours?”

“I took my kids to the beach and saw what I hope will be a once-in-a-lifetime event, and my late spouse used it as cover to appear to me in a vision. Is your jaw OK?”

“What? Oh.” I closed my mouth. “Yeah, that’s what ‘My Jaw hit the floor’ means.”

“So it’s hyperbole and not about falling face-first into the floor?”

“Correct.”

“Neat.”

“So this vision?” I asked.

“It was mostly very private final farewell stuff, but there’s some bits to share.”

“I’m listening.”

“He gave his blessing.”

“His blessing?”

“On the condition we talk about things like mourning periods in our respective cultures in future.”

“Wise words,” I said, as I began rubbing her feet. “I accept his conditions.”

She cooed softly and leaned back on the couch. “Careful,” she said.

“Of what?”

“Of relaxing me to sleep. How do people my own age have the energy to party? Our bodies don’t DO adrenaline the way a human’s does.”

“They don’t have twins.”

“I’m badly outnumbered here.”

“Is that a request for reinforcements?”

“Fuck you,” she laughed. I noticed she said it in English, so the profanity would come through the translators.

“Well,” I said, “If you have the energy for that I’m sure I have enough adrenaline in the tank to oblige.” I stood and started to pick her up.

“What are you doing?” she said laughing.

“Carrying you upstairs of course.”

We were both still laughing when my grip slipped and we slid to the floor against the edge of the couch. She settled into my lap and I on the floor. As our giggling subsided, she wrapped her arms around my neck and leaned her head on my shoulder. I embraced her in return. The stress of the last few days seemed to pour out of us, like water flowing onto the ground. We fell asleep in that position. When we were awakened, it was because the children were returning from the bonfire. I squeezed Miltonia tight as I started to wake, and I heard the kids reacting to the two of us asleep on the floor.

“Oh that is so cute.”

“Took him long enough.”

“So I’m getting a step-dad?”

“I’m checking on the twins and going to bed. You two do the same.”

“You’re not the oldest here.”

“I’m the oldest one AWAKE, and keep your voice down so you don’t wake mom.”

Once the kids had gone upstairs, Miltonia groggily whispered, “Good Kids. Love them.” We waited for the kids to go to bed, and then went upstairs to bed ourselves.",6,1734447619.0,humansarespaceorcs,3,1.0,False

GW 190  (I'm just over 6'2"")

Lost 23 lbs in the 10 weeks since I started.     He told me ""you'll probably lose 2-3 lbs per week"" and I lost 2.3 lbs per week.    

And I just came back from a 6 day business trip/meeting to the Big Island (Hawaii) where they fed us REALLY well and, of course, alcohol was readily available.    That trip really put this miracle drug to the test and it passed with flying colors.    There was a huge breakfast spread each morning.   2 of the days I just ate my protein bar in my room and had some coffee.   The other days I had one modest plate with eggs, sausage, etc.. Maybe 400-500 calories max (I'm sure in the past I'd wolf down 1000 calories making 2-3 trips).    I consumed about 8 drinks over the 6 days.  On previous similar trips, it would have been more like 4-5 drinks per day.    In the end, I still managed to lose 1 lb that week which is a minor miracle all things considered.",9,1734447481.0,Zepbound,0,1.0,False

I hope my review helps.  
  
From April 2023 0 -> B2 Dec 2024 while working a full time job and having a life  
  
My partner is native and his family speaks only German, so I am in for a treat every coffee and dinner, so you understand my motivation is intertwined with desperation, I am also looking for a job here in Germany after immigrating from my Eastern European home and quitting my job and confort zone in the name of love.  
  
My journey with Lingoda started in April 2023, I started with a Sprint, my advice: it's only worth it if you have the the certainty you can attend every f day.  
  
Lingoda, itself, it's a great platform with very good teachers, serious classmates and thorough rules that kind of ""motivate"" you to stay disciplined.  
  
What I wished I knew as a beginner in Apr 2024:  
  
Orientation class is a waste of your credit because it basically just presents the platform, DM me and I will send you a summary of what happens there and save your actual learning credit.  
If you like a teacher, you can go to the that teachers board and book their classes, I swear having a class with a teacher I liked made the biggest difference.(My German recommendations: Agnieska, Ozlem, Julia, Branislav, etc).  
\*hint: book from ahead of time and aim to have classes as early in the morning as possible since that s when you have the chances of being just you and the teacher or just 2 people and the teacher = more speaking time, basically a 1o1 class on sale.  
  
3. Prepare for every class with the vocabulary and do the homework or exercises proposed as homework in the previous class.  
  
4. Try to stay as chronological as possible with the classes because the level between Chapter 1-2-3 vs 11-12 is very different and it just smooths your learning curve.  
  
5. You only need to do 45 classes/50 to get the certificate, my advice is to skip first orientation and some of the starting communication classes( even if you skip them you can book the class, download the material and cancel immediately using the 30 min after book free cancellation policy). NEVER skip in GRAMMAR classes because in my opinion are the most important.  
  
As a comparison to Babbel Live, Lingoda offers more, the certificate is recognized and Lingoda has for B1 135 classes offer, while Babbel has only 36, focusing mainly on speaking.  
  
If you are thinking about trying out Lingoda here is my referral link: [https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv](https://referral.lingoda.com/6Dr9Cv)  
  
I dig monthly for discounts because I am a cheap as that can't pay full price so I got most of the months 20-30% discounts on plans for 20-40 classes so the price/class stayed in 7-8 eur range which is cheaper than a class in my home country.  
  
No hidden truth: you get paid for recommending Lingoda, but what I would offer you is a free 30 mins presentation from my account of their possibilities and my honest B1.2 from 0 feedback after many errors I wish I knew better.",1,1734447412.0,referralcodes,0,1.0,False

I've been collecting perfumes for the past 1.5 years, and here’s my collection. I’d love to hear your thoughts!

**Lattafa Asad (100ml)**  
Scent: A peppery, amber, woody, and patchouli-rich opening, with a powdery, vanilla, and labdanum dry down.  
Performance: Lasts 9+ hours on skin and 12+ hours on clothes. Even when I stopped smelling it on myself, others could still detect it.  
Price: ₹1,459 (from Perfume Palace).

**Lattafa Vintage Radio (100ml)**  
Scent: Smells like a South Indian wedding—a unique mix of lavender, plum, and floral notes in the opening, with sweet sandalwood and palo santo in the dry down.  
Performance: 10+ hours on skin and 12+ hours on clothes.  
Price: ₹2,800 (from Perfume Palace).

**Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa (100ml)**  
Scent: Sugary sweet with cinnamon and cardamom at the top, transitioning to vanilla and coffee in the dry down.  
Performance: Exceptional—17+ hours on skin and 24+ hours on clothes. It's so strong that even soap and water couldn’t remove it. Use only 2-3 sprays!  
Price: ₹2,199 (from Perfume Palace).

**Pendora Scents Tobacco Vanille (100ml)**  
Scent: A blast of tobacco spice in the opening, settling into a warm vanilla dry down. It’s ideal for mature audiences (29+ age group).  
Performance: 8+ hours on skin and 10 hours on clothes.  
Price: ₹1,499 (from Perfume Palace).

**Jean Lowe Noir (100ml)**  
Scent: Opens with dark, smoky incense, and dries down to a slightly citrusy and fresh vibe.  
Performance: 5 hours on skin (I’m hoping it improves with maceration).  
Price: ₹2,100 (from Belvish).

**Jean Lowe Immortel (100ml)**  
Scent: Citrus, ginger, and rosemary in the opening, with an ambery, floral dry down. Some reviews compare it to bug spray, but if you know of a bug spray that smells like this, please let me know—I’d buy it!  
Performance: 4-5 hours on skin (needs maceration for better longevity).  
Price: ₹2,200 (from Belvish).

**Rasasi Fattan (100ml)**  
Scent: Citrus and woody in the opening, with a powdery dry down. Unfortunately, I didn’t enjoy this scent.  
Performance: 4 hours on skin.  
Price: ₹1,350 (from Amazon).

**Wild Stone Edge (50ml)**  
Scent: A musky, floral, soapy fragrance that remains consistent through the dry down.  
Performance: 3-4 hours on clothes.  
Price: ₹500 (directly from Wild Stone).

**Wild Stone Code Steel Body Spray (150ml)**  
Scent: Oceanic, fresh, and floral in the opening, with a powdery dry down. Some say it smells like Giorgio Armani’s Acqua di Gio—if that’s true, I’d love to own one.  
Performance: 1.5 hours on clothes.  
Price: ₹300 (from a local store).

**Hasan Ouds Oud Mukhallat (3ml)**  
Scent: Many find it nostalgic, but to me, it smells like a middle-aged Arab man. I also tried their Black Oud, which smells like spicy and sweet meetha paan.  
Performance: 1 hour max.  
Price: ₹849.

**Ajmal Neutron (100ml)**  
Scent: Citrus in the opening, and that’s it—there’s no real dry down.  
Performance: Disappointing—only 30 minutes on skin. This was my first perfume, and after this, I never bought anything from Ajmal again.  
Price: Unknown (but I still keep a little juice left as a reminder not to buy Ajmal).

I’m enjoying this journey of discovering different fragrances. Some of these have great performance and unique scents, while others were disappointing. If you’ve tried any of these or have recommendations, let me know!",16,1734446399.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,12,0.83,False
1hgc15o,https://i.redd.it/1qoi57tl7f7e1.jpeg,Today's reason for getting dressed in a full rick fit is that it's a Tuesday. ,"I often see people say that they need a reason for wearing their rick out. Don't get me wrong, I get it. Especially if you are new to collecting or only have a few pieces. I used to be the same way even back when I only had super tame pieces like some collapse cut denim I got for $70, ramones, and a ripped unstable cotton tee. 

As I got comfortable with wearing those fits, I also got deeper into the brand and started slowly picking up some of the more expiremental runway pieces. Now, I exclusively collect runway or vintage (pre 05) pieces from my favorite seasons. 

If you are self conscience about standing out, you're partially right. About the 'standing out' part that is. To solve the self conscience part, I recommend getting a pair of dark sunglasses which help you feel anonymous as you get used to wearing crazier things out. 

Now I'm in knee deep in Marshall's with kiss heels and feeling great. Not to mention how many amazing conversations get started from strangers. I will never get over the crowd that commonly compliments my kiss heels - almost exclusively 45+ aged people who instantly recognize them as ""the gene Simmons"" shoes. 

It's liberating walking out of the house feeling like I'm able to express myself, engage in my hobbies, and prompt conversation from strangers all while remaining relatively anonymous from the 'shield' of my sunglasses. 

If you are second guessing wearing that new piece out, I highly encourage you to bite the bullet and have some fun. You won't regret it.

May mga nagpm and nagsabi na iupdate ko raw sila so ito na yon haha. Guys, naclutch ko!!! CPA NA KO!!! But as expected na lowest ko ang FAR and malayo sa rankings but at least pasado na.

Maraming salamat sa community na to. Dito nagstart ang aking CPA journey. Naalala ko may [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AccountingPH/s/mO3DL93FLE) pa ko dito last year if kaya ko pa ba makapasa if weak ang foundation ko but look at me now, nasa top 20s ng preboard and ganap ng CPA ngayon. This journey is easier dahil sa mga tao dito na walang sawang nasagot kapag may mga tanong about materials, habits, and other tips. Napakasolid ng community na to, grabe. Mahal na mahal ko kayo guys, lalo na mga naging friends ko here.

SIDE NOTE LANG! Hindi ko inexpect na 30% pa rin ang passing rate ng CPALE. Akala ko dahil matagal ang release and naextend ang exam ay mas tataas na ang ratings. It shows lang gano kahigpit at kahirap makapasa. Kaya sa mga friends and mga nandito na di nakapasa, tandaan nyo palagi na DELAYED BUT NOT DENIED.

And the director of our program dropped the news that she “knew atlas” when I mentioned my love for the games and I was so excited. (As you can imagine) Karl is however an incredibly busy guy so I wasn’t able to get in touch with him until one of my friends (that went through the same apprenticeship with me) worked with him on a project (Karl was his dialect coach) and got his info for me!  

I sent Karl a message sharing a recording of my work (a solo show I invited him to but he was too busy to attend unfortunately) and he praised my work (which still feels unreal) and said he enjoyed it. 

Regarding BioShock he said, 

“And I'm glad you enjoyed Bioshock.  It was certainly great fun to do and I feel really fortunate to have had such a great experience - one that keeps on giving even years later.”

We were supposed to meet for coffee but we’re both busy at the time and haven’t yet.  Overall he was very sweet and didn’t seem to mind that I brought up bioshock at all. ",3,1734446202.0,Bioshock,0,1.0,False

I have also used Union, Origin and Extract coffee at my previous place, but again, all have been disappointing ever since having Volcano.

I want to go with Volcano as I have had them in the past and have had nothing but positives back then.

1hgbuom,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1hgbuom/specialty_food_store/,Specialty Food Store.,"Hello all! I am new to the sub! I reside in beautiful Whiting, Indiana. The urban core of Northwest Indiana, just 16 miles southeast of Chicago , right along Lake Michigan. In recent years this quaint walkable city has grown like crazy. The city has a massive Slovak-Polish population and is known for its insane annual Pierogi Fest (this ties in to the business idea, see below) the city is booming with luxury condos being built, nice stores in the downtown and quality homes as well. With all of this, I assume a Specialty Food Store would suit the needs of curating a more elevates mixed-use scene in town. Mixed-use is always coffee shops, restaurants, etc. not that I don't like these, but truly mixed-use urban areas need anchors to them that can provide residents with all they need on foot or via public transit. Anyways back to the concept: There are more grocery options, but they require a 15-20 minute car drive in any direction. All that there is: a Walmart & Stracks (Northwest Indiana grocer) + 2 small Mexican Grocery Stores. I feel with the growing luxury housing a specialty food store specializing in organic, hormone-free local meats, deli, dairy, seasonal fresh produce, wines, and also a Eastern European section as I believe it would get a lot of business from the large Slovak/Polish local population. I am in the beginning stages, planning to get an empty plot of land. Build out the very small grocery store: roughly 20×68 feet and then two 3 bed/2 bath apartments above + 4 car covered garage off alley. I plan on marketing the units as luxury and they will be luxury quality, private balconies + rooftop with a view of Chicago Skyline & Lake Michigan. My plan is to have the two apartments help offset/cover the costs of the construction loan/mortgage.

Do you think this is an achievable business plan? How much do you estimate it would cost? I roughly ran some numbers. In my area, new construction is roughly $150-250 per sq. ft.
Grocery Store - 20x68 ft = 1,360 sq. ft
3 Bed/2B Apt - 20x68 ft = 1,360 sq. ft
3 Bed/2B Apt - 20x68 ft = 1,360 sq. ft
Total: 4,080 sq. ft = $612,000-1,020.000

I want to first introduce myself as a newbie to the Springs; my wife and I are leaving dusty ass Oklahoma and will be in COS within the next few days. Since we had to leave for safety reasons, I wanted to build a list of places that are safe for queer people so she didn’t feel stuck at home during 🍊 presidency. 

This list was collaborated by skimming countless posts on Reddit and by searching for businesses owned by LGBTQ people. I assumed MOST of what I saw in Manitou Springs was accepting due to their friendliness towards LGBTQ folk. I cannot speak from experience for these places, but I know the local community can help attest to what’s safe and what’s not safe. For context, I am a woman (33) and my wife (36) is a tall masc lesbian. We are both people of color.

Anyhow, here’s the list! I hope it helps people who are traveling or plan to settle in COS. I hope it also helps us along the way as we try to re-root somewhere safer than where we currently are.

1hgbpl3,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIWhistleblowersMITA/comments/1hgbpl3/how_to_be_a_support_group_encourage_a_marriage_to/,"How to be a ""support group"" - encourage a marriage to fail.","Very interesting series of events over there at SGIWhistleblowers. Someone shared a strange story on another Reddit sub, and it got moved to sgiwhistleblowers. The story told is kind of strange in itself. The guy married a woman in Japan, and she and her family, before the wedding, denied having a religion – but it turned out her father was a Soka Gakkai leader who didn’t tell his prospective son0in0law about chanting. Neither did the wife, who managed somehow to chant 2 hours a day for a year without Hubbie finding out.

Be that as it may. Here’s the *most* interesting and telling thing. He describes his wife, after over a year of marriage,  the SGI member, thus: “S*he's perfect, extremely caring, understanding and polite. . . she is extremely understanding and caring, she's the kind of girl that wakes up early and prepares my coffee before I wake up or before I come back home from work without even me asking. She works 9 to 6 and still does house chores, fold my clothes. And plays video games and movies with me that I know she's not interested in. . . She doesn't blame me for some of my hobbies that other girls might be upset about (for example gaming 8 hours straight)*”

Sounds like he thinks she’s awesome, and he says more than once in the post that he doesn’t want to divorce her.

**But the sgiwhistleblowers comments**, and evidently most of the comments on the other sub, tell him to run away from the marriage. Not one “If you love her, fight for her” or “She sounds great, worth putting up with a few foibles” or anything that would actually *support* the couple

See, sgiwhistleblowers claims to be a “support” group, but it is anything *but*.

It’s another case of “Your wife is doing something she loves and feels makes her a better person. Don’t put up with *that*!!”

Then they go on crowing about how their membership increased when people from the other sub found them. While accusing the SGI of being interested only in numbers – which is a bad thing if the SGI does it - they are sure hung up on numbers themselves.

And they can’t seem to conceive of why MITA exists.

(And, by the way, the sgiwhistleblowers Chief Sock Puppeteer is trying even harder to keep anyone from MITA reading what she writes; she can’t *stand* that anyone disagrees with her or points out her falsehoods. Quite brave, if you ask me., showing that she is confident her arguments are sound.) (**NOT**)",1,1734445450.0,SGIWhistleblowersMITA,0,1.0,False

I purchased a 1 cup moka pot about a month ago and it worked great, but it was just too small so I upgraded to a 3 cup. This one I cannot get to work for the life of me.

It sputters the whole time and makes a huge mess and even once it’s “done” there’s still a lot of water left in the lower chamber. Here’s everything I do and maybe you can give me some tips:

- I start by boiling my water in my kettle
- I fill it right under the gasket
- I add my coffee (cafe bustelo - maybe this is too fine?) so it’s a little mound, I don’t tap it down
- screw it together and add it to my stove
- use about medium-ish heat and then turn it down to low. But I’ve been playing around with this and still cannot find the right spot. ",2,1734445449.0,mokapot,5,1.0,False

1hgbngr,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1hgbngr/super_old_on_a_super_sport/,Super old on a super sport ,Well I’ve decided to get back on the horse.  Wondering how much mojo I still have.  Had an on track crash when I was 52 years old.  I’ve been unable and maybe unwilling to ride sport bike for more than a decade.  But I’m  picking up a gsxr tomorrow.    I’m in my mid 60s now got my first bike when I was 9. In the dark ages. I have owned every type of bike you think of.  But there is a huge hole in the soul not having a performance machine.  It’s where my heart is.  I know here in the states it seems uncommon to see geriatric guys on sport bikes but not so much across the pond.  There seems to be many at the IOM TT.   In the U.S. grandpas opt for adventure or cruisers and I’ve owned both. I Sold the lumbering Harley 3 years ago.  Those bikes don’t give me the hyper-focused thrill I need.   This won’t be a designated race bike. But I hope to throw it around on the occasional track day.  At times I kinda feel like a silly boomer chasing glory days. Bottom line is even though I live with chronic pain and health issues I’ve decided can’t stop living!  The wife agrees as long I promise not to do those forever stand-up freeway wheelie’s again.  Just won’t do them when she’s watching 😂. So wish me luck and try not to laugh too hard when I pull off the helmet at the coffee shop.  👊😎👍,24,1734445274.0,motorcycles,23,0.93,False

Κράζεις, θαυμάζεις, θα πω εγώ.

Αν και μένω Άμστερνταμ, 42 ετών Προγραμματιστής με Ι5, θα σας πω τί παρατήρησα στα πρόσφατα ταξίδια μου:

1) Έχω πάει Αφγανιστάν, Καμπούλ για επαγγελματικό ταξίδι. Όχι τίποτα κέντρο, σε ένα προάστιο είχα κλείσει ένα Airbnb. Ρε φίλε όλο το βράδυ κάτι Ταλιμπάν με ΑΚ47 σε οδοφράγματα στις εισόδους της πόλης, να καίνε λάστιχα αυτοκινήτου. Στο πατρικό μου στον Ασπρόπυργο πιο καθαρή είναι η ατμόσφαιρα, δίπλα στις τσιμινιέρες από τα διυλιστήρια. Έχουμε και εμείς κάτι αρχαίους Ρωμαίους Ταλιμπάν, αλλά μόνο πέτρες πετάνε.

2) Πάω μετά Μιανμάρ. Καταρχήν εκτίμησα το πώς οδηγάμε εδώ στην Ελλάδα. Σε κάποια φάση στο δρόμο, περνάει ένα όχημα Unimog με χίλια μέσα στο λασποδρομο, και γαζωνε random περαστικούς με ένα μυδραλιοβολο που είχαν στην καρότσα. Εντάξει λέω, το ξεπερνάω, και πάω να φάω πολιτισμένος φαγητό. Σταματάω σε υπαίθρια καντίνα, μου βγάζουν μισοψημενο παγκολινο μαριναροσμενο σε σάλτσα δαμάσκηνο. Σιχαίνομαι τα δαμάσκηνα. Αμέσως στο μυαλό μου ήρθε ο ""Γιατρός της Πείνας"", εκείνη η φοβερή καντίνα ανάμεσα Εύοσμο και Μενεμένη, όπου ο Ρωμαίος σεφ ψεκαζε το ψωμάκι του σάντουιτς με Ajax (ελληνιστί AZAX)

3) Λέω νταξει ας μη συγκρινόμεθα με τριτοκοσμικές χώρες, πάω εκδρομή στην Νότια Κορέα. Αναπτυγμένα πράγματα εδώ! Σε μια φάση εκεί που κάνω τζοκινγκ στα σύνορα με τη Βόρεια Κορέα, αρχίζουν να μου ρίχνουν προειδοποιητικές βολές και από τη μια πλευρά και από την άλλη! Και να μου φωνάζουν κάτι: *목표로 돌아가 자기야* .  Ρε σαν την Ελλάδα μας δεν έχει, όταν ανεβαίνω Σκόπια για οδοντίατρο, να φουλαρω το αμάξι και να παίξω κουλοχέρη στη Γευγελή, ούτε ταυτότητα δε μου ζητάνε στα σύνορα.     


Ρε πάρτε το χαμπάρι ρε! Σαν την Ελλάδα δεν έχει! Πάλι καλά να λέμε. Δόξα την Παναγία να λέμε!

Σας χαιρετώ, πάω στο coffee shop της γειτονιάς μου, να φάω μπισκότα κάνναβης! ΓΕΙΑ ΣΟΥ ΕΛΛΑΔΑΡΑ ΜΟΥ! 🇫🇮🇫🇮🇫🇮🇺🇾🇺🇾🇺🇾",15,1734445224.0,greececirclejerk,3,0.95,False
