I tried it on in their tiny changing room that smells like mothballs and almost cried. It fits like it was made for me, which is insane because I've been to three bridal shops where nothing looked right and everything cost more than my car payment.

The beading is all intact, no stains, no tears, just waiting for someone to love it again. I took about fifty photos and sent them to my sister who immediately started crying over FaceTime and demanded I buy it immediately.

Now I just need to find someone to marry me, which honestly feels less daunting than finding a wedding dress I could actually afford. I've been looking at handmade veils on the Tedooo app to complete the look (I also have my store there, thank you for the tip), and there are some gorgeous artists on there making custom pieces that won't break my budget.

1m4vp3y,https://i.redd.it/8rw7f0l5k2ef1.jpeg,Cat & Cloud Kercha - natural Ethiopian. Anyone have success?,"Would love some help from anyone who's had success with this bean.

18 days off roast. From other comments I've found online, consensus seems to be that it's closer to medium than light.

I'm using the Coffee Chronicler Hario Switch method, which is my go-to for a new bean since it's so forgiving. That usually gives me a sense of what the bean has to offer before I move on to V60.

196F water

Grinding at 5.0 on Ode Gen 2

TWW at half strength

1:16 ratio as recommended by the roaster (15g:240g)

0:00 Switch open, spiral pour to 120g

0:45 switch closed, spiral pour to 240g and swirl gently

2:00 open switch and drain

Total contact time 2:40

The cup is inoffensive but I would say very flat. The main note I'm getting is a smoky/roasty flavor. Not quite bitter, though perhaps on the edge of bitter. Not astringent. But definitely no fruity notes coming through, and no noticeable acidity. Certainly no ""candy fragrance and berry notes"" as Fellow describes.

The smoky/roasty flavor makes me think it's overextracted, but I don't have much experience with roasts on the darker side like this. I'm wondering if I should dial back the water temp, grind coarser, or reduce agitation.

Interestingly, Fellow has [some brew parameters](https://fellowproducts.com/products/catandcloud-ethiopia-kercha?srsltid=AfmBOoqUvtO-ltMEsrWbby9yyfwmFg7H2A9q7_-6LtjpogA1lL2fuyvO) for this bean which would seem to result in much MORE extraction than I am currently doing:

Grind 4.2-5.2 on Ode 2

Water at 205F

Bloom + 2 pulse pours

1m4vo9r,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1m4vo9r/i_dont_feel_guilty/,I don‚Äôt feel guilty,"So I‚Äôve started my medication journey at the end of last year, and I have been through a BUNCH of different pharmaceuticals which I won‚Äôt go through here. As my psych and I have gotten closer to addressing the problem (it started out as medicating for depression and anxiety but now we‚Äôre addressing ADHD), I‚Äôve been trying out some medicines that have fatigue as a side effect. I‚Äôve lost appetite, and I don‚Äôt find as much pleasure going out and doing things. These days I prefer to have quiet time in my room, and the number is creeping down on the scale. 

But the thing is ‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel guilty. From the outside, I‚Äôm exhibiting all the signs of depression. On the inside, I feel like I‚Äôve gotten a break. A break from the circular thoughts, from the food noise and the constant need to GO GO GO. I‚Äôm luxuriating in the silence. Long days without that annoying voice in my head going SHOULDN‚ÄôT YOU BE DOING SOMETHING?! Watching a show and crafting in my room on a Friday night where I used to go out with whatever friend invited me because I felt anxious about maintaining my relationships, even if they were draining the life force out of me. Taking naps in the middle of the day which I never used to be able to do because my brain was always going at 100mph. 

I do hope the fatigue goes away eventually after I find the right medication for me, but for now I‚Äôm not complaining. I feel like I‚Äôm finally getting the rest I‚Äôve denied myself all these years. I‚Äôm not drinking coffee or alcohol anymore either which compounds the fatigue and asocial behavior. But I just don‚Äôt feel guilty! I feel empowered to do what I want when I want to. 

TLDR; I don‚Äôt mind medication side effects because they‚Äôre helping me take midday naps. ",2,1753034769.0,ADHD,2,1.0,False

After I greet them, that's it I never hear from them again and they seldom greet me even in passing in the neighborhood.

I've made some acquaintances.  I try not to mix work and social life so I haven't really made friends at the places I've worked.

1m4vmj8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4vmj8,Spider-Man Brand New Day ideas,"So I think this movie could actually be the best MCU Spider-Man film to date. We have confirmed the Punisher and we have left off with a Peter who had abandoned being Peter Parker and solely Spider-Man. That is a fresh take already. So, how does all this work?

The answer is simple. We introduce Harry and Gwen at Empire State University and we introduce Black Cat as one of the leads. 
Harry and Gwen is already Peter knows but for the wrong reasons. Due to the last film Peter knows the evilness (in his mind) of the Osborn name and he also knows from Peter 3 what happens when Peter and Gwen fall in love, so he distances himself from them, he‚Äôs just at ESU to get a degree because he has next to nothing else.

He is purely Spider-Man which is why we see Black Cat, she is all about being a vigilante and being and not caring who Spider-Man is, and he loves this! Until, he realises maybe being Peter isn‚Äôt such a bad thing.
He goes to the Coffee Bean with Gwen but Scorpion attacks and Pete (out of costume) subtly stops him. Scorpion thanks to help from Fisk tracks where Peter Parker is and attacks ESU and thus nearly killing Gwen and Harry. This is important this only happened because Peter WASN‚ÄôT Spider-Man, thus reverting back to his old ways for now. Until, a lady in the street recognises his family through his eyes, she asks if he‚Äôs related to someone called Ben Parker, she tells Peter he has his eyes.

As for Punisher, he represents order. Fisk wants vigilantes gone and Punisher wants criminals gone and ironically at some points these things cross over and thus Punisher kills Walter Hardy, the original Black Cat. Frank became the Punisher because someone killed his daughter and now a daughter (Black Cat) wants to kill Frank because he killed her father. A lot to explore there and how Peter sees what he could be if he had all that rage but also he sees the good in Frank and Frank sees someone truly special in Spider-Man.

Post credit scene we meet party girl Micheal Jones, back for summer break and a full party girl who is so afraid at MIT of being scene she creates a persona of an elaborate extrovert when we all know she‚Äôs sarcastic and now optimistic introvert

Hobbies/interests:
Reading, horseback riding, soccer (lifelong Chelsea fan ‚öΩ‚Äîyes, I know‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve suffered), and spending time reflecting or learning something new. I appreciate quiet mornings, long walks, and meaningful conversations. I‚Äôve always dreamed of building a large, loving family rooted in faith and shared values.

Tell us a bit about your Christian journey:
I was raised Muslim, but as I grew older and studied more deeply, I began encountering contradictions I couldn‚Äôt ignore. That led me on a personal search for truth‚Äîand ultimately toward Christianity. I was drawn to the message of grace, redemption, and the person of Christ, especially within the Catholic tradition. I‚Äôm still learning, still growing, and grateful for the journey so far.

I‚Äôve been single for a while now by choice‚Äîtaking time to reflect, observe, and focus on growing in faith and character. I didn‚Äôt want to start anything without knowing who I am or where God is leading me. But now, I feel ready for something genuine.

What sort of person are you looking for?
I‚Äôm hoping to meet a kind, faith-driven Christian woman‚Äîsomeone gentle in spirit, strong in conviction, and serious about building a future rooted in love and Christ. I value loyalty, humility, and shared purpose. I'd love to build a family together and support one another through life‚Äôs seasons.

Age range:
20‚Äì30 (flexible). Shared values and maturity mean more to me than just numbers within reasonable exception.

Would you be willing to do long distance/relocate?
Yes. I‚Äôm open to long distance and willing to relocate for the right person.

Anything else?
One of my long-term goals is to eventually start a small business‚Äîsomething grounded in purpose and community. For now, I‚Äôm laying the foundation and trusting in God‚Äôs timing for the rest.

These tops offer a sleek and modern look while being able to withstand heavy use and various weather conditions. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the best metal table tops available in 2025, helping you make an informed decision for your specific needs.

They are particularly favored by businesses like restaurants and cafes due to their ease of maintenance and resistance to damage.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and longevity of a metal table top depend on several key features. Understanding these features will ensure you select a table top that meets your requirements and provides lasting value.

**Material Grade:** The type of metal used is crucial. Stainless steel is a popular choice for its corrosion resistance and hygienic properties, especially in food service environments. Aluminum offers a lightweight yet durable alternative, ideal for outdoor settings were portability is desired. Other metals like iron or copper provide unique aesthetic qualities but may require more maintenance to prevent rust and oxidation.The grade of stainless steel, for example, can vary significantly. 304 stainless steel is a common standard, providing good corrosion resistance for most applications. 316 stainless steel, which contains molybdenum, offers superior resistance to chloride corrosion, making it suitable for coastal or marine environments. Aluminum alloys are typically graded by a four-digit number, with higher numbers indicating greater strength and corrosion resistance.

**Thickness and gauge:** The thickness of the metal sheet affects the table top's strength and resistance to bending or denting. A thicker gauge typically indicates a more robust table top. For heavy-duty applications or larger table sizes, a thicker gauge is essential to prevent sagging or deformation over time.

The gauge of metal is measured inversely, meaning the lower the gauge number, the thicker the metal. For example, 16-gauge steel is thicker than 18-gauge steel. For dining tables and work surfaces, a gauge between 14 and 18 is generally recommended to provide adequate support and durability.

**Surface Finish:** The surface finish not only influences the aesthetic appeal but also affects the table top's resistance to scratches,stains,and fingerprints.Common finishes include brushed, polished, powder-coated, and textured.Each finish offers different levels of protection and maintenance requirements.

Brushed finishes provide a subtle, matte appearance that helps conceal fingerprints and scratches. Polished finishes offer a high-gloss, reflective surface that is easy to clean but may show fingerprints more readily. Powder-coated finishes provide a durable, protective layer that is available in a wide range of colors and textures.

**Edge Design:** The edge design of a metal table top can significantly impact its safety and comfort. Options include square edges, rounded edges, beveled edges, and bullnose edges. Rounded or beveled edges are often preferred in high-traffic areas or for tables used by children to minimize the risk of injury.

Square edges offer a clean,modern look but can be sharp and uncomfortable to lean on. Rounded edges provide a softer, more pleasant surface for users. Beveled edges create a stylish, angled profile that can add visual interest to the table. Bullnose edges are similar to rounded edges but have a more pronounced curve.

## Core Benefits

Metal table tops offer several advantages compared to other materials like wood, glass, or plastic. These benefits make them a popular choice for both residential and commercial applications.

**Durability and Longevity:** Metal table tops are highly resistant to scratches, dents, and stains, making them ideal for high-use environments. They can withstand heavy loads and are less prone to damage from spills or impacts compared to wood or glass. This durability translates to a longer lifespan and reduced replacement costs over time.As an example, a stainless steel table top in a restaurant can withstand frequent cleaning and exposure to food spills without showing signs of wear and tear. A powder-coated aluminum table top can endure harsh outdoor conditions, including rain, sun, and wind, without rusting or fading.

**Ease of Maintenance:** Metal surfaces are generally easy to clean and maintain, requiring only simple wiping with a damp cloth and mild detergent. Unlike wood, they do not require sealing or polishing. This ease of maintenance saves time and effort, especially in commercial settings where cleanliness is essential.

Stainless steel, in particular, is known for its hygienic properties and resistance to bacteria, making it a preferred choice for food preparation areas. powder-coated surfaces are also easy to clean and resistant to stains, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use.

**Versatile Design Options:** metal table tops can be customized to fit various design styles, from modern and industrial to classic and contemporary. They can be paired with different bases and edge designs to create a unique and personalized look. The availability of various finishes and colors further enhances their versatility.

A brushed stainless steel table top can complement a sleek, minimalist interior, while a copper table top can add warmth and character to a rustic setting. Powder-coated metal table tops can be customized in virtually any color, allowing them to seamlessly integrate with existing d√©cor.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions is essential to ensure a clear understanding of metal table tops and their suitability for specific applications.

**Are metal table tops suitable for outdoor use?**
Yes, certain metals like aluminum and stainless steel are highly suitable for outdoor use due to their corrosion resistance. However, it's crucial to choose a table top with a protective finish, such as powder coating, to further enhance its weather resistance.

**Will a metal table top scratch easily?**
The scratch resistance of a metal table top depends on the type of metal and its surface finish. Stainless steel and powder-coated surfaces are generally more resistant to scratches than polished finishes. using coasters and avoiding abrasive cleaners can help prevent scratches.

**Can I cut directly on a metal table top?**
While metal table tops are durable, cutting directly on them is not recommended as it can damage the surface and dull your knives.Using a cutting board is always advisable to protect the table top and your cutlery.

In the case of our permanent, flavored blends, flavor may be derived from the mentioned food source (i.e., vanilla, cocoa, caramel) in addition to containing other natural extracts. No coffees contains pieces of actual ingredient.

Cool. So I'm anaphylactic to Hazelnut and the allergy is an IgE Mediated reaction to a protein. Proteins are very, very, very small. Microscopic, even. So when we say ""no coffees contains pieces of actual ingredient""- how big are these pieces, exactly? As in no microscopic proteins that can kill me? Or are we saying ""no chunks of nuts in here""- because even a tiny powder can kill me. 

Most people would say ""well, just don't drink the flavored type"", but for me it is not that simple. I love the idea of the convenience of nespresso pods, but I already have to deeply research brands because if a coffee brand has ANY hazelnut flavor in its product line, I have had bad reactions to even the plain stuff- because the plain coffee is made on the same assembly line as the hazelnut one.

Hey there redditors,
 My name's Lindsey, I went for doughnuts this morning after I had a little bit of coffee. 

I don't have plans for today so I'm game to chat for a while 
This post will be up all day and I'm in search of a  friendly chat!

 I'm kind and laid back , easy going so long as energies match.
I'm a introvert with some extroverted tendencies even though it makes me a homebody.

It's been a mid summer for me at best,  been saving money so I can do things.
But it seems like one thing after a another happens.  

I hope your summer is going well or maybe your like me and its nice to talk to somebody that's outside of your day to day grind or whatever your going through.

I'm basically going through a rough patch again in life but I'll bounce back as always 
 I don't  have a preference aside that you  should probably consider time zones and age range.

I'm central standard/ Midwest US ( preferably 25-40)
I'm looking for what I mentioned above. ‚¨ÜÔ∏è

Maybe we just need a friendly chat , who try to understand and listen making connections where you wouldn't think of one to occur.

* I absolutely Love reading and watching Horror movies.. I gravitate towards slashers and psychological thriller. Suspense is just oxygen to me lol.

Fantasy and Roleplaying/ adventure.
I do like reading and I'm trying to get myself to do short stories , nothing specific yet as what I'm wanting to write. I think it's cool to explore your imagination and see what's there to immerse yourself in 

So most nights I'm watching movies,  shows ..  and writing ideas down for stories . 

Books yes . Dogs or cats ?  
Cooking .. hell yes ü§§
Baking, I like it I just can't bake a lot of stuff 

I don't play much games nowadays.  Although I do love Fallout, Minecraft, terraria, Stardew valley.  Star wars, Forza, left for dead, call of duty zombies. There's more but that's just a small list off the top of my head.

Tv Shows are crime , suspense and horror
Although I find myself watching a lot of impractical jokers and everybody hates Chris.

So yeah I'm looking for a potential friend or two, most people are just looking for a quick connection. Meanwhile there's some of us looking are for meaningful things and connections. 

 Feel free to message me if anything I mentioned sounds  inviting.

I'm not doing much for a few days so I'm game to spark up a friendship & chat.

PS thanks for reading  if you did take the time that's nice anyways! So I do hope you enjoy your Sunday and have a great start to the new week.",0,1753034084.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

Hey there,

I‚Äôm a 33-year-old guy from Southeast Michigan (Thumb area), and I‚Äôm looking to meet a woman who‚Äôs down for an easygoing, fun, and real connection‚Äîno pressure, no drama, just good energy and honest vibes.

A little about me:
By day, I‚Äôm living the hybrid work life‚Äîflexible schedule, weird hours, and plenty of time to sneak away for a coffee, a hike, or an impromptu road trip. Weeknights, I‚Äôm all about keeping it low-key: trash TV, sports, a good book, or zoning out with a drink after a long day.


But weekends? That‚Äôs when I thrive. I‚Äôm big on anything outdoors‚Äîcamping, kayaking, beachcombing, breweries, hiking, biking, getting lost somewhere scenic. I like being active, but I‚Äôm not out here trying to climb Everest. It‚Äôs more about soaking up the good weather and good company.

Vibes & personality:
Think laid-back with a sarcastic edge. I‚Äôm the kind of guy who can have you cracking up one minute and getting deep the next. I‚Äôm loyal, touchy-feely (in a good way), and I genuinely enjoy getting to know people. My love language is physical touch and witty banter‚Äîso if you like to tease, flirt, and dish it right back, we‚Äôll get along just fine.

Physically:
5'10"", green eyes, brown hair, athletic build. No smoking, no drugs, social drinker, and disease-free. I keep myself in good shape and appreciate someone who takes care of themselves, but perfection isn‚Äôt the goal‚Äîauthenticity is.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
A woman who‚Äôs confident, kind, and doesn‚Äôt take life (or herself) too seriously. Curvy? Outdoorsy? A little sarcastic or delightfully weird? Total win. I‚Äôm not looking to collect chats or ghost people‚ÄîI‚Äôd rather have one or two solid, ongoing connections with someone who‚Äôs down for both fun and depth. We can start flirty and playful and just see where things go.

This isn‚Äôt a mass casting call‚Äîjust one real connection that feels good, whether it‚Äôs daily texts, venting after work, sharing memes, or planning to meet up.

If you made it this far, shoot me a message that tells me a little more than ‚Äúhey.‚Äù What‚Äôs your perfect lazy Sunday? What show do you secretly binge when no one‚Äôs watching? Or just throw a sarcastic one-liner at me‚ÄîI‚Äôll throw one back.

Let‚Äôs keep it light, honest, and fun‚Äîand if something more grows from it, even better.

**Context:** *Lived together. She was a stepmother to my child. We were actively chasing dreams together. Then over a year ago, discarded, monkey-branched, hoovered, stone-walled ‚Äî all the things. I loved her very much.* 

**In that time, I've followed through with little acts of letting go:**  

* **Going to therapy** and getting proper help for my ADHD diagnosis 
* Put all my time and energy into **my health**, **my son** and **my business** 
* It took 11 months for her to **get all of her stuff out** and only because I pushed on it 
* **Really struggled committing to NC and not stalking social medias** but through continuous effort got to the point where I'm fully committed and just living my life now 
* **Struggled with my physical health** as my blood pressure has been very high and I have developed a heart condition but it looks like we're making strides in the right direction on that 
* **Reached major milestones** in my career with some insanely cool things on the horizon that I never thought possible 
* **Started dating again** and realized all the reasons she loved me haven't changed and others see those things too 
* **Rebuilt my self-confidence** and have found **security in my solitude**. I'm actually surprised at the amount of romantic interest I have received but I'm being really healthy and slow in my interactions, paying closer attention to actions over words. 
* Most of my conversations revolve around **the Present**. I don't want to trauma bond and I don't want to get caught in future-faking. Just taking things one day at a time and focusing on the now has made things incredible clear and simplified. 

I feel like there's **one final act of letting go** that I have yet to commit to and I know deep down it's something I have to do. 

**I have a small wooden box with keepsakes from our relationship that meant a lot to me:** *Christmas ornament I got her, a Dr. Who card with loving words she wrote me, pictures of us with my son, etc* ‚Äî and I know that I can't keep holding onto these things. 

>Some have told me to just chuck it in the garbage. Others have said to make a ritual out of burning them on the beach in a coffee can or something like that. I don't know why I'm struggling to let these things go. Some say it's me still holding onto hope though I know the reality of our situation is hopeless. Others have said it's fear of moving forward. I'm not sure the answer here.   
  
I can't see a case for keeping the box. Future relationships would probably find that weird and being sentimental about a toxic relationship is most likely not a good choice. But despite it all ‚Äî I loved her, still have love for her, my son loves her and she was a big part of our lives. It's hard for me to let this final piece go. 

**Any advice or perspective on this one? Any relatable experience of doing physical acts of letting go to help you move forward?**   
  
My ADHD-brain loops a lot so without proper closure it's been difficult giving it to myself but I can see I've made a lot of progress.

## Key Features Analysis

the quality and aesthetics of a mother of pearl coffee table hinge on several key features. these encompass the materials used, the complexity of the inlay work, the structural integrity of the table, and its overall finish. Each of these elements plays a crucial role in determining the table's value, durability, and visual appeal.

**Material Quality of Mother of Pearl:** The quality of the mother of pearl itself significantly impacts the table's brilliance and longevity. Higher-grade mother of pearl will exhibit a consistent, vibrant iridescence and be free from cracks or imperfections. Different types of shell, such as abalone, white pearl, or black lip pearl, offer varying shades and textures, allowing for diverse design possibilities. The thickness and cut of the individual pieces also contribute to the overall visual impact.

**Inlay Work Complexity and Detail:** Intricate and detailed inlay work distinguishes a truly exceptional mother of pearl coffee table.Skilled artisans carefully arrange and adhere the mother of pearl pieces to create elaborate patterns, geometric designs, floral motifs, or even custom artwork. The precision of the inlay work, the tightness of the seams, and the overall artistry determine the table's aesthetic value. Tables with more complex and detailed inlays generally command a higher price due to the labor-intensive nature of their creation.

**Base Construction and Stability:** The table's base construction is crucial for stability and durability. Common materials include solid wood, metal, or a combination of both. A sturdy base constructed from high-quality materials ensures that the table can withstand daily use and supports the weight of the tabletop without wobbling or shifting. The design of the base also contributes to the overall aesthetic, complementing the mother of pearl inlay with its shape, finish, and materials.

**Finish and Coating:** The finish and coating applied to the table protect the mother of pearl inlay and the base from damage. A high-quality finish enhances the natural beauty of the materials and provides a smooth, durable surface that is resistant to scratches, stains, and fading. Common finish options include lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane, each offering different levels of protection and sheen. The appropriate finish should be chosen based on the intended use and the desired aesthetic.**Table Dimensions and Shape:** The dimensions and shape of the coffee table are vital considerations, as they determine how well the table fits into the intended space and how it functions in the room. Coffee tables are available in a variety of shapes,including rectangular,square,round,oval,and freeform. The appropriate shape and size will depend on the size and layout of the room, and also the intended use of the table.

**Ethical Sourcing and Sustainability:** In 2025, ethical sourcing and sustainability are paramount. Consumers are increasingly concerned about the environmental and social impact of their purchases. Mother of pearl should be sourced from sustainable fisheries that practice responsible harvesting methods to minimize damage to marine ecosystems. Additionally, the use of eco-friendly materials and production processes contributes to the overall sustainability of the table.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When considering a home that also serves as a workplace, the 40x60 barndominium kits with shop offer an innovative solution. These versatile buildings combine living space with workspace, making them ideal for those who desire a seamless integration of their personal and professional lives. The design encourages a lifestyle that is both functional and convenient, catering to modern work-from-home needs.

One of the standout features of these barndominium kits is their customizable floor plans. You can design the layout according to your lifestyle. Whether you need a spacious workshop, a separate office, or an expansive living area, these kits offer flexibility. Here are some popular elements you can incorporate into your floor plan:

- **Open Concept Living Space:** This creates an inviting atmosphere and encourages family interaction.
- **Dedicated Office Area:** A quiet workspace can increase productivity while still being at home.
- **Multi-Purpose Workshop:** The shop space can be used for hobbies, crafts, or even small business operations.
- **Storage Solutions:** Built-in cabinets and shelves help to keep the living area clutter-free.

Energy efficiency is another significant advantage of 40x60 barndominium kits. These structures can be built with insulation that reduces energy costs, heating, and cooling needs. Sustainable building materials are often incorporated, making these homes environmentally friendly. By investing in energy-efficient solutions, you not only save money but also contribute to a healthier planet.

Additionally, the aesthetic appeal of barndominiums is hard to overlook. With their rustic charm combined with modern elements, you can create a personalized exterior that reflects your taste. You can choose from various finishes, colors, and styles for both the exterior and the interior. This adaptability allows you to design a space that feels uniquely yours.

The durability of the materials used in these kits is also noteworthy. Steel frames and metal siding enhance the structural integrity, ensuring that the building withstands harsh weather conditions. This longevity means less maintenance and fewer repairs, a significant bonus for busy individuals managing both home and work responsibilities.

For those who love outdoor spaces, adding a porch or deck can fulfill your desire for relaxation spots. You can enjoy fresh air during breaks and have a comfortable place to unwind after a long day. Whether you prefer morning coffee or evening barbecues, these outdoor extensions enhance your living experience.

Security features should not be overlooked when designing your barndominium. Many kits come with options for security systems, robust locking mechanisms, and well-designed entry points that ensure your safety. Such measures are crucial, especially in a live-work arrangement where personal and business assets are often in close proximity.

Moreover, the potential for scalability makes investing in a 40x60 barndominium kit a smart decision. As your business grows, you can adapt the workspace according to your needs. This flexibility means the barndominium can evolve with you, ensuring it remains a practical choice for years to come.

Landscaping can further complement the design, adding yet another layer of functionality and beauty. A well-planned garden or outdoor area can serve as a retreat and foster creativity. Utilizing native plants can also reduce maintenance while promoting biodiversity in your surroundings.

Embracing technology in your 40x60 barndominium kits can enhance your live-work setup. Smart home technologies allow you to control lighting, security, and temperature, giving you convenience at your fingertips. Features such as high-speed internet access make remote work efficient and enjoyable.

40x60 barndominium kits with shop are a revolutionary approach to living and working. Their flexibility, energy efficiency, aesthetic appeal, and durable materials make them a popular choice for those looking to blend their professional endeavors with personal comfort. By choosing these kits, you create a space that meets your current needs and adapts to future aspirations.

Benefits of Choosing a Barndominium for Your Home and Business Needs
--------------------------------------------------------------------

When considering both home and business needs, a barndominium presents a versatile and appealing solution. Combining the rustic charm of a barn with modern comforts, these structures are increasingly popular for couples, families, and entrepreneurs alike. Here are some notable advantages of choosing a barndominium for your living and workspaces.

### Cost-Effective Construction

One of the most significant benefits of barndominiums is their cost-effectiveness. Constructing a traditional home can be an expensive endeavor, but barndominium kits often come at a fraction of the price while still offering ample space and durability. With less complex layouts and fewer materials required, you can save on both labor and material costs.

### Versatile Floor Plans

Barndominiums offer exceptional flexibility in floor plans. You can create living spaces that cater specifically to your lifestyle and business needs. Some typical features include:

- Open floor concepts that allow for easy movement and customization.

I (24M) recently matched with this girl (25F) on the app about 3 weeks ago. We got off the app pretty quickly and set up a date a little more than a week after we matched. We've been texted pretty frequently everyday and asking each other lots of questions. We've found that we both have really similar values and are in similar places in terms of dating. We both want to be more methodical about dating, and are looking for something long term.

For our first date we met for coffee and stopped at a bookstore. We really clicked in person, which I was a little worried about beforehand, and the date lasted over 7 hours. The conversation was good, our sense of humors' matched well. We ended with a quick hug and set up a date for the following week. We texted in a similar frequency and manner as the first week, a lot of kinda surface level questions, but started dipping into deeper topics.

We met for our second date yesterday and I thought it went well. We spent another entire day together at a farmers market and ended the night at an orchestra concert. The conversation had a few more lulls than the first time, but they didn't feel uncomfortable, and is maybe just a product of spending 10 hours together in a single day. Our conversation was more personal and we briefly talked about our dating history. We briefly held hands during the concert. I walked her to her car and we ended the night with a side hug before saying goodbye. I texted her after and said I enjoyed it and I'd like to see her again because I was enjoying spending time with her. She reciprocated and said she was busy next weekend but is open 2 weeks from now. Today our texting conversation has resumed to its baseline

Conceptually I understand that both of us are busy/work long hours and that it's just not possible to meet every week. We've only been on two dates but the conversations we've had while texting have covered a lot more than two dates of information. And I feel like 2 weeks of this continued texting pattern is just gonna cause this to fizzle out in one way or another. I don't know if I'm overthinking this. This is my first time dating out of school and I don't know if my expectations of how much you see a person while working are warped or something. But I'd like to see her more, I feel like we do have this background about each other, and I want more of that connection that you can only get in person. Is this something I bring up with her? I feel like it's far too early to ask what she thinks about our relationship.

Any advice is welcome!

TLDR: Been on two dates with a girl over 3 weeks. We've texted a lot, everything feels like it has been going well, but I want more face to face connection.",1,1753032986.0,hingeapp,2,1.0,False

Basically I‚Äôm a woman in my early 20s and there‚Äôs a shop and a bus stop about two blocks away from my house which is where I go every day to make my commute. There‚Äôs a homeless woman that sits there regularly, and I‚Äôve now had two pretty negative interactions with her and am a little concerned on what to do‚Äî I‚Äôm in the habit of saying hello to people begging on the street and kinda ‚Äúnot today, sorry‚Äù most of the time as I don‚Äôt carry cash, and when I did this with this woman, she pressed me on it and kept asking why and trying to change my mind/explain her circumstances and when I walked away she followed me down the street to keep talking to me. Just now I saw her again and she brought up our last conversation (I had explained I couldn‚Äôt take money out for her the last time) and again started this back and forth. I didn‚Äôt want her to follow me again so I kept trying to just apologise and give soft nos, saying I could grab her something to eat if she‚Äôd like, and she kept pressing me on getting cash and ultimately multiple people stepped in including another homeless man to tell her off and to tell me to just keep walking. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do going forward. I feel a bit stupid for having begun this exchange at all, especially at a place that I now must walk by every day, made worse because she knows me and knows I live nearby. I want to be kind to people who are down on their luck and I‚Äôve previously bought food/cigarettes/coffee for people after talking to them and them making a reasonable request, but I am second guessing this as I am realizing it can unfortunately be a risk to do so. This woman is definitely mentally unwell and addicted to something and I am afraid (and pretty positive) she will confront me again, I think she only didn‚Äôt follow me this time because she got into it with the man who was telling her off for harassing me. Should I just plan to take a more inconvenient route to circumvent her/go to a different shop? It‚Äôs illegal to carry pepper spray or any self defense item here which is too bad as I think this would make me feel more confident, even if I never actually used it. I just would love any words of wisdom on my experience and how I should go forward.

I work full time, four days in the office, one from home. My wife stays home with our 1-year-old daughter. That was her choice ‚Äî I‚Äôd prefer she worked, but childcare‚Äôs stupid expensive and we wouldn‚Äôt get any subsidies, so we agreed her staying home made the most sense.

When our daughter was a newborn, I did everything I could ‚Äî helped with breastfeeding, did the early mornings, whatever needed doing. Eventually we moved to mixed feeding, and when she was only waking once a night, my wife would do the night wake, and I‚Äôd take mornings. Seemed fair.

Well, our daughter started sleeping through the night around 6 or 7 months. She barely wakes at all now. But the mornings? Still all me. Every single one. Weekdays, weekends, doesn‚Äôt matter. I‚Äôm up with her around 6, usually until 8:30 when I leave for work. If I work from home or it‚Äôs the weekend, my wife stays in bed until 9 or 10. Occasionally she‚Äôll do a morning, but only if I absolutely have to be somewhere. Otherwise, it‚Äôs ‚ÄúShe wants you.‚Äù Every time.

No offer. No taking turns. No ‚ÄúHey, you‚Äôve done 13 mornings in a row, I‚Äôve got this one.‚Äù Just: ‚ÄúShe wants you.‚Äù

I‚Äôm tired.

Last week I worked from home and things were quiet. My wife took a nap in the middle of the day. I fed our daughter, got her down for a nap, then got some work done. My wife wakes up mid-afternoon, looks around, and immediately starts complaining about the mess. No thanks, no ‚Äúyou‚Äôve had a full day of work and parenting,‚Äù just: why do I have to clean? Honestly? I realised I was more relaxed when she was asleep. That sucked to realise.

Then Friday night we had some friends over. Just a few drinks after our daughter went down. I don‚Äôt drink anymore ‚Äî had a bad relationship with it and don‚Äôt want it around my kid. My wife still drinks, no issue there. We wrapped up around 1am.

Daughter wakes at 7. I get up, again. My wife sleeps till 10. I‚Äôve already done breakfast, a nap, coffee run, lunch, the usual. She wakes up hungover. Our daughter goes down again for her afternoon nap‚Ä¶ and so does my wife. I clean up from the night before, do chores, prep dinner. She gets up at 5pm when the baby wakes. I cook dinner. I clean. I do bedtime.

That night, our daughter wakes up (maybe a nightmare). I go in, try for over an hour. My wife takes a turn for half an hour, thinks she‚Äôs sorted it, goes back to bed watching reels. Baby wakes again. I go back in, rock her in the pram, fall asleep on the floor. Crawl back into bed at 3am.

She wakes at 7am. ‚ÄúShe wants you.‚Äù Of course.

At 9 I say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm getting you a coffee and then I‚Äôm having a nap before the work week starts.‚Äù Wife agrees. I get back, lie down, maybe get 30 minutes before she comes in, blow drying her hair and asking how I‚Äôm doing. Then sits there scrolling reels. I say, ‚ÄúPlease just blow dry your hair, I‚Äôm trying to sleep.‚Äù Twenty minutes later she goes, ‚ÄúGet up, have a shower, you‚Äôll feel better when Tilly wakes up and we can go get food.‚Äù

It's not just about posting photos and waiting‚Äîsuccessful private sales require genuine conversation and connection with potential buyers.

**Understanding Your Buyers**

Different buyers have different priorities. Some want the best deal, others prioritize reliability, and some are buying their teenager's first car. Pay attention to their approach: quick messages with basic questions vs. detailed inquiries about maintenance records can tell you what matters most to them. Ask about their intended use for the vehicle‚Äîdaily commuting, weekend trips, or backup transportation. This helps you address their specific concerns rather than giving generic responses.

**Honesty Builds Trust**

Being upfront about your car's condition actually helps rather than hurts your chances. Mention that coffee stain on the seat, the parking lot dent, or the recently replaced battery. Buyers appreciate transparency and are less likely to walk away over surprises during inspection. When someone asks about accidents or repairs, give a straightforward answer. This approach saves time by filtering out buyers whose expectations don't match your car's reality while building confidence with serious prospects.

**Leverage Platform Tools**

Modern private car sales websites offer messaging systems that keep all communication organized in one place. Use these built-in tools rather than juggling emails and phone calls. Turn on notifications for quick responses, which shows you're serious about selling. Many platforms also offer secure payment processing and documentation assistance, making the entire transaction smoother and safer for both parties.

**Professional Communication Practices**

Quick response times demonstrate reliability, even if it's just a message saying you'll provide details later. Use clear, simple language instead of car jargon. Stay patient with buyers who need more information‚Äîsome people research thoroughly before making decisions. Keep negotiations respectful, as a friendly rejection often leads to counteroffers or referrals.

1m4upse,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1m4upse/csv101_columbus/,CSV-101 Columbus,"Entry 1
Hello, I'm Dr. Erikson. I'm aboard the CSV-101 Columbus. If anyone ever reads this, here's my story.

I was born in 3010, in Norway ‚Äî that's right, I'm pushing 40 now. I got my PhD at Arrington, and that's probably the main reason I was chosen for this program. We're tasked with finding a new planet where humanity can survive.

After World War III, a lot of problems snowballed us into this situation. The only good thing that came out of the war was the leap in technology. I wasn't alive to see it, but I heard stories from my grandfather.

The point is: we can't afford to fail this mission.

There are about 30 people on the ship with me, most of them here to assist with research and scouting the planets we might land on. Aaron Gladwin is the captain of the ship. He knows a bit of everything, but he‚Äôs more of a militaristic type. I believe he's well-versed in engineering, but I'm not familiar with him yet.

My assistant, Jamie Wong, seems hopeful ‚Äî she's one of those optimistic types. It's a good change, I think. Sometimes I wish I could believe in our success as much as she does.

Entry 2
We made it to our first planet after a month.

Dr. Wong has become somewhat of a friend. At least I have someone to share my thoughts with. But I should get straight to the point:

We found life.

It looks like some kind of plant ‚Äî but its color is strange. It‚Äôs a pale beige tone, almost like aged parchment. But what unsettled me most is its texture‚Ä¶ it looks flesh-like.

When the exploration team returned ‚Äî an hour later ‚Äî they looked‚Ä¶ older. Not just tired. Aged.

I feared something like this might happen‚Ä¶

We still need to study this ‚Äúplant‚Äù and see what we can learn from it. For now, that‚Äôs all I can say.

Entry 3
I examined the crew that came back. Patel seems to be the least affected. I swear he was in his twenties... now he looks about my age. Gray hair at the sides, crow‚Äôs feet around his eyes, a receding hairline, muscle loss ‚Äî and some memory slippage.

The worst, by far, is Alvarez. He was in his thirties. Now he looks like my grandfather. Maybe he stayed longer than the others? He‚Äôs shorter, his hair is wispy and white, his eyes dull and gray. He has significant memory gaps ‚Äî he knows where he is and what his job is, but he can‚Äôt remember his own birthday. He can‚Äôt remember his daughter. He‚Äôs just an old man now.

The other three are affected to a lesser extent, but the changes are definitely visible.

Extra:
Last night, I heard a tune. A soft humming in the corridor ‚Äî almost mechanical at first. Repetitive and slightly off-tempo, like a lullaby someone half-remembers. It was... unnerving. I should look into it. I can‚Äôt just wait for the worst. If I find something, I‚Äôll write it here. If I can.

Captain Gladwin was stern but reasonable at first. Now he‚Äôs become paranoid. He caught me writing in this personal log and asked why I was doing it. I said it was for ‚Äúresearch,‚Äù but he just walked off. I could still feel his eyes on me long after he left ‚Äî that heavy stare. There‚Äôs more to all this. I just hope I‚Äôm not changing too.

Entry 4
Even though Gladwin refused to let us examine the plant, we eventually convinced him. He said we were all ‚Äúchanging.‚Äù He even got physical with one of my team members ‚Äî he‚Äôs cooling off in his chambers now.

I remember how my brother used to get in fights... until he couldn‚Äôt anymore. His recklessness caught up with him. He‚Äôs the lucky one. Times are grim. I thought getting away from everything would help me forget ‚Äî or at least take the weight off my back ‚Äî but I only feel heavier. Like I might sink.

We took samples from the plant, then dissected it.

I can‚Äôt describe what we found with full accuracy, but I‚Äôll try my best.

Its skin was pale beige ‚Äî flesh-like, slightly translucent under bright light.
Veins pulsed faintly with a dull amber fluid, viscous like tree sap ‚Äî but warm.
The surface was textured like plucked skin, or stretched parchment.

Beneath the outer layer, there was no plant fiber. Instead, we found a wet mesh of tubular cartilage ‚Äî almost skeletal in structure, but not quite human.

The internal ""organs"" were soft, glistening, and colorless. One of them inflated and deflated like a lung, even after separation.
Another section held brittle plates, arranged like ribs ‚Äî but not in a chest cavity. They encased a jelly-like sac filled with floating, shifting fragments that looked like teeth. Human teeth ‚Äî but wrong.
Too many roots. No enamel.

It feels more like an animal than a plant. I can‚Äôt explain why, but something in my mind insists it‚Äôs sentient. I've never seen anything like it. Our only hope to understand is through the samples, now under testing.

I tried to cool off. Tried to rationalize what I saw. There must be a reason for the plant to have that kind of structure.
But when you imagine aliens... a flesh-plant isn‚Äôt what comes to mind.

Later, I heard the tune again.
Wong was humming it ‚Äî the exact same melody I heard in the corridor. Eyes locked to her microscope. She didn‚Äôt even realize she was doing it.

When I asked what it was, she paused ‚Äî confused ‚Äî and said:

""I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve had it stuck in my head since yesterday. I thought you were the one humming it.""

Like some sick joke, Gladwin began forcing everyone to wear earplugs. He now wears his all the time.
Should I do the same? I was skeptical at first. Now... I‚Äôm not so sure.
Should I report my findings? I fear it‚Äôll make Gladwin worse.
But maybe I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs wrong.

Entry 4.5
The DNA test came back.

The results are‚Ä¶ impossible.

The sample‚Äôs cellular structure includes eukaryotic cells with human-like organelles ‚Äî mitochondria, nuclei... even faint signs of neural signaling.

I read the computer‚Äôs summary report. Just one line:

""Genetic match: 92.3% ‚Äî Homo sapiens sapiens.""  

Entry 5
The DNA analysis changed everything. Even Daniels, our religious officer, couldn‚Äôt cope. He kept repeating verses from the Bible, whispering that the plant was ‚ÄúAdam‚Äôs other rib.‚Äù
It‚Äôs been a week now, and I haven‚Äôt seen him since.

But what really keeps me awake is the 7.7% of the genome that remains undetectable. I‚Äôve never encountered anything like it.
I‚Äôve labeled it MN-0 ‚Äî the unknown genome.
Whatever it is, it‚Äôs the root cause of this‚Ä¶ thing. This ""plant.""

I debated with Dr. Wong, who proposed that it might be the mutated remains of an astronaut ‚Äî a long-lost body warped by cosmic exposure. But that doesn't make sense. There haven‚Äôt been any deep-space expeditions for decades, possibly centuries.
I want to dismiss her theory. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt know what to believe anymore.

Earlier today, I confronted Gladwin. He‚Äôs been a ticking bomb since we brought that thing onboard.
The following conversation is my best recollection:

E: Why do you keep avoiding the lab? And the holding bay?
G: I‚Äôve seen where it leads.
E: What? I need your help here. No one seems to be in their right mind anymore. If we don‚Äôt bring stability back to this ship, all of this effort will be for nothing.
G: You don‚Äôt understand. You got exposed. You changed.
E: It‚Äôs dead. Whatever that thing was ‚Äî whatever way it had to reach us ‚Äî it‚Äôs gone now.
G: All those roots‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll grow through us again.
E: Snap out of it. It‚Äôs gone. For good. Please ‚Äî just level with me here.
G: Maybe you‚Äôll forget. For a while.
E: This isn‚Äôt leading me anywhere. We are lost. The captain is broken ‚Äî and soon, the ship will be too.
G: Stay away from Wong‚Ä¶

I escalated the situation. I punched him.

I‚Äôd never hit anyone before. I‚Äôve always been non-confrontational ‚Äî the kind of person who needed protection.
If I hadn‚Äôt been so weak back then, maybe I could‚Äôve saved M.

But in that moment, I felt pushed.
Gladwin was the only one in direct communication with Command. If he went down completely, we‚Äôd be severed from Earth.
What was I supposed to do?

In the end, he beat the crap out of me. I‚Äôm okay ‚Äî nothing broken. Just a bruised cheek, a bleeding lip, and a pathetic sense of failure.
I fought a delirious man and lost.

Wong helped patch me up. She didn‚Äôt ask what happened. She just hummed while disinfecting the wound.

I was going through the security footage, trying to see if Daniels had ever come out of his chamber.
Nothing from Daniels.

But I found something worse.

I found footage of Wong working late in the lab. In the recording, she never moved her lips ‚Äî not even once.
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ deeply concerning, because the audio captured the same humming.
The same goddamn hum.

We killed that thing. We dissected it. Its parts are still sealed away for future studies. I was sure it was gone.

I know what I have to do next, but it pains me:
I have to put Dr. Wong into lockdown ‚Äî away from the others ‚Äî and study her.

Entry 6

It‚Äôs funny ‚Äî I never wrote about my relationship with Dr. Wong. With Jamie‚Ä¶

She was the first person to reach out and talk to me.
Most of the crew members who worked under me felt ""intimidated."" I don‚Äôt look like a friendly person.
But Jamie never shied away from people, I guess.

It‚Äôs an odd feeling ‚Äî treating someone like an experiment. Like a hostile creature.
I know she‚Äôs scared of planes, even though we‚Äôre in space, on a massive ship.
I know she used to be a horse girl.
I know how she takes her coffee ‚Äî with salt. Says it ‚Äúenhances the flavor.‚Äù

This is the worst time to be thinking about her like this, but I feel guilty.
I know I didn‚Äôt cause this ‚Äî not directly ‚Äî but I feel‚Ä¶ wrong.
Still, I have to keep going.

Today we entered Daniels‚Äô chamber. He‚Äôd hanged himself ‚Äî the first crew member to perish.
We had to dispose of the body. It‚Äôs a horrible thing.
I‚Äôve always felt that a person‚Äôs body is their final farewell ‚Äî the last gift for their family, something to bury with what honor they have left.
But protocol is protocol.
If I end up dead, my body will meet the same fate.

We kept his notes.
I‚Äôm not religious, and I‚Äôm not familiar with theology, but I‚Äôll do what I can to try and understand.
It feels pointless ‚Äî or outright stupid ‚Äî to search through the last words of a desperate man.
It‚Äôs unlikely I‚Äôll find anything.

The only good news is that Gladwin seems better.
He remembers fragments of what happened during these past few days ‚Äî or months.
I feel like time is warping around me.

I‚Äôm not certain, but I suspect Wong caused Gladwin to become delirious.
Now she‚Äôs sealed away in a soundproof observation room.
We can see her through the one-way mirror, but she can‚Äôt see us.
That‚Äôs probably for the best.

She seems sane. For now.

We‚Äôre approaching our next destination ‚Äî a planet and its moons.
This time, we‚Äôll scout the surface.
Maybe we‚Äôll find something useful.
Or maybe we‚Äôll just find more roots.

I struggle to get good cups out of washed Colombian beans. I've had several now, from both DAK and Rogue Wave, but every one gives me a fairly empty cup throughout the bag.

I try to keep my brew method the same - coffee chroniclers hybrid switch recipie (45s open switch, then pour remaining on closed switch to drain at 2mins). Usually with almost any bean, I can play with the temp and grind size combinations (I use a ZP6, anywhere between 3.5 and 6, depending on the bean) and dial it in pretty good within 3-4 tries. Not washed columbines though - I can never seem to get any significant flavours out of them. The most I've been able to do is over extract and get a super bitter cup by grinding super fine, but it doesn't taste good.

Any advice, or are these beans just not for me?",2,1753032389.0,pourover,6,0.75,False
1m4unzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m4unzh/aita_for_refusing_to_participate_in_my_roommates/,"AITA for refusing to participate in my roommate's sudden ""points system"" and calling her out on treating me like a child?","My roommate and I have been living together for two years now, and we've always had a great dynamic. We're both juniors, we split everything fairly, and we've never had any major issues. We naturally fell into routines, she's better at keeping the kitchen clean, I handle most of the bathroom maintenance, we both do our own laundry, and we share common area responsibilities pretty evenly.



Then in January, something weird started happening. She created this point system out of nowhere. Suddenly I was earning ""points"" for taking out the trash, bonus points for vacuuming the living room, and she started keeping track of everything on a whiteboard. At first, I thought it was kind of cute because she'd gotten really into productivity apps over winter break. The ""rewards"" were things like picking what we'd watch for movie night, getting first dibs on the shower schedule, or her buying my coffee when we studied together.



But then it escalated. She started docking points if I left dishes in the sink overnight or if I forgot to wipe down the bathroom counter. Last month, she told me I'd ""lost privileges"" to have friends over because my point total was too low. When I wanted to use her Netflix account (which we've always shared), she said I needed to ""earn it back"" by deep cleaning the refrigerator.



Yesterday I just finished a brutal midterm week and crashed on the couch. She came over with her stupid chart and said something like: Great job on completing your tasks this week! You've earned TV privileges and I picked up those cookies you like as a reward.



Thats when I said to her something like: ""I don't know what productivity influencer you've been following, but this is insane. I'm not your pet that you're training with treats and punishments. We're roommates, not participants in some behavioral experiment. 



She said the system helps her feel like we're both contributing equally and that it ""motivates positive behaviors."" I told her that if she had issues with how I was handling things, she should have just talked to me like an adult.



She started crying and said I was being mean and that she was just trying to make our living situation better. 



I get that some people like gamification, but we didn't have problems before. Our arrangement worked fine for two years. Now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells, waiting to see if I'll ""earn"" basic roommate courtesies that used to just happen naturally.

1m4unxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsGoTravelers/comments/1m4unxy/is_oxford_nice_to_walk_around/,Is Oxford nice to walk around?,"Last weekend, I finally took that day trip from London I'd been putting off forever, and I have to say - walking around Oxford was absolutely worth it. The city has this incredible mix of ancient architecture and modern energy that you just can't find anywhere else.

I started my journey through a guided tour (booked here: https://athometouch.com/London) which turned out to be the best decision. Our guide knew every hidden corner and story behind Oxford's iconic buildings. Walking through the cobblestone streets felt like stepping back in time, but with coffee shops and bookstores adding a contemporary twist.

The Radcliffe Camera was my favorite spot - this circular library is stunning from every angle. The colleges themselves are architectural masterpieces, and while you can't enter all of them, the ones that are open to visitors will leave you speechless. Christ Church College, which inspired some Harry Potter scenes, was particularly impressive.

The city center is surprisingly compact, making it perfect for walking. I covered most of the main attractions in just a few hours. The best part? Everything is connected by these charming narrow lanes called ""passages"" that sometimes open up into unexpected courtyards or gardens.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Wear comfortable shoes (those cobblestones are no joke)
- Start early to avoid tourist crowds
- The Covered Market is great for lunch
- Don't skip the University Parks if you need a peaceful break

What made my experience even better was combining Oxford with visits to Stratford-upon-Avon and the Cotswolds. The tour I mentioned earlier handles all the logistics, which saved me from the hassle of planning multiple train trips.

One thing that surprised me was how student life blends seamlessly with tourism. You'll see students rushing to lectures while tour groups admire the same buildings they're entering. It creates this unique atmosphere that's both scholarly and welcoming.

If you're considering a visit, I'd really recommend checking out that guided tour (https://athometouch.com/London). Having a knowledgeable guide made the experience so much richer - they share stories and historical details you'd never find in guidebooks.

Oxford isn't just nice to walk around - it's spectacular. Every turn reveals another piece of history, another stunning view, or another cozy pub that's been serving students for centuries. Whether you're into architecture, history, literature, or just enjoy beautiful places, Oxford delivers on all fronts.

The walking experience here is different from other UK cities. It's more intimate, more connected to history, and somehow more alive. You're not just walking through a city - you're walking through centuries of learning, discovery, and tradition.

Trust me on this one - book that tour, pack comfortable shoes, and prepare to fall in love with Oxford's walkable charm. It's been over a week since my visit, and I'm already planning my next trip back.",1,1753032384.0,LetsGoTravelers,0,1.0,False

As someone who enjoys experimenting with brewing methods, I can confidently say this device stands out for many reasons. The conical shape and V-shaped paper filter combination are not just a visual delight but a functional masterpiece. Hot water flows seamlessly toward the cone's tip, extracting deep and flavorful notes from the coffee grounds. Before diving deeper into its pros and cons, let me walk you through my personal experiences and observations.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This clear, minimalist piece is a head-turner. The body, made of robust AS resin and polypropylene, feels lightweight yet durable. At only 3 ounces, it‚Äôs easy to handle but doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. Its matte exterior finish lends it a professional edge, even though it's priced affordably. As a fan of well-designed products, I appreciate the thought put into the ergonomics‚Äîholding it feels intuitively right. I‚Äôve accidentally dropped it twice on my kitchen counter, but not a crack or scratch has shown up, impressing me with its resilience.

**Performance and Function**  
The performance is top-tier for a manual coffee brewing tool. I‚Äôve been brewing both single-origin beans and blends. Amazingly, it captures their unique flavors consistently. This coffee dripper is designed to handle 1-4 servings, delivering about 4.2 fl oz per cup, which perfectly suits my morning coffee ritual with my partner. The manual operation mode may seem tedious for some, but for brewing enthusiasts like myself, the process feels meditative and rewarding.

**Positives**  
It offers several standout features that make it worth considering:  
- Dishwasher-safe and capable of withstanding boiling water without warping.  
- Compatible with a reusable filter, making it eco-friendly in the long run.  
- Winner of the 2007 Good Design Award, underlining its aesthetic value.  

[Check Hario VDR-02-T price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0bwhkpclj/)

**Usability and Ease of Use**  
This is where I feel a mixed bag of emotions. While the instructions for assembly and use were somewhat scarce (luckily, YouTube tutorials came in clutch), the actual brewing process was smooth. It's ideal for anyone with a basic understanding of pour-over techniques. My 17-year-old niece borrowed it for her first attempt at manual brewing and got the hang of it within three tries. It‚Äôs forgiving to a degree and performs well with minimal effort.

**Areas of Concern**  
However, no product is without its rough edges:  
- The clear resin tends to show watermarks after extended use, even with regular cleaning.  
- While sturdy, it‚Äôs not immune to heat discoloration if boiling liquids are poured multiple times in one go over years.  
- The reusable filter is decent but might not be as fine as high-end metal filters from competing brands.

**Challengers in the Market**  
Speaking of competitors, there are several solid alternatives. For example, the Chemex Pour-Over is an equally iconic device. Though Chemex scores higher on presentation‚Äîits wooden accents and glass body exude sophistication‚Äîit‚Äôs bulkier and less travel-friendly compared to the compact build of the Hario drip. On the other hand, products like the Kalita Wave Coffee Dripper offer arguably more even extraction, but they lean toward producing softer, less vibrant brews. For bolder coffee enthusiasts, this Hario model edges out with its flavor-forward extraction mechanics.

**Smart Spending**  
From all angles, it feels like a solid investment for its price point. You get a durable, lightweight, easy-to-clean tool that handles everyday brewing effortlessly. Many higher-priced drip systems might carry extra bells and whistles, but I never felt like I needed more while using this product. It balances quality and affordability in a surprisingly seamless manner.

Sam Altman just confirmed ChatGPT 5 comes out ""sometime this summer.""

While everyone else panics about AI taking jobs, smart business owners prepare to dominate their markets.

I'm Julian Goldie, and I've helped thousands of businesses implement AI automation.

Today I'm going to show you exactly how to prepare for ChatGPT 5.

The three changes that matter most.

And the step-by-step plan to implement ChatGPT 5 in your business.

Because when this launches, prepared businesses will crush unprepared competitors.

# üö® The 3 ChatGPT 5 Changes That Transform Your Business

Most people focus on technical specs.

Parameters and context windows and reasoning models.

That's not what matters for your business.

Here are the three changes that actually matter.

**Change #1: One AI Tool Replaces Everything**

Right now you probably use multiple AI tools.

ChatGPT for writing.

All in one place.

With persistent memory that remembers your business.

For your business, this means massive simplification.

No more switching between tools.

No more explaining context repeatedly.

No more managing multiple subscriptions.

One AI that knows your business inside and out.

**Change #2: AI Remembers Everything About Your Business**

Current AI tools forget you after each conversation.

Every chat starts from zero.

You explain your business over and over.

Provide context repeatedly.

Waste time on setup.

ChatGPT 5 has persistent memory.

It remembers your conversations.

Your preferences.

Your business context.

Your goals and challenges.

Every interaction builds on previous ones.

Like having an employee who never forgets anything.

For your business, this creates compound intelligence.

AI that gets smarter about your specific needs.

Recommendations that improve over time.

For your business, this democratizes intelligence.

Small companies can compete with large corporations.

Individual consultants can deliver enterprise-level insights.

Startups can access Fortune 500 strategic thinking.

The playing field gets leveled.

Content creation at scale?

Data analysis and insights?

Strategic planning support?

Process automation?

List your top 5 AI opportunities.

Rank them by potential business impact.

Focus on revenue generation first.

Cost reduction second.

Efficiency gains third.

**Step 3: Assess Your Team's AI Readiness**

How comfortable is your team with AI?

Who uses AI tools regularly?

Try to implement 10 use cases simultaneously.

Team gets overwhelmed.

Nothing gets implemented well.

Results disappoint.

Solution: Start with one high-impact use case.

Master it completely.

AI requires iteration and improvement.

First attempts rarely deliver optimal results.

Businesses give up too quickly.

Miss the long-term benefits.

Solution: Plan for 3-6 months of optimization.

Measure progress, not perfection.

Celebrate incremental improvements.

AI is only as good as the data you feed it.

Garbage in, garbage out.

Many businesses skip data cleanup.

Get poor AI results.

Solution: Invest time in organizing business data.

Clean customer information.

Document business processes.

Create clear data standards.

**Mistake #5: No Quality Control Process**

AI makes mistakes.

Especially in early implementation.

Businesses that don't build quality control suffer embarrassing errors.

Solution: Always have human oversight.

Create approval workflows.

Microwave- 20x14x11, probably about big enough to fit a dinner plate.

Filing cabinet/nightstand- I forgot to measure it, but it's similar to a medium-sized nightstand. I wouldn't recommend using it as a filing cabinet, as some of the rails to hold up the drawers are busted. Works fine for a few small items here and there, I just wouldn't try to store documents.

Lamp- Also forgot to measure, but it's a medium-sized floor lamp. Bought it open-box from an estate sale about a year ago, I believe it's Target brand.

1m4uca1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1m4uca1/paris_travel_report_and_lessons_learned/,Paris travel report and lessons learned,"Bonjour!

We have just returned to the US from an epic two week trip to France with my family (two adults and two teenagers).  I learned so much from this sub that I'd like to share our lessons learned and some gems from our trip. This is long so feel free to skip to the summary at the end.

Pre-trip:  I started Duolingo about three months prior to the trip and that was enough to get me to the point where I could do VERY basic things in French.  I tried French with everyone, and with the exception of one barista, they were all willing to let me practice and seemed genuinely pleased that I was making the effort even though I sound like an American speaking toddler French with a Spanish accent. I found Parisians in general to be friendly and helpful, and the stereotype that Paris is a city of beautiful people is not without merit.

Trip: I'm a Delta FF so flew Air France (booked on Delta) from IAD.  I got the ""premium economy"" seats in hopes of getting some sleep.  The actual seats were apparently an old model that is being phased out and while they were spacious they were not particularly comfortable, but the noise cancelling headphones were a nice touch.  The real advantage of this fare class was Sky Priority status.

Arrival:  With Sky Priority status, we were able to use expedited arrival lanes and were through immigration and had our bags in about 45 minutes.  This was worth the extra ticket price alone.

CDG to Paris:  Based on advice here I used Welcome Pickups.  Slightly more expensive than a cab but prepaid and the driver was waiting for us.  I chose this because I was not excited about trying to navigate taxis or metro in a new city on no sleep with minimal language skills.  I think for us the extra expense was again worth it.

Paris:  We stayed in an AirBnB on Isle St Louis and for a tourist it was a great location.  The flat itself was two bedrooms and while small (like everywhere) the space was used very efficiently and it was a very comfortable spot for us.  DM me for the link if you are interested.

Activities:  Our first full day we took a guided tour of the latin quarter with an independent guide I found on this page:  [https://fngic.fr/en](https://fngic.fr/en) . You can find a guide here for anything you can imagine at much less than the price of the tour agencies.  Very highly recommended.

Versailles: We took an Uber there, which was interesting to see the city, and Metro back.  Speaking of Metro it was mildly complex but doable and the metro app (IDF Mobilities) was easy to use and very helpful (though I never could get the feature where I reloaded passes on the phone to work on my phone). We elected to use physical passes since there were 4 of us and we didn't always have all the phones.

Anyway Versailles was, while spectacular in many ways, my personal least favorite part of the visit. Kid 1 and I went to the palace while wife and kid 2 went for a paddle on the grand canal.  Part of the gardens is free all summer, while part is not - they are playing classical music so the gardens are ""singing"" so an entrance fee is charged.  There is also a fee when fountains are running.  You can only enter through a single gate once, but can leave an enter again through a different gate which is often a long walk away.  Overall a confusing and apparently unnecessarily complex system that made meeting wife and kid logistically challenging after the palace tour.  However, what we got right was bringing a picnic and eating that beside the Grand Canal which was lovely.

Catacombs:  If you want to go in peak months, tickets disappear FAST.  They open up exactly 7 days (to the minute) ahead of time, so I had to wake up at 3:45 am to get ours before we left.  I was too slow in choosing my ticket types and the slot sold out in under 2 minutes, so I had to wait 15 minutes for the next slot.  This time I was ready and successful.  We went in the morning but this is a decent afternoon activity since the catacombs are always cool.  Overall this was our favorite touristy thing to do in the city as we were able to spread out from the group and experience it at our own pace and even with a bit of solitude.

Musee d'Orsay: We went Thursday night when they are open late.  It was too crowded but I'm glad I went.

Louvre: Get a private guide from the website above.  Just trust me - it's worth every euro. We skipped the Mona Lisa and went to some lesser visited parts of the museum.

Eiffel Tower: We went after Orsay to watch it light up at sunset, along with every other tourist in Paris. Combining the two is a good way to spend an evening.  Metro between the two is super easy.  We left after the RER had closed but it was easy to find the alternate station - just follow the hordes of people.

Notre Dame: If you really like standing in line, you can go without a reservation. If you prefer to spend that time eating ice cream along the Seine, get the official Notre Dame app ""Notre Dame de Paris"" and book a free appointment. We got one same day.

Musee de fromage: On Isle St Louis.  A highlight of the trip.  Trust me and go, particularly if you like cheese.

Food:  This may be a hot take, but finding good food was difficult, since tourists apparently all want to eat frog legs, escargot, and French onion soup.  We had one traditional French meal at a restaurant recommended by our guide which was good but in general not my style (before you flame me, I know there are lots of small amazing places away from the tourist spots). However I have two strong recommendations:

Petit Dakar (Senegalese in the Marais): [https://www.lepetitdakar.com/en](https://www.lepetitdakar.com/en)

Bontemps Jardin Secret (brunch and possibly the best meal we had in Paris): [https://bontemps.paris](https://bontemps.paris)

The ice cream at Bertillon is worth the hype.  Get you some at the OG place on Isle St Louis and take it down to the Seine to snack.

  
Coffee: Noir on Isle St Louis was good, as was the cafeotheque just on the other side of the river in the Marais.

Patisserie:  Boulangerie la Tour in the Latin Quarter.  Excellent pastries and takeout sandwiches (we took these to Versailles).

Security: I took reasonable security precautions and never felt unsafe.  I kept my hand on my wallet and phone on the metro and in crowded places and otherwise didn't worry about pickpockets.  I did know to ignore the people with clipboards outside the Louvre but otherwise no issues with scammers.

Dress: Just get linen pants and adidas and you will be fine

Flying home:  We left Paris and spent a week playing in the Vosges mountains with some friends and seeing a stage of the Tour at Hautacam in a camper van, then took the train back to Paris where we spent the last night in the Sheraton at CDG. It was not the most picturesque place but after a long day of travel by road and train to get back from the Pyrenees it was nice to have a low stress morning.  Once again the Sky Priority lanes made leaving CDG a breeze.

Speaking of trains, if you are traveling around France and have a connection MAKE SURE IT IS THE SAME STATION.  We realized (in time, fortunately) in Marseilles that we needed to get to a different station to switch from Intercities to TGV.

US customs:  Get the CBP MPC app and save yourself a lot of time.

Thanks to everyone who unknowingly helped me plan an epic trip for my people.

TLDR:

1. if in your budget Sky Priority is worth it for CDG entry/exit

2. Isle St Louis was a great central location for seeing the city

3. Use the website above for private guides (especially for the Louvre) and don't use the big companies.  Much cheaper and more money goes to the guide.

4. Get a guide for the Louvre

5. Consider doing Thursday evening hours at Musee d'Orsay and sunset at Eiffel Tower together

6. Catacombs tickets go fast but totally worth it

7. Leave some of your time unscheduled for drinking coffee, wandering along the Seine, and eating bread and cheese.

8. Speaking of cheese please visit Musee de Fromage [https://musee-fromage-paris.com/en/tickets/](https://musee-fromage-paris.com/en/tickets/)

9. Download the CBP MPC app for US customs

10. Take the metro (use the IDF Mobilities app)

11. A little tiny bit of French goes a very long way for goodwill

Maybe you all can help me out with describing more specifics. How do these four scents change, if they do to you? 

But I think these four have a scent journey and shift a lot on the skin. In mostly nice ways. I do recommend spraying on skin and wearing for thirty minutes to an hour at least. 

* Glazed Pumpkin - becomes a sugared musk actually a bit like the caramel notes of this year‚Äôs Blush Cardigan. Just a faint resemblance. Does it get deeper or a bit fruity even? Really hard to tell with all the fragrances I was spraying. Help me out.
* Vanilla Cafe - the beginning is the exact, realistic scent of hazelnut coffee creamer (coffee mate, international delight maybe). The dry down is a different story. The coffee creamer dissipates by a lot. And it resolves into a more balanced, slightly deeper, sugared musk to my nose. I prefer the dry down as the coffee creamer note is a bit thin, sharp and artificial, like Coffee Mate hazelnut, vs a Starbucks hazelnut creamer. I would drink both, but just prefer Starbucks coffee creamer (more balanced, even). 
* Vanilla Cafe - starts off a bright, transparent lavender. Mostly fades and becomes a nice, neutral vanilla (like lavender luxe, but less lavender, or vanilla romance, no smoke). And then finally does kinda smell like vanilla romance, the vanilla part, with a hint of cardamom out of nowhere. 
* Sweater Weather - now this is a faint one, hard to smell. It starts off more green apple and ends up cologne? Where does that come from. This is another one I don‚Äôt know if I mixed fragrances together. Does it become cologne to you?

# Whip It Replacement Parts: 2025's Top Guide!

The ""Whip It"" brand is synonymous with nitrous oxide whipped cream dispensers, commonly used in both professional kitchens and home settings. These dispensers rely on various parts that can wear out over time or get damaged, leading to the need for replacements. Properly functioning replacement parts are crucial to ensuring the dispenser operates efficiently and safely, maintaining consistent performance and preventing potential hazards. this guide focuses on the essential replacement parts for Whip It dispensers, offering insights into their functionality, durability, and the best options available in 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated whip it replacement parts on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=whip it replacement parts)

## Key Features Analysis

The longevity and performance of a ""Whip It"" dispenser depend heavily on the quality of its constituent parts. Understanding the key features of these replacement parts is crucial for making informed purchasing decisions.

**Dispenser Head:** The dispenser head is the central component responsible for controlling the release of nitrous oxide and whipped cream mixture. A high-quality dispenser head is typically made from stainless steel or durable plastic, ensuring resistance to corrosion and wear from repeated use.

The dispenser head should feature a precise valve mechanism that allows for consistent and controlled dispensing. Leakproof sealing is critical to prevent gas leakage, which can compromise the performance of the dispenser and pose a safety risk. Features like adjustable flow control can also enhance the user experiance, allowing more customized dispensing.

**Charger Holder (Cartridge holder):** The charger holder, also known as the cartridge holder, is the part that securely holds the nitrous oxide cartridge in place. Durability is paramount for this component, as it endures meaningful pressure during the charging process.

A high-quality charger holder is constructed from reinforced materials such as stainless steel or heavy-duty aluminum. Its design should ensure a tight seal around the cartridge neck to prevent gas leakage. Precision threading is also necessary to facilitate secure attachment to the dispenser head,ensuring a stable connection during operation.

**Nozzles (Tips):** Nozzles, or tips, are interchangeable attachments that fit onto the dispenser head to create different whipped cream designs. They are typically made from stainless steel or food-grade plastic and come in various shapes and sizes.

The quality of the nozzles is essential for achieving desired aesthetic results. Smooth, burr-free edges ensure clean and consistent dispensing patterns. Nozzles should also be easy to attach and detach from the dispenser head, and be dishwasher safe for easy cleaning. Stainless steel nozzles offer superior durability and resistance to staining compared to plastic alternatives.

**Seals and Gaskets:** Seals and gaskets are small but essential components that prevent gas leakage from the dispenser.They are typically made from rubber or silicone, ensuring a tight and airtight seal between different parts.

The quality of seals and gaskets is directly related to the dispenser's performance and safety.High-quality materials can withstand repeated compression and exposure to nitrous oxide without degrading or losing their sealing properties. It is recommended to replace seals and gaskets periodically to maintain peak performance and prevent gas leakage.

**Piston and Valve Components:** These components work together within the dispenser head to control the flow of nitrous oxide and whipped cream. The piston, typically made from stainless steel or durable plastic, moves within the valve to regulate the release of the mixture.

Precise manufacturing and tight tolerances are essential for the proper functioning of these components. A smoothly operating piston ensures consistent dispensing and prevents uneven pressure distribution. High-quality materials are needed to withstand the chemical effects of nitrous oxide and the physical wear from repeated use.

## Core Benefits

replacing worn or damaged parts ensures the ""Whip It"" dispenser continues to deliver optimal performance and benefits its users.

**Maintained Performance:** Replacing worn parts, such as the dispenser head or seals, ensures consistent pressure and dispensing. A dispenser with functioning components will produce even, stabilized whipped cream, enhancing the quality and presentation of desserts and beverages. replacing worn seals will also prevent gas leakage, maintaining the dispenser's efficiency and reliability.

**Enhanced safety:** Damaged or improperly functioning parts can pose safety risks. Gas leaks can lead to improper pressure buildup or nitrous oxide escaping into the habitat. Replacing worn or damaged seals and cartridge holders prevents these hazards, ensuring users can enjoy whipped cream without safety concerns.A properly maintained dispenser is less likely to malfunction unexpectedly during use.

**Extended Dispenser Lifespan:** Regularly replacing worn parts,rather than waiting for complete failure,can significantly extend the dispenser's lifespan.Replacing seals, nozzles, and charger holders prevents wear on other components, ensuring each part works optimally and the overall unit remains functional for years. This preventative maintenance approach is cost-effective in the long run.

**Improved Hygiene:** Damaged nozzles or worn seals can harbor bacteria and are difficult to clean thoroughly. Replacing these components regularly helps maintain high hygiene standards, especially important in professional kitchen settings. New nozzles and seals ensure direct contact with whipped cream is clean, fresh, and sanitary.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** although replacement parts represent an upfront investment, they avoid the higher cost of replacing an entire whipped cream dispenser. Replacing a worn seal or charger holder is significantly cheaper than purchasing a new unit. This approach to dispenser management provides significant savings over time, notably for establishments that frequently use whipped cream dispensers.

## FAQs Section

No, Whip it replacement parts are specifically designed for Whip It brand whipped cream dispensers. While some parts may fit other brands, it is indeed not recommended to use them interchangeably due to variations in size, thread patterns, and material compositions.Using non-compatible parts can damage the dispenser or compromise its performance.

**How often should I replace the O-rings and seals in my whip It dispenser?**
O-rings and seals should be inspected regularly for signs of wear and tear, such as cracks, dryness, or deformation. as a general guideline, it's recommended to replace them every 3 to 6 months, depending on usage frequency.Heavy usage requires more frequent replacement, while less frequent usage allows for longer intervals. Regular replacement maintains optimal performance and prevents gas leaks.

**Where can I find genuine Whip It replacement parts?**
Genuine Whip It replacement parts can be purchased from authorized retailers, kitchen supply stores, and online marketplaces. Be cautious when purchasing from unverified sources, as counterfeit parts may not meet the same quality standards and could damage your dispenser or pose safety risks. Always look for the Whip It branding and packaging to ensure you're getting authentic parts.

**Can I repair a damaged dispenser head, or is it better to replace it?**
The decision to repair or replace a damaged dispenser head depends on the extent of the damage. Minor issues, such as a loose nozzle attachment, can frequently enough be repaired. Though, if the dispenser head is cracked, excessively corroded, or if the valve mechanism is faulty, it's generally safer and more cost-effective to replace it. A damaged dispenser head can compromise the integrity of the dispenser and potentially lead to safety hazards.

I know people get sleepy in the morning but holy shit. 

I swear to god people set alarms for attention. 

If you‚Äôre really that fucking deep in the trenches, pull an all nighter, go outside at like 8 am and drink a cup of coffee while in the sun, pass out at 12 am, and wake up again with ONE (or two ig) alarms. Do that everytime your dumb ass decides to go to bed at 4. 

It‚Äôs literally not hard and I‚Äôm not saying that because I think I‚Äôm cunty or something I‚Äôve never been more serious in my life. 

Just go to bed at like 10 if you know you have shit to do in the morning and then I don‚Äôt wanna hear shit. The ONLY reason I‚Äôm waking you up is because you went to bed an hour and a half before you were meant to wake up.

1m4typ8,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1m4typ8/explore_chefman_electric_kettle_review_is_this/,Explore Chefman Electric Kettle Review Is This the Best Choice for Tea Lovers?,"The Chefman RJ11-17-CTI-RL Electric Kettle has become a regular part of my daily kitchen routine, and let me tell you, I‚Äôve got opinions. This beautifully designed glass and stainless steel kettle is more than your average water boiler, boasting features like temperature control, rapid boil, and a removable tea infuser. With Chefman‚Äôs reputation for kitchen appliances, expectations were high, and for the most part, this electric kettle delivers.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Its sleek appearance immediately caught my eye. The combination of glass and stainless steel feels modern while still being functional. The kettle offers a 1.8L capacity, which is enough to fill multiple mugs or a teapot, making it an excellent choice for family tea time or gatherings. The LED lights beneath the kettle not only look cool but correspond to different modes, like standby, heat, and steep. It‚Äôs a sturdy appliance that doesn‚Äôt feel cheap, and the glass material even offers thermal shock resistance‚Äîbonus points for durability in everyday use. However, as pretty as the glass is, it does demand consistent cleaning to maintain its clarity.

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this kettle couldn‚Äôt be easier. Variable heat settings with seven presets let me choose precise temperatures for different purposes like brewing green tea or boiling water for instant noodles. The included removable tea infuser is a game changer. I‚Äôve brewed loose-leaf tea so effortlessly that my old teapot now seems redundant. The 360-degree swivel base provides flexibility, and the cordless design allows for portability, which means I can pour hot water anywhere without dragging the base around with me.  

[Check Chefman RJ11-17-CTI-RL price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b07fnw57j7/)

**Performance and Features**  
The kettle heats water incredibly fast‚Äîseriously, I‚Äôve timed it at about three minutes for a full boil. The safety shutoff feature ensures peace of mind by automatically turning off when the water reaches boiling or runs dry. As someone who‚Äôs accidentally left appliances running, I appreciate this a lot. It also has a ""keep warm"" mode that‚Äôs ideal when I want back-to-back cups of tea. The tri-color LED system is intuitive, turning from white to red to green depending on the mode. Honestly, it‚Äôs the kind of visual cue that‚Äôs helpful even when you‚Äôre groggy in the morning.

**Key Benefits**  
- Rapid boiling saves time when you‚Äôre rushing in the morning.  
- Tri-color LED indicators make it easy to monitor the kettle‚Äôs status.  
- Seven temperature presets cater to tea, coffee, and more.  
- Removable tea infuser elevates the tea-brewing experience.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Glass design requires frequent cleaning to avoid looking cloudy.  
- It‚Äôs a bit heavier compared to some other kettles.  
- The lid, while removable for easier cleaning, can feel clunky when reattaching.  

**Alternative Products**  
I‚Äôve dabbled with a handful of competing electric kettles before landing on this one. The Cuisinart CPK-17 is often proudly showcased in kitchens and offers similar temperature controls but lacks the sleek glass design and tri-color LEDs that make the Chefman unique. On the other hand, the OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Kettle has an exceptionally smooth interface but doesn‚Äôt come with a tea infuser, which is a downside for tea enthusiasts like me. While competitors have their merits, the Chefman strikes a balance between affordability, aesthetics, and functionality, earning its spot as a top contender in the category.

**Price Performance**  
Considering the range of features packed into this kettle, it offers exceptional cost-effectiveness. The rapid boil, customizable temperatures, and tea infusion capabilities make it a multi-use kitchen tool worth its cost. Competitors at a similar price point either lack the Chefman‚Äôs versatility or sacrifice aesthetic appeal. Additionally, its durable glass and stainless steel construction mean it‚Äôs built to last, lowering its long-term cost.

1m4typ0,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1m4typ0/does_the_homenjoy_hey001_water_filter_deliver/,Does the Homenjoy HEY001 Water Filter Deliver Pure Water? In-Depth Review,"Testing the **Homenjoy HEY001 W10295370A Water Filter Replacement** has been a genuinely interesting experience. I‚Äôve been using it daily, especially because my family and I are heavy water consumers‚Äîcoffee, tea, and just staying hydrated in general. This 3-pack of filters is BPA-free and NSF-certified, which adds a level of trust I look for in any product meant for ingestion. However, while it performs well overall, I think a balanced review should address both its positives and room for improvement.

**PURE WATER: HIGHLIGHTS OF FILTRATION QUALITY**  
Honestly, I‚Äôm kind of picky about water quality. This filter boasts a second-generation carbon system made from Sri Lankan coconut shell, and let me tell you, it shows. My water smells and tastes significantly purer now‚Äîno more chemical odors or leftover chlorine flavors. In quick tests with a simple TDS meter, the filter seemed to handle reducing impurities like sediment and lead quite well. The multi-stage filtration process is a standout, and the precision aperture of less than 0.5 microns is remarkable. I don‚Äôt say this often, but it makes daily consumption genuinely enjoyable.  
[Check Homenjoy HEY001 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0ddl59k7h/)

**EFFORTLESS INSTALLATION EXPERIENCE**  
I‚Äôm notorious for messing up simple tasks, so the ease of installation was a huge selling point for me. This filter doesn‚Äôt require tools, and I had it up and running in under five minutes flat. It‚Äôs compatible with quite a few refrigerator models like EDR1RXD1 and W10295370A, which makes it versatile, and, more importantly, it fit perfectly into my Whirlpool fridge without me breaking a sweat. That kind of hassle-free user experience is priceless (or at least worth the cost of this purchase).

**STURDY BUILD AND RELIABILITY**  
Durability isn‚Äôt something you usually associate with a water filter, but this little gadget surprises. Passing through a 400 PSI burst-pressure test and 100,000 water hammer tests is no small feat. From my time using it, even with our frequent water extractions, there hasn‚Äôt been so much as an inkling of leakage. It seems like the sealing ring at the top does its job well. I also appreciate the six-month or 200-gallon lifespan for each unit. I plan to see just how long I can stretch it out before noticing any performance changes.

**ADVANTAGES**  
- Taste and odor of water dramatically improved.  
- No-tool assembly made the setup user-friendly.  
- Durable enough to handle consistent, high use.  

**CAVEATS**  
- Despite a leak-free design, the flow rate seems a little slower compared to more premium filters.  
- The filter doesn‚Äôt entirely remove all dissolved solids, which might bug sticklers for purist water quality.  
- Installation, while simple for most, might still confuse users who don‚Äôt align it properly the first time.

**PERK: ECO-FRIENDLY AND SAFETY-CERTIFIED MATERIALS**  
Knowing this filter is made from food-grade materials and is BPA-free reassured me as a parent. Additionally, it has NSF/ANSI certifications, so I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs more than just a well-designed product; it‚Äôs genuinely safe. The focus on using safer materials reduces the ‚Äòwhat am I ingesting‚Äô anxiety that sometimes comes with budget-friendly units. 

**Customer Support: Reliable, But With a Catch**  
The cherry on top is their no-return-needed replacement policy for unsatisfied customers. I haven‚Äôt had to use it myself, but knowing the option exists adds peace of mind. A small hiccup though‚Äîsome other reviewers reported delays in responses when reaching out, especially during peak seasons. It‚Äôs probably not a consistent issue, but it‚Äôs worth a mention.

**PRODUCT CONTENDERS**  
Comparisons are inevitable, with alternatives like EveryDrop Filter 1 frequently mentioned in reviews. While the EveryDrop wins on lifespan per cartridge, I feel the Homenjoy HEY001 edges out in affordability and quick setup. Another competitor, the Kenmore 46-9081, offers equally fast installation but seems to have a higher failure rate in leakage prevention. At this price point, the Homenjoy positions itself as a fantastic middle-road option if you value decent performance without splurging.

**AFFORDABLE QUALITY AS A SELLING POINT**  
From a price-performance perspective, this product offers good value. While it‚Äôs not the cheapest filter on the market, the features justify the cost. Most importantly, the long lifespan of each filter offsets the need for frequent replacements, making it a thoughtful buy for budget-conscious families. Sure, premium models may outshine it in certain technical aspects, but paying double doesn‚Äôt always mean you‚Äôll see double the benefits.

1m4txof,https://www.reddit.com/r/Immune_system_boost/comments/1m4txof/whats_your_goto_morning_drink_for_immune_support/,What's your go-to morning drink for immune support? Here's what actually works (backed by research),"Hey everyone! After dealing with constant seasonal bugs and feeling run down, I dove deep into research on morning drinks that actually boost immune function. Thought I'd share what I found since so many of us are looking for natural ways to stay healthier.

# Why morning drinks matter for immunity

Turns out 70% of our immune system is in our gut, and what we drink first thing can seriously impact how well our defenses work. The morning window is clutch because our bodies are transitioning from rest mode and absorption rates are at their peak.

Studies show consuming antioxidant-rich drinks within the first hour of waking can increase immune cell activity by up to 40%. Pretty solid reason to upgrade from just coffee, right?

# What's actually been working for me (and the science behind it):

**1. Lemon-ginger-turmeric shot** This combo is legit. The vitamin C, gingerol, and curcumin work together really well. Research shows regular consumption can cut cold symptoms by 35%. I do half a lemon, 1 tsp grated ginger, 1/2 tsp turmeric in warm water. Tastes like health in a glass lol.

**2. Green tea with good honey** Green tea has EGCG which boosts T-cell production by 25% according to clinical trials. I use Manuka honey (the expensive stuff) because it has actual antimicrobial properties. Game changer for gut health.

**3. Elderberry mix** My grandma was right about this one. Modern studies confirm elderberry can cut respiratory infection duration by 2-4 days. I mix elderberry syrup with warm water and lemon juice.

**4. Bone broth** Sounds weird but hear me out. The collagen and amino acids support gut lining repair, which is your first immune defense. Plus it's actually really satisfying on cold mornings.

**5. Matcha smoothie** 137x more antioxidants than regular green tea. I blend matcha powder with banana, spinach, and almond milk. The L-theanine keeps you calm while supporting immune function.

**6. Kefir drinks** Over 30 strains of beneficial bacteria. Studies show regular kefir consumption increases natural killer cell activity by 30%. Way better than regular yogurt drinks.

**7. Superfood powder mixes** For lazy mornings (most mornings tbh), I've been using powder blends that combine multiple immune-supporting ingredients. Way more convenient than making everything from scratch.

I recently started using Tonic Greens after a friend recommended it. It's got 57 different superfoods and probiotics all in one scoop, which honestly saves me so much time. Instead of buying and prepping 6+ different ingredients, I just mix one powder with water. Game changer for consistency.

[**Here is the 7 Powerful Morning Drinks That Skyrocket Your Immune System in 30 Days (Science-Backed Results!)**](https://backsupplements.com/7-powerful-morning-drinks)

# FAQ from friends/family who asked:

**Q: How fast do you see results?** Energy boost in 3-7 days, actual immune improvements after 2-3 weeks of consistency.

**Q: Can you mix multiple drinks?** I rotate different ones throughout the week rather than combining. Keeps it interesting and prevents your body from getting too used to one thing.

**Q: Best timing?** Within 30 minutes of waking, empty stomach if possible.

**Q: Any side effects?** Most are pretty safe, but start small if you have a sensitive stomach. If you have autoimmune issues, definitely check with your doc first.

# What's worked best in my routine:

I pick 2-3 options and rotate weekly rather than trying everything at once. Consistency beats perfection. Set phone reminders for the first month until it becomes habit.

Batch prep saves time - I make ginger-turmeric paste in advance, freeze lemon juice in ice cube trays, and pre-portion any powders.

Quality matters more than I expected. Organic ingredients have way higher concentrations of the good stuff.

# Results after 3 months:

* Way more energy throughout the day
* Haven't gotten sick once (used to get 2-3 colds per year)
* Sleep quality improved
* Less afternoon crashes
* Generally feel more resilient

# Tips that made the difference:

1. **Start with ONE drink** \- Don't overwhelm yourself
2. **Track how you feel** \- I used a simple 1-10 energy scale daily
3. **Adjust seasonally** \- More vitamin C stuff during cold season
4. **Combine with other good habits** \- Sleep, exercise, stress management all work together

The whole routine takes maybe 5 minutes but the impact has been huge. Small consistent changes really add up.

**For anyone looking for the easiest way to get started:** I know some people asked about the Tonic Greens I mentioned - it's honestly been the most convenient option for me. They have a 20% discount going on right now for new customers, plus free shipping. Way cheaper than buying all the individual ingredients separately, and you get way more nutrients. If you're someone who struggles with consistency (like I was), having everything pre-measured in one powder makes it foolproof.

1m4twa5,https://patch.com/california/losalamitos/slurs-main-street-how-trump-themed-store-roiling-seal-beach,Hate shop in liberal California,"So mature‚Ä¶

*""I think it's real childish on their part. As mature right-wing people, we think it's funny because it proves how unhinged and dumb they are.""*



SEAL BEACH, CA ‚Äî Ava Langdon was walking along Main Street in Seal Beach with her uncle and his girlfriend when they saw a store that appeared to be Trump-themed.

Her uncle and his girlfriend, both Republicans, decided to check it out. Langdon, who says she identifies more with left-wing values, was hesitant to go in at first, she told Patch. But wanting to remain with her family, she decided to follow suit.

That's when she first saw a shirt reading: ""Transgender Women Are Just Ret***ed F*gs."" Currently, the shirt centers the store's window display facing Main Street, a couple of doors down from Cold Stone Creamery.

""I was honestly extremely shocked at first that someone would put such a hateful thing on a shirt,"" Langdon told Patch. ""It wasn't just offensive, it was pure hate speech.""

The shirt was so shocking, Langdon said, that even her uncle and girlfriend left the store appalled. That's when, to their dismay, according to Langdon, a woman came out of the store and started accosting them.

""It honestly made me feel like she was overcompensating by trying to intimidate us because she knew that selling a shirt with that kind of hate speech was wrong,"" Langdon said. ""It was almost like she sensed something bad was going to come from this.""

Langdon's experience is one of many incidents and complaints about the store Beachin lodged with community officials and reviewed by Patch. But Frank Ryan, the store's owner, sees things differently.

Ryan, who described Beachin as ""anti-left and anti-agenda,"" said most community members in Seal Beach have been receptive to his storefront. Anyone who has anything bad to say about him is making themselves out to be a victim, Ryan said.

""Hate comes from people not agreeing with the store based on what they see,"" Ryan told Patch. ""They're the ones that want to come at me. We just retaliate back.""

Seal Beach was once considered California's ""Sin City"" in its early days due to its lack of police enforcement, its reputation as a drop-off point for rum runners during prohibition and prostitution along Main Street.

Today, it's a quaint family-oriented town located between liberal Long Beach and deep red Huntington Beach. It's a small coastal tourist city with about 26,000 people and a naval base that brings marines and sailors from around the country to town. Dotted with ice cream parlors, salons and coffee houses, Main Street is a hub for stroller brigades and a place where retirees gather to discuss the news of the day.

Despite its quiet energy, the city is divided politically, with neighborhoods such as Surfside and the Navy base voting Republican in the 2024 election, while The Hill, College Park and Leisure World voted blue during last year's election. Old Towne, where Beachin is located, was evenly split.

Ryan, Beachin's owner, was running a novelty store in Los Angeles when the pandemic began. He says city officials in Los Angeles tried to press charges against him for failing to follow the city's COVID-19 protocols.

By 2023, he'd closed down his shop and moved to the Seal Beach location, where his store remains today next to a dive bar popular with the military and near an ice cream parlor, a Sweet Jill's bakery and a shell shop.

Back then, his store sold all kinds of items, he said. Though he soon realized that anything politically controversial ‚Äî mostly anti-left ‚Äî sold the best. Soon, he began selling only items that were anti-liberal or anti-trans movement, he said.

That's when he started seeing more and more right-wing supporters coming through his shop.

""We all, as a whole, needed a store like this to express our feelings,"" he said. ""Everyone thought we were surrounded by left people. This store gave us a voice, gave local people a voice, actually gave people nationwide a voice.""

And business is going well, according to Ryan, who said he is visited by supporters from other states and countries as far as Australia. For every one or two negative comments he receives, Ryan says he gains hundreds more supporters. He's even started social media pages for his business, where he posts encounters with people he clashes with politically or others he claims bash his store due to his ideals.

""Everything we do and post, they started first, but they want to turn into the victim next,"" Ryan said. ""Watch the videos, you'll see they're the ones there calling me a Nazi, fascist and bigot. We're tired of being quiet. We're over it.""

But interviews with community members and complaints filed with the city share a different perspective.

One complaint filed in 2024 accuses Ryan of using his storefront to promote ""racism, homophobia and transphobia.‚Äù

""I find it appalling and reprehensible that this store exists and is being allowed to conduct business, especially with families and tourists visiting the area,"" the complaint states. ""Such actions are deeply troubling and do not reflect the inclusive and welcoming values that our community stands for.""

A visitor from Minnesota complained last year that the Beachin was displaying ""extremely divisive and vulgar"" merchandise.

""If someone was not a regular to Seal Beach, they might come away with the impression that racism and misogyny are alive, well and celebrated by businesses in your highly visible downtown corridor,"" the complaint reads.

Another complaint accused the city of being complacent after a Beachin social media post appears to call out a local business owner for kicking out a family from a restaurant for wearing a Trump hat.

""Attacking a local mainstay in Seal Beach. When will this insanity end? When will the city grow a spine and do something?"" the complaint reads.

The T-shirt reading ""Transgender Women Are Just Ret***ed F**s"" is his best-selling item of all time, Ryan said.

Although some people complain about him and his products, Ryan maintains that he's simply exercising his freedom of speech. He also doesn't see the complaints against him as a problem.

""I think they're more entertainment,"" Ryan said. ""I think it's real childish on their part. As mature right-wing people, we think it's funny because it proves how unhinged and dumb they are.""

""This is our freedom of speech. This is our way of protesting without vandalizing and burning shit down,"" Ryan said. ""If you're that offended by a t-shirt, you have problems. You need to talk to a doctor.""

But what Ryan calls ""just a funny t-shirt"" is indicative of a larger issue in the United States affecting transgender people, according to Seal Beach resident Stephanie Wade.

""I find it extremely offensive,"" Wade, a transwoman, said. ""I think it gives the whole city a black eye.""

The Trump administration's anti-trans crusade is, simply put, erasure, Wade said. And Ryan's merchandise serves as a way to perpetrate that anti-trans violence and ignorance onto community members, Wade added.

She said all this is happening so that it's ""open season on (trans people), so we can be harassed, beaten.""

Wade said she's experienced some of those issues firsthand.

""Seal Beach has metastasized, like Huntington Beach, into a xenophobic, overtly Christian, antagonistic to anything that's not heteronormative and white, city,"" Wade told Patch.

Wade said she ran for a city council seat in 2022 and was widely supported by many community members. However, her opponent, she said, ran a largely homophobic and transphobic campaign against her.

Wade ended up losing in the special election, but she, along with other community members, was determined to create a sense of belonging in Seal Beach.

In 2023, she started a nonprofit with a few other community members to put on a family-friendly pride event. They raised thousands of dollars, booked six queer acts and tried to put on a festival at Eisenhower Park near Main Street.

That's when, Wade said, Ryan made it his ""personal campaign"" to stop the event ‚Äî organizing a counter protest.

""They wanted to have a drag show at the public park, and 90% of the community didn't want the drag show,"" Ryan said. ""(The) majority of the community doesn't agree with men in costume using women's facilities, and that's what they wanted to do with their drag show at the kids' park.""

Wade said she filed a police report against Ryan after he made a video where he doxxed her and made threats towards her, despite never actually having met in person.

Reports of cyberstalking, Wade said, have gone largely unanswered, with police telling her the issue has become too politicized. Multiple people said they reported ""doxxing"" or harassment linked to the store to police and business leaders in the city.

‚ÄúWe take all reports of criminal activity seriously, regardless of the alleged victim or suspect, and investigate each allegation to the fullest extent. Cases with possible filing charges are then forwarded to the District Attorney for consideration,"" a Seal Beach Police Department Lt. Julia Clasb told Patch. ""Protecting our residents‚Äô safety and privacy is a top priority. Anyone with additional information or who believes they have been targeted is encouraged to contact our Investigations Unit via the Seal Beach PD non‚Äëemergency dispatch line at (562) 594‚Äë7232.‚Äù

""This guy‚Äôs the worst of it, and the police have chosen to do nothing,"" Wade said. ""I do not feel that I've been fairly supported or that the community has been fairly supported by the Seal Beach Police Department.""

Accounts of sidewalk altercations outside the store abound on social media.

A reddit page calling out the store staff and patrons for altercations with passersby quickly garnered more than 100 comments or stories of harassment.

""This store is a danger to the community,"" one person posted. ""I don‚Äôt care particularly about their political beliefs, it is what it is, but it seems to me that they hang out around the store trying to get a rise out of people so they can harass them. Some of the stuff the store sells is pretty explicit and obviously hateful, and the people who loiter around it clearly are the same. Be careful.""

Another commenter wondered if Main Street was no longer a safe place for families to visit.

""These shops make it feel that way on purpose,"" another replied. ""They don't represent everyone who lives in the city.""

# What You Need to Get Started

Before we go into the methods, here‚Äôs what you‚Äôll need:

* A laptop or smartphone with internet access
* A Google account
* Basic understanding of Google Maps (zoom, search, view business profiles)[](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)
* Optional: Canva, ChatGPT, Google Docs, or a basic website builder

You don‚Äôt need to spend any money to get started‚Äîmost tools are free.

# 1.¬†Local SEO Services for Small Businesses

Many small businesses are either missing from¬†[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†Maps or have poorly optimized listings. That means when people search for ‚Äúplumber near me‚Äù or ‚Äúbest salon in \[your city\],‚Äù they don‚Äôt show up‚Äîor they appear with no reviews, bad photos, or missing info.

**Your job? Help them fix that.**

Here‚Äôs what you can do:

* **Search local businesses on Google Maps.**¬†Look for ones with no reviews, missing hours, bad images, or no website listed.
* **Reach out to them.**¬†You can email, call, or even walk in. Mention that you noticed their listing could use improvements and offer to fix it.
* **What you can offer:**
   * Add or update their Google Business Profile
   * Upload better photos
   * Add accurate business hours
   * Write or edit their business description
   * Help them get more reviews (ethically‚Äîby asking happy customers to leave feedback)

You can charge anywhere from¬†**$50 to $500+ per**¬†[**business**](https://tchelete.com/how-to-start-a-business-from-the-ground-up-that-thrives/), depending on how much you do.

# 2.¬†Freelance Mapping for Local Guides Program

[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†has a program called¬†[Local Guides](). It‚Äôs not a direct way to earn cash, but it opens doors.

Here‚Äôs how it works:

* You contribute to Google Maps by adding reviews, photos, missing places, and edits.
* You earn points and badges. As you rank up, you can get early access to Google products, invites to events, and even free perks.

More importantly, this builds your credibility. I‚Äôve seen freelancers use this to show proof of their mapping skills when pitching to clients.

You can also list yourself on sites like:

* [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/)
* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/)
* [PeoplePerHour](https://www.peopleperhour.com/)

and offer ‚Äú[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†Maps Optimization‚Äù or ‚ÄúLocal¬†[SEO](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†Setup‚Äù services.

# 3.¬†Affiliate Marketing Using Google Maps

This method takes more time to build but can bring in passive income.

Here‚Äôs a simplified version:

* Use Google Maps to find tourist spots, hotels, or restaurants in popular locations.
* Write a blog post or create a YouTube video reviewing them.[](https://systeme.io/?sa=sa0036022176932279ade69fe2023d810d1f3ff284)
* Add affiliate links to booking sites (like¬†[Booking.com]()¬†or¬†[TripAdvisor]()).
* When someone clicks and books through your link, you earn a commission.

This works well for travel bloggers, but you can also do this for local service reviews‚Äîespecially if you niche down (for example: ‚ÄúBest vegan cafes in Austin‚Äù or ‚ÄúTop-rated pet groomers in LA‚Äù).

It takes time, but once your content ranks, you earn money without doing much after.

# 4.¬†Create Listicles or Maps for Content Creators or Local Media

Many YouTubers, influencers, or local news sites need location-based info‚Äîthings like:

* ‚ÄúTop 10 BBQ spots in Memphis‚Äù
* ‚ÄúHidden hiking trails in Seattle‚Äù
* ‚ÄúBest tattoo studios in New Jersey‚Äù

You can build these lists using¬†[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†Maps, organize them in¬†[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†Docs or Canva, and pitch them as content packages.

You can also use free tools like:

* **Google My Maps**¬†to create shareable custom maps
* **Canva**¬†for visual layouts
* **Notion**¬†for organized digital guides

Then sell these as¬†[digital](https://tchelete.com/effective-digital-marketing-strategy/)¬†products or offer them as a service to bloggers or travel influencers.

# 5.¬†Add Missing Places and Get Paid by Companies

Some companies and apps pay people to improve map data. They need you to:

* Add missing roads
* Verify businesses
* Take geo-tagged photos

Apps like¬†[MapRoulette](https://maproulette.org/),¬†[StreetComplete](https://github.com/streetcomplete/StreetComplete), and¬†[TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/)¬†sometimes have tasks related to maps or location info.

The pay varies, but it‚Äôs another way to earn money with mapping skills‚Äîespecially if you enjoy walking or exploring.

# 6.¬†Use Google Maps to Source Leads for Other Freelance Gigs

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre a web designer, content writer, or¬†[social media](https://tchelete.com/best-social-media-marketing-tools-you-should-know/)¬†manager.

You can use¬†[Google](https://tchelete.com/how-to-do-seo/)¬†Maps to find businesses with:

* No website
* Low-quality photos
* Bad reviews
* No social media links

Then reach out with a personalized message. Something like:

Many freelancers use this method to get local clients‚Äîit‚Äôs free and often leads to long-term work.

1m4tv6d,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1m4tv6d/could_hamilton_beach_one_press_drip_coffee_maker/,Could Hamilton Beach One Press Drip Coffee Maker Review Transform Your Morning Brew?,"Hamilton Beach 48465 One Press Programmable Drip Coffee Maker has been a regular feature in my kitchen for the past month, and I‚Äôve given it a real workout to see if it lives up to the hype. The promise of no more scorched coffee or broken carafes immediately caught my attention. I approach every morning armed with a mug and a sleepy face, ready to face the coffee beast. Here‚Äôs how it performed.

**Convenience of Carafe-Free Dispensing**  
The absence of a carafe is perhaps the coffee maker's most obvious and defining feature. This concept instantly appealed to me. I'm a serial klutz in the morning, and carafes are pretty much adult glassware grenades in my clumsy hands. This machine solves that problem with its internal tank, dispensing coffee straight into my mug at the press of a bar. It‚Äôs like having a coffee fountain at your disposal. Without a carafe, there‚Äôs less risk of spills or those nasty baked-on coffee stains, which used to drive me up the wall.  

[Find the best price for Hamilton Beach 48465 on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b001r4lk1q/)

**Heat Retention That Delivers**  
The internal warming heater is another standout feature. Unlike traditional systems where coffee sits on a hot plate, risking the flavor turning acidic, this machine keeps the brew consistently warm and fresh for up to four hours. On days when I had an early start but needed a second or even third cup after midday meetings, it still tasted freshly brewed. No scorched or burned notes, just the smooth flavor that I expect from a good coffee maker.

**One-Handed Operation for On-the-Go Mornings**  
My weekday routine involves dashing out of the house with a travel mug in hand. This machine accommodates my usual chaos with ease. The dispensing bar lets me quickly fill up a 7"" travel mug, and since it‚Äôs a one-handed operation, I can hold my bag or shuffle through emails simultaneously. It‚Äôs little features like this that make it perfect for busy lifestyles.

**Customizable Brew Settings**  
When it comes to choice, this coffee maker shines. Whether I‚Äôm in the mood for a strong, bold brew to power through a busy morning or a lighter option for an afternoon pick-me-up, the programmable strength selector has me covered. With four brewing options‚Äîbold, regular, 1-4 cup, and iced coffee‚Äîit feels like I have a mini barista in my kitchen. And hats off to the timer; waking up to the smell of coffee brewing has never been easier. I usually set it the night before, and it‚Äôs like my kitchen is alive with caffeine-fueled magic when I step in groggily at 6 AM.

**Keeping Things Clean Made Easy**  
There‚Äôs a reason why most of my past coffee machines retired earlier than expected‚Äîthey were a nightmare to clean. But with this one, I‚Äôve barely had to grumble. The removable internal tank and brew basket make it ridiculously easy to rinse them out. Plus, the thoughtful display on the digital screen gives timely reminders when it‚Äôs time to clean the unit. I never have to question if buildup is sabotaging my brew flavor.

**Benefits**  
- Simplifies mornings with carafe-free dispensing.  
- Prevents flavor degradation with its internal heater.  
- Multiple brewing options to suit personal preferences.  

**Hurdles**  
- Filling the water reservoir can be a bit awkward since it‚Äôs not as straightforward as pouring directly into a visible container.  
- The machine is a bit bulky, so it might not suit compact kitchens.  
- A reusable filter would have been a thoughtful inclusion, as disposable paper filters can add up.  

**Peer Products**  
I did a little comparison shopping among other coffee makers before settling on this one. Competitors like the Cuisinart DCC-1200 or the Ninja CE251 came close in terms of features. The Cuisinart offers a similar programmable setup, but it uses a traditional carafe, which introduces the risk of spills. The Ninja, on the other hand, tries to strike a balance between style and functionality but falls short when it comes to retaining heat. What sets the Hamilton Beach model apart is its unique dispensing system and a clear focus on maintaining coffee freshness for longer periods. Among these, it really feels tailored for people who value convenience and freshly brewed quality.  

**Value Assessment**  
Considering the functionality and features packed into this coffee maker, it strikes a solid balance between affordability and quality. For someone like me, who relies on coffee to kick-start my day, the customization options and reliable brew quality justify the price point. It delivers a great experience without feeling like you‚Äôre paying for unnecessary frills.

1m4tuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenya/comments/1m4tuse/ladies_homes_part_1/,Ladies' Homes Part 1.,"Long.ish read. It's usually very surprising to find cockroaches the homes of some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. I kid you not, I'm being 100% 
This one time I was out with some friends (both male and female) one of my friends brought a friend of hers, a fly chic. (I'm talking super fly)and we hit it off immediately. I'm like OK, this is going swimmingly. At the end of the night, kitu 4 AM we're both like, ""What's the plan?"" We settle for her place, and I'm excited cause I was working for a while and it had been a minute since I felt a woman's warmth. We head there, nice building, nice looking apartment, until she cuts the lights on.

Roaches run to hide. I'm talking like 10, the small kind. The house is dirty, dusty, filthy.... looks like it hasn't been cleaned in over a week, and beside the couch there's a dirty shirt, and a  gstring I believe also was dirty. 

Now, I believe the home is the seat of someone's identity, and state of being. I'm not talking about the neighbourhood its in, or what's inside it, but how it's treated. I have a great apartment, in a regular ass neighbourhood, and it's clean, most of the time, with not a single roach in sight. Ever. That's just me. 

Maybe she notices my discomfort (I'd started sneezing because of the dust) she starts tidying up, then runs to the kitchen - of course her sink is full of dirty dishes which she starts washing. I ask her what she's doing, and she goes, ""Just tidying up kidogo."" I say OK, but in my head I'm thinking if she was OK living like that what was she acting about? At this point I'd lost interest, but there was no cabs around her place, so I was gonna thug it out until later in the morning when I could bounce. I told her I was gonna take the couch and we could catch up later. (Nothing was happening that night, not there.)

She was cool with that. 

I tried to sleep but there was a mouse screaming on a glue trap she'd placed, (She didn't even get up, because either she's used to it, or she's a deep sleeper.) I had to mercy kill the poor creature, after which I put on my shoes and left. That was the last time I ever thought about sleeping with someone I just met. 

A neighbour, in the same building as mine, drop dead gorgeous and she knows it, has generations of cockroaches in her house, which smells kind of funny. A roach crawled up my foot as I sat on her couch. Right as another one ran across her coffee table. Those ones are confident. She's got dirty dishes in the sink all the time,  and there always seems to be half bitten bread or chapo drying on the table, and something sticky on the floors or walls. But wait till you hear about the standards she has for the men she meets. 

These two cases are just examples.

Point is: I don't care how you look out here if your place is a pig sty. Priorities my people. ",6,1753030466.0,Kenya,5,1.0,False

1m4tj6h,https://i.redd.it/seoa3ysa52ef1.gif,A complex analysis of my favorite aura of all time: Dreamscape!,"This aura is my absolute favorite aura ever, wver since i laid eyes on it for the first time i knew i had to get it no matter what, even if it took me a year i would hibernate on Limbo 24/7 until i get it and it's what i've been doing.

That being said i definitely want to go over everything that this aura has and what makes it my favorite, so i hope you're ready cause this is gonna be long:


Concept:

I think the concept is the most important part when it comes to why i like the aura so much.

This aura clearly represents DreamCore which is a concept i really love and have been enjoying ever since the backrooms became one of the cultures on the internet, from the songs to the images from said style it has always captivated me how something so liminal can be both comforting and terrifying at the same time, i wanna be there and live it but i also wanna run away from it... It's amuzing how our brain works.
This is definitely the main reason why i love the aura and, as someone who was waiting for some Dreamcore/Weirdcore auras i feel more than satisfied and my expectations were blown out of the water.

The song:

I seriously hope that in the future Kvbii keeps making more compositions for auras like thse cause omfg this song is so well made and it represents the dreamcore sound style so well it's actually impressive.

When it comes to the song there are many complex intricacies lying trough this melody:

The main melody is accompanied by sweet and calming notes that give you the comfort and make you feel safe just like in a dream.

The constant melody that plays in the background backing up the main jingle activates something in your brain that helps you rest and feel calm.

The bass note that plays each compass helps you keeping aware of the rythm present in the music without any beats that would ruin the calmness and serenity of the song.

And OMFG the humming from the backrooms level 0' lights troughout the whole song fits so well and it's fucking peak sound design, 10/10 composition.

Appearance:

Omfg i could not have asked for something better, it get goosebumps just thinking about how weirdcore auras will be once they introduce them, i serioudly hope the 1B+ is a weirdcore aura with backrooms levels appearing like a slideshow but the transition is rythmical trough glitches.

The white light coming from above give me peace of mind and it's perfect to contrast the other Limbo auras helping the aura stand out.

The white glows that appear trough the sides not only helps the aura have a special look to it but also makes me think of the snowy days when i used to go on vacation as a kid, it just goes so well with the luminous parts of the aura making you feel like that, altought the Limbo might be scary this aura keeps you from being harmed by it.

The road signs make a very good job at representing the liminality in the aura, road signs are something we pass trough many times in our lives when we leave our house, go for a drive or even go on vacation, this helps with the familiarity and liminality that is present in dreamcore and dreams in general, once again giving you comfort.

The road lamps also make you feel like you're driving trough the street during midnight on a snowy day just chilling and looking for a gas station to buy something to eat and some hot cocoa or coffee to drink, it makes me relaxed

The avatar floating in the air is something i always love in auras and i'm very happy it's here as a space lover 0 gravity avatar animations on auras always make me so amuzed. In this aura however it feels more like a resting type of flight, one that represents the moment you're laying in bed just resting after a long day, it's warm.


What it means to me:

Seeing this aura reduces my anxiety, it helps me keep calm and relaxes whenever i see a gif of it or even someone using it.

It's super clean and super beautiful and it captivates me every moment, my current objective in sol's and i honestly don't think it can be surpassed unless they relase a full backrooms aura, maybe of level Fun, Level 94 and level 0 combined.

But yeah this is just my analysis on the aura, i fucking love it, unfortunately my luck in limbo has been horrible with me getting only 2 cores per day troughout 24 hours.

I'll keep trying tho, i will not rest until i get it, i swear that!

This has been my life for the last 1.5 years. I 25F was in a relationship with a man 30M for four years. Since the first time I had met him I knew he was very sarcastic and always brutally honest. That was what initially drew me in and I loved that about him. But we had problems from the very beginning, he would point out things that I would do ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or things that I could improve on. Some examples would be he would tell me to not make him coffee in the morning or if i would cook for him he would examine it and make faces at it like it was poisoned or something, one time he even pointed out that my body was getting a little fat (I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù and 120 lbs). Now these examples may seem small (except the body shaming one) but i am an acts of service girly and it is one of my loves and passions to cook/feed people and take care of them. He was also an acts of service man. He would tell me he is very particular about how he likes his coffee which is totally fine but i would ask ‚Äúhey can you show me how you make it so i can also make the coffee how you like it?‚Äù His response would be ‚Äúno i already showed you. You should have listened‚Äù. With the food, i would ask him ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong‚Äù And he‚Äôd go ‚Äúoh nothing.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou know i don‚Äôt eat this much food.‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not making a face‚Ä¶?‚Äù As he‚Äôs picking up the food with his fingers and sarcastically examining it‚Ä¶ Being an acts of service girl this BOTHERED me so much and hurt my feelings and i know i am a great cook. During the relationship i had brought this up so many times and he would always respond with an excuse or say that that was not what he was doing (gaslighting me).

For the four years we were together he had never complimented me (my outfits, my makeup, my cooking, anything i would do) and if he did it was so rare and it would actually stop me in my tracks and stun me. That‚Äôs not how it should be and i know that now. He would also accuse me of cheating quite a lot. I chalked this up to him having been cheated on in all of his previous relationships and also his mother cheating on his dad. I had never cheated. He would say things like ‚Äúyou put on makeup to go to work but you never but on makeup for when we hangout. There must be some guy at work‚Äù.

I finally called it quits over a year ago and shit got scary. He would text me nonstop asking to talk and work things out. He lived almost 1.5 hours away from me and would show up at my house uninvited to try to talk to me. He would come to my place around 8pm knowing that i get off work and I‚Äôm usually home by that time so when i would come home from work i would see his car there. We would have the same conversation over and over and i told him he cannot be doing this and he needs to leave. I would get hand written notes say things like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt understand, i love you, i don‚Äôt know why you are doing this to me‚Äù left on my door step (not mailed just folded up). I would get multiple packages of my things that he still had of mine (again not mailed..) left on my doorstep. I‚Äôd get bouquets of flowers from this flower company near me for months after we had broken up.

I was seeing someone 4 months after we had broken up and i remember being with this new guy( I‚Äôll call him Q) and watching the delivery van pull up to my place and both of us watching the delivery man walking up with this huge bouquet and Q go ‚Äúno way that‚Äôs from him‚Ä¶‚Äù SURE WAS! He ended up tossing them out for me. This one incident was 6 months post break up with my ex.

Getting so many harassing text messages accusing me of ruining things then asking to get back together and apologizing saying he loved me and missed me and then saying good luck with the guy i was cheating on him with i finally blocked his number after getting a message saying ‚Äúi hope you get the punishment you deserve‚Äù. I had his number blocked prior to getting back out there in the dating scene.

One day i was supposed to be heading over to Qs place and i got a knock on my door, i got up from my couch and saw through the peephole it was my ex! He kept knocking for 10 minutes and i was not trying to answer that door, we were past done and at that point I‚Äôve had enough of him showing up and gifts showing up and it was getting scary. I closed my blinds and started to get ready to go to Qs thinking my ex would give up and leave. Nope.. i ended up calling my friend and asking her to stay on the phone with me since it was starting to really freak me out. While on the call i unblocked his number to message him ‚Äúyou need to leave‚Äù. He got off my porch but i could see through my window that he was now just sitting in his car outside. I messaged again saying ‚Äúno you need to go home. Please stop showing up at my place‚Äù. He finally left and i hung up with my friend and raced over to Qs and told him what happened.

For a year things would show up, flowers would show up. I had made it clear that i didn‚Äôt want to be contacted by him and to stop sending things and showing up. One scary aspect was that he worked for CPS and since his number was blocked on my phone, i started to get called from his work phone‚Ä¶.. that was NOT okay.

The last time i heard from him was around Valentine‚Äôs Day (over a year post breakup) with him reaching out to me with multiple social media accounts, new accounts made after i blocked the previous one to try to reach out. He also did the same thing to my mother. I told her to block the account when he first messaged her, but then she got another request from a new account that had said ‚Äúhe was sorry how he treated her daughter and that i was the girl he wanted to marry‚Ä¶ect‚Äù. My mom is freaked out and so are my siblings!

This all got to be too much i debating going to the police and filing a report. I had reached out actually to my ex‚Äôs mom and sent her screenshots of the mean messages that he had sent me ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm at a loss and i don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. He has been showing up uninvited and has been harassing me‚Äù pretty much asking her to go get her son‚Ä¶and she told me she didn‚Äôt even know we had broken up‚Ä¶

Now it‚Äôs been over a year and a half and i thought it was over being the last time i got any messages or flowers was in February. I thought it had stopped so i didn‚Äôt file a report and also nothing was a direct threat. But then last week i got another bouquet saying something like ‚Äúi still think about you‚Äù. Im pretty sure i saw him drive past me the other day, same car, sunglasses, looked like him and this person looked right at me. It was so quick i thought maybe it was just my paranoia.

I told my therapist/ friends about this and now im thinking i really should file. I kept all the messages/ notes/ cards and even the engagement ring he had tried giving me which i returned but then got back in the ‚Äúmail‚Äù. I‚Äôve been told i should move as well since this is scary behavior and god knows what he can do. He has his concealed carry (so do i) so that is also in the back of my mind with everything.

1m4tax0,https://www.reddit.com/r/husky/comments/1m4tax0/advice_on_destructive_behavior/,Advice on destructive behavior,"Hi! I‚Äôve found myself in a situation where I‚Äôm trying to help rehome a husky that isn‚Äôt mine. Someone I know is rehoming his 1 year 9 month old husky bc of destructive behavior while he‚Äôs away. He‚Äôs ripped up 3 couches, a rug, and I think smaller things. It seems extreme and costly. This does not happen when his owner is at home but it DOES still happen both when the dog is left alone with other dogs and left fully alone. It only happens while the owner is not physically in the house - he has to go into the office M-F. 

We did a trial week with this dog and while we absolutely loved him, we are moving in 5 days and then traveling for several weeks. It‚Äôs not a good time to add a second dog to our household who needs more significant training / exercise / support and the owner is looking to surrender the dog to a shelter asap. It breaks my heart because I do think we could give him a really great home once we‚Äôre more settled in a few months - I wfh, run 20-30 miles per week, we hike a lot, and we are generally homebodies and when we do go out it‚Äôs usually a dog-friendly brewery. But his owner is expressing he‚Äôs at his breaking point and seems anxious to rehome /surrender him in the next few days. 

The owner has told us that he does not do well in crates and supposes this is because he may have been mistreated before he adopted him. He was at a k*** shelter before he adopted him and was 2 days away from being e********d because he was not doing well being crated at the shelter. When his owner tried crating him he would get anxious and go to the bathroom in the crate. However it does not seem like he‚Äôs tried bringing in a trainer or behaviorist and we know with certainty that he has not tried medication to assist in the early days of crate training (or in general when he leaves the dog alone).

He was at the shelter for 3 months, owner has had him for 3-5 months we think, and his history prior to the shelter is unknown. 

When we did our trial week he was perfect but we did not leave him alone at home for more than 5 minutes (although he would be alone for longer periods in a separate room with our dog and he was fine then) and we also took him for much more exercise. His owner walks him for 30 min in the AM and PM and takes him to the dog park several times per week. We did 3 30-45 min walks plus a 3-5 mile run each day, he was probably getting in 7-10 miles per day and some more stimulation sitting with us at coffee shops / breweries. Plus he had access to our backyard although he spent way less time out there than our dog. He seemed to improve (less pacing, more napping) as the days went by and we  don‚Äôt know if this is because he was just getting more comfortable with our home, the exercise was helping, or both. 

Based on this detail do y‚Äôall think this could be a separation anxiety issue in addition to understimulation/underexercise? Any tips of this from other husky owners?

We felt hopeful seeing how he responded to the exercise and I think this is a huge piece of the puzzle. But in terms of trying and help him find another home I‚Äôm wondering how much we should emphasize the major unaddressed gap of potential separation anxiety not being addressed with a trainer. Or even in terms of us possibly long-term fostering him once we‚Äôre back next month; my husband and I would feel a lot better about that if we had some amount of hope that we could get him to a point where he has a positive association with the crate*. It seems like with very patient training with a professional you can re associate the crate to be a positive thing even with dogs who seem to have a strong fear response to it initially. And I think if he could get to a point of being crate trained, that would open a ton more doors for him. 

(*We‚Äôd never be leaving him in the crate for long periods at a time - I‚Äôm thinking of this as an initial insurance option for when we need to go the grocery store, gym, dinner with friends etc. We very very rarely leave our current dog at home for longer than 3 hours at a time.) 

No other behavioral issues other than this. He is very derpy, secure, and playful with other humans and dogs. He does not seem anxious when he‚Äôs around us. He seems to just wants to be around people (Velcro dog for the most part) and needs a great deal of stimulation (he‚Äôs endlessly curious, he‚Äôs a husky).

The temperature of your brew makes a huge difference in taste and satisfaction. After extensive testing, I've found that Keurig machines, particularly their K-Supreme Plus models, consistently deliver some of the hottest coffee.

I've measured temperatures right after brewing, and these machines hit around 192¬∞F (89¬∞C), which is right in the sweet spot for optimal coffee extraction. You can check out the current prices and models here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

But temperature isn't just about personal preference - it actually affects how your coffee tastes. When water is too cool, you get under-extracted coffee that tastes weak and sour. Too hot, and it becomes bitter. The ideal brewing temperature is between 195-205¬∞F.

Here's what I've discovered about different coffee makers and their brewing temperatures:

- Keurig K-Supreme Plus: 192¬∞F
- Technivorm Moccamaster: 196¬∞F
- Bunn Velocity Brew: 195¬∞F
- Ninja Hot and Cold: 190¬∞F
- Standard Mr. Coffee: 180¬∞F

One thing I really appreciate about newer Keurig models is their temperature control feature. You can actually adjust how hot you want your coffee, which is perfect because not everyone likes their coffee scorching hot.

I remember when I first switched to a Keurig with temperature control - it was a game-changer. No more waiting for my coffee to cool down or dealing with lukewarm brews. If you're interested in exploring these features, you can find detailed specifications here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

Some tips I've learned for maintaining hot coffee temperature:

1. Preheat your mug with hot water
2. Clean your machine regularly
3. Use the right amount of water
4. Don't let brewed coffee sit in the carafe too long
5. Consider using a thermal mug

The coffee maker you choose really does make a difference in your daily coffee experience. After trying various brands and models, I've found that investing in a quality machine that maintains proper brewing temperature is worth every penny.

For those wondering about energy efficiency - most modern coffee makers, including Keurig's newer models, have auto-off features and energy-saving modes that help balance hot coffee with reasonable power consumption.

Remember, the best temperature for you might not be the absolute hottest. It's about finding that sweet spot where the coffee is hot enough to extract maximum flavor but not so hot that it burns your tongue or turns bitter.",1,1753029145.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

Sheriff Clayton Lock rubbed the sleep from his eyes as he stared at the blinking red light on his office phone. Four messages. All left before sunrise. That alone was enough to put a weight in his gut.

The dispatcher, Carla, leaned through the open doorway with a fresh cup of coffee. ‚ÄúThird one came in around five. Wilson‚Äôs boy found two goats torn up behind their barn. Said it looked like something out of a damn horror movie.‚Äù

Lock took the cup, nodded his thanks, and muttered, ‚ÄúThat makes three this week.‚Äù

‚ÄúFour,‚Äù Carla corrected. ‚ÄúOld man Rudd called after you left yesterday. Found his chicken coop busted open. Said he thought it was kids until he saw the chickens. Said there was almost no blood. It looked like the ground ‚Äòdrank it.‚Äô Barely a drop of it anywhere.‚Äù

Lock sighed and dropped into his creaking chair. He‚Äôd been sheriff of Gray Haven for sixteen years. Long enough to know when something wasn‚Äôt right.

Coyotes were one thing. They came and went, usually after trash or livestock. But they didn‚Äôt do this. Not the way it was being described‚Äîripped flesh, no blood, faces chewed off, entrails exposed like someone had performed a damn ritual.

He reached for the call log and jotted down addresses.

Wilson Farm, Red Branch Rd.

Sutton Place, Off Old hundred Rd.

Rudd Property, Pine Sink Trail
And then, without writing it down, he added another in his head: Hensley‚Äôs Cabin.

Robert Hensley hadn‚Äôt called anything in‚Äîbut Lock hadn‚Äôt expected him to. That old bastard would bury a body with his bare hands before picking up a phone. Still, the location fit. Out toward the ridges, right where the woods got thick. Something was working its way through the forest.

Lock stood, grabbed his hat, and slung on his duty belt around his waist. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll head out. Might swing by Hensley‚Äôs on the way. Just to check.‚Äù

Carla raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúThink he‚Äôs mixed up in this somehow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. But he knows the land better than anyone. If there‚Äôs something out there, he‚Äôs probably already seen it.‚Äù

Carla hesitated, then lowered her voice. ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs a cat? Like a mountain lion? Or maybe a black bear? Coyotes again?‚Äù

Lock paused in the doorway. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. But whatever it is‚Ä¶ it ain‚Äôt hunting to eat.‚Äù

And outside the sheriff‚Äôs office, the day broke wide and quiet, like the woods were holding their breath.

Chapter 5

The morning came slow, blanketed in fog that clung to the hollows like breath on glass. Jessie zipped her jacket and loaded the last of her gear into the bed of the truck‚Äîtrail cams, motion sensors, scent markers, and a notebook worn soft at the edges.

The tech wasn‚Äôt cutting-edge, not in ‚Äô94, but it worked well enough. The trail cams recorded onto VHS cartridges no longer than a deck of cards, with motion-triggered infrared flashes that could catch a raccoon mid-sprint. Most of her research at grad school had been built around this gear‚Äîprimitive by future standards, but field-tested and sturdy.

Robert watched from the porch, a thermos in hand. ‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want a guide?‚Äù
Jessie smirked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be fine, Dad. I‚Äôm trained for this.‚Äù

‚ÄúStill,‚Äù he said, his voice gravelly with sleep, ‚Äúthe woods out here got more twists than you remember.‚Äù

She gave him a nod and a small smile before climbing into the truck.

The old logging road wound like a scar through the trees, and she followed it deep into the preserve, miles from the cabin. 

Birds scattered from the treetops as the truck rumbled over rocks and mud. When the road finally narrowed too much, she parked beneath a grove of birches and set out on foot.

The forest here was older. Denser. The trees leaned over each other like conspirators. Jessie moved carefully, marking her route with bright orange ribbon. She stopped every few hundred yards to mount a trail cam, angling it toward well-worn game trails or watering spots.

Near a moss-choked creekbed, she found her first real sign.
A print.

Large. Deep. Four toes‚Äîclawed. At first glance, it looked feline, but the size gave her pause. Too big for a bobcat. Too heavy for a mountain lion. And the stride was odd, like whatever made it had a lopsided stride. There was a second print nearby, but it was smeared‚Äîlike it had dragged a foot or stumbled.

She crouched beside it, brushing away loose leaves. The mud beneath was torn like something heavy had kicked off suddenly.
Jessie took a Polaroid and jotted down coordinates in her notebook.

A few yards farther, she found a tree trunk scratched high‚Äîhigher than she could reach with her arm fully extended. The bark was torn in long, curved gouges. Not straight like a bear. Not the kind of sharpening marks a cat made either.
Whatever it was, it was big. And possibly nearby.

The hairs on her arms prickled.
She exhaled and reminded herself she was a scientist. The woods were full of mystery‚Äîold predators, strays, escaped exotics, even feral dogs could leave behind strange signs. But still‚Ä¶ This felt different. Off.

By early afternoon, she had five cameras mounted and a mental map of the terrain. Before leaving, she placed a scent lure in a small clearing‚Äîa mix of urine and musky oil meant to draw out apex predators.

As she hiked back to the truck, wind stirred the canopy above. Something shifted behind the trees‚Äîquick, low to the ground. But when she turned, there was only stillness.

She stood there a moment longer, notebook clutched tight, breath caught in her throat.

The underbrush slowly settled, then out popped a small fox. It scurried off after noticing Jessie.

Chapter 6

The axe struck wood with a dull thunk, splitting the log clean. Robert bent to grab another, sweat already forming beneath his shirt despite the morning chill. Chopping firewood helped him think‚Äîor not think. 

Lately, the line between the two was thin.
He‚Äôd watched Jessie‚Äôs truck disappear down the ridge about an hour ago. She was more confident than he remembered. More like Kelly.

He set another log on the stump and raised the axe‚Äîwhen he heard the crunch of tires on gravel.

Robert let the axe drop and turned toward the sound. A dark green cruiser rolled into the clearing, sun flashing off the windshield. It parked beside Jessie‚Äôs truck tracks. A door opened with a squeak.

Sheriff Clayton Lock stepped out.

Same wide shoulders and squared jaw. The years had etched deep lines around his eyes, but Robert would‚Äôve known him anywhere. He hadn‚Äôt changed much, not where it counted.

‚ÄúMorning,‚Äù Lock said, voice tight.

Robert didn‚Äôt answer right away. Just wiped his hands on his jeans and stared.

‚ÄúSomething I can help you with?‚Äù he asked finally.

Lock took off his hat, held it against his chest for a second, then nodded toward the stump. ‚ÄúThere have been a lot of strange reports lately. You saw something.‚Äù

Robert didn‚Äôt flinch. ‚ÄúAnd who told you that?‚Äù

Lock shrugged. ‚ÄúNobody. Just connecting dots. Wilson‚Äôs goats. Rudd‚Äôs chickens. Sutton‚Äôs barn cats. All in a stretch across the edge of these woods.‚Äù

Robert studied him, jaw set. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt report anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Carla told me. Told her if Hensley found a damn body on his front porch, he‚Äôd just bury it and keep drinking.‚Äù

Robert cracked a humorless smile. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not wrong about that.‚Äù

Lock stepped closer. ‚ÄúLook, I‚Äôm not here to argue. I just need to know what you saw.‚Äù

Robert sighed and picked up the axe again. ‚ÄúIt was a deer. Torn up real bad. No blood. Gutted clean. Not the work of any animal I‚Äôve seen.‚Äù

Lock squinted. ‚ÄúNo blood?‚Äù

Robert nodded. ‚ÄúThe body was dry. Like it‚Äôd been drained.‚Äù

Lock muttered a curse under his breath. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what Rudd said. Like the ground drank it.‚Äù

A silence stretched between them.

Finally, Lock added, ‚ÄúYou think it‚Äôs rabies again?‚Äù

That stopped Robert cold. His grip tightened on the axe handle.

‚ÄúYou want to talk about rabies?‚Äù he said, voice low.

Lock shifted his weight. ‚ÄúRobert‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. You listen to me.‚Äù Robert turned to face him fully. ‚ÄúSixteen years ago, I told you there was something wrong with those coyotes. I told you they were sick. Acting strange. And what‚Äôd you say?‚Äù

Lock‚Äôs jaw clenched. ‚ÄúThat there wasn‚Äôt enough evidence to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said I was just spooked. Overreacting. That I needed to let you do your job.‚Äù Robert added.

The air between them crackled.

‚ÄúShe died two days later,‚Äù Robert said, voice like stone. ‚ÄúYou remember that? You remember digging what was left of her out that den by Stillwater Run?‚Äù

Lock‚Äôs face hardened. ‚ÄúI remember.‚Äù

Robert looked away, the rage cooling into something heavier.

‚ÄúI never blamed the animals,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúThey were just doing what they do. But you? You were supposed to know better. She died because of you!‚Äù

Lock looked like he wanted to say something. Maybe an apology. But it stuck behind his teeth.

Finally, he said, ‚ÄúWhatever this is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs worse than last time. I‚Äôve been in this job long enough to know when something‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôve learned from my mistakes, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here,‚Äù Lock said. ‚ÄúAnd Gray Haven feels‚Ä¶ off. Like something old‚Äôs been stirred up.‚Äù

Robert didn‚Äôt respond. Just looked out toward the woods, where the trees whispered and the shadows ran deeper than they should‚Äôve.

‚ÄúYou still know these woods better than anyone,‚Äù Lock said. ‚ÄúIf you see anything‚Äîanything‚Äîyou call me. No more burying things in the dirt.‚Äù

Robert nodded slowly. ‚ÄúIf I see something worth talking about‚Ä¶ you‚Äôll know.‚Äù

Lock put his hat back on and walked to the cruiser.

As he drove away, Robert turned back to the woodpile, lifted the axe‚Äîand paused.

A smear of muddy tracks ran along the edge of the clearing. Large. Deep.

He stared at them a long time before setting the axe down.

\-Third thing, the pics I keep in my profile are my average one's I keep the really good one's in my phone because while I believe that looks matter, one should check for emotional compatibility as well. Hence the reason why I keep average photos for my profile and keep the really good one's in my phone.

Imagine this usual scenario......you ever see posts/reels in Instagram/TikTok and wonder when do I get someone who's sweet, caring, possibly confident(definitely haha) and a guy who will be honest if the situation comes up?

I have lot planned in life, financial wise, I pretty much figured out my life and intellectually I feel like I'm smart enough to overcome situations, whereas both of them are good for me, I also want some unpredictability, some fun and someone whom I can call whenever I want, play any kind of game I want(planning to buy PS5, a laptop guy now) and honestly....wake up but still pretend to fall asleep for a few mins so that I can snuggle with you.

I like to watch sports, anime and Hollywood moves and K-dramas so that I can practice my rizz on you hehe(so dumb!)

I like brainy stuff such as stargazing and physical ones such as paragliding, surfing and many more!

But recently I tried Buldak (spicy noodles) and it‚Äôs actually so good!! I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like it, but I really do. I usually eat it around noon, and it‚Äôs been kind of perfect. Plus, it‚Äôs high in calories which helps a lot since I don‚Äôt eat much otherwise.

The pink carbonara flavor is my favorite right now‚Äîsuper tasty :)

Just wanted to share in case anyone else is going through something similar.",45,1753028758.0,InstantRamen,10,0.97,False

There‚Äôs this faculty member (about 28‚ÄØM) who would talk to me about my trips to America (apparently it‚Äôs considered cool ), joke around, and even say my name in the preclinic when passing by. That was three years ago, and he was already following me on Instagram.

Last month he replied to my story. We briefly talked about one of my patients, and I mentioned something rude that was said to me. He asked who said it; I said I couldn‚Äôt share it via text, only in person. Then he said, ‚ÄúOh, then we should grab a coffee together,‚Äù All I said was sure and he suggested somewhere close to the school 

That was over a month ago. Then last night at 3‚ÄØa.m., he texted me asking if I was around. I replied about 15‚ÄØhours later with ‚Äúkinda.‚Äù He then followed up saying, ‚ÄúWe had a thing planned, that‚Äôs why I asked.‚Äù

Meanwhile, I‚Äôm talking to someone from the USA who‚Äôs visiting me in a couple of months. I want to stay loyal to him. Besides, this is not ethical at all and I feel uncomfortable. But I don‚Äôt know how to reject the invitation gracefully since I‚Äôll still see him at the clinics all year.

Just the other day, I faced what could only be described as a near-death experience; almost sentenced to the recycling bin by a zealous houseguest who mistook my chipped handle for a fatal flaw.

Yet, what is a flaw but a mere mark of a life well-lived? Of countless mornings filled with the soothing aroma of freshly brewed java, of accompanying sleepy owners in quiet contemplation.

How close I came to being melted down, transformed into something unrecognizable. Perhaps a glass bottle or even a tile! But here I remain, perched with dignity, grateful for the reprieve. It is in these moments, teetering on the edge of oblivion, that we truly ponder: what does it mean to endure, to carry the stories of caffeinated conversations past?

Oh, the things I've seen, the cream spills I've endured. Still, I marvel at the the universe, and its strangely haphazard sense of humor. Such is the life of a distinguished coffee companion. Such is life itself.",7,1753028490.0,InanimateChatterbox,0,0.9,False

One blink. I was leaning back on the creaky porch swing, lukewarm coffee beside me. The Milky Way blazed overhead, thick and familiar. The next blink‚Ä¶ gone.¬†

Then the world went out.

As if the sky had been yanked from its moorings, erased in an instant.

A slick, unnatural cold slid down my spine, deeper than any well water, wrong in a way I couldn‚Äôt name.The porch swing shrieked beneath me, its rusty protest slicing through the silence.

Desperation clawed at my throat as I scanned the heavens above the restless cornfields, my eyes straining against the impossible void.

Sirius, Vega, the countless pinpricks of distant suns ‚Äì all were simply *gone*, erased with terrifying finality.

My fingers fumbled for the phone in my pocket, finding only cold, inert plastic devoid of even the ghostly glow of a dead battery.¬†

Time lost meaning in that oppressive blackness. I paced the weathered porch boards, each groan and sigh of the ancient wood beneath my boots echoing like the deliberate step of something colossal and unseen drawing nearer.

I sank onto the cold wooden steps, shivering uncontrollably despite the lingering warmth of the night air, my gaze locked helplessly on the abyss where creation had once burned.

Then, deep within that eternal midnight, moments before the false promise of dawn should have stained the horizon, the void itself *deepened*. A vast, jagged blotch of pure, ravenous negation tore across the zenith, an irregular wound in the fabric of reality darker than the surrounding emptiness.¬†

My breath seized in my chest, ice crystallizing in my veins.¬†

Immeasurable.¬†

Hungry.¬†

It descended without sound, an avalanche of purest dark sliding down the curve of the sky, expanding until it devoured half the visible heavens. A bone-deep understanding, horrifying and absolute, crystallized: the stars hadn‚Äôt been obscured. They had been *consumed*.¬†

It halted directly overhead.

Then, as silently as it arrived, it lifted. The crushing pressure eased like a mountain range shifting off my lungs, leaving me gasping. The skull-drone faded to a sick, bone-deep throb.¬†

I collapsed against the porch railing, retching violently, bitter bile scorching my throat, my body wracked by tremors that felt like they might shake me apart. Above, the sky remained a lightless wound. The silence returned pressing in like a physical force.

Staring at my trembling hands, pale ghosts in the gloom, I registered the wrongness. My skin looked thin, unnervingly translucent. I raised one shaking hand, peering closer. Beneath the surface: clusters of infinitesimal, perfect points of absolute, light-eating blackness.¬†

It had infested us. The silence shattered not with sound, but with the sickening *sensation* of slow, deliberate movement deep within my marrow.¬†

The stars were gone. And whatever had devoured them was now gestating inside my body, its slow, inevitable awakening a corruption written in the pulsing voids beneath my skin.",9,1753028358.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False
1m4syvi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1m4syvi/six_months_of_therapy_for_my_anxiety_turns_out_my/,"Six months of therapy for my anxiety, turns out my panic attacks might have been from my daily vitamin routine","This is going to sound insane but I need to share because maybe it'll help someone else who's going through the same thing. I've been dealing with random panic attacks and anxiety spikes for about 8 months now. Like, wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing kind of anxiety. My doctor referred me to a therapist and I've been going religiously, doing all the breathing exercises and mindfulness stuff.

The weird thing is that the anxiety didn't really correlate with anything stressful in my life. Some of my worst panic attacks happened on completely normal, good days. My therapist kept asking about caffeine intake, and I don't drink coffee or energy drinks, so we couldn't figure out the trigger.

Last week I was organizing my medicine cabinet and realized I take a LOT of different supplements throughout the day. Morning: multivitamin, vitamin D, B complex. Pre-workout: some random brand I got from Costco. Post-workout: protein powder. Evening: magnesium, melatonin. I never thought about the cumulative effect of all this stuff.

I used the Prove It app to scan everything and was shocked at what I found. My B complex has 8,333% daily value of B6, my pre-workout has 200mg caffeine plus guarana (which is more caffeine), and my multivitamin has synthetic versions of vitamins that can apparently cause jitters in high doses. The app flagged potential interactions between several ingredients.

I've been slowly eliminating things for the past two weeks, and honestly my anxiety has been way more manageable. I feel stupid for not considering this earlier and spending so much money on therapy (though therapy is still helpful for other reasons). But seriously, if you're dealing with unexplained anxiety and take multiple supplements, it might be worth checking for interactions.",54,1753028355.0,Anxiety,11,0.97,False
