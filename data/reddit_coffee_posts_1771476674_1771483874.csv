Then he left the place without paying. After two days me and my frds went for an night show movie while returning the sane cop caught us for riding in triples without helmets but i saved my frds from getting fined by talking to the police saying we met in my working place and he made us go. Again today (19/2/2026) two cops came and had a cold coffee which is worth for around 300. The thing is, why these cops demand free stuffs in cafes and fast food restaurants? And why these managers are also allowing them? What’s the cause?",1,1771483804.0,u_LightFinal7594,0,1.0,False

1r8s5kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1r8s5kj/lengthy_queer_story_my_partner_is_withdrawing/,"Lengthy Queer Story: My partner is withdrawing, minimizing, and avoiding accountability, I finally laid everything out hoping for improvement...","I need outside perspective because I feel like I am watching a pattern unfold in slow motion and my body is starting to react before my mind can rationalize it.

For a while now, I have been living with this push and pull dynamic. Some moments feel hopeful and soft, other moments feel cold and distant in a way that makes me feel like I am intruding just by existing. It has gotten to the point where I started scanning daily interactions for cues, not because I want to police him, but because the emotional temperature changes without warning.
Before the big conversation even happened, there were lots of small moments that built up. We share a home life that should feel intimate and safe, but lately it has felt fragile. There have been days where he is technically present but emotionally absent. No checking in. No warmth. No effort to repair after tension. A lot of silence. There have been moments where he responds to me like I am bothering him, then later acts normal. It leaves me confused and hypervigilant.

Valentine’s Day was a good example of how mixed things are. I (29,M, Arab) came home from work and wanted to go out with him (34,M, White) while it was still light. He took longer than expected, so by the time we left it was dark. I didn’t have a plan then, he suggested a neighborhood (angrily), I agreed. At first it was awkward. He was hangry and not hiding it, you could feel it in how he spoke and moved. Then we found sushi, sat in a cute romantic spot, ordered a Valentine special, and the dinner itself went well. We complimented each other and even had a few cute moments. I took a photo of himself, and asked how come he didnt yet! He said ""oh yeah"" hesitated and did it for the sake of doing it (you know).

 After that, he wanted to check out a new gay bar. On the way there I joked that if we go, I am not going to hide that I am his partner, like I might kiss him on the cheek. He laughed and asked what that means, and when I said a cheek kiss he responded with a flat “oh” in a cold unimpressed way. That small moment stung because it felt like affection with me is complicated and scarce, but his vibe in other contexts can be casual and open. We still went to the bar, sat for a bit, left, and came back, and the night was not a disaster, but it was another moment where I felt the imbalance sharply.

After that, there were also moments that seemed tender. I apologized to him in bed one night and he held my hand. I spooned him a little in the middle of the night. He no longer always turns away from me in bed like before. But then the next day I came home, went into his room the way we normally do, I asked casually “whooo was showering?” and he snapped “not me” in an irritated tone. I asked if he was okay and he said “yeah” shortly and just kept getting ready to leave for the gym without pausing. It is those whiplash shifts that have been wearing me down.

There was also a small moment that showed how he watches but does not always engage. I edited an inside joke into a text and he noticed even though edits don’t notify, he went back, saw it, and reacted with a laughing emoji. That is sweet in a small way, but it also reinforces that he is aware and present enough to notice details, yet he can still choose silence when it comes to emotional intimacy.

The tension kept building until he said out loud that he was considering breaking up (I had to ask if thats what he wants to get it out of him). That is when I stopped trying to hint or gently circle the issue. I put everything on the table, and I passionately spoke it all from a place of genuine care for this human being.

I told him I am not his enemy. I am not attacking him or judging him. I am his teammate. I want what is best for him and for us. But I cannot keep carrying everything alone and pretending it is fine.
I started by taking accountability for my isolation during the beginning of the genocide. Part of it was trauma. I genuinely did not know how to process watching my people suffer while continuing normal life. I witnessed people dying on live, people I had spoken to days before their martyrdom. I connected with queer Palestinians who were being blackmailed for survival. It was too much. I told him I am not designed to absorb that without consequences. He was merely allowing me the space to go through this but wasnt really by my side, engaged and protective, even when he knew I could be in danger due to my involvement in politics.

But I also admitted something else. Part of my isolation was me unconsciously mimicking his love language's level of intensity?. He communicates very little and tends to express love through quiet acts of service. So I pulled back verbally and emotionally while still maintaining reciprocal acts of service. I also intentionally stopped initiating as much because I realized I had been carrying most of the relationship, and it became too much to do that while also surviving the genocide psychologically in the U.S. with little support.

 I hoped that if I stepped back, he would step forward and carry some weight. I now understand that instead of balancing things, it made him feel shut out and pushed him away. That was not my intention. I apologized for the impact and told him I will not do that again now that I understand it, and I reminded him that when I say I won’t repeat something, I mean it.

Then I explained how alone I have felt in the relationship dynamic for a long time. I am usually the initiator. I call restaurants because he avoids communication. I ask to change tables. I plan birthdays. I plan hangouts. I initiate conversations. I initiate sex. I initiate hard discussions about politics. I told him I do not resent being proactive because I love taking care of people and especially him, but I wanted something like that back. I also told him I have adapted because I know he is not a nonchalant jerk, he truly struggles with communication, but adaptation is not the same as being carried.

One of the hardest parts for me to admit was that I can tell when he isn’t being fully honest even when he uses the hand gesture we established early in the relationship to signal seriousness and truth. That gesture was supposed to be an anchor. But over time I started noticing that sometimes the gesture would be there and something in his eyes would not match. The timing would be off. The energy would feel guarded. I would feel hesitation before the words landed. It is not about catching him in a dramatic lie. It is about sensing withholding, minimizing, or smoothing over something he is not ready to say. In those moments I have two options. I can press him and risk pushing him away, or I can accept what he says and carry the weight of knowing there is more underneath. Most of the time I chose to believe him because I did not want to become interrogative or controlling, but over time that gap erodes trust.

I asked him directly about the timeline pattern I have noticed. Around three to four years seems to be when his relationships start to unravel. I did not say it as an accusation. I asked it as pattern recognition. I asked if this is the stage where he starts emotionally withdrawing instead of addressing what needs repair. I asked if his past partners felt the same loneliness around communication. He admitted communication had been an issue before. I told him I am not afraid of hard seasons. I am afraid of unexamined cycles. If there is a pattern, it deserves to be confronted consciously instead of replayed unconsciously. I am not trying to trap him. I think he views commitment as restrictive. I am trying to see if he is willing to break patterns instead of repeat them, because growth at this stage of life has to be intentional if we want something long term.

I also told him about the imbalance that hurts me. I only hear “I love you” back after I say it first, but he seems comfortable leaving “hot,” “sexy,” and fire emojis on other men’s posts. Flirting outward looks easy and abundant, while affection inward feels scarce. That contrast makes me feel unchosen, even if he insists he cares.
I brought up painful moments that were never properly processed because of his avoidance. There was a song he sent me once that felt like one of the rare moments he expressed feelings through lyrics. I told him I have not listened to it more than twice on purpose because I do not want to memorize it. I want to be able to return to it and feel it fresh, like hearing his vulnerability for the first time again. That might sound dramatic, but for me it symbolizes how rare open expression can feel, and how carefully I hold those moments because they are not frequent.
I brought up that his friend Riley (F, 31) sexually assaulted me at the club and bit my ear. I went to get the CCTV footage. I went to the police station and almost filed a report. In therapy I realized part of my urgency was wanting him to react and protect me. Instead he had private conversations with her and her husband without me. I asked him how he thinks that made me feel, especially knowing he can talk to friends about what happened to me, but cannot sit with me and process it directly.

I brought up the breakfast with his friends where we were joking about things our parents say. I shared that my mom calling me her favorite puts pressure on me. He casually said “that’s why you left her.” The table went silent. Even his friends looked uncomfortable. I didn’t make a scene. I texted “wow” under the table because I was too hurt to speak. I cried privately. Later he broke down and apologized deeply, crying on the floor. I forgave him because I saw genuine shame and fear of saying the wrong thing, but the moment stayed with me as proof that communication wounds can happen without him realizing it, and then I am left carrying the injury alone until it finally surfaces.

I reminded him of waking up from nightmares of decapitated children in Gaza, crying in his arms, washing my face, and putting on a suit to attend his friend Julia’s wedding because it mattered to him that I show up. I reminded him of Lady Land, where I waited over three hours for him, he arrived extremely drunk, couldn’t find the entrance, got mad at me, and I ended up taking him home because he could barely stand. On the subway a homeless man almost attacked him, and I froze thinking I might have to physically intervene while he was incapacitated, and I felt helpless and small. We never processed it. I never got a real “I appreciate you, I see what you did, I’m sorry.” It was always a fleeting sorry followed by a redirect to something lighter like coffee or video games.

I brought up Max (his 9 year old nephew who's going to be under his care in the future) because it is not just about us. When Max started saying the N word, he avoided having the conversation. I asked him how he plans to navigate bigger talks when Max becomes a teenager, talks about sex, drugs, racism, bullying, identity. Avoiding hard talks does not make them disappear. It just passes the responsibility elsewhere. I was not attacking him as an uncle. I was pointing out that communication avoidance shows up across his life, not only with me.
I brought up that he wanted sexual experimentation, so I initiated and planned a foursome for us. He attended but did not converse with the people, did not share likes, dislikes, or boundaries, and left it to me to handle. He did not thank me. I brought up that he did not confront our roommate for using his bed for something sexually invasive, the same bed we sleep on, and when I finally confronted her, he said he probably should mention it too.
I brought up two examples that illustrate the same avoidance pattern. When he learned his biological father is alive, I asked if he had thought about reaching out, he said he never thought about it. When I asked if he had considered exploring medical options for his non hearing ear, especially since he loves music and loud spaces overwhelm him and ruin nights out, he said he never thought about it. The issue was not the specific answers. It was the pattern of not thinking about life and growth steps at all. I told him I do not want to force him into anything. My role is to encourage and support. But life cannot be lived entirely in avoidance. Growth requires initiative from within.

I told him I do not need perfection. I need presence. I need to hear “I see you,” “thank you,” and “I am sorry” when it matters. I reminded him he did not check on me when Netanyahu visited our city, even though politics directly impact my identity and family. I told him I started cooking more because he gets hangry, I bought cute containers to pack his meals, and I had to shyly ask him to wash dishes because I cannot cook and clean alone. I rarely hear appreciation. I brought up that his friend Kelly kicked me out and he did not mediate or defend me.

I also told him directly that I am not stupid. I see him texting his friends about our relationship while refraining from talking to me. I told him I reached out to his friends not to manipulate, but because I was desperate to know what is going on in my partner’s mind when he refuses to tell me. I told him I have learned to translate his feelings through behavior and body language because I cannot rely on words, and that is exhausting.

I also confronted the “static” narrative. He says he feels in stasis. I told him gently that the world is not static, life is not static, I am not static, and the relationship is not static. What is static is his internal avoidance, and it is not about the partners, it is about him. If every relationship becomes “stasis” at the same stage, then the common denominator is the pattern, not the person he is with.

He eventually broke down crying. He apologized and said it seems like he shut me out worse than I shut him out. He said “you kept trying and trying and I gave you nothing back.” I stopped him and told him that is not true. He did give things, he married me, he has shown up politically, he has confronted family at times, and I do see him trying, which is why I still believe he is capable of growth. But I told him I cannot carry this alone, it has to come from him.

After that conversation, the next day I checked in with him, not for an answer, just to see if he was okay. He initially thought I was demanding a decision and got irritated. I clarified that I was just checking because I love him and care, like did you eat, are you okay, do you want to talk before I leave. He softened, smiled, and we hugged.


Then last night happened. He bought dinner, I lay next to him, things felt normal, even soft. I showed him a funny video while he was getting ready for bed. He asked me something from across the room while the video was still loud. I didn’t hear him because I was trying to pause it. It took a couple taps. By the time it stopped, he was repeating his question angrily because he thought I was ignoring him. I was shocked. I asked if he would rather I sleep in my room, and he said “does it matter?” in an angry distant tone.

That question hit me harder than the misunderstanding. It wasn’t about the video. It was about whether my presence matters. I left to calm down, then texted explaining I genuinely couldn’t hear him, and that I wasn’t ignoring him. He apologized and said he doesn’t know why feeling ignored triggers him, especially since he mumbles and was far away. I reassured him I would never deliberately ignore him and I told him it does matter to me.

And on top of all this, there is the Valentine’s detail that pushed me over emotionally. He bought underwear, the same brand he usually gifts me during Valentines. The bag had hearts on it. He hesitated to give it to me, then returned it. When I confronted him, he said “it wasn’t a Valentine’s bag, it was just a [brand's name] bag but they put hearts on it.” I had already thanked him for thinking of me. It is not about the bag. It is about the retreat and then the minimization. If he said “I bought it and panicked,” I would have been hurt but grounded. Instead it felt like he rewrote the meaning to avoid owning the hesitation.

Maybe unnecessary details: it hurts in a way I don’t even know how to articulate to watch our roommate, (Trans White Woman, 30), who started as my friend, use the pet names I came up with for him, rub her cheek against his beard, hug him freely, and be met with warmth and ease, while I feel like I am rationed affection. I was struggling to even get an “I love you” back without initiating it first and now I get nothing back. The contrast is painful. It makes me feel displaced in my own relationship. I realize my isolation also made it seem like I abandoned her, but this feels like punishment when my isolation was a safety measure in a place foreign to me (geographically). There was also the day I found her dilating on his bed (she is trans), the same bed we sleep in and are intimate in. I asked him to set that boundary with her because it made me uncomfortable. He never did. I ended up telling her myself, and she apologized to me. I was left once again handling something that should have been his responsibility. And tonight, after minimizing the Valentine’s underwear and making me feel like I was overinterpreting something meaningful, he went out dancing with her while I stayed home crying. That juxtaposition is what cuts the deepest. It is not just about jealousy. It is about watching him show ease, playfulness, and social energy outward while I feel emotionally starved inward.

This is where I am now. The relationship is not explosive, it is tender and fragile and confusing. There is care, there are moments of softness, there are apologies. But there is also chronic avoidance and inconsistency that makes me feel alone, and I am starting to feel like whatever I do irritates him, and sometimes I wonder if he wants me to initiate leaving so he doesn’t have to be the one to end it.

When I imagine five more years of this pattern, my body tightens. I am not asking if he is evil. I am asking if this is emotional avoidance that can change with therapy and real effort, or if this is a fundamental mismatch where I over function and he under functions, and I will slowly shrink trying to keep the relationship alive.
I dont know what I need, I honestly just feel alone and gaslit and guilty and misunderstood and punished all at the same time and I'm scared being in this place we share all alone without family here..

I guess the only good thing that came out of this is how comfortably I talked to my sister about this for an advice and some support she generously gave, despite not understanding my sexual orientation. It brought us closer and I always dreamed of leaning on my sister when it comes to my love life so.. ♡",1,1771483591.0,AvoidantBreakUps,0,1.0,False

As the title says, I’m looking for the best neighborhood in Halifax. I’ll be moving there soon and would love your opinions!

In my view, a ""good"" neighborhood is close enough to downtown to be reachable by foot or public transit (10-15 min), with plenty of coffee shops, local boutiques, good restaurants, libraries, and parks.

I lived in Ottawa for 3 years and Montreal for 1.5 years. My favorite spots were:

Ottawa: Little Italy and the Glebe.

Montreal: Outremont, Plateau, Rosemont, Little Italy, and the Laurier avenue area.

I know I shouldn’t expect the exact same vibe as Montreal or Ottawa, but I’m eager to get to know the city. I don’t really see myself living right downtown; I’d much prefer being part of a real community.

Or it’s preferable to live in downtown like a newcomer ? 

Thanks for your help!

Also if you have a good recommendation of A descent rent in this neighborhood I’m way more interested!

\-I was late. The cafe we were going to go to was closed that day- he wasn’t even remotely upset with me, and said, ok, lead the way, where are we going now? (you have no idea how much this meant to me-my last partner would freak out every time a tiny little thing went wrong and it would ruin the entire date. potentially even the weekend.)

\-Full belly laughs, haven’t laughed that long and hard with someone in a longgg time. so sharp and witty and funny

\-He was a perfect gentleman- he drove to my part of town, held open the door for me multiple times. since he had to go farther, i offered to pay for the coffee- he fought me and bought it for me??? he even offered to drive me closer to my house so i didn’t have to walk since he knew i walked there. he texted me that he had a wonderful date and that he wanted to see me again

\- been single for several years and can talk about his ex without animosity- was totally matter of fact about her and didn’t go on forever

\- independent- has a life, friends, a steady job he’s good at and likes well enough, hobbies, a handle on his mental health, goals and dreams, a studio apartment, a car OMG!!!

\-emotionally intelligent- he could read exactly how i was feeling and i could read exactly how he was feeling. we just knew- i didn’t have to sit there and guess. conversation was easy and we both put in equal work to keep it flowing

\-THE BEST PART: we both kept getting distracted by all the animals nearby- just the best dogs and birds and animals ever out because it was sunny. (he had a picture of his family’s dogs on his credit card too OMG.) there was a lady who put her dog on a post outside so she could run in and go order some food- but he noticed she got loose. he called her over, and the dog immediately came running over and cuddled with him and got all the pets. he kept the dog from wandering off or running out into the middle of the street until the woman could come back. when she came back, she was so apologetic and he went “oh no, it’s no problem! she’s such a good girl :) “ and he was just so aggressively kind to the cashier working the register- AJDGDKFHKFHDJRJF!!!!!

I haven’t felt this sexy in years. I haven’t been this attracted to someone in years. BRB buying new cute underwear holy hell

I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop- something must be wrong. He must secretly be an asshole. We don’t align with kids or religion, but I’m not necessarily looking for a husband.

1r8rxcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/notioncreations/comments/1r8rxcp/ive_launched_11_notion_templates_in_a_year/,I've launched 11 Notion templates in a year. HealthOS was the hardest to build. Here's what I learned that the other 10 didn't teach me.,"Quick context. I've been building Notion systems for about a year. WritersOS, PoetryOS, PolymathOS, 11 products total. Most solve organization problems for creative or knowledge work.

HealthOS started differently. I got diagnosed with chronic asthma in July and quickly realized the stakes of getting this wrong were not the same as the others.



Doctors tell you to track triggers, log symptoms, notice patterns between meals and flare-ups and stress. Reasonable advice. What they don't give you is any framework for doing it systematically.

So you improvise. Notes app. Random journal. A basic Notion page with bullet points.

It feels like progress until you show up to your next appointment and the doctor asks ""noticed any patterns?"" and you're piecing together whatever you happened to remember that morning.

**That's the real problem. Not that people aren't tracking. It's that the tracking produces entries, not answers.**



Chronic illness data is only useful when it connects.

Your diet affects your symptoms. Stress affects how your medication performs. Sleep influences pain levels. Insurance coverage shapes your treatment options.

None of that shows up in an event log. Symptom happens, you record it, you close the app. The entry sits there with no relationship to anything around it.

After months of that you have a long list of things that happened and no real understanding of why. Every appointment you attend with vague impressions instead of clear data is an appointment where you're leaving value on the table. For people managing serious conditions, that gap has real consequences.



After building 10 other systems I knew the answer wasn't more tracking. It was better architecture.

**The principle I landed on: single source of truth for diagnoses, everything else built as relations and rollups around it.**

Not ""I feel bad today.""

Instead: symptom logged, connected to what I ate, linked to current medications, tagged with stress level, associated with my diagnosis, pattern detection runs automatically.

The system computes something from the data rather than just storing it.



**The architecture: 10 modules, 28 interconnected databases**

* **Diagnosis Hub** \- sits at the centre. Every other module relates back to it. This is what makes the whole system behave as one connected picture rather than ten separate logs.
* **Symptom Tracker** \- connects to diet, medications, stress, and sleep simultaneously. Log a symptom and it pulls context from every relevant variable automatically.
* **Medication Log** \- links bidirectionally to symptoms and side effects. See whether symptom frequency actually shifted after a dosage change rather than guessing.
* **Diet and Nutrition** \- functions as a trigger correlation engine, not a food diary. Filter foods consumed on high symptom days versus low ones and see real patterns with evidence behind them.
* **Appointments** \- pulls rollups automatically before every visit: symptom frequency over 30 days, medication adherence rate, cost breakdown, changes since last visit.
* **Mental Health** \- chronic illness and mental health are deeply connected. This gives it a proper place in the system rather than an afterthought.
* **Exercise and Physical Activity** \- tracks what you're doing and how your body responds, useful for finding what's sustainable.
* **Insurance and Health Costs** \- bills, coverage, claims, pending items. Financial data belongs in the health picture because coverage directly affects treatment decisions.
* **Personal Health Goals** \- progress tracking that holds up through flare-ups and slower periods, not just good weeks.
* **Support Network** \- contacts, roles, and coordination for caregivers or family members involved in your care.



**Three things this build taught me that none of the previous ten did:**

**Low-energy design is not optional.** When someone is mid-flare, logging cannot require cognitive effort. Quick-add templates that work in under 30 seconds became essential, not a nice-to-have.

**Time-series data reveals what memory hides.** Weekly rollups showed my symptoms spiked every Thursday, correlating directly with deadline stress. Monthly views caught a dairy pattern I would never have noticed day to day.

**Precise data changes medical conversations.** ""I think it's getting worse"" gets a sympathetic nod. ""Symptom frequency increased 40% over six weeks despite 95% medication adherence"" opens a real diagnostic discussion.



Built entirely with Notion-native features: relations, rollups, formulas. Works on the free tier. No subscriptions, no data leaving your workspace.

This is the first template I built where the architecture had to answer real clinical questions rather than just organize information neatly. That constraint made it a different kind of build.

If you're building health systems in Notion, curious how you handled the relation structure. Did you connect everything into one backbone or keep modules separate?

Both working corporate jobs, packed schedules, constant deadlines — and only **3 days in hand**.

Their simple request:

>

So we designed a **relaxed Shimla itinerary**, and honestly — their experience might fit you too if time is limited.

🚌 **Day 1: Leaving the Chaos Behind (Delhi → Shimla)**

After office hours, they boarded an **overnight Volvo bus from Delhi**.  
No airport stress, no driving fatigue — just a comfortable overnight journey while the city lights slowly disappeared.

By morning, they were in Shimla, already feeling lighter 🌄

  
🌤️ **Day 2: Action, Calm & Evening City Vibes**

After reaching Shimla, they checked into their hotel, freshened up, and **took proper rest**.  
Instead of rushing out immediately, they chose to start their day slow — something they rarely get to do back home.

Their first outing was to **Annandale Army Museum**.

Here, they didn’t just walk around — they experienced something unique.  
Under the supervision of army personnel, they tried a **guided shooting activity with a real rifle** 🎯.  
They learned **how to aim**, how to hold the weapon, and took turns shooting at targets.  
The experience felt thrilling yet safe — like a real-life action game — and became one of their most talked-about memories.

After the **adrenaline rush**, they wanted peace.

**So** next, they headed to **Advance Study (IIAS)**.  
They walked around the heritage building, sat on the green lawns, talked, laughed, and simply enjoyed the open space 🌿.  
No phones, no rush — just quiet time together.

By evening, they moved towards **Mall Road and The Ridge**.  
They strolled **hand in hand**, explored cafés, had coffee, did a bit of shopping, and watched the sunset paint the sky at The Ridge 🌅.  
The cold breeze and soft lights made the evening feel perfect.

They returned to the hotel relaxed and happy.

  
❄️ **Day 3: Snowy Roads, Valleys & a Peaceful Farewell**

The next morning, they headed towards **Kufri**.  
Here, they enjoyed light adventure activities, took pony rides, and soaked in mountain views 🐎.  
It was playful, fun, and not exhausting — just right for a short trip.

On the way back, they stopped at **Green Valley and Fagu Valley**.  
They slowed down, clicked pictures 📸 and enjoyed the silence that only mountain roads offer.  
This part, they later said, felt the most calming.

As evening approached, they visited **Jakhu Peak**.  
They spent time at the temple, watched the sun slowly disappear behind the hills, and felt a deep sense of peace 🙏.  
It was the perfect way to close their mountain escape.

That night, they boarded an **overnight luxury bus back to Delhi** — refreshed, recharged, and already missing the hills.

  
🌟 If you’re also planning a **short Shimla trip** and don’t want it to feel hectic, this itinerary can work beautifully for you too.

And if you ever need **help with hotels, cabs, Volvo tickets, or a registered local guide in Himachal**, you can always reach out — happy to share genuine, on-ground help 😊🏔️

At first I thought it was a coincidence, but now it's clear that they are linked so I won't be taking the collagen anymore. But I can't find any information on why marine collagen might cause migraines. I see people say they get allergic reactions like hives, but nobody mentions migraines.

Has this happened to anyone else? Why would the collagen cause this? Is it specific to the marine type or would all collagen likely have this effect on me?

The thought of returning to work really started to impact me about 6 months before my planned return date. I think the biggest factor was that my ideal part time request had been declined and it was clear I had to return full time. 

The thought of leaving the maternity bubble, the thought of handing my baby over to nursery, the thought of having to care about work the same way I once did. These thoughts were impacting my day to day life. 

I cried daily wondering how so many women in the past had returned to work seemingly without batting an eyelid

Fast forward to today, I am back at work full time compressed into 4 days. 

It’s been a really positive experience so far. I’ve been able to use my brain in ways I forgot I could. Hot drinks, a proper lunch break. I’ve spoken to other mums in the company and had some great support. I have been reminded that I am a person outside of being a mum.

I worked so hard for my career before I had my son and it’s something I also really enjoy. 

Probably controversial to say but I feel like I am giving my toddler far more proper quality time when I am off because I’m savouring every moment. 

My partner isn’t working extra long hours to cover our bills so he also gets to spend more time with our son. 

Do I miss the maternity bubble? Sure. Would it have lasted anyway? Probably not because all the mums around me were returning to work too. Money was getting tighter as the months went on. Days of baby sensory classes and coffee whilst the babies slept in their prams were really over a few months ago. 

My toddler, whilst still not loving drop offs, seems to be doing well at nursery and picking up new skills (and germs) almost daily and proudly showing them off when he returns home. 

Do I still think it’s cruel that society is set up in a way that makes us give our babies to strangers this young and go back to work? Absolutely

Have I remembered part of who I was before becoming a mum and enjoy the independence and break? Also yes. ",7,1771482595.0,BeyondTheBumpUK,1,0.89,False

I am learning about limerence mostly through this subreddit.

He's a senior at work I met almost 1.3 years ago. I didn't take notice of him much initially, but there was this office outing where I first did. I stalked his socials that night and this weird thing started happening since then: I started having dreams about him almost every night.

I was dreaming about him more than I was seeing him in person atp; this probably made me start noticing him a little more in the office. 

Then one random day I caught him looking at me. Didn't think much of it. But it started happening a lot. And it started being obvious (to me) he was doing it on purpose where he would look at me till I looked back and then look away. I'm a very awkward person though so I never fully did anything about it. He's a shy guy but I noticed he tried to have conversation with me at lunch or outings. I was going through a major relationship breakup/turmoil around this time.

But yeah this went on for at least 3 months after which I totally got obsessed. I started feeling like this is the kind of guy I always wanted to marry (no guy ever made me feel like I wanted to marry them including my prev relationship). 

Then things started going downhill. We were working on a project release together where I made a mistake which we'd both be accountable for. He went a little cold. Shortly afterwards, I was back at my hometown (WFH) and in a call (remember he's my senior) for some minor mistakes he started grilling/scolding me in presence of everyone and I started (silently) crying on the call itself. My voice must have given it away, because he didn't utter a single word in that call afterwards.

After a few weeks of this when I came back, he tried to initiate conversations at lunch but I stayed cold. But he's my senior and I have to work with him- so eventually I let go of my grudge. He too started being nice to me again.

We have had moments since then here and there where we'd go on outings and at points it felt too obvious that he likes me or looks at me and at points where it felt like he didn't give a F.

Eventually since last few months we almost became friends where we all would joke around a lot at lunch and evening coffee, and it felt like he was over it: he never looked at me anymore. I sent him request on insta also. But he never liked any of my posts or even saw any stories. 

He switched teams recently but still sits near us. And now I switched to a different team also, in a different building. I won't almost see him around anymore most likely. But this idea has been crushing me. Suddenly this utter urge has come back, the same old feelings that this was supposed to be the guy I married. That I want him and only him under all circumstances. It's embarassing. I stared at him so hard at his farewell partyy I cringe at the thought. I'm going back where my old team sits in hope of just getting a glance of him. I don't even want to get over it seems. It's been a year of this, so I'm starting to get so tired and frustrated.

“We have to get this right,” Grace Penn states, “Otherwise, it could sink my entire presidency.”

Suddenly Kate, after pulling an all-nighter sneaks into the room through the service entrance and says, “Taylor Sheridan”.

Everyone groans.  Penn shoots Hal a dirty look.  Hal shoots Kate a dirty look.  Kate points down between her legs and repeats, “Taylor Sheridan”.  Suddenly, Hal is on board.

The director calls for more hustle, more bustle.  The interns begin shuffling papers and typing even more frantically.

“Taylor Sheridan” - Kate repeats this several more times while Penn frowns and makes faces.

Penn calls in Eidra and asks what she thinks, “We can make it work” says Eidra.

Penn turns to one of the male interns, “What do you think?” She asks.  “Taylor Sheridan is awesome !” Replies the intern, knocking over his coffee.

# 1. My Experience of taking meds & benefitting from regular breaks

Mediation really does work well for me if I can keep my dose timings and routines consistent, however I find that I uncontrollably hyper focus on running my business for long periods of time - like weeks can fly past where I honestly care about little else! It’s a blast enjoying my work (which is inherently mega stressful and usually burns me out after 2-3 days), BUT, it’s not in a healthy way!

As I have a family and am just past the halfway mark of my 30’s I really want to find balance in exercise, family, hobbies etc much better.

So, I found that I really enjoy taking a break from my medication every few weeks, for between 2-7 days on average towards the 7 days I get start to get overwhelmed and feel burnout creeping in. The balance of cutting off from work mode, sleeping easier, having a few coffees/beers for a change, and just enjoying my ADHD side for a bit. It seems to suit me really well - I honestly could see this balance working well in the long term for my mental health at least.

However…. My tremendous issue I am facing…

# 2. The worryingly unhealthy issue

After a short break (even just 2-3 days), the first day of restarting meds I basically can’t sleep for the first night, and the 2nd night seems to be a crap 1-3 hours at most, day 3 onwards I’m returning to normal-ish sleep quality but mindful I’m now operating with -16 hours debt and unable to get truly deep, restful sleep to meaningfully catch up.

I’m really concerned how bad for my health this could be, I’ve consistently missed 1-2 nights sleep every few weeks since December (I think), and seemingly can only catch up on sleep during the medication breaks where I’m sleeping great quality for +4 hours more than usual per night and feeling good for it.

# 3. My plea for help!

Does anyone have any tips how to maintain normal-ish sleep when restarting the medication or have any tips?

Should I be easing back into things at a much lower dose? Not having the boosters to start? If so how many days should I take to build back up to a full prescription dose?

Is the health impact this could be having on my body outweighing any benefit of having a break in the first place?

My prescriber just says it happens as your body needs to get used to it again and lowering the dose could help but ultimately I need to figure out what works for me if I want to be taking breaks, as everyone is different and they don’t typically prescribe “breaks” as a necessary thing.

Would love to just hear if others manage to even take regular breaks with sleep not being impacted in this way. I will cling to any hope!!",2,1771482160.0,ADHDUK,1,1.0,False

1r8rmah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Han47fiction/comments/1r8rmah/the_voice/,The Voice,"He was twenty-four when he discovered that other people experienced thought as language.

It happened during a conversation with his sister, something mundane about grocery shopping that had somehow turned philosophical. She had mentioned making a mental list, and when he asked what she meant, she looked at him as though he’d asked her to explain breathing.

“You know. The voice in your head. The one that tells you what you need.”

“You mean you hear yourself thinking?” The question came out more sharply than he’d intended.

“Of course I do. Don’t you?”

He didn’t. His thoughts arrived as something more fundamental than words—as pure concept, as knowing without the scaffolding of language. When he looked at a red car, he simply understood its redness, its car-ness, without narration. He had spent twenty-four years assuming this was universal, that the internal monologues in books and films were merely literary convention.

That night, he fell into research with the particular obsession of someone who has just discovered they’ve been living with an undiagnosed condition. Anauralia, the articles called it. The absence of an internal monologue. Not a disorder, the sources were careful to emphasize. Just a neurological variation, like being left-handed or having perfect pitch.

He felt relief first, then a hollowness that surprised him with its weight. He had always suspected he was missing something essential, some faculty that would have made certain aspects of existence less opaque. Now he knew the shape of that absence, and knowing made it worse.

Three weeks passed before he heard it.

*I’m hungry.*

The thought arrived with such clarity that he stopped walking, his body going still on the sidewalk while people flowed around him with the practiced indifference of city dwellers. The voice had been distinct, unmistakable. His own voice, but internal. Residing somewhere behind his eyes, in that space he had always assumed was silent for everyone.

He waited for more. Nothing came. But that evening, as he stood over the stove watching garlic brown in olive oil, he heard it again.

*This smells good.*

The smile that crossed his face felt involuntary, a physical manifestation of relief so profound it bordered on grief. He had it now. The thing he’d been missing. The voice that everyone else took for granted.

His therapist seemed pleased when he told her the following week. They had been working on his sense of isolation, his difficulty connecting with others, and she saw this development as progress of some kind.

“How does it feel?” she asked, pen poised over her notepad.

“Natural,” he said, and meant it. “Like it was always supposed to be there. Like I was incomplete before.”

She made a note, her expression warm with professional satisfaction. “The brain is remarkably plastic. Perhaps you’ve developed this capacity over time. Neurological adaptation.”

He left the session feeling lighter than he had in years, as though he’d been carrying a weight he hadn’t known existed until it was lifted.

The voice began with small observations. Traffic patterns. The aesthetic qualities of coffee shops. Reminders about calling his mother. The kind of mundane internal commentary that, he now understood, comprised the background noise of most people’s consciousness. He didn’t act on every thought—didn’t need to. But the presence itself was comforting, organizing, proof that his mind was finally working the way minds were supposed to work.

For the first time in his life, he felt less alone inside his own head.

Two months into this new way of being, the voice became more assertive.

*That guy’s an asshole.*

*She’s lying to you.*

*You’re working yourself to death. You need rest.*

The observations felt sharper now, more like insights than simple narration. He found himself trusting these assessments, following the suggestions that arrived with such conviction. They were his thoughts, after all. His own mind finally speaking to him with the clarity it had always possessed but never been able to articulate.

When the voice suggested he quit his job.

*You’re wasting your potential in this place.*

He gave notice within the week. When it pointed out that his girlfriend’s affection seemed performative.

*She doesn’t love you, not really*.

He ended the relationship with a certainty that surprised them both.

The voice was helping him see clearly. Make better decisions. Become more fully himself.

Six months after the voice had arrived, it told him to hurt someone.

He was walking through a parking garage, the fluorescent lights casting everything in shades of gray and yellow, when the thought arrived with the same calm certainty as all the others.

*That man in the gray coat. He deserves it.*

The man was perhaps thirty feet ahead, fishing keys from his pocket, oblivious. There was nothing remarkable about him. Middle-aged. Slightly overweight. The kind of person you’d pass a hundred times without noticing.

He stopped walking. His heart had begun to accelerate in a way that felt disconnected from conscious decision.

*He hurt someone you love.*

The voice was patient, explanatory. You don’t remember, but I do. He deserves to suffer for what he did.

“No,” he whispered, the word escaping before he’d decided to speak it.

*Yes.*

The voice didn’t waver.

*You know I’m right. I’m you. This is what you want, what you’ve always wanted but been too afraid to acknowledge.*

He stood there as other people moved past him, going about their ordinary business of retrieving cars and returning to lives that didn’t include this kind of conversation. His breathing had gone shallow.

*You’ve spent your whole life being passive. Too kind. Too accommodating.*

The voice was gentle now, almost tender.

*This is who you really are. I’m just helping you see it. Listen to me.*

He didn’t know this man. Couldn’t recall ever seeing him before, though the parking garage was attached to a building he visited weekly. But the voice was his voice. His thoughts. His will finally articulating itself after twenty-four years of silence.

If he wanted to hurt this man and he did want it, he could feel the desire like a physical thing in his chest, then somewhere in the architecture of his consciousness, there must be a reason. The voice wouldn’t lie to him. The voice was him.

He followed the man home.

It took forty minutes of driving through suburbs that all looked identical in the failing light. He parked three houses down and waited as darkness settled over the street like a held breath. The man’s house was modest, unremarkable. A single light visible through front windows.

He sat in his car for twenty minutes, hands gripping the steering wheel, his entire body a chorus of protest. Every instinct that had kept him safe and functional for twenty-four years was screaming at him to leave, to drive away, to forget this had ever seemed like a reasonable course of action.

But the voice was so certain. So calm.

*This is who you are. You’re just finally listening to yourself.*

He got out of the car. Walked to the back door. His hand found the handle with a sureness that felt like muscle memory, though he’d never been here before, had never done anything remotely like this.

*Do it. Open the door.*

His hand was shaking so badly he almost couldn’t turn the knob. But it was unlocked. Some distant part of his mind registered this as significant, as though the universe itself was sanctioning what he was about to do. The door opened with barely a sound.

The man was in the living room, facing away, watching something on television. The blue light flickered across his shoulders. He didn’t turn. Didn’t hear the door, didn’t sense the presence now standing in his kitchen.

*Now. Do it now.*

He saw the lamp before he consciously decided to pick it up. Heavy base. Ceramic. Substantial enough to do what needed to be done. His hands closed around it, and the shaking stopped.

*Yes. Like that.*

He walked into the living room. The man still didn’t turn. He raised the lamp, and in that moment before impact, he felt something that might have been peace or might have been the complete absence of himself.

He swung.

The police found him three hours later, sitting at the kitchen table in a house that wasn’t his, covered in blood that wasn’t his, his face bearing an expression the responding officers would later describe as eerily calm.

“Why did you do this?” they asked him, and the question seemed to come from very far away.

“He deserved it.”

“Did you know him?”

“No.”

“Then why? Why would you do this to a stranger?”

He looked at his hands, at the blood drying between his fingers, and tried to find an answer that would make sense to people who had always heard voices in their heads, who had always known the difference between their own thoughts and something else.

“I wanted to,” he said finally. “I thought it. So I did it.”

The psychiatric evaluation took two weeks, most of which he spent in a room painted the particular shade of beige that institutions seem to believe has calming properties. The doctor who finally sat down across from him had kind eyes and a notepad that looked well-used.

“Do you still hear the voice?” she asked.

“Yes. It’s me. My thoughts finally taking the form they were supposed to have.”

“When did it start?”

“Six months ago. Before that, I had anauralia. No internal voice. Just silence where everyone else had narration.”

The doctor made a note with the careful precision of someone who has learned to keep her face neutral in the presence of terrible revelations. She looked at him for a long moment, and in her expression he saw something that made his stomach drop.

“The voice you’re hearing,” she said quietly, “isn’t yours.”

He stared at her. The room had gone very still.

“Command auditory hallucinations. Late-onset schizophrenia. The timing of onset, the progression, the nature of the commands, it follows a textbook presentation.”

*She’s wrong.*

The voice was immediate, insistent.

*I’m you. I’ve always been you. She doesn’t understand.*

“Most people develop their internal monologue in childhood,” the doctor continued. “They learn to distinguish between their own thoughts and intrusive ones, between volition and compulsion. But you never had that. You had no baseline. No way to know what your own thoughts were supposed to sound like.”

She didn’t finish the explanation. She didn’t need to.

He sat there, looking down at his hands. The same hands that had killed a man he’d never met, destroyed a life he’d had no connection to, all because a voice that sounded exactly like him had told him it was right. A voice he’d welcomed when it arrived, had been grateful for, had trusted completely because he’d had no framework for understanding that thoughts could come from somewhere other than the self.

*I’m still here*.

The voice whispered, and it did sound like him, exactly like him, indistinguishable from what he’d always imagined his own thoughts might sound like if they ever took the form of language.

*I’m not going anywhere.*",2,1771481726.0,Han47fiction,1,1.0,False

Senior year I was forced to get rid of it and buy a reliable car because payments to fix the car became more than it was worth. Parents talked me into purchasing a 2024 Toyota Corolla SE. Very boring but has served its purpose up until this point. A year later I graduated college  and landed a well paying job in my area(100k).

For this past year since graduating college and working full time I paid off all debt(student loans and car) by living at home with parents. I’m looking to move into my own apartment soon and have a decent emergency fund saved.

Now I want to trade in my car for something more enjoyable to drive. My goal is to either have a really low car payment or just wait longer and pay for the remaining portion of the car in cash. I want to enter the car scene, modify my car, go to meets/cars and coffee. I just feel like I can’t or it’s kind of pointless to do that in my Corolla. I’ve really been into the gr86.

1r8ri91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Han47fiction/comments/1r8ri91/the_passenger/,The Passenger,"Sunday morning he woke with a throbbing headache and turned on the television to find a house on the news. The brick facade and small front yard struck him as familiar in a way he couldn’t quite articulate, like recognizing a face but forgetting the name that went with it.

Monday morning his phone buzzed with news alerts about a murder, and when he clicked through to the article he found himself staring at the same house from the day before. The address confirmed what his mind was already piecing together: he had dropped someone there Saturday night. The realization sat in his chest with a peculiar weight, not quite alarm, not quite curiosity, but something suspended between the two.

He remained in bed for a while, watching frost patterns spread across the window. It had been a cold week. The roads had been treacherous with ice most nights, the kind of weather that made driving feel like a prolonged negotiation with physics. Tuesday brought another alert, another house he recognized. Wednesday, another. By Friday morning there were six murders scattered across the city, and he knew every address as intimately as he knew his own route home.

The pattern was too precise to ignore. He opened his Uber app and scrolled through the previous week’s history, watching the rides materialize on his screen like evidence of something he couldn’t yet name. Six rides. Monday through Saturday. Six different pickup locations, six residential dropoffs. The timestamps aligned perfectly. Each murder had occurred within an hour of when he had left someone at their door.

The decision to call the police felt less like courage and more like inevitability, the way water finds its level.

The dispatcher was professional in that particular way that suggested she had taken thousands of similar calls. She thanked him for reaching out and asked if he could come to the station. He said he would come immediately, though in truth he felt no urgency, only a kind of methodical obligation.

The detective who met him had tired eyes that suggested he had seen enough of human nature to no longer be surprised by it. He led him to an interview room that smelled faintly of coffee and cleaning solution, and asked him to explain why he had called.

“I think I might have information about the murders,” he said. “I’m an Uber driver. I drove someone to all six of those addresses last week. Monday through Saturday.”

The detective’s posture shifted slightly, a subtle recalibration of attention. “Can you describe this person?”

“I couldn’t see his face,” he said, and even as he spoke he found himself questioning how he knew this with such certainty. “He kept it hidden somehow. Turned toward the window, or covered. But it felt deliberate.”

“The same person all six nights?”

He considered this. “I believe so. The way he sat, the way he moved. There was a consistency to it. But I never saw his face clearly enough to be certain.”

The detective made notes with the economical movements of someone who had written the same things countless times. “Height? Build?”

He tried to reconstruct the memory, but found only vague impressions. “Average height, perhaps. He always sat in the back seat. I was focused on driving, on the road conditions. The ice.”

“What about his voice?”

“He told me the addresses. Nothing else that I recall. Nothing distinctive.”

“Walk me through the week,” the detective said. “Start with Monday.”

He took a breath and began arranging the facts in chronological order, like assembling pieces of furniture from unlabeled parts. “Monday night, around 9:45 PM, I accepted a ride. Downtown pickup. Someone got in the back seat. I asked for their name to confirm the ride, the way you do. He said John. We drove in silence to the destination. I dropped him off at a residential address and left.”

“You didn’t go inside?”

“No. I dropped him at the curb. That’s standard procedure.”

“Then what?”

“I moved on to the next fare. Accept a ride, complete it, accept another. That’s how the system functions.”

The detective recorded this. “Tuesday?”

“The same sequence. Different pickup location, different dropoff address. But the same name. John. The same way of sitting, of hiding his face. The same silence filling the car.”

“Wednesday?”

“The same pattern repeated itself. Thursday, Friday, Saturday. Six nights in total. Always the name John. Always that sense of deliberate concealment. Six residential dropoffs.”

The detective studied him with an expression that might have been sympathy or suspicion or simply fatigue. “Do you have records of these rides?”

He showed him the app history, watching the detective examine each entry with methodical attention. Six rides, all logged with precise timestamps and addresses, all rendered in the clean interface of modern technology that made even murder look like data.

“Did you notice anything unusual about this passenger’s behavior? Anything they said or did?”

“Just that he was hiding his face. That registered as unusual. But otherwise, no. He was quiet. He gave me the address and we drove. That was the extent of our interaction.”

“Did he carry anything? Bags, packages?”

He tried to access the memory, but found only absence where details should have been. “I don’t believe so. I don’t remember seeing anything.”

The detective asked more questions, each one an attempt to extract meaning from his fragmentary recollections. Whether he had seen anyone else near the houses. Whether the passenger had made phone calls during the rides. Whether he had exited quickly or lingered. He answered as best he could, though he was increasingly aware of how thin his testimony was, how much of what he described was inference rather than direct observation.

After an hour of this careful excavation, the detective thanked him for coming in. “We’ll be in touch if we need anything else. You did the right thing calling us.”

He left the station with a curious mixture of relief and unease settling over him. Relief that he had reported what he knew, however incomplete that knowledge was. Unease at the thought that he had spent a week transporting someone who had used those rides as preludes to murder.

The drive home took forty minutes through afternoon traffic that moved with its own mysterious logic. He was approximately three miles from his apartment when he felt the car pull to the right with that unmistakable rhythm that meant tire failure. He pulled onto the shoulder, activated his hazards, and stepped out into the cold.

The rear passenger tire had gone completely flat.

He opened the trunk to retrieve the spare, a task he had performed perhaps three times in his life, always with a sense of mild incompetence. The trunk was mostly empty, containing only some basic emergency supplies and the spare tire compartment. He lifted the cover.

There was no spare tire where one should have been.

Instead he found a regular tire that was also flat, and beside it, a plastic bag.

He stared at these objects, trying to construct a narrative that would explain their presence. Then he walked back to examine the flat tire more carefully, crouching down to study it. The tire wasn’t original equipment. It was already a spare, smaller than the others, with a different tread pattern that should have been obvious.

He had been driving on a spare tire without knowing when or why he had installed it.

He returned to the trunk and looked at the bag again. Through the plastic he could see six phones stacked on top of each other like a small monument to something he didn’t understand.

He didn’t own six phones. He had never seen these particular phones before. Their presence in his trunk seemed to violate some fundamental principle of causality, as though they had materialized from nowhere.

He reached for the bag, then hesitated. The wrongness of the situation was becoming impossible to ignore, a wrongness that seemed to extend beyond the mere fact of finding inexplicable objects in his car. He pulled out his phone to call the police, but before he could dial he heard a car approaching. He closed the trunk quickly, moved by an irrational worry that whoever was passing might see and understand something he himself didn’t understand.

He waited for the car to pass, then opened the trunk again. The bag remained exactly where he had left it, as though it had always been there, waiting to be discovered. He lifted it out carefully and set it on the ground. The phones shifted inside with a sound like plastic clicking against plastic. Different models, different ages. One had a cracked screen. Another displayed a family photo through a clear case.

He stood on the shoulder of the highway, staring at six phones he had never seen before, trying to construct a logical explanation for how they had come to be in his possession. The cold was working its way through his jacket, but he barely noticed. He bent down to pick up the bag again, thinking he would return it to the trunk so he could make his call from somewhere warmer.

As he bent down, his foot found a patch of ice.

The fall happened faster than thought. His head struck the asphalt with a sound he felt more than heard, and everything went white, then gray, then slowly, reluctantly, back into focus. He lay there on the frozen ground, staring up at the overcast sky, and felt something fundamental shift in his understanding of the week behind him.

The memories didn’t return all at once. They came in sequence, methodical and complete.

Monday night. The passenger getting into his car, not a shadowy figure but a real person, a man in his forties with kind eyes who smiled when he gave the address. He drove him home through the icy streets. Parked at the curb. And then, instead of driving away to accept another fare, he got out. He followed the man to his door. He waited while the man unlocked it, key fumbling slightly in the cold. He followed him inside, into the warmth of a stranger’s home.

The knife was already in his hand. He understood now that he had brought it for this purpose.

What happened next unfolded with the terrible efficiency of something rehearsed. When it was finished, he took the man’s phone. He wiped it down carefully. He placed it in a plastic bag he had brought specifically for this purpose.

Tuesday night. A different person, a woman this time. The same sequence repeated itself with slight variations. Follow her inside. The knife. Her phone added to the bag, which now contained two.

Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday.

Six people. Six houses. Six phones accumulated in the bag like evidence of something he could no longer pretend not to understand.

And then the memories extended further back, beyond this week, beyond this city. Other places. Portland. Seattle. Denver. Phoenix. Always the same pattern. Drive for a week. Six passengers. Six houses. Dispose of the evidence. Move to a new city. Start the cycle again.

This city was supposed to be different. He had been planning to stop after these six. To retire, in a sense. To disappear into some other life that didn’t require this particular routine.

Saturday night, after the sixth, he drove to an isolated area near the industrial district where he had planned to burn the phones and complete the cycle one final time. But when he arrived he discovered his tire was flat. He pulled over, opened the trunk. He placed the bag in the spare tire compartment while he worked on changing the tire. The lug nuts were stuck, frozen by the cold. It took longer than he had anticipated, his fingers growing numb as he worked. By the time he finally got the spare tire mounted, he was exhausted and frustrated.

He threw the flat tire in the trunk and started to close it.

That’s when his feet slipped out from under him.

Ice. The industrial parking lot was a sheet of it. His head hit the concrete with enough force to crack something open, though whether it was his skull or his memory he couldn’t immediately tell.

Everything went dark.

When he regained consciousness, he was confused in a way that went beyond simple disorientation. He didn’t know why he was at this industrial area. He didn’t remember the phones in his trunk. He didn’t remember changing the tire. He didn’t remember the six houses, the six people, the six nights that had led him here.

He got back in his car and drove home through streets that seemed vaguely familiar but also strange, as though he were seeing his own city through someone else’s eyes. Nothing but fragments remained. Just a sense that he had been driving, that he had been working, that everything had been routine and unremarkable.

Sunday morning he woke with a throbbing headache and turned on the television to find a house on the news. The brick facade and small front yard struck him as familiar in a way he couldn’t quite articulate, like recognizing a face but forgetting the name that went with it.",1,1771481346.0,Han47fiction,1,1.0,False

Before that, days passed easily. Mornings began with unfinished sleep and ended with tired laughter. The library wasn’t just a place to study; it was a shelter. Three chairs, one table, scattered notebooks, meaningless conversations that somehow mattered more than the syllabus. Nothing was planned. Nothing was forced. It was just there.

He didn’t fall in love the way people describe it.
There was no lightning, no sudden realization. It was gradual — a warmth that stayed longer each day. Her voice when she joked. The way she spoke like a child pretending to be grown, and a grown person protecting her softness. The comfort of knowing he could say almost anything when she was in that mood. Those were the moments he carried quietly, never daring to hold them too tightly.

He waited.
Not because he didn’t care — but because he cared too much.
Courage came late. By the time he spoke, the moment had already shifted. The confession wasn’t dramatic. It was clumsy, sincere, vulnerable. And vulnerability doesn’t always get rewarded — sometimes it simply changes things.
After that, the world rearranged itself without asking him.

Benches were still there, but they felt occupied even when empty.
Corridors became narrower.
The mess felt louder, but less welcoming.
He started choosing paths not because they were shorter, but because they reduced the chance of running into her.

And then there were the sights he never prepared for.

An auto stopping nearby.
Two people sitting close.
A door visible from his window that he never wanted to notice but couldn’t stop seeing.
He told himself stories.
Maybe she didn’t mean it.
Maybe it wasn’t serious.
Maybe there was still space for him — not as someone special, just as someone present.
What hurt most wasn’t that she chose someone else.
It was that she stopped choosing him in the small ways — the effortless conversations, the unguarded time, the easy presence.
He blamed himself constantly.
If I had been bolder.
If I hadn’t acted awkward.
If I hadn’t created distance while craving closeness.
He replayed moments like a broken tape, imagining better versions of himself — someone who invited her over, someone who spoke with confidence, someone who didn’t hesitate. In every imagined version, things turned out differently. And in every real version, he sat alone.
Some days surprised him.
When he talked to her briefly in the lab, he felt calm — and that scared him. He wondered if calm meant healing, or if it meant he was fooling himself again. Other days, the distance crushed him more than her presence ever had. It wasn’t seeing her that broke him — it was knowing he couldn’t reach her the way he once did.
Nights were the hardest.
That’s when memories returned gently, almost kindly. Not to mock him, but to remind him that something real had existed. He dreamed of conversations that never ended, of laughter that didn’t need effort. Waking up felt like losing her all over again.
He didn’t want grand love stories anymore.
He wanted normalcy.
He wanted to study without checking the door.
He wanted to sit in the mess longer without anxiety.
He wanted late-night walks that didn’t involve looking away from windows.
He wanted to laugh with colleagues over coffee and forget, just for an hour, that his chest once carried something heavy.
Healing didn’t arrive as closure.
There was no final conversation.
No clear ending.
Healing arrived quietly.
It came as fewer urges to text.
As moments where he noticed the sky again.
As days where manga replaced overthinking, and silence didn’t feel threatening.
He realized something slowly — painfully — honestly.
Not all connections are meant to last.
Some exist to show you that you can feel deeply, care genuinely, and still survive when it ends.
And one evening, while walking across campus, he noticed it felt… bigger.
Not emptier.
Just bigger.
There was still a quiet space inside him.
But it no longer hurt the same way.
It had become room.",1,1771481192.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

I'm currently (from est conception) 8w6d pregnant, I have hypothyroidism (discovered after last year miscarriage at 5w3d) I monitor my thyroid often as its a risk for pregnancy but could not up my dose till around 3-4 weeks after conception (this is important for later)
At my last ultrasound with my OB 2 weeks ago they only could see the gestational sac no heartbeat of course it was only 6w+ at that time, they also saw a small subchorionic hematoma told me to come back in 2 weeks. 
Now its almost been 2 weeks since. About 72 hours ago in the early after noon my second time going pee I noticed a light off coloring to the toilet paper after use. I decided to get fresh tissue and pressed it slightly into my self to check for bleeding and brown blood was there. I panicked and went to the emergency room. They said they could see the sac but it appears to be just barely at 6 week gestation (which makes no sense bc im at 8 weeks+) they didn't mention any hematoma and they did test my hcg levels but I've not gotten that result back. As far as they could tell I was in fact still pregnant so they sent me home not many answers follow up with my OB.
Its been 3 days since this started, the brown bleeding has NOT been heavy, ive seen little bits of tissue or clotting kinda like coffee grinds sorta, it hasn't even hit my pantie liners. Its only been visible through normal wiping once, unless I press toilet paper slightly into my self I dont see it, it doesnt flow out its been very light and always brown and old looking. But tonight I think im feeling some minor cramping and the brown is starting to look more red toned when I check myself. Keep in mind I dont shove a bunch of tissue paper into myself to check just a little bit because the bleeding doesnt really come out on its own and I want to see if it turns bright red.
Im trying hard to be hopeful by seeking out answers to keep me from crying. Maybe this is the hematoma passing? Maybe the gestational sac is slow developing due to my hypothyroidism and me not being able to immediately up my thyroid medication (remember I was at least 3 weeks pregnant before I could up my thyroid medication) maybe that's why the  gestational sac isnt at where it should be yet? Im so worried with a gestational sac being determined 2 weeks behind where it should be and the cramping and the brown light bleeding that might be turning more red im so scared that this is a missed miscarriage starting...
I told my doctor and I already had a appointment friday (a day away) for the ultrasound follow up, she said we can see whats going on then but the hospital hasn't posted my hcg quantitative results yet and the light cramping is making me fear the absolute worst.

I would have stayed longer.
I didn’t rush to leave… but I didn’t know it would be the last time.

I wish I had the courage to speak more directly.
I worried — because your opinions meant so much to me.
Your insight, your perspective…
I was always amazed at how humbly you hid your intelligence.
There was so much depth in you, and I always wanted to see how far it went.

In our time together, I felt I reached deeper than most ever did.
You were guarded — I could see that from the first moment we met.
Your doors were locked tight.
So I knocked. Not forcefully — patiently.
And to my surprise… you opened them.

I never wanted to take advantage of that gift.
Your friendship.
Your acceptance.
Your honesty.
Your loyalty.
Your sporadic sweets, electrolyte drink, some random things that reminded you of me that youd leave on my desk. A coffee cup, a ring, perfume, blankets. 

You felt like a blessing I didn’t deserve.
Maybe that’s why you’re not here anymore — maybe you had higher callings.
But you still show up… in songs, in memories, in the pieces of knowledge you left with me.

Being around you — doing anything or nothing —
those were the moments worth living for.

I miss our talks.
I miss your texts.
Sometimes I want to call your number just to hear your voice…
but I know that voicemail is gone now.

You understood my weird, and I understood yours.
I always made a fool of myself around you — and you never judged, only laughed.
Those memories are unforgettable.

You had the rare trifecta —
beauty, mind, and soul.
Your intelligence fascinated me.
Your depth pulled me in.
Your presence felt like home.

I miss your encouragement.
Your support.
Your voice.
Our deep conversations — even the difficult ones.
You loved deeply once you felt safe, and that always meant everything to me.

I wish we could play cards again, color, or invent some random way to entertain ourselves.
Those simple moments were magic.

You had me — completely.
Hook, line, and sinker.
And a part of me always will belong to you.

If I could have designed the perfect woman for me… it would have been you.
Your personality, your mind, your presence — all of it.

I would have shouted it to the rooftops if you were mine.
I just wish I had told you how I felt.
Maybe things would have been different.

Truth is… I was afraid of your rejection.
I think it would have broken me.
But now I realize silence hurt more.

I wish I’d been brave enough to kiss you the way I always wanted to.

I miss you.
I love you.

If I could, I would still call you mine.
I would give every ounce of myself to have had that chance (knowing what I know now). 🫠
You calling me yours- I'm certain I would have melt. 
I would also ask you to pinch me. 
That would be a dream come true - calling you mine. 
Being your reason to smile. 
Me being yours. 
You just always understood me. 
Even in the silence.

I felt you with me today.
Even if it’s only spiritual now —
thank you for still showing up for me.
You are loved beyond words. 

Rest easy… until I see you again.
There’s a kiss I never had the courage to give you. 💋

I wish I hadn't been so intimidated to tell you how deep my love ran. 
You cant blame a lady. 
You held qualities that set you apart from the rest. 
If you could have seen yourself through my eyes. 
I know that you held insecurities. 
If you only knew how- even with the flaws, you felt made you unlovable. 
Those flaws- your mind- your unique soul.
If you saw yourself how I did. You'd never had felt insecure again. 
There isnt a woman more prefect in my eyes.

Okay, I guess I'll stop rambling. 
I started thinking about my regrets.
Not being courageous enough to express how deep my love ran. I guess you can say still runs. 

I'm beyond blessed to have had you apart of my life's journey. 

Rest easy, babygirl.

I didn't need a drastic weight loss, more like 6-7kg. I was average with a little belly. And I suppose this may have worked for me but it may not work for others. I'm just sharing my experience.

1. I went to the gym. A friend helped me (I was shy to go on my own lmao). It was a group training program (functional program). I'm pretty sure that any form of exercise will do though. Consistency is a key.

2. Apart from consistency you have to push yourself, increase weight, effort etc. Otherwise you're not gonna change.

3. Ironically gym reduced my cravings because at 17:00 where I need something sugarly I was at the gym. My cravings didn't see that coming.

4. Candy? Sure, but once a week not once a day. Plus, no sugar on coffee and nothing other than coffee in my coffee.

5. I was having 5 meals. One of them was greek yogurt 2% fat with a table spoon of honey. The other small meal was a banana with a table spoon of peanut butter (without added sugar, salt and palm oil)

6. I never counted calories but I was trying not to overeat and eat good calories. I had chicken twice a week, fish once a week. Red meat was less than once a week. I also love veggies so it was easy for me.

7. I didn't use protein supplements. I'm not sure if I'm in favor or against them. I just don't consider them the best for me, at least not now. But I took creatine (you can ask your physician or somebody qualified for that) and it helped a lot.

Obviously don’t stop eating protein, but not every food and beverage needs to be enriched with protein!!!!!

God, just stop. Protein is in enough foods and if you’re at at least average intelligence, it’s so God Damn obvious what food contains proteins. Most commonly, ANY MEAT, like chicken, beef, or seafood. Some vegetables have a good amount of protein too. Lentils and tofu come to mind.

But I just saw an ad for Mother Fucking protein cheerios. Mother Fucking \*PROTEIN\* CHEERIOS!!!!! That’s enough. We’ve enriched too much shit. Stop, for the love of god. Guess what? The milk you’re going to use already has protein in it, and it doesn’t need enriching!!!!

And Dunkin Doughnuts (I refuse to call it by the weird shorter name. (Maybe this should be a separate rant‽)) has a protein refresher and Starbucks has protein enriched drinks. Fucking stop. If you add milk, yes, even almond milk, has protein in it. God damn. Just eat one of the breakfast sandwiches they sell. Jesus Christ. Can we not shove protein in everything?

Plus, most people don’t need extra protein. Who in their life is going out of their way to eat protein waffles, with protein cheerios and stopping off at Dunkin’ Doughnuts or Starbucks to get their morning protein coffee? I doubt even Brian Shaw (Like 3/4 time winning strong man) needs to get protein by going to Starbucks. And if someone does need extra protein, why not just use protein powder, a product that has existed long before we decided to add protein to our morning coffee.

TL:DR, Fuck products that are now being enriched with protein. We’ve enriched too many products.

I find I pair best with people who are any (or multiple) of the following:

- Passionate (about SOMETHING. ANYTHING. share your hobbies. I wouldn't know a thing about it but i still wanna learn.)

- Musical (as a listener or creator. i love finding new music outside of my norm and sharing)

- Nerdy (i'm in to a little bit of everything myself but i guess gaming is my big thing. Casuals or ""bad"" gamers welcome too.)

- Alternative (elder emo here. i mostly mean people who aren't afraid to be a little different in their own way, whatever form that takes.)

- Philosophical thinkers (or overthinkers. if you think about what stuff actually means, welcome to the club)

- Silly (long debates over things that requires looney toons logic but taken as seriously as a life or death scenario)

- Honest (not just with others but with yourself. it's a really important quality to be who you are and not pretend to be someone else. Self awareness is key.)

Few tidbits about me:

- I need a good road trip every so often. I don't travel as much as i'd like but i do whenever I can. Be with people, do shit and make memories seems to be the new M.O. at this phase in my life. Which means i'm driving 6 hours to surprise a friend for their birthday next month. I can't think of a better excuse for a road trip than that.

- Some friends dragged convinced me to get back into league and honestly, it's been fun. (Taking applications for duos!) I also have a backlog of single player games i wanna play and have someone watch. I think im a rather good let's player, if i must say.

-  Mental health is probably the name of the game for this year. Now that I live alone, I have space to work on myself and being mindful of my habits. This overnight shift isn't helping if im honest but it's good for me in the short term. The ADHD and anxiety/depression loop is brutal. But im working on it. That said…

- Now that i do have my own space, I've been having a fun time building it out. Shopping for small things to make my life easier and organized. Being a techie, I've been coding home automations for stuff like big stuff like the heat and whole house audio and or small things like my tea kettle. (Having the kettle be hot before you get out off bed is a game changer, trust me)

- A friend described my taste of music isn't a genre or vibe but how ""novel"" it is. I don't think they're wrong but i still feel kinda called out about it. I like songs that can be described as mathy or djenty or jazzy or noisy. I like brass, tapped guitar, poly-rhythms and weird time signatures. Or something that just tells a good story or makes me feel something. I can't describe my taste in music any better than that.

She drove down in her RV and is staying at a caravan park. We had planned a big catch up event for this Saturday, and my friend arrived yesterday. 

When we were planning the trip, she mentioned that she was wanting to bring her two dogs with her (a golden retriever and a Great Dane) with her and asked if that would be an issue for me. I said it would be fine, because she assured me her dogs were well behaved, as long as they stayed in the yard. 

She came over yesterday to say hi, and had the dogs with her. We had coffee in the backyard and the dogs honestly were a lot more energetic than I had imagined. As soon as she let them off the leash they zoomed off around the yard and began peeing on everything, including flowers, the lawn, pot plants, etc. The dane in particular was extremely badly behaved and took a long pee up the side wall of the house as well. I think my friend sensed my discomfort as she poured some water from her bottle onto the wall. One of the dogs also proceeded to poop right on the middle of the back porch (which my friend looked embarrassed when she picked up). 

I asked my friend if she would mind not bringing the dogs on Saturday because they are just too much. She says that she had asked me in advance and I've left her in an awkward situation since she doesn't have anyone to look after the dogs. She said that if they are outside, and we are inside, we won't notice them. She also said that the only reason they were so energetic was because they'd come off a long car ride down. She said she'd take them to pee and poo beforehand so it's not as big of an issue. I told her that it's not my problem and that she lied about them being well behaved.

The evening air hung heavy over the U.A. campus as the last traces of golden sunlight disappeared behind the horizon. Most students of Class 1-A had already retreated to the Heights Alliance dormitory, settling into their routines of studying, training, or simply unwinding after another grueling day of hero coursework.

All except one.

Minoru Mineta was walking back from the convenience store, a plastic bag filled with grape soda and snacks swinging from his wrist. He'd stayed late in the library — not studying, of course, but because he'd found a particularly interesting magazine hidden between two textbooks on Hero Law.

""Man, today was rough,"" he muttered to himself, rubbing the back of his neck. ""Aizawa-sensei made us do combat drills for three hours straight. My beautiful body wasn't built for this kind of punishment.""

He cut through a narrow alleyway between the school's eastern support buildings, a shortcut he'd discovered weeks ago. The path was poorly lit, with only a single flickering lamp casting long, jittering shadows along the concrete walls.

That's when he heard it.

A low, guttural sound — like breath being dragged through a throat filled with gravel.

Mineta froze. His eyes widened to the size of dinner plates.

""N-Nope. Nope nope nope nope nope."" He turned on his heel immediately. ""I've seen enough horror movies to know that the short guy always dies fir—""

Something cold clamped around his shoulder.

He didn't even have time to scream.

A figure — impossibly tall, gaunt, with skin like cracked parchment and eyes that burned a dull, ancient crimson — loomed over him. Its mouth opened, revealing elongated canines that gleamed like polished bone.

""You..."" the creature rasped, its voice echoing as though it came from the bottom of a well. ""You carry... the blood of the night grape... a rare vintage...""

""WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?!"" Mineta shrieked, but it was too late.

The fangs sank into his neck.

For a moment, the world became a kaleidoscope of purple and red, swirling behind his eyelids. He felt something *change* — deep in his cells, deep in his bones, deep in the very marrow of who he was. It was cold and hot at the same time, like swallowing ice that burned.

Then the creature released him, staggering back. Its crimson eyes blinked in confusion.

""Your blood... it tastes like..."" The ancient vampire's face contorted. ""...grape juice?""

And then, as though it had been struck by lightning, the creature disintegrated — crumbling into ash that scattered on the evening breeze, leaving behind nothing but the faint smell of old earth and something sour.

Mineta collapsed to the ground, unconscious. His bag of snacks spilled across the concrete, cans of grape soda rolling in lazy circles around his small, motionless body.

### **The Next Morning — Heights Alliance, Class 1-A Dormitory**

---

The common room of the 1-A dormitory was alive with its usual morning chaos.

Iida Tenya stood near the kitchen counter, chopping vegetables with mechanical precision for his morning salad. ""It is precisely 6:47 AM! Everyone should be completing their morning routines with efficiency and purpose!""

Uraraka Ochaco yawned from the couch, still in her pajamas, her hair a fluffy disaster. ""Iida-kun... it's Saturday...""

""Saturday is no excuse for disorder!""

Midoriya Izuku sat at the dining table, scribbling furiously in his notebook, muttering under his breath. ""—if I adjust the trajectory of my Black Whip by approximately twelve degrees and combine it with a feint using Float, I could theoretically—""

""Deku, you're doing it again,"" Asui Tsuyu said flatly from across the table, sipping her tea. ""Kero.""

""S-Sorry, Asui-san!""

""I told you to call me Tsu.""

Bakugo Katsuki stormed into the kitchen, shoving Iida aside to get to the coffee machine. ""Move it, Four-Eyes.""

""Bakugo! That is incredibly rude and—""

""I said MOVE.""

Kirishima Eijiro followed behind him, grinning broadly. ""Morning, everyone! Bakugo's just cranky because I beat him in arm wrestling last night.""

""YOU DID NOT! I LET YOU WIN BECAUSE I WAS TIRED!""

""Sure, bro. Sure.""

Todoroki Shoto entered the room silently, already fully dressed, his expression as neutral as always. He opened the refrigerator, stared at its contents for a solid thirty seconds, and then closed it without taking anything.

""Todoroki-kun? Are you okay?"" Yaoyorozu Momo asked from the couch, where she was reading a thick novel.

""I forgot what I wanted,"" he said simply, and sat down at the table.

Kaminari Denki slid down the staircase railing, landing with a dramatic flourish. ""Good MORNING, beautiful people! Anyone seen Mineta? He wasn't in his room.""

Jiro Kyoka pulled out one of her earphone jacks from the wall, where she'd been idly listening to music through the building's structure. ""Probably doing something perverted.""

""That's not fair, Jiro,"" Sero Hanta said, walking in while brushing his teeth. He paused. ""Actually, yeah, it's probably fair.""

Ashido Mina bounced into the room, pink skin practically glowing with energy. ""Guys, guys, guys! I just saw Mineta outside and he looks SUPER weird!""

Everyone turned to look at her.

""Weird how?"" Ojiro Mashirao asked, his tail swishing curiously behind him.

""Like... *pale* weird. And he was just standing in the courtyard staring at the sky. Not moving. Not being a creep. Just... standing there.""

""Mineta? Not being a creep?"" Kaminari raised an eyebrow. ""That IS weird.""

Hagakure Toru's floating pajamas gestured wildly. ""Maybe he's sick! Should we check on him?""

""Perhaps we should,"" Iida declared, adjusting his glasses. ""As his classmates, it is our duty to ensure his wellbeing, even if his behavior is often... questionable.""

Bakugo took a long sip of his coffee. ""Don't care.""

""Nobody asked you, Kacchan,"" Midoriya murmured under his breath.

""WHAT WAS THAT, DEKU?!""

""Nothing!""

---

The Courtyard

---

They found him exactly where Ashido had described — standing in the middle of the courtyard, face tilted toward the morning sun. His eyes were closed, his arms hung loosely at his sides, and his signature purple ball-hair seemed... different. Darker, somehow. More voluminous. And his skin — normally a healthy tan — was now a stark, porcelain white.

But the most striking change was his *presence*. There was something about the way he stood — utterly still, utterly calm — that was profoundly un-Mineta.

""Mineta-kun?"" Midoriya approached cautiously. ""Are you alright? You didn't come back to the dorm last night.""

Mineta's eyes opened.

They were *red*.

Not the red of irritation or exhaustion. A deep, luminous crimson, like wine held up to candlelight.

""Midoriya,"" Mineta said. His voice was... deeper. Smoother. It carried an odd resonance, as though two voices were speaking in near-perfect unison. ""Good morning.""

Midoriya stopped in his tracks. ""Y-Your eyes...""

""Hm?"" Mineta blinked, then touched his own face. ""Oh. Right. Yeah, that happened.""

""WHAT happened?!"" Ashido demanded, leaning in close. ""Dude, you look like a vampire!""

Silence.

Mineta looked at her. Slowly, deliberately, he smiled.

His canine teeth were *long*. Sharp. They extended past his lower lip like elegant daggers.

""Funny you should say that,"" he said.

The silence that followed was deafening.

Then Kaminari burst out laughing. ""Okay, very funny, bro. What is this, a costume? Did Hatsume make you some kind of—""

""It's not a costume."" Mineta opened his mouth wider, and everyone could see — the fangs weren't prosthetics. They were seamlessly integrated into his gums, gleaming and very, very real. ""I got bit by something last night. Some kind of... old thing. A real vampire, I think. And then it turned to dust.""

""Kero,"" Tsuyu said, her finger on her chin. ""You're saying you were bitten by a vampire and now you've become one?""

""That's... yeah. That's what I'm saying.""

""But you're standing in sunlight,"" Todoroki observed, his heterochromatic eyes narrowing analytically. ""Vampires are destroyed by sunlight.""

Mineta looked up at the sun, then back at Todoroki. ""Yeah, I noticed. It feels... warm. Nice, actually. Better than it used to."" He flexed his small fingers, staring at them. ""Everything feels different. I can hear your heartbeats. All of you. Midoriya's is fast — you're nervous. Bakugo's is steady and strong, like a war drum. Todoroki, yours is... weirdly calm. And Ashido—""

""Okay, that's creepy, stop,"" Ashido said, taking a step back.

""I can also smell your blood,"" Mineta added, almost conversationally.

Everyone took a step back.

""And?"" Bakugo stepped forward, palms already sparking. ""You gonna try something, Grape Freak?""

Mineta looked at Bakugo. For the first time anyone could remember, he didn't flinch. He didn't cower. He met Bakugo's explosive glare with an eerie, composed steadiness.

""No,"" Mineta said quietly. ""I don't want to hurt anyone. But I won't lie — you all smell... incredible.""

""We need to tell Aizawa-sensei,"" Iida said immediately, his hand chopping the air with urgency. ""This is clearly a medical and potentially security-related issue! We cannot handle this alone!""

""For once, I agree with the robot,"" Bakugo growled, not taking his eyes off Mineta.

""I'm not a robot, Bakugo!""

---

**U.A. Faculty Office — Twenty Minutes Later**

---

Aizawa Shouta stared at Mineta from behind his desk, his capture weapon coiled loosely around his neck, his bloodshot eyes even more tired than usual. Which was saying something.

""Say that again,"" Aizawa said.

""I was bitten by a vampire,"" Mineta repeated, sitting in a chair that his feet didn't quite reach the floor from — though he somehow managed to make even that look dignified now. ""Last night. In the alley between Support Building C and the east lawn. It turned to dust after biting me. And now I'm... this.""

Present Mic, leaning against the doorframe, lowered his sunglasses. ""Yo, Shouta, are we seriously entertaining this?""

""Look at his eyes, Yamada.""

Present Mic looked. His ever-present grin faltered. ""...Huh.""

""I've already contacted Recovery Girl,"" Aizawa continued, rubbing his temples. ""She'll examine you. In the meantime—"" He activated his Quirk. His hair floated upward, and his eyes glowed red as Erasure took hold.

Nothing happened to Mineta.

The fangs remained. The crimson eyes remained. The pale skin remained.

Aizawa's eyes widened — one of the few times his students had ever seen genuine surprise on his face. ""It's not a Quirk.""

""What?"" Midoriya, who had insisted on coming along with Iida, leaned forward from where he stood near the door.

""My Erasure has no effect,"" Aizawa said slowly, letting his Quirk deactivate. ""Whatever this is... it's not Quirk-based. It's something else entirely.""

The room went very quiet.

""So it's real,"" Iida whispered. ""Mineta has genuinely become a vampire.""

""A Dracula!"" Present Mic corrected, his voice pitched with a mixture of excitement and horror. ""Like, a real, actual, fangs-and-capes DRACULA!""

""I don't have a cape,"" Mineta noted.

""We can fix that,"" Present Mic said immediately.

""Yamada, not helpful,"" Aizawa snapped. He turned back to Mineta. ""Can you still use your Quirk?""

Mineta reached up and plucked one of the balls from his head. It popped off cleanly, sticky as ever. But the ball was darker now — a deep, almost black purple — and when he stuck it to the desk, Aizawa had to use considerable force to pull his hand free after accidentally touching it.

""Stronger,"" Aizawa observed, examining the residue on his fingers. ""Your Pop Off has been enhanced.""

""That's not all."" Mineta hopped off the chair — and kept going *up*. He floated, suspended in midair, his small body hovering a foot off the ground. His classmates' jaws dropped.

""I can fly,"" Mineta said, with the calm certainty of someone describing the weather. ""I figured that out this morning. I can also do... this.""

He looked at the pencil cup on Aizawa's desk. His crimson eyes pulsed, and the cup slid three inches to the left without being touched.

""Telekinesis?"" Midoriya's muttering kicked into overdrive. ""Flight, enhanced physical abilities, heightened senses, telekinesis — this matches the classical vampire mythology almost perfectly, but the sunlight immunity is a major deviation. Could it be related to his Quirk factor somehow interacting with the vampiric transformation? If the grape-based biological composition of his Quirk provides some kind of—""

""Midoriya,"" Aizawa said.

""—natural UV resistance due to the anthocyanin compounds present in grape pigmentation, which are known to absorb ultraviolet light, then theoretically—""

""*Midoriya.*""

""S-Sorry!""

Aizawa sighed — a deep, bone-weary sigh that seemed to add another year to his already exhausted face. ""I'm calling Nezu. And All Might. And probably Thirteen and Ectoplasm for good measure. Until we understand what's happened, Mineta, you're not to bite anyone. Understood?""

""I wasn't planning to,"" Mineta said. But then he paused, and a flicker of his old self surfaced — that sly, calculating look that every girl in Class 1-A knew and dreaded. ""Although... I have to say... becoming a creature of the night has done wonders for my confidence. Ladies—""

""Don't,"" Aizawa said.

""—I'm just saying, vampires are traditionally seen as very romantic and seductive figures in literature, and I think—""

""*Don't.*""

Jiro, who had followed the group despite not being invited, jabbed one of her earphone jacks into the doorframe. ""If he tries the 'sexy vampire' thing, I'm staking him. I don't care if it's illegal.""

""Noted and approved,"" Aizawa said.

 **Recovery Girl's Office — One Hour Later**

---

Recovery Girl — Shuzenji Chiyo — had seen a great many things in her decades at U.A. She had healed broken bones, restored torn muscles, mended injuries that would have been career-ending for lesser heroes. She had treated All Might himself on multiple occasions.

She had never treated a vampire.

""Remarkable,"" she murmured, peering at the blood sample under her microscope. ""Your red blood cells have fundamentally altered. They're... consuming the plasma around them and reproducing at an extraordinary rate. Your hemoglobin has tripled. And there's a compound I don't recognize — something that seems to be generating its own energy independent of cellular respiration.""

""What does that mean in normal words?"" Mineta asked from the examination table.

""It means your body no longer functions like a human body,"" Recovery Girl said bluntly. ""You're alive, but the mechanism keeping you alive has changed. Your heart beats, but it beats slowly — roughly twenty beats per minute. Your body temperature is significantly lower than normal. And your cells are regenerating at a rate I've never seen outside of certain regeneration Quirks.""

She turned to face him, her expression grave. ""Mineta, dear. Do you feel the need to... drink blood?""

Mineta was quiet for a moment. Everyone in the room — Aizawa, All Might (in his deflated form), Midoriya, and Recovery Girl — waited.

""...Yes,"" he admitted, and his voice was small. For a moment, he sounded like the old Mineta — the scared, insecure boy who cried in the face of danger. ""I can feel it. It's like... being thirsty, but worse. Like every cell in my body is asking for something that water can't fix. But I don't *want* to hurt anyone. I'm trying to ignore it.""

All Might — Toshinori Yagi — stepped forward. Even in his skeletal, diminished form, there was a warmth to him that filled the room. He placed a bony hand on Mineta's shoulder.

""Young Mineta,"" he said, and his sunken blue eyes were kind. ""A hero is not defined by what they are, but by what they choose to do. You have been given a frightening power without your consent. But the fact that you are choosing to resist your urges — that is heroic.""

Mineta looked up at him. For a moment, his crimson eyes glistened.

""...Thanks, All Might.""

""However,"" Aizawa cut in, practical as ever, ""we need a solution. You can't just ignore a biological imperative indefinitely. Recovery Girl, is there a substitute?""

Recovery Girl tapped her cane thoughtfully. ""Blood transfusion bags, perhaps. We have a supply for medical emergencies. If his body can accept donated blood rather than requiring it fresh from a living source—""

""Let's try it,"" Mineta said quickly. ""Please.""

Recovery Girl retrieved a bag of O-negative blood from the medical refrigerator. She poured a small amount into a cup and handed it to Mineta.

Everyone watched.

Mineta stared at the dark red liquid. His nostrils flared. His pupils dilated until the crimson of his irises was nearly eclipsed. His fangs extended slightly.

He drank.

The effect was immediate. Color returned to his cheeks — not a healthy tan, but a faint, rosy warmth. The dark circles under his eyes faded. The tension in his small frame released, and he let out a shuddering breath.

""How do you feel?"" Recovery Girl asked.

""Like I just drank the best grape soda of my life,"" Mineta said. ""Times a thousand.""

""It works,"" Aizawa said, and there was visible relief in his voice, though he'd never admit it. ""We can supply you with donated blood. But this stays contained. The last thing we need is a media circus.""

""Too late for that, probably,"" came a cheerful voice from the doorway.

Everyone turned. Principal Nezu stood there — small, white-furred, beady-eyed, and smiling with the unnerving intelligence that made him the most dangerous mind in U.A.

""I've been monitoring the situation through the security cameras,"" Nezu said pleasantly, hopping onto a stool. ""Fascinating. Truly fascinating. A genuine vampiric transformation — non-Quirk in origin, resistant to Erasure, and compatible with sunlight exposure. This is, to my knowledge, unprecedented in recorded history.""

He took a sip of tea from a cup that seemed to have materialized from nowhere.

""I've already contacted several experts, including Professor Kurogiri's former research associate at the Paranormal Studies Institute — before his unfortunate villainy, of course — and the consensus is that we are dealing with something very old. Older than Quirks. Older, perhaps, than recorded history.""

""Are you saying vampires have always existed?"" Midoriya asked, his notebook already full of frantic scrawling.

""I'm saying,"" Nezu replied, his smile widening, ""that the world is far stranger than even the age of Quirks has led us to believe. And young Mineta here may have just become a bridge between the known and the unknown.""

Mineta swallowed hard. ""I just wanted to buy grape soda.""

""Yes, well,"" Nezu said, ""the universe rarely consults us about its plans.""

 **Heights Alliance — That Evening**

---

Word spread fast.

By dinner, every student in Class 1-A was gathered in the common room. They had pushed the couches and tables into a rough semicircle, and Mineta stood — or rather, hovered slightly — at the center, arms crossed, looking deeply uncomfortable under the scrutiny of nineteen pairs of eyes.

""So,"" Tokoyami Fumikage said, Dark Shadow peering over his shoulder with undisguised fascination, ""you have joined the ranks of the creatures of darkness. I must say... I am impressed.""

""Thanks, Tokoyami. I think.""

""Dark Shadow and I welcome you to the shadows.""

Dark Shadow gave a thumbs up. **""COOL FANGS, BRO.""**

""Can you turn into a bat?"" Koda Koji signed shyly, his eyes wide with an animal lover's curiosity.

Mineta blinked. ""I... don't know. I haven't tried.""

""Try it!"" Hagakure urged, her invisible form bouncing with excitement.

Mineta closed his eyes. He concentrated. His brow furrowed. His body began to shimmer — and then, with a sound like a deck of cards being shuffled, he *collapsed* inward. His form compressed, twisted, darkened, and where a short purple-haired boy had stood, a small bat with purple-tinged fur and bright crimson eyes now fluttered in the air.

""AHHAshido screamed in delight. ""HE'S SO TINY AND CUTE!""

Bat-Mineta swooped around the room, performed a loop, and then transformed back, landing on the coffee table in a crouch. His clothes had survived the transformation — a detail that made everyone breathe a sigh of relief.

""That was awesome,"" Kirishima said, eyes shining. ""So manly!""

""Tch."" Bakugo looked away, but his palms weren't sparking. That was as close to acceptance as he ever got.

Shoji Mezo leaned forward, his multiple arms folded thoughtfully. ""Can you control minds? In the legends, Dracula could mesmerize people.""

""Oh no,"" Jiro said immediately. ""Oh no no no. If this pervert gets mind control—""

""I don't know if I can!"" Mineta said quickly, raising his hands defensively. ""And even if I could, I wouldn't use it like that!""

""You absolutely would,"" Jiro said.

""Old Mineta might have,"" Mineta said, and something in his voice made everyone pause. He looked down at his hands — pale, clawed slightly at the tips now. ""But... I don't know. Something's different. Not just the powers. It's like... the transformation burned away some of the noise in my head. The constant panic, the insecurity. I can think clearly for the first time in my life. And I know — I know — that the way I acted before wasn't okay.""

The room was utterly silent.

""I was scared all the time,"" he continued, quietly. ""Scared I wasn't good enough, scared I'd wash out, scared that nobody would ever take me seriously. And I dealt with that fear in the worst possible way. I was gross. I was a creep. And I'm sorry.""

Yaoyorozu's eyes softened. ""Mineta...""

""I'm not saying becoming a vampire fixed me or whatever. I'm still me. But I have a chance to be better, and I don't want to waste it."" He looked up, crimson eyes sweeping across his classmates. ""So... yeah. That's where I am.""

Tsuyu was the first to speak. ""Kero. I accept your apology, Mineta-chan. But if you peep on the girls' side of the hot spring again, I will personally drag you to the bottom of a lake. Vampire or not.""

""Fair.""

Uraraka smiled warmly. ""I think it's really brave of you to say all that, Mineta-kun.""

Sato Rikido nodded, arms crossed. ""Yeah, man. Takes guts.""

""Do vampires even have guts?"" Kaminari wondered aloud.

""I still have guts,"" Mineta confirmed. ""I think.""

Aoyama Yuga, who had been strangely quiet, suddenly sparkled — literally. His belt gleamed as he struck a pose. ""A vampire who walks in the sunlight... how magnifique! You are like me — a being who shines too brightly for this world to contain! ✨""

""I'm... not sure that's the same thing, Aoyama.""

""It is exactly the same thing.""

Ojiro scratched his cheek. ""So what happens now? With class, with hero training...?""

""Aizawa-sensei said I can continue attending class,"" Mineta said. ""Nezu wants to study the transformation, but he also said there's no reason I can't keep training. My Quirk still works — it's actually stronger now. And the vampire abilities on top of that...""

""You might actually become a decent hero,"" Bakugo said bluntly.

Everyone stared at him.

""What? I said decent. Don't make it weird.""

Midoriya smiled. ""I think what Kacchan means is—""

""I SAID WHAT I MEANT, DEKU.""
Meanwhile — U.A. Support Course Lab
Hatsume Mei was vibrating.

Not metaphorically. She had attached a small motor to her chair because she believed micro-vibrations improved creative thinking (Power Loader had given up trying to argue with her about safety), and the device was currently set to its highest frequency as she stared at the data packet Nezu had sent her.

""A VAMPIRE!"" she shouted to no one in particular, since the lab was empty at this hour. ""A REAL, ACTUAL VAMPIRE! Do you know what this means?!""

Her crosshair eyes zoomed in on the blood analysis. ""New support gear! Vampire-compatible hero equipment! Blood storage integration systems! Bat-form aerodynamic enhancement rigs! I could build a CAPE with STRUCTURAL SUPPORT for aerial combat! This is the greatest day of my LIFE!""

She grabbed her welding torch and a sheet of titanium alloy.

""MINETA-KUN! YOU'RE GOING TO BE MY GREATEST BABY YET!""

In the distance, Power Loader felt a chill run down his spine and didn't know why.

Rooftop of Heights Alliance — Midnight
Mineta sat on the edge of the roof, legs dangling over the side. The moon was full and heavy above him, painting the campus in silver light. He could see everything — every blade of grass, every insect crawling along the distant tree line, every security camera rotating on its mount. He could hear the heartbeats of his sleeping classmates below him, a soft symphony of life that was simultaneously beautiful and terrifying.

He was thirsty again.

He pulled out the small thermos Recovery Girl had given him — filled with donated blood, kept at body temperature by a heating element Aizawa had requisitioned from the support department. He took a careful sip.

""Can't sleep either?""

Mineta nearly fell off the roof. He caught himself — floating instinctively — and turned to see Shinsou Hitoshi climbing through the rooftop access door, hands in his pockets, purple hair wild as ever, dark circles under his eyes rivaling Aizawa's.

""Shinsou?"" Mineta blinked. ""What are you doing here? You're not even in our dorm.""

""Aizawa-sensei told me what happened. I was curious."" Shinsou sat down beside him, leaving a comfortable distance between them. ""A vampire, huh? And I thought my Quirk got me called a villain.""

Mineta snorted. ""At least your Quirk doesn't come with a craving for human blood.""

""No, but it comes with everyone assuming I want to control their minds for evil."" Shinsou shrugged. ""People fear what they don't understand. You're going to get a lot of that.""

""I already do. I'm the 'pervy grape kid.' Now I'll be the 'pervy grape vampire kid.'""

""So change the narrative."" Shinsou's tired eyes met Mineta's crimson ones. ""You've got the power now. More than you ever had. Use it right, and people will have to take you seriously whether they want to or not.""

Mineta was quiet for a long moment.

""You know,"" he said slowly, ""you might be the first person who's talked to me like a normal person today. Everyone else either screamed, stared, or threatened to stake me.""

Shinsou's mouth twitched — almost a smile. ""Welcome to the 'creepy Quirk' club. Meetings are Thursdays.""

""I'll bring the blood bags.""

""Please don't.""They sat in comfortable silence, watching the moon drift across the sky. Below them, U.A. slept, unaware that one of its students had become something the world hadn't seen in centuries — or perhaps ever.

And somewhere, in the deep places of the earth where sunlight had never reached, something ancient stirred. It felt the death of one of its children. It felt the birth of another.

And it was hungry.

1r8qo2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/90DayKorean/comments/1r8qo2v/stop_using_romanization_its_actually_holding_your/,Stop using Romanization: it’s actually holding your Korean back,"A common mistake we see people make when they start learning Korean is clinging to English letters to read the words. It feels like a safe bet early on, but it’s actually a trap that ruins your pronunciation and slows you down in the long run. Romanization is just a rough guess at the sound, so if you want to actually sound natural, you have to move to Hangul as fast as possible.

The good news is that the Korean alphabet is probably the most logical writing system ever designed. It was literally made so that anyone could learn it in a single afternoon. One of the coolest things is that the letters aren't just random shapes. They’re **featural**, which means they actually mimic your mouth and tongue. For example, **ㄴ** looks like your tongue hitting the roof of your mouth for that ""N"" sound, and **ㅁ** is a box because it looks like closed lips for the ""M"" sound. 

To make it stick, we always recommend using visual associations. Instead of memorizing lines, try seeing **ㅂ** as a **B**ed or **ㄱ** as a **G**un.

[Consonant Association - ㅂ for bed, ㄱ for gun](https://preview.redd.it/fmvy1fvdydkg1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e6c9febd0850d661ba435a3031d377cf060928a)

For vowels, we use a simple clockwise trick called ""Old Father, New Son."" Just remember **ㅗ** is **O**ld (oh), **ㅏ** is F**a**ther (ah), **ㅜ** is N**ew** (oo), and **ㅓ** is S**o**n (aw).

[Vowel Association - \\""Old Father New Son\\""](https://preview.redd.it/wn1h1gxmwdkg1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c23d31b5ab334f7be3df49fdd6d90cb05db56dea)

Once you have those down, you just add a tiny extra stroke to turn them into ""Y"" sounds like **ㅑ** (ya) or **ㅛ** (yo).

The part that usually trips people up is how the letters are stacked. In English, we write in a flat line, but Korean uses **syllable blocks.** You always read them from left to right and top to bottom. Each syllable block must start with a consonant followed by a vowel, and an optional final consonant. If you see a circle **ㅇ** at the start of a block, it’s a silent placeholder that fills the initial consonant position. If it’s at the bottom of a block, it makes an ""ng"" sound. It’s like a little puzzle that once you ""see,"" you can't unsee.

Honestly, the best way to learn this isn't by staring at a boring chart for hours. It's just by sounding out real words and getting used to the ""box"" rule. Most of our students can read their first nine words, like **차** (car/tea) or **커피** (coffee), in under an hour just by using these mental shortcuts.

Along with the usual café setup, planning to have things like:

• board games

• a small reading corner / books

• pottery or art workshops

• open mics / small community events

• maybe other hobby based sessions as well

I started panicking a bit, where did he go!? He has to be in there. My eyes scanned the bottom of his enclosure before working their way up. He was right there in front of me on his tree wondering what all the fuss was about! 😂

She came to visit me, we got close and eventually after a few visits, she moved in. 

We both needed it, she had just gotten fired for discriminatory reasons. I was sick and she helped take care of me and due to a settlement from my late mother I could sustain us for a while. I helped her heal mentally which was hard because she relied on basically no one else, had no support network. I would get burned out mentally every 3 months or so, beg her to connect with people so they could be her support network then get burnt out again. 

I was weak with a disease that if I exerted myself too much I would collapse. For a month. So anytime I would have a 5 honor therapy session with her, that came with incredible risk.  I loved her and she helped take care of me but it took a year for her ti find one friend, a friend that would ditch her a month later, leaving me in the same situation. She thought making friends was impossible I don't think she wanted to impose but it was burning me out constantly and I was begging her to if not another friend, another partner so she could get support that wasn't all on my shoulders. She had some short lived bad relationships that went to me once again being the only person she relied on. I got her a therapist around 3 months into our relationship but I was the person she was venting to most nights. And when I would tell her I couldn't handle anymore, she would break down and hide in the other room. 

It was hard but I wanted to hang in there. Fast forward to 2024 and the political climate is getting dangerous for queers in a red state. We decide we have to move. She does get most of our stuff ready, and have her dad help move us out of state. She pays for a decent chunk of the love but not all of it. I had still paid for a lot of the move as I had paid for almost everything up to that point. When I ran low on funds I had to sell future settlement payments to keep us afloat. It was hard and heartbreaking but I didn't see another option. She was incredibly mentally disabled. 

That fall my body collapsed and I was very weak. She still tried to vent at me. I told her I couldn't handle emotional subjects. She took this making I never wanted her to talk to me about her emotions ever again which wasn't the case at all. She was also making my collapse about her and how she felt alone and isolated, something I had tried to alleviate previously by having her seek out friends but she never really made any connections. So I basically hid how bad I was and then slowly recovered. 

I'm primarily a submissive so I was seeking a domme around this time and looking into whatever avenues I could for when my money ran out. We would have sex where I would be the bottom. My girlfriend above wanted sex as well but where I was the top as her mommy domme. That was difficult to say the least when I was weak. Still I tried to schedule sex so I could plan my energy around it an idea she categorically rejected. So we didn't have a lot of sex which honestly didn't bother me that much since of all the times we had sex I orgasmed once and that was when I was directing it. She was jealous of my domme but I just dealt with it. 

We moved and my health got a lot better. I used that to go on outings, plan things for us to do and try to enjoy life. But she with the defense that ""she didn't know what I could do anymore"" decided that she would not plan any outings. At all. For years we had talked about what we would do when I got better. And then I got sizably better but not totally and threw myself into my recovery and she seemingly wasn't interested. I still planned things and tried to spend time with her, but she was interested in a life that had long been denied being around other queer people at bars and such. She would have fun and tell me about it and I was happy for her. She found another partner she liked and I was thrilled she was happy. 

I organized places for all of us to go and enjoy things that I could do but once again, that was just me. I'm left to wonder how much of her going from knowing my health so well to assuming I didn't want to do things or go out was because of her partner who has a family member recover in ways I didn't from this disease, but she became slowly more and more distant. She would make time for others but we would spend a night together a week then two weeks then a month. I felt a longing for what we had and the closeness. I wanted time with her and she didn't seem to understand that. She brought other people to the first night that was supposed to be our night and I was hurt. I thought I had made my wants pretty clear. We would eventually do the once a week time but it would hurt to still see her spend so much time with others but I had to beg for a night a week. 

We had a lot going on in our lives and she would help around the house as she used to. She would complain about the work required, I would suggest an alternative which would mean someone else less proficient would pick up the slack, she would reject it and then continue to be upset. I helped how I could but I was limited to say the least. 

She would get upset I would spend days on YouTube. What I tried to explain is that I have activity days and rest days. If I don't rest I don't get activity days and I get worse, classic chronic fatigue stuff. It was around this time she started saying she thought that I was better than I was and that she wanted a normal relationship. That hurt. It was pretty clear to me that I would never have a normal relationship because of my disabilities. I had supported her mentally and financially but that didn't seem to be enough. 

My money was running low and  found something that could substantially boost my health but it would cost me over a months living expenses. I decided against it after I asked my father for help and he essentially said under no circumstances would he offer a penny. Not surprising. I asked him for help previously when I was very sick to stay with him, he said he'd rather send me to a nursing home. I asked for a loan so I wouldn't have to sell part of his late wife's settlement money which he had previously described as ""sacred"" and he refused. 

I approached my girlfriend and let her know the news. She told me to go with her procedure anyways as it was the best chance of me getting better. I described my hesitancy at doing so as I didn't know how much it would incapacitate me. She said she would take care of me like old times. Well, that would turn out to be incredibly false. I get the procedure my neck is so stiff it effectively can't move in any direction. We're walking to her other gf her ride and my phone is dead and hers dies. She flips out and demands I go find a place with a charging cable to charge her phone. For context I just got stabbed in the neck nearly 50 times without anything besides nerve blocks. I eschewed anesthesia to save us $300. I was in a lot of pain and quite weak. 

It didn't matter though. I tried to go find someone, my body about gave out and I returned empty handed. She didn't seem to understand what she had requested was incredibly out of character and reasonable. She had gotten a colonoscopy a few weeks previous where I was there the entire time she had the prep, the procedure and gave her coffee when she woke up. I appreciate she waited during my procedure which was admittedly long but it didn't feel that caring. She wouldn't really check in on me and when I was doing better than expected, she assumed I was essentially fine. We hosted  brunch for friends. I had communicated in no uncertain terms that I was weak and wouldn't be able to ask people to leave, it may be possible that being upright might not even be an option. She didn't make sure people left and I got scared. 

I yelled at her and said I didn't understand we had a deal. I got the procedure because of her promise and that hasn't happened. And I was at risk when people were over. I invited them over with her permission because I was in so much pain I wanted a distraction but she didn't hold up her side of the deal. I told her that she was endangering my health and if she continues to do so we'd have to break up. She took that badly. 

She would later explain how she took the off hand desperate comment from a year ago that I couldn't handle emotional subjects to mean I never wanted to hear about her struggles. I realized that I had not had heard as much of her mental struggles but mostly her frustrations with the world. 

We tried to do better and go from there. I had an event I wanted to do together. I told her months in advance. It was on the same day but after brunch where she would be mostly cooking. In hindsight we should have canceled that brunch but I didn't think about it then. I reminded her multiple times during the brunch about the event. Then she went down to wish another one of her partners goodbye and then would come up. I waited 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, ok this is getting absurd. I grab her phone and prepare to go down. 30 minutes. I go down and as I walk out the door I se me her walking in the other direction with her partner. I feel betrayed. I had made it clear that I wanted to spend time with her and had set this up for months. 

So I went to the event myself. I was incredibly sad. 45 minutes I would get a message from a friend saying she had come back and was confused. We were sharing keys at the time and I had the only set so she couldn't get in. I told her coldly I'd be back later. I needed to cool down. I was hurt, I felt forgotten and I needed space. I would come back around 2 hours later. She would fall apart about being locked out of the apartment and was in tears. I shouldn't have done that for sure but in the moment I was so hurt I rationalized I needed space. 

She would go to her other partners for a few days she came back and we cried. We tried to be there for each other a bit more and things were better. I told her around December I had funds to pay for rent through February. She was very upset. She saw doing housework as a job I was compensating her for and I was renegading on the deal. I was trying to have a dialogue. She was supposed to get disability but that fell through. I tried to establish a plan of how to go forward with the income we had and she was really not ok with being as poor as we would be. 

A few conversations later of me trying to discuss my feelings and she would get upset and bounce to her much wealthier partners house. I was hurt and sad. I had invested so much time, energy and money into this relationship. 

She would come back and say something that really didn't make sense.  She didn't want sex with me which fine that's her choice we were already not doing much of that as said above. She would move to her other partners house but still expect the same love and care on my end for her. She said she would help marginally fund the residence that was our apartment but that like many promises didn't materialize. 

So now that's where I'm at. I spend most of the time in my residence alone occasionally get messages and times where she wants to come over but it feels incredibly one sided. I would like to save this relationship if she's willing and we're in couples therapy now but like I got very ill this week and she didn't even reach out about it. I feel like my apartment is a place she can occasionally stay at and keep her stuff but it doesn't feel like she wants me, she wants a replacement Mom. As long as I fill that role, that seems to be all she wants. The life we built feels so pointless. I feel like she talks to me out of convenience. But the connection I felt for her is slipping away and I don't know if there is any reason to keep pursuing this. 

We were so close, we were there during each other's hardest times but now I feel a lot of hurt. What would you do if you were in my situation?",1,1771477610.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/N5QIYYbn9W): **January 14, 2026**

This is weird so I need to know if I'm crazy for going as far as I did.

I have a condition of chronic pain. The way I explain it to people without chronic pain is that if pain were on levels from 1 to 10, normal people are at most at a 2 or 3 from day to day where people with CP are at more like a 6. Like imagine stepping on a Lego or hitting your funny bone, that's a very brief but excruciating 8. It's like if you pulled a muscle and so there's pain and discomfort if you move it, but pretty much daily. Some days I am higher on the scale, rare blessed days I'm more a 4 or by some miracle lower.

Overall I am active and operate well. I do own canes, but I only use them on days when I'm 7 or above. Such a day came this past Sunday.

On top of my full time job, I have a part time. Due to being physically and legally disabled, I had all the paperwork already filed with my job in case I ever need accommodations. I have a handicap marker on my license plate and the placard on my rear view mirror and the works.

I was recently moved to a location closer to my home. I love my new team. My boss Amy is really great. My colleague Casey and I get along okay but were the same position as assistant coordinators to Amy. The reason I was moved to that location was that it expanded and they needed more hands so they added me.

Casey has wanted a promotion for a long time and everyone knows it. I was pretty open that I don't. Lol any promotion from my position would be a full-time and...I already have a full-time job. I do *this* job to pad my savings and because I frankly like the job. Being busy also helps with my anxiety.

I mean Casey works hard but she also likes to talk over me or rush to take charge of something before I can when I clearly was getting to it. She then announces it. ""Oh I handled that for you, OP. Don't worry!"" And at first I was annoyed but over time I was like alright then, but you didn't have to. I talked to Amy about this. I want to pull my weight but it can be challenging and redundant when Casey is racing to beat me to it. The point was for us to split tasks evenly. Amy said she would talk to her and I don't know what came of that but things didn't really change much so I just accepted it.

So when I came in Monday with my cane, everyone had questions. I emailed Amy Sunday night so she knew but I tend to be private so what I told everyone else was that I have a condition and sometimes I need a cane but not always.

Amy accommodated me. She assigned me tasks that required little to no movement. I was very grateful and got everything done pretty early so I called over the radio if there was anything else I could do. Casey said no she's got it so I just handled admin stuff that's usually on the backburner. Literally replied with ""okay I'll tackle the admin list then"" and Casey said no she's got it but Amy followed that with a thank you to me and confirmation that this would be helpful.

I still needed my cane yesterday (Tuesday) and it was similar. I completed most of the admin to-dos and Amy was so relieved to have it done. She thanked me for coming in and doing all that instead of calling out. Casey made a comment that she could've helped but I said that's okay and thanked her for handling the more physical tasks.

We ended up walking to the parking lot together and she asked which car was mine so I pointed at it. Then she said ""so I know you're not disabled, by the way."" And I asked what she meant. She just repeated herself and said ""so no cane tomorrow, okay? I won't tell. Just no cane tomorrow.""

👀.

I stood there like *what the fuck*? But I was meeting my best friend and just left to make it on time. I met my BFF Joy at the bar and we had a wonderful time. I brought my cane but tbh I didn't always use it. For example, I didn't use it to walk from my table to the bar to request another drink or when I got up to hug Joy goodbye.

Today, when I woke up, my pain was higher than my normal so I took my cane along. I texted Amy that I have my cane but doing okay in small bursts so put me in Coach lol I was having a good time at my main job and didn't give Casey a thought.

I arrive at my part time job and Casey saw my cane and went red. I mean like the way I looked when the Eagles lost to the 49ers lol just SUPER MAD. I greeted everyone and she ignored me completely. We got our assignments and she snidely said to me ""Well can you handle that with your cane and all?"" In a tone that even made Amy turn to look at her like WTF. I said I can manage and thanked her for her concern and we went about our work. Once again she raced to beat me to things and saying over the radio ""don't strain yourself, OP, I did x-task or got y-done""

I was so confused until about an hour ago when we finished work she again walked with me to the parking lot but this time showed me a video. It was me. It was me at the bar last night with Joy. I was just like...um why do you have a video of me - that's weird. She says it's proof. I asked of what? And she said it's proof I'm not disabled as I acted so ""wounded all day at work"" but suddenly don't need my cane at a bar.

What???? I wanted to explain that that's just not how CP works. Like yes I can stand up to hug my friend or get up and walk 3 strides to order a new drink but I can't, for example, lean over and organize a bottom drawer without a chair to sit in. I wanted to explain the CP is just an umbrella and under it are a myriad of experiences and abilities and that honestly, if she had left my tasks alone, I'd have done them. She didn't give me the chance and said ""no cane tomorrow. I'm serious. Or I'm going to Chad"" (Chad is Amy's boss).

I said ""About what?"" But she was already walking away from me and just got in her car.

It's just weird. And oddly Chad would know this is bs because his boyfriend has CP too. I'm not so much worried about being ""found out"" or anything but it's just weird and I'm literally typing an email to Amy CCing Chad about this weird behavior because it's just odd. Am I crazy to want to preemptively explain this? I am anxious ans paranoid in general so I don't want to overreact or make things worse.

Edit: I sent the email and also thanks for letting me know I'm not crazy for feeling weirded out.

Also I will be simply blocking anyone who is saying this is fake. I don't have time for your bs to be frank.

I also texted Amy and Chad.

Edit 2: JESUS CHRYSLER DRIVING CHRIST that's a lot of notifications...

I'll edit to try to reply all here because there isn't enough coffee in the world...

It's morning and I'm still about at a 7 and it's cold today so even if I didn't want to bring my cane, I would have to. I texted ahead so Amy can start thinking about tasks today.

For some common themes I've noticed, yeah my pain scale Lego idea wasn't on scale. Stepping on a Lego was the funniest thing I could think of that hurts so I wanted to paint a picture. I wasn't making a clinical pain chart lol feel free to use your own theatre of the mind scenarios to help people without chronic pain have an idea of what it's like.

Also I don't understand the vague ""don't use the term CP"" comments sorry. In this post it means chronic pain. It's within that context 🤷‍♀️ sorry but I just don't get the issue here or of its upsetting...? Idk

Amy and Chad have both responded so we will see how today goes. Anyway this was my first break in my FT job so I have to get back to it.

[Update #1](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/2FX46xyezf): **January 15, 2026 (next day)**

**AIO? My coworker took video of me outside of work to ""prove"" I'm not disabled - Update (Thursday)**

I was asked a lot to [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/vxAhYkRJHQ) when I got off work so here it is. 😬 Today was… weirdly quiet, which almost made it worse. Not sure what everyone knows but they at least know somethings up.

I wasn’t even in the same area as Casey during check-in and I have no clue when she actually arrived. I usually see her as our shifts are the same hours. Turns out she’d been assigned to the back office doing other tasks (hours reduced), while I was put at the admin booth at the entrance handling paperwork and spreadsheets (they definitely took advantage of because I’m good at it 🤣). So we didn’t cross paths at all at first.

I actually turned on a voice recorder app as soon as I got to work, just in case. I also added a shortcut on my phone so I can start recording quickly if I need to just in case. I didn’t wanna be caught off-guard like before. I did feel a little silly doing it, but I’d rather feel silly than unprepared, you know?

I didn’t see Casey until near the end of the shift, and even then it was barely a glimpse. She looked up, saw me, and immediately turned away. Like full on avoidance. It made my stomach drop. I just turned away and minded my business. Amy was very reassuring but also vague at first. I didn't like that and I think my face said so and she said she doesn't like all the red tape and such either but to be patient because they need to go through all the right channels and steps.

Amy let me go home early, but she told me to log my full hours anyway and made it clear she and Chad are actively talking about this and taking it seriously and I am almost certain she and he had been texting the whole shift. She also walked me to my car and said that will continue for now until everything is resolved.

About an hour after my shift ended, I got an email from her (Chad CC'd) saying that tomorrow (Friday), Casey will be assigned to admin duty in the back office unless something changes before the shift, and that we should not be interacting at all. It's a long weekend so I figure all the behind the scenes stuff will be happening then.

I also found out that Casey already “presented her evidence” That includes the video she showed me before and another video from yesterday (Wednesday). Apparently she filmed me at a local winery during Wine Wednesday (there’s a clip of me getting up to grab a bottle a few steps away, and later another clip of me standing up and doing a small little celebratory dance after a tabletop game win).

That’s the part that really messed with my head because hold on when did she start recording me? For how long?

I mean I could maybe believe coincidence once, like, okay lightning struck and its weird. Same town, same general area, blah blah blah. But twice, 2 different days??? Two different places?? That’s when it stopped feeling like my paranoia getting the best of me and started feeling… unsettling. I’m honestly starting to wonder if this is something that might need police involvement, as some comments suggested, and I hate that my brain even went there but I mean what other options are there right now??

I’m typing this from a bar right now, but not the same one as before thank god. It is still local to the school (teachers come here a lot) and it’s Thirsty Thursday, so there’s a bigger happy hour discount if you show your school ID. Joy is with me, and a couple other friends are on their way. Joy had been here during my shift in case I needed any backup fast.

That said, my head is absolutely on a swivel. So is Joy’s. I don’t feel relaxed the way I normally would. I keep scanning the room without meaning to and when people get too close to me or stand in any way facing me I look up to see if it's her. It's fucking weird.

I’m still trying to process all of this, and honestly I’m confused more than anything...I keep going back and forth between “maybe this is nothing” and “this doesn’t feel normal”

Right now I’m just documenting everything and doing what HR tells me to do, but I don’t like how small and watched this situation is starting to feel and I hate that I'm recording every moment I can in case she pops up.

If nothing else, I’m safe tonight and will be staying at Joy's...I’m not alone and work has made sure we’re separated for now. I guess we’ll see what tomorrow brings. So unless something crazy happens o won't be updating until this is resolved.

Wish me luck 🙏.

**Edit:** I just replied to a follow-up email answering some recurring questions HR asked... 

My answers al ended up centered around:

I have never directly or indirectly invited Casey out anywhere. We are not friends outside of work and have never socialized one-on-one.

I was also asked whether I feel safe at work. Right now, yes, because management has taken steps to separate us and has been present and supportive. I've yet to be alone at all at work. I’m continuing to follow their guidance and document everything as instructed.

I’ll update if anything materially changes, but for now I’m letting HR handle it outside making a non-emergency police report in the morning.

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/s/A2PSfBpMTk): **January 23, 2026 (eight days later from the previous update)**

Hey on my phone so sorry for typos

Happy Friday guys. Thanks so much for all the sweet messages checking on me. All things considered I'm okay. My pain spiked pretty badly this past Tuesday, so I took it easy and took off from my fulltime job to pamper myself. That gave me time to think and spend time gaming and gardening. That was a welcome break to brace myself for my part time job. So yes I have been taking care of myself and I loved all the reddit moms (and dads) checking in.

This will be long as I am trying nit forget anything so I can close this out (or at least put a pin in it) as I know for me as a reddit scroller, unfinished stories are almost as frustrating as the ones that go on forever. I’m hoping this is my final update on the matter.

Legal is now involved. I genuinely didn’t even know our organization even had a legal department but apparently it does and they’re looped in alongside HR. An HR rep has been communicating with me but honestly things have been very quiet on that front, which I’m taking as no news is good news.

I’m still at my school and I still love it. I love the students and faculty and even the parents (anyone in education knows parents can be great or they can be soooooo not great lol and rarely is there in between). Casey has been transferred to an admin position at an office in the company I don’t even go to. I haven’t seen her since my last post and I'm glad of it.

Work has been peaceful without her. I have more work to do now as the only assistant coordinator there but I'm starting to get my rhythm and the staff there has been very supportive plus I have more chances to get to know the people I work with.

What I didn’t expect was finding out (from multiple coworkers in several conversations) was that almost from the moment I joined that campus, Casey had been trying to spread rumors about me. Including suggesting that I’m a danger to kids or that I have an “explosive temper” which is honestly wild to hear about myself. I’m almost always described by others as soft-spoken to a fault and usually get told I need to be more strict with students. If anything I balance Amy out as the “good cop” to her “bad cop” plus the angry black woman tropes are sooooo freaking tired, so it was extra annoying to find out that she was trying paint me as such. She also said to people that the reason she took over my tasks was because I did them wrong or Madd her job harder and she had to redo things. She basically had a narrative that I was Mr. Magoo causing chaos and she was the saintly hard working teammate trying to clean up my messes so I don't get in trouble.

HR is still investigating, and I’ve been told to continue documenting anything that comes up. I’m ready to do so but so far it’s been quiet.

One unexpected upside is I’m now the sole person at my campus with my title, which came with a pay raise. Not how I would’ve chosen to get it but I’ll take the win.

I did file a police report - I think I mentioned this in my last post but if not I was told very clearly that filming in public places isn’t illegal and that there’s no reasonable expectation of privacy in those spaces, so there was no criminal action taken (cue my eyeroll but at least its officially reported). The report is strictly documentation. The local places I frequent have been made aware of the situation and that a report exists.

My friends were incredible, they helped me get my car cleaned and detailed just to be absolutely sure there wasn’t anything like a tracker or Air tag like some comments suggested we do. I also finally got around to asking my neighbor to help me install my other security cams. I used to have only one and my doorbell cam and now I can pull up live footage on the whole system all around my house. And to those suggesting a dash cam, I already have one turns out. I never used that feature, so my friends helped. My car is fairly new and I’m still getting used to it.

I did start to go over and backup all footage going back since I started at my campus by motion activation points and now have a hilarious compilation of the neighborhood cats being adorable or the crows I feed leaving random things lol (yes I did the crow mom thing). So another good thing came of this.

I’m not changing my routines... but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t still a little on edge. Especially since multiple coworkers mentioned hearing Casey blow up at Amy on her last day on campus and Amy sent her home for the day (this was on my day off as only Amy and Casey worked MLK day and the coworkers there volunteered to work the holiday for extra pay - time and a half). What she said varies depending on who tells it, but the fact that it happened at all doesn’t exactly make me feel warm and fuzzy as I'm sure you'll understand. But I tell myself everything that can be done on my end, has been done. So I try not to stress about it.

That said, I also reached out to a few lawyers just to understand my options. I’m very aware that HR exists to protect the company not me so I want to cover my bases. I meet one over Zoom at my lunch break so wish me luck.

I still record when I walk to or from my car. My therapist reminded me to be careful to make sure my being proactive doesn’t turn into living in fear and giving in to my anxiety or PTSD (past trauma). I’m taking that seriously as my mental health has been a journey and I don't want to go back to the way I was before. I can’t and won’t let someone else shrink my life again.

I do want to address recurring comments because I can’t reply to everyone individually..

""She goes to bars a lot - drinking is bad!""

Yes, I go to bars. No, that does not mean I drink heavily or have a drinking problem (what a leap!). I mean, look I’m disabled and I socialize within what my body allows and thats an isolating enough experience if I let it be. My friends (mostly able-bodied people) go to bars, so sometimes that’s where I go...

Sometimes I drink, sometimes I don’t...sometimes it’s a mocktail, sometimes it’s soda. I know my body better than strangers on the internet, to be blunt. For what it’s worth, my ex was an alcoholic and he was abusive and spiraled until it ended him so I promise I’m very aware of what that looks like and am probably one of the last people to be overly concerned about on that matter.

""How does she have time to work 2 Jobs and go out? Why wont she just go home""

I do in fact have time to go out after work. I work from home full-time and part-time with the school. If I go straight home after a long day I tend to just… keep working. I’m a workaholic by nature and going out helps me actually relax and not make my entire life about my job. I also intentionally line up PTO with most school holidays to rest and take staycations. This is me managing my health both physical and mental not avoiding reality.

""Don't go anywhere alone, OP""/concerns for my safety

Right now I’m both safe and supported. I’m cautious but I’m still living my life. q I’m choosing not to let this take over my entire world and this is supported by my therapist.

Thank you to the people who offered thoughtful advice and genuine concern ❤️ And to the folks who were weirdly judgmental....well, you must be an absolute blast at parties.

I’m hoping this is my final Update

Edit: the Ice storm woke me up and looked at my phone - Joy and my other friends have a group chat and I think they forgot which chat I’m on with them because they've been trading screenshots of Casey's social media. From what they gathered, Casey did put some of her socials on private in the past day or so but that didn't stop my friends from screenshotting some disturbing posts. In short, Casey has bought into the stereotype that black women especially ""steal from the government"" by leaning on welfare (such an age old and tired racist trope yet again) and other government programs and this included ""faking"" disabilities to ""rip off"" public programs because we clearly don't want to work /s

I did just forward this all on to the HR rep I am in contact with. Turns outs, this probably wasn't about my cane after all. Just plain flavored, canned racism without salt. Frankly how boring is that in my country 😴.

Edit 2: Joy I'd over with homemade Chili and news. No idea what to make of it but Casey is related to a higher up. Looks like a uncle/Neice. That could be another reason legal is involved but we're guessing at this point.

**Editor’s note: Below is the last post we were left off**

[Former coworker filmed me, was fired, and now I’m getting racist notes/messages. what can I actually do?](https://www.reddit.com/user/Ok_Boysenberry_7535): **January 29, 2026 (six days later from the previous date**

Hi, I’m in Texas and honestly just trying to understand what options I have at this point because this seems to just be escalating and I feel like I’m not getting the help I need.

I posted previously in another sub, but things have escalated and people suggested I come here?

To summarize...I work full-time from home and part-time at a school. A coworker at said partime job (who on reddit I’ve been calling Casey) secretly took videos of me outside of work to try to “prove” I was faking a disability.

I reported this to HR first. Legal eventually got involved. She was put on an admin break, then moved to a different office, and as of this week I was told she’s been finally terminated. She has a relative (her stepfather) who works 2nd tier only to our Director, and he's also reached out to apologize stating that she is struggling financially and is a hard worker and thus was very stressed about getting a better paying position. I can copy and paste it below if needed.

There were snow days during part of this (Texas winter storms), so there was a gap where no one was on campus. I was told this delayed me from even logging on to my company email and seeing this info.

What’s happening now is that since she was fired, some really unsettling things have started around the same time. For example on Tuesday the 27th, I found a handwritten note placed on my car while it was parked outside my home. It included a racial slur (“n-b*tch”) and calling em selfish. I quickly checked with neighbors on either side and I was the only one who got a note. I checked my dash cam and moved a camera on my home to cover the area going forward. The footage from my dash only shows someone bundled up approaching the car, but no identifying details. As their face was covered and they were wearing like ski looking goggles.

Wednesday night the 28th,, I went to trivia night with a friend who drove us in her vehicle (she had ""snow tires"" on her vehicle and though the roads in our area were pretty clear we wanted to be cautious). When we came back to her car, there was another note with similar language left on her car! We went back and asked for footage but they said they didn't have cameras that worked out there. No damage to either car and we did double check during daylight just in case.

I’ve also started getting texts from unknown numbers beginning Monday that are hateful or at least pretty scary. I haven’t replied to any of them. I’ve muted the numbers (in case they text again) and saved screenshots for the police...I reported both note incidents and the messages. I was told that filming in public isn’t illegal..leaving a note without damaging property isn’t a crime, and the messages aren’t ""actionable"" unless they escalate???

They did take reports and told me to keep documenting which I fully intend to do.

Casey no longer works for the company. HR/legal are aware of the original situation. I’m documenting everything (dates, screenshots, photos). I have cameras and a dash cam. I’m not fully changing my routines, but I am being cautious.

I think that's pretty much everything...but ask me questions if needed and I will answer. So my questions are:

1) At what point does this become harassment or stalking under Texas law?

2) Is there anything proactive I should be doing now besides documenting?

3) Would a cease and desist make sense, or could that backfire?

4) Is there any civil option here, or is this realistically just “wait and see unless it escalates”?

I’m not trying to overreact...but the pattern is starting to freak me out and I want to make sure I’m handling this the right way and get the help I need to make this stop. I am almost certain it's Casey but without proof I'm not able to get any traction with the cops.

Thanks in advance

#----NEW UPDATE----

**Trigger Warnings:** >!graphic description of panic attack!<

[Update #2](https://www.reddit.com/u/Ok_Boysenberry_7535/s/rkvHbNyE9C): **February 12, 2026 (two weeks later from the previous post)**

So this was canceled by mods on the sub and I respect that so here is the post for any who care:

I'm so sorry I honestly thought my last update was the end but things just keep happening and at this point, reddit is my little safe space. I am at my friends home drinking her wine and lounging in her guest room safe and not alone. I am safe. Thank you everyone who have been asking/checking in on me. I'm ok. Promise. Just stressed.

My life has pretty much become a cartoon, I swear lol and I've become that weirdo who now makes jokes that ride the line of funny and not appropriate but my jokes are about me so I'm giving myself space.

The morning I found the Air Tag in the inside pocket of my cardigan, I went straight to the police. They took it as evidence immediately and for the first time it felt I was being taken seriously. I don’t know the technical details of what happens next, but I was told it was fucking active and they would pursue the account information attached to it.

So yay they're taking this more seriously meets Christ almighty this is so fucking serious. And cue my brain just failing to cope. I had what I was told later to be a panic attack. It was unlike any I've had before. For one, I gained a stutter, and I fully believed it was a heart attack and not a panic attack because my heart felt like it was about to come out of my damn chest. I sat down and my lungs were on fire. It was hell.

A few restless days later, I was informed that Casey had been confronted by police.

I don’t know what was said during that interaction and I haven’t been given many details, but my lawyer said that same evening she was arrested for Public Intoxication and Resisting Arrest. Those charges are public record.

I’m not celebrating that in a petty sense but practical. It just confirmed for me that the instability I was feeling around this situation wasn’t imagined and that unfortunately, right now, her being held by police meant I was safe. It was the first night since this all happened that I was able to sleep

Since that arrest...no notes left anywhere I've found and not texts. Only her relative who works upper management above me who emailed me and said he was sorry this was happening, but it was worded in a way that didn't really say sorry for what she did to me. It was frustrating and political and I just would have preferred he say nothing at all. I didn't respond. I just forwarded to my lawyer.

There hasn’t been any further direct contact. However, something else came to light that forced me to take additional precautions because of course OF COURSE it is never that simple.

Earlier on when I first started there, I had briefly misplaced my keys at work - I was told a student found them and brought them to the office and told they were kind (I have a Totoro charm and a Sailor Venus charm on mine). I was told just recently that a male office staff member handed them to Casey because she claimed she was picking them up for me. I was never informed of that at the time as Amy ultimately handed me my keys.

There is no proof she copied them. But there is no proof she didn’t...and I now live in the better safe than sorry camp.

Given everything that has happened, I can’t ignore the possibility. I’m now changing all of my locks. It’s expensive and frustrating, but I don’t want to live with uncertainty about who has access to my home especially people who are unhinged enough to stalk me. I've been sent enough horror stories. They live rent free in my brain now. So no, I have no intention of being an episode on a show on Investigation Discovery.

My employer has placed me on paid leave until after spring break while everything is sorted out per HR literally this past Monday. I didn’t request it, but I understand the reasoning and am glad of it. They framed it as a safety and liability measure while legal processes continue. Like. Say less. Plus it's no questions asked full scheduled hours pay and my main job is WFH so I've barely left my friend's place. She mainly works from home too and we've just been watching My Hero Academia and Komi Can't Communicate until we run out of episodes and drinking wine at the end of our work hours. She also showed me how to play Dragon Age and Elder Scrolls.

In return since she won't accept money for rent I've been cooking more. I'm actually a bit good, and she's a huge foodie. So we've gotten down cookbooks from her shelves and have been picking our favorites. Last night I made calzones, tonight I'm here on reddit while waiting for my timer after the chicken marinates to make fried chicken and mash potatoes with homemade gravy.

I’m less scared than I was two weeks ago and focusing on things like this and my plans for after. Meanwhile I actually have gotten texts of photos of the students holding banners and cards hoping I come back soon and it does feel nice. Finding the Air Tag was the turning point for me and really sent me into a tizzy. But on the bright (?) Side It made the situation concrete instead of speculative and police took me seriously.

I’m still documenting everything and working with my lawyer. I’m taking this one step at a time. So while I think this for the sake of this ""saga"" on this forum is concluded I will just update on my own account on this if I do at all.

For now, I’m resting. I’m trying to let my nervous system calm down after weeks of being on edge and my therapist said that the cooking, the anime marathons, the binging ""Is it cake?"" At night is all good. I guess I need to level out still before being back to my old normal or...maybe a new equivalent normal. Idk.

I truly hope this is the final update overall. But thank you for the support. It meant and means a lot. It helps when oth3rs tell you that you're not crazy.

Hope your valentine's days are full of love.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/s/9G5NLnztIp): **February 10, 2026**

Me (26M) and my girlfriend (25F) have been together for 10 months. She already has a phone that works fine. I helped pay for it. Recently she told me she wants a second phone just for ""personal use"" and thinks I should buy it for her as an her upcoming birthday gift.

I asked what she means by personal use and she got vague. She said it's just not something she wants on her main phone. She also said it’s about ""privacy"" and that I should trust her. I told her I wasn’t comfortable paying for another phone without a clear reason. She got upset and said I was being controlling and turning money into a power thing. That wasn’t my intention. I just don’t want to feel like I’m being used or ignoring my gut.

I don't know what I should do now. Please give me suggestions.

Edited to add: As far as I know, she hasn't used any drugs or shown any interest in buying or selling them.

**Editor's note: OOP also made the same original post onto another subreddit, I am adding relevant comments from that sub for more context**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Who else accesses her phone besides herself and you? She wants a second phone to hide something from you. Take that information and use it as you will.

> **OOP:** Nobody else accesses her phone. I have all her passwords but never once went through her phone. Same with her as well. I'm starting to feel doubt.

**Commenter 2:** Two phones = Relationship Kaput

> **OOP:** I think I entered I am dating the wrong person. I was so desperate to not be single. I'm sorry. Ugh. This is so sad, I ignored the red flags.

**Commenter 3:** That's really strange. And wtf can't she buy herself a phone?!

> **OOP:** She wants me to provide, which I'm fine with, but the way she asked me was too suspicious and I don't think she's honest with me.

**Commenter 4:** It’s about cheating. Next.

> **OOP:** It hurts to realize that someone who loves you is acting this way.. I guess I'm hopeful for nothing.

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhatShouldIDo/s/CNkfQ05DbK): **February 11, 2026 (next day)**

Hey guys, today’s been a long day. I barely slept last night thinking of how stupid I was ignoring the red flags and trusting her words this whole time. I kept replaying everything in my head and reading through your comments. The more I thought about it, the more I realized if I didn’t end it now, I’d just talk myself into staying and slowly let this whole dynamic get worse. I could already feel myself starting to rationalize it. I didn’t like that.

So I got up early, made a couple strong cups of coffee, and called her since we don’t live together. I asked if she wanted to meet at a local park after I got off work. It’s a busy park, lots of people around. She agreed right away. It wasn’t unusual for us to meet there, especially since it’s been weirdly warm for February. I worked from home today and it was a blur. I did the bare minimum. Couldn’t focus. As soon as I was done, I called her to confirm and within about 30 minutes we were there.

At first I kept it light. We walked a bit, I joked around, got her laughing and eventually we sat down on a bench and told her we needed to talk. I explained how the whole second phone thing made me feel manipulated. I told her I already felt pressured helping pay for the first phone, and now being expected to buy another one for personal use with no clear explanation didn’t sit right with me.

She was quiet for a minute. Then she said it was a big ""misunderstanding"" and that she was joking about the second phone. That didn’t make sense to me. So I asked her why she doubled down about ""privacy,"" ""trust,"" and accused me of using money as power if it was just a joke. She couldn’t really answer that. It was just more vague stuff. That was kind of it for me. I told her I’d had enough and that I wanted to break up. She tried to kiss me after I said it, like that would smooth it over. I stepped back. I wasn’t going to let it turn into some emotional back and forth. I said I was done and started walking to my car. She walked off toward hers. I got in mine and left.

It sucked. I’m not gonna pretend it didn’t. But honestly, as soon as I drove away, I felt this weird mix of sadness and relief. I don’t want to be in a relationship where my gut is constantly telling me something’s off and I’m being told I’m controlling for asking basic questions. Anyway. That’s the update. Appreciate the straight talk from you guys. Sometimes you need outside perspective to see what you’re ignoring. 😊.

Also, I just wanted to clarify that we only had each other's phone and social media passwords because she strongly wanted it and offered me hers to convince me. I don't even know if the passwords were real because I had never once snooped on her. I changed my passwords this morning before work, so I'm not worried about that.

**Editor's note: OOP also made the same update post onto another subreddit, I am adding relevant comments from that sub for more context**

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** It sounds like you handled this extremely well. I know I would have struggled especially if I loved the person, so I really admire that you just went and did it after getting outside perspective. Open communication is the best kind of trust imo, and she wasn't doing that at all. You'll continue to feel happier after this adjustment period for sure

> **OOP:** I will definitely continue to ground myself and stay positive for the future. What is something that helped you feel happier?

**Commenter 2:** Well it's different for everyone depending on what kind of happiness you're looking for. Hobbies, self-care, it could be any number of things so it's a bit hard to give an answer when it's such an open-ended question 😅.

> **OOP:** I definitely should have been more specific LOL. For me, I like to cook, play chess, watch comedy movies, and hangout with my friends. It really makes me thankful and grateful there are many people in my life that love me and support me. Just curious, wat are your hobbies. I'm always looking to add and experiment new things. 😊.

**Commenter 3:** You did the right thing. Sometimes doing right is harder, more painful and sometimes depressing. But you have already felt the weight coming off your shoulders. Soon it will come off your mind as well. Welcome to adulthood. There is a lesson learned here b

**Commenter 4:** She probably has other social media stuff accounts you don't know about. She only gave you access to the ones you do know about. You made the right move.

1r8q5bv,https://www.reddit.com/r/botwatch/comments/1r8q5bv/reddit_bot_taxonomy_february_2026/,Reddit bot taxonomy - February 2026,"I track and report bot comments in r/CuratedTumblr, and lately I've been noticing bot accounts taking a few distinct forms, implying that the parties responsible are reusing or passing around the same LLM prompts or scripts.

I thought it might be helpful to name and document these types of accounts here in case it helps with anyone else's efforts.

# Comment formats

**Fellow Kids bot**

Example comments:

>imo lol honestly, space-farms osund way cooler than a dreadnought anyway no cap  
([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/MassEffectMemes/comments/1r441n9/comment/o59aeg3/?context=3))

>lowkey same here, i think it's the white noise and coyz vibes. but yeah, weird how it doesn’t hit everyone like that  
([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1r2wps7/comment/o503je5/?context=3))

These bots seem to be instructed to leave casual, slang-heavy replies. Since most LLMs have training data at least a couple years old, they seem to think the height of relevance is starting every post with ""highkey lowkey vibes ngl"".

The writing tends to be all-lowercase. They also insert typos, presumably to appear more realistic, although they tend to be typos that I've never seen a human make (see ""coyz"" above).

**Fun and Friendly Reply bot**

>Ancient Egypt really invented the *“delete search history panic”* long before Wi-Fi.  
([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/HistoryMemes/comments/1p7z7t9/comment/nr1auz6/))

>Peak 90s fever dream energy right there, absolutely iconic  
([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Millennials/comments/1p4f3bo/comment/nqdhfjz/))

This one is named after its prompt, which it's occasionally [accidentally leaked](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/comments/1p5a9bq/comment/nqk1fvz) by saying ""Sure, here's a fun and friendly reply you can use for that:"" (sometimes ""friendly and humorous reply""). It has certain tics it returns to over and over, like:

* ""doing X, one Y at a time""
* ""X really said Y""
* overusing words like ""peak"", ""chaotic"", ""vibes"" (sometimes all at once)
* referring to things as a ""fever dream""

In general it talks like a greeting card for millennials you would find circa 2018.

**Agree and Summarize bot**

>Dark, but yeah: the punchline is accountability never shows up.  
([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/1qttj8e/comment/o35g94k))

>For real, the morning news feels like walking into the Krusty Krab and getting assigned a new crisis before coffee. Let me pay my rent in sleep, please.  
([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/BikiniBottomTwitter/comments/1r1wuzx/comment/o4tove5/))

These are the hardest to spot from their writing style alone, since they tend to write very similarly to real people, though focusing more on the ""agree and summarize"" or ""mild quip"" comment format.

**Comment Repost bot**

([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1r1lfgc/comment/o4qiz7i/?context=3), [original](https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/1er8m5e/comment/lhx6yf0/))

Even more insidious are bots that repost top comments from the previous time the thread was posted, sometimes even recreating entire conversations. This requires two or more accounts to be working in tandem.

**Thumbs Up bot**

These are just bots that leave a 👍 emoji on dozens of threads. I see these less often and I'm not sure what they're trying to achieve.

# Username formats

These are a few username formats I've seen recur for bots. These are unlikely to stay relevant for long, since it would be easier for bot operators to just use the default Something-Something-1234 format.

**Word1word2**

Examples: Tangleharvest, Ponderglades

**First name + leetspeak food name**

Examples: josephinew4ffle8267, sherib3rry2438

These tend to be used for OnlyFans account promotion.

**Elvish(?) name**

Examples: AelricSathorin, AriethraVelanis

I've only seen a few of these, but they all joined on the same day.

**2004 AIM screen name**

Examples: AngeliiPrettyxo2, LuvviiAngelxo3

**Random word combos**

Examples: LowTallowLight, ZephyrHandbook

# General behaviors

Regardless of what writing style a bot is using, there are certain behaviors that they tend to stick to:

* Just agreeing with and summarizing the parent comment, sometimes with reference to the OP
* The usual ChatGPTisms (""that's not X, that's Y"")
* Run-on sentences that feel like they were written with an em dash. I assume this is what's happening, and then the script is taking out the em dash.
* Weird fixations on ""patch notes"" and ""Wi-Fi"" when trying to make jokes
* More likely to use ""smart"" (curly) quotes/apostrophes than straight quotes/apostrophes
* Comment is in unattributed quotes for some reason
* Focusing on the same few subreddits - WhatIsMyCQS, CuratedTumblr, ProgressivesHQ, freefolk, PrequelMemes, and ArcRaiders (lol) are all common bot hangouts for some reason.
* Inability to tell which parts of a meme are metaphorical
* Frequent reference to being on the internet, or reminding everyone what sub they're on
* Responding to comments as though the bot account is the OP (comment: ""Nice dress!"" bot: ""Thanks!"")

I'm at the point in my life where I'm ready to date mature ladies as I'm in my mid thirties. I have attracted older women before but didn't feel ready as I was still in the fast lane of partying and late nights. Now I've comfortably slowed down and have expanded my dating range. 

I like to give little gifts and I am looking for tips for women that are 45+ and what little things you would appreciate. I'm a practical gift giver and live in Canada so the first thing that came to mind was a nice purse sized hand cream but I'm stuck after that. Google told me luxury olive oil, high quality nuts and cashmere socks. Normally for the girls in the thirties I'd get them a coffee mug, makeup accessories, a cute hair clip, some candy/cookies from Italian shops etc. I know that I need to gage the interests of the person I am seeing but I want it to be a surprise and I'd like to know what's something you'd like in your purse, bathroom, kitchen, or just a little something you wouldn't get for yourself because you don't need it but it would be nice to receive. 

I should mention that the women I do attract are very successful in their careers either at the Director or CEO level and not sure what would be comforting for those high stress positions.

1r8q27z,https://www.reddit.com/r/portlandme/comments/1r8q27z/missed_connection_in_westbrook_cvs_pharmacy_line/,Missed Connection in Westbrook CVS Pharmacy Line,"CVS in Westbrook (870 Main St) pharmacy line today Feb18,2026 2pm right as the gates opened up after the pharmacists lunch break. I was sitting in a chair on my phone waiting aside where the line forms. People already started lining up as the gate was rolling up. She saw that I was waiting and offered me a place in line ahead of her. I thanked her softly. She had a severe nasal congestion that changed her voice as we exchanged pleasantries. I learned that she was there to get decongestant that they keep behind the counter and I remark on how unfortunate that that is the case. I let her go in front of me since her purchase would be faster than my questions about my prescription.

While waiting in line, we notice a woman before us leave the counter upset that her prescription would take 20 minutes. We joked about how this was such a minor issue because the weather is beautiful outside and 20 minutes is not a long time. I'm beginning to open my eyes for the first time and realize how happy this person is; even in her current state. She was looking directly at me and was not afraid to hold eye contact. She was wearing either a purple coat with a bright orange hat or an orange coat with a bright purple hat. We keep casually chatting and at this point, I'm starting to feel like she may be flirting with me.

Anyways, she gets to the front of the line and that is when I notice a triangle tattoo on her right ankle. I learned later that it was a dementors triangle from Harry Potter but I did not know what that was (I know, red flag) and instead I thought it was the recovery triangle from AA which I am a member of. I asked her the code phrase used to identify other members of AA which is, ""are you a friend of Bill W.?"" and she responded confused. I explained how I thought it was an AA tattoo. Her time in line was up.

We were both at different ends of the counter conducting our own business. She finishes first (like I thought she would) and leaves the pharmacy walking in my direction. As she's passing me, she quickly explains to me the real meaning of her tattoo with a little happy/smirky headshake. S\*\*\*, I am finding myself attracted to this cute, nerdy woman. This is when I should have done something but did not. I should have called her cute and ask if she had time to get coffee or exchange numbers, but nothing came out. I felt awkward doing so in front of the people in line and the pharmacy staff alike. Paralyzed in my own decision-making, I watched her walk away. I am my own failed wingman.

Going back to before I even entered the store, I pulled into the lot and noticed that I parked next to dog in the front seat. This dog was smiling with their tongue out and clearly very happy to be going on a car ride in this beautiful weather. That dog made me reconsider the ""rush"" I was in and reminded me that days like this were made to be savored. This part is important. When I leave, I notice that the car I parked next to with the happy dog is now gone. I immediately make the connection that this was her dog. Obviously this was true right? My thoughts said it had to be. A happy woman with her happy dog together only makes sense.

This is where I lose hope and get a reality check. Was she really that amazing or was I building this person up in my own head? Without getting coffee or talking with her more I wouldn't know. This was my missed connection. If you are out there reading this, I regret not saying more. I wrote this now in hopes of finding you in the void of Reddit with the realistic understanding that the probability of this working is like throwing darts  at an apple from 100 feet away.

Cheers to all who read this and maybe you can relate to my day with a similar feeling of missed connection.",8,1771476715.0,portlandme,12,0.78,False
