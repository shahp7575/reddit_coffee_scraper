Turns out I guess that's also how you make rock candy, which checks out haha. The bad thing is I think it crystallized in my pump mechanism too so that pump doesn't work now.

1fy8enl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fy8enl/i_accidentally_got_in_the_middle_of_my_friends/,I accidentally got in the middle of my friends‚Äô relationship and now things are weird,"I have a friend I've known for five years. We met when he was a barista at my favorite coffee shop, and we became friends through climate activism. About 2.5 years ago, we started hanging out more because he needed support in ending a toxic relationship. We went hiking, went to shows, and just spent a lot of time together. After he ended that relationship, he quickly met a new girlfriend who he wanted everyone to love and we all hung out a lot. He then went on a six-month bicycle tour around the U.S., and when he returned, we resumed spending time together.

I have a medical background and use psychedelics therapeutically, which I'm open about. One day, my friend‚Äôs girlfriend called me about some sexual dysfunction she was experiencing and asked if I knew of any psychedelics that could help. After some basic questions, I concluded her issues were likely related to underlying trauma and dissociation. I recently completed a 100-hour Internal Family Systems Therapy training, so I suggested we do some unburdening work. She agreed and seemed excited.

We met at cafes, and initially, her partner would stop by to check in on us. It seemed odd to me so I asked her if our meetings were awkward for them, and she said no. We met a few times for preliminary work, but then she got busy, and we didn‚Äôt meet for many weeks. Most sessions involved her expressing sadness about how he held back love, leaving her craving connection.

One day, she called in crisis. Starting school and studying in coffee shops reminded her of her partner working alongside young, attractive baristas, which triggered feelings of betrayal since he had cheated on her early in their relationship. I offered to meet for coffee the next day to talk it through, and she agreed.

During our meeting, she expressed anger toward her partner and a desire to cheat on him with others to hurt him. We did some therapeutic work, allowing her to identify and care for her angry and sad parts. I suggested she communicate her feelings to her partner instead of seeking revenge, which she decided to do. Afterward, she told me that she felt calmer and more clear-headed.

I suspect she told her partner about our conversation and my encouragement for her to talk to him. This was a sensitive issue he had avoided, and I think it made him uncomfortable that he now had to confront it because of my suggestion. They discussed it and worked things out.

After this, he began feeling threatened by me. I once sent him a link to a house on the market, suggesting he consider buying it. He later told me he assumed I was implying he should move out, as if I intended to move in with his girlfriend.

Recently, we all hung out because I was going through some tough changes and needed support, just as I had supported them. However, the atmosphere felt strange. His girlfriend was aloof and distracted, not engaging with me as she usually did. He kept saying, ‚ÄúYou really love my girlfriend, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù to which I replied, ‚ÄúI love both of you.‚Äù It was unsettling and made me regret getting so involved in their lives.

Things have been awkward since, and I‚Äôm confused about what‚Äôs happening. I just want to know: AITAH? What do I do if anything to fix the dynamic that has emerged?

1fy8el2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1fy8el2/does_anyone_wonder_if_they_even_have_ic/,does anyone wonder if they even have ic?,"So, I've been actually told i have IC but that's because we ruled everything out but sometimes I wonder. i see people with all kind of symptoms. my main symptoms are urgency,frequency and pressure. Pain comes from pressure, like the pain you feel when you need to pee or if you were peeing and stopped suddenly (but then I cant initiate flow). What helps is sitting down and breathing, trying to relax as much as possible and also waiting a little bit for the pee to ""accumulate"". dietary changes seem to help at different rates and not always, as in I haven't developed a certain causation rule x food causes x symptom. What I mostly notice is that increased drinks leads to increased urgency leads to increased peeing and then the cycle of not emptying out properly starts. And of course drinks such as beer and coffee cause it the most but I feel the symptoms nevertheless, just with less pressure. My flareups are also just a little bit worse than my average everyday experience but I don't alternate as much, it is the same everyday.

I know that this is IC but in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking whatever therapy I'm doing wont work and give up. Idk why. I really cant pin point anything that worked for sure, except stress management. I see some people also have a burning sensation and immense pain which I don't have (I also never experienced an uti, at least not one that was diagnosed) I sometimes wonder if I just have a weakened pelvic floor.

And so I did...

And y'all I wasn't expecting na... wala masyadong side effects?

After many years of asking them to consider going to therapy to deal with their issues with anxiety, depression, and a violent relationship with my brother; I decided to go no-contact. There also was a trip my brother and mother took last year to see me that cemented my decision to have them out of my life. I realized their cruelty and blatant disrespect would never end regardless of what I would say.

On to the present day: it's been a year. I have gone low-contact with my brother (from no-contact) frankly because I missed him and he was going through some big life events. But I still have some strong barriers up (no talk of politics whatsoever and talk of family is kept to a minimum where I verbalize when I'm uncomfortable).

As for my mother? I have spoken to her 3 times this year (once was a holiday, second was my brother's graduation, and third was due to a childhood medical question I needed answered. The third time happened very recently and it turned into a long drawn out 3 hour conversation. During that conversation I learned that my father had felt suicidal at one point during this estrangement (she didn't use those words but that's what I gathered from her description of a conversation they had had), my father believes he has Borderline Personality Disorder (this wasn't a surprise to me because he had texted me that a few weeks earlier), that he's experiencing night terrors every night, and that he wants to start going to therapy. My mother admitted to me that she still didn't understand the fight we had last year and that she knew she could've left when I asked her to but decided to stay for the rest of the week to ""screw me over"" (my husband described me as semi-comatose for the rest of that week). My mother also admitted that she blocked me on social media because of something I posted that said ""what it feels like when you're not struggling so much anymore"" because she thought it had something to do with her...

During this entire video call, she cried and was pretty emotional. My dad popped in at one point and I immediately panicked and turned the screen off. I could barely say anything other than ""this is too much, I need to go"" but he left pretty quickly while saying ""I love you so much"" and then I didn't see him anymore afterward (honestly, I haven't been able to have a face-to-face conversation with my dad in 2 years). The rest of the call was fairly uneventful and it was nice talking about more lighthearted things and vacations planned. And I mistakenly told her I'd talk to her again soon.

Now a week later, I feel immense regret having said that. I don't want to be close and the comment she made about last year's visit and the ""screwing me over"" still feels incredibly icky. Like, she hasn't changed. I wound up going to therapy to discuss this (I've been attending regularly for 1.5 years) and my therapists suggestion was primarily to do what feels right and perhaps decide to call them every major holiday for 30min or less to assuage the guilt I feel over the effect estrangement has had on them.

Frankly? I don't know what to do and all of that was compounded by an early birthday gift I received yesterday that wound up being from my father (a coffee cup with a sweet message inscribed). FYI, I never received a happy birthday message from my dad last year because he had decided to stop speaking to me a year before that due to a disagreement about a gifted apartment and a difference in politics). Now, I just feel incredible guilt all the time. I can't stop thinking about the things my mom told me over how my father is suffering and I can't look at the coffee cup he gifted me; I immediately get emotional. I know I have a major problem with guilt regarding my father (and we've touched on this a little during therapy) but all I've heard is that his consequences are not my fault (but it doesn't help how I feel).

I know I'll be hearing from my parents for my birthday soon but I don't know how I feel about it. I can't say if I'm dreading or looking forward to it. I just feel....too much.

","Hey y'all,

I wanted to share my personal experience with¬†[SynoGut](https://tinyurl.com/va6b458t), a supplement I've been using for a while now. I've done some deep diving into its ingredients and wanted to give you all a comprehensive review based on my experience. Here's a breakdown of each ingredient and how it‚Äôs worked for me:

**Psyllium**

This is a great source of soluble fiber. Since incorporating SynoGut into my routine, I‚Äôve noticed a significant improvement in my digestion and regularity. Psyllium helps bulk up stools and makes them easier to pass.

# [Get INSTANT Access to Synogut!](https://tinyurl.com/va6b458t)

**Bentonite Clay**

Known for its detoxifying properties, Bentonite Clay helps cleanse the gut. I‚Äôve felt less bloated and generally cleaner inside since I started taking SynoGut. It feels like a gentle detox every day.

**Black Walnut**

This ingredient is famous for its anti-parasitic properties. While I can't specifically point to its effects, the overall improvement in my gut health makes me believe it‚Äôs doing its job in keeping unwanted guests at bay.

**Oat**

Oats are rich in antioxidants and have anti-inflammatory properties. I've noticed that my stomach feels calmer and I have fewer digestive flare-ups, which I attribute to the soothing effect of oats.

# [Get INSTANT Access to Synogut!](https://tinyurl.com/va6b458t)

Overall, my experience with SynoGut has been overwhelmingly positive. The blend of these natural ingredients seems to work synergistically to improve digestive health. I feel lighter, more regular, and my gut health has definitely improved since I started using it. If you‚Äôre looking for a natural way to support your digestion, I highly recommend giving SynoGut a try.",1,1728309167.0,DogsWithCatHeads,0,1.0,False
1fy84el,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fy84el/24m_me_and_my_21f_girlfriend_confused_about_our/,24M me and my 21F girlfriend confused about our relationship,"I'll just shorten the scenario so that you guys get the hunch of it easily.   And I really need some honest proper opinion.

My gf who is loyal to me (no doubt) has broke my heart recently. So from her perspective, she doesn't like being flirted or hit on randomly from random people. In her say, it disgusts her. Tho recently she aggred that girls do try to make their man jealous by these stories. Super lovely, takes care of me, lives with me in same house. 

As per say, she also promised to me many times that she doesn't even get drunk without me, she wont ever dare to go to clubs without me. It gave me some expectations. As in my hopes were up.

But recently a week ago this happened. As she doesn't have any that kinda friend to hangout with, she found a girl (who's really irresponsible looking to me) that is kinda like her classmate, not that much friend friend. 

My gf ACTED like this another girl kept pushing her to go and have fun girls outing with her. Even made me believe that going to club or pub places (without their partner) was that girl's idea. They could have gone to so many other places to have fun girls outing. But though my gf said to me that she herself didn't plan all these. She even kept acting of asking me several times if she should go as the other girl is pressuring her to go with her. (P.S. my girl is new to alcohol and she kinda loves the drunk and dancing vibes in club but hates the looks and gazes of weirdos there) 
AS IF I SAID NO, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE GONE.
Also i dont wanna be your reason to be not being able to make friendsüò≠. 

After I went to pick her up, she was totally drunk. She was arguably explaining to me on our way home, why this girls night out was the BEST NIGHT ever. Also she mentioned all the things about people approaching them, hitting on them, giving looks etc to make me jealous. 

What she didn't know is that i was discreetly in the club just looking over her from far. (I know people can call me names after reading this but i do acknowledge i have huge insecurities)
Also i knew the fact that when she drunk, she can't really keep all her memories. Yes all the talking and everything she is fine with it even drunk, but she doesn't realize or just forgets of when someone pushed her or harrrasers gr1nding behind her. I came to know about this when I went to club with her first time. 

To my eyes, even that night i saw my girl being harrrrrased in many ways by some mofo dudes. I cant even explain word by word but these are some of their ways where the act is so small, that those harrassments in clubs go unnoticed all the time. I really hope some girl here can actually help me explain this thing that happens to them at club more, cuz thats the best I can explain. I do hope they get me point. But to me as an insecure person, i really kept crying my eyes out from far. I really tried to hide my tears from her even after she came home. I acted all nice. Because i really cant comprehend of what just happened.

She knows what happens at club, she knows that her boyfriend gets insecure about her leaving alone. . I just kept telling myself- (she gave me false hopes, she told me that she only enjoys in club with me then how was this her best night, why did she have to give me false hopes. I know clubbing and going girl outing is normal but no need to give false hopes like those. 

From the next morning, when i couldn't hold myself anymore, i burst to tears. Infront of her.
Since then from now, her main problem was that I didn't give her enough care and attention to her, she felt lonely, she wanted to drink. But as usual, her only words are ""trust me, i was sober and i let no one flirt or even touch me."" 
Now on earth how can i make her realize that i saw all that but you were so drunk that you didn't realize. 


The fact is that she does truely love me and I also thrive to give her the best of what i have. Im not that rich but still we manage our finances. Sometimes it goes tight budget. Both of us. She also tries to give her best to me and she also acknowledge that i do a lot for her.


Then why did a simple matter of not taking her to dates led her to make me jealous by going to club without me that she knew i would hate.
She even now argues about the fact that I let her go there inspite of her asking ne so many times. She says if i said no, she wouldn't have gone there. As if it was that simple to me.  


At the end, now she plays the victimand explains as I was the one who led her to take this step. On one hand, she plays safe and agrees that ""im sorry, i know i did wrong""
On the other, she keeps explaining to me how her act is justified as her only explanation is me not taking her to dates, -------(and a short note, she also said that i leave her to meet my friends whereas we do spend time together at same home. I just go with my boys out the house for some smokes or coffee for max 2 hours daily. Somedays we have studies so usually like 3/4 times a week i go have smoke with my boys. )------
I do keep trying my best and she acknowledged that im trying my best to provide for her and me. In future, us. We totally locked in as she always keeps expressing that how she even hates to sit close to another man. Always wanna be with me. 
Even after all my efforts, I had to experience these traumatic scenes of my girl being grinded frok behind by weirdos on dance floor and what not did I have to see. I really can't forget those things from my head and also those high hopes she gave me before. 


I really love her and i cant just leave her for this. But the thought that she knowingly went to an unsafe place without me and now she doesn't even realize how she hurted me. I cant even explain to her that i saw stuffs happening around her when she was on dance floor. I really cant blame her for freaks doing fresky stuffs and even i know she just wanted to have some fun. But her pure innocent fun has made a big scratch in my heart and gave me a good level of trauma that haunts me everyday. 
I cant just seem to overlook this incident.

How should i now proceed with what i want and what i have?
I need some pure honest feedbacks. Please do blame or correct me if im doing anything wrong in my relationship. Im open to any afvice at this point.  

How do i settle down my heart? 

How can i explain my pain to her so she understands the level of hurt she has done? 


I know i said short, but still sorry for the long paragraph.

1fy838z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fy838z,"A review of ""B.P.R.D. The Universal Machine"" by an avid reader of Hellboy's Universe","One of the more exceptional things about the world of the B.P.R.D is the fact that among all of the terrifying, world-ending monsters and the chaos of the supernatural, the one thing that gets my attention the most is the complex characters written by Mignola and Arcudi. No matter what city gets destroyed or what evil a cosmic horror releases, I constantly find myself enthralled with the lives of Abe, Liz, Kate, Johann and Daimio. The task force feels like their more than comic book characters, and it‚Äôs easy to get attached to their lives and the stakes their personal woes put upon them.

Today‚Äôs story, ‚Äú*The Universal Machine*‚Äù (Written by Mike Mignola & John Arcudi with Art by Guy Davis and Colors by Dave Stewart) caps off the first part of the B.P.R.D‚Äôs war with the Frog creatures and deals with the aftermath of ‚Äú*The Black Flame*‚Äù, but doesn‚Äôt have to do with beasts of annihilation. Instead, this story is split into two and sees Kate Corrigan and new B.P.R.D agent Andrew Devon head to a small village in France to hunt down a book to potentially revive Roger while the rest of the team share a cup of coffee and talk about the role that death has had in their lives. 

This story gets really personal while still giving a compelling and anxiety-inducing plot that gives us such an insight into Kate, Daimio, and Johann like we haven‚Äôt seen before, while adding more to Abe and Liz‚Äôs complicated and tragic lives. This is my favorite B.P.R.D story to date with ‚Äú*The Black Flame*‚Äù following closely. So, ladies and gentlemen and anyone else who wants to be here, without further ado‚Ä¶‚Ä¶



:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

***B.P.R.D. THE UNIVERSAL MACHINE***

*Lincoln, Nebraska*

Abe Sapien and Captain Ben Daimio oversee the deployment of thousands of bombs being deployed by fighter jets into the large hole left in the city by the monstrous Katha-Hem. Abe asks Daimio if he thinks the explosives will actually do anything to prevent the return of the monster, and Daimio remarks that even if it doesn‚Äôt, it will make the world feel better now if it‚Äôs done. Daimio tells Abe the destruction left by the monster will be used to fill the hole, and that out of all the people that died in the attack, the only person he can think of is Roger.

Back in Colorado, Liz, Kate, and Johann grieve Roger in their own ways. Kate meets with B.P.R.D operative Andrew Devon, who claims that a special version of the ‚Äú***Flamma Reconditus***) (The Secret Flame) has been found in the small french village of Ableben.Kate tells Devon the Bureau has a copy, but the young agent explains that this is Hollandus (16th Century Alchemist) edition, and could be the key to reviving Roger. Even though she‚Äôs skeptical, the historian agrees to go with the young man to track down the book. 

This is where our story splits into two.Since Kate and Devon were the catalyst for the divide in the story, we‚Äôll head to France and start with them.

‚Äî--------------------------------------------------------

*Kate and Andrew‚Äôs French Adventure*

Twenty seven hours later the young agent and the historian arrive in the small village of Ableben. Kate explains to Devon she needed to come along because as a historian, she would be able to use her knowledge of the town‚Äôs history to make a connection with the antique dealer they were going to meet and will be able to secure the book. Kate explains that the town used to rest under a large castle owned by the Marquis Adote de Farbre, an eccentric collector from hundreds of years ago that owned a large menagerie of rare animals, never seen by the French villagers before. The villagers convinced themselves that one of the animals was a werewolf that was abducting and killing children, so they banded together with torches and pitchforks and began an assault on the castle.

During the attack, a large burst of lightning came down and destroyed the Marquis‚Äô home, blasting the wreckage all over the town below. A hundred years later Pope Sixtus expunged the curse from the land, and the villagers used pieces of the destroyed castle to build their homes and other structures. The historian is confident her vast knowledge of folklore and history will secure them *The Secret Flame* and the two head to an antique shop in town. They‚Äôre met by a peculiar Frenchman by the name of Thierry. Devon points out an odd ring the store owner is wearing, and the man explains that it‚Äôs a replica of the ring used by Pope Urban the Seventh to lift the Marquis‚Äô curse from Ableben. Kate points out it was Pope Sixtus who did that, and Thierry is impressed. Devon tries using his cell phone to contact Director Manning they had made it to France, but Thierry explains the village gets no cell service and sends the young man outside to use the only phone booth in town.

Thierry and Kate walk through the store, with the antique collector trying to stump the doctor with difficult questions. Kate answers all the questions with ease, but Thierry believes he has her stumped as they arrive in front of a taxidermied Mandrill. Thierry smugly asks Kate what they are looking at, and after a moment and with a smirk, Kate replies it‚Äôs a werewolf. Thierry laughs and concedes to Kate, expressing how silly and superstitious the villagers were for believing the monkey was a vile monster, but Kate responds she doesn‚Äôt believe they were superstitious at all. The people of the time were using the knowledge they had to make sense of the terrifying unknown beast they had seen. The Frenchman agrees and they go further and further into the ‚Äúsmall‚Äù store.

Kate eventually mentions that this place is much deeper than it appears on the outside, and Thierry comments that he wishes the world could be a place to store his vast collection, but he refuses to share. A look of panic comes onto Kate‚Äôs face when she sees a large skeleton hanging from the ceiling and bookshelves lining the endless walls.Devon notices while he is on the phone that the blind on the front window of the shop is closed and he quickly leaves the booth and kicks down the door. Once inside, he sees that the once filled room is empty and all that is left is a painting of a castle.

Kate is brought to a large dining hall where several ancient vampires are poking at a small bird with forks. A small creature named Lagerk is summoned by the shop owner to bring them wines, but Kate declines. Thierry laughs and kicks Lagerk, mocking him for being so disgusting. Kate quickly comes to the realization that even though the man and place were destroyed over 500 years ago, she was in the court of the Marquis Fabre with the quirky collector himself. The Marquis explains to the doctor that his copy of *The Secret Flame* has copious amounts of notes in it from the books author, Ini-Herit. He tells her Herit once created dozens of homunculi, many of which the collector had in a display case. He shows her a mortar and pestle that belonged to another alchemist, Edel Mischrasse, and when Kate shows she doesn‚Äôt recognize the name, The Marquis laughs in victory. He explains to her the man took Ini-Herit‚Äôs notes and expanded upon them, creating two perfect homunculi, and the Bureau was in possession of the corpse of the one he wanted for his collection. He reveals he had no intention to give the historian the book, and instead wants to trade her life for Roger‚Äôs body. Outside, Devon is cornered in the phone booth by the villagers who have transformed into wolves. One of the beasts instructs the agent to call Manning and give him the terms for Kate‚Äôs release.

Kate is in disbelief as the vampires hold her in a chair. The madman seems to have a change of heart at the last minute and gives Kate the book, saying she can leave with it and her life if he can have the ‚Äúfishman‚Äù (Abe) for his collection, and that Devon was already told this. 

Kate is at a loss. She yells at the creatures to let her go and convinces Fabre to let her go outside and switch with Andrew so she can make the negotiations with Manning. As they go to shake on it, Kate brandishes a knife she stole from one of the vampires, cutting off some fingers from the immortal‚Äôs hand. He smacks her and mocks her for her stupidity, but quickly realizes the doctor cut off his ring. Kate picks up the finger with the ring and tosses it to Lagerk, who transforms into >!a large dragon demon. The entity reveals himself to be a prince of Hell by the name of Marchosias and that he was enslaved for hundreds of years, along with his princess Iblifikia, who turns out to be the small bird being tortured by the vampires.!< The large crow demon eats her tormentos and the large dragon demon causes the castle to burn as he blasts Kate into a grandfather clock just before she can grab the book.

A few hours later a B.P.R.D clean up crew along with Devon scour the town for Kate, and finally find the clock with her in it.

‚Äî--------------------------------------------------------

*Daimio, Liz, Johann, and Abe get real*

Daimio, Liz, and Johann discuss in the Colorado HQ‚Äôs kitchen the implication of what Kate is going to France to do. Daimio believes that Roger is dead and that is final, but Johann points out as a homunculus that Roger was never alive, so how could they know he was dead. The conversation leads to the fact that Johann, Liz, and Abe have all died and have different experiences with the concept, but no one knows what happened to Daimio in the jungle before he passed away. The former marine finally agrees to tell the story, and Liz tries to call Abe to come join, who ignores the call to be a sad Victorian.

Daimio tells his teammates of a rescue mission gone wrong in Bolivia in 2001. The Captain and his men were ambushed by a local jaguar cult and then killed one by one by a large shadow creature. Abe comes in around this time, and the Marine continues that he ends up being the only one left. He‚Äôs haunted by images of his fallen troop, and is attacked by a jaguar-headed skeleton wearing a nun‚Äôs clothes. As he bleeds out on the jungle floor, one of the small creatures Daimio found in the HQ‚Äôs sub-basement in ‚Äú*The Dead8‚Äù calls for an extraction for Daimio and mocks him. A vision of a large jaguar God appears to the Captain, who tells him:

‚Äú***The old world is your soul. Leave it there. It is old. The new world is life. TAKE. YOUR. LIFE.***‚Äù

A few days later the marine cuts himself out of a body bag. Johann asks the Captain what he thought of his death dream, and mentions he‚Äôs had a few. Johann‚Äôs experience with death doesn‚Äôt take place just before he dies, but rather when he was working steadily as a medium. A soldier asks the man to connect him with his wife who passed away while he was on duty. Johann calls upon the woman, but falls in love with her. He coerces the two lovers to continue the sessions, with the woman spilling every secret she ever had, and Johann falls deeper and deeper. Eventually, the husband refuses to come back and Johann‚Äôs wife realizes what is going on. Krauss tries to contact the dead woman on his own, but she rejects him in anger, saying he‚Äôs an abomination for being a living man in love with the dead, and that he‚Äôs too sad to be mad at.

Daimio taunts Johann for being a weirdo and Liz tells the ectoplasmic man she understands where he is coming from and sympathizes. Daimio teases Liz until she tells her story about death. Liz tells them a story about one night of her being put to sleep by a babysitter and being woken up by her brother and dog. Her brother tells her that someone doesn‚Äôt want him to visit Liz, and the young girl tells him that this new home frightens her. She believes something else is there, and sees two ghastly figures behind her brother. She screams and runs down the stairs and when her brother asks what‚Äôs wrong, she points behind him and asks if he sees them. He turns his head, and reveals it‚Äôs their parents, and when he turns his head back, it‚Äôs replaced by an image of a melting skeleton. Her dog runs up to her, but is now also a gross skeleton. The young girl wakes up in the arms of a B.P.R.D agent wearing a protective suit, shushing Liz and telling her she‚Äôs here for the girl.


Johann tells Liz he believes it was her family trying to contact her to forgive her for what happened. Liz agrees, but Daimio insinuates it may have been Liz‚Äôs guilt for what she did to her family and all of the people in her neighborhood. Liz begins to say a swear word at the Captain, and Johann cuts her off to ask Abe about his experience with death. The amphibian thinks of his journey with Caul over the last few months, but refuses to talk about it. He does tell them about a mission Hellboy and him went on in the 80‚Äôs to Canada to hunt a Wendigo (a creature who captures the souls of (usually) murders and cannibals. After you‚Äôre killed, the soul inside the monster is released and yours is kept inside until you kill again.) After capturing the beast, they find out he was a man named Daryl Tynion who was killed by a Wendigo on a hunting trip. Hellboy has no explanation of why he was chosen because the man wasn‚Äôt a murderer, but says he just has bad luck. Daryl asks the demon to shoot him and end his life, but Hellboy explains how the curse of the Wendigo works as they pull into a Canadian B.P.R.D detention facility. The monster is put in a cell, but given a picture of his family by Hellboy, so he has something to hang onto as he loses his memory of his life as a man and the beast takes over. 

Everyone is disappointed that Abe refused to talk about his experience in Crab Point as Devon calls into the B.P.R.D. The four discuss with Manning the possibility of giving Roger or Abe up, but Johann screams that Roger is not dead. Eventually, Kate and Devon come back to HQ without the book. Kate, Abe, Liz and Manning talk about what‚Äôs next to save Roger, but Manning says there is nothing else to be done.

Johann takes his ectoplasmic form and goes into the hole in Roger‚Äôs chest. He‚Äôs transported to a world where his ecto form is of him in his containment suit, because that‚Äôs all Roger ever knew of him as. The homunculus tells the medium he is so happy he got to meet his friends, but doesn‚Äôt want to be saved. He‚Äôs happy in this little paradise he‚Äôs made for himself. He asks Johann to bury his remains as if he was a man, and the two men say goodbye for the last time.

>!The last page shows Roger as a small boy sitting in front of a statue of the goddess Cloacina with a red ball and his tombstone shown in a panel below. I‚Äôll [link that here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ISqbL5v) if anyone wants to see it.!<

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

This is the most special and important Hellboy Universe story to me to date. I felt so much reading about the experiences these wonderfully tragic characters had with death, but it was more about that. It was a conversation about regret, rebirth, love, heartbreak, and what it means to be a human at the end of your life. We see death so much in these stories, and we see so many lives being saved. But the very fact we get to see the perspective of these people who have been back and forth and they‚Äôve committed themselves to keeping as many souls around as possible is so fuc**ing good.

The ‚Äúmain‚Äù plot of Kate and Andrew‚Äôs adventure in France was quite enjoyable, and had quite a twist ending. There were some interesting parallels at the beginning of the story, with the city of Lincoln and the village of Ableben. Both used the destruction caused by supernatural forces to rebuild. And even though no actual ‚Äúaction‚Äù happened at the HQ, the theme of history mattering and needing to be shared and told was apparent throughout both plots.

There‚Äôs nothing here I can say about Arcudi and Davis I haven‚Äôt said before, but it was so sweet to see Mignola do the final sequence between Johann and Roger. It‚Äôs truly the end of an era. This story really does wrap up the first part of *The Plague of Frogs* cycle in the best of ways. It‚Äôs getting one Golden Army for each tear that fell onto the pages of my omnibus from the last page.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

And that‚Äôs it. I really wish ‚Äú*Plague of Frogs*‚Äù, ‚Äú*The Dead*‚Äù, ‚Äú*War On Frogs*‚Äù, ‚Äú*The Black Flame*‚Äù and ‚Äú*The Universal Machine*‚Äù were in their own omnibus, because it feels weird going into ‚Äú*Garden of Souls*‚Äù with this feeling of starting new again, but I get that would be too much for one book. I truly can‚Äôt express anymore how fantastic this story was, and I hope it was as special for others as it was for me.

The reviews have slowed down a lot due to my new work schedule, but I still plan on keeping up with these. As I‚Äôve said before, this experience has been fantastic. I decided to read ‚ÄúHellboy: Darkness Calls‚Äù on the suggestion of u/JulixgMC in between ‚Äú*Killing Ground*‚Äù and ‚Äú*The Warning*‚Äù, so I‚Äôm still chugging along quite well. Before I get into ‚Äú*The Wild Hunt,*‚Äù I plan to re-read ‚Äú*Seed of Destruction*‚Äù and doing an ‚Äúupdated‚Äù post about it to fit my more recent review style, and to give myself a refresher of where I came from.

I truly hope you all enjoyed this read-along, and let me know down below what you thought of ‚Äú*The Universal Machine*‚Äù and where it ranks among your favorite B.P.R.D. stories. As always there will be a comment down below with links to the posts for my other reviews if you want to read about a different story. Thank you all so much, and until next time, everyone.

I wonder if Kate will let me keep this‚Ä¶..Nick.

(Davis‚Äô scenes at the end with the demons is absolutely haunting and amazing. There isn‚Äôt anyone who does monsters better‚Ä¶.Fegredo and Mignola are close behind, but Davis is such a rockstar.)",2,1728308981.0,HellBoy,1,1.0,False

","If you‚Äôve been looking at different interior design styles, you‚Äôve probably come across two big ones: **Art Deco** and **Mid-Century Modern**. Both have left their mark on furniture and design, but they‚Äôre very different. Let‚Äôs take a look at what makes each of them unique and how they can change the feel of your home.

[Savoy Green Sectional Sofa ](https://preview.redd.it/88w2ro929ctd1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d97a7e6244b4b752fb6adc1ab0b4e89812d8ff3)

**Where They Came From**

**Art Deco** started in the 1920s and is all about luxury and glamour. It was inspired by the latest technology at the time, with bold geometric patterns, rich colors, and fancy materials like chrome, glass, and marble. Imagine vintage pieces that are elegant and detailed.

**Mid-Century Modern** came around in the 1950s and was inspired by simplicity and function. It‚Äôs all about clean lines, natural shapes, and materials like wood, leather, and metal. It feels warm but also sleek.

**Colors and Materials**

**Art Deco** loves dramatic colors like deep blues, emerald greens, and gold. You‚Äôll often see¬†

shiny surfaces and rich materials like velvet and lacquered wood. The furniture usually has detailed patterns and polished metals that make it look sophisticated.

**Mid-Century Modern**, on the other hand, goes for more natural, earthy tones. Think olive, mustard, and brown, often paired with natural wood finishes. The look is simple, with minimal decoration and clean surfaces.

**Furniture Shapes and Forms**

In **Art Deco**, the furniture is bold and often oversized. You‚Äôll find curved velvet sofas or shiny coffee tables with big geometric designs. Each piece is meant to stand out.

In **Mid-Century Modern**, the furniture is more understated and practical. The shapes are organic, with simple lines and tapered legs. It‚Äôs made to be comfortable and functional, fitting into everyday life easily.

**Function vs. Aesthetics**

Art Deco style works more on looks than function. It‚Äôs about creating a visually striking space. It‚Äôs more about style than practicality. That's why it's designed for every detail is designed to impress.

In contrast, Mid-Century Modern is designed to be functional while still looking good. The furniture is made for daily use. Also, it offers comfort without losing style. Whether it‚Äôs a dining chair or a dresser, each piece has a purpose. On the other hand, it keeps that timeless, modern look.

**Where to Find These Styles Today**

If you‚Äôre looking for **Art Deco** furniture, check out vintage shops or specialty stores where you can find original pieces from the 1920s and 1930s. There are also reproductions that capture the glamorous essence of the style.

For **Mid-Century Modern**, you‚Äôre in luck! This style has made a huge comeback, so you can find plenty of options in modern furniture stores. If you‚Äôre in Houston, **Midinmod Furniture** has a great selection of mid-century modern sofas, chairs, and more.

**Which Style is Right for You?**

Choosing between **Art Deco** and **Mid-Century Modern** depends on your personal style. If you love bold, luxurious spaces that feel like something from a classic movie, **Art Deco** might be your style. But if you prefer clean lines, functional designs, and natural colors, **Mid-Century Modern** gives a more relaxed yet stylish vibe.

**Ready to Redesign Your Space?**

Whether you like the showy side of Art Deco or the simplicity of Mid-Century Modern, your home should be to your taste. Play around with both styles and try to see how they can elevate your space.

I have an 8 year old Miele CM6310 with a count of around 12.5K. I have never had any problems with it until now. The issue is that no coffee comes from the spout and no rinse water comes from the spout when the machine is turned on. When making a coffee, the machine seems to go through the process: it grinds the beans, pre-brews but then the process is automatically cancelled when the coffee should flow and the machine shows the message ""Fill and replace the water container"".

Everything else works fine including hot water only, milk, froth etc. Also, the descaling and cleaning cycles work fine including water coming through the spout during these cycles. The grinder works and the machine produces a puck that looks OK but dry.

Based on advice from this community, I replaced and greased all of the brew unit o-rings and, subsequently, replaced the drainage valve. Unfortunately, neither of these fixed the problem. Due to the age of the machine I am reluctant to ask Miele to come out to repair it. Can anyone suggest what the problem might be?

1fy7yqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/reactivedogs/comments/1fy7yqt/new_reactive_rescue_dog_and_everyone_seems_to_be/,New reactive rescue dog and everyone seems to be an expert dog trainer all of a sudden rant.,"I just adopted my first dog. Mavis is approx 2 y/o and was adopted from a humane society where she was surrendered as a stray. In the HS she showed minimal reactivity and mostly only reactive to other reactive dogs. Chill dogs she was fine with. Well, 2 weeks later and I think the reactivity has gotten worse. I think this is a combination of my fault for being unprepared to raise a reactive dog and also we are only on week 3 after adoption. 

When I brought her home, I was unprepared for the barking at every stranger and new sound. My neighbor who used to work at Petsmart started giving me advice and telling me to correct the behavior immediately by yanking on the color/leash. In hindsight, I think this practice the first couple days really made things worse. Now she barks at every dog/person/car she sees. 

My neighbor is also super anti-kenneling. They were not so subtly shaming me yesterday for leaving my dog at home while I ran some errands for a couple hours (4 hrs max). She was barking and whining. I told them this is normal and expected behavior because she is a rescue and still within the 3-3-3 rule. (If it continues past the 3 months, I am going to contact a vet/behaviorist). She keeps telling me I should leave Mavis with her while I am at work/doing errands so that she doesn't have to be kenneled. I have tried to gently refuse, but she wasn't taking no for an answer. I have watched her hit my other neighbor's dog (who I have deemed the demon dog) in order to ""train"" him. 

Then, after I got home and had this ""altercation"" with the neighbor about how barking was considered normal behavior, I took Mavis out for a walk/to play fetch in a small one-dog-at-a-time dog park near my apartment. On the way out she saw a squirrel and went batsh\*t crazy. The demon dog happened to be in my neighbor's apartment where the balcony door was open with screen door closed. He also went batsh\*t crazy and I was trying to redirect Mavis. My neighbor had the audacity to open the screen door and let the demon dog out onto the porch. Both dogs were going crazy and I lost it on my neighbor. I yelled ""Seriously?! Put the dog inside! That didn't make anything better!"" This neighbor of mine has been pushing and pushing me to introduce Mavis to the demon dog so that there can be ""harmony"" in the building. I have repeatedly said I do not want to introduce them. The demon dog is reactive and Mavis is reactive and both have not had enough training to make it a positive experience. Plus, Mavis is like 50 lbs while demon dog is maybe 20 so if something happens, I could be looking at footing vet bills and having to file police report on Mavis because she is the bigger dog. This neighbor just will not respect it at all. 

On another note. I stupidly took Mavis to a cafe on the boardwalk by the river in town. We were sitting outside. I brought her lick mat and plenty of treats to try to socialize her around people. She is also people reactive. SHE DID PHENOMENAL! for like 30 minutes until some kids walked by and then she lost her sh\*t. Then some lady had to come barging towards us yelling at me that if ""I can't train my dog not to bark I shouldn't have her in public spaces"" and that ""this was human land, not dog land"". I can't fully disagree with her but of course that made the whole experience negative for Mavis. She was able to calm down and was meeting everyone fairly calmly and friendly for the next 30 minutes with the occassional mishap. Then she started to get bored so I took her home, made sure she went potty, kenneled her (oh the horror) and went back to finish hanging out with my friends at the coffee shop.

I am just so fed up with everyone giving me advice and commenting on how I am training my dog. I have had so much (mostly well-intentioned) advice over the last two weeks that I eventually just snapped and I couldn't handle it any more. I wasn't super kind to Mavis on our walk this morning. She was pulling so hard and I feel terrible about how I reacted to it. Anyway, I just needed to vent all of this to some people who hopefully understand so that when I get home from work, I can start back on the positive reinforcement training and put the bad advice from my neighbor behind me.",2,1728308652.0,reactivedogs,3,1.0,False

I built this using Cursor and my preferred tech stack in 5 days. In short, you choose a rail system, choose how you're going to get where you're going when you exit the train, and choose from a list of points of interest to map. I like the Coffee option, personally.

It supports BART, The ""L,"" DART, The ""T,"" MATA, MARTA, MTA (New York), TEXRail, and the TRE today.

1fy7qwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1fy7qwp/discussion_managing_diabetes_at_family_events/,Discussion: Managing Diabetes at Family Events,"Hi All,

Does anyone else struggle with trying to manage their blood sugar levels and family expectations during events?

We have 4 Type 2 diabetics in the family including myself. 3 are solidly 20-30 years older than me and have kids at or younger than me for reference. I found myself sitting outside at the ‚Äúkids‚Äù table (I‚Äôm in my late 20s) - because it got a bit too crowded inside the house. But the kids (9 to 17) looked at me and asked why I wasn‚Äôt feeling well (my sugar was at ~ 340) and why I needed to take insulin. I explained that my sugar was high and that the insulin would help to lower it - I just needed to walk around a bit and drink some water. The kids asked me why I needed to take insulin when none of the other T2D adults needed to take insulin (none are on pumps either - just med only T2Ds) and why I couldn‚Äôt have any desert, or bread/cheese, etc that their mom made. I tried to explain how food is composed of protein, carbs, and fat - and that carbs can affect your blood sugar when you‚Äôre diabetic. I was met with largely blank stares. 

Once the dizziness subsided and my sugar finally started to creep closer to 300 after 2 hours, I went back inside only to have the other T2Ds tell me that I‚Äôm clearly a ‚Äúbad‚Äù diabetic if I‚Äôm having high sugar levels when they‚Äôre eating the same thing and for worrying the kids. 

I ended up getting my husband and driving home. Woke up this morning (the day after said event) - with another 60 units of humalog in my system (20u every 4 hours if my sugar is still above 300) with a fasting sugar of 241. I just don‚Äôt get it. I really don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know how to explain this stuff to kids or to even other adults - diabetic or non diabetic. But it feels extremely isolating. I‚Äôm just glad the kids cared enough to ask. I grew up in a family of T2Ds just as insulin resistant as I am.. so to me, this is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. I was helping my mom with her insulin shots when I was 10.. so it‚Äôs very weird to me that the other adult T2Ds in my husbands family never explained it to the kiddos.

I‚Äôll probably end up increasing my long acting insulin this morning by another 5 units and take some fast acting and just go without eating again. I understand that there are different kinds of insulin (I‚Äôm on generic insulin glargine @ 22u & humalog @ 60-80u per day) but I don‚Äôt think my insurance will allow me to change insulins. I‚Äôm allergic to GLP-1s (anaphylactic response to Ozempic and Victoza) along with Metformin. I‚Äôm also on glipizide too. For anyone that isn‚Äôt familiar with Kaiser - my doctors work for the insurance company that pays for my meds. So, it‚Äôs like pulling teeth for diabetes care - I have a diabetic pharmacist and that‚Äôs it. My diabetes isn‚Äôt considered ‚Äúbad‚Äù enough to warrant talking to an endocrinologist. My PCP is decent, but he won‚Äôt go near diabetes care with a 20 ft pole unless I threaten to file a grievance. I also can‚Äôt go outside of Kaiser for treatment. 

For reference - I had 2 cups of iced coffee with 2 Splenda and a splash of milk with a pump of sugar free hazelnut syrup, a plain burger with ketchup, and a salad (just lettuce and a sprinkle of parm) since my husband‚Äôs family doesn‚Äôt serve any vegetables whatsoever and the salad was an attempt to pander toward my asking for veggies and less carbs. Probably refilled my water bottle 6-7 times in 2 hours at the rate I was drinking it. ",1,1728308059.0,diabetes,0,1.0,False

We have amazing chemistry in sex, and he‚Äôs said multiple times that he‚Äôs never had a better partner than me, which I agree with. That‚Äôs why we both stopped seeing other people on our own. If either of us wants to have sex with someone else, we invite them into our dynamic instead. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm emotionally attached to him, I‚Äôm just really enjoying our connection and want to spend more time together outside of sex. I don‚Äôt have many friends at the moment, so maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm feeling this way.

I got frustrated and told him that he doesn‚Äôt respect me or care about my feelings. I thought after seeing someone for a year, it wouldn‚Äôt be such a taboo to just hang out like friends. He says he has a busy and tiring job as a foreman at a defense company and that he has no emotional attachment to anyone.

Am I wrong to feel hurt or frustrated by this? I feel like after all this time, it wouldn‚Äôt be so hard to just spend time together without sex involved.",1,1728307885.0,gaybros,5,0.57,False

1fy7n4p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1fy7n4p/need_advicefeedback/,Need Advice/Feedback,"Hello Everyone, i am a 26 Yo male non-Filipino and not Western and i dated a 25 yo cute Filipina, at first we were friends, both of us are international students in college in Canada, i used to find her with my other Filipina friend when they switched us the previous semester.

we slowly became friends, and then we got closer and closer until a bond was forged before we entered the relationship we set standards and we talked about lots of future subjects, like values, religion, and finances, and we agreed on them, what got me attracted to her was her personality and her intelligence and physically she was tiny and adorable.

she used to tell me i date to marry, she used to be in a 6 years relationship that ended before she came to a new country and my last relationship was in 2018 , we agreed that this is not a rebound relationship or wasting our time, we are here for the future since we are both building our life and we have shared goal.

we spent 8 months together, and lots of very good memories, I know how happy and comfy i made her feel, and the same for her to me, yeah we have disagreements here and there like any other couple out there and we know we are not perfect and we acknowledged that this relationship we will be challenging because we are not from the same culture however as long as we are together we can find solutions.

She lives here with her aunt , and this aunt at first wasn't accepting of me , (the aunt never saw me or even talked me , she just judged me based on my religion and ethnicity) she used to tell her go marry a canadian citizen (all the info i have of her aunt is from my gf) however, my gf used to tell me that she spends lots of time and effort to paint me in a good image to her aunt.

and she used to tell me that her aunt gave her so much stress and hard time, especially taking care of her aunt's kids, that can be hard to manage as an international student in a foreign country.

days and months passed by , we had our highs and lows as any normal relationship but we always bounce back and our love never diminished.

even when i returned back home and we switched to LDR for 2 months our love stayed strong even though we had a small quarrels at that time but we always pushed through.

on September 24th 2024, on my other friend's birthday , we were in college going together to get those plastic forks and spoons , we passed by 2 other Filipinos that we don't like and they don't like us (especially me), one of them is a female that used to spread bad rumors about me to my gf aunt( all the info i have about these 2 people are from my gf, especially the girl she doesn't like my gf they are roommates in my gf's aunt house) and since my gf is scared of her aunt that made things complicated, so when i saw my gf waving hi at them, as a reflex i slightly pushed her on the back as a le'ts go hurry, I intended no harm whatsoever. she trumbled a bit and said to me ""why did you push me infront of them?"" i said don't worry about it let's go our friend is waiting.

we took pictures with our friend and when we are going home together she started talking about how that slight push because it was infront them , they will go report it to her aunt and all her efforts of building my image will go to vain and she started crying because she thought i don't understand and it escalated i try to de-escalate by telling her they won't report it , it was a slight push and she was more enraged , we reached home we argued for abit and then i left her to go cooldown a bit and then comeback (bear in mind that i was dealing with some other personal stuff from other sides aswell) when i came back after few minutes i found her packing her clothes and stuff and i told her , are you going to keep doing this whenever we had arguments ? then she booked an uber and i was so tired and drained, i wished her a happy life in the heat of the moments when we were fighting, then she left in the uber, then couple of hours later i sent her a text message on messenger apologizing and such , she said she forgives me and that she wants peace now and then she removed the chat colors and removed the nicknames, and i asked why she said because she is serious, i left here be for couple of hours then i texted her if there is any possibility for her to come back and talk ? she spoke in slogans and said No that boat has sailed..

and since that i tried to reconcile and talk to her more and no text worked she was talking about how she tried and how i deserve someone better and that i am not happy with her and such and that she can only offer friendship and dramatic talks that is not true, then i met her after the incident face to face to further try and reconcile with her and tell her we passed by bumps before this is a small bump in our future and we are here for the long run and she started crying again and her aunt again was brought up and this time magically her aunt became nice and caring..we spoke for 3 hours i was trying to reconcile and we didn't reach anywhere she says she forgives me but she can't forget, as if i did this unforgivable catastrophic sin.. before she left for work she said if you want to be friends let me know your decision..

after that, i tried again and again to reconcile and Monday morning she said , she will considerate but i needed to give her time , so i let her be and on that night of that monday she texted me on how we cannot make it and we are not compatible and she brought up stuff that we already discussed and agreed on since we met as if she doesn't know me for 8 months and lots of dramatic texts not logical at all. so and this is my bad i panicked and i started begging and pleading and calling her and i lost control of my emotions , she picked up and my crying voice i tried reconciling again telling her we have been through bad and sour and good together , as long as we are together we can tackle everything , she brought up her aunt again and how difficult the relationship and she was saying stuff that doesn't make any sense, i tried to reason with her and use logical approach to paint the bigger picture and finally she agreed on trying again and she told me now i need to do damage control because she thinks my image is tarnished for her aunt (which i don't understand if this is a philipino thing where aunts are hold in higher regards or what, she is not even her mom, i always tell her i only care about your mom and siblings) , she cares about my image and other people opinions and her aunt sayings.

then she sent me a text about this is your second chance and whatnot don't fk up or i won't offer friendship and i will block and forget. (as if it is easy to forget all those good memories and how happy she was with me) i told her don't sacrifice me and our relationship for other people's opinions we are building ourselves here step by step.

a couple of days after that she returned to not agreeing and on Thursday i tried offering her her favorite coffee on our lunch break, french vanilla with quarter-coffee as usual one for me and for her, she texted something weird like as a concerned friend yes but as a bf no, like wtf does that mean ?? , you just said couple of days ago you are okay with us together and she even called me babe and she said something like , if your brought me a gift or food this will end sooner (the drama i suppose) , i was acting on her words, and before that night i was crafting a surprise gift for her a bracelet with her faviorite color that says ""Always believe my special and the word Mahal"" , on Thursday October 3rd 2024 , in the lunch break it was akward moments she kept hitting my legs under the table gentley i didn't know what she wanted or mean and before that i told her you want to go get coffee i will buy , she said no with face, then i asked if we can go talk outside, she was walking slowly behind me and then the shocker she stood like 4 to 5 meters across of me , i told her why are you far way get close so we can hear eachother, the moment i started approaching her she started going backwards, as if i am a monster or godzilla , i didn't know what she did that..the conversation started okay and good , she was still not making any sense and saying drama things and how what i did shocked her and made her terrified and how her neck twisted and etc , which btw not true because no neck was twisted and she was perfectly fine , proof is we took pictures after that , her only concern was not the slight push but because infront of ""them"" and she herself said if as a friend you pushed me , i will push you back. so the push is not the cause issue.

then she started with non-chalant and i was nervious and reasoning and she was on another personality as if the girl i knew for 8 months is not there and it is another personality filled with stuff that doesn't make sense, then she started accusing me of having a temper and said in hindsight i knew , as if she tool time to really think of everything from a logical pov not emotional dramatic one.

then i got angry and she got angry and she started personal attacks, we said bad stuff to each other and the convo went to shit and after she blocked me on Messenger, unfollowed me on insta but left my number unblocked.

I just want to know if all of this is justified, am i a a monster ? , what about the overall good relationship we had for 8 months, what about what i made her feel the good? will she come back and realize that she was not thinking straight?

I want Filipino or other advice form guys and girls because i ran scenarios in my head and not one of them gave a valid logical reason for her to break up like this nor all of this to happen.

Thank you for reading all of that, it is very hard on me because i remember all the good times and i will add that she is not an evil vile person, in the contrary she is one of the sweetest person i have ever been with, it is not fair to let this relationship go to waste because of hormones or unlogical reasons.

Oh boy, it's Monday, and the coffee's hitting. Here's my idea for a one/two-shot (or even campaign):

The party (having no character sheets brought to the game) wakes up within the entrance of a dungeon, cave, forest, etc, having no knowledge of how they got there or even what their name is. They remember pulling a particular sword from its resting place within a stone, then after a bright light, everything became fuzzy. They believe they had a separate sword thay they brought into this place before the one they're holding. After all, they also have their shield with them, but they cannot seem to find it.

Also about the Hero is three other copies of themselves. All of which have different colored leather tunics than their own (the OGs are Green, Red, Blue, and Violet). 

Also a fun idea, the Four Sword has no real rule stating what gender each version must be, so your players can experiment with whatever ""branching personality from the main Hero"" they want to try. It could make sense either way!

Thus, the players must operate using the exact same character sheet, probably a Battlemaster Fighter, to comb through a dungeon. They may find weapons along the way that better suit their playstyle (wands, bows and arrows, etc) that flesh out their individual version of the Hero better. 

This could span a one-shot easily, but could also be a more involved campaign. What if completing this dungeon does not bring the Hero back together? What if there's a larger plot involved? How did the Hero end up in this dungeon, and how does it play into the larger plot?

Thank you all for reading! Looking forward to your thoughts. Apologies for any incoherencies; I had to brain dump this on my phone the moment the idea developed. 

TL;DR: What if we directly ported the Legend of Zelda Four Swords Adventures into D&D, using one character sheet for each player? Afterwards, we would proceed to give the party various magic items tjay differentiated their play styles until they formed their own variation of the Hero. Could this form a suitable campaign, or would this be better maintained as a one/two-shot?",1,1728307261.0,DnD,0,1.0,False

1fy7epe,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetprojectors/comments/1fy7epe/projector_acquired_but_needing_a_screen/,"Projector acquired, but needing a screen","Hi!

After some searching around and with u/PlayStationPepe's endorsement, I ended up buying an Epson EH-TW650 second-hand for ‚Ç¨300. I've since taken it home and set it up in my living room, and I realized pretty quickly that I will absolutely **need** a screen, because my wall is way too textured to create a smooth projection.

I'm looking for recommendations and/or inspiration for an (affordableü§û) screen solution for my projector. I would prefer a fixed-frame screen, because a pulldown screen seems like a lot more work, and it would have to come down pretty far to reach the projection. I've tried to do research into different materials, but I just ended up getting confused. My projector is rated at 3,100 ANSI lumens in normal mode, and about 1,900 in ECO mode (which I'll mostly be using), but I'm not sure what that means for the screen gain and material I should go for etc.. There's also the angle of the projection and the throw distance to keep in mind. The throw distance is about 2 meters now, so the projector is angled up pretty aggressively.

I've included a picture of the setup. The projector is on the bottom shelf of my coffee table, and -with some vertical keystone correction- I'm able to beam a projection of about 2 meters wide on my wall. The projection looks much better in a light-controlled setting, but that wasn't the point of this picture.

In the other picture, you can see my wall's texture. Needless to say, it doesn't result in a clear projection.

I may be able to move the projector back a bit further to create a 100"" projection, but I'd prefer not to. The viewing distance is about 3 meters, so this projection size is more than sufficient.

**Edit:** I can control the lighting of the room pretty well with dimout curtains, so there should be relatively little ambient light coming from anything other than reflected projector light on the white ceiling.

we were riding up to the room in the elevator. my mom was in the coffee shop in the lobby. there was an impossibly loud bang. my mom texted the groupchat ‚Äúdid you hear that???‚Äù all of us in the elevator were confused but figured it was just something falling down. maybe like a stack of chairs. 

we got off the elevator and my sister said ‚Äúit sounded like a gunshot but i didn‚Äôt want to scare those other people. i hope everyone is okay.‚Äù (i witnessed a shooting in this same area last summer so it wasn‚Äôt out of the realm of possibility.)

as we walked to our room, i pointed at the guard rail on the balconies overlooking the lobby. i said ‚Äúthey have those there so no one can kill themselves, ya know?‚Äù

as we got to the hotel room, my mom texted the group again. ‚ÄúIT WAS SOMEONE JUMPING. CONFIRMED DEAD BODY. HE FELL RIGHT ON TOP OF US.‚Äù

immediately we rushed back outside to peak over the balcony and see what we could see. he had jumped from five floors above us and fallen onto the atrium level, literally directly above the coffee shop. we didn‚Äôt see anything but an empty yellow gurney and some scattered people walking around the other balconies, taking videos or talking on the phone. the eeriest thing is how quiet it was. for the most part, it was business as usual. the world of the hotel just kept turning. 

ten years ago when i was 16 i was going to jump. i sat by myself at the top of a three story concrete stairwell for probably an hour, sobbing and feeling hopeless and aching for the freedom i would feel once i made the decision and just did it. i wanted to free fall and splatter. that feeling was so strong and i will never forget it. 

some other guests saw him jump and said he was staring over the railing by himself in silence for a while. they had no idea what he was gonna do. he didn‚Äôt scream or make a sound when he did it. the only sound was that bang, and he was whisked away so quickly. 

i didn‚Äôt even actually see anything but being there as it unfolded made me so sick to my stomach. i haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about him and how he must have felt standing all alone up there. i haven‚Äôt stopped thinking about how normal and quiet everything was. i can‚Äôt stop thinking about his body hitting the floor above my mom‚Äôs head. 

and the worst part is i‚Äôm thinking of jumping again. thinking about the release of just letting myself fall and not being able to back out. thinking about the relief of hitting the ground and having it all be over. idk what to do this is so hard and i can‚Äôt afford to see my therapist more often than our scheduled bi-weekly appointments. 

i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôm in danger of doing it but the feeling is unbearable. and i‚Äôm just so sad for that poor man who, last i read, hadn‚Äôt even been identified yet. ",8,1728306960.0,offmychest,1,0.9,False

Hi all,
15M, no dating experience.

Since I moved into S3 (June 2023) (year 3 of HS in Scotland), l've sat near and next to this kind, sweet girl in physics and maths. I‚Äôll call her F for now. Since about the start of 2024, we‚Äôve started to have prolonged conversations - mainly about school or traveling as that's what we have in common - and she has seemed genuinely interested 99% of the time. I help her with anything she needs and she helps me with anything I need. 

Just a few thoughts and questions though:
1.    I really like her, and I want to ask her out, but I don't know if there is anything the other way. 

2. How the hell do I ask her out and what do I do to convince her?
My thoughts currently are coffee at Starbucks, I know she loves it. 

If she says yes, probably not the best idea though: Studying together. My school is holding our first set of preliminary exams in late November to Early December and she has asked for help studying for 2 physics unit tests before. (which she has had her highest grades on, probably been a coincidence though). Would it be worthwhile to study as a pair as the relationship is solidifying?

3. I feel if she did say yes, I wouldn't be good enough for her. I don't know why I feel this way, it's just me. Spending a good amount of time together is a slight issue as well - busy till about 7pm Mon-Fri and busy all of Sunday.
I'm a worrier though, and overlook things a lot so this could just be a mental barrier.

4. One of her friends said that we would be great together and suit each other. Is this one of the reasons why I want her now?

My question is, is it better to:
*    Stay as just friends?
*    Shoot my shot?

Will add a bit of backstory into me and her below if anyone wants to know more, not right from the start of S3 though. If not, skip to the tl:dr.

Warning: I can get off topic below.


I had arrived at school early one morning last year. Me and one of her friends - let‚Äôs call her S - had to go to physics pretty early to charge some batteries. On the way up a flight of stairs, she says ‚ÄúYou know who I think you‚Äôd be great with?‚Äù 
S takes the piss a lot so I just randomly named someone from our year. S laughs, ‚ÄúNo! Honestly, you and F could work really well together. You seem to suit each other and get along well.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know her that well then, and at this point I felt very much on the spot. I said ‚ÄúErm, I‚Äôm not sure, I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be good enough‚Äù(maybe this is where that thought originated). She says something like ‚Äúoh you‚Äôll be fine,‚Äù after a bit more conversing, we laugh it off as we approach the classroom.
And that‚Äôs about as much as I can remember from that interaction. I think this is where my thoughts towards her could‚Äôve originated.

Maybe a few months later as we are coming up to our Energy & Electricity Assessment in phyiscs, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was playing golf with my Dad and his mates, I get a text on Snapchat come through from F asking for help on something from the unit. Potential dividers or something. I get home and I send her photos of my notebook with how to do what she asked. I send her the rest of the notebook as well to help further. She thanks me greatly and when the test rolls around the next day, she comes back with one mark off an A. 69% I think (68.5% rounded up). I‚Äôm not taking credit for it but I‚Äôd like to think I slightly contributed. 

The week after, I go away to Portugal. And while I‚Äôm there, my  mathematics teacher decides to give out homework for Thursday (it‚Äôs Wednesday). To add, my maths teacher is a very stereotypical Nigerian man, who emigrated to the uk the year before. At one point earlier in the year, he gave referrals to the headteacher, detentions after school for 3 days, and more to people for not doing or completing his one day notice homework in time. I used to be quite worried about that and when I got the news I wasn‚Äôt the happiest. I sort of just accepted that the aforementioned could happen until I get a message from F asking if I had completed it. I said ‚Äúno, he hasn‚Äôt sent it out online yet.‚Äù Surprisingly, she sends me the question paper with how to do what we were doing in class that week. And what do you know, about 20 minutes later I had an email to send to him and a few more hours free after school when I get back.

As small as it is, I think us going back and forward helping each other with anything we need (there‚Äôs been more than stated above but that‚Äôs all I can be bothered writing) has made me feel something between us. Not only that, she‚Äôs very kind and pretty. I think she‚Äôs the one.

Sorry if all that wasn‚Äôt relevant, I apologize for wasting your time.

Now the question. Is it better to just stay as friends or go for it? I‚Äôve thought it for a couple months now. Looked at both sides and I‚Äôm still on the fence. What should I do? And if possible, what advice can I get?

Thanks
:)

It‚Äôs Movie Week on Strictly and the first of ‚Äòtheme‚Äô weeks. Here we can get to see what hair, make up and wardrobe are really about ‚Äì and also who has peed them off and got the ~~crap~~ less well-refined outfits. HOTH and I went to see *Book of Mormon* this week which, safe to say, is highly unlikely to be turned into a film, never mind its songs being used in Movie Week on Strictly. The chances of it being used in Musicals Week are pretty slim, too. Shame. I can see someone like Carlos getting stuck into *‚ÄúYou and Me (But Mostly Me).‚Äù*

Saturday night saw Nick taking a bye as he‚Äôd injured himself *again* in training. He should have taken it last week to give him time to recover. So, *thirteen* couples brought us a variety of dances to a plethora of songs from a myriad of films. Some I‚Äôve not even heard of, never mind seen. There‚Äôs always a few where you know the song, but didn‚Äôt know it was used in a film. When you google or IMDB it, you usually find it was seventh in the closing tracks or summat. Mind you, anything would be better than The Sound of Music, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Mary Poppins for the trillionth time. Maybe we‚Äôd be luckier this year. By the way ‚Äì have you *read* Mary Poppins? Screenplay poetic licence doesn‚Äôt even begin to cover it. She was a gaslighting bully, pinching the kids‚Äô legs to shut them up, not a rosy-cheeked lovely with a song in her heart for everyone. And that‚Äôs not me casting a 21^(st) Century stance on it ‚Äì I‚Äôve read the books. Check it out if you don‚Äôt believe me. Evil, she is!

First, there was a ~~quite painful to watch~~ skit about Dave Arch nicking the glitterball. Thankfully, I was mostly spared this as HOTH decided to faff with the sound settings on the telly, so all I saw were the menu screens. They should just drop these ‚Äì they don‚Äôt add much or set the tone ‚Äì the skits, I mean, not TV menu screens. I suspect most viewers spent the time getting the nibbles and drinks ready.

Thankfully, the pro dance was more of a treat, with an unrecognisable Kai dressed as Gru being tormented by the rest of the cast dressed as many manic minions. Somehow, Neil looked exactly the same, just yellow. It was a suitably silly start to the evening and got us in the mood for what was to come.

**Kai, aye.**

On tripped the judges, suitably attired ‚Äì Craig looking quite dishy as Captain Jack Sparrow from *Pirates of the Caribbean*, Anton as the eponymous *Zoolander*, Motsi ‚Äì apparently as Whitney Houston‚Äôs character from *The Bodyguard* - looked more like the robot lady from Superman III if you ask me. And Shirley? Well, she flew in as Mary Sodding Poppins, didn‚Äôt she? I KNEW IT! Can‚Äôt go a bloody season without the bint. Poppins, that is, not Shirley. She kind of has to be there, what with her being Head Judge and all that. There was a bit of chatter with Tess and Claudia, and we were finally off.

**Motsi ‚Äì Queen of The Nightmare**

First on our stage for the night were **Montell** and **Johannes** with a **Tango** to **One Night Only** from¬†***Dreamgirls****.* Montell had admitted in her VT that she struggles to find her inner Diva and was advised ‚Äòwhen in doubt, smile it out‚Äô. Did it work? As Tangos ‚Ä¶ er ‚Ä¶ go, this wasn‚Äôt a bad effort. Montell had a lot of drive, attack and intent and there was enough drama in the choreography for a dozen divas. She covered the floor well, her feet were good and she managed the changes of pace, direction and transitions between ballroom and Latin moves pretty well. There seemed to be a wobble towards the end, though, and her frame started to tighten up, her elbows dropping and her head placement went wonky. Fair feedback from the judges, and tips for softening her knees, **28 out of 40** scored.

**My Inner Diva Asking If HOTH Has Finished In The Bloody Bathroom Yet**

Up next were ***T*****oyah and Neil** with their **Samba** to **Poor Unfortunate Souls** from ***The Little Mermaid***. Oooft. That wouldn‚Äôt be Strictly Senior Management having a sly dig now, would it? And who are the Poor Unfortunate Souls ‚Äì Toyah & Neil or us at home being forced to watch it? I can‚Äôt fault Toyah‚Äôs performance and characterisation as film baddie Ursula. The rest of the dance I can, though. Actually, that‚Äôs not fair. She had better timing this week, she tried hard with the steps and she seemed to have listened to Neil a bit about staying on the beat. The rest of it? Well. Despite spending a good third of the dance cavorting behind an octopus (that‚Äôs not a euphemism),Toyah went wrong more than once, she had no bounce, sway or rhythm and there was no isolation or rotation in her hips. A mermaid would have had better footwork, too. The panel weren‚Äôt impressed and her score plummeted to **15 out of 40**.

**Toyah Flounders At The Bottom Of The Sea-derboard**

Following this, a little ditty, ‚Äòbout **Chris and Dianne**¬†who went back up-tempo with a **Jive** to the ***Wayne‚Äôs World***¬†theme. The pair definitely got the Party On with this number. Hats off to Dianne, who is a fantastic teacher, but hats, gloves, scarves and coats off to Chris as a pupil. Wow. From the off, Chris‚Äô jive action was good, his kick-ball-changes decent and his timing and sync with Dianne was truly excellent. He lost a little balance in the kicks and flicks on occasion, and his retraction could have been a tad sharper. He started to run out of steam towards the end which led to a couple of teeny errors but, overall, it was a good outing and fun to watch. The judges agreed (with Shirley praising Chris‚Äô soft jive knees and toe-heel swivel) and **30 out of 40** was awarded.

**Are You Sure You Want Me To Drive, Dianne?**

Slowing things down were **Tasha and Alja≈æ** with their **Rumba** to a stripped back, acoustic **What Was I Made For?** from¬†***Barbie***. Urgh. Rumba. They could have done a Charleston to Barbie Girl by Aqua for flip‚Äôs sake! It seems couples are trying to get it out of the way as soon as possible this year. Actually, this wasn‚Äôt the most awful rumba I‚Äôve seen on Strictly ‚Äì Shirley reckons it was better than some of the people she‚Äôd just judged in the World Championships ‚Äì especially as the pair had managed only four days‚Äô training and there was no beat for Tasha to feel to assist her dancing. With Aljaz looking more like a *Mike Flowers Pops* tribute act than Ken, Tasha sashayed up a storm in this light, airy, romantic number. She had lovely, lyrical limbs with beautifully balanced spins and turns. Her extensions were exquisite and her core was strong and controlled. The transitions were a little jagged, spoiling the flow a bit but, overall, this was <grits teeth> pretty good. **34 out of 40** from the panel.

**Life‚Äôs A Beach For** **~~Ken~~** **Alja≈æ**

Still no ballroom routine for **Paul and Karen** who yet again drew the music-to-moves short straw, getting lumbered with a **Cha Cha** to the theme from ***The Magnificent Seven***. Yeah. That‚Äôs what I thought until the music started and they‚Äôd changed the iconic tune into a Cha Cha seemingly played on a Bontempi organ. Give the poor bloke a break and stop using him as this year‚Äôs comedy foil. You‚Äôve got to admire Paul for trying ‚Äì he could just flounce around with the barest nod to a routine and play it all for laughs. I mean, I still laughed, but there was an attempt at a Cha Cha in there. Somewhere. He had a go at some tricky steps and his footwork had improved. His cowboy character was good and he tried to master the technique. Hmm. What else positive? Ermm. His hat was nice? Sadly, the life-sized plastic horse props had better hip movement and Paul was somehow ahead and behind the beat *at the same time*, which takes some doing. Even with Karen frantically dancing around his, there was no distracting from the fact that this was a struggle for Paul. Even with some wild overmarking from ‚ÄòI liked it‚Äô Tony Beak, just **19 out of 40** on the paddles.

**Paul Has A Mare With The Cha Cha**

Flying in from the wings were **Sarah and Vito** with a **Viennese Waltz** to **Hedwig‚Äôs Theme** from ***Harry Potter***. So, a slower, calmer more nuanced dance to the previous weeks was on the cards, dedicated to the incredible Dame Maggie Smith, who passed away this week. And Dame Maggie could not have asked for a better tribute. Sarah, who surely has to be a top contender for the Glitter Ball trophy was a wonderous whirlwind of waltz as she wound her way around the floor. Solid both in and out of hold she mastered event the trickiest of steps (a reverse turn into a reverse pivot if you‚Äôre interested) with confidence. There were huge, sweeping turns and spins and Sarah was as light on her feet as a Wingardium Leviosa‚Äôd feather. Not everything was perfect ‚Äì she didn‚Äôt close / cross her feet on every occasion, there were patches of rise and fall and her head placement was dodgy ‚Äì leading to lessons from Shirl‚Äôs Tiny Shoes and Anton‚Äôs Fellowship of the Frame. All good feedback for a spellbinding performance. Accio **33 out of 40**!

**Sarah In The Dance Off? You Cannot Be Sirius**

Enter Stage Left, **Pete and Jowita** with another **Samba**, this time to the ***George of the Jungle*** theme. Now, I‚Äôve not seen this film. Reading the premise that might be a Good Thing. I can‚Äôt understand why Daniel Day Lewis wasn‚Äôt pleading with his agent to get him the role. I‚Äôm being mean ‚Äì it might be a wonderful romp. So, as I gather, George of the Jungle is a handsome, muscly bloke who is utterly clueless out of his comfort zone. In this routine, he‚Äôs represented by Pete, a handsome, muscly bloke who ‚Ä¶ hang on a minute! I‚Äôm sensing a theme here. Okay, so the character might not be too far of a stretch for him, but I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised to say neither was this dance. If there was a weekly prize for Most Improved it would surely go to Mr Wicks. Dressed in a ‚Ä¶ fetching ‚Ä¶ leopard-print outfit, Pete began his routine on the Judges‚Äô desk, gyrating his bottom in front of a giggling Craig. His many, many tattoos on show, Pete swung into Samba action, giving it proper. He definitely had some Samba hip action, his frame and leading were better and he gave us character with tongue very firmly in his cheek. It was a bit stop / start ‚Äì work is still needed in his transitions ‚Äì and he and the beat parted ways on occasion, but Jowita had put in some technical moves and steps. Alright, one nearly resulted in him tripping Jowita up, but this was a lot of fun to watch. Whether or not his posterior added to the points, the pair scored a whopping **26 out of 40**.

**Wicks You Were Here?**

**JB and Amy** swooped after Pete with an **American Smooth** to **Pure Imagination** from¬†***Wonka****.* JB and Amy had gone chocolate-making for their VT, which reminded me of a team building day I once went on. One of my colleagues asked if it we could dress down (eg wear our normal clothes) and the boss told him ‚ÄòDress down, dress up, I don‚Äôt care‚Äô. So my colleague turned up in a Spider-Man muscle costume. Serve you right, Boss. Anyway ‚Äì nary a superhero costume in sight for JB and Amy with this routine. Unlike some of the others, JB listens to the Judges‚Äô feedback and showed more improvement this week. His frame was neater with no gapping, his bottom was nicely tucked under and his shoulders less hunched. He coped well with the lifts, easing Amy into and out of them fairly seamlessly and the pair told a nice, whimsical story. There‚Äôs still some bits to iron out ‚Äì JB needs to take longer strides when leading Amy, there‚Äôs still some balance issues and, probably most important of all ‚Äì he needs to remember to breathe! A routine may only be 90 seconds but that‚Äôs a long time when you‚Äôre strutting your stuff. The Oompa-Loompas, sorry, Panel were happy and gave **32 out of 40** ‚Äì JB‚Äôs present of chocolate clearly working on Anton, who gave a nine.

**No Truffle Shuffle For JB**

**Sam and Nikita** powered through a **Paso Doble** to **Elevation** from¬†***Tomb Raider***. See what I mean about not knowing it was in a film? I dunno, maybe it was in a montage ‚Äì it‚Äôs another one I‚Äôve not seen. This was a quite decent little routine which saw Sam as Leggy Legend Lara Croft and Nikita as Nasty ‚Ä¶ Cold if he doesn‚Äôt put a jumper on and cover his chest! Sam abseiled into the dance with some very nice flamenco shaping in her arms. There was good connection with Nikita and you could tell he‚Äôd been working hard on her titeres. What? It‚Äôs a Paso step, you naughty people! Sam had lots of attack, drive and intent but her limbs were a bit loose which impacted the drama and purpose required for a Paso. Her legs were too straight in parts, but her lines were good overall and she tried hard to sell the character. Another celeb who‚Äôs showing improvement week on week, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs in danger of going home soon with a score of **30 out of 40.**

https://preview.redd.it/apekbknv1ctd1.png?width=468&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e62389207bb9cfe240c019f3e90b4c2f326c510

**Sam and Nikita ‚Äì Jolie a Deux**

Also vying for **Viennese** Votes were **Shayne** **and** **Nancy** who danced to **If I Can Dream** from¬†***Elvis*****.** As if I needed to tell you that. Mind you, looking at Shayne‚Äôs outfit it would have been hard to tell. He was less The King and more Robbie Rotten from *Lazytown*. Guess we could tell who‚Äôd upset the wardrobe staff, then. It was a good dance, though. Shayne had his rise and fall under control and he managed to avoid skipping through the turns and spins, which some male celebs have struggled with. While a bit light on character for me, it was packed with content and the steps were far from basic. He closed his feet nicely, he led Nancy well and he was bang on the beat with his timing. Again, though, he had some framing issues, being a bit too far forwards at times, looming over his partner and that chin was jutting again. The Judges loved it, though, with Craig declaring it ‚ÄòGawjus‚Äô and Motsi saying Shayne was the best male dancer of the night so far. Then he fell upstairs! A generous 9 from Motsi gave the couple **33 out of 40**.

**No Tens For Shayne ‚Äì He Was Robbied**

Where wardrobe had short-changed Shayne, **Wynne‚Äôs** outfit meant he could really *channel his inner* ***Mrs Doubtfir*****e** with his and **Katya‚Äôs Cha Cha** to **Papa‚Äôs Got a Brand New Bag**. Now, some ~~wazzocks~~ people have been rewatching that film with 21^(st) Century eyes and bapping on that it‚Äôs not *really* the wholesome story it was sold as. That Mrs Doubtfire was a controlling piece of work who Done Piers Brosnan Wrong. Look. Just stop, eh? It‚Äôs not Dostoyevsky. It doesn‚Äôt need navel gazing analysis. It‚Äôs not a documentary. It‚Äôs the late, extraordinarily talented (and much-missed) Robin Williams in one of his most iconic roles. Stop trying to make everyone and everything miserable! Sorry, got on me soapbox there for a minute. Anyway, Wynne fair made me forget all that negativity with his fun, cheering take on the character, hoovering up the love from the audience in the studio and at home with his larger than life performance. With excellent choreo from Katya this was a cracking dance that brought the house down. From flashing his bloomers to putting out boob fires, Wynne went for it. He had bags of energy from the get-go with fabulous rhythm and musicality, matching Katya in the side-by-side sections and even carrying of some difficult ‚Äòquestion and answer‚Äô moves. His feet were properly turned out, he finished his lines and he looked like he was having the time of his life. There were a few problems with his hips ‚Äì they lacked some rotation and isolation ‚Äì but, apparently, he had brilliant guapacha timing (pronounced summat like WhopperChaw). You have NO idea how many spelling attempts I had on Google trying to get that. My browsing history is going to be interesting for a while. Crowd pleasing and Judge pleasing, the pair got **30 out of 40**.

**Ain‚Äôt No Doubt Wynne Got Fire**

Movie Week also saw an early outing of a **Couple‚Äôs Choice** ‚Äì which doesn‚Äôt usually make an appearance until at least mid-series. **Punam** **and** **Gorka** took their turn in the spotlight dancing to beloved Bollywood bhangra banger **Bole Chudiyan** from¬†***Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham*****.** In an absolute first for Strictly, and Gorka of course, we were treated to some great Indian dancing. Punam looked gorgeous in a Strictlyfied Indian dance costume, with her partner suitably attired in a sequinned sherwani. I loved this dance ‚Äì so refreshingly different from the Street Dance, Fosse or Contempowaft styles we usually see. They could get rid of Couple‚Äôs Choice and replace it with Traditional Dance for me ‚Äì imagine Neil getting to grips with Morris Dancing. Now, I‚Äôm not an expert on ~~anything~~ Indian dance, but this routine was a jaw-dropper. Punam danced with passion, full of joy and exhilaration as she coped magnificently with scarfography, smart switches of pace, beat and direction, difficult moves and shaping. The storytelling was on point and the whole thing brought a smile to my face. Shirley cooed it was ‚ÄòSupercalifragilisticexpialidocious‚Äô and Motsi was moved to tears. A very good **33 out of 40** scored.

**Bolly Good Show, Punam**

**Jamie and Michelle** finished the show with a quirky **Quickstep** to Elton John‚Äôs classic **I‚Äôm Still Standing** from¬†***Rocketman***. Or, if you‚Äôve seen the Lockdown Video, I‚Äôb Dill Danding. Poor Elton sounded like a bloke down the pub doing karaoke with a bad sinus infection. Thankfully, Dave Arch‚Äôs singers fared better. Jamie, looking oddly like the love child of Timmy Mallett and Ethel Merman, cavorted around the dancefloor like a toddler on a cocktail of 90s Sunny D and Haribo. While he had pretty good rhythm, stamina and energy, it was all a bit frantic, frenetic, even messy. The side-by-side jive style sections were in sync but Jamie lost consistency, particularly getting in and out of hold where his frame went floppy, his lines loose and his shoulders shapeless. He definitely sold his character, playing up as Elton used to, but he‚Äôs done better dances, and he knew it. **30 out of 40** from Craig and chums.

Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt get to see **Nick** **and Luba** facing the footlights with their **Charleston** to **Rain on the Roof** from¬†***Paddington 2,*** so we‚Äôll never know if it was Paddington and The Rail Replacement Bus To Bermondsey or not. With the curtain closing and the popcorn being swept from the floor, the Box Office Leaderboard looked like this:

And so to the Sunday Results Show. HOTH and I had enjoyed a lovely hurkle durkle in bed. Oi, less of that! It‚Äôs actually a Scottish phrase meaning: to lie in bed or lounge about when one should be up and about. For us, it‚Äôs breakfast and coffees while watching TV shows about fixing vintage electronics or making toys. This is twenty years of marriage, people!

The show opened with Tess somewhat ominously standing in front of the gathered couples letting us know ‚Äì as if we didn‚Äôt already ‚Äì that the dance off was imminent. The poor sods then had to stand there while we went through the whole recap of the show and the Judges‚Äô huddle. Oh, wait. That will have been added later. They were probably only standing there about twenty seconds. As you were.

Without any further preamble, we were into the first announcement of the evening. Blimey. That was a bit quick. But all was okay - ¬†Tess Delay took her sweet time, as usual, ramping up the tension. Tension? There‚Äôs more tension in me knicker elastic. Annoying, is what it is. A billion millennia after she started, we finally found that the couple first in the dance off was ‚Ä¶

**PAUL AND KAREN**

Smelling salts were unopened and my attack of the vapours remained unmanifested when this was announced. As much as Paul is fun to watch, he‚Äôs not exactly up there is he, bless him? With advice from Craig to try to add some more hip action and sell the routine, off they popped for a hot Vimto and a packet of Salt n Shake Crisps (disclaimer, I have no idea what they did, but this sounds like something I‚Äôd do, so there you go. I‚Äôm projecting. ‚ÄòCos it‚Äôs Movie Week ‚Ä¶ no? I‚Äôll get me coat).

Up in the Clauditorium we had a break-neck blether with the first bunch of saved souls. Apparently, Gorka has Punam on speed dial for his kids‚Äô ailments, Sam thinks waiting for her name to be called is worse than waiting to see if she‚Äôs in the GB Hockey Squad, JB is bringing everyone apples and pears from his farm and Tasha makes Alja≈æ smile all day, every day. Which must be hell on his cheek muscles.

**Alja≈æ Grins And Bears It**

Oh, and poor Nikita can‚Äôt tell one Shakira song from another, belting out the wrong one for his announcement for next week‚Äôs number. I have never seen a bloke go so red!

In a change to usual proceedings THEN there was the pro dance, instead of right the top of the show where it usually is. Maybe they had a problem with the recording or something. They shouldn‚Äôt really have bothered, if you ask me. It was all a bit ‚Ä¶ meh ‚Ä¶ after all the others. Beige Neil channel surfing, unlucky in love, sees the lurved up others, catches Dianne, cut to Neil in pink suit. The end.

Another unnecessary bit with the Judges on the new semi-circle sofa then it was back to Business As Usual. Because we were unlikely to be able to handle any more excitement, things ~~ground to a halt~~ slowed down while Madame Molasses delivered the terrible truth that couple number two in danger was ‚Ä¶

**TOYAH AND NEIL**

Well, colour me pink and call me Doreen. That was a shock. Me, sarcastic? Never! One did not need to be Septic Peg to see this one coming. It was probably about as inevitable as Monday following Sunday, or someone skriking about their ‚Äòjourney‚Äô on X-Factor. Let‚Äôs just say I didn‚Äôt drop my knitting. Mainly because I wasn‚Äôt doing any, but you get the idea.

**Toyah Gets Taken Down A Peg Or Two**

Back with Cackling Claud, we learned Jamie does a terrible impression of Shirley while lying down with Michelle. Apparently NOT like that ‚Äì and the poor lamb thought they would edit his gaffe out. Jamie, my love, it‚Äôs ‚Äòlive‚Äô! We also found out that Celebrity MasterChef winner Vito (is there no end to his perfection?) brings food in for everyone. I must say his parmigiana sounded more inviting than a nibble on JB‚Äôs Cox‚Äôs Pippins. Shayne takes notes of everything everyone says to him ‚Äì I bet he doesn‚Äôt scribble *my* comments down ‚Äì and his daughter is voting for Montell, who is putting JoJo through his paces. Do keep up!

The fantastic Professional Ivory Tickler Alexis Ffrench treated us to a beautiful rendition of *The Heart Asks Pleasure* from that fun-fest of a film, *The Piano*. I know I‚Äôm doing it a disservice but, my word, it was a downer. Unlike Alexis‚Äô playing, which was simply divine. He‚Äôs also a judge on this year‚Äôs BBC Young Musician Of The Year, which is very much worth a watch. Previous winners include the magnificent Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who I‚Äôd listen to playing a Jive Bunny remix, if I‚Äôm honest.

What? Yes, yes. I AM procrastinating. I haven‚Äôt forgotten the Dance Off. I wish I could, but there you go.

Toyah and Neil were on the dance floor first. If anything, this outing was even worse. Toyah lolloped around like a stunned mullet, with Neil seeming to drag her round like a drunken auntie at a wedding. She seemed to forgo the steps in place of hamming up the character, mugging and gurning throughout the routine instead of concentrating on timing, balance, rhythm and, well, the whole flipping thing.

Paul and Karen, however, made an altogether better attempt at their dance. Paul seemed more relaxed, enjoying playing up to Karen and having fun with this character. There was more hip action and energy, better rhythm and, crucially, fewer mistakes.

You don‚Äôt really need me to tell you, do you? There was no split decision or Head Judge Casting Vote needed this week as the panel unanimously decided to send home

**TOYAH AND NEIL**

The pair should really have gone last week, in my opinion. Toyah may have been enjoying herself, but she wasn‚Äôt learning or improving. Poor Neil. Maybe one day the Strictly Gods will be kind and he‚Äôll get a decent partner ‚Äì unless they‚Äôre setting him up to be Anton 2 (Electric Boogaloo). Who knows?

And there we have it ‚Äì another week over, another week closer to the Final. Fingers crossed Nick will have recovered enough to compete again. Although, and I know you‚Äôre all going to be bereft, there WON‚ÄôT be a Strictly Blog from me next week. There, there, you‚Äôll be *fine*! I‚Äôm having a very much deserved spa weekend with my lovely lady chums. The week after that, though? You better believe I‚Äôll be here!

Until then, my little ballroom botherers ‚Ä¶..

1fy77v9,https://www.reddit.com/r/latebloomerlesbians/comments/1fy77v9/moving_forward_past_relationships_regret_advise/,"Moving forward, past relationships, regret. Advise, related stories, community? ","I have been searching reddit for months hoping to find something similar to my situation. I don't know if I'm looking for validation, a community, advise, etc. I don't know what I am hoping for in posting this, probably a combination of all the above. 

  
I 27F, now know that I am attracted to women, but also currently dating men and have only ever dated men. I have had experiences with women. At the time, I didn't believe I was bi/lesbian. I thought that I was drunk, having fun, whatever. I was stupid and likely inconsiderate of my own and obviously other people's feelings. 

  
Anyways, I am writing this because I feel haunted by a relationship I had with a specific woman, now 2 years ago. Not an actually defined relationship, more so on and off hooking up for 3 years. Close friendship. An insane connection where I felt seen, heard, and appreciated. She's out as a lesbian. 

  
I have had an entire self realization journey since that friendship has dissipated. While the friendship was occurring, I would never have admitted that I was bi/lesbian despite actively hooking up with her and openly expressing feelings towards the end. I will add a horrible, forever-regretful piece of context to this as well.  At the time, I had a long term boyfriend of multiple years throughout the entire thing with her. I already live with the extreme guilt from this situation, I don't need people to tell me how horrible I was for that. I already know. I also was so oblivious to her having feelings for me. I thought she also only wanted to hook up. There was obviously more to this than just hooking up, and I felt that at the time, but I was oblivious to my own feelings, let alone hers. 

  
We would spend nights having the most intimate feeling interactions. I don't know if it felt so intimate to me because it was my first true experience with a woman outside or drunkenly making out with friends in high school and college. Or being hyper-sexualized by men and encouraging sexual interactions with other women. We would spend the entire night talking about everything from somewhat trivial things to the deepest parts of our life experiences, mixed in with being intimate. I knew that she cared about me, but at the time, I had a hard time seeing it as anything else but in a friendship kind of way. I also struggled with this situation, because most if not all of the interactions, we were both drunk. I thought it was something she liked to do when she was drunk. I thought she liked my attention when she was drunk, but didn't want that at any other time. Outside of this, we would hang out as friends. Trips with other friends. Nights out drinking (usually ended in us together). Dinner. Bring me breakfast and coffee. Lunches. Hiking. You get the picture. 

At one point, she had a girlfriend. It didn't last very long. I hung out with them a couple times. I didn't like her for obvious reasons. She told me later that she knew I didn't like her for that reason.  

I knew she was upset or uncomfortable that I had a boyfriend. She would make small comments here and there about it. ""Oh, you're still with him,"" etc. We had even hung out all together. I told him what I had done on several occasions. That's an entirely different situation. At one point, he saw us making out in the middle of a bar. Obviously he was upset. The last time we saw each other, she asked about him and I lied. When we were drunk, hooking up, and talking, she acknowledge that she knew I was lying about not being with him.  

I'm being so honest when I say even when I remember things now that she would say, that I did not take them for face value. She told me various times that she liked me, sober, but would say something like so minor like ""I like you"". I would just laugh or shrug it off because I thought she was joking or trying to make me laugh or saying it in a friendship kind of way. I'm not going to lie, it did make me slightly uncomfortable at the time, not because of what she was saying, but because of the deep rooted issues I had within myself with my confusion about my sexuality and having a boyfriend. I also wasn't sure the way she meant it. 

Now that I reflect on the situation, there were some not obvious moments of her letting onto her feelings. Again, I was so oblivious. I didn't think she ACTUALLY liked me. I thought she was just saying those things in a heightened emotional state. And honestly she might have been. 

This went on for 2 ish years while we lived in the same town. 

I moved away. I went to visit her a few times. Every time, we fell back into the same pattern. Hooking up. Expressing feelings. But when we woke up the next day, nothing. It started to take more of a toll on me in the last year. I started to acknowledge my feelings, but was still entirely confused. In the last year, she told me she loved me multiple times, but only when she was drunk. At this point, I knew it wasn't in a light hearted way, but I also was so confused because it was only ever when she was drunk. I said it back every time. I would wake up and feel so much shame, but not because of her, because of the situation I was putting people through. 

The last time, we had probably went a year from the previous time of seeing each other. I was in town for another reason, but reached out to see if she wanted to hangout. We did with some other friends. I stayed with her. Same thing as always. Same routine. This time felt so different to me. I don't know if it was because of the time between our last interaction, or because it actually was different. She kept telling me she loved me while we were hooking up and talking multiple times throughout the night. She begged me to admit that I loved her. I did admit it. I told her I have for years. So much reciprocated words of love were shared between us that night. We woke up in the morning and hooked up again, for the first time sober. We had made out or things sober, but never the intimate and emotional conversations. Hung out like normal the next day. I felt like something was off. I stayed one more night and left the following day. 

I felt an enormous rush of guilt, sadness, emotion, I don't know as I was driving home. I loved her. I decided I was going to try to talk about the things we talk about in our drunken nights, while on my way home. I sent her a text explaining that it was eating at me to continue doing this and I wanted her in my life in a more significant way. I was ready to leave my boyfriend. She responded and basically said that there had been various times in our friendship that she wishes I would've admitted this, etc. but that it was too late and it wasn't the right time. I was crushed. This was the start of my emotional fall, breaking up with my boyfriend, moving out. I was so tore up about it for months. Debilitating depression, not eating, not doing things I normally loved. 

What eats at me the most is trying to understand why she would beg me to admit that I loved her, then completely cutting the entire situation off the following day, forever. I feel like I lack closure from the situation, but I also know I am not owed that here, although it still hurts. After those last texts, I sent her a few random light hearted things a few months apart with no response. Her friend told me she seemed sad for a while after I left/texted her. 

Maybe she was done being hurt by me, or maybe it wasn't as serious as I had perceived it as. Maybe she thought I was never going to leave and respected herself enough to set that boundary. I just can't grasp expressing so much mutual love for each other to then ending it. 

  
Now that it is over, I haven't talked to her for 2 years. I have a new boyfriend. I think about her every single day. So many things remind me of her. I really miss her. Even just our friendship. I think about a life involving her more than I'd like to admit. It's almost as if I have 2 scenarios in my brain of how my life could go. I sometimes wonder if I would've fully explored that situation if I would feel this way years later. I grovel with regret from not being true to myself in the moment, but I also just can't stop thinking about her. I wish I had the nerve to speak up sooner. I wish I would've asked more questions. So many regrets. 

I know this whole post is probably absurd and I don't even know what I am hoping to get from it. Probably advise, people having similar stories, community. Who knows. It felt nice to type this out, but I'm still extremely scared of pressing the post button.  I was hoping time would dissipate some of these feelings, but it really hasn't. I'm afraid I will live the rest of my life with this hole of regret. ",3,1728306570.0,latebloomerlesbians,0,0.8,False

Speak a Little Italian.¬† You're going to Italy, learn the 10 or so most common phrases, Buongiorno - good morning, Buona sera - good evening or good afternoon, Mi scusi ‚Äì excuse me, Grazie ‚Äì thank you or Grazie Mille - thank you very much, Bagno - bathroom.¬† Ciao is informal for tourists is not used as often you may think.¬† Always begin your conversation and end your conversation in Italian (Buongiorno ‚Ä¶ Grazie). You'll be surprised how many tourist-facing people speak English well in Florence and Rome.¬† Do not say Ma'am.¬† This is a Midwest polite thing but not appreciated in Italy. (I was quickly corrected by young lady serving gelato.) ¬†

Coffees are the thing. All sorts of coffees! ¬†All day long!¬† Figure out what you like to order ahead of time, not in line.¬† You won't see people walking around with a paper cup of coffee in their hand like you see in US cities.¬† Drink it there in the shop.¬† Also, you won‚Äôt see people eating or drinking on the go either.¬† Gelato was the only exception we saw.¬†

No Diet Coke in Italy! ¬†Full strength Coke or Coke Zero.¬† Apparently, it‚Äôs an EU thing. You‚Äôll have to just settle for Aperol Spritz ‚Äì bummer, I know!!¬† Plastic bottle caps do not separate from the bottle and will stay connected. Again, it's an EU thing.¬†

Shoes.¬† Wear well-fitting and cushioned sneakers. Leather shoes are seldom worn and will hurt. Heals will kill you.¬† Rome and Florence streets where tourists walk are, are paved with 12cm x 12cm black basalt stone with gaps to facilitate drainage (called ‚Äúsampietrini‚Äù). Essentially square cobble stones. Cute but uncomfortable. Dragging luggage will be sporting, so make sure your luggage has sturdy (large) wheels.¬† We had Travel Pro luggage which did fine but if you have smaller wheels you'll be in trouble.¬† We did see several lost and lonely luggage wheels along the way.

Money and Contactless ‚ÄòMachines‚Äô. ¬†Both Rome and Florence were mostly cashless.¬† We got 150 EUR which was fine for eight days in Italy.¬† The ATMs in the Rome airport baggage are safe places to get money (Thanks, Fabulous).¬† You will not be handing over your credit card to a waiter or shop clerk.¬† Instead, they will hand you a portable contactless machine for you to tap your card.¬† If you don‚Äôt see one, ask for a ‚Äòmachine‚Äô.¬† Some machines may give you an option of charging in EUR or US Dollars.¬† Always, pick EUR because you don‚Äôt know the vendor‚Äôs bank conversion rate will be for EUR to Dollars.¬† Let your bank at home figure it out and it will likely be the best rate.¬† We used Galaxy smart watches with Google Wallet app which worked most of the time.¬† This saves you from dragging out your wallet to get your card.¬† NB: Make sure your bank card does not charge a ‚ÄòForeign Transaction Fee‚Äô.¬†

I didnt want to give him money because I wasnt sure if I support an addiction but since he looked so thin I thought I would give some food.

Have those dark nights of the soul where if you get through it you might have an emotional hangover thinking you've done some horrible things, but you haven't actually... you merely thought horrible things all night long?

And maybe you don't even sleep enough, like 4 hours, but you get through the next day with coffee and it feels sort of like you reset abdominal are finally back to yourself for the first time in months, not dissociated?

Almost as if the sleep was a bad thing you had to get rid of? 

I used to feel like this when I was younger, after I would have a night of drinking. I would feel more relaxed and in the moment the next day. Even if I felt sick. But now it happens I don't know once or twice a year without drinking.

I feel like I've read that OMAD is not good if the goal is losing fat. I think it was that old ""slowing down the metabolism"" thing. But I think I heard it from Jason Fung who I respect.

I've lost about 8kg and have approx 20-25kg more to lose (will judge it as I get closer). I'm on Contrave which reduces cravings and between that and IF I've found the weight coming off fairly easily so far. Some weeks not much lost and some weeks a bit more than I would have expected.

I've always done a bit of IF, mostly 16/8 or 18/6 with occasional 20/4 and OMAD. I tend to go with whatever suits me on the day. A few weeks ago I had some days when I felt quite hungry so I ate a lot and then I intentionally did OMAD the following day to try to balance it out.   The past couple of weeks I noticed I was naturally  doing some 20/4 but mostly OMAD because it suits my lifestyle better.  I'm not super-strict about fasting as I drink tea/coffee with milk during the fasting period. Not a lot though and nothing else except water.

I know it's not ideal but I haven't been focussing on nutrition or counting calories, just having whatever I feel like and eat till I feel full. I view this as a stage I'm going through while I ease into weight loss (and overall healthier living)  and later on will bring more focus to the nutrition.

I'm interested in hearing your thoughts on OMAD and fat loss. Also any recommendations for reading material or videos on the subject.  Thank you.

[\\""The Pussycat Cometh\\""](https://preview.redd.it/94qbssq7zbtd1.png?width=225&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff5beabfcdbe605a069791ed57354c4f895feb62)

After some nice play in the price on Friday, good ol' Stonk is set-up for some trend continuation - but what happens after that? In addition to my usual analytics, I'm going to talk a bit about the November OPEX options chain structure, its relation to Sneeze 1.0 and 2.0, and what it might enable as we move out of the October Quarterly OPEX period. Let's go!

**Price Movement Recap**

Unlike some of our price action earlier in the week, Friday's outsized orders - both bullish and bearish - were, in fact, organic market sentiment. This is to say that dynamic purchase or sale events were easily identifiable in the data and did not emerge out of nowhere.

[10\/4 Trading Day 1-min Aggregation](https://preview.redd.it/vc5kf3s0wbtd1.png?width=1170&format=png&auto=webp&s=1280c69565a446d5c47a1edfcede6edecc503cf5)

Our upward volatility early appears to have been institutionally stimulated in response to jobs news. As I identified in Friday's premarket post, the possibility for upward volatility was already built into the options structure heading into the close on Thursday. There were several larger orders that came through on the day that had the opportunity to set off similar upward volatility events like we saw at open. However, there just wasn't enough trader/institutional attention on the stock at this moment to ride these orders into a greater payoff.

For example, at 1:03pm EDT, a single trader came in with a large order (\~$700k in premium) of $20 11/15 calls. This single order caused the stock to launch a full $0.26 solely on the MM hedging response. The same is true at 2:38pm, where a large number of $21 Puts were purchased at the ASK, causing MM hedging to sell the stock rapidly and push the price downward into the close. 

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

The 10/11 weekly expiry is interesting and a bit unusual versus our recent weekly expiries. In the case of 10/4 and 9/27, we had some sizable upward volatility events on each of the Fridays before expiry and enough distance between these Fridays and October OPEX to cause significant OI accumulation for the weekly expiries themselves. Trading Day 10/4 hosted no such volume or upward volatility events and is only 14DTE from OPEX. Thus, 10/11 expiry OI is comparatively smaller.  


[10\/11 OI Changes 10\/4-10\/7](https://preview.redd.it/ss92b713gbtd1.png?width=1857&format=png&auto=webp&s=936903f234027e27ad54d33f73ed15d481e2fb83)

As we can see above, the new OI patterns suggest short-term movement that aligns with our continued movement down into the $20.50-$21 range. $21 is Put OI heavy at a ratio of 5:1, while $20.50, otherwise an unassuming strike on the half-dollar, has about double the Call OI as other half-dollar strikes and is shifted in favor of Calls at $20.50 at a ratio of a little over 2:1. As we'll see below, this doesn't tell the whole story for our gamma hedge landscape thanks to the large GEX positions projected by OPEX OI, but it is worth noting these ratios in terms of short-term trader sentiment. 

With Max Pain for this week currently at $21, it seems likely that traders will be preparing for some midweek bearishness, but overall stagnation as MMs will be incentivized to guide the price such that the large accumulation of $21 Puts expire OTM.  


[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/4-10\/7](https://preview.redd.it/ss8c9jkufbtd1.png?width=1856&format=png&auto=webp&s=6473dc7c177fe35f197a2c89cdc395fe1e5e1eba)

For October OPEX, our key OI levels are identical to those we've see recently. $20 sits as a high-Call, high-Put OI level as lower support unlikely to be breached via standard intraday price action. $21 into October OPEX is slanted in favor of Calls at a 5:3 ratio. Together with this week's $21 OI it will still stand out as a mildly gamma net-negative position, but aims to be much less of downward pull from next Monday into OPEX itself. $22 is a key inflection and mid range overhead. Based on the proximity of this strike to our current price position, these calls still preserve a significant amount of extrinsic value and will be popular for traders to lob back and forth with each other. At the same time MMs will be highly incentivized to keep the price below $22 into 10/11 expiry. $25 still sits as major upside resistance and Call Wall overhead.

At the same time, as we approach October Quarterly OPEX it is in our interest to examine how the options market is setting up for next month - November OPEX.

[11\/15 OPEX OI Changes 10\/4-10\/7](https://preview.redd.it/d1hsnr3xgbtd1.png?width=1851&format=png&auto=webp&s=45071113274a3d9c41d0f21c326715b932d856b8)

November OPEX has yet to build out major OI positions yet, not so much on account of DTE, but by that fact that it is a pure monthly, rather than quarterly OPEX (like October). Last week, the only notable expansion of OI came at the $20 strike via our retail whale dropping just under $700k. This is obviously bullish and indicates that this whale is preparing for meaningful upside reversal over the next few weeks. If there is to be upside reversal (which seems a matter of course given our current trend toward our new floor at $20.50-$21) and it is to host some sort of major divergence, then the November OPEX cycle is good frame to set that up. Let me explain:

You may notice that both sneezes (25-28 Jan 2021, 13-15 May 2024) took place in monthly rather than quarterly or yearly OPEX frames. While I am not saying that another Sneeze-type event is definitely coming in November, the October ooga-booga dates fall within the November OPEX monthly frame. I do not say this merely for the purposes of ""look! similar"" but for structural reasons as concern a possible gamma squeeze (an archetypal upward volatility event of which the two Sneezes are examples). 

One of the factors that fueled the Sneezes was a compounding effect feeding call buying behavior from the day's price action \*maxing-out\* the options chain, forcing dealers to add new strikes in order to offset their losses on delivery obligations. When the each of the Sneezes occurred, dealers extended strikes way out overhead of the current price points (all the way out to $125) not only for the nearest expiries, but for all weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly expiries then-extant. This has allowed them to rake in the cash on premiums from retail buyers who view these wayyyy OTM calls as cheap lottery tickets (since for them the whole market is random and unpredictable), while also funneling retail call buying away from near-the-money strikes that exert meaningful upward pressure on MM gamma hedging (ITM buying has the strongest immediate effect, ATM buying is the best bang-for-buck in a gamma squeeze). In May, the $125 calls had a similar effect to the $850 calls bought during the aftershocks of Sneeze 1.0. 

Why does this matter for November OPEX?

November OPEX was not extant as of the May Sneeze. Thus, contract values only go up to $45, not all the way up to $125. \*If\* a major upward volatility event is to occur from swaps expiring or National Cat Day Mania or something similar, it will have a greater chance at drawing in call-buyers to max out the options chain by channeling their capital to call strikes much closer to the money. This explain, at least in part, why the runs approaching September OPEX - especially 9/20 - were as dynamic and high volume as they were (September was also a monthly, rather than quarterly OPEX which lacked calls up to $125) 

Food for thought here, certainly. 

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/azdrrb8hqbtd1.png?width=613&format=png&auto=webp&s=d311bdbee35f1b11f5bb017e9b35d74a2a8a09e5

As we can see here in our composite MM Gamma Exposure by strike, $21 stands out amidst an otherwise gamma net-positive, stable trading range as a major net-negative, downward-volatility promising position. Based on our price action leading up to this point, this downside volatility looks to realize sooner, rather than later, before our price returns to our neutral area around $21.50 (for now). If and when this downside volatility realizes, it will present an strong opportunity for traders and institutions looking to accumulate and build out long call positions into our timeframes farther out (e.g. November, January). 

**Technicals**

[7\/16-9\/19 1-Day Aggregation with Doodle Projection](https://preview.redd.it/p24odrwisbtd1.png?width=1485&format=png&auto=webp&s=496d327229e692277bb4d0168553e1ee3ee46cf6)

With daily volume falling off into the 4.5-5.5mil shares traded range, technicals still basically project the continuation of our neutral-bearish trend down to the area of $20.50-$21. This also continues to conform to the doodle archetype transposed up by $1 (to account for the \~$400mil increased cash value). This last downward run segment may realize sooner or later during the week, but assuming trend continuations and no disruptive externalities, it looks to be our fate this week before the projected recovery thereafter and breakout (likely to the upside) as our current SMA-bracket paradigm expires.

**IV Trends**

https://preview.redd.it/fx4ivou1ubtd1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=0910c76e0520eaa4847a44c2b31cef13934cd57f

With our volume dipping, our 10-Day Mean IV trend has started to dip as well. Although intraday IV values are not quite as low as they were prior to our Q2 earnings run, they have returned to the levels seen just before our September OPEX pop. Institutions may see these next two weeks as a golden opportunity to let IV flatten out and return to something close to that which we saw prior to the T-14 Q2 earnings IV pump in order to build out  heavily IV-depreciated long call positions and maximally profit on late October, early November run. 

**Synthesis¬†+ TA;DR**

Current OI, GEX, and Technical data continue to point to a continued retrace to $20.50-$21 price range before some mild reversal into October OPEX and upside breakout thereafter. If National Cat Day is to correspond this year to an outsize upward volatility event, then the November Monthly OPEX Options framework (though not yet OI) does offer a favorable sandbox in which to build a more dynamic gamma hedge structure than most frameworks since Sneeze 2.0 back in May. We'll have to keep this in mind as we monitor potentially preparatory trader and institutional activity heading into October OPEX.

Good luck out there!

Cheers

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER:¬†These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.

HOW TO STOP? ,"I saw a relevant post about someone picking on their nails and skin, which I also do and plan to go to a dermatologist to see about my rosacea which is a major picking spot for me,

but my WORST and LONGEST picking habit has been chewing on my lips. My lips have always been chapped because I habitually don't drink as much water as I should which is something I'm improving on, 
and I've tried every chapstick on the planet but none of them help my lips heal FAST enough to become smooth again before I find a reason to pick at them.

Most of the time my lips can't even heal fully because I will pick at the scabs that are forming while they try to heal!

It's the texture that irritates my brain and makes it pick up my lips until they are smooth again, whether they are bleeding or not. Anytime that I feel even the slightest texture that I could get a hold of, I start attacking it.

I've been doing this since I was 5 years old and haven't once been able to stop for longer than like 3 days. It really annoys me when I try to put on makeup and I can't put my lipstick on properly because of the amount of wounds that I create and the uneven texture of them healing.

I usually do it subconsciously when I'm stressed out or thinking very hard on something or if I'm bored, I even tried the rubber band snap on your wrist trick and it didn't do anything either. Fidget toys don't work on me because they're not interesting enough to peel me away from chewing on my lips.

What's worse is that I don't often use my hands to do it I usually use my front teeth to pin my lip in between my teeth and work at it incessantly until I bleed.

Has anybody else found a way to stop chewing on their lips successfully? I heard a long time ago that it only takes 21 straight days of doing something to make it a new habit and I figure if I can stop chewing on my lips for 21 days straight maybe I will finally kick it.

Also related: I Vape right now and sometimes use flavored toothpicks but it doesn't seem to help with the oral fixation. I have already quit vaping twice and I plan to quit it a third time once I get out of this stressful few months ahead of me. I'm not a big fan of nicotine because of how it changed me as a person a few years ago when I had been really addicted and it got really bad, so don't worry I plan on quitting soon.

I do NOT chew the inside of my cheeks, and funnily enough I have had TWO tongue piercings in my tongue right now for about 6 years and not once have I ever played or fidgeted with them.

We were together for 5 years, started living together at 20 (with a friend of hers as a roommate). She broke up with me because she wasn't ready to settle down yet and wanted to experience her youth unbound.

Messed with my self confidence, too. Did OK since, another failed serious relationship in the meantime and single for now but it's not like my life has been shit ever since.

  
As mentioned, we didn't stay friends and drifted apart quite fast after breaking up. Every now and then a common friend would mention her or I'd see a post from her on social media in passing but until recently it had been several years since I'd talked to her or seen her IRL. And as the saying goes, out of sight out of mind.

  
She reached out to me just a few weeks ago asking to catch up and I couldn't really see a reason why not, so we did. Had daily chats since and eventually she suggested I drop by her place for a cup of coffee and to talk. We had a nice time and at the end of it she got to the point: She hadn't contacted me solely for some catch-up and chit-chat but because she'd been thinking about me for a while and wanted to give us another try. I told her that I'd need to give that some thought and that's where we left things.

  
On the one hand, why not? A try is just that, she's not (as of now at least) asking us to pick up where we left off nearly a decade ago. And it's been clear from our recent interaction that we're still compatible in many ways, if she was someone I just met I would absolutely be interested in her. It's also not like she did something completely unforgivable like cheating. If anything that's one of the things that sucked the most at the time, couldn't even hate her !

  
But on the other hand she's not someone I just met, far from it. She's someone who once deemed what we had to be insufficient and it's hard not to wonder what changed. Is this a back up plan because X or Y didn't work out for her? Worse perhaps (and not something I *really* suspect), was coming back for me after enjoying her 20s actually plan A? Or is this a case of her outlook (on me, on what she wants, ...) having changed? And putting the ""why"" aside, how would I handle getting dumped by her *again* if that's what how this ultimately ends up?

  
Now, Reddit, I'm not expecting you to solve it for me. Don't really see how I'm going to really make up my mind if not by talking all of this through with her, in depth. The main reason I typed this all out (sorry for rambling, by the way, hope it's coherent still) was to organize my thoughts. I would however be interested in advice that those of you with a similar experience could share.",1,1728305419.0,TrueOffMyChest,10,0.57,False

Tythor asked Jane. S√ºp√∂ had asked Essix to help them: it was easier to just have Jane imagine her perfect work environment and Essix materialize a picture and list all the required items.

""Yes, I think so"" she answered, ""if somethings missing I'll have them inform you"". With that, Tythor made his way to the spaceport, where he hitched a ride with one of the outgoing ships that was heading towards the same system. *Maybe I should buy a second ship* he thought to himself, *it would come in useful in times like this.* Sure, he had a small fleet of delivery vehicles by now. And a sizable amount of warehouses all around the galaxy. But he had never thought about buying a secondary personal ship. *Nah, I don't need it after all. This is working out just fine.* He went to the lounge to meet up with Irene and Vaddemal, who had enjoyed a small vacation in the downtime. They then went to the inspection office.

""I'd really rather not give this thing my seal of approval"" the employee said, ""but due to reasons I cannot and will not disclose, I have to. *Begrudgingly!*"". Tythor thanked the employee and gave a small tip before going back to the ship. It was time to go onto another procurement run.

Some time later, while Tythor was crunching some numbers, the ships alarms started to sound. ""Ze ship is now in a battle configurazion and ready tu fire"" an automated, soft female Terran voice spoke over the PA system in an accent not entirely familiar to Tythor. *Probably from some random component they had around I guess* Tythor thought while rushing to the bridge.

""What's the status?"" he asked.

""We're being hailed. Transponder matches the *Interstellar Revenue Service*. A Terran tax collection organization according to our databases?"" Irene answered.

""Put them through. I wish to insult them to their faces"" Tythor commanded, tingling with anticipation. There was simply no way he'd part with his hard earned credits only that the Terran government could spend it all on something ludicrous. ""What do I owe the displeasure to?"" he asked innocently as a Terran appeared on screen.

""We're from the Interstellar Revenue Service. It has come to our attention that, despite conducting business in the Sol system, you haven't payed any taxes on your proceedings since your companies inception"" the obviously hostile officer explained, ""we have orders to take you in and impound your ship until said dues are payed"".

""I'm not even Terran"" Tythor responded, ""so why should I?""

""Because you are conducting business in the Sol system. All business conducted in the Sol system is due to tariffs and taxes. Furthermore, for all intents and purposes you *are* considered a citizen of Terra, and thus subject to Terran tax laws"" the officer answered.

""Hmmm...according to my data here, you're only *one* of *multiple* organizations that operates for this specific purpose in Terran space "" Tythor discerned, "" if I were to pay what you request to each single organization in your system, I'd be bankrupt in about...two hours. I think I'll pass!"".

""Should you fail to pay your dues in time, we *will* put a bounty on your head. We're here to collect, by force if necessary"" Tythors counterpart elaborated, ""so it would be best if you'd just complied"".

""Before I do that, I'd like to know why you call yourself a *Service*? In my understanding, a service is a simple transaction: I pay somebody and they provide me with something, be it material or immaterial. Yet, I don't see any obvious benefit to paying you at all. I don't even know how much I owe you?"" Tythor started to become irritated.

""The service we provide is *collecting your taxes*"" the officer responded, ""the benefit is that we will not lock you up in prison. And it's *your* duty to do your taxes, not ours"".

""So you are racketeers?"" Tythor inquired bluntly, ""Pirates? I pay you to leave me alone?""

""No, we're a legally sanctioned..."" the officer spoke a long text about why their protection racket was supposed to be legal, that it was sanctioned by the Terran government and that if Tythor wished to continue business in Terran space he'd have to pay up.

Vaddemal meanwhile had been busy targeting the enemy ship. ""Cannons be ready Captain. Standing by for order"".

""No, no. Stand down. Mr. Officer, could I have your name?"" Tythor asked innocently. The officer complied. ""That's a stupid name. Anyways, I won't be paying you jack shit. What I'll do instead is simply not provide Terran space with *my services*. And I'll broadcast this conversation all over Terra. Good day to you too, you damn pirates!""

Irene had been checking the engines, then plotting a course *far away from the enemy ship*. As soon as Tythor was done talking she started up the engines. The enemy ship started firing at them.

""Now that's just plain rude"" Vaddemal exclaimed, ""permission to fire back?""

""*Granted.* Aim for their engines. We don't want to kill them, just cripple them so they have no choice but to leave us alone"" Tythor commanded. Then he made a recording:

""My dear loyal customers. Effective immediately, Tythors Interstellar Trading and Translocation Emporium will cease operations in Terran space. This includes the Sol system, as well as the systems you can see listed on the screen. The reason for our departure from Terran space is the ongoing scourge of government sanctioned pirate organizations, such as the *Interstellar Revenue Service, Magpie* and similar. The following recording will serve as an example of what we have to deal with when providing our services to Terran space.

I wish you all the best in your endeavors, as well as the best of luck trying to find a suitable replacement for your everyday shopping needs. Should you wish to continue business with us, we *are* going to open a new outlet *just outside of Terran space* for your convenience\*.\* Any Terran pirate fleet trying to extort us, be it government aligned or not, *will be shot at with the greatest prejudice!"".*

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*

""By the divine, you got to see this"" Rakke yelled while running to S√ºp√∂, ""Terra put a bounty on Tythor!"".

""On Tythor? Are you trying to make fun of me?"" S√ºp√∂ responded incredulous.

""I ain't! Look it up on the Terran most wanted site!"" Rakke answered.

""And why would they do that?"" S√ºp√∂ asked slightly concerned. Maybe the damn Rakhar had gotten himself into trouble.

""It says here ... *Tax evasion* and w*ar declaration?*"" Rakke was slightly confused. The first part made sense, the second didn't. He searched the available networks for more information on this breaking development.

*\_\_\_\_\_\_\_*

**Tythor declared fugitive in Sol and Sol-aligned systems**

Our favorite Rakhar, captain of *The Man* and champion of the common folk due to low prices and quick deliveries has been declared a fugitive in Sol and all Sol-aligned systems. Tax evasion has been given as the reason. Tythor indicted himself when broadcasting a conversation he had recorded with a ship from the Interstellar Revenue Service. Our investigations revealed that the only reason why Tythor was able to operate within the borders of these systems was because he's a Rakhar, and everybody just assumed that a Rakhar would do everything by the book. His intention to, and we quote, ""*build a shopping outlet just outside the border of Terran space and to shoot, with the greatest prejudice, at any Terran racketeering vessel that dares to fly too close to said outlet*"" has been interpreted as a war declaration by the Nation of United Terran States. We expect our dear friend to find refuge in an independent system for the time being. The stock market has tanked as a result of this news.

""This is some freaking BS! How the f\*\*\* am I supposed to do my duty now?"" a Terran solider who wished to remain anonymous asked during our interview. Other responses were ""If I find the damn idiot responsible for this, I'll tear them a new one"" and ""I hope the responsible person disappears into a black hole"". Tythor commented that he's *already reluctantly paying his dues to the galactic senate* and the demands of the Terran government are ""*extortionist and unreasonable*"". Some people speculate that this was an operation conducted by a collective of Terran conglomerates, whose profits had been significantly lower during the time that Tythor operated in our systems. He and the convenience his chain brought upon us will be sorely missed.

Tythors new outlet store at the border to Terran space is projected to be operational within a week. Should your tax returns be late this season, it's because Tythor also supplied the very same agencies that have now caused him to be considered a fugitive. We'll keep you updated.

Am I a jerk for wanting to take a step back from him ? Because I am not able to talk to him now with out snap . ,"Im in my 20s and I currently live with my parents (I am a student ) and the last few years I am very lonely .
I lost most of my friends and I don't go out anymore (once in a while with a friend for a coffee it can be even once a 3 months ) . 
My parents really judgemental to me they always see me as a liar , insecure and someone you can't trust on  and it effects me very much . More than that I used to be bullied since I was a BABY(yes)  on my looks . 

Anyway , my brother kinda know what I am facing with ,and I just notice that he talks to me odd like I am different and not in a good way , he speaks to me like I talk to my 6 yo niece . I just realized it yesterday how he actually sees me as someone who need a special attention. 

I went to visit him and his wife at the hospital to congrats him for having a baby , and when I came all exited hug him and congrat him he looked at me like and told my parents ""aww look at her how sweet she is congrats me "" with a tone like he talks to a little child, and it just kept going in other situations and I was kinda off because of it  the whole evening, because I got tired from it so I felt uncomfortable and wanted to leave ASAP but I couldn't because I came with my parents so I didn't have how to return (he lives far) . 

After few minutes her cousins  came to visit and I just went for a second to take my phone and my brother was behind me and he forced me to come back and said ""hey come in where are you going"" like I am running away from something and I just couldn't stand the way he talks to me like something is wrong with me all the fuckin time ! 
Anyway i sat and just felt really bad  uncomfortable and mad because I felt like I am being treated differently. my brother was next to me and put his hand on my shoulder like he support me or whatever. 
I felt like I am about to snap and get out , I couldn't be around him anymore I just sick from the fact that he talks above me and treat me like I have a problem all the time because I used to share my feelings with him and my social condition now ( that I am lonely) 

Today he called me and  asked me out of no where ""why were you so off yesterday when the family of his wife got in were you shyy from them ? That's whyyy?""

I felt like I couldn't handle it anymore and I am about to snap any second  so I got quite for a second on the phone and said ""omg seriously you called me for asking me if am i shy from her family ?wth ? I said I was TIRED "" And just told me I need to go and then he said ""but talk to me yes ? Okay ? "" And I just said okay I got to hang up now bye . 

He knows I am dealing with a lot of things right now, I am very lonely and not able to be social because for so long I was lonely that I think I lost my skills somehow .. 
so I see him always tests me around people and it makes me feel bad with my self because I know he judge me and label me as someone insecure who have no one, so I also do feels like it when I am around him . 
I can notice it and it bothers me so much that he reminds me of it everytime he is around and makes me feel like I need some special treat like I am not normal, I mean I do appreciate him a lot and respect him but it's just way too much , it never stops , the way he looks at me and talks to me like I am different in a bad way.. 

Later I just was so mad and sad at the same time I almost breaked down and was about to cry because I realized I have nobody that can see me as equal and not like an outsider .

 he called me twice on my way home and I didn't answer him because I knew the moment I'll hear him I'll just start to say things I'll regret for saying . 

Now I want to take a step back from him at least for a few weeks (well actually I already did) , I know he loves me and I do love him but I am sick of his behave towardss me .

I live in Florida and my area is just recovering from Helene; meanwhile, we have massive hurricane Milton projected to make a direct hit, not even 10 days later. While my home was structurally safe during Helene, we lost power for 4 days, sewage for 2, I had covid, so we couldn't go stay with anyone, and all hotels were sold out. I was boiling in my sleep, and hardly slept, if that... taking calls and trying to stay ""engaged"" from the car (I'm a consultant, so very high stress fast paced work that is hard to do in a car), and then working from random coffee shops and hole in the wall restaurants the days after our power was restored, because Wifi was out. All of this stress compounded by the worry that my dog was suffering in the heat, we had no place to go, I wasn't feeling well... etc. We returned to our apartment to find some of our valuable electronics fried in a power surge, and had to throw away the entire contents of our fridge and freezer, of course.



Now, with this other storm that is supposed to be far worse, it's rinse and repeat. We evacuated this time, which ended up being a 6 hour drive in horizontal downpour yesterday. All of this has left me feeling very exhausted and out of sorts, however, I feel as if I'm being overdramatic sharing this with my team, since I haven't suffered any grave tragedy such as losing my entire home. My team is from up north and doesn't really understand the gravity of the situation, I'm afraid. I'm just exhausted and need a few days off to recover after all is said and done, but don't feel justified in asking for it.

1fy6lzg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1fy6lzg/my_husband_always_critique_the_things_i_saydo/,My husband always critique the things I say/do.,"We‚Äôve been going to church to for two years now. My husband has been going to church since he was a kid but then stopped in his early 20‚Äôs. He goes through phases where he read into the Bible everyday (a month or two) and then stops for a while then gets deep into again. Whenever he puts time into reading the Bible, he gets very critical of the things I say and do. Whenever he stops reading for weeks or months, he doesn‚Äôt do that. 

Right now he‚Äôs been watching videos and sermons that Jesus is coming any day and maybe this year so he‚Äôs been reading the Bible everyday. 

Sometimes when I‚Äôm scrolling on tiktok, he‚Äôll say things like maybe I should put more time into reading the Bible than on tiktok. I feel he doesn‚Äôt see that he‚Äôs able to read the Bible all day because I‚Äôm taking care of the kids and the house. While when I try to read the Bible, I have to pause every other minute to tend our kids.

The other day we were talking before praying at night, he asked if there‚Äôs anything I want to pray about. I thought about it and said no. He continued to say ‚ÄúNothing? Nothing at all? Not even anyone or your sister? Do you just not have any care in the world?‚Äù 

The other day we got into a bit of a debate. He was talking about whenever he come across people he always test their spirit to see if they genuinely believe in God or if they‚Äôre just saying it. I told him that I don‚Äôt that‚Äôs right because he doesn‚Äôt know them and he can‚Äôt assume their faith in a 3 minute conversation. He says that I‚Äôm wrong for judging him. I told him that it‚Äôs wrong for him to go to random people and test their spirit. Then he started saying that he has every right to ask them about their testimony or what does Jesus mean to them.

Another example is the way he talks about God with our son. The other day our son came to him with a picture he drew about Pok√©mon. My husband told him to stop focusing on Pok√©mon and think more about God and Jesus. Sometimes he would ask our son a question regarding God and if he can‚Äôt answer my husband would say things like that‚Äôs why he needs to think about God and Jesus all the time. Sometimes our son gets frustrated and starts crying in which I step in and tell him to stop. He‚Äôs only 6. He‚Äôs still too young to grasp it all. But he doesn‚Äôt care and does it any way.


Today I was telling about how my class went (I‚Äôm a Sunday school teacher for toddlers). I was talking our daughter saying ‚ÄúLike damn, she just wouldn‚Äôt listen to me in class.‚Äù And then he says ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say Damn. Don‚Äôt damn her.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt damning her, I was expressing my frustration.

And then later he was going through his contacts and he laughed and said he still has his step dad‚Äôs phone number. His step dad and mom divorced. He was abusive, druggie, and constantly cheated on his mom. And I joked saying ‚ÄúHey you should call him and say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up Bobby?‚Äù and then he got serious and say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny. You‚Äôd shouldn‚Äôt be saying that. You know he had a stroke right?‚Äù

Just a few days ago, our pediatrician told us that our son has tics. It‚Äôs been going on for 2 years now. She said we need to inform ourselves on how to help him and accept it. It usually gets worse if he‚Äôs in an anxious environment My husband he breaks things from time to time when he gets angry. He also takes everything I say as me starting an argument. Our son went through a lot and sometimes he comes to me and say we need calm down and stop. Which my husband doesn‚Äôt stop. With those scenarios, I told my husband that we really need to work on being patient with each other and with him. We really need to control our emotions and stop arguing in front of him. I told him that when it first started I told him to really get it together but now he really needs to do it because it‚Äôs affecting him. My husband said he will and I said that he‚Äôs been saying that for 5 years now and I hope this time he really mean it. Then he got mad at me and said I‚Äôm trying to entice him and then started yelling at me. He said I was trying start problems with him as usual. And then our son asked if we can stop. Then I turned to my husband and asked ‚ÄúDo you not see my point?‚Äù He said no because I‚Äôm purposely enticing him and how I preach for him to be patient yet I won‚Äôt allow him to be.

Once he got me a bottle of coffee, I was thirsty and drank it. Then he says that I should always pray before I drink or eat anything. Even if it‚Äôs water or a snack. I suddenly felt bad. Then he quote a verse from the Bible. Whether it‚Äôs me or our kids, if we eat or drink without praying, he would say something about it. 

But then whenever he goes through times where he‚Äôs not deep into the word of God, he spends his time playing games and drinking. He doesn‚Äôt get critical about everything I say or do. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for but is it wrong of me to say he‚Äôs doing too much? He loves God so much and he commits his time.

I struggled with my weight since I was in my mid to late teens.  I have a lot of overweight family so I never noticed I was heavy until of course other people pointed it out.  

My lowest weight was 132lbs, highest was 230lbs.  

ATM I am a 44f, 5'8 180.5lbs  

I have probably gained and lost over 1,000 pounds I kid you not.  Now when covid hit, and I was at my lowest I basically said F\*ck it and gave myself this free for all  like if I die tomorrow no one going to look at me in my casket and be like wow she looks amazing.  Weekend drinking turned to daily drinking, now this isn't getting drunk daily but having a drink daily.  In a year I gained to about 210lbs,  I have been dieting (I have followed low carb for most of my adult life and its how I FEEL best eating)   and now I'm stuck.  I have been hovering around the same weight for over a year.  I would even get to 179.9 then like cough to hard and be 180 again lmao.  

PRE covid, I was exercising daily, always made sure to get in 10k-20k steps a day (I have a peddle machine under my desk and I work from home so I'm always using it even now as I type this lol)  Besides that I do a form of exercise called callanetics that I love and see results VERY VERY quickly which always kept me motived. 

This fell off and I have not been regularly active again up until the last 2 months, I now wake up 5am take some pre energy drink, and do my callanetics and treadmill work before starting my job from home.  NOW while i have seen my body changing and I feel better the scale doesn't budge.  I gain and lose the same couple of pounds.  

ANYWAY here I am, I started on Tuesday last week so almost a week in.  I am down some pounds, the food noise (never understood what this was before now)  is gone.  I have to remember to eat.   

I am 1000% a caffeine junky and love my daily drinks of tequila.  I noticed a few times this passed week that i forgot to do my pre-workout  in the morning with working out, and there are days I only had one cup of coffee (normally I do at least one cup with a shot of espresso)  NOT ONLY THAT But in this passed week I only had one drink, and it was because I thought I needed or like deserved it (had to have a pet put to sleep) and I ended up nursing it so long that I didn't even get warm and fuzzy from it lol.  This is the longest I went with out drinking since pre covid.  This is absolutely amazing to me, oh and I forgot to take my pre workout again today lol.  

Even if this does not end up being the help for weight loss that I hope for it to be  (along with exercise and high protein, medium to low fat, and low carb eating)  with calorie restriction.  My liver and anxiety are already thanking this drug.  ",4,1728304504.0,Semaglutide,1,1.0,False

This type of plaque is not just a cosmetic concern but also a potential indicator of oral hygiene issues. Unlike the more common yellow or brown plaque, which results from a mix of food particles, bacteria, and saliva, orange plaque often signals specific bacterial colonies that are interacting differently with the substances in one's diet or saliva.

# Types of tooth discoloration

Tooth discoloration can occur for various reasons and result in a wide range of colors. These changes in color can be caused by both internal and external factors. Here's a breakdown of the different types of tooth discoloration:

1. **Extrinsic Discoloration:** This occurs when the outer layer of the tooth (the enamel) is stained. Common causes include:
   * **Food and Drinks:** Coffee, tea, red wine, and some fruits and vegetables (like apples and potatoes) can stain teeth.
   * **Smoking and Tobacco Use:** Tar and nicotine in tobacco can create stubborn stains on the surface of teeth.
   * **Poor Dental Hygiene:** Inadequate brushing and flossing to remove plaque and stain-producing substances can lead to discoloration.
2. **Intrinsic Discoloration:** This type of discoloration occurs within the tooth, affecting the dentin (the layer beneath the enamel). Causes include:
   * **Aging:** Over time, the enamel can thin, and the dentin naturally yellows.
   * **Exposure to Minerals (like fluoride) in Excess:** Excessive fluoride exposure, especially in children, can cause fluorosis, which appears as white spots or lines on the teeth.
   * **Tetracycline Antibiotics:** If taken during tooth formation, these antibiotics can cause discoloration.
   * **Trauma:** Damage from a fall can disturb enamel formation in young children or cause discoloration in adults.
3. **Age-Related Discoloration:** This is a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The dentin naturally yellows over time, and the enamel covering the teeth gets thinner with age, allowing the dentin to show through.

Understanding these types can help in addressing the specific causes of tooth discoloration and choosing appropriate treatment methods, such as professional cleaning, bleaching, or covering the discoloration with veneers or crowns.

# What factors cause orange plaque on teeth?

Several factors can lead to the formation of orange plaque on teeth, primarily related to oral hygiene and lifestyle choices. Here are the key contributors:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Chromogenic Bacteria:** These are specific types of bacteria that produce pigments, causing discoloration on the teeth. They thrive in environments where oral hygiene is poor.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Dietary Habits:** Consuming foods and beverages with strong colorants, such as certain candies, sodas, and sports drinks, can promote the growth of these bacteria and the resulting discoloration.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Poor Oral Hygiene:** Inadequate brushing and flossing facilitate the buildup of plaque and tartar on the teeth, which can lead to discoloration. Regular oral hygiene practices are essential to remove these deposits and prevent the development of colored plaque.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Infrequent Dental Visits:** Skipping regular dental check-ups and cleanings can allow plaque and tartar to accumulate on the teeth, which may contribute to the formation of orange plaque over time.

Addressing these factors through improved dental care routines and lifestyle adjustments can help prevent the formation of orange plaque and maintain overall oral health.

# How to Identify Orange Plaque on Teeth

Identifying orange plaque on teeth involves noticing unusual coloration on the dental surfaces. Here‚Äôs how to spot it:

1. **Visual Inspection:** Orange plaque is typically visible as a distinct orange or reddish-orange film on the teeth. It‚Äôs more commonly found near the gum line but can appear anywhere on the tooth surface.
2. **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Dentists can identify orange plaque during routine examinations using professional dental tools and lighting.
3. **Dental Imaging:** Although not typically necessary for plaque identification, imaging techniques can help in assessing overall oral health and the extent of any plaque buildup.

# How to Prevent Orange Plaque on Teeth

Preventing the formation of [orange plaque](https://avaldent.com/orange-plaque-on-the-teeth/) involves a combination of good oral hygiene practices and dietary modifications. Here are effective strategies:

1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:**

   * **Brushing:** Brush at least twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, ensuring to brush all surfaces of your teeth thoroughly.
   * **Flossing:** Floss at least once a day to remove food particles and plaque from between the teeth and under the gum line.
   * **Mouthwash:** Use an antiseptic mouthwash to help reduce bacteria that cause plaque and gum disease.

2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Regular Dental Visits:** Schedule dental check-ups and cleanings every six months or as recommended by your dentist to remove tartar and plaque that can‚Äôt be eliminated by brushing and flossing alone.

3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Dietary Adjustments:**

   * **Reduce Intake of Sugary and Starchy Foods:** These can feed the bacteria in your mouth, increasing the risk of plaque formation.
   * **Avoid Foods with High Pigmentation:** Limit consumption of heavily colored foods and beverages that can stain your teeth and contribute to plaque buildup.

4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Quit Smoking:** If you smoke, consider quitting. Smoking is a significant risk factor for many dental problems, including the formation of plaque and tartar.

5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Hydration:** Drinking plenty of water helps wash away food particles and bacteria in the mouth, reducing the risk of plaque.

By following these preventive measures, you can significantly reduce the likelihood of developing orange plaque and maintain better overall dental health.

# Complications and Risks of Orange Plaque Formation on Teeth

The formation of orange plaque on teeth isn't just a cosmetic issue; it can lead to several dental health complications if not addressed properly:

1. **Gum Disease:** Orange plaque can irritate the gums, leading to gingivitis, characterized by red, swollen, and bleeding gums. If left untreated, it can progress to more severe periodontal diseases.
2. **Tooth Decay:** Plaque harbors bacteria that produce acids from sugar in the diet. These acids can erode the tooth enamel, leading to cavities and tooth decay.
3. **Bad Breath (Halitosis):** The bacteria in plaque can produce odors, resulting in persistent bad breath, which can be socially embarrassing and indicative of poor oral health.
4. **Tooth Loss:** In severe cases, the ongoing presence of plaque and the resulting periodontal disease can weaken the supporting structures of the teeth, potentially leading to tooth loss.

# Treatment Methods for Orange Plaque on Teeth

Treating orange plaque involves both professional dental care and home oral hygiene practices:

1. **Professional Cleaning:** Regular professional teeth cleaning (dental prophylaxis) by a dentist or dental hygienist is crucial. This procedure helps remove plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) that can't be removed with brushing and flossing alone.
2. **Improved Oral Hygiene Practices:**
   * **Brushing:** Use a soft-bristled toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste to brush your teeth at least twice a day. Consider using an electric toothbrush for more effective cleaning.
   * **Flossing:** Floss daily to remove plaque from between the teeth and under the gum line where the toothbrush can't reach.
   * **Mouthwash:** Use an antibacterial mouthwash to help reduce plaque and eliminate bacteria that cause bad breath.
3. **Dietary Modifications:** Limit sugary and acidic foods and drinks that can promote plaque formation and tooth decay. Eating a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products can help protect and strengthen teeth.
4. **Regular Dental Check-Ups:** Visit your dentist regularly for examinations and professional cleanings. Your dentist can provide advice tailored to your specific dental needs.

By addressing orange plaque promptly and effectively, you can prevent its associated risks and maintain a healthy, vibrant smile.

# Faq

**Why should dental plaque be removed?**

¬†Dental plaque should be removed because it harbors bacteria that produce acids after consuming sugar from your diet. These acids can lead to tooth decay, gum disease, and other oral health issues. Regular removal of plaque prevents the buildup of tartar, which is hardened plaque that can only be removed by professional dental tools.

**How can plaque affect oral health?**

Plaque contributes to several oral health problems:

* **Tooth Decay:** The acids produced by plaque bacteria erode tooth enamel, leading to cavities.
* **Gum Disease:** Plaque buildup along the gum line can cause inflammation and infection of the gums, known as gingivitis, which can progress to more severe periodontal disease if untreated.
* **Bad Breath:** Plaque and the associated bacteria can cause halitosis (bad breath), affecting personal and social interactions.

**Where does orange plaque typically form in the mouth?**

¬†Orange plaque most commonly forms near the gum line and between the teeth, where bacteria are more likely to accumulate due to less disruption from regular brushing. However, it can appear on any tooth surface that is frequently exposed to chromogenic bacteria and certain dietary elements.

**How long do teeth stay stain-free after treatment?**

The duration that teeth remain stain-free after treatment depends on individual oral hygiene practices and lifestyle choices. With good oral hygiene (regular brushing and flossing) and avoidance of stain-causing foods and drinks, teeth can stay clean and free from new stains for a long time. Regular dental check-ups and cleanings also help in maintaining a stain-free appearance.

**What causes a child's teeth to turn orange?**

A child's teeth may turn orange primarily due to poor oral hygiene or the consumption of foods and beverages that stain, such as certain fruit juices or candy. In children, the presence of chromogenic bacteria, which thrive in less-cleaned mouths, can also lead to orange plaque formation. It's important to establish good brushing habits early to prevent such discoloration and ensure overall dental health.

1fy6e4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1fy6e4v/my_ex_feels_lonely_and_i_blame_it_on_his_friend/,My ex feels lonely and I blame it on his friend group.,"I met my(F34) ex(M28) at ""work"". I say work because its a special company ran by health insurance in my country. I dont want to get into much detail there. 
 After working together I developed feelings for him. One day when we were alone during break, I told him how I felt and if it was ok for him to friendzone me. He told me he had a similar experience with a ""coworker"" where he asked to be friendzoned, but nothing happened between them. This was a stupid thing to say, I know, but I thought I didnt have any chance with the guy, which he replied to: who said you arent my type? Kinda thing.He also revealed to me to be a virgin and lacking experience with women. One day we agreed to meet at his place where he was supposed to help with stuff from work but ended up sleeping together.
 So after that we kept meeting until one month after we decided to make it official girlfriend and boyfriend. 
 When he's at home, he games with friends online and sometimes even meet in person for drinks or whatever. 
I remembered what he said, about asking someone to friendzone him. He changed the story a bit, claiming the ""coworker"" was one of his friends. One girl he games with. This girl is one of the ""bros"", you know what I mean...
 So it turns out he had a crush on this girl and that happened. he threw the hint that he liked her but got friendzoned instead. To make things worse, he told me she was queer and only dated girls. Of course I immediately calmed down and accepted that. 
 Time passed by, the group would game almost every day. I pushed for more info, and here comes the lie, she is not indeed queer, shes very much into d*cks. Why would my ex lie to me? Who knows.
 The relationship was mostly good except when this gamer girl friend came as a topic, we would always argue. 

Here is where most of you will think im controlling. 
They would always go to the gym together, saying it helped as motivation to even go there, they would text each other asking to go etc.

Every time we'd argue and give each other ""time""(yes, mroe like a break up but none of us could keep it and ended up together after few weeks), he'd always go running to this girl friend of his and spending time with her and making plans. He lied to me in the past, months after our relationship started saying he'd go to a music festival with his bros, but never mentioned her. Well ladies guess what, she did go with him, he even hid pictures of them together on his phone. I asked him to unlock his hidden folder which he did and there they were. I told him: if nothing is happening between you two, why hide the pictures? Or even lie to me? Arent you friends and nothing else?? He agreed with me and said it was stupid and didnt know why he hid them. Keep in mind he was virgin before meeting me and I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
 We lasted one year together,having arguments about this friend and how I was trying to sto him from seeing his friends. My problem was never his bros, more like this one single chick. He made me believe he had other female friends he'd talk to but later I found out he doesnt even game with them or anything. 
 One day at his place it got so bad, I tried to tell him, ok, lets talk together directly, from his friendlist on his computer. He unplugged the PC immediately and screamed at me to leave. He ended up kicking me out.
 
At this point I dont know what the fuck to believe. He gets super defensive when I asked him to talk to her or even introduce me to his friend group (which he hasnt voluntarily). 

At the end, he broke up with me definitely, saying we didnt share the same goals in life and he didnt see a future with me together, etc. No reason of me being a bit on the heavier side of the scale while he has this hot chick friend, right?? So yeah, he can break up for whatever reason, if he wasnt happy with me he has the right to end the relationship.

At this point we broke up so much during the relationship that I couldnt find the tears anymore and let him go.
 Right as he was about to block me, told the truth of to how many events he has been with this chick when he said he wasnt going with her.

After months of going no contact, I saw his birthday was getting closer and wanted to send him a birthday card, like the one he sent me. Maybe I jsut wanted to hear from him again, and at the same time didnt feel like owing him anything.
 I didnt remember his address and emailed him saying, this is not an emergency, I just forgot your address and would like to send you a birthday card, he didnt have to reply to me if he didnt want the card.
Hours later he replied with his address.

I noticed he unblocked me from Twitch, the streaming website for gamers and wished him again, a happy birthday. And he didnt block me back after that day, in fact, we kept chatting and like an idiot I invited him for a coffee.
Im embarrassed to admit that he spent the night at my place. 
 While searching something on his phone, I took it and opened his browser apps, just curious to see if he was watching p*rn. I know, stupid, dont ask! Hes not the kind of defensive idiot who would take his phone out of my hands unless hes very angry. But I know he deletes ""evidence"" aka messages so he didnt bother when I took it. I saw a tab open for a dating website. I was surprised, but also happy for him that he tried to go back out there ins earch for love. He said he went to his chick friend (running to her AGAIN) and told her he was feeling lonely lately and thats when she suggested that dating website. Again, throwing hints at her but she couldnt care less.
 More came out of that evening. Said he found himself drinking mroe and more lately, that he'd go depressed without alcohol. He told me this chick friend dated one of the guys in the group and ""didn't end well"" for them, but they are still part of the group. 

Days later, we still talking, and tells me he was gonna invite people over for drinks. I suggested going to a bar nobody had visited yet. Days go by and looks like nobody wanted to go to the bar and he ended u hosting a party, which you know who went there. This chick and the bois. The guy she dated didnt show up, shocker.

Initially my ex told me, only one of the bois who would go to his place with the car would spend the night there.
Next morning, I put pressure again and tells me the chick and another person stayed there. I was furious.

 I called him that afternoon after everyone had left. I even started to cry because I felt bad for him. I told him he cant have the cake and eat it too. He cant complain of being lonely when this chick is cockblocking him and hes letting her do so. None of his friends has a partner, they are all single. This woman has a body count of over 30 and even sleeps with his friends. All except for my ex. He insist they are only friends and isnt attracted to her (anymore I assume?? He had feelings for her at some point in life).
 I told him, if hes happy with drinking everyday to fill the void, to game with their friends until 1 AM every day, then thats okay! But he had no reason to complain about loneliness. No woman likes the relationship he has with his friends and if he ever finds one whos ok with it, he should marry her right away. 

I said a lot of things, he was mostly quiet. He said he was coming over.


It ended in him coming over, me chewing him up again, at some point he wanted to leave but decided not to. He left the next day and blocked me everywhere. He was very sad I'd tell. But Im fed up. His priority in life is not his partner, its his friends. They are almost like a damn cult. I am not used of friendship being this close, it makes me uncomfortable. If he asked me to get back together I'd say yes but with the condition he ditches that 1 ""friend"". 

We both lack experience. I dont know what friendship is like and he doesnt know what a relationship is. I am aware im very jealous and possesive and Id rather have him 24/7. I wouldnt mind if he had nights out with the bois, but the idea of other women being there annoys me. He, isolated me from his friendgroup and never introduced me to his family even after being official. 

This is not an AITAH post. But would like some advice from you. How do you view friendship in general? Is it normal to spend so much time with friends like this? I asked my friend about it, because I dont see her hanging out with friends everyday, in fact, she barely does. I visit her once every two weeks maybe.

TLDR: talked to my ex after the breakup for his birthday. He feels lonely, drinks almost daily but also doesnt want to change his friendsgroup dynamic of gaming every night. This one girl in the group is the reason nobody dates him. And if anyone tells him hes doing it to himself he gets defensive and says hes got the right to be with his friends all he wants.",0,1728304096.0,TwoXChromosomes,5,0.5,False

Me and my siblings were all born and raised in the church in Europe, where the official percentage of members is a whopping 0.5 %.

My sister left 19 years ago age 21, and did a complete ""180"", wanting to catch up on everything she missed out during her teenage years. Homemade Tattoos, Alcohol, Nicotine, street drugs, Men, etc

I left only 8 months ago age 40, and my life has barely changed. I didn't even drink a coffee for 2 months after leaving and alcohol until 4 months after I left. The only thing I quickly ticked off my box was having Sex- which I did 11 days after leaving- being single, not being able to enjoy physical intimacy for so many years was pure torture for me.  


Now I drink alcohol maybe 3 times a month, I have zero interest in street drugs, no ""hoe phase""-I had sex with only two different guys since I left.

I don't know how much of this is the real me, and how much of this is the conditioning of the so called church?

But I am curious about all of you- how much did you change your habits after leaving? Or did you not change them at all? Are you curious about trying out everything, or are you not really interested?

1fy68gu,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1fy68gu/please_keep_in_mind_your_diagnosis_wont_change/,"Please keep in mind, your diagnosis won't change how people see you","Most people don't care about your diagnosis and it won't change how they think of you. I just had a couple of rough interactions at work (where I'm only out in order to recieve accommodations) where some NT people reminded me my paperwork, my goverment issued disability ID, didn't change how people saw me. To be specific, it's that I struggle with eye contact and ""make visitors to the department nervous"" and struggle with face-blindness (which no one seems to want to understand no matter how many times I explain how it works)

But I've had plenty of similar experiences with other symptoms before. I'm AuDHD with dyspraxia, dyslexia and dysgraphia diagnoses (got them at different times in my life maybe I would have just gotten dyspraxia rather than both that and dysgraphia, not sure if it's usual to get both)

People used to and still do get upset at me for so many tiny things. I'm clumsy, a messy eater and cook, I struggle to process information quickly and read accurately, my writing has gotten better but even with therapy I'm still dysgraphic and dyspraxic. I struggle to move quickly and accurately especially under stress and also struggle to hear what people are saying even though my ears actually work just fine. Honestly stress just makes me not function at all.


I'm not trying to write a sob-story, those are just symptoms that people have gotten upset at me for.

People have told me I shouldn't drink coffee cause I'll spill it, I shouldn't wear nail-polish cause it's too messy, should ""just buy a car"" if public transport is too overwhelming and ""just bike to work"" if driving is too stressfull

Now that I've been diagnosed I try to tell people that I have a disability if I feel like it'll impact our interaction, or if something related to my disabilities happens etc. People honestly don't care. 

The polite ones will often complain less. Rude people either ignore it, or tell me to just try harder and that people without arms and legs learn to work and people with palsy have learned to powerlift and my willpower is what's holding me back. Honestly I prefer the rude people, cause they'll at least open about how they'll treat me. Polite people often just slowly ghost me cause they know they'd be rude telling me the truth but they don't want to ""put up with me"" so they pretend they're being nice and just leave

What I'm trying to say is that most likely, if they got mad at you for showing symptoms before diagnosis they'll still get mad at you afterwards too, they just won't be as open about it and might ghost you because of it.

I'm also not doomer posting, I just want people seeking a diagnosis to know that it won't solve that problem. These experiences validated my being content being for myself and a tiny group of people close to me. I'm not a friendless looser I'm content and happy being alone with my partner (and I do have a couple of friends, almost all ND but still) I don't want anything to do with people who act like this and I don't have to please them, I will never be capable of masking pefectly and people-pleasing them into being decent people",4,1728303597.0,autism,1,1.0,False

I really tried to challenge myself with this one, using a lot of strong colors and patterns. My flips are usually more neutral but this was a fun one to do. I decided not to worry to much about the budget, experimented back and forth with wallpapers and paint colors and went a bit nuts with the clutter. I've never flipped a house this big before either so it took some time to do. 

I wanted to try to keep some of the overgrown look outside and at the same time bring a bit of nature indoors.

I'm happy with it but looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

When it arrived, the bag was open and the foil was missing. I figured the shop had ran out but since the bag was also open, I called to check. The shop said they hadn't ran out and forgetting the foil is as likely as forgetting the drink.

For context, I've ordered from the shop about three times a week for over a year. The bag's never been open and the foil never missing.

Emailed just eat. No acknowledgement.

Does anyone have a recommendation on a non-oily bean that is usually sold at Costco.

I assume the Kirkland brand is just like Starbucks, which are all oily.

The William coffee is pretty good, but it too is oily as well.

So I pull up to the window and the girl says, ""two bagels and a coffee, right?""

""Nope...two donuts and a milk.""

She stared at me...totally confused...she looked at her register, then back at me...then asks, ""Are you sure?""

""Yep...two donuts and a milk.""

Same confused look...then the kicker...she says, ""oh...well what did the car behind you order?""

I asked her to leave and it all turned very sour, but she‚Äôs now gone. 

I went to drop off some things she left at the house and was greeted by her boyfriend and a couple of his friends to intimidate and threaten me unless I give her the full deposit back immediately. The usual pay it back or we know where you live stuff. 

For a little context her deposit was only ¬£400 but she‚Äôs ~¬£200 behind on rent, she broke my oven, coffee machine, microwave etc and also ruined the paint in her bedroom and has left many stains on the carpet. 

I‚Äôm in the process of changing my locks and getting a security camera installed. My partner thinks I should pay back the full deposit and just take it on the chin, but I don‚Äôt think I should give in to bullies. 

I think it‚Äôs mostly empty threats but what‚Äôre people‚Äôs experiences? I know I‚Äôm safe if they tried to take me to court as I‚Äôve got a contract, messages, photos and I‚Äôve done everything by the book. ",3,1728303030.0,HousingUK,8,1.0,False
