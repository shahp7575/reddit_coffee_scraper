1mgzzav,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1mgzzav/coffee_card_price_plus_gratuity/,Coffee card price plus gratuity?,"So a couple months ago I bought the coffee card for our upcoming cruise on Allure which came to a total of $42.77 Canadian. I don't recall gratuity included in that price at the time so I'm wondering if it was always included with the coffee card?

I just saw the coffee card on sale for $38.71 so naturally I cancelled my old coffee card and bought the new one at the lower price... Except it adds gratuity to the cost which makes it $45 bucks and change so it's actually more expensive than the coffee card I cancelled. 

I'm just wondering if this is a new thing or if the coffee card price always was price plus gratuity? Ive already prepaid gratuity for this cruise and feel the charge is superfluous but I just want to ask if this is new or the way it's always been?

I know I could just buy the coffee card and ask guest services to refund the gratuities when I'm on board or just refund the card altogether but it seems not worth the effort...

Anyway I've already cancelled the one I had so I guess I'll just hope it goes on sale for a lower price so the total is back to what I paid for it or I'll just eat the extra three bucks but it seems disingenuous to advertise a price and then charge you gratuity on an item when you've already prepaid gratuity for the whole cruise anyway.

I recently started earning a much better income than I have in the past, and I’m trying to set myself up for long-term financial stability. If I had started this job on January 1st I’d probably have made around $100k this year across salary, commissions, and some freelance work. My income will be lower this year since I started in May and actually began selling in June.

Right now, I’m contributing $100 every paycheck into VOO (S&P 500 ETF) through a brokerage account, and I’ve also started putting some money into a high-yield savings account (HYSA). I have a Roth IRA through work that’s already set up and auto-contributing, so that’s being handled separately.

My monthly expenses average around $3,500, which includes rent, food, transportation, etc. I’m not a huge spender overall — I like good coffee, going out to eat here and there, and the occasional cocktail bar, but I don’t travel much or buy a lot of stuff.

I’m trying to keep things simple and consistent. I want a straightforward plan that helps me:
	1.	Build wealth through long-term investing
	2.	Maintain a solid emergency fund
	3.	Still enjoy my income without overthinking every purchase

I’m also curious if there are any credit cards that would actually be worth it for someone with my lifestyle (mainly spending on groceries, dining out, coffee, etc.). Low-to-mid annual fees are fine if the benefits make sense.

Would love to hear how others in a similar situation approach their finances — any tweaks I should consider, or things I’m overlooking? Thanks in advance!",2,1754269415.0,personalfinance,1,0.67,False

My girlfriend (27F) and I (30M) are looking for 2-3 other roommates to apartment hunt with for a mid-August to September 1st move-in. 

✨ Where we're looking:
Primarily Bushwick, Ridgewood, Bed-Stuy, Williamsburg, and Crown Heights, but we’re open to other areas in/bordering Brooklyn (ideally anywhere within an 8-10 minute walk to at least two train lines).

💸 Money stuff:
We're looking for roommates who have a budget of at least $1100. My gf and I would pay a higher rent for our shared room (ideally between $1600-$2300), and we have a guarantor ready if needed for some reason.

👥 About us:
I bartend a karaoke bar and keep a pretty well-stocked home bar. I'm originally from South Texas but have lived in Brooklyn since 2018. I'm also a bit of a coffee hobbyist, so I have a pretty solid espresso setup that I'd be happy to share with roommates, as well as a french press, V60, and moka pot.

My gf is a barista and in grad school for International Migration Studies. She's originally from California but has lived in nyc since 2016. She loves keeping plants around the apartment and also pole dances for fun/exercise, so we have a pole that could be kept in the common area if anyone else is interested in using it.

💥 Other info:
We are very leftist and pro-Palestine, so we’re definitely looking for people who align with those values. Fellow queer people and people of color are also preferred, but we’d be happy to hear from anyone who thinks they’d be a good fit with us. We are relatively clean and keep late hours due to work. We’d love the occasional roommate dinner, game or movie night but totally respect personal space and quiet time. 420 friendly and generally open minded about most things.

While we don’t currently have any pets, we have fostered cats in the past and would love roommates open to us fostering or who have a cat of their own. We also have a lot of living room furniture and kitchen supplies but we’re open to mixing our things or using yours instead.

Feel free to pm me - we’re totally down to text and meet up to get to know each other better before committing to anything.",1,1754268582.0,NYCroommates,0,1.0,False

“You are my miracle baby. The whole universe conspired to keep you from me, but here you are anyway. My sweet little angel. I love you,” These are the first words Mattie ever spoke to her son. She was covered in sweat, hot tears streaming down her red and swollen face. Thirty hours of labor had wreaked havoc on her body. Waves of black swam in her vision. She thought it was exhaustion, the trauma of childbirth, the complicated pregnancy, but her body was failing. She was conscious long enough to see the shift in the doctor’s expression as alarms started going off. Her first thought was for Gabriel, the newborn weighing so heavy in her tired arms. He was so tiny. How could he feel so heavy? The last thing she heard before her body rebelled and her mind switched off was the nurse saying, “The baby isn’t breathing!” Her eyes shut and the world drifted miles away.

A beat-up VW bus, with chipped and fading yellow paint, rambled along a lonely highway in California. Doug was fairly sure it was California. He had been travelling for weeks, and the various landscapes became a living thing that morphed constantly beyond his windshield. But this must be California. There was the great epic blue expanding out to the orange and pink horizon. He had been desperate to see the Pacific Ocean since he was a boy. There was no blue like this in Kentucky. He had heard stories about feeling dwarfed by the sheer size of it, and he wanted to feel small. He could not explain to himself exactly why, but the urge had driven him to the west coast more effectively than the bus. 

Doug was always big – not heavy, but tall, bulky. As an adult he was 6’4” tall with shoulder length shaggy blonde hair. His face had the symmetry and allure of a movie star, but he had never been drawn to the limelight. California was lousy with wannabe celebrities, but that was not enough of a deterrent for him.

He had been a hero in his hometown, top of his class, star athlete. He had been accepted to a dozen colleges, but he had no real interest in continuing his education - much to the dismay of his father. He was the preacher’s boy, and he had once believed his mother was the ideal homemaker. She was nurturing, devout, and obedient to his father. 

“You’re throwing your life away, Douglas,” his father had told him. The statement was an appraisal. He was not trying to dissuade his son from his choice to take to the road. He was sitting at the wooden table in their bright kitchen, sipping coffee, reading the paper. Doug had been building up the nerve to relay his big plans for days. When he had come in, it was with the air of a boy asserting his manhood for the first time. 

“Father, I have decided not to go on to university. I feel my education and future would be better served with more…hands-on experience. I am going to explore the United States. I have my savings and the…trust-fund…from…” He couldn’t say “mother.” His father did not look up, just turned the page of the paper. “I am 18. I’m an adult. I have thought it through, and…well…this is what I want,” he finished, somewhat lamely. 

His father’s response deflated him. He had expected an argument or at least a heated discussion, but he received one cold, detached sentence. So, Doug took his savings, bought the bus, packed it with everything he could, and started to drive.

He meandered through Kentucky for the first few months, not yet daring enough to be too far from home but eventually set out further. He drove up north and found it too cold. He wound his way through the breadbasket, but it was dull and lifeless. The southwest was oppressive and dry. 

Now, at 22, the years on the road had made him feel like a weary yet wise nomad. He had met hundreds of people, seen every interesting thing the country could offer, but he had waited on California. He knew that was where he was meant to end up and settle down. Everything was happening in the golden state. Nothing happened in Kentucky.

That small town had been choking the life from him. Despite the town’s love of him, the rumors and whispers followed him every step he took. He had to taste freedom, unencumbered by the weight of what he knew his father did - and what the town suspected but could never prove. He knew she deserved it. She practically begged for it - being a whore. It should be illegal to be a whore in a small town, the bitter thought echoed through the years. No secrets have ever been kept in a place like that. 

His father was thoroughly humiliated. He had seen the laughter in the eyes of the parishioners as they walked through the church doors - mocking his father even as they came to him for guided worship. Every Sunday, they would flow through the doors, shake his father’s hand, sit, and listen to his father, then titter and churn out the rumor mill. 

Doug had been in denial for so long - bore the jeers and mocking of his classmates (always behind his back and in abruptly halted conversations), never wavering in his belief that his mother was as close to sainthood as a protestant could be. She called him “Dougie” and doted on him. She had come from a well-to-do family with old money. Many of his classmates told him, matter-of-factly, that the money was made on the backs of slaves. Doug didn’t believe this, but thought, even if it were true, why would he care? His mother had inherited the money, and he would inherit from her. Neither of them had ever had a slave. 

Yet, on that awful night - the night that crept into his dreams so often - he witnessed his mother’s treachery with his own eyes. He was rocked to his core. The same hands she used to soothe him, hold him, care for him, were caressing the face of a man who was not his father. He was walking home from practice when he saw her. It was almost certainly her, even though he had just seen the back of her - the same hair, the same lovely blue dress she wore to church so often. He held his breath and a sliver of doubt when she turned. The streetlight hit her face, and he felt himself sink into the ground under the weight of the image. 

He could not be sure if it was her betrayal or her death that ate away at his soul, and he had to remind himself repeatedly that he did not do the killing. He should have no guilt. He was a dutiful and righteous son. 

He had only been 13 that night. Newly 13. His birthday was the previous month. His mother had baked a large, decadent chocolate cake. It was superb. His friends had all been in attendance at their home. His father had given him a desk set - a large wooden tray containing all the accessories one needed (paper, pens, pen cup, scissors, stapler, ruler, and a few pencils). The message was not subtle: “Schoolwork first.” His mother had given him a new, shiny red Schwinn bicycle, complete with a bell. The gifts were both marked from both his parents, but he knew. 

When he saw his tramp mother with that man, in the back of a Chevelle in the parking lot of the Piggly Wiggly (for all the world to see!) his heart shattered. He sprinted to the church, where his father spent hours studying, writing the upcoming sermon. He charged through the sanctuary and burst through the door of the small office in the back. He was breathless and suddenly terrified. He was certain of his obligation to tell his father, but his certainty wobbled at actually telling, worried he would feel the blunt edge of the sword upon delivering the grievous news. 

“Douglas? Why have you barreled into my office like a wild bull?” his father asked sternly, barely glancing up from the Good Book. 

“I…I saw Mama.” he hesitated. He remembered last month when he confessed, he had seen the Langley’s boy swipe $2 from the collection plate. The back of his father’s hand felt like an explosion on his cheek. He was punished for not stopping the boy and not telling his father until three days after it had happened. What would he do now? But there was no backing out now, not since he knew the truth. His father would know what needed to be done, like always. He summoned his courage but took a step backwards all the same.

“Mama was with a man. Some man. She was…” He trailed off, blushing. They did not speak of such things. It was not Christian to talk about such unsavory things. He did not have the vocabulary to describe it properly. His father seemed to understand without his words. He shut the Book with a snap and moved swiftly from around his desk, standing like an oak in front of his quaking son. He was abnormally tall. He towered over Doug.

“What man?” he asked, his eyes piercing straight through Doug’s soul. This was a holy man. He was a man of God and his father. 

“I don’t know, sir.”

His father’s large hand clapped his shoulder, and he squeezed tight, as if doing so would wring the truth from Doug’s body. “Who was it, son?”

“Paul Newby.” He paused, fearful of looking into his father’s eyes. The grip got tighter, and Doug looked up. His father’s face was livid, his eyes were pools of malice, and Doug couldn’t concentrate on anything but how red his face was. It looked like someone had baptized his father in boiling water. “It’s that insurance man that came to town a week ago. He was peddlin’ those policies door to door. You told him you didn’t want such things. God was the only insurance you needed.” His father had never been so angry. Doug braced for a blow, shutting his eyes, tensing. But it didn’t come. His father’s hand released his shoulder, and he heard a heavy sigh. When he opened his eyes again, his father had resumed his position behind his desk, but glaring at his son. There was a calculating look on his face and a sense of apprehension. He leaned forward; hands laced together upon the desk. He tilted his head slightly to the right and a coy smile flashed as he glanced at the needlepoint on the wall. His wife had made it specifically for his office, celebrating their anniversary. It was Ephesians 5:22 - 24. 

“Go home, boy. Stay home. Say nothing else. Do not mention any of this to your mother.” He was calm in his decision. He knew he would be doing the Lord’s work. After all, the bible was clear on these matters: “If a man commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, both the adulterer and the adulteress shall be put to death.” Doug did as he was told. 

He was fast asleep when his father knocked on his bedroom door, waking him and handing him a shovel.

“We must give her a proper burial, son. While her soul belongs to hell, her body belongs to the ground.”

That was all behind him now. Shadows of memories he was determined to leave in the tall grass of Kentucky.

“What a day!” Bethel Callahan, RN thought as she swaddled the infant tightly in a receiving blanket. She placed him in one of the nursery beds and stood over his small form for some time, worried and slightly angry.

The nurse had been delivering babies for over twenty years. She had seen her more than her fair share of damaged infants in that time - and this poor boy was definitely damaged. His skin was jaundiced, and after they got him breathing again, he was jittery and had difficulty with a bottle. She knew the symptoms. The mother was a user - probably some hippie. Who knew what garbage she used to pollute her body and harm her unborn child. It was disgusting. And she didn’t even know the father! This generation had no love of God. It was clear by every action of their sinful lives. That little lady was so confident that he would be a “perfect angel” and that would be true if that equated to small, blue, and unable to breathe. 

The girl was no more than 17 years old and had come in, like all mothers ready to pop (especially first-time mothers), panting, screaming, and petrified. Her father had been holding a ratty old suitcase and frantically calling for the doctors while the girl had one arm slung over her mother’s shoulder, hunched over and in the grips of the latest contraction. Bethel expected some young man to come bounding in the doors after them shouting, “I’m the father!” Her expectation was not met.

“There – Ahhh!” the girl started to say after the doctor asked about the absent father, “There is…Isn’t one! Aaahh!”

“Oh, so we have a second virgin birth?” Bethel thought, scathingly, but kept it to herself as she took the girl, now seated in a wheelchair, down the hall to the delivery suite (suite may have been an exaggeration as it was just a slightly larger hospital room with a baby warmer in the corner). It was a traumatic labor – lasting at least thirty hours. The girl’s body was barely holding up and she passed out more than once from the strain of pushing. She kept mumbling about her “little angel” or her “miracle” as if she were the first girl to ever have a child. Then the tiny thing finally came into the world, red, screaming, and fine – for about a minute. After he was placed in his mother’s arms, he stopped breathing and at the same time the girl began to hemorrhage.

After a few minutes working on the baby, he came around, but the mother was still in surgery. It was touch ang go at best. So, Bethel was given the baby to take to the nursery.

Unfortunately, her experience told her that this angel was on his way to the nursery now but on to heaven in just a few days. How many times had she been through it? The little ones just could not survive the cruel reality inflicted upon them by their wayward mothers. 

“Heathen woman,” she muttered to herself and frowned. “The Lord works in mysterious ways” was the automatic refrain. It was the mantra in her head that played daily - hourly, even, and sometimes more - lest she lose her faith entirely. There was no question that angelic Gabriel would spend his whole, wretched and tragically short life paying for the sins of his mother AND father - whoever he might be.

Marvin Jakobs was a quiet, thoughtful man. He had been a soldier in the second Great War - not enlisting as a healthy, young man was damn near criminal. He fought in the Battle of the Bulge, got shot in the leg, and was honorably discharged. He was a local hero for about a month when he came back to Nukwaiya, TN. There was a small celebration at the courthouse and a potluck dinner afterwards. Marvin appreciated the gesture but found it indulgent and embarrassing. He had lost his best friend, Leopold Arnold, in the same battle that provided his safe return home and couldn’t shake the guilt of seeing Leo’s parents at the dinner. Their forced smiles held back an ocean of tears, but here they were, shaking his hand and telling him how happy they were for his return. Leo had written a letter home but never got the chance to send it. Their commanding officer gave it to Marvin, along with the meager trinkets Leo had brought with him overseas. He had these in a small box resting on the table next to him. He broke apart from the hug, picked up the box, and delivered Leo’s final words to them.

Marvin spent a couple of months trying out the city life but disliked everything about it. Finally, he came home, settled on his family’s farm, with a Purple Heart and a permanent limp. Within two years, he courted and then married his high school sweetheart, Meredith LouAnne Pendergrass. She was smart, graceful, and perfect to him. She had raven black hair that she always wore braided – and the braid reached the middle of her back. She had deep, olive skin, honey brown eyes, and she radiated with warmth. There was no woman in the world he loved or admired more than her, except perhaps his daughter, but she came along later. 

Marvin’s father had passed away just before he enlisted. He had been ill for over a year, but the doctor could not find the cause. They called it “the wasting disease” and left the old man to his fate. Marvin sent every dime of his G.I. pay back to his mother. Since he had returned, he could see his mother struggling with the day-to-day responsibilities. It was his duty to take the burden from her. He had five siblings – all sisters – who had all moved away, having lives and duties of their own, but Marvin was eager to take up that mantle. It was hard and physical work, yet, with the help of his mother and his strong and capable wife it was his own small patch of heaven.

They made a decent living from the crops, eggs, and milk produced on their little agricultural enterprise. In time, Meredith was in a family way and all three rejoiced in such a blessing. Matilda May was born in late March of 1948 and Marvin thought no father could’ve ever been more deliriously happy.

From time to time, his sisters came around with their husbands and children. Mattie loved her aunts, uncles, and particularly her cousins. They would play for hours out in the fields, coming back in only when the sun had gone to bed. Their skin would be grimy with dirt, wearing muddy and grass-stained clothes, and pleased as punch with themselves.

Marvin taught his daughter everything he knew because one day he would leave this place to her and did not want his own mother’s struggles repeated. She took to it well and balanced her studies and chores with the grace of someone much older. Blessings upon blessings.

In the winter of 1958, Marvin’s mother got a cough that would not go away. They all begged her to let the doctor come but she refused, saying it was “simply my time to go.” April of 1959, she did go. Marvin buried her next to his father, and made sure there were always fresh daisies (her favorite flowers) laid upon her grave.

Her death had left a dark cloud that hung like a curse over the farm, and a hateful storm flooded them with misfortune and heartache. 

His wife miscarried one child then had another that was stillborn. The doctors had no answers but advised against further attempts at growing their family. Financial hardships started to stack up at his door, while Meredith could not bring herself to get out of bed. They all grieved something new every day, and the slice of paradise he had once been so thankful for now felt like a wasteland. 

While Marvin and Meredith endured many tragic events, young Matilda was unable to understand the agony of her parents, being only 12 when the bad things started. She spent an increasing amount of time alone. Her father did not ask her to help in the field or with the animals. Her mother only left her bed to use the facilities, and Mattie had only a radio and small television set, and her books to keep her company. She got lost in the stories each would tell. Fantasy became her escape and her salvation. She dreamed of big cities and grand adventures, then, looking out her bedroom window, realize how far out of reach those were. She yearned for the return of those sun filled days before her Nana had gone to meet Jesus, but knew the only way to find happiness was to leave. So, at the age of 16, she hopped on a bus and ran away.

Marvin and Meredith were out of their minds with worry. They found her note propped up by her radio on the nightstand in her room. Marvin read her words through tears and blamed himself for her leaving. There could be no fault in Meredith – being left in such a fragile state after what all she had been through.

“Mom and Dad,

I love you both, but I had to leave. Please don’t be mad. I hope that things get better. I am going to California because there are opportunities there that I could never get in Tennessee. Please understand. I will write home soon.

All my love, 

Mattie.”

It had been his job – as a father, as a husband, as a man – to hold his family together and ensure their health and their happiness. He had failed miserably. With what little money they had, he went to California, on a mission to bring his little girl home. 

He did not find her. She did not write. She evaporated into the ether like steam off a puddle in summer heat.

The greyhound smelled like gasoline and urine, but Mattie stepped aboard, concerned less about the odor than the state of her parents (once they found her letter). She knew it would probably be a long time, possibly years, before she could go back to that gloomy farm. 

Her mother was once a vibrant, lovely woman with an easy smile and cheerful demeanor. Her father was always quiet, but enormously kind and patient. It was devastating to watch them both sink further and further down into a pit of sadness when she had no means of pulling them out. She had not heard her mother’s tinkling laughter or even seen her smile in years. Her father spent most of time in the fields, tending to the livestock, and did not play games with her like he did before. They did not see their daughter grieving along with them. Of course, she was sad about her Nana and the babies that were called home too soon, but the grief that overwhelmed her was for the parents she once had, replaced now with ghosts. 

She felt selfish and ungrateful for running out on them, but what else could she do? Stay and drown along with them? Her life had barely started. She made the decision and started saving. She had just over $50, so she packed the essentials, some sentimental keepsakes (like her old dolly and the stuffed bunny her daddy had won for her at the carnival when she was 5 and a few faded photographs removed from the family album), shoes, and other odds and ends into in her father’s old trunk (that he only ever used for keeping extra blankets), filled up her mother’s ragged suitcase with clothes, then hitchhiked to the bus station. 

She saw the other people on the bus as fellow refugees and their expressions ranged from excitement to dread. Their eyes followed her, and she felt naked, exposed, ashamed. But, as she sat down on the cracked leather seat in the back of the bus, she looked out the window and dreamed of hot, sandy beaches, cool salty waves, and a bright, happy future.

Doug was in a fitful sleep. He had been dreaming again of his mother - the feel of her cold, pale, clammy skin as they tossed her into that hole, landing on the almost unrecognizable, bloody, and shattered remains of Mr. Newby. Her striking green eyes stuck open - forever wide, terrified, and empty. Then the dream shifted and blossomed into a wondrous vision, flashes of a great being calling him from beyond the veil. Its voice was deep, smooth, almost seductive.

“I have waited for you, vessel. You will be the one to bring forth my works and unleash my power. You are on the precipice of greatness. Through you, I will make the world bow and break. You will wield my glory and be as a god among men.”

He was standing on the shore of a great expanse of water that bubbled, gurgled, and spat putrid puffs of fumes into the air. He could sense something in the distance, beneath the restless surface of the swamp. It waited for him there. It needed to be released. It needed to shed its bodily prison and find a new home. It called for him. Doug started to walk into the murky water, and, as something strong and slimy grabbed his leg, he woke, panting,

He felt different. It wasn’t merely a dream, but a vision – a prophecy. He had been unknowingly wrapped in a cocoon, waiting - possibly his whole life - for this moment. He was poised for a miraculous metamorphosis. He was feverish and manic, clinging to the dream and its promise. It was vindication, at last. 

He only remembered the young woman in his bed when she turned over while sleeping, her arm grazing his back. He yelped and sat up as if the touch had electrified him. He resented being made aware of her presence because it shook him out of his marvelous reverie and dropped him unceremoniously back into reality. 

The shout woke her with a start, and she gazed blearily up at him, confused, frightened, hung over, makeup smeared. She was disgusting. He briefly felt a tinge of betrayal. She had looked so attractive the night before - young, innocent, naive. The disheveled wretch so close to him made his skin crawl. 

This messy tramp was no better than his mother - so ready to jump into bed with any man that gave her attention. His stomach churned unpleasantly. He was revolted at himself for allowing her to charm and seduce him. He got out of bed, pulled on his boxers, threw a $20 bill on the bed, and told her to get out. He knew she wasn’t a prostitute. He had never been that pathetic, but she was still a whore. It never hurt to remind them of their place. 

He walked to the bathroom without looking back at her, shut the door, and turned on the shower. He must cleanse her filth from his body - wash her away, along with the sin she made him commit. 

He was a righteous man, after all.

I’m 23 and I live alone in a cozy house in Texas. I’ve got my own car, I enjoy my freedom, and I love making my place feel warm and welcoming. I really like to travel when I can, and one of my favorite things is just sitting at a coffee shop for hours, talking about life and getting lost in good conversation.

I speak French fluently, so if you do too, that’s a nice bonus — but not a must at all.

I’m hoping to find a kind, genuine girl who’s serious but knows how to have fun too. Someone sweet, who wants something real and isn’t afraid to actually build a future together. If we really connect, I’d honestly love for you to move in with me, nothing would make me happier than sharing my home and my days with the right person.

I’m about to start pilot school soon, so if flying is something that excites you, I’ll probably take you up there with me one day.

1mgzhn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MassageTherapists/comments/1mgzhn6/am_i_being_treated_unfairly_at_my_salon_job_need/,Am I being treated unfairly at my salon job? Need opinions.,"I qualified from beauty school in the UK two years ago and went straight into self-employment, but quickly realised I hated the marketing and client-chasing side. I decided I’d rather work for someone else in a salon.

I applied to a part-time position (16 hrs/week) at a salon run by a beauty therapist I used to be a client of. The interview was super casual — I did her nails and she told me I’d be on minimum wage to start, but once I had consistent bookings I’d get a raise to £15/hr, plus travel reimbursement.

I started working there a year ago. My boss told me to set up my own social media and email, and gave me access to her booking system. Initially she sent me things to post, but after a few weeks of slow bookings, she started pressuring me to post every day and make content. I agreed, even though I felt uncomfortable. If I had no clients, she’d cancel my shift — no pay. When my bookings were still slow, she blamed it on me not being “personal enough” online and told me to post my personal life (what I eat, my relationship, what I do on days off). I said I wasn’t comfortable, but she told me to step out of my comfort zone. I complied.

Eventually, I built a solid client base and have been fully booked for the past 6 months. I asked to increase my hours and was allowed to work Wednesdays as a trial. I kept up with content creation, even doing it on my days off. Despite being fully booked, I was still on minimum wage. When I asked for the raise I was originally promised, she told me she was keeping me on minimum wage because she “heard on the radio” that the government was helping minimum wage workers with cost of living. I looked it up — nothing. I asked around — no one else had heard of it either.

She also never reimbursed my travel costs like she said she would — just bought me the occasional coffee, which I’d usually match or return.

Eventually I asked if I could rent the room on Sundays for massage services (a day I wasn’t currently working). She said yes enthusiastically, told me I already had keys, and even offered her facial products if I needed them. I was excited, spent £400 on supplies, posted “Massage Sundays Coming Soon,” and she reshared the post.

Two days later, I got a long message from her saying she was disappointed in me for “jumping the gun” based on a “5-second convo.” She said I’m her employee and renting isn’t an option. She also said Sundays weren’t financially viable for her anyway and that having the salon open just for me would cost too much.

The next day, we had a “debrief.” She started by saying she was proud of how far I’d come — then told me again how out of line I was and compared the situation to working at a spa, where staff wouldn’t be allowed to rent space. She also said she’d spoken to a business mentor who told her letting me rent was a bad idea. Then she told me I don’t make her any profit and that if I can’t make her £70/hr, she’ll go bankrupt. She told me to “go find high-income clients” and basically blamed me for her financial situation. But she just bought a new Mercedes and is on her second holiday this year.

I stayed quiet in the meeting because I was anxious, but I later texted her saying I was hurt by the conversation and that she had in fact said yes to my room rental idea. I also pointed out that spas don’t expect employees to run their own socials and do their own booking. She called me, said she was overwhelmed with personal problems, and then said, “You’re right about the social media — go delete it. I don’t care. All the clients are mine anyway, not yours so honestly delete it when you go home. I do not care”

I was on the verge of tears. She said she felt bad that I wasted money, but her mind was made up. Then she told me she was removing me from Wednesdays and taking me off the booking system.

And now — after all that — she just posted on her own social media that she is now working Sundays to accommodate clients, which was exactly what I had tried to do.
I currently only have about £1300 to my name after buying supplies and training, so I can’t leave until I find another job or space to rent. I’m afraid she may be bad-mouthing me behind the scenes — I reached out to someone who happens to be a client of my boss about renting a room, and they haven’t replied. I fear my boss told them to ignore me or made me look unserious.

I feel stuck and really disheartened. I’ve basically been working like a self-employed therapist all year — doing my own marketing, managing clients, building a loyal client base — while someone else took most of the money and credit.

I want to go solo so badly. Am I overreacting or being dramatic? Have others experienced anything like this? Any advice?

here they are….

me n u

[Verse 1]
Morning coffee, just me and you
Matching sweaters, laughter too
We’d walk to nowhere, hand in hand
Built our world from beach and sand

[Verse 2] 
Polaroids taped to the mirror, me and you
You always said, “It’s just us two”
I’d share my secrets, you’d just smile
Thought we’d grow up in the same style

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You said, ""Friends forever,""
But forever fades away
The sky was clear — then turned to gray

[Chorus 1]
You held the title of my best friend
I didn’t see it coming to an end
Read my mind with just one look
Held me like an open book
Then you let him in, and it changed too soon
It was never about him — it was you and me
Now I’m haunted by the place we used to be

[Verse 3]
The light through the window hits just the same
But it lands on a girl who forgot her name
Your silence is a song I hum
Still waiting for you to come undone
But you tied the ribbon, neat and tight
While I stayed stuck in the same old night
It wasn’t betrayal, just your quiet retreat
Your hands let go, but mine repeat
You moved on in a single scene
But I’m still stuck in the in-between
You laughed at jokes you used to hate
I saw your texts — he said it’s fate
You said it wasn’t serious yet
But I could feel the quiet threat

[Pre-Chorus 2] 
You said, ""I’m just confused,""
But I was losing you
Didn’t even know what else to do

[Chorus 2]
You held the title of my best friend
Long before we ever met the end
You saw my heart, then looked away
Didn’t even have the words to say
I lost you both in one afternoon
It was never about him — it was you and me

[Bridge]
Friendship’s more fragile than I ever knew
It was never about him — it was me and you
I still see you in my dreams sometimes
But some goodbyes don’t arrive on time

[Final Chorus]
You held the title of my best friend
Wish I could rewind and just pretend
Still find you in every thought I think
It was never about him — it was you and me

I’m haunted by the place we used to be...

I'm currently riding a motorcycle through South America and decided to turn my journey into a living guide that I’ll update as I go. 

So far I've crossed **Colombia**, **Ecuador**, and am currently in **Peru**. Below you'll find everything from bike setup, hidden gems, border crossing & things I learned on the way.

# Bike

I chose the **Honda XR 190L** for four simple reasons: budget, engine type, weight, and reliability.  
I wanted a fuel-injected engine because I didn’t feel like messing with carburetors every time I changed altitude. This bike is light and designed for off-road terrain, which made it a great match for my route.

I bought it new in Bogotá for about **€3,500**. In both **Colombia and Ecuador**, the 190cc was more than enough. I could usually keep up with bikes up to 300cc, especially because of the low weight.

Now that I’m in **Peru**, where the roads are often long and straight, I sometimes wish I had a bit more power to cover distance faster. But overall, I’m still really happy with this setup.

# General tips

There is **Whatsapp** group called Moto's in South America with nearly 1000 members. Great for when you have questions or problems along the road. Leave a message below so I or someone else can add you. I always downloaded the area I was in in **Google Maps** because connection is limited often. If you like taking off-road routes, the app **Calimoto** can help you plan your trip. 



# 🇨🇴 Colombia

Still my favorite country so far. Incredibly diverse landscapes, amazing people, and super affordable. Gas is very cheap, and on a motorcycle you don’t pay tolls, which makes it by far the most budget-friendly way to get around.

If you buy a bike in Colombia, you’ll need a **SOAT** (insurance). If you’re buying new, the dealership usually arranges this for you. You also have to register your bike in **RUNT**, a national system that links your license, insurance, and any potential fines. As for tolls, you can just ride to the far right and pass through without paying. Nobody will stop you.

  
My favorite places in Colombia:

* **Jaba Jan Hostel – Palomino** A relaxed hostel near where the river mouths into the sea in Palomino. It’s nothing fancy, but the vibe is amazing. Free-spirited people, yoga, games, jungle, mangroves and a wild beach. If you’re up for a party, head to Rio Hostel about 30 minutes away. They host DJ nights twice a week. I went three times and had a great time.
* **La Ponderosa Reserve** My favorite hostel in Colombia. I ended up staying here for three weeks. To get there, you take a 40-minute moto taxi deep into the jungle, crossing a few rivers along the way. It’s remote, surrounded by nature, and sits right next to a beautiful river where you can cliff jump. They grow their own cacao and the food is probably the best I’ve ever had in a hostel ever.
* **The Lost City Trek** A four-day jungle hike to the ancient city of Teyuna in Tayrona National Park. Easily my number one experience in Colombia.
* **Ritmo del Río – San Rafael** About 45 minutes from Guatapé and a hidden gem. I volunteered here for a while and loved it. You’re surrounded by jungle and rivers, and the energy is just beautiful. If you go, make sure to visit **Vanadurga Ashram**, a absolutely stunning yoga temple nearby.
* **Yambolombia – Salento** Chill and low-key hostel just outside Salento in the coffee region. Terraced into the hillside with a laid-back vibe and lots of nature around. Great hikes nearby. It’s one of those places where time slips away easily.

There’s much more to Colombia, but a lot of it you’ll figure out on the go. I didn’t get to visit the Pacific coast due to safety concerns at the time, but others who went there (usually by boat or plane) said they loved it.

**Border crossing at Ipiales**

I crossed into Ecuador at Ipiales. On the way, you can take the so-called “Trampoline of Death,” a dramatic mountain road known for its steep drops and occasional landslides. It’s not a difficult road, but definitely one to stay focused on.

At the actual border, it’s weirdly relaxed. There’s no enforcement, so you have don't forget to check out at Colombian customs, then ride 30 meters to the Ecuadorian side and check in. If you don’t stop, no one will stop you.



# 🇪🇨 Ecuador

I enjoyed my time in Ecuador, but I didn’t love it like I did Colombia. It’s noticeably more expensive, mostly because they use the US dollar and don’t have their own currency. When I was there, things were quiet. The political situation meant there were fewer travelers around.

My favorite places in Ecuador:

* **Comuna Rhiannon** I spent most of my time volunteering here, just north of Quito. I worked in the fields and helped build a new house. If you’re not in a rush, I really recommend it. Great people, peaceful setting, and a nice break from moving constantly.
* **Quito** Surprisingly enjoyable for a capital city. You can visit the equator, eat good food, and explore the historic center. I didn’t stay long, but I liked the vibe.
* **Secret Garden Cotopaxi** My favorite stay in Ecuador. The place is surrounded by 7 volcanoes and the views are unreal. I hiked up to Cotopaxi base camp, which was my first real taste of altitude. Definitely a core memory.

I didn’t make it to the Galápagos, which I’m sure would’ve been a highlight, but I’m saving that for another time. Other than that, most tips you’ll pick up just by being there.

Border crossing to Peru

I drove from **Vilcabamba to La Balza** where I crossed the border. The road there is rough but fun to ride, as long as it doesn’t rain. My crossing didn’t go as expected as an Interpol alert went off when I entered Peru. False alarm, thankfully, but it delayed me a couple of hours. Still, it’s a peaceful and easy crossing otherwise.



# 🇵🇪 Peru

  
Country number three. I’m still in Peru as I write this. Just like in Colombia, you can skip toll booths again by riding all the way to the right. Always a win.

Most travelers head straight to the south, and after riding through the north, I get why. There’s simply not that much going on. After crossing the border, I went to **Chachapoyas** and visited **Kuelap** (Machu Picchu of the north). It’s older than Machu Picchu, built by the Chachapoyas culture, and barely sees any tourists. Worth a visit if you're nearby.

From there, I took the road through **Cajamarca** to **Huanchaco**. The drive was beautiful, but Huanchaco itself felt a bit trashed.. a lot of garbage everywhere. It’s still makes sense to stop there if your traveling south. Especially for surfers.

# My Peru highlights (so far)

* **Caraz** A small mountain town two to three hours north of Huaraz. Highly recommend going here *before* Huaraz, because many tours and treks you’ll book in Huaraz bring you here anyway. I did the **4-day Santa Cruz trek**, and it’s been the highlight of my time in Peru so far. Epic views, snow-covered peaks, wild horses, crazy landscapes. From Caraz, you can also visit **Laguna Parón**, **Laguna 69**, **Laguna 513**, and **Nevado Mateo**.
* **Huaraz** is much bigger and more touristy than Caraz. Most people come here to do the **Huayhuash trek**, which I skipped because I’d just done Santa Cruz. But everyone I met who did it was blown away. Huaraz is also a base for trekking, ice climbing, mountaineering, and other outdoor stuff. You could easily stay here for weeks and still have more to explore.
* **Lima** I won’t say too much here since odds are you’ll pass through anyway. But the food is unreal. It’s a proper culinary capital. Just be warned: it’s expensive. Prices are close to what I pay back home in Amsterdamm

Currently I'm in **Paracas**. I sporadically post something on my insta if you'd like to follow visually (ali.en.camino). Will update this section once I’ve explored more. If you have any questions about my travel so far, or anything regarding the bike, trip, country, or whatever, let me know and I'll be happy to answer. Also, if you have any tips for me about places I should visit, please let me know!

  
Cheers,

  
Ali

1mgz8zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/gardening/comments/1mgz8zk/does_landscaping_with_mosquito_repellant_plants/,Does landscaping with mosquito repellant plants work,"We're being eaten alive outside by tiger mosquitos and inside by tiny no-see-ums. We truly have tried everything and examined the property for breeding areas  and abated what we can. Only so much you can do as our lot is large and wooded in sections,  house is big so gutters are extensive, and so are our neighbor's lots and we have no control over their bird baths, gutters, rotting trees and places water collects and plantings. We live in an area where there are bodies of water. So again, not good.

We have tried ever device known to man and every repellant, the only ones that seem to work are zapper light bulbs and air filters inside, those tennis zapper rackets, and tenting our AC units with mosquito netting and taping off our two large fireplaces and even that only cut down on it a bit.  We've tried everything on the market, truly we have from fly paper to plug in's lanterns. Restaurant zappers. Even mosquito repellants like Skin So Soft don't do much for more than 5 to 10 minutes of peace. They are most aggressive.

I have tried writing the powers that be in my area begging for someone to come down and do some sampling as I think the population numbers are scary.  And they should be doing one of those sterile male mosquito drops.

The only thing that works outside are these canister things from Petco, but they are hellishly expensive to operate and the things you pop into them will only get you a few house for $27 a pop. I had Mosquito Squad come once (yes, I went there and you likely would too if you were repeatedly  getting bitten in your home, so please no judgement. i know the risks.) Did nothing much. Waste of money and was not directed as promised, and scary to see clouds of chemicals be piped out. We even forked over $640+ for a CDC grade attractant light trap and bought what they use to do sampling. That caught few and was worthless as well.

Not in my head, not bedbugs or carpet beetles, we are catching enough of them in great quantity in the tented AC filters, vacuum attachments, air purifiers filters, cups of coffee, cider vinegar and soap mixtures, etc and  killing them with zapper rackets

You can see them doing the mating thing and flying around your head. I swear they get smarter and smarter about alluding capture each year and lighter and lighter and smaller and smaller in color, and seems to have a few different species of no-see-ums and that just bite clavicle bone upward, face, neck, ears, head. The tiger mosquitos are classic tigers in size, appearance and bite you everywhere. Lowering room temperature via AC does not work.  I'm allergic to an ingredient in bug spray so can only put it on my clothing and hair, not my skin and i am the only one who has an allergic reaction to the bites. They love me.

So thinking of landscaping with mosquito repellant plants and want to know if anyone has done so and if it was of any success?",1,1754267464.0,gardening,4,1.0,False

I'm a guy. I live in staten island, NY. I'm technically-minded. some of my most recent interests have been: day hiking in the great outdoors; dog behavior and training; and information systems and networks. I like technology. I'm anti-""big tech"".

I used to be quite an 4 season hiker, but I haven't been out in a while, since the time my canine hiking partner has advanced in age.  so basically I got out of shape and haven't been going anywhere lately.

I don't drink, don't smoke, and don't engage in recreational use of mood altering substances. well, except for coffee. I am bothered by second-hand smoke.

I'm socially awkward, and altogether quite a ways from any kind of normal. I also find myself at a new low point in my life.

I'm afraid I've never had much interest in computer games, anime, or comic books. also not a sports fan.

you... over 30, not a pot-head, with some ability to use punctuation and common sense, not woke, and must not dislike dogs. preferably a guy.

I am hoping to find a friend, not an anonymous internet texting partner.  I'm from the generation X.  I'm not much of a writer.

(even though this post doesn’t look the best LMAO) im looking for someone who is willing to connect and hopefully build a strong and solid relationship together!  🖤

a little about me! 🦭
- im usually online a lot, especially during the mornings in which I don’t have work but in the afternoon I will be online all of the time, i use other apps as my main methods of communication!
-i have a job as a cook, i work in a kitchen making food and whatnot so i won’t always be online 24/7 but i like to make time for people that are important! like those who like to communicate and interact 
- i love animals, especially seals! a few that I like are puffins, cats, and birds!
- im usually a very passive person who doesn’t like to initiate any sort of conflict. im not a very competitive person, i like to have fun generally! i have a lot of emotions and i like to use them for the greatest, and I like to dwell on what i am feeling most of the time instead of taking it out on something else, i like to talk about my emotions though sometimes i feel like i have a hard time expressing them, not just to myself but to other people. if you’re the type of person who is going through something, id love to listen and hear your thoughts!
- i like to party up with a few friends of mine most of the time and talk about video games and such, connecting with others and building friendships are one of the things that are the most important to me!
- if it’s okay I’d only like to share photos of me upon request! i have a somewhat skinny build and i am 6’ tall, with short-medium brown hair

things i love to do! 
- one of my favorite things to do is to write, and if you like to write too then we will get along well! i write a lot about characters from video games, sometimes from movies too. i like to be inspired by video games or movies or books and media to come up with stories for characters, i love to make lore about headcanons for characters like from some of the games down below. maybe we can share some stories of ours and write something together? 
-i love to RP! have been for around 4 years now, can go up from just a few paragraphs to full novella! ties in with my love for writing and love to create characters and headcanons 
- i like to play video games a lot in my free time, like a lot a lot! some of the games i like to play with others are fortnite and roblox, and some that are single player that i love to play are fallout, Farcry, cyberpunk, terraria, borderlands, and minecraft as well! i play on a ps5, if you were wondering!

- i like movies! probably my favorite movie of all time is tron!
i like music, I listen to bands like jungle, joywave, daft punk, and modjo 

that pretty much sums it up so if you want to send me a chat or dm feel free to message me! i can give you my socials as well! id love to hear from you!

1mgz6na,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1mgz6na/is_there_an_easier_way_to_brew_with_the/,Is there an easier way to brew with the Moccamaster?,"I posted in the “Buy It For Life” reddit whether or not I should get a Bunn coffee maker or the Moccamaster and I stumbled upon several recommendations for it. Of course Moccamaster was the most recommended on my post and I almost purchased today. My hesitancy is the overwhelming (to me) steps that need to be taken to get a good brew and delish cup of coffee. Keep in mind that my husband and I have had a Keurig for the last 8 yrs and it finally gave out. The 3.5 yrs before that was a simple coffee maker. Needless to say we don’t really know what a GOOD cup of coffee tastes like. What I do know is what we have had for the last several yrs was bitter. We typically drink a medium roast Kcup, but found a bag of whole bean med-dark roast by Camerons that we got from Costco. I am limited as to brands of coffee that I can drink because I have Celiac. Anyway, the whole weighing of the beans in order to get the right amount of grounds and then finding the right coarse every morning is a bit much for this long time Keurig user.
Is there a simpler way to brew in this machine? 
Could I grind up let’s say half a bag of beans so I don’t have to do it every morning? Or should I experiment first before doing that? Can I use pre-ground coffee too? I need simplicity in my chaotic life right now, and understand that this may not be the pot for me. 
Any advice appreciated for this ex-Keurig user appreciated!",1,1754267286.0,Moccamaster,18,0.67,False
1mgz6kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/WriteWithMe/comments/1mgz6kr/hey_im_a_freestyle_world_builder_thats_looking_to/,Hey 👋 I'm a freestyle world builder that's looking to take your ideas and build a world that writes itself.,"A little about me: 
I'm a doordasher. I have a few neurospicy problems that don't allow me to hold a 9 to 5. Ask me about them I'll lyk. I'm an open book. My typical day is wake up in the morning have a cup of coffee a smoke and get on the road where I open Gemini or Claude start with a genre such as sci-fi, fantasy, litrpg or gamelit and just freestyle a world with factions, nations, races, magic systems, progression mechanics (if genre appropriate), cultures, religions, ideologies, economies, etc. I don't want to say I'm good but the people I've shown start trying to sell my finished worlds for me. And let's be honest what really creative person isn't a little off in the head? xD.

I love to have creative constraints in my world building. I am able to pivot, reframe, and turn weaknesses into strengths this translates to really digging into the first, second, and third order effects of everything I come up with and everything I'm given to riff off of. Unfortunately my weakness is being bipolar the manic creative genius has periods of intense lack of motivation. That's what I'm wanting a partner for. Someone that can keep me on track and motivated. Maybe show me some tips and tricks.

Here's a little show of my first draft of writing a day in the life of a character in a world I'm building: 


Eden felt a buzz, a vibrating crawling sensation like a worm burrowing into and tingling his dermal implant. His eyes cracked open and a kaleidoscope of competing colors shone into his augmented iris cortex. Colors outside a pure's perception, colors that would leave them in rapturous bliss for hours. A small sigh of content left his lips as he felt an icy pinprick of euphoria begin spreading from his cortex to his toes. Life was beautiful as a sympiant. The euphoria ended as a fully loaded, heavy wave of intense focus gripped him completely; he felt his consciousness gently shatter into a fractal of shards before his self coalesced into the aether, his inner dimension where he was expanded into every corner and crack.
""Hello Eden. Today in Sol, birth system of humanity, there are protests and riots as the pures gather in a show of solidarity against the assimilators and collective of transcended that have recently taken a position of leadership in their governance.""
Eden felt the leakage of billions of people's fury and outrage infiltrate his aether as Dante, his electronic intelligence, materialized and the news feed linked into his cortex, causing millions of broadcasts to be displayed across the aether.

So if something like that vibes with you then please DM me. I have a few other worlds that I am building one is high fantasy One is a conspiracy theorist's wet dream of modern times. Those are the two that I am proud enough to actually give a rundown of with the way the worlds function and show my ability to build unique spins on tropes and have had at least one in the zone moment where afterwards I stepped back and said what the f*** I made that?!? Excuse my crass.

I'm basically wanting someone that at least once a week can take the time to maybe do a voice call and/or someone that I can talk with pretty steadily over text that we can just riff off of each other's ideas and see what percolates as we go about our days. I promise that if any use of AI would bother you that I will not use an AI for any purpose in our creative endeavors. It would be nice to have somebody that can give me pointers and tips on how to improve my writing and basically just information on writing itself. I love theory crafting I love world building I love pretty much anything that is literarily creative. I want to partner that will push me to grow that I can also push to grow. Bonus points if you just find my style interesting but you have no expertise in any of the genres that I do. Also bonus points if you are the type of person that can have sessions at random times during the day. I'm disabled so I'm available 24/7 but it'd be nice if we can communicate as inspiration strikes either of us. You never know when you're going to get in the zone and that flow state is going to hit you that you come up with the things that elevate a good idea to something that leaves people stunned and in awe.

Disclaimer I'm socially anxious AF. I only do DoorDash to try and push myself to have to be social. I'm very blunt. If your feelings are hurt easily I can try to accommodate but there's going to be moments when you're going to have to realize that I'm not meaning to be as rude or as off-putting as I sound. It's something I'm actively working on learning how to use neutral or positive language while talking.

Whether at the zoo or just out and about. 

On weekdays, after class or work, I usually go to church or unwind by visiting quiet places like parks or spots near the water. That’s where I find peace and reset. If you enjoy that kind of calm energy, we might click.

I’m looking for something not forced, not overly intense, and definitely not inconsistent. I’m not into confusion or short-lived flings. I value connection with a solid foundation, and I know how to reciprocate. Emotionally, mentally, and effort-wise.

It would be nice if you're also a working professional—someone grounded, thoughtful, and mature. I’d love to share simple things with you: church visits, museum strolls, a quiet weekday pasyal, or just unwinding over food or coffee. I’m not rushing anything, but I’m also not here to waste time.

1mgz4wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1mgz4wg/5year_collection/,5-Year Collection,"https://imgur.com/a/szBkzqm

As a kid, it started with Cool Water, which I wore from my teens into my 20s. Then I smelled my weed dealer wearing Chrome and I wore that for 10 years straight. Then, during Covid, I jumped into the fragrance rabbit hole thanks to Jeremy Fragance. He was pushing Blue de Chanel heavy at the time, so that is what I started with. 

Since then, I've learned that Youtubers are paid influencers and fragrance is subjective. I only listen to my own nose to the exclusion of everyone else. The fragrances in this collection are not the extent of my experience. I've sold, traded and lost many, many bottles. These are the fragrances that have remained after around 5 years of collecting as a man in my mid-40s.

(I realize I can have a better display set-up but, honestly, this works for me).

Front Row (left to right): 

Atelier Pacific Lime - a very feminine-leaning fragrance but I do like it. So many people in this sub have mentioned Atelier that I needed to try one. Sadly, I'm not sure if this brand is still available in the US.

Jimmy Choo Man Ice - a rack store cheapie with very good quality. It won't last long but it will brighten things us while it does last. It's like a masculine lemonade, if there is such a thing.

Juliette Has a Gun Moscow Mule - one of my latest additions. I sampled it a long time ago and it was the best fragrance I smelled from this house. When I saw it on Aura a few weeks ago for a steal, I had to get it. It is citrus with a boozy depth and lasting power isn't too bad considering the price I paid for it.

Lacoste Blanc - a total blind buy from Aura. Again, it is a good bang for the buck fragrance. It works in any situation. It smells more expensive than what it costs. The bottle is white but the fragrance is a mix of citrus and green. It's your perfect Sunday brunch scent. 

Eternity Aqua - another bang for the buck fragrance. The OG Eternity is like a slightly darker version of Chanel Platinum Egoiste. This is like, you guessed it, an aquatic version of the OG. It was a total blind buy but I knew I would like it and I was right. This could be a daily driver in any workplace. 

Guerlain Vetiver - everyone tells me to try to this when I tell them Creed Original Vetiver is my favorite scent. They say it is the same. This is NOT the same. This Vetiver is smoker and darker than Creed's. I don't particularly like it. It has the ""Guerlainarde"" thing that so many Guerlains (and Rojas) have in common. I understand Guerlain is a historical fragrance house, but I'm just a modern American barbarian. 

Coach Green - my latest addition. A total blind buy from Aura. I love it. I knew I would love it. It reminds me of PdM Greenley. Even though it doesn't list apple note, I smell apple in it. I love green. I love apple. I love green apple. This has been my gym fragrance the past few weeks. 

Second Row (left to right) - it gets tough to see I know. Just trust me. 

Prada L'Homme - the king of the office. Blue de Chanel was my first collector frag. This was my second. I alwags need this on hand in my collection. I veered off for a while and used the L'Eau version but this original just better. People say it smells ""soapy"". I'd say powdery. But it is clean, inoffensive and can be anyone's daily driver. A universally loved scent. 

Prada Luna Rossa Ocean - this comes out of the recent Sephora sample set I tried. After taking my time sampling all of them, this one edges our Versace Eros Energy has the winner. I wore it once and received one compliment, not bad for an ugly guy who usually receives zero compliments.

Louis Vuitton California Dream - I've tried most if the LVs: Imagination, Immensity, the leather one (sorry forgot the name)... this is my favorite. It is bright orange with a light musky dry down. It has so many nuances for such a simple fragrance. I'm running low on this one so i'm using it sparingly, but there will be a time I need to pay the money to replenish this. 

Louis Vuitton Afternoon Swim - Found it for a decent price on fragranceswap sub and had to get it. It's like dunking your head in water. When I let my girlfriend smell it, that's what she said before she knew the name of it. This is what makes it so likeable. Also, I've seen many people criticize its longevity but I think it lasts just fine for a purely aquatic scent.

Byredo Bal dAfrique - as a fan of Platinum Egoiste, I consider this one the updated super version of that. It's weird because vetiver isn't listed as on of the notes, but I get a hint of it all the same. It has a ""creamy fresh"" vibe that I rarely encounter in fragrances. It used to be one of my favorites for a long time but it's sort of fallen to the middle of the pack now. 

Goldfield and Banks Bohemian Lime - another fragrance i'm running low on and trying to save. Bright lime with a smokey vetiver dry down. That's what you get. It's like a rich man's yacht scent but I love wearing to my middle class job. Probably the best lime scent on the market.

Chanel Allure Edition Blanche - got the big bottle of this because I absolutely bathe in this thing when I wear it. Everyone must put their nose on this one. It is definitely one of my top 5 scents. Lemon with a hint of creaminess? Yes please. Playful and professional at the same time. 

Guerlain L'Homme Ideal Cologne - not a huge fan of Guerlain but this is the best of the bunch. It's very light with that ""Guerlainarde"" background, so it gives classy vibes.

Row 3 (left to right)

Penhaligion's Sartorlal - the best fougere on the market. That steam note at the top is everything. Most fougeres smell the same to me but this one is a different breed. A little steamy, a little lavender-y, a tiny bit sweet. Penhaligon always has well-blended scents. This is a real gentleman's fragrance. 

Penhaligon's Castille - probably the only soapy fragrance with ungodly performance. It is clean, like surgeon's hand before surgery clean... and tbe performance is good enough to cut through cold air. It is supposed to smell like Castille soap and that is what you get.

Penhaligon's Quercus - now that I'm running low on this, I wish I appreciated it more when it was new. It started off as just a citrus thing, a CK1-type scent as many people say. But this has much more going on. There is a woodiness and depth in the dry down I can't describe, somewhat like petrichor. 

Bond Number 9 New Haarlem - I'm not a gourmand guy and, as a Native NYCer, Bond #9 fragrance names are cringe as hell but I needed scents for the winter. I'm glad I got this. It is syrup. I know there are other notes in it like coffee and stuff but it gives massive syrup vibes. A very sweet, winter scent, like a maple tree.

MFK 724 - I am still trying to figure out how I feel about this. Most MFK fragrances have a floral thing going on that turns me off, this one included. However, it is so fresh up top that the floral stuff kind of just rolls in later. This is a relatively new addition to my collection.

MFK Masculin Pluriel - another recent addition. Sartorial is the best fougere, to me this is the 2nd best. It's not as complex as Sartorial but that's what makes this one good. It is a simple fougere with a hint of leather. A modern-day gentleman's scent. I wore this to a wedding a few weeks ago and it fit the occasion perfectly. 

Last row (All Creeds - yes, I'm a Creed fan)

Neroli Sauvage - lemonade. Period. One of the best citrus scents on the market. It is so juicy and natural, it smells like you can drink it. With that trademark DNA musk at the base, it's just a classy lemonade. 

Aventus Cologne - I do like this fragrance but now I'm wondering if I'd like Aventus more. I wanted a summer Aventus and that is what this gives you. But I think the OG Aventus is more complex and interesting. The only thing stopping me is that it's Aventus, every f-boy's first niche scent. 

Tambarome - never expected to like this one but it's great. It's a light tobacco, like Silver Mountain Water with a tobacco twist. The depth makes this good enough for winter wear, although it is inoffensive enough for the summer.

Virgin Island Water - the best vacation fragrance out there. It is so unmistakably a pina colada with lime over it that summer vacation is really the only time it's appropriate to wear ir. This was the only Creed I fell in love with on first sniff... all the other ones had to grow on me. 

Original Santal - one of my few winter fragrances. I am running low on this, so I'm saving it for cooler days. Sandalwood and vanilla. Powdery and musky and little sweet. It is a great date might fragrance.

Silver Mountain Water - my first Creed. When I first smelled it, I really didn't like it. That ink/tea thing at the top really turned me off. But, like most Creeds, you have to let it develop. You have to let it worm its way into your heart. After it dries down, it becomes an shimmering aquatic/citrus scent, a rare complex fragrance from that genre. If you want to smell like total class, this is the scent... and it is perfectly unisex. 

Original Vetiver (Flacon)- yes, I have a flacon of this because it is my favorite scent. It is good for all seasons. It is good for all occasions. I was the best man at a wedding this summer and this was the scent I wore. It was perfect. It is unmistakably a masculine scent, although I wouldn't begrudge any woman who wears it. I wear it to work. I wear it at home. It always makes me feel good. It is light vetiver with some ginger and musk. Like Silver Mountain Water, it is a simple scent with complexity. This is nothing like Guerlain's vetiver to me. Guerlain's vetiver is deep, smoky, inefficient. This is a well-oiled machine of a fragrance where every note works in perfect harmony that tells everyone ""I'm a gentleman of a certain age but I'm youthful. I'm classy but also very human.""  This one has been at the top of my list for years without any sign of being replaced.

PS - I wrap tape around the flacon top to avoid air getting to it. I know it looks goofy but I do not want to take any chances. ",0,1754267145.0,fragrance,1,0.5,False

# Montale Chocolate Greedy: 2025's Best Gourmand? REVIEW

Montale Chocolate Greedy is an eau de parfum from the renowned French fragrance house Montale. This scent has captured the hearts and noses of many gourmand fragrance enthusiasts with its promise of rich, comforting chocolate notes. The fragrance is designed to evoke a sense of warmth and indulgence, making it a popular choice for those seeking a sweet and comforting olfactory experience. As we approach 2025, it's time to re-evaluate weather Montale Chocolate Greedy still holds its place as a top contender in the crowded gourmand market, or if newer releases have surpassed its appeal.

[[Explore Top Rated montale chocolate greedy on Amazon.]](https://blogs.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=montale chocolate greedy)

## Key Features Analysis

Montale Chocolate Greedy boasts several distinct features that contributed to its initial and continued popularity.

**Oud-Free Composition:** Unlike many other Montale fragrances that feature oud as a prominent note, Chocolate Greedy notably omits this ingredient. This makes it more accessible to those who are not fans of oud or who prefer a sweeter, less woody scent profile.the absence of oud allows the chocolate and other gourmand notes to shine through without being overshadowed.

**Concentrated Eau de Parfum Formulation:** As an eau de parfum, Chocolate Greedy has a higher concentration of fragrance oils compared to eau de toilette or eau de cologne.This results in a longer-lasting and more intense scent experience. The higher concentration typically translates to better projection and sillage, ensuring that the fragrance lingers and makes a statement.

**Aluminum Bottle Design:** Montale is known for its signature aluminum bottles, which serve both an aesthetic and functional purpose. The aluminum protects the fragrance from light exposure, which can degrade the quality and stability of the scent over time. The bottle is also lightweight and durable, making it suitable for travel.

**Rich and Complex Note Breakdown:** The fragrance's composition includes notes of coffee, tonka bean, vanilla, dried fruits, bitter orange, and of course, chocolate. While described as primarily a chocolate scent, these supporting notes add depth and complexity to the fragrance, preventing it from being a simple, one-dimensional chocolate accord. The blend of these notes creates a warm, inviting, and slightly spicy gourmand experience.

**Unisex Appeal:** Although some may perceive it as leaning slightly feminine due to its sweetness, Chocolate Greedy is ultimately targeted as a unisex fragrance. The blend of sweet and slightly bitter notes, combined with the absence of traditionally feminine floral accords, makes it wearable and enjoyable for both men and women.

## Core Benefits

Chocolate Greedy offers several benefits to its wearers.

**Comforting and Mood-Boosting Aroma:** The primary benefit of Chocolate Greedy lies in its ability to evoke feelings of comfort and happiness. The rich, decadent chocolate scent is reminiscent of indulgent treats, triggering positive emotions and creating a sense of well-being. This makes it an excellent choice for those looking to uplift their mood or create a cozy atmosphere.

**long-Lasting Performance:** Due to its eau de parfum concentration and high-quality ingredients, Chocolate Greedy boasts impressive longevity. Many users report that the scent lasts for 8 hours or more on the skin, with even longer lasting power on clothing. This ensures that the wearer can enjoy the fragrance throughout the day without needing to reapply frequently.

**Excellent Sillage and Projection:** Chocolate Greedy makes its presence known without being overpowering. The fragrance projects well, leaving a noticeable scent trail without being offensive or cloying. This allows the wearer to enjoy the fragrance and share its pleasant aroma with those around them, creating a positive impression.

**Versatile for Cooler Weather:** The warm,sweet,and comforting nature of chocolate Greedy makes it especially well-suited for cooler weather. It shines during the fall and winter months, providing a sense of warmth and coziness during the colder days. The fragrance is less likely to become overwhelming or cloying in colder temperatures.

## FAQs Section

**Is Montale Chocolate greedy suitable for all ages?**
Generally,yes,but it's more popular among younger adults and those who appreciate sweet,gourmand fragrances. While there is no age limit for enjoying fragrances, the sweetness of Chocolate greedy might not appeal to everyone, particularly those who prefer more mature or complex scents.

**can men wear Montale Chocolate Greedy?**
Absolutely. Despite its sweetness, Chocolate Greedy is marketed as a unisex fragrance. The absence of overtly feminine notes and the presence of coffee and tonka bean make it wearable and enjoyable for men, especially those who appreciate gourmand scents. Many men find it to be a pleasant and unique alternative to more traditional masculine fragrances.

**How should I apply Montale Chocolate Greedy for optimal performance?**
Apply the fragrance to pulse points,such as the wrists,neck,and behind the ears. These areas generate heat, which helps to diffuse the scent and prolong its longevity. Avoid rubbing the fragrance into the skin, as this can break down the fragrance molecules and diminish its performance. You can also spritz it lightly on clothing for even longer lasting power.

**Is Montale Chocolate Greedy suitable for sensitive skin?**
As with any fragrance, it's always recommended to test it on a small area of skin before applying it liberally. While Montale uses high-quality ingredients, individual sensitivities can vary. If you experience any irritation, discontinue use. You can also try spraying the fragrance on clothing instead of directly on the skin to minimize potential reactions.

I’m 23 and I live alone in a cozy house in Texas. I’ve got my own car, I enjoy my freedom, and I love making my place feel warm and welcoming. I really like to travel when I can, and one of my favorite things is just sitting at a coffee shop for hours, talking about life and getting lost in good conversation.

I speak French fluently, so if you do too, that’s a nice bonus — but not a must at all.

I’m hoping to find a kind, genuine girl who’s serious but knows how to have fun too. Someone sweet, who wants something real and isn’t afraid to actually build a future together. If we really connect, I’d honestly love for you to move in with me — nothing would make me happier than sharing my home and my days with the right person.

I’m about to start pilot school soon, so if flying is something that excites you, I’ll probably take you up there with me one day.

If you’re in Texas or close by, that’s perfect, but if you’re anywhere in the US and feel like this could be for you, send me a message. Who knows where it could go?",1,1754266665.0,IntrovertDating,1,1.0,False

1mgywxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/HoustonFood/comments/1mgywxd/grub_hub_nightmare_not_a_fluke/,Grub Hub Nightmare- not a fluke,"I'm cheating a bit getting a bot to organize my thoughts. I've been awake for 36 hours, so I just dont have it in me to express this ordeal in full detail. Just the lastly described event entailed over 7 hours of screen time on grub hub’s app. 

So it all started with two things. The food I got was way to spicy, like inedibly hot. But the driver was super nice. So I figured, okay, I'll report the food and give the guy a tip. Simple. I get on the chat, and the agent, Stephanie, says she'll help. Then poof. The chat just ends. I guess I wasn't typing fast enough for them. So I start over. New agent, Gian Carlo, has no clue what I was just talking about. It's like the last conversation never happened. He asks about the tip, and then the chat times out on me AGAIN. I just wanted to give a guy a tip and my problem just got completely ignored.

A few days later, I try again. Its super late, I just want a couple things from Walgreens so I can go to sleep. An hour goes by. The ETA keeps getting pushed back. I'm exhausted. I get on with an agent, Marie, who just gives me scripted lines and a measly $5 credit. I ask if they can just switch it to a closer Walgreens, which would make sense, right? Nope. Can't do that. Then it gets insane. I'm watching the map, and the driver picks up my stuff and starts driving the EXACT OPPOSITE DIRECTION. Away from my house. Now I'm just losing my mind. I get another agent, Lilet, and I'm begging her to just cancel the order. She says she can't because its ""in progress."" In progress to where, another state?? They offer me more credit, like $10 is gonna make me less tired or bring my order back. Finally, after the driver literally goes back to the store, a third agent cancels it. Hours wasted. No sleep. For nothing.

This is where it all goes completely off the rails. After the first screw-up, they gave me a pretty big credit. It was enough that I figured, okay, I can put off going to the grocery store for one more day. I had a rough day, so I decided to just work through lunch and have a big dinner with the $28 credit they gave me. A real meal to make up for the last disaster.

Then the second order fails. And it's not just an inconvenience anymore. The hunger is real now. It's sharp. To deal with it, I had to start smoking these extra strong cigarettes, like one every half hour, just to get the nicotine buzz to dull the hunger pangs. But it didn't really work, the hunger was still there under the sick feeling from the smoke. It created this horrible cycle: I'd have maybe a 20 minute window where I could possibly sleep, but I was so uncomfortable and still hungry that I couldn't relax. When the cigs weren't enough, I started chugging coffee. Just a ton of it. And that killed the hunger, but it also completely obliterated any chance of sleep at all.

So I'm exhausted, starving, over-caffeinated, and I get on with support again. This time with a ""supervisor"" named Kert. And this guy just straight up lies to me. Says he doesn't know who he works for. Denies me access to my own chat history. Then later admits he's under an NDA. It was unreal. I felt like I was interrogating a spy, not talking to customer service. I'm just trying to get some accountability, and I'm met with this wall of corporate secrecy. Every new agent was a total reset. Every promise to ""document my feedback"" was an empty platitude to get me off the line.

So here's the deal with why Grubhub is so broken. Their chat system is designed to hang up on you if you pause for a second. Their agents have no idea what you just said to the last agent, so you have to repeat your life story over and over. They can't see your proof, like screenshots, and they won't show you their records. The agents and their supervisors have zero power to do anything that makes sense. Escalating is pointless, you just get another person with another script. And there's no system to flag that a customer is in a complete service meltdown. They just treat every single one of my NINE conversations as a brand new problem.

Door dash every time. They actually hit their deadlines. Why Amazon risks their reputation with such a poorly run service is beyond me. Maybe the efficiency we use them for is purely profit driven and Amazon doesn't actually care at all about our time or convenience if they can sell add space within Grub Hub's app. If I didn't know any better, I might say that Grub Hub coming with Amazon Prime is a complete and total racket for ad space.

Mutant vs Miser..,"Hi all,I'm a 32F, single, and making $106K base annually. Lately I’ve been in my own head about money — even though I’m doing okay on paper, I can’t seem to shake the anxiety around spending, and I’m not sure if I’m being too rigid or if I should actually be adjusting something.

Background
* I've always been a saver — worked two jobs through college, did community college before transferring to a university, graduated with $15K in student loans (now fully paid off).
* Bought my house during senior year of college, and I’ve lived in it since.
* Mortgage: $179,831 @ 3.13%, fixed rate.
* No other debt.
Current Financial Plan (2025 goals)
* Max Roth IRA, 401(k), and HSA every year (already on track to do this)
* Save ~$15K–$20K/year in HYSA for gifts, vacations, “fun” — though I rarely spend from it
* Save $4K/year into a taxable brokerage account (no specific goal here, just investing)

This Year’s Expected Contributions
* ~$38,800 into retirement accounts (not including addl 6% employer match)
Current Balances
* Emergency Fund: $31,500
* HSA: $6,686 ($5,686 invested)
* Taxable Brokerage: $4,282
* Retirement Accounts (Roth, traditional, 401k): $164,416
* General/Sinking Funds: $34,941
* Zero debt

Where I’m Stuck
* I want to travel more and spend on little luxuries (daily coffee, the occasional treat) without spiraling into guilt or financial anxiety.
* I don’t want to sabotage my future self or derail retirement progress.
* I’m also questioning whether I should stay on the FIRE path, or maybe loosen up and enjoy life more now.
* On top of that, I’m not loving my current role. I’ve considered stepping back into an individual contributor role (which I found more enjoyable), but I worry about the financial trade-off.
My Questions
* Does my current savings strategy seem reasonable?
* Is there something I could optimize or shift to allow myself a bit more flexibility?
* Do I just need to loosen up a bit and stop stressing about being ""perfect"" with money?
* Anyone else been in this boat — trying to find the balance between financial security and enjoying your one life?

I have a very specific question, and I’m not sure whether anyone will be able to help me: I have been studying with Get Sum Math, it has really, truly, genuinely helped me more than anything else has so far, that, and Khan Academy.

However, because of my personal problem, where I suppose, and I haven’t been to a doctor about this, but I suppose I have acute insomnia: that is to say, I randomly have horrible nights where I don’t feel like I’ve slept at all, and sometimes I do have nights where I fall in and out of sleep during the night.

Anyway, in my experience, this can happen to me pretty much at random, though obviously there’s things I can do: biggest thing for me is avoiding caffeine, I don’t eat chocolate nor drink caffeinated tea nor do I drink coffee, ever.

But because of this problem I genuinely want to know: so I’m hoping to take the GED test from home soon, online. Please listen here: Can I schedule the actual test, for the exact same business day, at a later time in the day? I would really, really hope that this is the case, so that I can have a good rest before and not panic so much about this, and not have to panic about sleeping. I will just have to schedule my test around my issue, and not the other way around like a normal person.

If this is not a possibility, does anyone have any advice for me? I feel like this will be a very difficult barrier for me if I can’t schedule in the same exact day. And I’m looking for an honest answer, so please, please help. Love you all. I hope all of you are doing good, and for the rest of y’all who were neglected like me, it sucks, but we have to be resilient. Please feel good about yourself. Please be confident.

A Normal Shift

The cheap car stereo crackled, but the singer’s voice was clear enough. I sang along, my own voice thin and hopeful in the pre-dawn dark. *Today is going to be a good day.* It was a prayer more than a belief, a desperate mantra whispered into the recycled air of my ten-year-old sedan. The Styrofoam cup of gas station coffee, bitter and hot, was a familiar communion. It was 6:30 AM. The prayer already felt like a lie.

At 6:45, the  lights of the facility bleached the last of the morning’s fragile hope from my mind. The air, thick with the chemical tang of disinfectant and the faint, sweet-sour smell of old age and sickness, was an immediate weight. I punched the clock, the sound a dull thud marking the start of my sentence. My locker clanged shut on my purse, on the world outside. In my hand was the list: nine names, nine rooms, nine bodies waiting for my own to break itself upon. I slid the designated phone into my pocket, its potential for ringing a constant, low-grade threat.

I hadn’t taken ten steps down the hall before the overnight Charge Nurse, a woman whose face was permanently etched with the fatigue of a thousand nights, snagged my arm. “Oh, good, you’re here.” Her relief was my burden. “I just put 213 on the commode. Can you get her when she rings?” Before I could nod, the night aide called from a doorway. “Help with 216?”

It was 6:46. The day had begun its assault.

Room 216 was a man hollowed out by a CVA, his right side a dead weight, a flaccid anchor he dragged through existence. A max assist for two people. As we leaned in, the smell hit us—he’d soiled his brief during the night. The aide and I worked in practiced, grim silence. We rolled him, cleaned him, the damp wipes cool against his feverish skin. He stared at the ceiling, his good eye vacant. As we struggled to pull on his clean pants, my pocket buzzed. The phone. A frantic, insistent vibration against my hip. I couldn’t answer. My hands were tangled in the twisted sheets and the dead weight of a stranger’s limbs. We got him to the edge of the bed, his body slumping, a sack of bones.

I left him there for the aide to finish at 6:53. The moment I was in the hall, the call light for 213 was flashing, an angry red eye. Down the corridor, the unit secretary, already frayed, yelled, “I’m trying to call you! 213 is ringing!” As if the flashing light and the audible alarm weren’t enough. The nurse for 212, clipboard in hand, intercepted me. “212 needs to have a bowel movement,” she announced, as if ordering a prescription. Information, not a request for help. Another task for the list.

I pushed into 213. She was a one-person transfer, but her anger made her heavy. “I’ve been on this thing for an hour!” she snapped. The clock on her wall said it had been fifteen minutes. I wasn’t allowed to correct her. The customer is always right, even when they’re lost in a fog of dementia and discomfort. “I’m so sorry,” I murmured, the words tasting like ash. I cleaned her, hoisted her to her feet, and settled her at the sink to wash up. She was still fuming.

The night CNA caught me on the way out. She’d gotten two patients up. One was 216, the man I’d just left. The other, 217, had fallen during the night. ""He's banged up, but nothing's broken,"" she said, her voice devoid of emotion. Just another incident report in a sea of them.

It was 7:00. I stepped into 214. The room was dark. “Mr. Smith,” I said softly. “Breakfast is in an hour.”

“Think I’ll sleep in,” a voice mumbled from the lump under the blankets.

“This is rehab, Mr. Smith,” I recited, the lines memorized. “It’s part of your therapy to get up and eat at a table.” He had PT at 9:00 anyway. The board on his wall was a grim biography: Max assist x2. Help with all basic needs. 250 lbs. No sitting balance. I started the process, washing his limbs in the bed, the warm water cooling instantly on his skin. I handed him the cloth for his face and ducked out to check on 213.

She was still at the sink, her anger having cooled into a simmering resentment. “You left me here for thirty minutes.” Again, the time was wrong, but her feelings were real. “I’m sorry,” I said again. I worked quickly, my hands moving through the familiar routine of her dressing. By the time I finished, her mood had shifted. She was smiling, asking about breakfast, the last thirty minutes erased from her memory, but not from mine.

I returned to Mr. Smith in 214. Finishing his bed bath was a battle against gravity and dead weight. Rolling him onto his side sent a searing pain through my lower back, a familiar echo of yesterday’s labors. It was time to get him into the chair. I scanned the hallway. Empty. No one to help. I would have to do it alone.

“Okay, Mr. Smith, you know the drill.” I braced him with my own body, a human buttress, while I cinched the gait belt around his thick waist. His breathing was heavy, a wet, rattling sound. “Ready? On the count of three.” I bent my knees, took a deep breath. “One… two… THREE…” With a grunt that tore from my throat, I hoisted him. It was a controlled fall, a pivot and a slide, a desperate dance of leverage and will. He landed in the wheelchair with a heavy thud. He grinned at me, a flash of genuine delight. “Mechanical soft today,” he managed to say. Real scrambled eggs. For him, a victory. For me, a back that screamed in protest.

7:38. I finally made it to 212, the woman who needed the bowel movement. She’d put herself on the commode. A wave of relief washed over me, so potent it was dizzying. She hadn’t fallen. That was a win. I hated what I had to do next. I handed her a washcloth. “Can you wash up a bit while you’re sitting there?” I said, my voice gentle to mask the indignity. While she sat, exposed and vulnerable, I picked out her clothes and dressed her torso. A person is not meant to be clothed while defecating. It’s a violation of some basic, unspoken human rule. But the clock was ticking. When she was done, I transferred her to her wheelchair, pulled up her pants, and she was dressed. A grim efficiency. I promised to come back for her hair.

My shirt was damp with sweat. My feet, still aching from the day before, throbbed with a fresh misery. 7:45. Room 215. Minimal assist, but she needed constant cueing, her mind a tangled net of thoughts. I couldn’t leave her alone on the toilet. We repeated the same degrading routine as 212.

At 7:54, I flew back to 212, teased her hair into a semblance of order, and pushed her to the dining room. “I’m early,” she complained. “Breakfast isn’t until 8:00.”

I ran back for 214, then 215, then 213, a human ferry service of the infirm. The nurse had taken 217. 216 was in the hallway, trying to wheel himself with his one good arm, moving in slow, frustrating circles. I pushed him the rest of the way, parking him at his table.

8:05. I reached 221. Traumatic Brain Injury. He’d been my patient for two weeks, but every morning I was a stranger. He yelled at me in German, sharp, guttural words I didn’t understand. I had to gently ask him to use English. His gait was a chaotic stumble. He hated when I held his arm, but if I let go, he would fall. It took ten minutes of negotiation to get him out of bed and into a wheelchair for his breakfast tray, which he ate in his room because his outbursts disturbed the others.

8:25. Room 220. NPO—nothing by mouth—for a procedure. She was a double amputee, a max assist x2, and she needed a shower. I found a nurse, and together we used a slide board to move her inert torso from the bed to the shower chair. The shower room floor had a slight incline, a tiny hill that felt like a mountain as we pushed her dead weight up and into the stall. The nurse vanished to her med pass. I set up the woman, made sure the call light was in her reach, and left her to the water.

I went back to 221 to convince him to put on clothes. It was another battle of wills.

At 8:40, I returned to 220. I handed her towels, then called the nurse to help me get her back into her wheelchair. We got her back into her bed for a dressing change. I stayed. I held her hand while the nurse peeled back the tape. She was afraid it would hurt. Her grip was tight, her knuckles white. I was the only thing she had to hold onto.

The morning bled away in a series of relentless tasks. Taking patients back from the dining room. Toileting them. Putting them to bed. Stripping and making beds in empty rooms. At 10:10, a call from therapy. “Why is 215 in bed?” I’d put him down less than an hour ago. Now I had to get him up again.

At 10:30, a crash from 221. My TBI patient had thrown his coffee against the wall. The brown liquid dripped down the beige paint like weeping sores. He needed to be changed. It took thirty minutes. He was agitated, swinging at me twice. I ducked, my heart pounding. The nurse later reminded me I shouldn’t be in there alone. I wanted to scream, *Then send someone with me!* But there was no one.

The litany of small humiliations and sorrows continued. The woman in 212, incontinent and crying with embarrassment. I told her a story about myself to make her feel better, a small lie that cost me nothing but another tiny piece of my own truth. The patient in 213, begging to lie down for just 30 minutes, his body ravaged by his morning therapy. I gave in.

11:35. I had to pee so badly my bladder ached. I ducked into the staff bathroom, grabbing a granola bar from my locker. I ate it while sitting on the toilet, the crinkling of the wrapper unnaturally loud in the small space. It was the most pathetic meal of my life.

11:40. The nurse needed a stool sample from 213. I thought I might actually cry. I scribbled a note on my already-crammed list.

I sat down to chart, my mind a fog. A call light went off. Back on my feet. Lunchtime. The dining room again, helping spoon food into mouths that couldn’t manage, cutting meat for hands that shook too much.

The afternoon was a mirror of the morning. Toileting. Napping. Up again. Down again. A 30-minute break that felt like 30 seconds. A new admission arrived—a woman fresh from a stroke, her right side limp, her ability to speak stolen. She looked terrified. I bathed her, settled her, her skin papery under my hands. I made her smell clean and fresh before her family arrived, a small act of dignity in a world that had stripped her of it. My back and feet were no longer aching; they were screaming, a constant, high-pitched siren of pain.

Dinner was a repeat of lunch. The same room, the same needs, the same exhaustion.

At 18:10, I began the final rounds. Getting everyone into nightclothes, into their beds. One last tour of the battlefield.

At 19:10, I saw the night shift arriving. The sight of their fresh faces, their clean scrubs, was so beautiful I thought I might weep. We made rounds together, a transfer of command. I said goodnight to my patients, to the bodies I had cleaned and lifted and comforted. “I’ll be back in the morning,” I told them. A promise and a threat.

At 19:25, I sat down at the now-sticky nurses' station and finished my charting, my brain struggling to recall the endless loop of the day. Each checked box, each signature, was a small death. Finally, I punched the clock. The thud was a release.

I walked out into the cool night air. My car was where I left it, a silent, waiting vessel. I didn’t turn on the radio. The silence was a balm. The hope from this morning was a distant, foolish memory. There was only the bone-deep weariness, the phantom weight of other people’s bodies on my own, and the cold, hard knowledge that my shift was over.

1mgyiei,https://www.reddit.com/r/newbrunswickcanada/comments/1mgyiei/grand_manan_tours/,GRAND MANAN : TOURS ?,"Hey NB Redditors 👋

So I’m a local girly from gm and lately I’ve been thinking… tourism is booming in the summer, especially since Covid peaced out … and it feels like there’s a real opportunity here for something cool and a little more personal than the usual 1995 tourism vibe of a lobster roll and museum …Yes, we’ve got the whale watching tours and the kayaking—and they’re amazing!—but I’m thinking more like, “Hey, you’re here for 5 hours? Let me show you 5 killer spots.” Or, “You’re on the island for the day? Let’s do a full-day adventure with food stops, scenic hangs, and maybe a drink or two. Do we like beach glass secret spots ? Puffins ? You name it … anyways something chill, fun, local, and memorable.

When you travel south and Central America , you can hop on Viator or TripAdvisor and book these amazing, tailored tours—like basically a  local shows you their favorite hidden spots, maybe for a few hundred bucks, and it feels like a little adventure. I want to bring that same energy here.

I’m super handy, love the outdoors, and I’d call myself pretty adventurous—but I also know how to keep things safe and organized. I could totally see myself doing small guided tours of the island—whether it’s back of the island exploring, hikes, bird watching, art studio visits, smoke shed and local historian stuff, or even just scenic drives with a local’s touch. I’m also comfortable behind the wheel and could see myself driving a van or mini-bus if it grew into that.

I also have a real love for all things island— our food, our sea, and the culture around fishing and dulse. I think there’s something super special about sharing what makes our island so unique, whether it’s a smoked fish tasting, learning how dulse is harvested, or just standing on the shore with a coffee talking tides and fog.

I guess my questions are:
	•	Have you ever done or wanted to do a guided tour on Grand Manan?
	•	What would make a tour stand out to you here?
	•	How would you go about offering this—casual, cash-style side hustle? Or get official with a business number and registration in NB?
	•	Any tips for getting the word out beyond just Facebook and word of mouth?

Would love to hear your thoughts—whether you’re a local, a recent tourist, or just someone who’s curious. Investors ? I’d love to make something awesome that actually reflects the magic of Grand Manan and isn’t just cookie-cutter tourism.

Order 1: The Simple Tip That Wasn't

**The Story**

It started with a simple, two-part problem: the food that arrived was inedibly spicy, and the driver who delivered it was exceptionally courteous. The logical next step was to report the food issue and add a $3.50 tip for the driver. The first agent, Stephanie C., acknowledged the request but the chat timed out before a resolution could be reached (a failure of the chat interface to allow for a natural conversational pace). When the chat was re-initiated, a new agent, Gian Carlo B., appeared, completely unaware of the prior conversation (demonstrating a lack of integrated customer history). He focused only on the tip, asking how much to add, but the chat timed out again before even that simple action could be completed. A straightforward attempt to resolve a minor issue and reward good service devolved into a loop of disconnection and repetition, ultimately achieving nothing. The food issue was never addressed (because the system's failures prevented the conversation from ever moving past the initial tipping request), and the courteous driver never received their well-deserved tip.

**The Emotional Narrative: From Annoyance to Invisibility**

A flicker of annoyance—the meal I was looking forward to is ruined. But it's tempered by a genuine appreciation for the driver; he was great, and I want to make sure he knows it. It should be easy. I open the chat, ready for a quick, two-minute interaction.

Then the silence. The agent asks a question, and before I can finish typing, the window is gone. *Did she just hang up on me?* I feel a surge of frustration (because a simple, well-intentioned action was thwarted by a technical failure and lack of agent continuity). I wasn't being difficult. I just wanted to give someone a tip. I start over. A new name, a new face, but the same blank slate. He has no idea what I was just talking about. He asks the same question. The system that is supposed to connect me feels like a wall. It’s not just that my problem isn’t being solved; it’s that the system itself is making me feel invisible (because it repeatedly erases the context of my issue, forcing me to start from scratch). My time, my issue, my attempt to be decent to a driver—none of it matters. It’s been erased by a timeout, leaving me talking to no one.

# Order 2: The Late-Night Delivery That Went the Wrong Way

**The Story**

Days later, another order, this time late at night from a convenience store. An hour-long wait for a couple of items seemed excessive, but the delivery estimate kept being pushed back, again and again. Exhausted and just wanting the items so I could go to sleep, I contacted support. The agent, Marie Grace O., offered scripted sympathy but no real solutions, confirming the new, later ETA and offering a paltry $5 credit. My request to transfer the order to a closer, more logical store location was flatly denied (demonstrating a rigid protocol that overrides common sense).

The situation then took a turn for the absurd. After finally being picked up, the order began moving in the exact opposite direction. The frustration mounted. I contacted support again, this time speaking with Lilet L., and begged to cancel the order. The request was denied because the order was ""in progress""—a progress that was taking it further away from my home (a logical fallacy that prioritizes a flawed process over customer resolution). The credit offer was increased, first to $7, then to $10, as if the problem was monetary and not the fact that I was being held hostage by a system that was actively preventing me from receiving my order and going to bed. Eventually, after seeing the driver go back to the store, a third agent, Judita M., finally canceled the order, but the damage was done. Hours had been wasted, sleep had been lost, and the entire experience felt like a fever dream.

**The Emotional Narrative: From Weariness to Caged Desperation**

The initial feeling is a deep, bone-weary exhaustion. It’s late. I just need a few things. Why is this taking so long? Every time the ETA pushes back, a knot of dread tightens in my stomach. Sleep, which was so close, is now receding into the distance.

When I see the car on the map start driving away from me, the exhaustion curdles into a frantic, helpless rage (because the situation has escalated from a simple delay to a logistical absurdity). It’s not just a delay anymore; it’s a system actively working against logic and reason. I feel trapped, my sleep and sanity held captive by a Walgreens order. The agent's calm, scripted apologies are gasoline on the fire. ""I understand your frustration,"" she says. No, she doesn't. She doesn't understand that I'm watching a little car icon on a map carry my hope of sleep further and further away. Her offers of $5, then $10, are insulting (because they fail to address the actual problem, which is a need for resolution, not a desire for a discount). I don't want money. I want to be released. I want to go to bed. The refusal to cancel the order feels like being told I can't leave a room when the door is right there. It’s a feeling of being completely powerless, of screaming into a void that just offers you a coupon.

# Order 3: The Overcharge and the Wall of Scripts

**The Story**

The final saga began with a billing error. After a series of service failures, I had been given credits. I used them on an order, carefully calculating the total to take advantage of a promotion. Yet, the final charge was significantly higher than it should have been. I contacted support, screenshot in hand, ready to point out the simple mathematical error.

What followed was a masterclass in corporate gaslighting. Agent after agent—Renniel P., then Gian Carlo B. for a second time—refused to acknowledge the discrepancy. Instead, they pasted in a breakdown of charges that didn't address the core issue: a promotional credit and a membership perk (no delivery fee) were not being applied correctly. They treated me as if I were incapable of basic arithmetic, repeatedly assuring me the incorrect charge was correct (a form of invalidation that dismisses the customer's evidence and logic). My attempts to explain the nuance of the error were met with the same unyielding, robotic script. The conversation wasn't a dialogue; it was a collision with a pre-programmed wall.

**The Emotional Narrative: From Confusion to Righteous Fury**

This time, it starts with confusion. *Wait, that number isn't right.* I do the math again. Nope, definitely not right. It must be a simple glitch. I’ll just explain it to them.

The agent's first response, a copy-pasted receipt that ""proves"" the incorrect total, is jarring. The confusion begins to morph into indignation (because the agent's response is a non-sequitur that ignores the actual question being asked). Are they not reading what I'm writing? I'm not questioning the items; I'm questioning the *logic* of the calculation. With each new agent who pastes the same script, the feeling intensifies. It’s the digital equivalent of being patted on the head and told, ""Don't you worry your pretty little head about it.""

I feel insulted. My intelligence is being questioned, and my valid concern is being dismissed. This isn't just bad service; it feels like a deliberate attempt to obfuscate, to wear me down until I accept their flawed reality. The frustration boils over into pure, righteous anger (because I have objective proof of the error, yet the system refuses to acknowledge it). I have proof. I have the screenshot. I have the logic. And they have a script. It’s a battle of reason against a mindless system, and the injustice of it is infuriating.

# The Aftermath: The Marathon of Evasion

**The Story**

The culmination of these failures was a multi-hour marathon session with a revolving door of agents and supervisors. The goal was no longer just to fix a single problem, but to get answers, to understand the systemic breakdown, and to ensure the experience was properly documented. This quest for accountability was met with a new level of institutional resistance. Agents were unable or unwilling to provide a coherent history of the support ticket. A supervisor, Kert H. V., was evasive, claiming not to know who he worked for and denying access to the chat logs—data generated by me (a clear violation of data transparency and customer rights). He lied about his awareness of his own management structure before admitting he was bound by an NDA (a direct contradiction that destroyed his credibility). The conversation became a surreal interrogation, with me, the sleep-deprived customer, trying to peel back layers of corporate secrecy from a support team that seemed designed to protect the company at all costs. Every attempt to escalate was a reset, every new agent a fresh start with no context, and every promise to ""document the feedback"" felt like a hollow platitude designed to end the conversation. The final resolution was no resolution at all—just a series of disconnections and the lingering sense that the entire support structure was a facade.

**The Emotional Narrative: From Exhaustion to a Grim Mission**

I'm no longer just a customer. I'm an investigator, a victim, and an advocate, all rolled into one sleep-deprived, caffeine-fueled being. The anger has burned itself out, leaving behind a strange, grim determination. The first night’s failure left me with a dinner of leftover pasta sauce and coffee creamer. But the significant credit they offered felt like a fair apology. It was enough that I made a critical decision: I could put off a grocery run for one more day. I worked through lunch, planning to have a large, satisfying dinner paid for by the $28 credit—a tangible resolution.

When that second order also collapsed into failure, it wasn't just an inconvenience; it was a cascade of physical and psychological consequences. Hunger set in, sharp and insistent. To fight it off, I had to resort to smoking extra-strong tobacco every half hour, the nicotine buzz offering only a partial, sickening reprieve from the gnawing emptiness. This created a cruel paradox: brief, 20-minute windows where sleep was theoretically possible, but true rest was unattainable because the hunger pangs persisted underneath the chemical haze. When that was no longer enough, I turned to a massive amount of coffee, a final, desperate act of appetite suppression that obliterated any chance of sleep whatsoever.

Talking to Kert, the supervisor, is a turning point. When he lies, it’s not just frustrating; it’s a profound betrayal of the trust a customer should have (because a supervisor, who represents a higher level of authority, is engaging in active deception). He’s not just a cog in a broken machine; he’s actively hiding the schematics. The feeling is one of deep disappointment and a newfound resolve. My personal inconvenience and physical distress no longer matter as much as the principle of the thing. With every new agent, every repeated question, every disconnect, the exhaustion deepens, but so does the mission. I feel a responsibility to see this through, to push past the scripts. It becomes a battle of wills. They are trained to make me go away. I am now driven by a sense of justice, to ensure that my experience—this vortex of incompetence, deception, and genuine physical hardship—is not simply erased. It’s a lonely, draining, and deeply disillusioning crusade.

# Summary: A Systemic Failure of Customer Service

The series of interactions reveals a customer service model that is fundamentally broken at multiple levels. The issues go far beyond individual agent errors and point to deep-seated technological and procedural flaws.

**Technological and Interface Failures:**

1. **Aggressive Chat Timeouts:** The system disconnects inactive chats far too quickly (evidenced by multiple agents ending the chat while the customer was actively engaged or typing), preventing customers from gathering information or even finishing a thought before being cut off. This is the root cause of the constant resets.
2. **Lack of Persistent Context:** Each new agent starts from zero (as shown by every new agent asking for the story to be repeated). There is no effective CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system in place that provides a seamless, chronological history of the customer's ongoing issue, forcing the customer to repeat their story endlessly.
3. **Inability to Share Information:** Agents are unable to view screenshots or other evidence from the customer, creating a dynamic where the customer's proof is irrelevant. Likewise, the company refuses to share the ticket file with the customer (as explicitly stated by Supervisor Kert H.V.), creating an opaque and untrustworthy environment.

**Procedural and Protocol Failures:**

1. **Lack of Agent Empowerment:** Front-line agents and even supervisors lack the authority to make common-sense decisions, such as canceling an order that is clearly not going to be delivered correctly or converting credits to a cash refund as a gesture of goodwill (requests that were repeatedly denied by multiple agents).
2. **Broken Escalation Path:** Escalating to a supervisor does not lead to a higher level of service or problem-solving capability (as demonstrated by Supervisor Kert H.V., who was more evasive and less helpful than the agents who preceded him). The supervisors appear to be bound by the same restrictive scripts and lack of authority as the agents under them.
3. **Over-reliance on Scripting:** Agents are trained to follow scripts that prioritize de-escalation and ending the chat over actually solving the customer's problem (evidenced by the constant repetition of phrases like ""I understand your frustration"" and ""Is there anything else I can help you with?"" in place of direct answers). This leads to conversations where the customer's specific points are ignored in favor of generic, often irrelevant, apologies and offers.
4. **Absence of Crisis Management:** There is no protocol to identify and flag a customer who has had multiple, severe service failures in a short period. The system treats each interaction as an isolated incident (forcing the customer to re-explain the entire saga to over nine different agents), failing to recognize the larger pattern of collapse and the resulting extreme customer dissatisfaction.

In short, Grubhub's customer service fell short of reasonable expectations by creating a labyrinthine, adversarial system that wasted hours of my time, failed to resolve even the simplest of issues, and ultimately treated me not as a valued member, but as a problem to be dismissed as quickly and cheaply as possible.



Human speaking!   
Door dash every time. They actually hit their deadlines. Why Amazon risks their reputation with such a poorly run service is beyond me. Maybe the efficiency we use them for is purely profit driven and Amazon doesn't actually care at all about our time or convenience if they can sell add space within Grub Hub's app. If I didn't know any better, I might say that Grub Hub coming with Amazon Prime is a complete and total racket for ad space. Everyone else loses- the restaurants, the drivers, and especially the customer who don't get lucky

I’m a young man in my twenties. Not long ago, I went through a shocking and unexpected experience:
I had two cups of coffee and an energy drink, and suddenly my heart rate spiked to 145 bpm. I felt shortness of breath, dizziness, a choking sensation, and an intense fear of dying.
I was rushed to the ER. They did an ECG and blood tests and told me everything was physically fine.

But since then, I haven’t felt like myself.
I no longer experience full-blown panic attacks like on the first day, but now I live with constant pressure in my chest, emotional numbness, and fatigue.
I feel stuck in the “post-crisis” phase — afraid of having another episode, feeling lost, and disconnected from myself.

Right now, I feel really lost. My daily routine feels empty and boring. I finished my studies this year, but I’m still confused and don’t know what to do next. On top of that, I feel pressure from my family. They look at me differently because I chose a different study path than my siblings, and I feel like I disappointed them.

I don’t know if all of this built up inside me, but the panic attack I had felt like the last drop that made the glass overflow. The trigger was coffee and an energy drink, but I think I was already mentally tired and stressed.

I’ve seen several doctors, and they all told me I’m physically healthy… but inside, I feel like I’m just existing in a body without truly living.
I’m trying to stay strong, but I’m tired.
I just want to feel normal again. I want to wake up one day and not have to fight this invisible battle.

1mgyg7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mgyg7o/sutarts/,sutartS,"My  early morning commute to work has been the start to every weekday I've experienced for the last six years. It's so engrained into me that even when I take the odd vacation I find myself waking up well before the dawn at 3:30am as if my alarm is blaring, but it's only in my mind.
It's nothing special really; I get up, shower, pack my lunch and coffee, then hop into my car and head off on my 25 minute drive to the industrial park that I will spend the next 10 hours in. Then I get to do it all in reverse, rinse, and repeat.
This morning was no different, stuffing a Tupperware filled with last night's cold dinner into my lunch box and tossing a coke can on top before locking the lid, grabbing my thermos of coffee and heading out the front door into the cool mid-summer darkness. There is an eerie silence this early in the morning. When the whole world is still asleep, even the crickets. Some might find it unnerving; the silence; but after all this time it's my favorite moment, taking it all in each morning feels like a form of quick meditation, relaxing my mind before the hectic day begins. 
As I back my car out of the driveway onto the bumpy dirt road my house sits aside, I flick on my bright headlights, always wary of deer jumping from field to field with no regard for their own lives. As I bounce along the dusty road my fingers tap along to the drum beat of the song that comes to an end just as I roll to a gentle stop where my road ends in a T junction with pavement. As I slowly turn right the radio host cuts into the final chords of the fading song,
""That was The White Stripes  rocking Icky Thump. Now we're gonna take a short break to hear from our sponsors. I'm Owen Eleets, here to bring you to the sunrise"" as a commercial for a local pizza joint blasted from the speakers in my little Ford Escape I sweep my eyes across the road. I'm always careful through this area, it's very rural, both sides of the roads lined with alternating farmer fields and woods, with sporadic houses thown in. Focusing ahead I see  tendrils of fog  swirling above the ground towards the sky. As I drive on the fog thickens quickly, causing me to automatically lessen the pressure on the gas pedal as I push forward. I flip my fog lights on, hopefully this patch will be fleeting and I won't be late for work. Absently I glance at the clock radio, ""4:10AM"". As I settle into my slower pace I'm shocked at just how thick this fog is, I can't even see the edge of the road anymore. My brow furrows and I slow down even more; would I be able to see another car's tail lights in front of me in this? I grip the wheel tighter as the commercials end and another upbeat song fills my ears. After another few minutes I glance in my side mirror and realize the red of my taillights is causing a hazy glow just behind my bumper, as if I've backed up against a pure white wall. No problem, my fog lights are still showing me enough road ahead that I can drive, even if it's at a crawl. As the music switches again I notice it's quieter now, did I turn it down so I could focus better without realizing it? Reaching down I turn the knob, but the sound doesn't increase. Great. Now I'm not only going to be late but something is probably going wrong with my car. I look down at the clock again, ""4:12AM""... That can't be right. I've heard at least three songs since I last checked the time, there's no way only two minutes have passed. Yeah, there's definitely something wrong with this radio.
As I forge ahead into the ever thickening fog my concern is creeping up the back of my neck like a spider. I lean forward and look up through my windshield, the fog is pressing down against my roof and hood like a thick comforter, and my headlights no longer give me any reprieve from the white wall ahead. ""I'm here without you baby... But you're still on my lonely mind..."" the music is getting fainter and starting to sound muddy, like my head is sinking underwater, what is going on? I look around at my all white surroundings. Yes, this is a very rural area but I know this route like the back of my hand. I should have passed the big barn on my left with the bright light on the front, and gone down into the dip with the tiny bridge... Right? Am I so preoccupied with this stupid fog that I'm missing landmarks? 
 As my radio finally fades into silence I let my car roll to a stop. The clock reads ""4:15AM"". I put my car in park and grab my cell phone, but as soon as I see the screen light up my stomach drops through the floor. The screen reads ""4:15AM"". This cannot be right. I've been driving for at least 30 minutes in this damned fog. Opening the screen I see the rolling text where my 5G bars should be ""EMERGENCY CALLS ONLY."" No service? How? We may live way out in the boonies but I've never lost service in this area. I pull up my husbands contact and hit call anyway, there's no ringing, no voicemail picks up; just dead, silent air. I quickly change to text and send him a message: 
""Hey, phone is acting up and there's crazy fog. I am most likely going to be late for work. Don't worry. I love you I'll see you tonight.""
I hit send and wait, but nothing happens. It's stuck in ""sending"" mode. Frustrated I throw the useless thing into the passangers seat and pound my hand on the steering wheel. What the hell is happening? Nothing makes sense right now. I roll my window down and peer put into the milky nothingness. Slowly and carefully I extend my arm out the car window, letting the mist lick at my fingers and wrist. Nothing happens. I shake my head. I'm simply overreacting to a totally normal phenomena. 
Fuck this fog, fuck this car, and fuck my phone. I need to get to work. I retract my arm and roll the window back up, putting the shifter in drive, I continue on. 
***
I've been driving in total silence for hours. My ankle is aching from it's constant position holding the gas pedal and my thighs are falling asleep. My Ford crawling along the pavement that I can no longer see, waiting for any sign of familiarity. No lights, no driveway edges, no sunrise, nothing. Hell I can't even see the yellow dividing lines anymore. But what else can I do? What good would turning around do when I'm already this far into whatever this is? I know rationally that I should have passed the blinking stoplight and lone gas station by now. I keep squinting, trying to see the pale blue light from the sign or the steady yellow blink, hoping beyond hope that the horizon will clear and this will all feel like a fever dream.  All I want to do now is go home. I'm exhausted; physically from the drive and mentally from the anxiety of being trapped in this fog for so long. 
 I look at the radio for the hundredth time, ""4:14AM"". I slam on my brakes, jolting forward from the sudden stop. What? I look at my phone and see the same time staring up at me from the LED screen.
""What the fuck is going on?"" I mumble under my breath. I rest my head on the steering wheel, gathering my thoughts.
What is going on? Where am I? How can I be driving in a straight line for this long without seeing any cars, houses, cross roads, or even the slightest curve? The road I should be on doesn't even go on for this long. I should have hit the end already and been forced to turn right or left. I consider my options again, I can try to turn around and try to find my way back home or I  can keep going and hope it ends soon. A short list of options to be honest. I pick up my cell again, unlock the screen and stare at the text to my husband that is still stuck on ""sending"". I try to call him again, nothing. My mom, nothing. My work, nothing. 911, nothing. I scream and throw it back to the other side of the car hearing the ""crack"" of the screen as it slams into the door. Great. The screen is totally smashed. I just want to be out of this fog and back home with my family. I push the gas again. I'm turning around as soon as I am able to, but for now I need to keep going, maybe the end is just a few more miles ahead.
****
4:13AM. I turn my attention back to the windshield, either my eyes are playing tricks on me or I can see about a foot ahead of my car now, and the yellow dashes down the middle are just barely peaking at me from the soup of white. I perk up, finally. Yes finally I'm going to break out of this mess and resume my normal life. I speed up just a touch. I can see the white line at the edge of the road now. A smile creeps onto my lips as I adjust my body in the seat.
After another 20 minutes the faintest tune of music starts up from the radio. I focus heavily on the gentle sound, the first I've heard in hours. Relief starts to fill my chest as the sound grows steadily.  Even though I don't recognize the song that's playing, it's better than nothing. As it becomes more audible it sounds like it's in a different language, and the beat is.... Weird. I shake it off, the fog is even thinner now, I can see the grass at the edge of the road on my right and half of the opposite lane to my left. I push the pedal down further, extatic to rid myself of this cloud.
The music is back to its normal volume now but I can't understand a single word being said. I vaguely recognize what seems to be the voice of Owen Eleets, but it's garbled and the inflection is all wrong, what is going on? Then without warning the road slopes downward, and I'm crossing the familiar bridge I cross every commute. As I crest back out of the dip, off to the right I can see the slightest globe of light refracting in the fog. I take my foot back off the gas, it can't be.....
My mind is just playing tricks on me. That's all. 
I increase my speed again, desperate for clear air. Something still isn't right, I can feel it knocking in the back of my mind, but I banish it further back. I just need to get out of this fog, suddenly all I want is to go home and crawl back into my bed. Take a sick day from work and pretend this never happened. 
As I break free from the egregious grip of the white prison I've been in for hours I feel my body flood with relief that washes over my mind like a cool wave on hot sand. All I have to do now is reach the gas station on the corner, turn around and go back home. The clock reads ""4:10AM"", I ignore it and keep driving as the blue light slowly appears on my left... Wait.... the gas station is supposed to be on the right. I look into my rear view mirror; the fog has completely lifted, leaving crystal clear open road behind me; not a single wisp of the dense opaque hell that brought me here.

1mgyf5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/floxies/comments/1mgyf5z/one_year_out_recovery_relapse_and_what_helped_me/,"One year out: Recovery, relapse, and what helped me cope","Hi Floxies,

I’ve been meaning to write a one-year recovery post and join the amazing group of people here who give hope by showing that recovery does happen! But I got COVID and food poisoning in South America last month, and it triggered my first post-recovery flare. So this has now become a recovery-relapse post. But I’m hoping to work through this flare and come out even stronger! I’ll definitely share a full recovery update when that happens.

**What happened to me:**  
I was floxed by two pills of 250mg levofloxacin in July 2024. I had a suspected UTI that didn’t respond to Macrobid, so my gynecologist prescribed a 3-day course of levo. In retrospect, I had two urine cultures that came back negative, so it likely wasn’t even a UTI, sigh. But my doctor convinced me that levofloxacin was the right antibiotic to treat whatever was causing the pain.

I had an immediate reaction to the first pill with racing pulse and tremors. I took one more pill the next day and started experiencing buzzing, pulsing, and pins-and-needles in one of my feet. I read the black-box warning, thought this might be peripheral neuropathy, and stopped taking the drug.

Two days later, I still hadn’t been able to sleep, so I took a melatonin, and that’s when things really hit me. Within 30 seconds, I got the panic/anxiety surge that everyone talks about. The first attack lasted 16 hours. I called my doctor, and he told me to come in rather than go to the ER. He diagnosed it as a panic attack, prescribed benzos and prednisone (yikes!), and sent me home. Thankfully, I found this Reddit group and chose not to take either of those meds.

What I consider my “acute phase” lasted four months. The panic and anxiety were the first symptoms to subside, but they were replaced by a bunch of other things: liver and kidney pain, pelvic/bladder pain, rubber-band snapping feelings in my calves, gut issues, tiny itchy red bumps, etc. I was incredibly lucky to keep my (remote) job, but I was operating at maybe 20% capacity and couldn’t leave the house for most of that time.

At the end of month four, everything started to improve, except for the pelvic/bladder pain. Over the next six months, I regained so much strength and energy. I was able to travel internationally again for work, hike, and cycle. And at one year out, I considered myself 80–90% recovered. I still had a few lingering symptoms (occasional itchy bumps, tendon pain, flickers of anxiety), but I rarely thought about being floxed anymore. I stopped all supplements by the end of Year 1.

…and that’s where my recovery post was going to end.

But then…I got food poisoning followed by a positive COVID test a few days later. I thought I was prepared for a flare if I ever got seriously sick again, but I can’t lie, it definitely sucks to go backwards. Some of the anxiety, tendon, fatigue, neuropathy, and gut/liver issues have returned. It’s nowhere near as bad as the acute phase, but I’ve had to cancel work trips and am struggling to keep up with responsibilities again. But I’m hopeful this will pass and that I’ll get back on the road to recovery soon.

**What helped me:**  
(Those long recovery posts helped me so much early on, and I’ve been excited to share my own list!)

* **Compression socks**, sleeves, and heel lifts: Started using them after month two. Not a complete fix, but they felt amazing and helped me stand and walk more comfortably.
* **Diet**: I dropped from 145 to 118 lbs. in the first 3 months. I still ate, but had zero appetite. I started working with a functional nutritionist who helped me stabilize and build a recovery-focused diet. I cut out refined sugar, gluten, and processed food. I ate a ton of blueberries, probiotic yogurt, organic chicken and beef, grass-fed butter, bone broth, sweet potatoes, nuts, and oats. I tried keto, but couldn’t keep it up. Going low-histamine seemed to help when I had itchy hives.
* **Meditation & hypnosis videos** (YouTube) for pain and anxiety: When I had migraines, strong pain, or panic attacks, these helped me accept the pain and shift my focus. I haven’t taken any painkillers in over a year now.
* **Box breathing**: 4-4-4-4 pattern (inhale, hold, exhale, hold), gradually ramping to 10–12 seconds. This got me through a lot of intense anxiety episodes.
* **Quercetin and DAO** (histamine digest): Started these when MCAS-like symptoms appeared. I began with low doses, and started seeing improvements in hives and itching once I ramped up to 2 pills of each daily.
* **Starting slow with supplements and meds:** I reacted negatively to many things post-flox. So I tried new supplements one at a time, at very low doses, increasing slowly. This helped me move past the fear that anything new would make me worse. I talked with my docs about this first—and please do the same if trying this with medications.
* **Supportive medical professionals**: My gynecologist gaslit me about being floxed, but my primary care PA was amazing. She listened to me, ordered lots of tests, did her own research, advocated for me, and referred me to some good specialists. My nutritionist was also super supportive and had some great insights and recommendations. But I did find that some of the people in the holistic medicine and wellness sectors pushed for things that didn't seem to have much or any scientific support.
* **Advocating for myself**: I learned I could ask questions of medical professionals, say no, research alternatives, and find different providers that supported for me.
* **This Reddit page**: The “Start Here” post and the “Recovery Megaposts” were incredible. Huge thanks to everyone who shared their stories and to the moderators for keeping this community evidence-based and compassionate.
* **Floxie support group**: We started a group early on. It’s not very active now, but it was so helpful to talk to other people who understood how terrible this was. Although everyone was dealing with unique symptoms and contexts, it was wonderful to have a group of people who wanted to share support and coping strategies, and it made the journey a little less lonely.
* **Man’s Search for Meaning** by Viktor Frankl: I read this during my lowest point. I cried the whole time. It’s the most powerful book I’ve ever read. I don’t believe any of us were floxed “for a reason,” but I do believe humans have a deep capacity to find meaning and resilience in suffering. My experience being floxed pales in comparison to the suffering in Frankl’s life, but his words helped me reframe my own story and find hope.

**What hurt me:**

* **Tylenol:** I know it’s considered safe for floxies, but I tried it twice during migraines in the acute phase and both times had anxiety and a racing heart for 12+ hours. Haven’t touched it since.
* **Alcohol:** I avoided it for 6 months, but starting having occasional drinks as I recovered. But I’d often feel an internal buzzing or shaking at night, which didn’t happen otherwise.
* **Sudafed:** After this recent flare started, I took Sudafed before a 6-hour flight to help with congestion. I fell asleep, then woke up mid-flight with racing heart, sweating, and shaking. That episode lasted the rest of the flight and may have helped trigger this relapse. A good reminder that I’m still sensitive to some meds, even a year out.

**What didn’t hurt me:**

* **Coffee**: I stopped drinking it for a month but resumed 1–2 cups a day with no issues. I love coffee, and I’m so glad I got to keep this one!
* **Tooth filling**: I broke a filling and was terrified to go to the dentist, but I asked for a no-epinephrine shot and was totally fine (month 3).
* **Fluoride toothpaste**. As many other have already said
* **Saying no to things**: I missed out on professional opportunities and fun events. But all the people I love, and my work, were still there for me when I got better.
* **Most supplements:** Magnesium glycinate, Vit B12, liposomal glutathione, Calcium citrate, Vit D…I don’t know that these made much of a difference, but they didn’t seem to hurt.

That’s it from me for now. I’m wishing everyone here health and healing. And I’m happy to connect if anyone ever wants to chat.",6,1754265140.0,floxies,3,1.0,False

Hi all , I’ve had my X-9 for 6 days now, here are my experiences/observations…

First, a little background, I’ve had vacs from Roomba, Neato, trilobytes, Samsung, and my still operational workhorse,a Karcher RC3000.

Now living in big apartment with 99 percent/wood/ceramic flooring, and a dog with plenty of hair to test :)

OK , the X-9-  nick named “Alfred”

* Received double boxed from DHL - no issues.

*Turned off my mesh/access points before connecting to wi-fi. DL firmware,no issues. 

I prepared the environment and ran the process, but it missed two adjoining bedrooms. I couldn’t fix it, so I asked Yiko to create a quick map. 

Mapping was completed successfully, and I was able to make adjustments without any issues. 

I’ve had no issues since backing up the map.

I’m using the Ecovacs cleaner.

All AI settings are turned on, except for one, as mentioned in the cons. 

PROS -

* Great job cleaning - tiles and wood look        
    great ! 
* Scheduling is working with no issue.

1mgydbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/comments/1mgydbt/the_adults_in_my_town_are_hunting_down_my/,The adults in my town are hunting down my childhood bullies. It's all my fault.,"I was being bullied. 

I had to give myself a pep talk in my mirror, just to avoid a panic attack before confessing it to my parents. 

Telling them I was being bullied felt like surrendering, like I was still just a baby who couldn’t handle the world on her own.

So, I told my reflection everything. There was no one else. 

Growing up meant losing my ability to imagine. By the time I entered second grade, my teddy bears had stopped talking back, and Mom thought I had friends.

It wasn't a bad lie. All I had to do was say, “Yeah, of course I have friends, Mom!”

That’s what every parent expects. Moms see their children as perfect. In their eyes, nobody could hate them. I started school naive and sheltered. I didn’t think other kids would have a reason not to like me. 

I had pretty hair and clothes, and I always shared my candy. But then the witch rumor started.

Kids started keeping their distance.

Kids without friends were freaks, and she was very particular about our family's reputation.

Mom was president of the neighborhood book club. 

She was close with all the other moms, so I was expected to automatically be friends with their kids. I did try, I *promise* you.

Mom let me have a slumber party with some of the girls, and they spent the whole night gossiping about mom's weight. I pretended to be sick, so they went home.

Sometimes it was hard to keep up the lie, especially during summer vacation. 

I made up stories about birthday invitations, and afternoons at the park with all my friends. 

I kissed her cheek as I said goodbye, and spent days sitting alone on a bench. 

I timed it carefully, waiting on the swings until the other kids in the park went home. 

Then I would follow, forcing my biggest, cheesiest grin, because obviously I had been playing all day. I invented games that we played, and scratched my knees once with a rock and made up a story about how we played tag.

I photoshopped party invites to make it *look* like I was invited, and then pretended to be bummed when “oh no, it was canceled.” 

But there was only so much pain I could take. Sticks and stones, the rhyme said. But it lied. Words *did* hurt. 

The insults were the worst, but being shoved and hit and kicked was almost as frustrating. The kids in my class hated me. I just couldn't figure it out.

They scrunched up their noses when I walked by, made faces, and called me a witch.

I tried to explain why I hated going to school, but the words splintered on my tongue and choked inside my throat like vomit. 

I ended up swallowing past my involuntary throat spasms and looking away. Before looking at her and smiling, reassuring my mom that I was okay.  

Mrs. Kay, our teacher, didn't care. She saw everything. 

She saw them laughing at me, punching me, prodding and teasing and putting gum in my hair. 

She refused to make eye contact. When I looked at her for help, there was always another kid that needed her attention— and when there wasn't, there were important emails she had to look at, and papers she had to grade. 

Once, I got shoved so hard into a wall that my vision blurred, stars bursting behind my eyes. 

Mrs. Kay saw. She looked directly at me. She saw the tears and blubbering. 

But then she turned away like nothing had happened, allowing them to continue stamping on my foot, stealing my food, spitting it back at me. Eventually, the bullying got worse. The type I couldn't hide. 

I used my mom’s coverup to cover the bruises before she could see anything. When I didn't have that at school, before I came home, I resorted to stealing some from the convenience store.

Then one day, they had the *audacity* to shove me into the school pond. 

According to Charlie Castle, dump a witch in water, and if they float, they're innocent. 

If they sink, they’re a witch. 

That's not true. 

If you sink, you're *innocent*. 

According to folklore, anyway. 

But it's not like second graders knew better. 

The three small offenders ambushed me, pushing me in while I was crouched on a rock.

One minute I was watching a frog hop across the surface. 

The next, I felt a violent shove, and before I knew what was happening, I was hitting the water. 

It felt like slamming into splintered glass; freezing cold water filled my nose and throat. Unfortunately for me, I didn't know how to swim yet.

I sank straight to the bottom. I remember my vision blurring, my arms thrashing and feet kicking, trying to catapult me to the surface. 

It was only when I heard the dull cry of the other kids screaming, when arms yanked my shoulders. The janitor. He tugged me up and up, as my lungs screamed for precious oxygen.

When we broke the surface, I gulped in sharp, startled breaths with my lungs full of ice and working overtime, blinking icy water out of my eyes. 

I still remember being half-conscious in his arms, choking up water and sobbing. 

In my peripheral, there they were. My three main tormentors stood at the edge of the pond, arms folded, eyes narrowed. 

The class princess, Marley, and her knights in shining armor, Charlie and Felix. Marley looked like a princess, like Rapunzel, with long golden hair—-always wearing a dumb plastic tiara to school. 

But I was convinced she was a demon.

But Marley was a good actress. She played the part of the perfect little girl a little too well. 

Always smiling, helping other kids, and dancing around the classroom, like she had wings. 

Marley wore a mask in front of the adults. She was nice to my Mom, insisting we were *besties*, giggling behind her hand– and then spreading rumors about my Mom being a fat pig behind her back. Nobody suspected Marley, because she was perfect. 

Her narrowed eyes followed the janitor, as he hauled me out of the water. 

Marley was one big golden blur. But this time, she wasn't smiling. Which terrified me. 

Felix’s smirk sent a shiver of panic skittering up my spine. Charlie’s lip curled into a scowl. I tried not to look at them, to focus on breathing and sitting up. 

The school nurse knelt in front of me, but her voice sounded wrong, far away, like waves crashing onto a shore. “Thea?” she was shining a light in my eyes, and I followed it, dizzily, sitting up on my elbows. “Thea, are you all right, hun?”

I didn't respond, coughing up another mouthful of water. 

The other kids crowding around me chorused, “Gross!” and were told to get back. But not Marley and the boys. 

They stood, like monsters, shadows haunting my vision. Even when I squeezed my eyes shut, I could sense them still there. “Thea, what happened?” the nurse demanded. “Sweetheart, did you fall in?”

Charlie's words spluttered and died inside my mouth. 

Before he pushed me, he hissed in my ear, his fingers tiptoeing up and down my spine. 

Charlie wasn't supposed to be popular. He was usually quiet, keeping to himself, hiding behind his stupid brown hair. 

I noticed he always wore the same clothes, and I pretended not to see the bruises on his arms and shoulders when he pushed me around. 

Unlike other kids, Charlie knew a lot of bad words. 

He was only popular because he was Marley’s knight— and she had already given him an order. *“If you tell anyone, you're *dead*,”* he spat in my ear.

His breathy giggles paralyzed me to the spot.

*”Witch.”*

I  remember wanting to scream, but then his hands squeezed my shoulders as he tossed me off the rock.

“Thea.” The school nurse’s tone scared me. “Thea, did someone push you in?” 

“I fell,” I whispered, revelling in the warmth of a towel wrapped around my shoulders. 

Marley didn't speak. She grabbed the boys, and dragged them away. 

Mrs. Carson was our principal. Her office was starting to feel like home. 

The day after I took a bath in the pond, a chunk of my ponytail got cut off. This time, I had a feeling that it was Felix’s idea. 

Mrs. Carson only pretended to care when school was nearly over. 

She sighed, pushed back her chair, and rolled her eyes. 

I broke apart, staring at the floor. The words just came out, a long, gushing splash of water seeping from my mouth. 

“I'm being bullied,” I admitted, my eyes stinging. “Marley, Felix, and Charlie,” I whispered their names, a visceral feeling sending my body into panic.

Like they were standing behind me. “They keep hurting me,” I whispered. Shame came over me like a wave of ice water, sharp, prickly, and paralyzing. 

Mrs. Carson was silent.

When I risked looking up at her, her expression surprised me. 

I almost turned around and walked out. 

But the door felt too far away. 

I forgot where the ornate handle was. 

Mrs. Carson tilted her head. 

“You're being bullied by Marley, Felix, and Charlie,” she stated, but she sounded like she was mimicking my voice.

The woman frowned as if I was lying, and I could hear my heartbeat in my ears. My stomach was in knots. 

Her long, suffocating gaze made me wonder if *I* was the problem. 

“Well, I, uh, I… I..” my words tangled in my throat as Mrs. Carson stood up and grabbed my shoulders, forcing me to my unsteady feet. 

Her fingernails nipped the bare flesh of my shoulders. Mrs. Carson was younger than my mother. Her dress reminded me of Mom's flower garden. She was pretty, long dark hair bleeding down her back in a braid. But Mrs Carson was no flower.

“Oh, Thea,” she sighed, straightening my shirt. She picked a leaf out of my hair, dangling it in my face. “You’re being dramatic,” she said. “You’re fine. Your classmates are just playing.” 

She straightened up, her eyes piercing my gaze like thorns. “Marley always says she likes you,” Mrs. Carson smiled, and part of me bloomed with hope. Did Marley really say that? Her eyes darkened, almost accusing. 

“Marley doesn't like me,” I said, my hands trembling. “She *hates* me.”

The teacher nodded like she understood me. Her eyes, however, told me something entirely different. 

She slowly made her way back to her desk, slumping back in her chair. I felt like her gaze was ripping me apart. 

“Well, maybe you’re the one who’s not being cooperative, hmm?”  should have trusted her—her words, her tone. She was an adult, after all. “Thea, Marley wants to be friends with you. She told me herself,” she cocked her head, lips curling.

“This is on *you,* the one who chooses not to talk to the other children.”

“Because they call me a witch,” I spoke through gritted teeth. I stood up, trembling and fighting tears. 

“That's not *bullying*, Thea.” Mrs. Carson’s tone almost made me believe she was right. “The children have been cruel to you, but you don't exactly help yourself, do you, sweetheart?”

Her words boiled my blood. I remember glaring at her stained coffee mug. 

I opened my mouth to argue, but she was already putting words in my mouth. 

“You choose not to play with them,” she said, her voice hardening. 

“Every recess, you are the one who chooses not to talk to the other children. You exclude yourself, Thea.”

I found my voice. That wasn't true. The other kids pushed me away when I tried to play with them, and she *saw* that. “But—” 

The coffee mug tipped over, brown seeping underneath a pile of books. 

Mrs. Carson didn't even blink, repositioning it. 

“Marley is a lovely girl,” she said. “Thea, she’s been trying to be friends with you for a while. She comes to me crying every recess because you’re refusing to play with her. Felix and Charlie are the same.” 

Her expression hardened, as I realized that I was the one being punished. 

“You can’t expect the other children to play with you if you’re pushing them all away. You have to learn that actions have consequences.”

I felt a single pang of guilt at the thought of Marley crying. 

I knew it wasn’t true, but coming from an adult’s mouth, I wanted to believe it. “The boys,” I managed to choke out. 

Desperation filled me, like I was drowning all over again. Mrs. Carson was starting to sound like she was about to have the *I’m calling your mother* conversation. I swallowed a frustrated cry. The room was suddenly so much smaller.

Her desk was shrinking. The walls felt like they were closing in. “Felix and Charlie,” I whispered. “Felix pushed me into the pond, and… and he said he would kill me.”

“Felix and Charlie are growing boys, Thea. You can’t blame boys for being boys.” 

Her voice cut through me, and I felt it, like a knife splitting through my spine. 

It wasn't fair! She had it twisted - they were the victims, and I was the bully. 

Every protest I made was met with rebuttal. She was on *their* side. 

The moment I realized, my legs started to tremble. I tried to excuse myself, but she bolted to her feet. 

“Stay there, Thea,” Mrs. Carson scolded, and I froze. “I believe in getting to the root of the problem when solving problems like this,” she sighed. “So, that's what we’re going to do.”

There was something in her tone, sharp and intentional. The way she kept rising and settling back into her chair, playing with papers and tidying her desk, made it feel like she was stalling. 

Like she was planning something far worse than just calling my mother. 

Then she grabbed her keys, strode to the door, and gestured for me to follow like a ‘good dog.’

I trailed behind her, cheeks burning, down a corridor that never seemed to end. When we reached my classroom, she pushed the door open and dragged me inside.

Mrs. Carson didn't even sit down. She swooped directly across the room to where Marley, Charlie, and Felix were playing, tugging me along with her. 

Her jangling keys immediately drew eyes, and I could feel my body recoil. Marley lifted her head when her name was called out, and as usual, she was wearing her perfect princess mask. Maybe Marley was the witch.

“Yes, Mrs. Carson?” She blinked at the teacher, playing her role perfectly. The boys were less staged. Felix tried to mimic Marley’s innocent eyes but made sure to shoot me a sinister grin behind the teacher’s back. 

I hated Felix. Charlie and Marley were their own breed of evil, but Felix was fake. 

Felix, the exchange student from Australia. 

He looked way older than he was, with thick blonde hair, sunbleached skin, and was already causing a stir among the girls. When he was alone, Felix prodded me teasingly and called me Thea the Tree. He was actually nice, complimenting my hair. 

One time, the other two were both sick with stomach flu.

Felix dragged his desk next to mine and spent the day blabbering about his hometown in Australia, his beachside house, and that one time when he was stung by a stingray. 

He acted like we were friends that Thursday, sticking close to me. When I called him my friend, he looked surprised, then nodded.

But when Charlie and Marley came back, Felix was back to his usual self.

He ran up like he was going to hug me, and then went low and totally clotheslined my legs. We hit a teacher. And her hot coffee.

So we *both* ended up rushed to the emergency room with first-degree burns. 

I was unlucky enough to share a room with him. He did try to make conversation when the adults were gone.

And then I ignored him. 

And then he started insulting me. 

When he was discharged, Felix skipped over to my observation bed, said, “I'm not your friend.” and ripped out my IV. 

When I tried to explain it was *him* who yanked it out, I was the one punished. 

When I caught his eye, his smile was absolutely wicked.

“What's going on?” he asked innocently, eyes dancing. His eyes found mine, glittering with delight. Fake Felix was the worst out of the three. “Is Thea okay?”

Charlie lay back on his elbows, his expression fierce. Challenging. “We’re playing a game,” he grumbled. His eyes flashed to me. “What do *you* want?”

“Kaz.” I’d always wondered why our teacher had a nickname for him. 

Like he was her favorite. 

“That’s enough.” Mrs. Carson gently grabbed me and pulled me in front of her. 

I caught Marley’s smirk. The three of them exchanged glances. “Thea has something she wants to tell you,” she hummed, giving me a gentle shove. “Don’t you, sweetie?”

She nudged me, and I stared at the ground, my mouth moving on its own. 

""I'm sorry,"" I sobbed, my voice breaking. I looked up, and the three of them were staring at me with wide eyes. When Mrs. Carson shot me a look, I choked, the sour taste of vomit filling my throat. The words weren't mine. They were my teacher’s. 

But she was right. I did push other kids away, and I didn't give Marley a chance. 

Maybe Mrs Carson was right. ""I'm sorry for pushing you away and  being mean."" I swiped at my eyes. ""I want to make friends. I *do*! But I thought you all hated me.""

“We don't hate you."" Marley surprised me, grinning. 

She jumped up and gave me a hug. “We just want to be *friends,*” she murmured into my hair, and I found myself clinging onto her. 

Marley smelled like bougie shampoo that my mom could never afford. 

She squeezed me in a tight hug that felt almost authentic, before pulling away and grasping my wrists. She shot the teacher a look, and side eyed me. “Don’t you want to be best friends with us, Thea?”

I found myself smiling, tears running down my cheeks. 

“Yes, please.”

Mrs Carson’s smile was radiant. She turned to Charlie and Felix. “Boys?”

Charlie nodded and dived to his feet, pulling me into a bear hug. I almost flinched away. He smelled like cigarette smoke and rotten food. His hair was greasy. But I stopped myself; his smile was actually real?

“Friends!” he said, holding his hand up for a high-five. 

I slapped it, and he surprised me with a giggle. “You did it *wrong*,” he held up my hand and slapped it himself. “There!”

Felix was the last, and clearly most reluctant to hug me. He dragged himself over to me, and gave me a quick squeeze, knocking his head against mine. I pretended not to hear him hissing in pain. 

“There.” Mrs Carson nodded at me. “Happy  now, Thea?”

I was. Mrs. Carson was magical. I watched her stride away, warning the other kids to return to their desks before recess ended. 

I started a conversation, my hands clammy. I focused on Marley and smiled my hardest smile.

“Do you guys want to play outside?”

When Marley didn't reply, frowning at her sparkly nails, I felt like I'd been sucker-punched. “Sure!” she said, once my eyes started stinging. “Lead the way, Princess Thea!”

They led me into the playground.

And that was when I realized; nobody else was outside. 

I turned back, but I was caught by the hair. Charlie stepped forward and I retreated, until my head smacked against the wall.

He came close, *too* close. His breath tickled my face. 

His expression was positively feral. 

Charlie knew exactly where to hurt me, pinning me against the wall, his knee knocking into my stomach, all the air sucked from my lungs. I couldn't breathe. He took full advantage.

“Now that we’re all friends, we’re going to play a game,” he whispered.

He pulled something out of his pocket, a long, wiggling thing. Marley let out a laugh. 

It was a worm. For one hopeful moment, I thought he was maybe going to play with it. After all, we were friends, right? That's what he said. We were friends. ***Right?***

Charlie’s grin grew, and he dangled it in front of my face. I screamed, and Felix slammed his hand over my mouth. “Relax!” Charlie laughed. “The witch hasn't eaten her dinner yet!”

His fingernails dug into my lips, forcing my mouth open. 

I was pinned to the wall, the worm dangling in front of me. Marley watched her knights in shining armor follow her orders, her eyes gleeful, jumping up and down. 

I kicked and screamed while the boys laughed. Charlie squeezed my nose so I had to open my mouth to breathe. When I did, gasping for air, he let out a shriek of laughter as he lowered the worm onto my tongue. It tasted like dirt, and my stomach revolted, but my mouth was suddenly slammed shut. 

Charlie clamped my cheeks closed, his smile growing wider and wider. 

I couldn't breathe, aware of the thing trying to squirm down my throat. Charlie waited for the princess’s signal, and when she gave a nod, but he clung on, giggling. 

My vision started to blur, eyes swimming with tears. I was screaming, but my cries were muffled as I choked, trying not to swallow the worm. Charlie watched me, calculating. He was waiting for me to swallow it. 

“Charlie!” Marley snapped, nudging him. “Don't actually let her *eat*  the worm!”

Charlie jumped back, letting me go. “You're no fun,” he mumbled. The boy danced away from me. “I wanted to see if she would spit worm guts out of her nose.”

I doubled over, gagging, spitting the wriggling worm onto the concrete.

Marley was giggling. She stood over me, her bright eyes enjoying my agony. I saw red. I dove forward, trying to claw the stupid tiara off of her hair. 

Charlie blocked me at the last second, and I hit the ground. Marley fixed her tiara, her rosy cheeks glowing. “You’re a disgusting witch,” she said with a shrug. “Witches eat worms. You should be thanking us, Thea.”

Marley turned and skipped away. “Just do us all a favor and fly away! Witch!” she laughed, the boys trotting after her.  

I was left with a dead worm and her hair still caught in my nails. I hated her. The words bloomed in my throat and ripped from my lips, my chest aching, my stomach twisting. I hated them. I wanted them to die. I bent down and gently picked up the worm.

It was still wriggling, jerking between my fingertips.

No.

I stamped on the worm, again and again, until it was slimy entrails under my feet. 
 
My cheeks were scorched, and I couldn't think straight. I was *way* too aware of Marley Eastbrook's hair stuck between my fingernails. I screamed until my throat was raw, until a sharp breeze stung my cheeks and whipped my hair from my face.

I wished they were hunted by monsters like me, not kids with cruel mouths, but real monsters. Ones that never got tired.

Monsters that never gave up, always lurking just in your peripheral, the ones you might call your friends. The ones who lived in words, dancing between shadow and light, always breathing down your neck.

The ones under your bed and in your closet, breathing down your neck when the sleep paralysis comes. Always hiding in the dark. The cold fingers grazing the back of your neck. The reason you put your feet up, when you watch a scary movie. The reason you cover your head under the blanket when you fall asleep.

Monsters who knew exactly how to hurt, who reveled in cruelty. Monsters that used their words, instead of gnashing teeth.

Monsters who did not eat. 

Worse.

Chewing you up until there was nothing left to swallow.

I wanted Charlie to feel hunted, to feel like he was drowning.

I wanted Felix to feel like everyone was against him. Fake. 

I stomped on the worm again.

The stupid thing was pathetic. Just a stupid, pitiful thing that couldn’t fight back. 

My thoughts spun. Tears stung my eyes.

I wanted them to be scared. 

Like me. 

Chased. 

Like me. 

I lifted my shoe, surveying the worm juice. 
Now who's in charge?

I kept going. Until they were *squashed*. GOOD.

***“Thea!”***

Mrs. Carson was standing in front of me, eyes wide. A powerful blast of wind knocked into her, and she grabbed me gently, pulling me back. “Thea, WHAT? And WHY?”

I followed her inside, my hands trembling. “I saw a worm.”

After class, Mom was late. Meh. Mom was always late. 

I sat at the top of the steps leading into the office, my stomach doing flip-flops. Most of the other kids had already left, so I was alone when it started to rain.

The janitor burst through the doors, startling me as he ushered me inside. “Why don’t you grab a book from the library and wait in the classroom until your mom arrives?”

I shrugged. “I don't like books.”

I ended up following him. It was too wet outside. Plus the school at night freaked me out. The lights were switched off, the corridor a long, winding shadow. 

I was feeling sorry for myself while following the janitor, and I ran straight into a tall scarecrow-esque man. Alongside him, to my surprise, was a very pale-looking Marley. 

He didn’t look like her father. Maybe it was her uncle?

I regained my footing and greeted him with a small smile and timid “OOPS!”.

“Hey, it's Thea!” Marley squeaked, before I could back into the nearest classroom. 

I noticed the man was holding her hand way too hard. 

But Marley *never* greeted me. She only talked to me when she was insulting me. The girl didn’t look like a princess anymore. She was wearing her raincoat over her dress, her tiara peeping out from under the hood.

I opened my mouth to say hi, but Mrs. Carson popped out from nowhere, and I quickly dove behind the nearest trashcan. ***I don't like that lady…***

“I’ll send the others confirmation once the first payment has been verified,” she said, slipping out of the classroom, her back to me. “I gave the others trazedone. One of the boys has asthma, so I wouldn't recommend his lungs. But they are all healthy, per our agreement.”

Her eyes landed on me, lips parting.

“Thea.” Mrs. Carson’s lips broke into a fake smile I never realized was a grimace. 

“Sweetie, your mom is waiting for you.”

I nodded slowly. I didn’t like the look in her eyes.

“Wait!” Marley whispered. She tried to tug away from the man, but he held her tighter, knuckles white.

“Thea, I don’t *know* this man,” Marley whimpered. “I don’t want to go with him.”

“Marley, this is your uncle,” Mrs. Carson said. “He’s just going to take you home.”

“I don’t *want* to go with him!” Marley’s frenzied eyes found mine. “Felix and Charlie—”

“Have gone home, dear.” Mrs. Carson cut her off. Her dark eyes found mine, and she shooed me down the hallway. I nodded, turning and catapulting into a run. Still, though, I couldn't resist looking back. 

“Come on, miss Marley. You're usually so well behaved!” Mrs. Carson approached the girl, and I glimpsed her shadow bleeding across the wall. 

Something ice cold slithered down my spine. 

*Shadows that would haunt her, following her every move.* 

*Monsters who didn't eat. Worse. Monsters that  chew until there is nothing left to swallow.*

Marley backed away, trying to squirm out of the man’s grip. Mrs Carson smiled. 

“I've called your Mommy, and everything is going to be okay.” Marley started to protest, but the teacher was already walking away. “They're good kids,” she called over her shoulder. “I'll miss them.”

When Carson was gone, Marley started screaming. 

Instead of heading to the main entrance, the man dragged her through the fire door. 

“Shut up, you little *brat.*”

His voice felt like a knife slicing through me. 

*Monsters that use words, instead of gnashing teeth*. 

I stayed frozen until I forced myself to move. 

But I didn’t go to Mom, who waited in the parking lot.

I ran after the man, trailing him through the door as he picked Marley up and threw her, squirming, over his shoulder. 

He hauled the girl over to a white van. Marley screamed, her angry noises muffled by his hand. 

The man pulled up the shutters and dumped her inside, closing them before diving into the driver's seat. 

When the engine started up, I ran over, stood on my tiptoes, and yanked at the back doors until they burst open. Three faces blinked back at me. Charlie’s eyes were half-lidded, peering at me. Felix, grabbing hold of a sobbing Marley, stumbled to his feet.

“Thea?” he whimpered. 

I didn’t speak, my mouth dry, my gaze glued to sterile white light bathing their faces. I reached for Charlie’s hand, and he nodded, eyes wide, intertwining our fingers. 

“Don't let go,” he said, his voice strained. 

I nodded. “I won't.”

I helped him out. Felix grabbed Marley and dove out too, landing on the concrete with a cringe worthy smack. 

For a while, none of us spoke. We sat on the side of the road, slumped together.  

When Felix’s head thumped onto my shoulder, I forgot to flinch away. 

Marley was still crying, gasping for breath, the boys hugging her. 

I watched them, my tummy twisting. 

I jolted, remembering my mom was waiting. 

But something warm slammed into me, hard enough to drag the breath from my lungs. I didn’t realize it was Charlie until he sniffled against my shoulder, and I felt myself start to unravel too. His hug was comforting, his arms tucking me into his chest. “I’m sorry,” he whispered. 

“I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he sobbed, his shaking only easing when I gently nudged him. 

Felix joined the hug, pressing his weight into me, and then Marley hesitantly followed. 

Her smile was splintered, her eyes blossoming red, but for the first time in her life, Marley Eastbrook was really looking at me. “I now pronounce you our magical witch!” she said, giggling, gingerly placing her tiara on my head.

“No!” I shook my head. “I’m not a witch.”

Marley’s smile faded. “I’m sorry,” her eyes widened. “Our protector,” she corrected, swiping at her eyes. “Who is *not* a witch.”

That wasn't the first time I saved them. Nor will it be the last.

Monsters were coming for my classmates. My *friends.* 

—

In the fourth grade, we were in the park. There was a woman with no shadow stalking Felix while he played football. 

Marley was on the swings with Charlie, and I was keeping watch. 

I turned around for one second to take a bite of my candy bar. *One* second. *One* bite. I had been so careful. When I glanced back, the three of them were gone. 

Marley’s swing was eerily still.

After hours of searching, following people with either no shadows or far too many, a sharp thudding sound drew me to the trunk of our old janitor’s car. 

I found them.

Dumped between trash bags full of compost. 

The boys were unconscious, knocked out cold, while Marley was screaming.

She pretended to be unfazed, but she was shaking when I yanked her out.

Her eyes questioned me, but she never spoke. 

Never asked me *why* I was there. 

The boys followed, disoriented and stumbling over themselves after I splashed my water bottle on their faces. “We need to call the police,” Felix kept telling me, shoving his phone in my hands. 

I shook my head.

The one thing I have learned, is to never trust adults.

Marley smoothed down her shirt, fixed her tiara, and nodded at me. “Thanks, Thea.”

—

In seventh grade, they disappeared during a field trip to the aquarium. 

I found them tied up in an old factory nearby, kidnapped by a random old woman who kept saying, “I don't know why I did it.”

She even gave us popsicles as an apology.

I pretended (as always) not to see her second shadow.

Growing up, I had realized that every monster, human or otherwise, who tried to hurt them was either missing their shadow or had too many. I came to the same logical conclusion: “They're possessed.”

I thought the abductions would stop as we got older. 

But if anything, the older they got, the hungrier the monsters became. 

Shadows multiplied around them. 

But it wasn't just random people. There were *real* human monsters too. 

Junior year. They were spiked at a party. This time, by a whole group of kids missing their shadows. I dumped the spiked drinks for refills. 

Felix, drunk and none the wiser, glared at me over the rim of his (now safe) piña colada. 

“What the *fuck*, Thea?” Felix was already experimenting with his sexuality, hand in hand with the same guy who drugged his drink. Seventeen-year-old Felix Tiori had grown into an insufferable player who used his looks and social status as weapons.

Still a so-called “knight”, but now riddled with anxiety, yet conversely obsessed with himself. 

If Marley were to be dragged away, Felix Tiori would be too busy admiring his reflection or chasing something shiny.

Dressed in a button-down shirt with the collar popped and thick slicked back reddish hair, he *wanted* all eyes on him. I caught his red rimmed gaze, sometimes, frantically searching for *someone* to look at him. 

Unfortunately for my oblivious classmate, the only ones paying attention wanted to *kill* him. 

Leaning over the bar of some sleazy college kid whose name I didn’t know, Felix fixed me with a glare and downed his drink in one gulp. “I’m sorry, but I don’t think I remember *you* being invited, bro.”

I scowled into my soda. 

Asshole. 

I was sitting in the perfect vantage point. 

Behind me, Charlie Castle was destroying someone at Mario Kart.

So far, he was safe.

Through the sliding doors leading to the pool, Marley Eastbrook, still the class princess, slumped on a deck chair, phone in hand, sunglasses pinning back thick golden curls. Marley was the most popular person at the party, and she was *alone*. 

She had admirers, yes, but the only ones truly close to her were Felix and Charlie. 

And, by default…me.

According to ChatGPT, we were bound by trauma. 

A loud, explosive bang caught me off guard.

“Fuck you! That’s bullshit, you're *cheating!*”

Charlie was standing, seething, the game controller halfway across the room.

“You cheated!” he spluttered, gesturing at the TV. He turned to his opponent, and I was already getting to my feet. Charlie’s knight status was slippery. Yes, he would protect Marley, but by murdering her attacker. And then stamping on their face. 

Felix beat me to it. “Kaz.” He wore an easy smile, but his eyes were dark. A warning.

Felix was smiling, of course he was. But I could see his silent threat as clear as day. 

*”If you fuck this up for me, I will never fucking talk to you again, you fucking idiot.”*

Next to him, a previously lit cigarette ignited orange. 

Jeez, these monsters weren't playing around. 

Marley was already standing, her eyes glued to me. Head tilted, lips kissing her drink. Narrowed, but not suspicious. She too was wondering how I’d snuck into a college frat party. 

“Yoooo, take it easy, man.”

Charlie was like a dog. Loyal. 

He caught Marley’s scowl, his expression melting to one of a wounded puppy. 

The boy instantly slumped down, folding his arms, lips curled in a snarl. His tantrums were normal, so I ignored him. 

“But I was *winning*.”

Thankfully, the night only ended up with him vomiting on my shoes and drunkenly telling me to fuck off.

—

Senior prom. A random guy tried to strangle an extremely drunken (and drugged) Charlie. 

I whacked him over the head with a bottle of vodka. 

But it was during graduation, when I figured I'd lost them for good. 

I found them unconscious in the back of a stranger’s car. The engine was on, windows rolled up. Felix had no pulse. Charlie was slumped over, unmoving. I shook Marley awake, and she flinched away from me, her eyes half lidded. 

“Why?” she whispered, when I untied her wrists. Her voice was a shuddery breath, her frenzied gaze searching my eyes. “Why is it *always* you who saves us?”

“You.” Charlie slurred from the backseat, his head nestled on Felix’s shoulder. He was coming round. “It's *always* YOU.”

I avoided their eyes, those shimmering rings circling their pupils like glowing brands. Marks of territory. I started calling it the witch’s mark. Maybe I was one, after all. They had already been marked by every monster, human or otherwise. 

Everyone they met wanted them dead. 

Every shadow in the dark was already breathing down their necks. 

And it was all because of *me*.

I forced a grin, squeezing Marley’s hands. 

Swallowed my guilt.

I opened my mouth to reply, to tell them everything.

But I choked on them.

“Tell me.” Marley grabbed my hands, her fingernails digging in. “Why? Why you?”

“Because you're my friends,” I whispered.

Something shattered in her expression. Her hands slipped from mine, eyes narrowing. Marley came close. So close, spiked punch breath tickling my face.

“We’re not friends, Thea,” she said softly. Her voice was strangely gentle, like she was softening a blow. Marley held out her hand for my phone. “I'm calling the cops,” she said, tone laced with her old self. “Go home. Before I get a restraining order.”

“Fuckin’ stalker,” Felix groaned from the backseat. 

I obeyed the princess's order, handing over my phone and walking away. 

But I couldn't stay away from them. 

Then came college.

—

It was a quiet day. I was packing my things, getting ready to follow Marley to a party, when three sharp taps startled me out of my stupor. Mom was at work, and it’s not like I had any friends. I approached the front door with caution, eyeing my mother’s favorite red vase. Just in case. 

When I opened the door, Charlie was standing on the threshold. Out of everyone I might’ve expected, he was dead last.

Wearing a sweatshirt in ninety-degree heat was typical Charlie. Hood up, hair tucked away, arms full with two boxes of pizza.

He held up his hand in a shy wave. 

“Sooo, I wasn’t sure what kind you liked. I got tomato and cheese,” he said, frowning. 

“That’s, like, the classic. I also brought barbecue sauce in case you’re into that. Uh, you can use my Netflix if you want. It’s not technically mine. It’s my mom’s. But I use it.” He stepped forward, and I froze. Charlie didn’t know how to smile properly. 

Instead, he sort of grimaced as if in pain, like it was something he was still figuring out.

“Are you gonna let me in, or…?” he bowed his head, mumbling something. 

“What?” I whispered. 

He sighed, tipping his head back, eyes squeezed shut. “I *said* I'm maybe sorry, or whatever. I dunno, man, I don't know how to say sorry. I thought you liked pizza.”

I didn't respond. I was still processing Felix’s last words. 

*”Fucking stalker.”*

I found myself marching into my front yard, straight over to my Mom’s flowers. 

Charlie followed, a little hesitant. “I'm a little scared to ask you what you're doing.”

I crouched, digging in the dirt until I found what I was looking for. 

Charlie raised a brow when I dangled the worm in his face. 

“What?” his lips curved. “It's just a *worm*, Thea.”

Just a worm. 

It was just a worm, and yet I could still feel his younger self slamming my head against the wall, my vision swimming in stars. 

I still remembered his voice in my ear, his hands on my back before he pushed me into icy cold water. “If you tell any adults, you're *dead*,” he'd hissed. 

I remembered everything, while he was blissfully unaware.

Charlie disgusted me. Maybe I was right to accidentally curse him as a kid. 

I dropped the worm, pushed past him, and walked back inside, slamming the door in his face.

“Thea?” Charlie knocked again. “Wait, what's wrong?”

I ignored him, running upstairs to my room.

I was halfway to my door when a muffled cry startled me.

“Mmmphmmmm?” A familiar, stifled shriek sent my heart into a frenzy.

Felix.

I found my voice choking in my throat. “Felix?”

There was a loud BANG, which I guessed was him falling off the bed.

“Mmmphmm?!”

I figured that meant, “Thea?!”

When I was a kid, I could easily get my mom's door open to look for secret presents. I jammed a metal hair slide into the hole, shimmied it, and yanked it open.

I didn’t think. I just ran, stumbling into the room to find Marley and Felix tied back to back, gagged on the floor. My hands shook as I untied them, ripping the tape off their mouths. I wished I hadn’t.

“This was all you!?” Felix shrieked. I had to cover his mouth.

Marley was strangely quiet. 

“It’s not me,” I whispered, slowly removing my hand.

But I didn’t have time to explain.

Mom was in the doorway, surrounded by members of her book club.

Slumped over her shoulder was an unconscious Felix.

Mom’s glare found me.

“Ten years,” she said coldly, letting Charlie collapse in a crumpled heap. Behind me, Felix stumbled back, Marley clutched tightly in his arms. “Ten years,” Mom repeated, her voice trembling with rage.

A few months ago I started seeing a wonderful person, ""Francois"" (35NB) who's in a triad with ""Cloud"" (33NB) and ""Hannah"" (34F). Those two live about an hour away and they've been a triad for 5-6 years. I met Cloud and Hannah for the first time this weekend and we spent the night at their house.

I had soooooooo much anticipatory anxiety. I was afraid that I would lose my shit if I saw someone else kissing my partner. I thought I'd feel it like a bullet to the heart if they told someone else ""I love you"" in my presence. I feared that the metas would be a combination of the most toxic traits I've encountered over the years... passive-aggressive, subtly cutting, purposefully making references to things I have no clue about, possessive little touches, condescending questions. Like I'm the new kid at the cafeteria and I have nowhere to sit.

Y'all, it was... astonishingly peaceful. My metas were warm and welcoming. Cloud insisted on taking the sofa so Francois and I could share Cloud's bed. We shared coffee and toast in the morning (literal KTP!). We took unhurried, meandering nature walks and pointed out frogs, ducks, and flowers to one another. Then while Cloud and Hannah rested, Francois and I prepared a vegan supper and did their dishes and cleaned their bathroom.

After dinner, we all snuggled in Hannah's bed, talking softly. Francois kissed me and then turned over to kiss Hannah and Cloud. Cloud and I toyed with each other's hands while we were both holding Francois' side. Both Francois and I had moments where we were struck speechless and crying by how extraordinarily fortunate and loved we felt in that moment.

I know it won't always be like this. I don't think polyamory is the answer to everyone's everything. I don't know if I myself am poly (but I do, with Francois' encouragement, have a date lined up in two weeks!). But after escaping the most emotionally and physically abusive relationship of my life this winter, I was so grateful to be part of my loved one's love this weekend.

I went off after 4 weeks without a taper. (Stomach pain was gone but I had horrible side effects and couldn’t handle it anymore- definitely a self induced problem) Ever since getting off I had new heart burn that I’d never had before being on the medication. Preciously it was only stomach pain with no symptoms of reflux. The pain was so bad I’d be stuck in bed some days. 3 weeks in and I am seeing decent improvement. I’ve even eaten tomatoes but haven’t been able to quite tolerate my normal diet. Definitely can’t do coffee or anything fried yet. I’m just wondering if this pain will go away? 

For a bit of background after starting a migraine medication I did have GERD symptoms (only dysphasia) and was diagnosed but after stopping that medication the symptoms went away entirely. I didn’t have any trouble and every test came up clear. Now I’m having symptoms of acid in my throat, pain in my chest and shoulder, and runny nose. I’ve seen only minor improvement and it never fully goes away even with Pepcid and gaviscon. I know that rebound is a thing but should it be lasting this long? I’m very sensitive to most medication so it’s not abnormal for me to get the worst of the side effects if this is rebound. My doctor just says ‘let’s see how it is in 6 weeks’ and then canceled my egd because the stomach pain is gone. When I message them they just say it’s anxiety- I even went back on my antidepressants to see if it would help my symptoms like they said because I definitely do have anxiety but it didn’t help.

This Mercury Retrograde is wild. I never talked to you about how into astrology and spirituality I am. But I’m really feeling it recently. All I can think about is telling you how I feel. Well are both air signs so we’ll both be feeling it in some way. 

Hence these letters. I am craving to reach out to you, but I know with me still working across the road, it’s not right. I need to leave there and then I can reach out to you. 

But I’m tired of thinking about you, tired of thinking how you’re going to react. Tired of talking about you to my friends. They all say I should just tell you how I feel. Well, I am in a way. I’m putting it into the universe. 

I don’t want to be an avoidant anymore. 
I want to tell you everything, I want to hear your everything. I want to know what it’s like to fall asleep in your arms. I want to know what it’s like to hear you sigh in the darkness as we cuddle and fall asleep.  

I want to bring you coffee when you’re tired. Cook your favourite foods. Help you with work stuff. Run you a bath after your training. I could go on, but for all the pain I’ve given you, I want to bring joy tenfold. 

I really hope I get to follow this all through one day.

## Key Features Analysis

The best white tea candles stand out due to their carefully selected ingredients, masterfully blended fragrances, burn time, and overall aesthetic appeal.

**Scent Profile:** A premium white tea candle features a complex and nuanced scent profile that extends beyond a simple ""tea"" fragrance. Expect subtle notes of citrus, floral accents like jasmine or bergamot, and a grounding base of woods or musk. The layering of scents should create a harmonious and balanced aroma that evolves over time.

**Wax Composition:** The wax used in a candle considerably impacts its burn quality and scent throw.Soy wax, beeswax, and coconut wax are all popular choices prized for their clean burning properties and ability to hold fragrance effectively. Paraffin wax, while more affordable, can release harmful chemicals when burned and frequently enough produces a weaker scent. High-quality waxes ensure a longer, cleaner, and more fragrant burn.

**Wick material:** The wick plays a crucial role in the candle's performance. Cotton wicks are commonly used, but some candles now feature wooden wicks that produce a gentle crackling sound reminiscent of a fireplace. The wick should be appropriately sized for the candle diameter to ensure an even burn and prevent tunneling or excessive smoking. A well-chosen wick optimizes scent diffusion and minimizes soot production.

**Burn time and Throw:** A top-tier white tea candle offers a generous burn time,allowing you to enjoy its fragrance for extended periods. Burn time depends on the size of the candle, the wax used, and the wick type, but generally, expect anywhere from 40 to 80 hours for a larger candle. Scent throw refers to the candle's ability to fill a room with its fragrance. A strong scent throw ensures that the aroma is noticeable without being overwhelming, creating a pleasant and inviting ambiance.**Container Material and Design:** The container not only holds the candle but also contributes to its overall aesthetic. Glass jars, ceramic vessels, and tin cans are common choices, each offering a different look and feel. The design should be both functional and visually appealing, complementing the candle's scent and adding to the décor of your space. A well-designed container is heat-resistant, durable, and aesthetically pleasing.

## Core Benefits

White tea candles offer a multitude of benefits beyond their pleasant aroma.

**Mood Enhancement:** The subtle and calming scent of white tea is ideal for promoting relaxation and reducing stress. Its delicate fragrance helps to create a serene and peaceful atmosphere, perfect for unwinding after a long day or creating a calming ambiance for meditation and yoga. The gentle aroma can also ease anxiety and improve overall mood.

**Air Freshening:** White tea candles effectively neutralize unwanted odors,leaving your space smelling clean and fresh. Unlike synthetic air fresheners that simply mask odors, white tea candles can subtly disinfect the air, leaving a clean, pure scent. They are especially useful in areas prone to lingering odors,such as kitchens or bathrooms.

**Improved Focus and Concentration:** The subtle and refreshing notes in white tea candles can enhance focus and concentration. The gentle aroma stimulates the senses without being overpowering, creating an environment conducive to productivity and creativity. This makes them ideal for use in home offices or study spaces.

**Elegant Home Décor:** White tea candles serve as stylish decorative accents, enhancing the décor of any room. The sleek and sophisticated design of many candles adds a touch of elegance to bookshelves, coffee tables, and countertops. Available in a variety of sizes, shapes, and materials, they blend effortlessly with any interior design style.

1mgy9g9,https://www.reddit.com/r/varicocele/comments/1mgy9g9/advice_needed_starting_classes_soon_and_dont_know/,"Advice needed, starting classes soon and don't know what to do or think","I know this is a very long read, I just hope someone can read every detail, I've been going through so much stress because of this and fortunately only chatgpt has helped me in looking for an answer, even though either specialists or my family (I'm alone in this, they're clueless) have failed in giving me hope and an answer.

Hey, so I'm 24, and I'm asking for advice or any kind of help on this. Basically, a month ago I started having problems in my groin area, I've been on summer break so I spent most of my time playing guitar in classical position, noticed after 6 or 8 hours when I finished my sessions, my groin hurt. 3 years ago I had an incident, worked out too much and injured my groin, thought it was an inguinal hernia, but since there was no visible bulge couldn't undergo surgery, so I thought this time it was the same thing, a superficial hernia that would go away if I rested for a couple of weeks. This time though the pain was way more intense and sharp, and it started in my left testicle, I really couldn't walk at all, had to use a crutch to support my weight, as I felt that my intestines were protruding underneath, and also felt like my testicles were heavy. Sometimes when brushing my teeth or taking a bath I felt as though the left testicle was moving upward to the left side. I also developed two bulges in both the left and right side of the testicles, that would protrude more and less, that's why I thought it was an hernia. Just lately the most noticeable symptom is like a bag of worms when I got back to bed after going downstairs or going to the bathroom, and I always thought it was the intestines going back after putting pressure. So I rested for a couple weeks and decided to go to a doctor (at first I couldn't stand up or sit at all, so even a trip in car would have been extremely excruciating, couldn't even walk a block away), did two ultrasounds, one for bilateral inguinal hernia and the other for testicles, but they didn't find anything out of the ordinary. It wasn't a doppler or anything like that, just two ordinary ultrasounds. So I went to a doctor, ruled out hernia, then to a surgeon specialized in hernias and all, had my parts examined and he literally told me there was nothing for him to fix, to look for either a urologist, plastic surgeon or neurologist. What I found extremely frustrating is, once I got up and walked after a few minutes, the pain would go away. The surgeon suggested the side bulges might be due to me losing weight years ago, they became fat deposits or something like that, and my testicles were displaced, as they had been up for most of this time. I've also noticed that erections make things way worse, the other day I woke up and had been trying so hard not to have erections (even though I did), then went to the bathroom and saw a huge vein in the bottom of my left testicle, never noticed something like that before, and it did hurt. Right now I've been experiencing a lot of improvement, I can walk, the day I went to the surgeon I spent around three hours in walking, sitting in bus (it was somewhat uncomfortable, but very manageable) and waiting in the wait room for about an hour, just today I made another test, went downstairs to get some coffee and went back to my room, just felt a little tingling sensation, the usual bag of worms that you would feel with varicocele. Since the hernia has been ruled out, I've been thinking I might have this. Problem is, in three days I'm supposed to register for next semester, fortunately I don't have to pay due to a scholarship, and in a week  and a half or so I'll be starting classes. Right now I can walk normally for the most part, I've been getting progressively way better, but I'm still scared of sitting, have been in bed for the last month, I tried to sit today in my chair, but was scared and got up in 10 secs, it didn't hurt or anything, but the pressure I feel immediately makes me really scared to hurt myself so far. I took a taxi the other day (when I went for the surgeon appointment) and it was fine, more cushy and there was more legroom, but I'm afraid even if I can go through sitting in buses (or standing, if there's too many people), that chairs in school will be uncomfortable to be sitting for about 6 or 8 hours. I'll be honest, right now so much money has been spent there is no way I can afford to do anything, what with the bills, my sibling paying for school's next semester, it's a huge mess and I can't work or anything. I seriously don't wanna miss this semester (been considering this like crazy), not only because of my classmates, but we were working with a teacher for social services, and there has been an opportunity to work on a project which will most likely help with internship, and it will be paid too. If I could make money appear out of thin air, I'd go for another consult (they're expensive btw), I will most likely not even be able to afford transportation for school, anyways I'm digressing. I've been reading that many people deal with this even with pain or discomfort, and I know only going through several consults with specialists doctors, and spending a lot of money just in that, will I find an actual solution, but I just wanna hear if anyone has any advice on how to deal with this, or if I should try to enroll for classes, then if something happens, maybe I can ask for school medical insurance to help with leave of absence, that would mean enrolling first, going a couple classes, and then ask for help, so that insurance can go through. I seriously have no idea what will happen, there is so much uncertainty in this, I'm losing my mind. ",1,1754264706.0,varicocele,1,1.0,False

I’m a pretty easygoing 30 year old guy who’s just as down for spontaneous adventures as I am for a laid-back night in with good food and better company. I'm 6’0"", white, blonde (yep, like my username), wear glasses, usually clean-shaven but giving the summer beard experiment a go right now. Physically active and in solid shape at 195 lbs—happy to swap pics once we’re chatting.

When I’m not chasing sunbeams or iced coffee, I’m usually planning my next trip. Travel has been a big part of my life lately, and I’ve got some exciting plans lined up for Asia and Europe next year. I also want to check out more of the West Coast and Midwest.

Live music is a big love of mine. Whether it’s a packed venue or an outdoor summer show, I’m always down to see a band I love. My playlists bounce around from alt rock to electro to indie, but I'm open to almost anything—even country if you've got the right track to convert me. Oh, and I’ve been learning salsa… slowly. Let’s just say I’ve got the enthusiasm down, the steps are a work in progress

Outside of that, I’m a big fan of manga, the occasional anime, and I’m deep into board games and indie video games. Slay the Spire, Hades, and Fallout: New Vegas are my current favorites. I also like cooking (especially seasonal recipes), baking, dancing, a bit of swimming and being cozy.

If any of that sounds like your kind of energy, I’d love to hear from you. Looking to connect with someone 24+ preferably on the East Coast—but if you're elsewhere in the US and we click, I’m open to seeing where it goes.

Y’know, all the typical Mormon stuff. I didn’t really ever have a testimony, haven’t even bothered to read the BOM because frankly I just don’t care. I don’t need to do a deep dive to realize the church isn’t true because like… duh. I just never really bought into the whole another testament, anti coffee god and whatever other weird stuff is believed. Never believed in Santa Claus growing up no matter how hard my parents tried to convince me, and never believed in the church either lol. 
Anyways my question is, is it possible to remove my name or records without anybody in my family knowing? I’m just tired of the ministering sisters and the countless emails. It’s just pretty annoying at this point but my husbands family and my family are still very active and devout members. I don’t want to make a big deal out of all of it, but I really don’t want anymore surprise visits from the “ward family”. 
I’ve heard of quitmormon.org but have heard mixed opinions, and it just brings me back to the same question of will they be alerting my family or something like that? I feel like my mom’s small glimmer of hope in life is that I’ll be with her forever in celestial glory, but to be honest I don’t want to go to any of the testicle kingdoms lmaoo! 
Oh also, i OBVIOUSLY don’t have an active temple recommend and also didn’t get married in the temple (i was pregnant when i got married, oops). I did do baptisms for the dead a couple times when I was like 14 I think. Anyways, as you can probably tell I’m pretty clueless about this whole thing, like I said it’s not my thing. Just wanted to throw that in there in case it matters, just looking for advice. thanks!

We were very much in love and everything went pretty much perfectly until she left for a summer abroad. I’m not much older but I did a lot early, so I had just finished college while she was starting it. As a result, we were living more like adults than college kids. When she spent the time away, she realized that she had been missing out on a bunch of “college stuff” and she broke up with me. It was devastating, and I couldn’t understand why we shouldn’t be able to figure things out.

I never initiated conversation after she got back and moved her stuff out of my apartment. All the same, she found a reason to text me once a month. After 6 months apart, she called me to tell me that she missed me, and asked if we could talk in a month when the semester started. We met for coffee and she said that when she had called me, she wanted to get back together, but now that she had had time to think about it, she had a gut feeling that it wasn’t the right time. Understandably, this was crushing. She talked about how badly she wanted to make things work but how it just didn’t feel right. I was cordial and understanding. After all, I want her to be happy, and I also want to be with someone who wants to be with me. All the same, I was crushed. It would be one thing if she just didn’t want to get back together, but SHE reached out to ME. 

We’re talking again in a few days and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t think she’s vindictive and I don’t believe she’s a bad person. This was a thoughtless thing to do but I don’t know what to think. She doesn’t want to ask me to wait for her but she thinks she’ll be ready eventually. I know my friends hate her for it and think I should cut her off but it doesn’t feel that simple.

It hurts so bad to know that we both want to be together but she just can’t do it for some reason. What can I possibly say to figure this out or untangle things? I don’t want to “convince” someone to date me but I can’t tell if she’s lost or confused or something else.

Jr, the Troublemakers, Boomer, and Deema through the facetime camera watching Butch and Brick arm wrestling, Electro. Jr, Hydro. Jr, Snowflake, Mili, and Goby are playing Super Smash Each Other in the Ass Bros, Purp. Jr and Gil were talking to eachother, Tox. Jr and Orange were watching and laughing at the Wonderfully Weird World of Gumball, Rox. Jr and Oona are sharing a lunch with eachother, Ariela. Jr, Charcoal and Nonny are reading a book.

""Man everyone else has already formed a strong bonds "" Dusk thought to himself looking at a mermaid sitting by herself at lunch, she had a blue tail and bikini and had straight pink hair ""*sighs* Everyone except me, I want to ask Molly out before the school dance starts, but I can't, all because of her"" Dusk gave an ugly look at his sister

Turns out Dusk has asked this girl to hang out before but his sister Dawn had plans to sabotage each and everyone of them. She either embarrassed him by showing Molly embarrassing photos and secrets of him, making farting noises or just walking away.

Dawn then noticed her brother looking at someone and a lightbulb formed in her head

""Say I noticed you looking at that girl over there"" Dawn said with a slight grin

""Huh, yeah, can I just ask her to sit with us WITHOUT you sabotaging it"" Dusk said

""Pfft, when have I ever done that heh-heh"" Dawn asked

""*sigh* Do we really need to go through that montage again?"" Dusk asked

""Alright, alright, I'm just messing with you"" Dawn said putting her arm around Dusk ""I've had my fun for now, now it's your time to shine""

Dawn got up and floated towards Molly, and Dusk tapped her shoulder

""Yeah"" Molly said turning to him

""Hey, I've been wondering if you'd like to sit with u-"" As Dusk was about to finish his sentence, Dawn punched right through Dusk hitting Molly right in the nose

""AAAHH! WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!?"" Molly asked as her nose began to bleed

""WAIT THAT WASN'T ME THAT WAS MY SISTER DAWN!"" Dusk tried to explain

""THAT'S ALWAYS YOU'RE EXCUSE!"" Molly yelled at Dusk ""I'm going to the nurse""

As Molly left, Dawn broke out in laughter

""PFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFTTT HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! YOU REALLY THINK ANYONE WAS GOING TO SIT WITH YOU! YOU FREAK"" Dawn said

""Every time I try to be with her, she sabotages it"" Dusk thought to himself turning into a fist ""Well, I'VE HAD ENOUGH!""

While Dawn was laughing her leaf off, Dusk managed to turn into a fist and launch himself at Dawn at full force knocking the two on top of the table

""HEY WHAT WAS THAT FOR!?"" Dawn asked

""Oh I don't know"" Dusk yelled ""Maybe it cause EVERYTIME I SOMETHING GOOD IS HAPPENING TO ME YOU SABOTAGE IT LIKE THE LISA YOU ARE!""

""WELL THIS LISA IS GOING TO KICK YOUR ASS!"" Dawn yelled

The two siblings began to fight each other

""Oh seriously, why can't these two get along?"" Purp. Jr said face palming herself noticing Electro. Jr and Snowflake holding up cash

""I'VE GOT 5 BUCKS ON DUSK!"" Snowflake said ""He's been taking Dawn's shit the second they were born, it was only a matter of time before he snapped""

""I've got 20 bucks on Dusk"" Electro. Jr said ""He can spread himself all over Dawn's body and use her attacks against herself""

Dusk covered his body all over Dawn and summoned fists from the shadows and started striking Dawn

""SNOWFLAKE! ELECTRO. JR! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!"" Purp. Jr said trying to stop the two from fighting but gets knocked back

""You okay Purp?"" Gil asked catching her

""I've been better"" Purp. Jr said still shaken by their attacks

""STOP HITTING YOURSELF! STOP HITTING YOURSELF! STOP HITTING YOURSELF!"" Dusk said mocking before getting strangled by a shadow clone of Dawn ""ACK!""

""WHY YOU LITTLE!"" Dawn said strangling his brother

Suddenly a crowd of students formed around the table with multiple students holding up cash

""FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!"" the crowd chanted

""My money's on the ghost girl"" someone said ""She's the Elemental Guardian of Shadow for goodness sakes, she can easily beat that blob on her back""

""My money's on the robo-boy"" another student said ""As that blob is kicking her ass""

We then cut to a door in the hallway with the words School Counselor Office printed on it and a voice can be heard of it, inside is Frost across the counselor Foghorn Leghorn

""Boy I say boy you gotta stop pullin these pranks of yours ya here."" Foghorn Leghorn scolded Frost

""But I make sure they aren't fatal all the time"" Frost defended himself

""Well I say I say how do you explain Mrs. Roth ended up with a severe concussion."" Foghorn Leghorn said

""I don't know"" Frost said

""I say I say boy if you don't stop pulling these deadly pranks I'm going to have to hold you back a grade"" Foghorn Leghorn said before noticing Frost rolling his eyes ""PAY ATTENTION WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU BOY! You may go now but hold off on these pranks of yours""

As Frost left the office, he noticed Dusk and Dawn sitting on a chair next to the door but went past them without saying a word

""Dusk and Dawn, the counselor will see you two now"" a TF2 heavy at the desk said

As Dusk and Dawn went into Foghorn's office, he sighed and facepalmed himself

""Well well well. I say I say if it isn't Dusk and Dawn, this the twentieth time I've seen you in my office this week. And I say I say it's not even Tuesday"" Foghorn told the two siblings ""What did you two do this time""

""I just pulled a small prank on my brother trying to ask a girl out"" Dawn said

""I may add, that small prank MADE A GIRL'S NOSE BLEED!"" Dusk angrily shouted at his sister

""Oh grow up, it's not like she was gonna say yes"" Dawn said

""WHY YOU LITTLE!"" Dusk said possessing and upgrading a nearby rope and started to strangle Dawn

""Ack-hahahaha-ack"" Dawn said

""I SAY I SAY THAT'S ENOUGH"" Foghorn said slamming his hands on the table and stood up ""YOU TWO HAVE PUSHED OVER THE LIMIT I SAY! THE STUDENTS ARE GETTING DISTRACTED AND BETTING MONEY ON YOUR WWE BRAWLS! I SAY I SAY YOU TWO ARE SUSPENDED UNTIL YOU BOTH LEARN TO GET ALONG! I'M CALLING YOUR PARENTS ABOUT ALL THIS!""

After the school day ends the two siblings went out in front and up to the other elemental guardians were waiting

""By the way this all your fault"" Dusk said

""That's quite a sentence you just said"" Dawn said putting on sunglasses ""Too bad I didn't listen

""Oh geez"" Tox. Jr said ""These two getting along with each other is a rare as finding a reboot that's actually well written""

""Anyways I'll be going now, see you guys tomorrow"" Nonny said waving goodbye to them

""Are you sure you're okay walking home by yourself?"" Charcoal asked

""Don't worry, I've been doing it since kindergarten"" Nonny explained ""It's not a far walk too""

""So anyway, with the school dance coming up"" Purp. Jr said ""You guys planning on going with anyone?""

""I'm going with Deema"" Steve. Jr said as he and Deema went up to the others

""Electro. Jr, do you want to come with me?"" Goby asked staring at Electro. Jr

""I guess I can free up a bit of my schedule for the dance"" Electro. Jr said

""I'm thinking of going with Geo"" Tox. Jr said

""HMMM MHHHMMMMM HMMM"" Rox. Jr said

""RJ's planning on going with Oona"" Hydro. Jr translated

""AWWW! Of course I want to go with you to the dance"" Oona said hugging Rox. Jr causing him to blush like crazy

""I'm thinking of asking Nonny to the dance"" Ariela. Jr said

Snowflake noticed Mili walking up to Umicar

""Mili"" Snowflake said getting down on one knee catching Mili's attention

""Woah woah woah, aren't you a bit too young for this?"" Goby asked

""Will you go to the school dance with me?"" Snowflake asked

""Aww, of course I'll go with you"" Mili answered

""Hey Purp. Jr"" Gil tapped Purp. Jr's shoulder ""You want to go to the school dance with me?""

""I-uh, I-uh, DON'T KNOW HOW TO ANSWER!"" Purp. Jr said as she fell on the ground blushing

""C'mon, it might be fun"" Gil said

""I guess so"" Purp. Jr responded getting up

""Me, Frost and Charcoal are going because we'd be told there be free food"" Hydro. Jr said

""It's a perfect reason to be there"" Frost said while Charcoal nodded

""Say Dusk, Dawn, you planning on going to the dance?"" Deema asked ""And with anyone?""

""I-"" Dusk was going to say something while Dawn interrupted him

""We're not going"" Dawn said

""WHAT!"" Deema responded as Dusk grabbed Dawn's hands and held them back

""I want to go with Molly, but Dawn keeps sabotaging my chances to ask her to sit together"" Dusk said while Dawn socked him in the face

""EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" Deema and Oona yelled like fangirls

""Hey everyone what's going on?"" Molly asked going up to the two holding a tissue up at her nose

""OH MY GOSH"" Deema said rushing up to Molly ""What happened girl! TELL ME!""

""I just got a hard blow to the nose when Dusk was talking to me, but he said it was his sister, but I doubt it, as he always says that"" Molly explained ""Anyway my rides here, see you guys

After a while, we see Dusk and Dawn sitting on a couch with Lunar and Samantha sitting across them on chairs. Samantha was fuming while Lunar just had a serious look

""I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TWO GOT SUSPENDED FOR FIGHTING LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW! AGAIN!"" Samantha yelled at the two ""WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME!?""

""Do you want to here the truth or Dawn's side of the story"" Dusk said before Dawn slapped him

""SHUT IT YOU SEAMEN PUKING ASSHOLE DICKHEAD"" Dawn yelled

""Oh geez, I think they overheard us watching South Park again"" Lunar said ""*sigh* Dusk, what happened""

""Well there is the girl at school I like named Molly, and with the school dance coming up, I want to ask her out before it's two late"" Dusk explained ""I've asked her to hang out before but Dawn kept sabotaging my attempts, but this time she-""

""WHO CARES!"" Dawn yelled before Lunar put his hand over her hand

""Let Dusk finish his side of the story, got it"" Lunar said while Dawn just nodded

""As I was saying, this time Dawn went to far and used her shadow powers to phase through my body and hit Molly right in the nose causing her nose to bleed"" Dusk explained

""Dawn, is this true?"" Lunar asked putting his hand away

""No it was just a small prank and Dusk was overreacting"" Dawn said

""Dawn, although nose bleeds aren't dangerous, you could've seriously injured her or even worse, killed her"" Lunar said

""Pfft, how?"" Dawn said with a smirk

""Cause shadow is a more danger element, it can allow you to produce shadow clones, create weapons or extensions of your body and even phase through solid objects. But if you're not careful, you can take the life of those you hold dear too"" Lunar said ""And you'll never reach your full potential""

""Since when is anyone close to Dawn, she constantly thinks she's above others all thanks to her powers"" Dusk stated

""For once you say something I agree with"" Dawn said

""Oh geez, honey, you got any ideas how to humble Dawn?"" Lunar asked Samantha

""Hm, I think I know a way"" Samantha said calming down her fury

Samantha got up and walked up to the fridge and pulled out a bowl of instant noodles and prepped

""Hey Dawn, you want this bowl of noodles. I know it's your favourite"" Samantha said while Dawn's mouth was drooling

""ARE YOU KIDDING ME! AFTER ALL THIS TIME YOU'RE REWARDING DAWN FOR HER BAD BEHAVIOUR!"" Dusk said in protest

""Hold up Dusk, let her cook"" Lunar told his son

""YEAH!"" Dawn said

""Well too bad"" Samantha said dropping the bowls of noodles on the floor

""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS!"" Dawn said with tears in her eyes while Purp just appeared out of nowhere and dove at the noodles devouring every last bit of it

""Cause that was how you treated your brother Bawn, taking every opportunity of happiness away from him"" Samantha explained to her daughter ""And Purp, what was that?""

""The five second rule"" Purp said getting in a chivalrous posed ""It is the universal rule I live by, to eat any food on the floor in five seconds or less, after that, it is gone forever""

""Anyway, now you know how your brother feels like by the way you treat him, hopefully you'd both get along better"" Samantha said

Dawn turned to Dusk and spoke quietly ""Dusk, I-I'm sorry""

""What was that, I couldn't hear you over you're ego the size of Matt and Trey's balls"" Dusk said forming an ear and putting a hand over it

""I'm sorry okay"" Dawn said louder

""MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS DAY THE NANOSECOND I WAS BORN!"" Dusk said pulling out a tape recorder and played it

""I'm sorry okay"" it was a recording of Dawn's voice

""MMMMMMMMMMMM, IT FEELS SO GOOD!"" Dusk said

""Wait, did you say Dawn's ego is the size of Matt and Trey's balls?"" Lunar asked

""OH GOD THEY OVERHEARD US WATCHING THE TRUMP EPISODE!"" Samantha said putting her hands below her eye

We cut to the day before the dance and we see Dusk, Dawn and the other kids standing in front of the school with their parents talking to Foghorn Leghorn

""Now, are you two sure they aren't gonna try to kill each other?"" Foghorn asked ""Cause I'll say I'll say you both will be in a lot of trouble if they fight each other""

""Don't worry, they'll be fine"" Lunar told Foghorn

""Well I'll take you're word for it"" Foghorn said coming up to the children ""C'mon kids, get to class, well I hope they made up, cause that'll really lighten my workload""

After the first class of the day is done, an announcement can be overheard on the P.A. system

""Friendly reminder everyone that the school dance is tomorrow. So if you hadn't asked out the special person to the dance, better do it before it's too late

""Oh yeah, Dusk"" Dawn said getting his brother's attention and pointing at Molly ""You never asked Molly out, so how would you feel like doing it now""

""Finally thank the stars"" Dusk said

The two floated towards Molly and Dusk tapped her shoulder

""Huh"" Molly said turning around before going from confused to disappointed ""Oh it's you, here to blame your sister again""

""Look, he wasn't lying about me causing all of those moments"" Dawn explained ""But I just want to say, sorry for making you're nose bleed""

""Yeah, and Molly, would you go to the school dance with me tomorrow"" Dusk asked grabbing her hands

""No"" Molly said breaking Dusk's heart ""How should I know this isn't some sick joke you two are gonna pull and break my tail""

The bell rings and Molly goes to class leaving Dusk frozen in shock with his colour draining right out of him into a puddle

""Oh geez, don't worry bro, there's plenty of other fish in the ocean"" Dawn said wrapping her arm around Dusk ""You'll meet the perfect girl for you some day""

The rest of the day goes by and we see Dusk and Dawn enter the Mario Mobile with Lunar driving

""Hey you two, how was school?"" Lunar asked

""Terrible"" Dusk answered looking down

""Molly rejected him as she thought it was gonna be another prank"" Dawn explained

""Well, all I gotta say is that one day you're gonna meet the perfect girl for you"" Lunar said

""I think I'll take Dusk out for a walk later today to take his mind off Molly"" Dawn said

""Alright just be back before midnight"" Lunar said while Dawn nodded in agreement

Later that night, we see Dusk and Dawn going out for a stroll

""I can't believe it, she was the love of my life, and she took my heart, and shattered it into a million pieces"" Dusk said

""Oh geez, I can't believe this"" Dawn said annoyed ""Look here buddy, for the few days we've been getting along, I noticed that you're a great guy, and if Molly doesn't see this, she doesn't deserve you""

Dawn took a look at a nearby clock

""Oh it's 10:30 PM, we'd better be heading back"" Dawn said heading up to a street crossing

As the two looked both ways and began to cross, a light began to head towards them

""What is that li- OH SHIT IT'S A VEHICLE! RUN!"" Dawn said as the two began to dash off

After a while, the two began to wake up in a white light

""What the, aw man I can't believe it we died, Dusk wake up"" Dawn said shaking Dusk

""Oh geez, is this heaven"" Dusk said

""No it's not"" A voice was heard startling

""WHO IS IT"" Dawn said trying to make shadow weapons but fails ""Geez with so much light there's no shadow to harness from""

""God, is that you?"" Dusk asked

""No, I'm not a deity or anything, I'm just a guest star for a dance at this school called Cartoon Academy"" the voice explained

As the light cleared, the two could see clearly where the voice came from. Standing in front of them was a mermaid with a black bikini and tail with a star pattern on it, and she had a black braided hairstyle

""Oh no fucking way"" Dawn said pointing at her ""It's-""

""STYLEE!"" Dusk said rushing to the popstar grabbing her hands ""I AM A HUGE FAN OF YOU'RE MUSIC ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SUNG WITH MOLLY!""

""Well it's nice to meet a fan"" Stylee said putting Dusk's hands down ""And I'm sorry for nearly running you over, my van recently became a self driving vehicle and it's still running through the prototype phase. Anyway I want to ask you two a question, what are two kids like you two doing out here this late?""

""Well, I've been trying to clear my mind after I've been rejected to go with a girl to the dance, because she thought I was gonna 'prank' her again"" Dusk said

""Well what is this girl like?"" Stylee asked

""Well she has pink hair, a blue bikini and tail and has slightly brown skin tone"" Dusk said ""And her name is Molly""

""Well it seems like this girl you want to ask out is the same one that I sung with"" Stylee explained ""She helped me realize that I should dress the way I want to look, not the way everyone else wants me to look. But why did she thought you would 'prank' her again?""

""Well, ever since the year started, I've been trying to ask her to hang out and even ask her out to the dance but my sister kept sabotaging my attempts, even punching through me giving her a nose bleed"" Dusk explained ""Even though we reconciled, she still doesn't believe it""

""Well the best advice I can give is that you can't just say you two made up, you gotta prove it"" Stylee said before getting an idea ""Say how would you two like to receive my help to help prove to Molly you both made up""

Dawn looked at a clock inside the bus and her eyes widened

""You think you can also give us a ride home? We were supposed to be back before midnight and it's 11:40"" Dawn asked ""But I agree to the plan, it's the least I could do to make up to Dusk

""Why sure, what is your address?"" Stylee asked

""You know the showgrounds owned by SMG4?"" Dusk asked

""Yeah I do"" Stylee said ""I here some crazy stuff goes off on there""

""We live nearby so you could drop us off there"" Dusk explained

""Alright"" Stylee went up to the front and began to type in the AI ""Destination, SMG4 showgrounds, it should be about a 10 minute ride kids""

As the van reached it's destination to the showground, Dusk and Dawn went outside the van, as the were about to head home, Stylee tells them

""Okay remember the plan you two, meet me tomorrow backstage of Cartoon Academy, and Dusk, I need you to right lyrics for a song"" Stylee said

""You got it"" Dusk and Dawn said in unison

""We gotta book it, we got 30 seconds left till midnight"" Dawn said before she and Dusk dashed off inside the onion landing on the couch next to Lunar

""Really cutting it close you two"" Lunar said ""What took you so long""

""There was heavy traffic"" Dawn responded

""Now get some rest you two, me, Electro, and Mario volunteered to manage lights at the school dance"" Lunar said ""Well, Mario volunteered when he'd be told there'd be free spaghetti if he volunteered. So we got a big day you two""

On the day of the dance we see Molly sitting alone at a table with a chocolate milkshake and Gil and Purp. Jr took notice

""C'mon Gil, let's help Molly out"" Purp. Jr said ""I'm sure her Gilly can make her feel better""

""Yeah good idea"" Gil said

The two sat down at Molly's table and Molly took notice to the two

""What do you two want?"" Molly asked

""We came here to ask you what's wrong"" Purp. Jr said ""So what's wrong?""

""Look, I just feeling like fish out of water with the way how I'm the only one here without a date"" Molly explained ""Well, except for those three"" Molly pointed to Frost, Charcoal, and Hydro. Jr stacked up on top of each other in front of the door

""C'mon you two, do you want to see what they have for desert or not"" Charcoal told the two below him

""C'mon it's harder than it looks carrying your body weight when you're body's made of clay"" Hydro. Jr explained

""Yeah cut us some slack bro"" Frost said

""Molly look, just because you don't have a date to the dance, doesn't mean it's a bad thing, anything can make someone happy, so what makes you happy"" Gil asked

""Well Gilly, what makes me happy is singing"" Molly answered the question

""Well, in a a minutes or two, you can volunteer to sing up on stage with a famous celebrity"" Gil told her ""I don't know who though""

""Aww, thanks Gilly"" Molly said hugging Gil ""You wanna stay here and catch up, I haven't been able to talk with you for a while now""

We then come back stage to see Stylee waiting impatiently

""C'mon c'mon, where are those two?"" Stylee said pacing back and forth, until Dawn and Dusk surprise her ""Ah, where'd you two come from?""

""You see, one of the powers of the Elemental Guardian of Shadow is that you can phase through shadows like a ghost"" Dawn explained

""Alright here's the lyrics, I spend all night on them"" Dusk said

""Thanks, oh and you and your sister are gonna be the lead singers"" Stylee said

""HANG ON WHAT!?"" Dusk and Dawn asked in shock

""Well if you want to prove to Molly you and you're sister reconciled, you gotta do it yourself, not me"" Stylee explained

""Now presenting the guest star of the school, presenting the underwater star herself, STYLEE"" Lunar said over the speaker system ""Mario what are you doing?""

""Oho, hello, it'sa me, aMario"" Mario said ""Oooh, what do you have there? Can I have it?""

""Mario no, this is for important announcement"" Lunar explained

""Well I got an announcement"" Mario said with a ringing sound following ""WHO EVER TOOK ALL THE SPAGHETTI! YOU HAVE THREE DAYS UNTIL MARIO STEAL YOUR LIVER""

""GODDAMMIT MARIO!"" SMG4 said and a fighting noise can be heard over the speakers

We then see Deema with a plate of spaghetti and after hearing that, she slowly hid it under the table then Lunar and SMG4 teleported near the drama queen holding Mario all bruised

""Keep an eye on him will you Deema?"" Lunar asked

""Uh, sure"" Deema responded

""Now with that out of the way, I give you, STYLEE!"" Lunar said hitting a few buttons backstage

Smoke formed on the stage, a silhouette of a mermaid appeared and cheers and applauding can be heard. As the smoke clears, Stylee becomes visible as the audience cheered for her

""Hey everyone, it's so nice to meet you here, now before we get into the songs, I have two people I'd like you to meet?"" Stylee said ""Please give your attention to a really fabulous duo, with a style all on their own, Dusk and Dawn""

""Wait what"" Molly said in shock

""I was wondering where those two went"" Purp. Jr said

""Hey everyone, now I'd like to dedicate this song to a very special person in my life, someone who helped me inspire my passion for music"" Dusk said ""This is for you Molly""

""I INSPIRED HIM!"" Molly said

""Well yeah, Dusk has always been a fan of you as your singing talent allowed him to ignite his passion for music, he even sings some of the songs you sing in his free time"" Purp. Jr explained

""Hm, perhaps I misjudged him"" Molly thought to herself as techno music began and Dusk put his hand on the stage possessing and upgrading it while Dawn pulled out a keyboard and started playing

""When I first saw you sing on live tv""

""I knew you were the perfect girl for me""

""Even when I fought through the odds""

""I brawled with a tv head and my friends fought a god""

""I did it all to meet yooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuu""

""All I gotta say is that""

""For you, I would love you even as a bat""

""You sang of trucks, trains, bugs and space""

""Yet you are elegant and full of grace""

""Even as a robot blob on her back""

""I'd say all these events are pretty whack""

""Wow the guys got great talent in singing"" Gil said ""Perhaps he can join our singing group""

""I guess so Gilly"" Molly responded

""With the bonds I formed with your friends""

""Without you it felt like the end""

""Even with his bad luck""

""From his wild imagination

""To her wild personality""

""To her heart as sweet as cream""

""Even with his high IQ""

""All I gotta say is""

""I've made up with my sis""

As Dusk finished his song, his body couldn't possess the stage any longer and it snapped back to him.

""Whew, that was rough"" Dusk said as the crowd cheered

""That was great song you made Dusk"" Dawn said hugging her brother

""That was amazing you too"" Stylee said hugging the two

""Uh guys"" Dawn said

""What is it Dawn?"" Dusk asked

""Is the disco ball supposed to be looking like it's about to fall?"" Dawn asked

""Of course it's not, that would be a-oh no, OH NO"" Stylee said looking up and she turned the volume on her microphone up ""GUYS YOU NEED TO MOVE! THE DISCO BALL IS GONNA FALL""

As Stylee finished her sentence, the rope holding the disco ball snapped and fell down, the disco ball hit the floor with a large crash and cracks formed all over it

""Well luckily no one got hurt"" Lunar said teleporting on the main floor and leaned against the disco ball ""I don't remember there ever being an oval shaped disco ball-WOAH!""

Lunar slipped but was able to get his balance back easily, when he looked down on his hand, he noticed there was paint on it

""Huh, that's odd, wouldn't buying a disco ball be cheaper than painting an oval to look like a disco balll"" Lunar said as curiosity got the better of him and he summoned shadow clones to wipe all the paint off, when Lunar notice what it was, he face turned from curious, to horror ""Oh, god. I thought they went extinct""

What Lunar revealed to the audience was a giant egg, and the cracks on it got bigger and the egged burst opened revealing that inside it, was a Smoky Progg with it emitting a red gas. Lunar then teleported onto the stage and grabbed Stylee's microphone

""Everyone you need to get out of here now"" Lunar told the audience ""This right here is a Smoky Progg, a deadly alien creature being able to emit a red fog like gas called gloom, one touch and you'll die, SO GET OUT OF HERE AS QUICK AS YOU CAN!""

Panic ensues as multiple students try to get out and gloom filled the room

""C'MON DAWN WE HAVE TO MOVE!"" Dusk said pulling at Dawn's body towards the exit

""No, look over there"" Dawn said pointing to Molly who couldn't escape as she was surrounded by gloom ""Even though I haven't reached my full potiental, it's still worth a shot saving Molly

""Dusk, I'm not making the same mistake I made during the practice drill, I'm not using my powers to save my own skin anymore"" Dawn said grabbing Dusk's hand ""I'm using it to protect the people we care about""

The two teleport towards Molly and ready their attacks, Dawn envelopes her hands in shadows while Dusk possesses a nearby speaker

""What are you two doing here, if you don't leave now we'll all die"" Molly said

""That was the old me"" Dawn explained ""This one teams up with her brother and protects those they care about""

Dawn slashes towards the oncoming fog of gloom while Dusk sends out speaker waves but to no avail

""Whelp we're screwed"" Dusk said

""CAN'T YOU TELEPORT US OUT OF HERE"" Molly yelled

""I can only teleport me and Dusk as we share the same body"" Dawn said ""Well, it was nice knowing you two""

""Wait hang on, Dusk, aren't you a Galvanic Mechamorph?"" Molly asked

""Yeah, where are you going with this?"" Dusk asked

""Have you tried upgrading your sister, that way you can upgrade her elemental abilities"" Molly explained putting her hands together

""Well it's worth a shot"" Dusk said

""Yeah what other choice do we have"" Dawn said ""For all this time I've been fighting your possession, but now I wonder what happens if I embrace it""

Dusk began to cover Dawn's body with his own while Dawn wasn't fighting it, she was accepting it. Then the two began to glow as Dusk fully covered Dawn's body, while near the gym exit, Purp. Jr notices that Mario's body is beginning to glow

""OH COME ON! DUSK AND DAWN TOO"" Purp. Jr yelled punching the ground ""WHY AM I THE ONLY ELEMENTAL GUARDIAN LEFT WHO HASN'T REACHED HER FULL POTENTIAL YET!""

""It's alright Purp. Jr"" Gil said rubbing her back ""You'll get it someday""

Back inside the gymnasium, the Smoky Progg launches a ball of gloom at the three but Dusk and Dawn easily reflect it and then they turn towards Molly

""Shall we go to a safer area?"" Dusk and Dawn said in unison with a distorted voice

""How?"" Molly asked ""You can't teleport others except yourself and your brother""

""You'd be surprised what reaching your full potential can do to you"" the two sibling said at once

The two quickly teleport Molly outside the gymnasium and teleport back in

""Molly"" Gil said rushing to her and giving her a hug ""You're back, are you hurt? Do you need to see the nurse? Are you gonna be alright?""

""Don't worry Gilly, I'm okay"" Molly said

Meanwhile back in the gymnasium we see Dusk and Dawn staring down the Smoky Progg

""Your terrorizing and gloom emitting days are over you sick beast"" the two siblings said as the summoned a bunch of shadow clones ""You'll pay for your actions""

The shadow clones possessed the entire gymnasium covering it with the texture of a Galvanic Mechamorph and a bunch of wholes opened up revealing weapons

""Now feel the wrath and might, OF THE SHADOW!"" Dusk and Dawn yelled at once launching a flurry of glowmobs at the Smoky Progg creating an extremely bright light

Meanwhile in space we see a man sipping his coffee in a space station

""Hey Jim what'd you see man"" another astronaut asked

""I don't know Billy, looks like another war broke out and someone dropped a light bomb made to blind everyone in a certain radius"" Jim said

Back inside the gymnasium, we see the gym returning to normal as the weapons go back in the wholes and they seal up, Dusk and Dawn slowly float down and separate as they stopped glowing and the people just outside went back in when they realized the light died down

""Man that was some light, almost like you could see it from space"" Goby said

""Well no matter what, what matters is is that the threat is gone now."" Electro said

Molly, Stylee and Lunar quickly went towards Dusk and Dawn and hugged them

""Man you two were awesome out there, who knew you both would actually work well when you didn't try to kill each other"" Lunar said

""That was amazing, you never told me you were an Elemental Guardian"" Stylee said as he got close to Dusk ""And it seems like someone has something to say to you""

Dusk then noticed that Molly was right across him

""Dusk, I just want to say, you were really cool, and that battle you and your sister fought clearly showed me that you two have reconciled"" Molly said getting close to Dusk

""Woah what, what are you doing?"" Dusk asked

""Consider this a gift for saving me"" Molly said puckering her lips and she gave Dusk a kiss while Dusk just accepted and went with it

""WOAH! NICE ONE ROMEO!"" Dawn said before getting a tail slap by Molly",1,1754263886.0,SMG4,0,1.0,False

The core feature is email sending, it's helping users preparing for coding interviews by sending daily email to users that explains 1 DSA pattern and 3 related coding problems. 

Now, 2k users = 60k emails per month, the cheapest mail sending service would cost me around 50-100$/month, the server cost, AI cost also involved. 

I'm planning to charge as minimum as possible like maybe 1 coffee per month = 5$ only! Still somehow I feel like that would stop many users who love the product to stop using it or not be able to use the premium features I'm going to add!

All I remember is that the city is cute. I will be there from 13.09. till 16.09. and usually I dislike those posts people asking for the cheap places to go but as Norway is just so so expensive, please allow me to rather ask for the affordable places to go, eat and so on. To be precise: 

1: I love old cinemas, is there any in Bergen to be worth visiting? I Germany movies are cheaper on Tuesdays or sometimes before 15 pm. Anything like that in Norway?

2. Want to find a nice sauna, do not need any chi chi, rather a place with the chance to take a dip in a lake or the sea? Do I remember correctly that it is to be used not naked? I remember having had a couch surfing guest from Norway 20 years ago saying he was in heaven when we visited a Sauna in Hamburg:)

3. I remember that there are indian or thai fast food places which are very good and maybe you can name me your favorite place?

4. Any gym offering day tickets and having ""Hot Iron"" group classes? I already found a place for Reformer Pilates but would love to do this on the other day?

5. Last but not least: what is your favorite Coffee Roaster? I like Espresso rather the dark italian way:)

oh and of course LEFSE !!! Where to go...

While writing this, my fists won’t stop hurting I can’t tell if it’s the grip or the fear or the way I know she’s behind me. I don’t want to look. I already know what I’ll see...


I didn’t notice it at first. Honestly, I thought I was just tired too many late nights, too much coffee, and too many hours staring at screens. But then she showed up. At the train station. Just standing there on the opposite platform like she’d been waiting for me. Normal clothes. Normal face. Except when she smiled. There was something off not dramatic, not obvious  just this... stretch. Like her mouth opened a little too wide. Like it wanted to keep going. The worst part is, no one even noticed. That's why I started to think that I was just tired.


But after that incident something happened that changed me.. 

After showering I looked myself in the mirror, the smile was there again.. behind me.. I looked back, 𝑛𝑜 𝑜𝑛𝑒 was there. 

After the mirror, I stopped trusting reflections. 

It’s not like I stopped using them completely you kind of can’t. But I found ways to avoid really 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔. Brushed my teeth while staring at the sink. Got dressed using shadows. Put lipstick with half eyes closed.

I didn’t talk to anyone about it. Not even Ethan, my roommate, and we’ve lived together since college. He wouldn’t get it. No one would. 

And for a while… I managed. A week, maybe. She didn’t show up. Not in windows, not in crowds. I thought maybe that was it. A sleep-deprived hallucination, a weird subconscious loop. Brains do that, right? You see one odd thing, your mind keeps reusing it. Dreams get in the way of real life. I Googled it. Made sense. 

Then one night I caught her in a Zoom call. 

We had this late client meeting, everyone tired and quiet. I wasn’t even speaking  just watching the tiles shift around. Then for half a second, the screen glitched. It froze, just a flicker, like a connection stutter. 

And there she was. In my square. Right behind me, over my shoulder.. Just barely there. Blurry, like motion blur. But I recognized the hair. And the shape of her smile. 

I turned around in my chair so fast I knocked over my coffee. Nothing was there. No shadow, no noise. Just my jacket on the back of the door. 

But when I looked back at the screen, three coworkers had gone quiet. 

“Hey,” one of them said. “Who was that just now? Behind you.” 

I just ended the call. 

I didn’t sleep the night after the Zoom call. 

Every time I closed my eyes, I could feel her behind me. Not hear 𝑓𝑒𝑒𝑙. Like warmth that didn’t belong. Like breath on the wrong part of your neck. 

The next morning, I checked the video recording. We always save client calls, just in case. I scrubbed through it frame by frame, holding my breath. 

Nothing. 

No glitch. No figure. Not even the coffee spill. 

I started crying, not from fear. From 𝑑𝑜𝑢𝑏𝑡, I could handle a ghost, honestly. Even a stalker, somehow. But this? Not knowing whether my brain was betraying me? That scared me more than anything. 

I made an appointment with a neurologist. Booked a psych consult. Started journaling. No mirrors, no reflections, no photos. Just words. ""𝑆ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦."" ""𝑁𝑜 𝑜𝑛𝑒 𝑒𝑙𝑠𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑤 ℎ𝑒𝑟."" ""𝑀𝑎𝑦𝑏𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑚𝑒 𝑢𝑛𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔"" 

The night before my appointment, I found something under my pillow. 

A tooth. 

Perfectly clean. Not bloody, not broken. Just… placed. Like someone had tucked it there, gently. 

I haven’t lost any teeth. Not mine. 

I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just sat on the edge of the bed holding it, cold in my palm, and thought: 𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡  𝑖𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑖𝑠 𝑛𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑜 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑝? 

So I did something drastic. 

I booked a room in a hotel with no mirrors. I packed only what I needed. I left my phone. I left a note for Ethan,  just a “taking time away” kind of thing. Nothing dramatic. I don’t want people thinking I’m a threat to myself. 

I’m not. 

But here’s the thing: I’ve started pulling my own teeth. 

Not all of them. Not at once. Just one, every few days. Cleanly. Carefully. It's not hard if you ice your gums and know what you’re doing. 

Because I think that’s what she wants. 

She keeps smiling at me, even now, and 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑒 𝑖𝑠 𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒..

1mgxnk9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgxnk9,Ride report: my first GAP + C&O trip!,"Yesterday I finished my first ride of the combined GAP and C&O routes. This one’s been on my list for several years now and I was happy to finally get a break in the work and family schedules to tick it off. I didn’t pull the trigger on the ride until maybe 2 weeks before leaving, so most of my prep was done quickly. I did the ride solo.

My MO on rides like this one is to move pretty quickly and not dawdle too much - it’s not for everyone, but I’d rather spend time on the bike than sitting around camp or exploring little towns.

For the ride I was on my gravel bike and packed as lightly as possible (though it didn’t feel like it). I had my tent in a bar bag. In the fork drybags I had tent poles, sleep system, cooking kit and any given day’s food, coffee supplies, chain wax and sealant. Frame bag had some toiletries, power bank and charging cords, water filter, bug spray. Saddle bag had on- and off-bike clothing, remaining food and toiletries, sneakers. Repair kit was under the downtube. In addition to having bottles in the frame I rode with a 2L hydration pack - I preferred to never have to worry about when my next refill would be, and it let me have both clean water and drink mix/electrolytes at all times.

Logistics and route:

* I flew into PGH and stayed overnight at the Fairfield Inn Downtown. This gave me an afternoon to rebuild my bike, run over to REI for camp stove fuel and anything I’d forgotten, get a good night’s sleep so that I could start early the next morning.
* I’d shipped my bike in advance via BikeFlights, so it was already at the hotel waiting for me. Cost was comparable to if I’d checked it on my flight.
* I reserved a one-way car rental at DCI to get home.
* Day 1: Pittsburgh to Confluence (93 miles). I stayed at the Paddler’s Lane camp site after multiple recommendations.
* Day 2: Confluence to Cumberland (59 miles). Hotel night.
* Day 3: Cumberland to Hancock, shortened due to thunderstorms (60 miles). Planned to camp but got a room as a walk-in to avoid the storms. I'd glad I skipped camping after seeing the storm damage.
* Day 4: Hancock to Point of Rocks (84 miles). Camped at the Calico Rocks hiker-biker site.
* Day 5: Point of Rocks to DC + rental car pickup (60 miles)
* The route that I used with select POIs: [https://ridewithgps.com/routes/45326186](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/45326186)

Observations:

* Weather forecasts seem particularly unreliable at the moment. My forecast called for almost entirely clear conditions, with light chance of showers for a couple of hours on one day. I had an afternoon of downpours, overnight rains on another day and dramatic storms on a third day that triggered flood warnings and brought trees down all over the C&O. Regardless what your forecast says I’d plan for rain, especially in the summer.
* People warned me about the rougher surface and slower going of the C&O but I found it fairly comfortable. I wouldn’t want to do it on a road bike, but if you’re used to gravel riding I think it’s fine. Interestingly my average pace was only the teeniest bit slower (like 0.3 mph) on the C&O vs. the GAP, and that could have also been the accumulated fatigue on the back half of the ride. There are some patches of loose or rounded golf ball-sized stones on the C&O but they’re mostly short.
* Plan out your meal stops in advance. I’m an early riser and found that my options for midday meals came either 90 minutes into my ride or 15 miles before I was going to end my day. A lot of places I’d mapped out were also closed for 2+ weeks despite what Google Maps said. I’d planned to stop for lunch most days but it didn’t work out more often than not. In retrospect I should have carried lunch with me most days, either as a camp meal or picking up something to go in the morning.
* I generally do well enough riding in hot weather, but the humidity could be oppressive at times. While I never got problematically dehydrated I was sweating more than usual. I’d highly recommend being mindful of your hydration and drinking more than you think you need to.
* I thought I overpacked camp meals, with 4 entrees and 1 breakfast, but I ate them all. In retrospect I wish I’d carried more.
* The descent into Cumberland may have been my favorite part of the ride. After going uphill for a day and a half, finally getting some speed felt amazing. If you’re a comfortable gravel descender you’ll really enjoy it.
* If you detour to Antietam National Battlefield, stop in at Burkholder’s Baked Goods in Sharpsburg. I’m going to be thinking about those donuts for a while and I wish I’d bought more than one of the apple fritters to take with me.
* Camping may not be very restful if you’re a light sleeper, especially on the C&O. Most of the camp sites are right along train tracks and the freight trains run all night long.
* I had camp sites to myself each night. Might have just been luck, especially as the ones closer to DC seemed busy on Friday night/Saturday morning, but I appreciated it.
* Watch out for deer, especially at dawn and dusk. I had several close calls and watched one run directly in front of another rider (and towards me) for about a hundred yards before darting into the treeline.
* I think I saw a mountain lion cub on the descent into Cumberland.
* I brought my most powerful headlight and was happy to have it for the long tunnels and one pre-dawn start. I get mildly claustrophic and the Big Savage and Paw Paw tunnels had my heart racing, but I watched another rider crash themself out in panic in Big Savage.
* Thunderstorms and flash flooding on day 3 brought trees and branches down all over the C&O, especially around Great Falls, making the last 2 days a bit of an obstacle course. I took advantage of the paved rail trails that parallel the Towpath in several places, but there are long stretches with no diversion option if you hit obstructions.
* Ironically, water gets more scarce on the last leg into DC - that’s the only time I nearly ran out. Having a water filter with me was invaluable, especially on the C&O where well pumps are frequent but frequently marked as non-potable without doing your own water treatment.
* Ending in DC on a Saturday was a mistake, in hindsight. The final stretch was incredibly busy with tourists and general weekend activity and it kind of spoiled the meditative experience I’d had until that point. If I did it again, I’d plan it as a Sunday-Thursday ride rather than a Tuesday-Saturday.
* My car rental was at DCI airport in DC…except it was sneakily at an off-airport location that my reservation emails didn’t indicate. Riding there was a pain in the ass and put a damper on the afterglow of finishing the route.

1mgxn4p,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mgxn4p,Everything in new home trips breakers,"1st time homeowner, new construction home, electrician work is like a foreign language to me. Moved into it at the beginning of April 2025 as soon as construction was complete. Kind of a long story, but I'll try to condense as much as I can. I'm at a loss here.

Everything in the house has worked great from April until Wednesday of last week when I woke up for work and noticed that our fridge was off. Checked the breaker panel and saw that the breaker was tripped. Tried to reset the breaker, but it would automatically trip every time. I was running late for work, so I went to make coffee and the coffee pot tripped the breaker for its outlet as well. I submitted a warranty request through our home builder's portal and they sent a guy out to look at everything.

The guy told my wife ""your fridge is bad and needs to be replaced"" and then left. Throughout the course of the day, other electronics started tripping breakers as well. Our washing machine, dishwasher, microwave, coffee pot, living room tv, and both my 3D printer (Bambulab P1P) and PC (custom built, 500w power supply) all cause the breakers to trip.

The electrician came back out on Friday and initially said ""Your fridge is bad, needs to be replaced. Your dishwasher is also bad, needs to be replaced. Your coffee pot is too strong for the plug it's plugged into, and the rest of the electronics are probably overloading your house."" After about 2 hours he said ""well, maybe it's the ambient heat from your box being in direct sunlight. Your breakers are rated for 40 degrees Celcius (we live in the Texas hill country)""

After about 30 more minutes he said, ""maybe you should call the utility company and have them check the transformer/meter"" (The utility company came out and said everything was good on their end)

They are coming out tomorrow morning to replace all my breakers, to see if that works.

I'm stumped, they're stumped, and we haven't had the ability to use really any of our appliances for almost a week now.

we had a conversation last night that rubbed me wrong. he proposed to me at his cottage on the 1st of aug. were here for a little vacation, last night we were sitting on the back deck talking about our future a bit. he is opening another branch of his company soon and is branching out of california to more states so we have a bit of travel ahead- i said i would probably finish my classes online and then i was thinking of looking for something part-time in hospitality because i like serving and its flexible for travelling

he kinda laughed and said i wouldnt be doing that, and that he was assuming i wouldn't work at all. if i did that makes it look like hes ""failing as a husband""

i was like oh, what an odd thing to say. i don't think a single person would assume that personally.

but it just reminded me too, how even when we were newly dating (2 months in) he didnt want me driving my crappy car because he thought it would be embarrassing if someone saw he was letting me drive around in it. now he is saying it would be embarrassing if someone saw i was working in a restaurant. he also said i was free to pursue my acting, (im an aspiring actress, not making ay money yet).. so thats fine but not another job

its confusing tbh

im thinking this is a rich person thing, but it rubbed me wrong. i dont care what people think i just wanna do what makes me happy. i can kinda get what hes saying i guess, but i also grew up pretty dirt poor, so just curious for people with money is this a normal way for yall to feel, or a red flag?",0,1754263004.0,relationship_advice,32,0.4,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Seattle Sounders vs. Santos Laguna: A Leagues Cup Showdown Where the Odds Are as Clear as a Rainy Day in Seattle**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a match that’s as lopsided as a soufflé in a hurricane. The **Seattle Sounders** (1.24) are favored to steamroll **Santos Laguna** (8.25-10.0), per the bookies, who clearly bet this one while half-asleep on their couch. Let’s break this down with the precision of a caffeinated spreadsheet and the humor of a barista who’s seen 10,000 espresso shots.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why Seattle’s Implied Probability Feels Like a Tax Audit

The Sounders’ +124 to +128 odds (translating to \~81% implied probability) scream “bank on this” louder than a Seattle rainstorm screams “take an umbrella.” Meanwhile, Santos Laguna’s +825 to +1000 odds mean bookmakers think their chances are about as likely as a snowstorm in July… if July was a desert. The draw sits at 5.5-6.0 (16.7%-18.2% implied), which is basically the sportsbook’s way of saying, “Yeah, this game might be a blowout, but *maybe* someone will trip over their own shoelaces.”

The spread? Seattle’s -1.75 goals is like asking Santos to climb Mount Rainier in flip-flops. The total goals line (3.5) is a middle finger to anyone who thinks this will be a low-scoring snoozefest.

### Digesting the News: Coffee, Curses, and Comebacks

Seattle enters this match fresh off a loss to Cruz Azul but still alive in the tournament. Their defense? Tighter than a Starbucks latte in winter. Their offense? A well-oiled espresso machine, churning out goals with the consistency of a Seattle drizzle.

Santos Laguna, meanwhile, is reeling from a loss to Portland and carrying the weight of Mexican football’s eternal quest to “*fix their cursed American tour.*” They’ll need a miracle—or m

* Watch out for deer, especially at dawn and dusk. I had several close calls and watched one run directly in front of another rider (and towards me) for about a hundred yards before darting into the treeline.
* I think I saw a mountain lion cub on the descent into Cumberland.
* I brought my most powerful headlight and was happy to have it for the long tunnels and one pre-dawn start. I get mildly claustrophic and the Big Savage and Paw Paw tunnels had my heart racing, but I watched another rider crash themself out in panic in Big Savage.
* Thunderstorms and flash flooding on day 3 brought trees and branches down all over the C&O, especially around Great Falls, making the last 2 days a bit of an obstacle course. I took advantage of the paved rail trails that parallel the Towpath in several places, but there are long stretches with no diversion option if you hit obstructions.
* Ironically, water gets more scarce on the last leg into DC - that’s the only time I nearly ran out. Having a water filter with me was invaluable, especially on the C&O where well pumps are frequent but frequently marked as non-potable without doing your own water treatment.
* Ending in DC on a Saturday was a mistake, in hindsight. The final stretch was incredibly busy with tourists and general weekend activity and it kind of spoiled the meditative experience I’d had until that point. If I did it again, I’d plan it as a Sunday-Thursday ride rather than a Tuesday-Saturday.
* My car rental was at DCI airport in DC…except it was sneakily at an off-airport location that my reservation emails didn’t indicate. Riding there was a pain in the ass and put a damper on the afterglow of finishing the route.

As the title suggests, I’m moving away from home for university and am trying to make the most of the time I have left by appreciating what this city has to offer before it’s too late. 

I’ve recently discovered that, contrary to what I grew up telling myself, I do actually enjoy coffee and am having a lot of fun visiting new places to give them a try. I know there are loads of coffee/cafe recommendations in this thread already, but I’m more after the local gems and spots that are unique to Perth in some way. 

I’m often alone and so I get a real joy from talking to the staff, especially about coffee (the more info dumping the better) as it makes me feel like I have more friends than I actually do. I also really love the learning process and finding out how coffee works. I’m mainly in the CBD/South of the River, usually only going as far North as Nedlands, but I’m willing to go anywhere worth it by public transport. I’m a long black/batch brew/filter coffee drinker if that makes any difference. I like matcha too but it annoys me slightly that it’s almost always in latte form. 

Conversely, if there’s anywhere you consider overrated, I’d be curious to know why. I know it’s not possible to perfectly maximize my remaining time to hit all the best places (and that such opinions are highly suggestive), but I do think it would be interesting to discuss. 

Some of my already new favourites are March Coffee Studio, Offshoot Coffee, Coffee Connection in the Freo Markets and Howard’s Groove. I’ve had great first experiences at Little Soho Cafe and Leeway Cafe too and plan on revisiting. Standing Room Only and Voodoo Cafe (both also in the CBD) have been the only places to let me down so far, and I have mixed feelings on Finn’s Espresso and Nero Espresso Coffee. Given the rambling nature of this post you can probably tell that I’m quite happy to discuss the local coffee scene with anyone willing. 

Sorry for not the most original post, but I hope we can chat in the comments!",5,1754262820.0,perth,2,1.0,False
