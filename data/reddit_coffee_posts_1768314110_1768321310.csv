I baked 2 9” rounds and cut and “glued” the tops of the heart from the bottom of the cake to avoid cluttering my bakery cabinet with another cake pan. The frosting got really warm by the time I got to the border on the top and when I put the bags in the fridge it had trouble coming out of the tip but pretty happy with it overall!!

I have my friends, she has her friends and it's all good.

The situation: I've known from the beginning that she has a long time friend, let's call him Jake. Sometimes when she's in the city she meets Jake for a drink in a bar, or has lunch with him, they have deep talks. They're friends for 15 years, he's a social worker and about 10 years older than her, he met her through that way when she was a teen. He also worked with other people/teens at the time, including some friends of her know him as well.

Jake has allegedly a girlfriend for a long time and has 1 or 2 kids (don't remember). My gf says she never saw his girlfriend, which I found odd.

She says she has a deep connection with him and enjoys the talks because he's emotionally intelligent and also esoteric/spiritual.

I don't feel threatened because I also have deeper talks with with friends of mine, also me and her are well connected emotionally.

However one day we were taking about him and I asked if the ever had anything before. 
She told me they didn't and she doesn't have interest in him at all but about 8 years ago they got a bit tipsy at a bar and he hit on her. 

She said she put boundaries fast and even took months till seeing him again. And that in was a one time thing from him. She said he got her message. 
It never happened again. 

I understood the situation and people can be tipsy and do these things even though it didn't sit right with me. I asked if he had a girlfriend at the time and she's unsure but doesn't think so.

However she also told me that they never ever did anything with other people. 

That's what I don't get, I immediately introduced her to my friends, we do things together and she does the same with me with her other friends but with this one it's so private. They always want to meet one-on-one. 

That's what I don't get. I have friends that sometimes meet for a coffee or whatever but I include them in my activities with other friends from time to time, or girlfriends. 

Never had a female friend whom I only met always alone.

I'm not sure if this is something that's considered normal to do. Tips to navigate the situation?",0,1768320889.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

1qbvcne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1qbvcne/aitah_for_distancing_myself_from_my_friend/,AITAH for distancing myself from my friend?,"Hi all.

I (25F) started working at a job the same time as this woman (22F), let’s call her Mary, about a year ago and we became super close since the beginning. Today I would call her my best friend. We see each other at least once a week outside of work and talk every day.

We get new coworkers frequently. A few months ago, maybe sometime in August or September, this woman (24F), let’s call her Julia, began working with us. I’d gotten to know her at work a bit and was super impressed with what she was studying and her drive for this particular career, which we’d connected over. A few days later, in front of myself and a few other people, Julia was talking to an older gay employee and called herself a ‘YAOI’ and admitted to being a furry. Immediately this made me (a gay woman) uncomfortable because she is straight but I figured maybe she just admired the storytelling of YAOI. 

A few days after this, a different gay male  coworker (not the man she told this stuff to earlier) and I were talking and he proceeded to tell me that him and Julia were “gooning” to photos and proceeded to show me snapchat messages with her that showed pictures of animated/drawn gay porn. This obviously made me more uncomfortable to which I then asked him if he felt like Julia was fetishizing queer people and culture, to which he replied “Maybe”. But it didn’t seem to bother him. 

Okay. If it didn’t bother him, a gay man, I guess I should just ignore it, right?

Maybe a week or two after this conversation, my friend Mary tells me that she was speaking to Julia about seeing her hair (Julia wears a hijab) and Julia told her that in Islam, lesbians aren’t allowed to see another woman’s hair. HUH? My parents are middle eastern and I grew up in a muslim household, so I knew this wasn’t true. Mary is gay btw.

I told Mary that this was super weird and it kind of felt like she was being borderline homophobic but Mary didn’t feel that way. So once again, brushed it under the rug.

Now a few days after this, I’m speaking to the gay male coworker that mentioned the “gooning” and we’re talking. He says something about how I look and I say something like Is it because I look like a bitch? (joking). Julia — mind you, since I had the conversation with the gay male coworker about her fetishizing gay people, she had not spoken to me since — walks past me and says “Yes”.

Okay. Maybe she’s trying to joke with me. I don’t know. 

Weeks go on and she’s ONLY being aggressive with me. My friend Mary keeps talking about her and how nice she is. Each time Julia sees Mary at work she exclaims MARY!!!!!! or gets extremely touchy with her. A part of me is like… this feels intentional but I can’t prove it. I explain all this stuff to Mary like right after it all happens but she doesn’t see how it can be weird or mean.

NOW.. Last week all four of us are working. We end up all clocked out and near the exit talking amongst other coworkers and Julia is holding Mary’s hand, touching her, all of this. She says bye to Mary and doesn’t say anything to me.

The next day, from across the workspace I hear her say bye to Mary super loud then she comes to where I am to clock out and says out loud “I love mary”. Mind you i’m the only one near her. 

At this point I’m like I must be tripping. Like honest to God maybe she’s just a nice loving person. So I clock in and keep an open mind and say hi to Julia. She says nothing back. Later that day before my break I stay a little longer to help clean up before she takes over in my station. She randomly asks me to brew coffee but from the corner of my eye I SEE HER close the top part of the pot so that if I brewed any it would brew all over the place. I don’t say anything I just open the top part and brew coffee. Maybe it’s an honest mistake.

Later that day its her time to clock out and there’s no one to cover her station so I volunteer to go over. I say sorry and that nobody knew she was done. She aggressively tells me everyone knew and I keep trying to smooth it over but she’s just giving me attitude. Mind you no one else is around.

Mary talks about Julia when we hang out at least once every time. I hate hearing about her. So I explain ALL OF THIS to Mary, fully in depth, telling her how I feel and how this situation is making me feel and she basically says “Yeah that’s weird… But I don’t think Julia is like that”

A few days later, I’m really at my wits end so I open up to Mary again. She basically seems to understand this time and seems empathetic and I’m thinking thank God i’ll never have to hear about her again.

NOPE.

Next day we’re out together, she’s talking about her again.

1qbvabb,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qbvabb/what_is_ddos_in_gaming/,What is DDoS in Gaming?,"Ever been in the middle of a ranked match when your internet suddenly dies? Your teammates are yelling, the enemy team is pushing, and you're staring at a disconnect screen. If it happens once, bad luck. If it happens repeatedly when you're winning? You might be getting DDoSed.

DDoS attacks in gaming aren't some rare boogeyman—they're a daily reality. Gaming was the most targeted industry for HTTP DDoS attacks, with Layer 7 incidents spiking 94% year over year. When angry opponents can rent a botnet for $10 and knock you offline mid-match, understanding DDoS protection becomes as important as mastering your aim.

✅ **Quick Answer:** A DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack in gaming floods your network or a game server with massive fake traffic, overwhelming it until normal connections fail. Players get DDoSed when attackers learn their IP address through voice chat programs, game servers, or malicious links. The best protection is using a VPN like NordVPN to hide your real IP and route attacks to heavily defended VPN servers instead.

# What Is a DDoS Attack in Gaming?

A DDoS attack works by flooding your network connection with so much junk data that legitimate traffic can't get through. Picture a highway where suddenly 10,000 empty cars show up blocking every lane—real drivers (your game packets) can't move.

Here's what makes DDoS attacks particularly nasty in gaming:

**Botnets do the heavy lifting.** Attackers don't use their own computer. They control thousands of infected devices (the ""botnet"") that all send traffic to your IP simultaneously. Your home router sees 500,000 connection requests per second and just gives up.

**UDP floods are the weapon of choice.** Games use UDP protocol for speed—it's faster than TCP but has no built-in protection. Attackers exploit this by sending massive UDP packets that your network has to process. Your game traffic gets buried under the avalanche.

**The attacker needs your IP address.** This is critical. If they don't know where you live (digitally), they can't attack you. Everything that follows hinges on keeping your IP hidden.

|Attack Type|Target|Method|Impact|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Volumetric**|Your bandwidth|Massive data floods (Tbps-scale)|Complete connection loss|
|**Protocol**|Your router/firewall|Exploits network protocols|Extreme lag, timeouts|
|**Application Layer**|Game server software|Mimics legitimate traffic|Server crashes, disconnects|
|**Targeted Player**|Your home IP|Botnet flood|You get booted offline|

The gaming industry's vulnerability is economic. With 2.58 billion players globally generating $184.4 billion in revenue, the financial incentive to disrupt competitors is enormous. A rival game server getting knocked offline means your server gains players. A streamer getting booted means their audience might switch channels.

💡 **Pro Tip:** DDoS attacks on individual players are way more common than most people realize. Professional esports players and streamers get targeted regularly—it's not paranoia to take protection seriously.

# The Real-World Impact: When Gaming Gets Attacked

Let's talk numbers that matter. In Q1 alone, Cloudflare blocked 20.5 million DDoS attacks—that's almost as many as the entire previous year. The largest gaming-focused attack peaked at 6.5 Tbps, matching the highest bandwidth assaults ever recorded.

Gaming remains in the top tier of targeted industries. While technology companies now face more attacks overall (30% of all DDoS incidents), gaming still accounts for 19% of attacks. Financial services saw a 117% spike in attacks, but gamers aren't getting off easy—the attacks are just getting smarter and shorter.

**The Minemen Club incident** in 2024 shows how brutal these attacks get. The Minecraft server got hit with 3.15 billion packets per second from a Russian, Vietnamese, and South Korean botnet spanning 18 countries. That's not a teenager with a grudge—that's organized infrastructure.

Major platforms aren't immune. Call of Duty and World of Warcraft servers faced repeated DDoS campaigns. Several major gaming platforms went offline simultaneously in October after coordinated attacks linked to the Aisuru botnet. The October outage wasn't 10 minutes—it was hours of frustrated players unable to access services they'd paid for.

🔒 **Security Note:** The average DDoS attack now lasts 5 hours, down from 16 hours. Attackers use shorter, more intense ""burst"" attacks that blend with normal traffic spikes, making detection harder. Your 10-minute connection loss might actually be a targeted attack, not ISP problems.

# How Attackers Get Your IP Address

Think your IP is safe just because you're using Steam or Xbox Live? You're mostly right—official game servers hide your IP by default. But there are weak points.

# Voice Chat Programs: The Old Vulnerability

Skype used to be a goldmine for attackers. It used peer-to-peer connections that exposed your IP to anyone you talked to. They've fixed that now, but older voice programs like Ventrilo and Mumble still leak IPs. Even Discord has had incidents where IPs accidentally showed on screen.

If you're using any voice chat program, check the settings. Make sure it routes calls through the service's servers, not peer-to-peer. Better yet, use Discord with a VPN.

# Third-Party Game Servers

Playing Minecraft on a friend's server? That admin can see your IP. Joining a community-run Counter-Strike or Team Fortress 2 server? Your IP is visible to whoever controls that server. This isn't always malicious—but if you stomp a server owner in-game and they're salty about it, they've got what they need.

# Malicious Links and IP Grabbers

Someone sends you a link in Discord. ""Check out this sick play bro."" You click it. Congrats—they just logged your IP through an IP grabber tool. These services disguise tracking links as legitimate URLs and record everyone who clicks them.

The rule is simple: don't click random links from people you don't trust completely. Even then, use a VPN so the IP they grab is meaningless.

# Malware and Infected Downloads

Download a ""free"" cheat tool for Fortnite? Install that ""custom texture pack"" from a sketchy site? Malware can report your IP back to the attacker along with a bonus keylogger that steals your game accounts. Popular games like FIFA, Fortnite, and Minecraft are frequent targets for malware-laden fake tools.

|IP Exposure Source|Risk Level|Mitigation|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Official game servers (Steam, Xbox, PlayStation)|🟢 Low|IPs hidden by default|

⚠️ **Warning:** If someone in-game says ""I'm going to IP boot you"" or ""You're getting booted offline,"" take it seriously. They're telling you they have your IP and are about to attack. Disconnect immediately, reset your router, and get a VPN running before reconnecting.

# Player Protection: How to Stop DDoS Attacks

What happens when a salty opponent decides they'd rather boot you than lose fairly? If your IP is exposed, you're toast. But if it's hidden behind a VPN? The attack hits the VPN's reinforced servers, not your home router.

# Use a Gaming VPN (The Nuclear Option)

A VPN hides your real IP address behind the VPN server's IP. When an attacker tries to flood you, they're actually flooding a data center built to handle terabits of traffic. You stay online. They waste their botnet.

**NordVPN** is specifically designed for this. All 8,900+ servers include DDoS protection—not just a handful of ""special"" servers. When you connect to NordVPN, you're routing through infrastructure that can absorb attacks that would instantly kill your home connection.

The NordLynx protocol keeps gaming smooth. It's based on WireGuard but adds extra privacy through double NAT, meaning even the VPN doesn't permanently store connection identifiers. I've tested it extensively—ping increase is minimal (usually 10-30ms) and speeds stay fast enough for competitive play.

Here's what makes NordVPN particularly good for gaming DDoS protection:

* **Threat Protection blocks malicious domains** before they can log your IP through grabber links
* **Kill switch prevents IP leaks** if the VPN connection drops mid-match
* **Split tunneling** lets you protect game traffic through the VPN while keeping voice chat on your regular connection for lower latency
* **Meshnet feature** allows secure encrypted connections for LAN parties without exposing real IPs

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Monthly VPN plans are ridiculously expensive. NordVPN's 2-year plan drops the price from $12.99/month to around $3/month—less than a single coffee. If you're serious about protection, commit to the long plan.

|VPN Feature|Why It Matters for Gaming DDoS|
|:-|:-|
|**IP Masking**|Hides your real location—attacks hit VPN servers|
|**DDoS-Resistant Servers**|Can handle Tbps-scale floods that kill home routers|
|**Low Latency**|NordLynx keeps ping under 50ms on nearby servers|
|**Kill Switch**|Blocks traffic if VPN drops—no IP exposure|
|**Multiple Locations**|Switch servers instantly if one gets targeted|
|**No-Logs Policy**|Your gaming sessions aren't tracked or stored|

# Reset Your IP Address Regularly

Even with a VPN, changing your home IP adds another layer. If you've been targeted before, your old IP is probably on someone's list.

The easiest method: unplug your router for 10 minutes. Most ISPs use dynamic IPs that expire when your router disconnects. Plug it back in and you get a new address.

If that doesn't work, call your ISP and request a new IP. Some will do it immediately, others make you wait 24 hours. Either way, it's free and breaks the attacker's lock on your location.

# Secure Your Voice Chat

Using Discord? Good—it hides IPs by default. But check your settings anyway. Under User Settings → Privacy & Safety, make sure you're not allowing direct calls from strangers.

If you're still on Skype (why?), enable ""Allow direct connections to your contacts only"" in Settings → Advanced. But honestly, just switch to Discord. The security and audio quality are better.

# Practice Link Hygiene

Someone sends you a link? Ask yourself: do I trust this person? Have I verified they meant to send this? Is the URL obviously suspicious (random characters, weird domain)?

If you're unsure, run it through a link checker like VirusTotal before clicking. Better yet, use a VPN so even if it's an IP grabber, they get useless information.

# Keep Everything Updated

Router firmware, game clients, voice chat programs, operating system—patch everything. Old software has vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. Router manufacturers regularly push security updates that block known attack patterns.

Check your router's admin panel (usually 192.168.1.1) and look for firmware updates. If your router is over 4 years old, seriously consider replacing it. Newer models have built-in DDoS protection and much better security.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** Using a VPN is non-negotiable if you're a competitive player, streamer, or anyone with a visible online presence. NordVPN's combination of gaming-optimized speeds, bulletproof privacy, and DDoS-resistant infrastructure makes it the top choice. The protection is worth way more than the $3/month cost.

# Game Server Host Protection: Defending Your Community

Running a game server puts you in a different threat category. You're not just protecting yourself—you're protecting dozens or hundreds of players who trust you to keep the server online.

# Choose a DDoS-Protected Host

This is step one. Don't try to host from your home connection unless you want to get obliterated. Professional game server hosts include DDoS mitigation as part of the package.

**OVHcloud** offers game-specific DDoS protection that understands UDP traffic patterns used by games. Their ""Game DDoS Protection"" profiles filter incoming and outgoing traffic through rules optimized for specific games. It's included free with their bare-metal game servers.

**Evolution Host** specializes in game server protection with their EvoShield system. They handle everything from Minecraft and Counter-Strike to FiveM and Garry's Mod. The network is monitored 24/7 and their team responds immediately to attacks.

**Gcore** protects major publishers like Wargaming and Albion Online. They analyze your specific traffic patterns and configure customized countermeasures. Only clean traffic reaches your game servers through dedicated channels.

|Hosting Provider|Mitigation Capacity|Best For|Starting Price|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**OVHcloud**|Massive (Tbps-scale)|Game-specific UDP protection|$40/month|
|**Evolution Host**|24/7 monitoring|Custom game firewall rules|$30/month|
|**Gcore**|Custom analysis|Enterprise publishers|Contact for quote|
|**Sparked Host**|Enterprise-grade|Layer 7 attack mitigation|$25/month|
|**LOW.MS**|Deep packet inspection|Large Minecraft/Rust servers|$35/month|

# Implement Application-Layer Protection

Network-layer protection stops the massive floods. But smart attackers use application-layer attacks that mimic legitimate player connections. These slip past basic firewalls.

Services like Cloudflare for Gaming provide application-aware protection. They recognize the difference between a real player joining and a bot hammering your login endpoint. The added latency is minimal (usually under 5ms) but the protection is massive.

# Use Whitelists and Access Control

Public servers are easier targets. If you can restrict who connects, do it:

* **Whitelist known players** for private/community servers
* **Use passwords** for friends-only sessions
* **Implement invite-only systems** where new players need approval

This won't stop volumetric attacks against your IP, but it prevents attackers from easily joining to scout your setup.

# Separate Your Infrastructure

Host your game server on one network segment and your other services (website, Discord bot, payment systems) on another. If attackers compromise your game server IP, they can't reach your other infrastructure.

Use VLANs or completely separate hosting providers. Some hosts offer ""guest network"" equivalents that isolate game servers from other services.

# Monitor and Respond Quickly

Set up monitoring that alerts you immediately when traffic spikes. Most DDoS attacks start with reconnaissance—small bursts to test your defenses. If you catch it early, you can switch IPs or enable additional filtering before the main attack hits.

Providers like OVHcloud and Gcore include real-time dashboards showing attack patterns. You'll see exactly when someone tries to hit you and what methods they're using.

⚡ **Performance Insight:** The longest recorded attack in gaming was 16 hours back in early 2024. Now they average 5 hours but are more intense. Attackers use shorter bursts specifically to avoid detection. Your monitoring needs to catch spikes within seconds, not minutes.

# Recognizing a DDoS Attack: Warning Signs

How do you know you're being DDoSed versus just having normal internet problems?

**Sudden connection loss during competitive moments.** Your internet works fine, you start dominating in ranked, suddenly everything dies. You reconnect and it happens again. That's targeted.

**Massive lag spikes out of nowhere.** Ping jumps from 30ms to 500ms+ instantly. Normal network congestion builds gradually—DDoS attacks hit like a brick wall.

**Router lights going crazy.** Your router's activity lights are blinking rapidly or staying solid even though you're not downloading anything. It's processing the flood.

**Can't access anything online.** Not just the game—your entire internet is dead. You can't load websites, can't open Discord, nothing. That's your connection being overwhelmed.

**It happens repeatedly at specific times.** Getting hit every time you stream? Every time you play against a specific clan? That's not coincidence.

If you suspect you're under attack, check your router logs (most modern routers detect DDoS patterns). You'll see thousands of connection attempts from random IPs. That's your confirmation.

# What to Do During an Active Attack

You're getting hammered right now. What do you do?

**1. Disconnect immediately.** Unplug your router and modem. Turn off your PC. This stops the attack from continuing and gives your ISP time to notice the abnormal traffic.

**2. Wait 10 minutes minimum.** The attacker's botnet is still sending traffic to your old IP. Let them waste their botnet on nothing while your ISP's system times out and prepares to assign you a new IP.

**3. Contact your ISP.** Call support and tell them you're being DDoSed. Good ISPs can confirm this from their logs and put additional protections in place. Some will immediately assign you a new IP.

**4. Document everything.** Screenshot the threats (if they messaged you), note the time, record the gamertag/username. If you decide to report this to law enforcement, you'll need evidence.

**5. Get a VPN before reconnecting.** Don't just plug back in and hope. Install NordVPN or another gaming VPN, connect to a server, then restart your router. Your new IP is now hidden behind the VPN.

**6. Report to the game platform.** If the attacker threatened you in-game or through the platform, report their account. Include screenshots. Many platforms take DDoS threats seriously and will ban the attacker.

# The Legal Reality: DDoS Is a Serious Crime

DDoS attacks aren't pranks. They're federal crimes in most countries.

In the United States, launching a DDoS attack can get you up to 10 years in prison under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The UK's Computer Misuse Act carries similar penalties. European countries treat it as cybercrime with jail time ranging from 2-10 years depending on damage caused.

Even paying for a DDoS-for-hire service is illegal. Those ""$10 weekend stress test"" websites? Using them to attack someone is a crime. Law enforcement actively monitors these services and prosecutes users.

The FBI has shut down multiple booter services and arrested their customers. In 2024, dozens of people got arrested for using DDoS services against gaming opponents. Some were teenagers who thought it was harmless—they faced criminal charges.

If you're being repeatedly attacked, you can file a report with:

* **FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3)** in the US
* **Action Fraud** in the UK
* **Local law enforcement** with your evidence

Will they investigate every case? No. But if the attacks are persistent and you have solid evidence, there's a chance the attacker faces consequences.

# Server Hosts: Legal Obligations and Insurance

Running a game server means you're responsible for your users' experience. If your server gets attacked and goes down for days, players lose access to content they paid for. You could face chargebacks, reputation damage, or in severe cases, lawsuits.

**Get DDoS insurance.** Some business insurance policies cover cybersecurity incidents including DDoS attacks. If you're running a commercial server with paying customers, this isn't optional.

**Check your terms of service.** Your hosting provider's contract probably has clauses about DDoS attacks. Some hosts will null-route (completely block) your IP if you're under massive attack to protect their other customers. Know your host's policy before the crisis hits.

**Maintain player communication.** If you go down, immediately tell your community what's happening. Transparency builds trust. Players who understand you're being attacked are usually patient. Players who think you're just incompetent will leave.

# Final Thoughts: Taking DDoS Protection Seriously

DDoS attacks in gaming aren't some rare event that only happens to famous streamers. With attack volumes up 358% year-over-year and botnet rentals costing less than lunch, anyone can become a target. Competitive players, server hosts, and anyone with a visible presence needs real protection.

The gaming industry's explosive growth (2.58 billion players, $184.4 billion market) makes it a massive target. Attacks are getting shorter, smarter, and harder to detect. Application-layer attacks that mimic real players now account for 38% of all attacks.

For individual players, using a VPN is the most practical solution. NordVPN's combination of DDoS-resistant servers, gaming-optimized speeds with NordLynx protocol, and features like kill switch and split tunneling make it the top choice. At $3/month for long-term plans, it's cheaper than a single skin in most games but infinitely more valuable when someone tries to boot you offline.

For server hosts, professional DDoS protection through services like OVHcloud, Evolution Host, or Gcore isn't optional—it's infrastructure. The cost of going down (lost players, reputation damage, potential legal issues) vastly exceeds the cost of proper protection.

The good news? Protection works. VPNs hide your IP effectively. Professional hosts can absorb terabit-scale attacks. With the right setup, DDoS attacks become someone else's problem while you stay online and keep playing.

I have a Gran Gaggia Deluxe\* and I am pretty happy with it, I usually use pre-ground coffee from my local coffee shop and I never had problems. I usually clean the portafilter after every use, but every 3-4 weeks I fond myself opening and cleaning the bottom part since some residuals always build up. For this reason, since few days ago I got a new coffee grinder, I thought of moving from the standard pressurized portafilter to an unpressurized one. 

Has anyone of you tried using an unpressurized portafilter with this particular model? Do you have any opinion on this (go for it/not worth it)? 

And also: which size should I look for? The portafilter is 53mm in diameter in the inner part of the basket, not sure if that's the relevant size posted in the amazon descriptions.

1qbv41n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1qbv41n/ozempic_or_stomach_bug/,Ozempic or Stomach Bug?,"I started Ozempic a few weeks ago at 0.25 dose. After my 4th dose this past Friday, I’ve been having the dreaded side effects. It really feels like a stomach virus, or food poisoning so I’m not sure. But I haven’t had fever. But my bet is in the Ozempic. Is there a way to tell which for sure? Is it worth asking the doctor? And how long will these issues last? I am not taking my next shot this week because I cannot have a repeat of this. And mainly, because I have a new job starting Monday. I’ve been out of work for a year and finally landed something, and now the week before I’m sick as a dog. Totally worried about driving there, with stomach issues, being there all day with stomach issues, etc. and the job is in the office for a month for training, so clearly I have to be there. Just trying to take this as it comes, but I would love to know if  there is anything I can do to clear up the issues quicker. More water?

For these 3 weeks, my diet was not really altered, and I did have some bad choices. So I’m guessing this is what led to the 4th shot being killer. Which, OK lesson learned!! But how do I get the issues to stop?! Here is a timeline of the shots:

12/12 - felt weird stomach issues, nothing unbearable 

12/20 - didn’t feel much, occasional waves of ick, but better than first week 

01/02 - skipped week of Christmas, but this shot was also decent other than weirdness after injection 

01/09 - Friday night felt the same at first. Saturday, stomach was feeling weird and kept burping slot with that weird taste. By the nighttime, stomach was bloated, on and off waves of nausea, reflux type issues. Didn’t sleep, kept waking up every few hours. About 5:30 am Sunday, started having crazy stomach sounds and wicked diarrhea. 

This continued all day Sunday, I just kept drinking peppermint tea, lemon ginger tea, and water. Had some chicken broth at some point, half a banana dry toast. Took my about all day to eat both. 

Monday, woke up and first felt better.  Took a shower, was hungry and didn’t seem to have the bloated mess as much, made breakfast. One piece of toast with very little strawberry jam, 2 eggs done over hard eggs and more ginger tea. It felt good for a few hours, but randomly I’d get waves of nausea. I tried to ignore and did laundry, which made me feel better being productive.

Had a peanut butter & jelly sandwich about 4:30pm yesterday, and an apple, drank a Gatorade. Then about 7pm, I was hungry but had no clue what to do for dinner. So I just had a Fage yogurt. Overall, the issues  felt A LITTLE better yesterday, but still not great. 

Now it’s Tuesday, I slept pretty well. Woke up about 5:30am, felt ok but slowly stomach started feeling weird. I eventually went to the bathroom, and it was initially an almost normal BM, but then turned to the same D. I made breakfast again, 2 scrambled eggs this time with just half a slice of cheese. I put the slightest hint of unsalted butter on my one piece of toast, and had half a cup of coffee. It all seemed to go down fine. Now it’s a few hours later, and for a while I felt good, then the queasy wave comes and goes. Had another D. BM. 

I also feel weird like when you’re sick and you’re kinda dizzy, but you try to power through. I’m guessing that is just from not eating much and all the pooping. I’m driving water, herbal teach and even a Gatorade to stay hydrated. But I think I should up all of that today since I still feel like crap. 

Sorry this is so long, but I know a lot of you can relate. Any advice would be much appreciated!",1,1768319986.0,Ozempic,0,1.0,False

Hi Reddit, I, 27 F, have been in a serious relationship with my boyfriend, 30M, for almost 2 years officially. First some context

I was in an abusive relationship (let's call him Voldemort) that thankfully ended partially because of the pandemic. That man was manipulative, emotionally inept, obsessive, and jealous, liked to play the victim, etc. Think 🍇 + emotional abusive and guilt-tripping asshole.

without giving too much away, the relationship finally ended when, during the pandemic, I decided to buy an apartment for myself in the capital of my country (I'm from latam), he didn't like that and tried to guilt-trip me into backing down (I used only my money, at the time he haven't even graduated college, while I was already working, had a major degree, and was doing my master's), I guess when he tried to take my finantial and professional growth from me, that was the last straw that broke the camel's back.

This context is important, because after Voldemort my expectations on men where on the underground, I wanted nothing to do with anyone, and wanted to be alone for a while (if not forever), however, at the same time, I had recently reconected with 3 long time friends due to work, and one of those friends ended up being my current boyfriend.

Like I said, my expectations on men were on the underground, the bar was so freaking low I didn't expected even basic decency from any man, yet, after being 🍇 for so many years with the ex, and not feeling my body like my own, I wanted to recover power, so after I dumped Voldemort, one of those friends (he was single) invited me to his place during valentine's weekend to eat some pizza, playing some videogames, and having some drinks (he was also hurt from a previous relationship, he was about to propose to his GF of the time, and while it wasn't an ugly breakup like mine, he was still griefing that relationship). He told me he got what i was going through. We could drink together and let out all of those emotions about those relationships (he wasn't aware of the abusive extent of my relationship, he just thought I had the usual emotional hangover after a breakup, and wanted to be supportive while seeking company, his words, not mine).

with this I decided to take my chances, wore a mini skirt, a small blouse, heels, all that, and we started drinking and talking, he started asking how I was feeling, trying to be supportive, but I didn't feel bad about the breakup, on the contrary, I felt released, so I avoided the topic, just changed to fun small talk, until between whiskey drinks, I ended up sitting on his lap, he, while kinda surprised, didn't rejected me, and we ended up sleeping together.

We talked about what happened, the emotional state of mind of both of us, we agreed neither was ready, nor wanted a serious relationship, but the sexual chemestry was so good for both of us, that we decided to get into a FWB situation, and we stayed that way for 3 years, doing checkups every once in a while to see if any of us caught feelings (ergo, a sign to stop, take some distance and let the feelings die to resume the friendship) or wanted to persue a seriosu relationship with someone else

Then, on the second year of that FWB relationship, we went on vacation along with our friendgroup, a yearly tradition we created, he and I of course shared a bedroom and we actually arrived first to the vacation place, so we did our thing and then decided to wantch a movie, he feel sleep over my chest, and when I felt the pressure of his body over mine, it gave me a sudden flashback of the 🍇 with Voldemort, I tried to keep my cool but ended up in a panic attack that woke him up, he was of course, confused, but mostly worried, and I ended up confessing what happened to me, he was a good friend, supported me and consoled my while i calmed down, and that was the moment everything changed for me, I expected disgust, rejection, shame, but he gave me the opposite.

From that moment i started catching feelings without realizing it, and it didn't help the fact that he didn't take advantage of how low my bar on men was, but he actually raised up that bar, always being mindful about how I felt, being patient with my panic attacks, checking on me, reasuring me, letting me be independent without feeling gulthy, etc. Even when I questioned his actions, he would only say things like ""that's what a true men does"" ""you are my friend, of course I care"" and ""this is literally just being a decent human being, nothing special""

Then, when I realized what I was feeling (after a panic attack talking with my bestie, which he carried like a true MVP) I decided to check the terrain, to see if there was any possibility of him having the same feelings, or if I had to end up the FWB thing for both our sakes ultimately. long story short, he is now my boyfriend, so it all worked out lol, so we were FWB for 3 years, and together officially for almost 2

Now with that context, you can see why I love that man so much, he is truly amazing, understanding and supportive, he is super proud of my financial and professional growth and doesn't feel intimidated by it, he doesn't have a problem with a prenup (something Voldemort did have a problem with), loves to spoil me and help me out on things i don't understand without being condesending, makes me laugh, we have the same taste in music and hobbies, etc. We overall have a great chemistry after 5 years together (yes, while we were FWB, we agreed we didn't have to be exclusive, but neither was with anyone else lol).

I currently live in the apartment i brought back in the pandemic, an important part of this context is that one of the things i loved the most about the building complex was it's location, not only is near a mall and has great points for public transportation or just generally driving, it's also pretty close from my parents (15 min walk close), I have a great relationship with them, invite them often, I like to show them the things I've learned to cook since I started living alone, the building I live in has a gym as part of it's ammenities so I go 3 times a week with my mom, it also has a pool and a sauna, which my dad loves, so I invite him constantly to that; I also go to their house constantly, we play games and watch movies there. Like I said, we have overall a great relationship and wouldn't change it for the world!

My boyfriend also has a great relationship with his family, but in his case is his aunt, his grandma, his mom, and his sister (he has never lived with his dad, and it's basically the man of his household)

my BF and I have talked about what we want for the future, we both want kids (min 1, max 2), but also agree that we need to be finantially stable first, we also agree on the kind of big apartment/house we'd like to have, how we would decorate, how we'd divide the house chores, what kind of educational/dicipline methods we'd like to use on kids, etc. Our vision aligns on all of this.

We even talked about starting to live together before getting married, we agreed it was necesary, but I placed one condition: He had to invest on an apartment of his own first; part of the finantial stability we want for a future family, is to have our butts covered in case any of us losses our jobs, while we would still need to budget in that situation, having an extra property or 2 to rent is a way to enssure we would still be able to eat, live, and provide for our kids, and I don't want to be the sole breadwinner, as I am attracted to professionally ambitious driven men, the same way he is attracted to professional driven and competent women, so he agreed. That way, we would both have some sort of financial stability before marriage and before kids. In the meantime, he stays with me on the weekends, as a way to light-test co-habitation. I also placed this condition because I know it's easier to invest/save for a house or apartment while he is living with her mom, because if he were to live with me, we would split expenses, and he would have less money avaliable, he also agreed to this point, and promised me he would invest on 2026. (important note here, In latino households is very common to live with your parents until you're way older or even until you get married)

During this conversation, we also agreed on eventually getting a place close to my parents and his mother and grandmother, a middle point between the two households (this is important, as he is aware of the kind of relationship I have and want to maintain with my parents, and I am aware he is the man of his family, ergo has an important role in his family dinamic and needs to be close)

Now with all this context (sorry, that was super long), here comes the problem: I believe that we, as the young boyfriend and girlfriend, have to win over our in-laws; I have done my homework and all of my in-laws approve of me, I constantly send home made deserts to my mother in law, chat with his family whenever I'm with them, and make general, friendly conversation, and, as a result she invites me constantly to lunch, coffee, etc.

On the other hand, my boyfriend doesn't do the same thing with my parents, they have invited us to breakfast, lunch, and generally hang out (even spending 2024's christmass and 2025 new year with my family), but he doesn't do conversation with my parents, doesn't try to engage with them, is cold and distant, and doesn't even look at them in the eyes. I asked him why this was, and he just told me he didn't know what to talk about with them, so I gave him a few topics and even common interest between the 3, but nothing changed, I ended up asking if he didn't like my parents, and he assured me that wasn't the case.

Unfortunatly, my parents felt that coldness towards them, told me they feel rejected by my boyfriend, and even though he believed them to be inferior, as they didn't have the opportunity to study and be professionals like us (my dad is a cab driver, didn't even finish highschool because like is complicated, and my mom is a stayed at home mom, before that could only work as a secretary, whiile in contrast, my mother in law has a successfull carrer in a university), I assured them this wasn't the case, however, the damage was already done and they stopped taking initiative of inviting him to hang out.

I talked again with my boyfriend, and even expressed how my parents felt, he initially told me it just wasn't who he was, and even told me how his previous in-laws eventually learned he was the quiet type, but would always take care of their daughter and ended up accepting him because of it, He also clarified that he didn't think less of my parents for not having a uni degree, on the countrary, he admired how much my dad worked my ass off to put me through uni, as well as how he loves and spoils my mom so much, all because of that taxi. However, I told him it was important for me they had a good relationship, and even explained how I was putting in the effort to win his family over, and I didn't feel that effort reciprocated. This aparently made him reflect and he told me he would try more.

He did! I asked my dad to invite him to dinner during a small local celebration, and he accepted (He was clearly doubtful, but decided to give it a chance), and my boyfriend, while still not super chatty, made small conversation with them, and even gifted them a security camera as an early christmass gift (someone recently broke into their house, and we were planning to travel for christmass, so they were nervious about leaving the house alone), so they were very thankful for the practical gift.

after that we all traveled to a vacational property my parents owned, 3 hours to the city we live in, with a hot climate, pool, bbq, all the vacational stuff. I adopted 2 cats when I started living alone, and my parents have their own two cats, and travelling in the same car with all the bags and the 4 cats was impossible, as my dad's taxi is a very small vehicle, so I asked my boyfriend if he could drive me (I don't have a car and don't know how to drive), and he agreed, and my parents invited him to stay during the weekend.

My BF behaved amazingly, this time he chatted more with my parents (still not a lot, but more than the previous time, so I saw it as progress and effort on his part, which I appreciated and told him as much), even helped out my dad with some small repairs he was doing, bought icream for all of us to share, thanked after every meal and helped my mom by washing the dishes after she cooked us breakfast, lunch and dinner; My parents really liked this attitude and told me as much after he left monday morning, they told me how they still feel unsure about the unbalance on the finantial security we have compared to each other (I'm in the process of buying my second apartment, and already paid of my first apartment being younger than him), but since he doesn't have a problem with a prenup, and promised to invest on 2026, they felt more at ease, admited his attitude improved a lot and were willing to give him a chance if I was truly happy, I thanked them for giving him back the opportunity, aknowledging the effort he is putting in, and assure them they wouldn't regret it. I even texted my boyfriend later, thanking him for the effort he put in, and told him which attitudes my parents liked the most, he seemed receptive to the feedback and even bragged to our friends in the group chat, about how he was ""scoring points with the in-laws like crazy""

fast-forward to new year, and my boyfriend went back to the vacational property of my parents, to both spend new years eve, and to drive me back and my cats to the city, and here's when everything fell apart: all the feedback I gave him? completly forgotten, it was like he decided to do all the contrary of what my parents liked and approved of, he behaved horribly! not only he ignored my parents all new year, but had a cranky look the whole time (which my parents took personally, and I don't blame him, even I felt horrible and felt that he was upset with me), did not lift a dish or a spoon (he literally sat at the table waiting for my parents to pass him his plate, which is very rude in latino households), didn't thanked for any meal provided, didn't even speak with my parents, barely greeted them when he arrived, and didn't thank my father during the delicious new year's dinner (my dad started cooking at 8am, and spent all the day cooking), I whisper him in the table while my parents got up for a second to make conversation with my parents, and he answered me in a horrible and very rude tone ""Don't nag me, what am I going to talk about with them"" (I have no Idea if my dad hear him, as he was off the table but really close), he also dismissed the new year traditions we had, which my mother hated, when midnight arrived, I huged my parents, I hugged him, and he just gave me a small kiss, nothing else, it was so unlike him I felt awful, and in one moment we went downstairs to walk the dinner of, I put him apart for a little and asked him what was wrong, he just dismissed me and told me he had a hard week at work and was tired (I get having a hard week, I get those too, but I have never take it out on him or his family), he then tried to make a small joke between the two of us (trying to defuse the situation I guess), but I was still upset, and told him I didn't want to start the new year by fighting, and that we would talk later after I calmed down (we both have strong personalities and can be very grumpy, so we agreed at the very begining of the relationship that we would never discuss while upset, we would calm down first and then talk it over, this to avoid hurtful comments towards each other)

That night we cuddled to sleep and he told me he loved me and was really comfortable and happy being by my side (like his usual self suddenly returned after an awful attitude the whole day).

The next day he was good as new, back to being chatty with my parents, had an amazing and playful attitude with me (which is how he usually is) and then later when we went to swim in the pool he reassured his promise of investing this year so we could start building our future together, I was happy to have him back, but confussed on the attitude of the previous day, and my parents were even more confused by the change of attitude, they now feel him as fake and a hypocrit, they felt disrespected in their own home (I agree with this)

This is so frustrating! all the progress he made, he ruined it in a day! he gave 1 step forward and 20 back and now the concept my parents have of him is horrible, and I can't even blame them! even I felt disrespected by his attitude, I feel ashamed by him, and now my mom even told me she doesn't want to spend another christmass or new year with him, asked me to consider if I truly wanna be with him, and now they even believe he is tacking advantage of me by staying during the weekends, my dad even told me ""sorry to tell u this, but You're giving him everything easy, he now has a woman that he visits during the weekend, you feed him, and he doesn't even have to pend money on the motel because you're giving him your body for free every week"" which he apologized for how rough it sounded, but that he was also legitimetly worried about me and this relationship.

I haven't talked with my boyfriend yet, as we just got back from the trip last weekend, and I didn't want to discuss while he was driving in the highway (that can be dangerous, and I put our safety first). I plan to talk about it during the weekend, but I don't even know how to bring it up, i am genuenly so confused I don't even know what to do or how to proceed, I'd like to know if I am overreacting to all this situation, I'd like to hear ideas on how to fix it and to try and come up with suggestions to my boyfriends on how to clean this mess and do damage control, as I truly don't want to break up over this, but at the same time, this disrespectful behavior towards me, my family and my traditions can't be ignored and I can't let it pass.



How do I go about this? What can I do? Any advice on how to approach this with my BF?

How

IMPORTANT NOTES:  
\- my parents don't know about the context of the abuse with my ex, nor the FWB situation, nor how my boyfriend lifted the bar to hard for my standards in men, and i don't plan on ever telling them, (mainly because of the abuse) so giving them this context is off the table, not because they would judge me or get mad at me, but because I want to avoid the questioning, which they will do, and that would mean re-living all the details.  
\- My boyfriend's family doesn't celebrate christmass or new year (weird, i know, specially when all of us are latinos), they don't even wait for midnight, however, I contextualized my boyfriend on what we did during the holidays, and even taught him some of the games we played so we could participate, but of course, with his attitute, there were no games this year  
\- sorry again for the long post lol, but I feel all of this context is important",2,1768319962.0,relationship_advice,5,1.0,False

I was told a few months ago by a colorectal doctor that i have 3 grade 2 hems. Since then i have been eating lots of fibre, drinking at least 1.5, but aiming to drink up to 3, litres of water in order to help regulate my bowel movements which was definitely helping but something still wasn’t right. 

For the last two weeks I have had no coffee at all (I would usually drink around 1 or 2 a day) and my bowel movements are the best they have literally ever been. Up until now, my hems would often be either slightly inflamed or very inflamed and I would always be aware of them. Now, I barely even think about them. 

Anyway if you’re someone who can drink coffee, I’m jealous! but i accept that I just can’t anymore.

1qbv1b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Manifestation/comments/1qbv1b4/if_neville_goddard_had_your_bank_account_right/,"If Neville Goddard had YOUR bank account right now, what would he actually do?","So I've been obsessing over this question lately and I think I finally figured something out.

If Neville woke up tomorrow in my financial situation - like my actual bank account, my actual bills, my actual circumstances - what would he ACTUALLY do? Not in theory. Not ""just assume wealth lol."" But like... practically. Day one. What's his first move?

I used to think he'd immediately start doing SATS every night, affirming constantly, revising the account, all the techniques. But the more I read his work, the more I don't think that's it at all.

I think the first thing Neville would do is just... not react to the bank account.

Like he'd look at it, see whatever number is there, and just not give it any power. He'd see it as old news. Already done. The past reflecting back. Not his current reality.

Because his whole thing is that 3D circumstances are just old manifestations, right? They're already outdated the moment you see them. They're showing you who you WERE, not who you ARE.

So if he saw a bank account with like $147 or whatever, he wouldn't panic. He wouldn't feel like a failure. He wouldn't immediately try to ""fix"" it with techniques. He'd just... not care? Not in an irresponsible way, but in a ""this isn't actually relevant to my current state"" way.

Then what would he do?

Honestly I think he'd just go about his day assuming he's the kind of person money comes to naturally. Not as a technique he's performing. Just as a fact about himself.

Make coffee assuming wealth. Take a walk assuming wealth. Go to bed assuming wealth. The assumption isn't something he's doing - it's just his state of being.

This hit me different because I've been trying to MANIFEST wealth, like it's something I have to achieve or create. But Neville wouldn't try to manifest anything. He'd just BE wealthy in consciousness and let the 3D catch up whenever it catches up.

I've been treating my bank account like it's CURRENT REALITY and then trying to change it. But Neville would treat it like an old photograph - interesting maybe, but not relevant to right now.

Anyway I kind of worked through this whole thing and what to actually DO with this insight here: [https://youtu.be/JbBPfd-w7uE](https://youtu.be/JbBPfd-w7uE)

But my real question for this group - if Neville had your exact circumstances right now, what do you think his first move would be? Not what technique he'd use. But what STATE he'd be in. What would he assume about himself?

Because I feel like we get so caught up in the techniques (SATS, revision, affirmations) that we miss the main point which is just... being the person who has it already. In consciousness. Not as a performance.

The problem is that coffee makes my breasts hurt and I tend to get breast cysts.

What makes this really scary for me is that my mom had breast cancer, so anything involving breast pain or cysts immediately sends my anxiety through the roof. I know logically that caffeine and fibrocystic changes are common, but emotionally it’s hard to separate the two.

	•	coffee helps keep me sane and functional at work

	•	but it seems to worsen physical symptoms that already scare me

hey everyone, figured i'd share some parking tips for the iron maidens tribute show on 01/16. parking in little italy is honestly a total headache, especially on a friday night when the whole area is packed for dinner and drinks, so planning ahead is key to not missing the 9:00 pm start time.  
  
first thing i gotta tell you about is Prked. i've found this to be the absolute easiest way to park for any music box event. it's an app where people who live right next to the venue will rent out their private driveways or garages just for the night. it's usually way cheaper than the public lots and you get a guaranteed spot just a short walk away. lets you skip all the traffic chaos trying to find a spot last minute.  
  
if you don't use Prked, you still have some good options but you need to be prepared. the main thing to know is that the music box doesn't have its own lot.  
  
your best bet for free parking is trying to find a spot on the street. since the show is after 6:00 pm, street parking in the area is technically free. however, those spots will be taken up super fast, even by 6:30 pm or 7:00 pm. if you really want one of the free spots, you need to get there early, and be patient cruising india street and the side streets like kettner. even though it's free, you still have to check all signs carefully for tow-away zones and residential permit-only spots, which are definitely enforced in that neighborhood.  
  
if the free spots are all gone or you don't want the hassle, there are a ton of paid parking lots and garages around, literally seven within a block or two. the closest lots are right there on india street (like the 1304 india st. lot) and on kettner boulevard. expect to pay anywhere from $10 to $20 for the night.  
  
for a slightly cheaper, insider option, try the larger downtown parking structures that are a short walk away (5-10 minutes) but can save you cash. the columbia garage at 1050 columbia st. has good prepaid rates and is only about a 5-minute walk. you can also use other apps to reserve a space in one of the paid lots or structures in advance, which is great for peace of mind, just know it might be slightly more than paying at the gate. the 1481 india st. garage is another close one to look at for booking ahead.  
  
bottom line: plan to arrive early no matter what you choose so you're not rushing and can grab a coffee or a bite in little italy before the headliners start. hope this helps and have a great time at the show!",1,1768319189.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False

I currently work in a research lab doing image processing. My work environment is super toxic and my supervisor micromanages everyone severely. The work is boring enough and I can zone out, can covertly work on med school stuff, and am able to work flexible hours as long as it is 40 per week. No pto, no benefits. I was planning to stay until May as that is when the conference is. I submitted to it and may be doing a presentation. I've been here since August 2024 so I attended last year and it is not in a specialty field I am interested in so it's not the biggest gain but I feel like I have an obligation to go as my PI is expecting that.

Another part of me wants to leave immediately. I've gotten into 9 MDs, waiting to hear from 7 more. I've always wanted to learn different skills and think becoming a barista at a local community based coffee shop would be fun. I'm worried that 5-6 months would be too little to totally switch gears but I also think it may be a chiller work environment and potentially more flexible. 

I'm not sure what I should do. Pay is also a big factor  as I'm financially independent. Right now I make $21 an hour. I predict at a barista job I'll make maybe $13-15 + tips.

The entryway is the worst. She has at least fifteen pairs of shoes scattered across the floor at any given time. I bought a shoe rack two months ago specifically to help with this and she used it for maybe a week before going back to just kicking her shoes off wherever.

Our living room coffee table is constantly covered with her mail, random receipts, hair ties, and half empty water bottles. I’ve asked her multiple times to clear her stuff at least once a week and she always says she will but never does.

Last week I suggested we set up some organization systems and she got weirdly defensive. Said I was being controlling and that she pays rent so she can use the space how she wants. I wasn’t even being harsh about it.

I’ve seen people online talking about dealing with messy roommates and someone mentioned they found cheap organizational bins on alibaba which made me think about just buying stuff myself to contain her mess but I don’t think I should have to.

Based purely on valuation, investors from the 2024 round are now up on paper relative to the current raise. Latest reported results show $1.99M in revenue and a ~$2.8M net loss — early commercial traction with the typical burn seen in hardware + robotics while scaling.

In earlier rounds, investors backed Artly as a robotics-powered coffee concept focused on maximizing space efficiency and automating beverage preparation. Since then, the company has positioned its technology as a broader food & beverage robotics platform, expanding beyond coffee as its hardware and AI capabilities have matured.

Artly builds AI-powered robotic systems for high-traffic venues, combining robotics hardware with model-driven automation to standardize quality, throughput, and operational consistency across food and beverage workflows. The core bet is continued automation adoption in food service, where labor efficiency and repeatability matter at scale.

Key numbers from the latest filing:
- Valuation: $154.7M (Preferred Stock)
- Revenue: $1.99M
- Net loss: ~$2.8M
- Cash: ~$2.86M
- Total assets: ~$5.11M
- Employees: ~20
- Platform: DealMaker

Why this stands out:
- Meaningful valuation step-up versus 2024 (earlier investors up on paper)
- Clear evolution from a coffee-focused system toward a broader food & beverage robotics opportunity
- Exposure to long-term automation tailwinds
- Continued product iteration, including hardware upgrades

What to watch (category-level considerations):
- Robotics deployments are capital-intensive to scale
- Continued losses likely mean future raises and dilution
- Unit economics and repeatable installations matter more than demos

Questions investors should be asking:
- How many units are actively deployed and generating revenue today?

- What does unit economics look like per location once stabilized?

- How does the expanded food & beverage robotics strategy translate into revenue growth?
- What milestones support the valuation increase (margins, utilization, expansion)?

This looks like a high-upside automation play where execution details will ultimately determine outcomes.

1qbukl7,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qbukl7/mf_the_room_is_empty/,[MF] The Room is Empty,"You know it first in the quiet.

It’s not a fight, not a slammed door, not a tearful confession. It’s the silence that settles after the words have run out, a silence so complete it has its own texture. It’s the way the air in the room changes when they walk in, growing thin and brittle, as if all the oxygen has been politely withdrawn for your benefit. You learn to breathe shallowly.

You see it in the geography of the body. The careful inch of mattress that becomes a permanent chasm. The way their hand, once so quick to find yours, now rests in their own lap, fingers curled into a soft, closed fist. You notice how their gaze slides over you, landing just to the left of your shoulder, as if you are a mildly interesting piece of furniture they’ve decided not to purchase. Their eyes, once a place you could swim in, become polite windows with the blinds drawn.

You smell it on them. Not the scent of another, but the absence of your shared scent. The laundry detergent is different, neutral. Their skin smells only of soap, scrubbed clean of any memory of your touch. The perfume you bought them gathers dust on the dresser, a sweet, forgotten ghost.

You feel it in the temperature. Their skin is cool to the casual brush of an arm. Their kisses, when they happen, are careful, dry things placed upon your cheek or forehead like stamps on official documents. The warmth has retreated deep within them, banked for a future you are not part of. You become an expert in micro-avoidances: the tilt of a head to avoid a kiss, the shift of weight to prevent a hug, the strategic use of a coffee mug as a shield.

You hear it in the new vocabulary. Sentences shrink. “We” fractures into “you” and “I.” Plans become vague, fluid, dissolving into “maybe” and “we’ll see.” Their laughter, when it comes, has a startled, foreign sound, as if they’ve forgotten how to make it and are surprised it still works. The stories of their day are edited, sanitized versions, with all the interesting characters and emotions removed.

And the cruelest part? You see the want in them. It flickers in the weary slump of their shoulders at the end of a performance they can no longer sustain. It’s in the fleeting, guilty glance they throw your way when they think you’re asleep, a look of such profound sadness and trapped desperation that it steals your breath. They want the freedom, the release, the end of this quiet charade. The truth beats against their ribs like a second heart.

But they won’t accept it themselves. They are a prisoner of their own kindness, or perhaps their own fear. They are waiting for you to turn the key, to read the letter they’ve written in a thousand silent gestures, to be the villain so they can remain the one who was left. They are waiting for you to set them free, because the weight of being the one who walks away is a burden they have decided, silently, that you must carry.

So you live in the limbo of their silent goodbye. You become an archaeologist of a dying love, cataloging every artifact of its end. And you know, with a certainty that is both terrible and absolute, that you are already alone. You are just waiting for your body to catch up to the reality your soul has already accepted. The goodbye has been said. The room is empty. You are just standing in the echo.",1,1768318778.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

""…Therefore, we must go beyond studying the Word and receive the Lord—'eat' Him. For God is the living Bread. Amen.""

Min-jun closed his sermon manuscript and stepped down from the pulpit. It was the third-year preaching practicum at the seminary. Normally, a few ""Amens"" should have broken out right on cue, but only a heavy silence lingered in the classroom. The hum of the air conditioner sounded strangely loud.

The professor pushed up his horn-rimmed glasses. The scratch of his pen on the evaluation sheet stopped.

""All right. Critique begins. Who wants to go first?""

In the front row, deacon Park—who often bragged that he was ""a descendant of Calvin""—shot his hand into the air.

""Mrs. Kim, thank you for the sermon. Your sentences are strong, and your delivery is clear. But…""

He let the pause hang, then fixed Min-jun with a sharp stare.

""Your theological identity feels… unclear. 'Eating' the Lord, 'a real presence in silence'… those phrases honestly sound risky. Aren't we Protestant? Isn't it Sola Scriptura? Your sermon emphasizes subjective experience too much. It sounds like mysticism.""

Another student jumped in right away.

""I agree. And the 'bread' illustration you used—doesn't that basically lean into the Catholic Eucharistic framework? Once you start chasing God through sensory experience, it's easy to slide into superstition. Why did we have the Reformation in the first place? To recover the authority of the Word.""

The criticisms kept pouring out like floodwater. ""Too sentimental."" ""Weak doctrinal backbone."" ""The imagery overwhelms the text.""

Min-jun sat in a chair beside the platform and listened quietly to their barrage. He wasn't angry. He wasn't even bitter. If anything, a strange déjà vu crept over him—because their logic was the very blade he had swung at Do-geun only months earlier.

I used to be exactly like that.

He had believed that only the clarity of the text was truth. That mystery which could not be explained was impure. That anything sensory was dangerous. He had dissected it all without mercy.

But after passing through Job's night—and after walking through the darkness of the adoration chapel—those critiques now sounded dry and hollow to him.

""Mrs. Kim. Any rebuttal?"" the professor asked.

Min-jun rose slowly. Every gaze in the room pinned itself to him. The old Min-jun would have flushed, fired back with verses, and built a tight logical counterattack. But now he was calm.

""Your points are valid,"" he said. ""We are a people of the Word.""

He paused, looking toward the pulpit where he had just stood.

""But recently, I've felt powerless. In an emergency room where a child is dying, in front of a mother who has lost her son… the precise theological logic I learned offered no comfort at all.""

The classroom fell quiet. There was weight in his voice—truth drawn from the inside of experience.

""I'm not saying we should discard Scripture. But I wanted to ask whether, while we pour all our energy into analyzing the text, we might be missing the One the text points to—the living God.""

He looked from face to face.

""Shouldn't we become people who show God, not merely explain Him? Not waiters who recite the menu, but people who carry a warm meal to the table.""

When he finished, a few classmates snorted. Others wore faces that had slipped into deeper thought.

""…Sit,"" the professor said curtly, and the class moved on.

Yet even after Min-jun sat down, a peculiar loneliness settled in his chest.

Within the fence of Protestant theology, he had become a kind of ""foreigner."" He could not simply cross into Catholicism; he still believed in the authority of Scripture, and he could not accept a priest-centered hierarchy as absolute.

Someone who did not fully belong on either side. A boundary-walker, precariously balanced on the line between two worlds.

When class ended and he stepped into the hallway, he sensed his close friends subtly avoiding him. ""He's gotten weird lately."" ""I heard he's been hanging out with that Catholic engineer—maybe he's been influenced.""

Whispers trailed behind him. Min-jun gave a thin smile and bought a coffee from the vending machine. The coffee was bitter—yet the bitterness didn't feel unpleasant.

Standing at the boundary… means you can see both sides.

He was lonely, but at last he was free. It was the unavoidable solitude of someone who had climbed out of a narrow well and begun sailing toward a wider sea.

""Come in.""

At the knock, Pastor Choi Young-hoon's deep voice answered. When Min-jun opened the office door, the smell of theology hit him at once—books packed from floor to ceiling. Old paper. Ink. And the rich scent of espresso.

It was the ""smell of intellect"" Min-jun had admired for three years.

Pastor Choi removed his glasses and set them on the desk as he greeted him.

""Sit. I'll pour you a cup.""

The professor himself handed him coffee. Min-jun received the cup with both hands and sat on the sofa across from him.

""Rumors are thick about you these days,"" Pastor Choi began.

""In preaching practicum, you said things like 'eat the Word,' 'silence comes before language'… Word is the reports say your classmates are claiming you're caught up in Catholic mysticism. I've even heard that you've been associating with a Roman Catholic.""

His eyes were sharp, but the edge wasn't condemnation. It was concern—the vigilance of a mentor trying to keep a valued student from veering off a cliff.

""Mrs. Kim. Our Reformed tradition treats the clarity of revelation as life itself. Sensory experience and vague mysticism can easily blur the essence of the Gospel. Where do you think you're standing right now?""

Min-jun felt the warmth of the cup in his hands and thought for a moment. The old him would have insisted, ""You misunderstand,"" then defended himself by quoting Calvin's Institutes. But he no longer felt the need.

""Pastor,"" Min-jun said quietly, ""I still love Scripture.""

""Then why preach like that?""

""Because the way I love Scripture has changed.""

Min-jun met Pastor Choi's eyes without flinching.

""All this time, I've been dissecting the Bible—parsing grammar, analyzing original languages, using it as a tool to prove doctrine. But I was missing something.""

""And what was that?""

""The fingertip of the hand it points to,"" Min-jun answered. ""Scripture is a window that shows us God. But I spent my life polishing the window frame—while never really looking at the landscape beyond the glass.""

He continued,

""What I learned from my Catholic friend wasn't a set of doctrines. It was the fact that beyond the window there is reality. A faith that only reads without tasting, that only analyzes without breathing in the fragrance—can be more dangerous than we realize.""

Pastor Choi rested his chin in his hand and listened in silence.

""Isn't the Reformation's cry 'Ad Fontes'—back to the sources?"" Min-jun went on. ""I believe that source is not merely the Greek text, but the living God who gave the text. I'm simply trying to go deeper—to the source itself.""

A long silence settled in the room. Pastor Choi stared at Min-jun for a while. The words could have sounded arrogant, but there was no swagger in Min-jun's posture—only the steady composure of someone who had been filled, not inflated.

Pastor Choi gave a faint, wry smile and put his glasses back on.

""Your eyes have changed.""

""Sir?""

""Before, your eyes were full of a blue blade. Now they're like a deep well. A blade cuts—water gives life.""

He rose, walked to the bookcase, and pulled out an old volume. It was by Richard Baxter, a seventeenth-century Puritan theologian.

He placed it in Min-jun's hands.

""Read this. Protestant history has plenty of elders with warm hearts. The road you're heading toward—Via Media, the middle way—won't be as lonely as you think.""

Min-jun accepted the book with both hands. It was an unspoken recognition from his teacher.

""You haven't been 'tainted by Catholicism.' You've become a real Protestant—one who resists the shell and seeks the essence.""

Pastor Choi patted Min-jun on the shoulder.

""Go. Go and proclaim the Jesus you've met—the Jesus who is like a warm meal. Not the Jesus trapped in books… like mine.""

Min-jun bowed deeply. As he left the office, his steps felt heavy, not from despair but from weight—he had survived criticism, received his mentor's acknowledgment, and now the only thing left was to return to the most painful place: the world.

The smell of disinfectant rushed into him.

In front of the university hospital's Emergency Medical Center, Min-jun drew a deep breath. Three months earlier, this had been the scene of Job's night—the place where his theological pride had shattered into pieces. The sour, metallic air that had turned into trauma slid deep into his lungs.

But this time he did not run away. In his hands were two cans of coffee.

""…Huh?""

A man slumped on the bench by the vending machines lifted his head. It was Dr. Kim Jin-il. His hair was a mess as if he'd just come out of surgery, and he wore Crocs speckled with dried blood.

The moment he recognized Min-jun, his brow knitted.

""You again? That preacher guy.""

His voice was still rough.

""Don't tell me you came to preach 'God's will' again. I'm exhausted.""

He made no effort to hide his irritation. The old Min-jun would have flushed and scrambled to explain—or silently judged him as a ""hardened soul.""

But Min-jun said nothing. He sat on the bench beside him and slid one warm can of coffee across.

""Just… passing by,"" he said. ""I thought of you. Have a coffee.""

Jin-il stared back and forth between Min-jun and the can. He snorted, then picked it up.

""I'll give you this—preachers are persistent. So. Did you find your answer?""

""What answer?""

""The one I asked,"" Jin-il said, cracking the tab with a sharp tsk. ""Why that kid had to die. What your all-knowing, all-powerful God was doing that night.""

The question was still a dagger.

""If you're about to say 'God's deep purpose' or 'he went to a better place,' save it. I'm not interested in a useless God.""

Min-jun was silent for a moment. Only the vending machine's motor hummed.

""You're right,"" Min-jun said at last.

""…What?""

Jin-il froze mid-sip, eyes narrowing. He hadn't expected that.

""When the child was dying, God didn't grab the defibrillator. He didn't push drugs into an IV line. He didn't swoop in like a superhero to yank him back from death.""

Min-jun's voice stayed even.

""And that is why I believe.""

""Are you kidding me?"" Jin-il snapped. ""If He's useless, why believe?""

""Because,"" Min-jun said, looking at him, ""He was hurting—with us.""

Jin-il's pupils flickered.

""I saw your tears that night,"" Min-jun continued. ""The guilt, the helplessness, the grief of not saving that child… You weren't a failed doctor. You were a real doctor—because you wept with them.""

A tremor passed across Jin-il's face.

""The God I believe in is like that,"" Min-jun said. ""Not someone sitting on a high throne with arms crossed, watching. But the One who was there—at the corner of that ER, beside the mother, and beside you—weeping with a heart torn open.""

Min-jun remembered the ""God as Bread"" he had met in the adoration chapel—God who came in the smallest, weakest form to be consumed; who abandoned omnipotence and chose helplessness out of a maddening love.

""I chose to trust a God like that,"" Min-jun said softly. ""Not a strong God—but a God who stays beside us in weakness. A God who may not give us an answer… but can weep with us.""

Silence fell. Jin-il didn't respond. He just rolled the can in his hand. Beneath the rough sarcasm, a wave of something quieter crossed his face and vanished.

He lived between the obsession that he must save and the defeat that he cannot always save—and this young preacher was saying that God was present even inside that defeat.

""…You're a strange one,"" Jin-il muttered at last. But his voice had lost its blade.

""That's… pretty human.""

He finished the coffee in one swallow, then tossed the empty can into the trash. Clang.

""Go,"" he said, rising. ""It's about to get busy.""

He turned away, and his shoulders looked a little less crushed than three months ago.

After a few steps, he paused, then waved a hand without looking back.

""The coffee… was good.""

Min-jun smiled as he watched him go. There had been no brilliant apologetic. No miracle. No neat solution.

He had simply offered a ""helpless presence.""

But Min-jun knew now—this was the only ""power"" the wounded world truly needed.

He stood. In the hospital lobby, a guardian clutching a rosary and another holding an open Bible sat side by side, eyes fixed on the surgery monitor.

The scene no longer felt alien. Each of them, in their own way, was waiting for that ""helpless yet warm God.""

After parting with Dr. Kim, Min-jun descended into the lobby and paused. Late-afternoon sunlight slanted through the glass wall. In the ""family waiting area,"" people sat with stories folded into their faces.

Min-jun's gaze settled on one bench. A peculiar tableau was unfolding there.

On the left sat a middle-aged woman with permed hair. In her hand was a worn rosary, and her lips moved without rest—""Hail Mary, full of grace…""

Right beside her sat a man in black horn-rimmed glasses. A thick leather Bible lay open on his lap, and he underlined verses in the Psalms with a red pen.

A rosary and a Bible. Catholic and Protestant.

A few months earlier, Min-jun would have felt uneasy—as if this were ""truth living with falsehood."" He would have sharpened his judgments: Why does she pray to Mary instead of to God directly? Why does he obsess over Scripture even in a hospital like some legalist?

But now his eyes saw something else.

They weren't speaking to each other, but they were sitting side by side, staring at the same place: the operating room door.

At that cold door where life and death divide, denominational differences meant nothing.

Only the primal human cry remained: Save them. Help us.

They're not so different, Min-jun thought, a tightness rising in his chest.

The forms were different. The tools were different. But the essence was one—the poverty of spirit that reaches for even the hem of the invisible Absolute when pain becomes unbearable.

Min-jun adjusted the strap of his bag. Inside were still his Greek New Testament and systematic theology textbooks.

He had not abandoned his Protestant identity. He would still preach the Word from the pulpit. He would still study the text.

But his preaching would be different now—not a verdict that sorted right from wrong, but a meal. A warm spoonful given to hungry, thirsty souls like those in this waiting room.

Bzz—

His phone vibrated in his pocket. It was Do-geun.

[Mrs. Kim, are you at school? Let's grab a drink tonight. Pork belly—let's grill.]

Min-jun chuckled and typed back.

[No, I'm on my way back from the hospital. Sounds good. Soda instead of soju, okay?]

[Of course. See you soon.]

He slipped the phone away and pushed through the revolving door. Cold wind brushed his cheeks, but he didn't feel cold.

Behind him, the hospital's cross, the distant church steeple's cross, and the cathedral's cross overlapped into a single silhouette in the evening glow.

The Easter Vigil—the most sacred and solemn night in the Catholic liturgical year.

Following Do-geun, Min-jun stood in the church courtyard. It was past nine at night, and every light on the grounds had been turned off. Even the city's glow seemed cut away, leaving the yard submerged in pitch-black darkness.

Hundreds of faithful had gathered, yet it was so quiet he could hardly hear a breath. A heavy, reverent stillness hung in the air, as though the world were waiting beside the tomb where Jesus lay.

Min-jun pulled his coat collar tighter and looked around. This was nothing like the Easter services he knew in Protestant churches. No dazzling praise team. No bright stage lights. No energetic greetings of ""Hallelujah!""—only an overwhelming darkness.

To make the light stand out… do they show the darkness first?

The old Min-jun would have sneered—So this is staging, too—and dismissed it as a theatrical trick meant to manipulate human senses. But Min-jun, who had already passed through a deep well, was different now. He knew this darkness was not performance. It was the world's true face when there is no light. He had learned, in his bones, how cold and hopeless a world without God could feel.

Crackle, crackle.

The silence broke with the sound of burning wood. In the center of the courtyard, where the priests stood, flames rose—new fire, the blaze of life rekindled after conquering death.

The celebrant blessed the fire and transferred it to a towering candle as tall as a person—the Paschal Candle. Sss— the wick caught, and a fierce yellow flame leapt up inside the dark.

The priest raised the Paschal Candle high and proclaimed with a strong voice:

""The Light of Christ—Lumen Christi!""

From the darkness, the hundreds of people answered at once:

""Thanks be to God—Deo gratias!""

The procession began. The priest led, and the faithful followed—at the church doors, along the central aisle, and before the altar: three pauses, three proclamations. ""The Light of Christ!""

And each time, something like a miracle happened. From the priest's Paschal Candle to the altar servers' candles; from their candles to the first row of worshippers; then steadily to the back. The flame spread like a wave.

Min-jun stared, dazed. This was not an artificial brightness that snapped on with a switch. It was living light—passed from hand to hand—pushing back the darkness little by little, yet unmistakably.

Do-geun lit his own candle, then tilted it toward Min-jun's. Min-jun carefully brought his wick close. Do-geun's flame transferred, and warmth traveled into Min-jun's fingertips.

Ah…

He watched the small fire burn in his hand. The words of John 1 no longer felt like text, but sensation:

""There was the true light which, coming into the world, enlightens everyone."" (Jn 1:9)

Before long, the church was filled with hundreds of candles. No fluorescent lights had been switched on, yet a warm, luminous sea of gold swelled through the space—warmer and more enchanting than any stage lighting. That light touched cold stone walls, illuminated faces, and shimmered in Min-jun's damp eyes.

A strange pain tightened in his chest. It was jealousy.

As a Protestant, he had believed in the Resurrection as doctrine, and heard it through sermons. He knew it clearly in his head. But these people were seeing the Resurrection with their eyes and feeling it on their skin—experiencing, with their whole bodies, the dramatic reversal as cold darkness retreated and light prevailed.

I'm jealous.

Min-jun admitted it honestly. The sensory emptiness that the Word alone had not filled—the holy festival that praised God with all five senses—felt unbearably enviable.

This was not a show. It was a sacred re-living of that trembling dawn two thousand years ago, when the darkness of the tomb was torn open.

When the procession ended and the priest reached the altar, a majestic Easter hymn began to ring out.

""Rejoice, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels…""

Standing in the middle of that sea of light, Min-jun gripped his candle tightly. Even if their denominations differed, it was clear whom this light pointed to. And within this unfamiliar liturgy, he found himself feeling the Lord's presence more fiercely than ever.

After the rite of light, the grand ocean of candles seemed to draw a breath. The nave's lights rose softly, and the Liturgy of the Word began.

In most Protestant services, Scripture reading was little more than an introduction to the sermon—one or two minutes at most, hurried through so no one got bored. But here it was different.

Genesis. Exodus. Isaiah… Seven Old Testament readings in all. It should have felt long, but strangely, Min-jun was pulled into the slow, spacious rhythm.

The lectors at the ambo were not merely reading the Bible. Like prophets in the wilderness—or patriarchs speaking beside a fire—they were solemnly proclaiming the history of God's salvation.

The text… is alive.

These were not the ""black ink stains"" that had tormented him. He could hear the sound of creation being spoken into being, the roar of the Red Sea splitting, the rattling of dry bones rising. This was not print on a page. It was story. It was history.

And at last, after the final Old Testament reading and the Gloria resounded, the most decisive moment arrived.

The deacon, seated beside the altar, stood up. He lifted a thick volume lavishly decorated with gold—the Book of the Gospels—high above his head.

Clink, clink. Altar servers rang bells, and volunteers holding candles flanked the book like an honor guard. Ahead of them walked a thurifer with an incense thurible. Incense smoke billowed up, its sharp yet mysterious fragrance sanctifying the path the Gospel book traveled.

Min-jun watched, stunned. This was not merely moving a book from one place to another. It looked like the passage of a king.

They honor the Bible… like that?

In Protestantism, Scripture was ""truth,"" but also ""information""—something to underline, annotate, analyze, and study. Yet here, they treated it not as a research object, but as though it were a living person.

The deacon reached the ambo. He opened the Gospel book, incensed it again, bowed deeply toward it, and began, almost singing:

""The Lord be with you."" ""And with your spirit."" ""A reading from the holy Gospel according to Mark.""

In that instant, the entire congregation rose. With their thumbs, they traced small crosses on forehead, lips, and heart—resolve to understand with the mind, proclaim with the mouth, and keep it in the heart.

Min-jun rose as well, almost without thinking. That posture—standing, facing the Gospel—was not the stance of people reading text. It was the stance of people welcoming Jesus Christ, who had just entered their midst.

Ah…

He shuddered. John 1 was unfolding in three dimensions before his eyes:

""And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us."" (Et Verbum caro factum est.)

For them, the Word was not letters trapped on paper. It was reality—walking into the center of the people, escorted by candlelight, clothed in incense.

Min-jun's past flashed through him: sermons where he opened Scripture on the pulpit and dissected it with Greek and Hebrew—important work, yes. Yet had he ever, in the process, diminished the dignity of the Word itself? Had he used Scripture merely as a tool to prove his logic?

""The Gospel of the Lord."" ""Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.""

The proclamation ended. The deacon kissed the book, then raised it high for the people to see.

Looking up at that lifted book, Min-jun felt the sting of a holy defeat again. He had tried to explain the Word—but they were receiving the Word. He had tried to possess the Word—but they were standing before the Word.

I'm jealous. Truly—madly jealous.

He clenched his fist. He understood now that these elaborate, inconvenient rites were not empty decoration. They were a desperate, beautiful struggle—to make the invisible God visible, to draw the God hidden in text into the space before their eyes.

Min-jun glanced at Do-geun beside him. Do-geun stood listening to the Gospel with a calm face—nothing like the man who had suffered, saying the letters would not read.

He no longer needed to force the text into his eyes. The Word had walked to him on its own, breathing fragrance, and remained at his side.

Min-jun opened the mouth that had been shut tight. And for the first time, with his heart in it, he followed their confession:

""…Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.""

The Word that had died on his tongue was rising again.

When the Liturgy of the Word ended, the summit of the Mass began: the Liturgy of the Eucharist. On the altar were set a paten and a chalice holding bread and wine.

The priest reenacted, exactly, what Jesus did at the Last Supper—lifting the bread, blessing it, breaking it, raising it high.

""Take this, all of you, and eat of it, for this is my Body, which will be given up for you.""

Clink, clink. Bells sliced through the stillness. The white Host raised high—the ""new manna"" Min-jun had confirmed with tears in the darkness of the adoration chapel.

Min-jun held his breath as he watched. In that moment, transcending time and place, the sacrifice of Golgotha was being made present here. Heaven's table was being set on earth.

""Lamb of God, you take away the sins of the world…""

Then the priest's invitation rang out:

""Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sins of the world. Blessed are those called to the supper of the Lamb.""

At the invitation, the people rose and formed a line toward the front. It was time for Holy Communion.

Do-geun stood from the pew. He hesitated and looked down at Min-jun. An apology lived in his eyes—You still can't come with me…

Min-jun gave a bitter, small smile and nodded. ""Go.""

Do-geun stepped into the center aisle. Min-jun remained alone on the wooden bench, feeling the emptiness beside him.

One by one, the people left their seats. Only a few remained—those unbaptized, or from other denominations like Min-jun. They believed in the same God, confessed the same Jesus as Lord, yet at the table they had to become strangers.

Min-jun's gaze followed Do-geun's back as he reached the priest.

""The Body of Christ."" ""Amen.""

Hands folded, Do-geun received the Host and placed the small white bread into his mouth. He did not return to his seat immediately. He paused, closed his eyes, and made the Sign of the Cross.

From a distance, his face looked peaceful. After three years of spiritual famine—after the agony following Ji-ho's death—it was the expression of someone finally swallowing a warm spoonful of food that filled every hunger. It was not mere fullness. It was complete peace: the peace of becoming one with the Lord.

In that instant, something hot surged up inside Min-jun—different from earlier awe, sharper, almost painful.

I'm hungry.

He clenched both hands. He had ""eaten"" the Word with his heart and thought it was enough. But it wasn't. Watching them gather, break one bread, share one cup—becoming physically one around a single table—brought an unbearable hunger.

Why did we split?

The Reformation, five hundred years ago—yes, it had been necessary, a struggle to cleanse corruption and recover the Word. But the cost was that they lost the one table. Brothers unable to sit at their brothers' meal—left staring from beyond a fence, in a tragic division.

Min-jun felt an ache as if an empty stomach were twisting. It was a ""holy alienation."" And paradoxically, that alienation was teaching him how much they should long to be one.

The communicants began returning to their seats. Do-geun came back and sat beside Min-jun. Min-jun looked at him, jealousy rising again. It did not matter if Do-geun knew less Scripture than he did, or preached worse than he did. In this moment, the man who had eaten that bread and received the Lord into his body was the most enviable person in the world.

Someday…

Min-jun folded his hands like prayer.

Someday I want to stand in that line too. Someday—before that table made from your torn flesh—may every brother sit together and eat until satisfied.

A Communion hymn drifted softly through the church. Min-jun could not even hum the melody, yet he listened with a yearning more desperate than anything he had known. The sorrow of the one left behind was being transfigured into a longing for unity.

Mass ended. It was well past midnight.

In the courtyard, the air buzzed with laughter as people exchanged greetings—""Alleluia! Happy Easter!"" Plastic bags rustled as eggs and rice cakes were handed out.[1] Excited voices filled the night.

Leaving the commotion behind, Min-jun and Do-geun headed to a quiet bench in the corner of the parking lot. Each carried a small basket of Easter eggs.

Sipping a mouthful of vending-machine coffee, Min-jun looked up at the sky. A faint pre-dawn star glimmered.

""…Brother.""

Min-jun spoke first.

""To be honest, tonight I felt… miserable.""

""Miserable?""

Do-geun looked at him, surprised. Min-jun gave a crooked smile and fidgeted with the paper cup.

""Because I was jealous. So jealous it hurt.""

He met Do-geun's eyes.

""You… ate God.""

""…""

""I've spent my whole life reading God—analyzing, interpreting, explaining. I thought that was everything. But watching you swallow that bread… I realized: I've studied the menu my whole life without ever tasting the meal.""

His confession was brutally honest—the gap between concept and reality, between text and bread, and the defeat that gap inflicted.

""Right now, Jesus is flowing through your bloodstream. And I envy that—more than I can say.""

Do-geun fell silent for a moment. He adjusted his glasses, stared at the Easter egg in his hand, then spoke slowly.

""Min-jun… I was jealous of you, too.""

""Me? Of what? I'm the one who couldn't even come to the table.""

""Your fierce reading.""

Do-geun's expression was serious.

""A lot of Catholics don't read Scripture very much. We ride on the liturgy. We just take what the priest gives us, and say 'Amen' out of habit. That can be dangerous.""

He turned toward Min-jun.

""If you eat without knowing what you're eating, it can become poison instead of food. Without wrestling with the Word—without understanding—the Eucharist can collapse into superstition.""

He touched his chest.

""What made the bread I ate tonight become not mere flour, but 'the bread of life'… was, ironically, you.""

""Me?""

""Yes. These past few days, watching your anguish—seeing you wrestle with the text in pain—woke me up. It made me think, I can't just swallow this. I need to know what I'm receiving.""

Do-geun reached out and lightly gripped Min-jun's shoulder.

""Those who eat need those who read. Like flesh without bones collapses, a Sacrament without the Word can only go limp.""

Min-jun turned the sentence over in his mind: Those who eat need those who read.

It was not mere consolation. It was the moment they recognized that, though they had walked different paths, each had been the other's missing half.

""…We might actually make a decent partnership,"" Min-jun said with a faint laugh.

""You eat. I read. Later I'll preach, and you can set the table—then we'll be perfect.""

Do-geun laughed aloud. In the parking lot at one in the morning, their laughter cut through the night air. Behind that laughter, there was no longer a denominational wall, no sharp edge of theological debate—only a deep comradeship that acknowledged and respected difference as ""holy jealousy.""

""Let's go,"" Do-geun said, standing up. ""He's risen—so we should get a bowl of haejangguk or something.""[2]

""Deal,"" Min-jun said, brushing himself off as he stood. ""My treat. Tonight, I want to buy you real food—not just a menu.""

His steps felt light as feathers. The road ahead was still long, and the walls of reality were still high—but at least he was not alone.

[1] In many Korean churches (including Catholic parishes), it's common after Easter services to hand out hard-boiled eggs and rice cakes as simple festive food to share in the courtyard.

[2] Haejangguk is a rich, savory Korean soup—often called ""hangover soup""—traditionally eaten late at night or the next morning to recover after drinking; here it's just a warm, hearty meal to end the long vigil.

This is not for everyone, but it is for the one who feel pressured to eat out with other colleagues. Everyone is different, and their situations are different as well. I used to feel L when my colleagues went out to buy lunches, and I always had the standard reply ""I brought it from home"". Now I have realized the importance of it, and I feel proud of doing so. 

Apart from being more healthy, home made food helps save money and gives a message to the dictator we are dealing with here. We are not your pawns that you can use to make your friends rich, or boost downtown by making us poor.

Please give your suggestion, links etc for easy meal prep ideas.

Here is mine- Buy 3-4 lbs boneless chicken from Costco (or anywhere suitable). Chop it into smaller cubes, shallow fry in a pan, add chopped/frozen veggies (broccoli, green onion, yellow/red pepper), condiments, and finally add some teriyaki sauce to it (got a bottle from costco). Pack you meals with some white rice in 4-5 boxes for the whole week. You got your proteins, fibre and all macros covered.

I didn't expect myself to hit all my goals immediately and I guess getting this post up 2 days late is evidence enough that I have work to do. Not too happy with my consistency but hopefully laying out good groundwork and actually trying to meet goals.

# Weekly Format

**Topic:** *(Goal)* — Previous. Week Current — Notes.  Should I put this into a table format?

**Fitness**

I will be looking to run everyday and to improve my other areas listed here. I used to be more into running but have not run continuously more than 2 months at a time for over 9 years. Would love to improve this area and other general fitness areas.

* **Running:** (15:xx 5K | 2:59 Marathon) - 3 miles a day and moving up to roughly 3.5-4 miles a day this week and will be adding some light tempo work.
* **Weight:** \- 193. Down 4 lbs.
* **Push-ups:** (100) - 40. Up from 37 last week. Need to be more consistent with pushups/abs and pull-ups.
* **Pull-ups:** (20) - 7. Up from 5.
* **Plank:** (300s) - 90s. No movement

**Finances**

With the beginning of the year and a couple of birthdays and relatives in town I think i hit my spending limit pretty quick. Going to try living the peasant life for the rest of the month.

* **Income:** $4,960/month (after taxes)
* **Expenses:** Rent/utilities $1,500 | Student loans $346 + $430 | Gym $150
* **Remaining:** \~$2,534
* **Credit Card:** $10,000
* **Weekly Spend:** Since Jan 1, I have spent $1186.43. Need to spend only about $400 for the rest of the month so I can put the rest of on my CC.

**Professional**

Continued work on eJPT. Put in about 2hr a day but missed Sat/Sun because of people in town.

Would love any professional advice in this area!

* **Cert Progress:** \*will give updates/progress tracking in this area starting next week. Looks like I have about 110 hours left/70% of the course left before I take the exam. planning on doing that at the end of February so roughly 3 hours a day from here on out.

**Personal**

* **No Drinking / No Games:** I’m cutting out drinking and video games because they’re my default escape. It’s too easy to have a drink and play a round (or 20) of something like LoL instead of doing the uncomfortable work that actually moves my life forward.
* **Korean:** (TOPIK II) -Starting Korean language course on 1/20 that will meet once a week for two hours and then will having weekly assignments.
* **Chess:** (1800) - I have been studying and playing puzzles everyday. Will play my first tournament on Jan 31st. Primarily focusing on Italian Game and Scandinavian Defense as main lines.
* **Coffee:** (Pop-up goal) - It’s my dream to eventually open a cafe, and I want to start building skills toward that this year. I’m thinking of ways to track progress - should I log recipes, tastings, or small pop-up experiments?
* **Photography:** (1 photo/week?) - I want to start taking one photo per week to practice and document my skills. I’m not sure if I should post them weekly, create a personal log, or track it another way - feedback welcome on how to make this measurable and meaningful.

> *Why do you even bother messaging? You know you can't change it?*

I read the message twice before replying. My thumb hovered, then struck harder than I meant to.

*I work nights. You know that!*

The typing bubble appeared. Disappeared. Appeared again. Nothing came through.

That was the pattern now. Passing ships. Missing each other by heartbeats. Always just out of sync.

When I got home, the house smelled like coffee. Fresh. Strong. I paused in the doorway longer than necessary, letting the comfort settle. The mug was still on the counter, faintly warm when I touched it. A crescent of lipstick clung to the rim - a new shade, not the old one she used to love. She must have forgotten it in a rush.

Typical.

Her hairbrush sat beside the sink. Not tucked away, not carefully placed. Just there. Casual. Domestic. Like she’d been in a hurry. Or like she wanted me to see it.

The bed upstairs was rumpled on her side. Sheets creased, pillow indented. She’d slept there. Recently. I didn’t know whether that made me feel relieved or worse.

We’d been like this for months. Drifting. Orbiting the same life but never landing at the same time. I worked nights. She hated that. Said it felt like living with a ghost. I used to laugh at that.

Our daughter said even less. Teenagers learn silence early.

I showered, dressed, and left again before dawn. The house felt occupied, even when no one spoke. That was better than emptiness.

At work, my phone buzzed once. Then again.

> *You never listen. I’m tired of repeating myself.*

I typed back faster this time.

*I’m trying. You won’t even talk about it anymore.*

Three dots. Gone.

The arguments were always like this now—half-finished, unresolved, hanging between messages like static. I replayed old conversations in my head, trying to pinpoint when we’d started missing each other. When resentment replaced familiarity.

On my break, I scrolled back through the thread. Months of it. Accusations. Apologies. Long silences. Short replies. The shape of a marriage thinning.

When I got home the next morning, the coffee mug was gone. The lipstick mark too. I felt foolish for noticing.

The hairbrush was still there.

“Is mum still in a mood?” I asked, casually at breakfast.

My daughter didn't answer. The earbuds said all that need to be said. I shrugged and grabbed the corn flakes. 

Another night shift. Another string of messages.

> *Do you even want to fix this?*

*Of course I do.*

> *Then stop disappearing and face the truth.*

I stared at that one for a long time. Disappearing. Like it was something I chose.

When I got home, the bed was rumpled again. More deeply this time. The blanket folded around the shape of a body. Warm.

I stood there longer than necessary. Anger melting to guilt and slower still into shame. I left her there and went to the couch.

The messages grew sharper from then. More distant. More tired.

> *I don’t recognize you anymore.*

*That makes two of us.*

I slept on the couch again. Or maybe I always had.

Days blurred. Objects shifted. Evidence of her presence appeared and vanished without pattern. A scarf on the chair. Her favourite coat on the back of a door. The faint scent of her shampoo clinging to the bathroom.

Every time I reached for her—called, knocked, tried to talk—there was only silence and text.

Until one night at work. My boss let me go because my work was suffering. I walked out early, heart racing, head buzzing with how I was going to explain this to my wife.

I came home before sunrise.

The house was dark. Too dark. Quiet in a way that felt wrong. The kind of quiet that doesn’t wait for you.

I climbed the stairs, already rehearsing what I’d say. An apology. A plea. Something to bridge the gap.

The bedroom door was ajar.

My daughter was on the bed. On her mother’s side. Curled into the dent in the mattress like she was trying to fit herself into it. The blanket pulled tight around her shoulders.

Her phone lay open beside her. Glowing.

I didn’t mean to look. I really didn’t.

The screen showed a message thread from my wife to Evie. 

But the messages weren’t like mine.

> *I miss you every day.*

> *I hate that I can’t hear your voice.*

> *I wish you hadn’t died.*

My chest collapsed inward.

I scrolled. My hands were shaking too badly to stop.

> *Dad doesn’t remember again.*

> *I keep trying to remind him but he gets angry.*

> *I thought using your phone would make him remember.*

> *I sleep here sometimes. It smells like you.*

> *I miss you, mum.*

The timestamps went back months.

I looked at my daughter. Her face was wet. Exhausted. Older than it should have been.

The room tilted.

Memory rushed back, violent and unwelcome. The hospital. The call. The way the world ended and somehow kept going without asking me.

The messages I’d been arguing over. The silences I’d blamed on resentment. The distance I thought was a choice.

She hadn’t been drifting away.

She’d been gone.

And my grief—my stubborn, feral grief—had built a version of her I could fight with instead of losing.

I sank to my knees.

My daughter stirred, half-awake, confused. “Dad?”

I couldn’t answer.

On the phone, a message appeared. Bold. Unread.

One I’d sent hours ago.

> *Why won’t you talk to me?*

I understood then. And that's what scares me the most. 

I hadn’t been talking to my wife.

I’d been talking around her absence.

And my daughter had been answering.

I’ve been seeing my boyfriend for less than a year. He recently went away for work and got back last night. We spent the evening together and I stayed over. This morning he left early for work, and I slept in before heading out.

As I was leaving, I noticed four un-mailed postcards from his trip sitting out on the bottom shelf of his coffee table. Each one was addressed to a different woman. One of them was addressed to his ex and started with, “I love you and I miss you.”

I took photos of the postcards, and have each womans name and address. At this point, I feel like this is a clear betrayal and that the relationship is over. My question is less *whether* this is okay (it’s not) and more *how* to handle the next step.

How would you recommend addressing this with him? Is there anything I should or shouldn’t do before confronting him?",1,1768318061.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

You’re staring in the bathroom mirror.
You hate your smile.
You think your only options are ""looks like a teenager with metal mouth"" or ""spend a fortune on invisible trays.""

**You are wrong.**

The orthodontic industry is noisy. It’s full of marketing fluff designed to sell you the most expensive product, not the one that actually fixes your face.

I’ve dug into the weeds of how *top-tier* orthodontists actually plan treatments (specifically looking at the high-tech approaches used in Broward and Miami-Dade).

Here is the no-BS breakdown of what actually matters when fixing your teeth, and how to avoid getting upsold on stuff you don’t need.

***

## 1. The ""Fancy Braces"" Trap (Self-Ligating vs. Traditional)

Most people don't know there are different *types* of metal braces.
They assume metal is metal.

**The Old Way:** Traditional braces use rubber bands to hold the wire.
**The Smart Way:** Self-ligating braces use a built-in clip.

**Why it matters:**
*   **Friction.** Rubber bands create friction. Clips don't.
*   Less friction = smoother movement.
*   Smoother movement = often less pain and fewer adjustments.

> **The Hormozi-style math:** Self-ligating costs more. If you have a *mild* case, you are paying a premium for a speed benefit you won’t even notice. If your case is complex? It’s worth every penny.

## 2. Ceramic Braces: The ""Instagram vs. Reality""

Everyone wants ceramic (clear) braces because they think they are invisible.
They look great in photos.
**They are a nightmare in real life if you aren’t careful.**

Here is the truth:
*   The brackets are tooth-colored (Great).
*   The wire is still metal (Visible).
*   **The major downside:** They are fragile. They chip. They stain if you drink coffee or eat curry.

**Verdict:** If you are a professional adult who needs to look distinct at work, pay the extra $500–$1,000. If you are a teen or an adult who eats crunchy food? Stick to metal or go full aligner.

## 3. The ""6-Month"" Upsell

This is where people lose the most money.

You have slight crowding. Maybe one tooth is crooked.
You walk into an office, and they quote you for a **24-month comprehensive treatment.**

**This is overkill.**

A high-integrity orthodontist will look at a mild case and offer [limited treatment options](https://smile-fx.com/treatable-cases/).
*   **Wrong:** 2 years of braces for a 6-month problem.
*   **Right:** 6-12 months of clear aligners.

**Pro Tip:** If they don't offer a tiered diagnosis (mild vs. complex), find a new doctor.

## 4. The ""Invisible"" Lie

I love Invisalign. You love Invisalign.
**But it doesn't fix everything.**

If you have a severe overbite/underbite, jaw issues, or massive crowding, clear aligners are going to be slow and frustrating.

*   **Aligners:** Great for surface-level straightening.
*   **Fixed Braces:** The heavy lifters for complex jaw mechanics.

If a doctor promises they can fix a *surgical-level* jaw issue with just plastic trays because that's what you *want* to hear? Run.

## 5. Technology: Are You Paying for 1990 or 2024?

Walk into the consult. Look around.
Are they using plaster molds (the goop that makes you gag)?
Or are they using [3D Scans and Digital Planning](https://smile-fx.com/vip-tech/cutting-edge-technology/)?

**Why this is non-negotiable:**
*   **Old School:** The doctor guesses based on X-rays.
*   **New School:** Software predicts exactly how the teeth move before you even pay a dollar.

You wouldn't use a paper map to navigate a cross-country road trip in 2024. Don't use analog tech for your skull.

## 6. The ""Affordability"" Hack

People think braces require a suitcase full of cash.
Actually, the pricing model is pretty standardized if you know where to look.

*   **Insurance:** Usually covers 40-50%.
*   **The Gap:** You pay the rest.
*   **The Hack:** **Payment Plans.**

A $5,000 treatment isn't $5,000 today. It's usually $200–$300 a month. That is the cost of a few dinners out.

**Don't look at the total price. Look at the monthly leverage.**

***

## The Bottom Line

If you are in **Broward County** (Pembroke Pines, Weston, Miramar) or **Miami-Dade**, you need a specialist who isn't just trying to meet a sales quota.

You need someone who:
1.  Understands **Adult Orthodontics** (because your bones are harder than a teenager's).
2.  Will tell you **NO** if you ask for Invisalign but need braces.
3.  Uses **3D Tech** to show you the finish line first.

**SMILE-FX** hits all these markers. They don't just straighten teeth; they engineer the bite.

**Stop guessing. Get the data.**

The funeral hall's damp basement was filled with that familiar blend of incense and chrysanthemums.[1] At the center of the altar, seven-year-old Ji-ho was still flashing a playful V-sign in his memorial photo. That bright smile felt like a blade—sweet enough to twist the living from the inside out.

""…Let us begin, with a moment of silence, the homegoing service for the late child, Kim Ji-ho.""

Min-jun stood behind the pulpit and took the microphone. His black suit was neat, but the hand gripping the mic trembled faintly. The trauma of the hospital room hadn't left him.

The wake was crowded with church members and bereaved family. In the front row, Ji-ho's mother—Mrs. Kim, a deacon at the church[5]—sat in mourning clothes like someone hollowed out. The energy she'd burned through in the hospital, screaming until her throat tore, seemed completely spent; now she stared into empty air with unfocused eyes, like a shell after the soul has slipped away.

Min-jun opened his Bible. Revelation 21:4—the ""guaranteed win"" verse he'd quoted countless times at funerals.

""He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain…""

Min-jun's voice carried through the speakers. Calm tone. Precise diction. The flawless preaching cadence seminary drilled into him.

""Beloved family. To human eyes, this parting is unbearably painful and heartbreaking. But we have hope. Ji-ho has not 'ended.' He has moved—into heaven without pain, into the Lord's embrace…""

He spoke with emphasis. This was truth. The core of Christian faith. Therefore, they must believe it. They must be comforted by it. Min-jun poured out words of certainty as though hypnotizing himself.

""So do not grieve too deeply. Do not despair like those without faith. One day, we will meet Ji-ho again in heaven. Hallelujah.""

""…Amen.""

A few members murmured ""Amen"" out of habit, but their voices fell powerless to the floor.

Min-jun looked down from the pulpit. Kim did not say ""Amen."" She wasn't really listening to him. Her gaze was fixed only on the child's face in the photo. The words Min-jun poured out—heaven, hope, reunion—bounced off the thick, bulletproof glass of her grief and scattered like dust in the air.

She can't hear it.

Cold sweat slid down Min-jun's spine. Nothing in his sermon was false, yet in this room it had no effect—like expired medicine.

""Don't cry,"" ""Rejoice""—to a mother who'd lost her child, those were violence. What she needed was not doctrinal information that said ""He went to heaven."" She needed an answer for how to breathe tonight in a room where her child would not be. But Min-jun's theology didn't contain that answer.

""…Let us pray.""

He ended the message as if fleeing. Even after the benediction, his legs shook as he came down from the pulpit.

He approached Kim carefully and held out a hand.

""Mrs. Kim… please stay strong. I'll keep praying.""

Kim slowly turned her head to look at him. She didn't shout like in the hospital. She didn't rage. She simply stared with empty eyes—seeing through Min-jun as if he were transparent.

""…Yes. Thank you for your work, Mrs. Kim.""

A dry, brittle voice. Out of courtesy, she answered—and then turned back to the photo. In that brief exchange, Min-jun felt a wall as tall as a cliff. Your words don't comfort me at all. You did your part—now go.

Min-jun retreated into a corner, devastated. At the dining table, mourners ate spicy beef soup[2] and spoke in low voices. Even that ordinary bustle felt unreal.

He collapsed into a seat. He crumpled his sermon manuscript in his pocket. It felt like trash.

That was when the entrance stirred. A group in black filed in, holding long, narrow booklets instead of Bibles.

It was Do-geun. He was coming in with several members of the cathedral's young adult community.

""Mrs. Kim.""

Do-geun bowed lightly as he approached. In his black suit, he looked calmer—and heavier—than he had in the lab, and even in the hospital.

""Why are you here…? And who are they?""

Min-jun nodded toward the people behind him. Women in black mantillas. Men holding Catholic hymnals. They were unmistakably from the parish bereavement prayer group—those who pray for the dead.[3]

""Ji-ho's grandmother contacted us,"" Do-geun said. ""She's a parishioner at our church.""

""…Ah.""

Only then did Min-jun notice the hunched grandmother seated at the family section—the mother-in-law of Kim. Kim, unable to refuse her as a daughter-in-law, sat with her head lowered, exhausted.

""Mrs. Kim is barely holding on,"" Min-jun said, discomfort rising in his voice. ""Do you really need to do this right now?""

""The Protestant service just ended. If prayers from a different doctrine get mixed in, the family could be confused.""

There was a thorn in his words. In Protestant eyes, Catholic prayers for the dead were ""unbiblical"" rites, hard to tolerate.

Do-geun answered evenly, as if he'd expected this.

""I know. But for her, this is goodbye.""

""We'll keep it brief. Quiet. We won't disturb anything.""

With respectful permission, Do-geun walked toward the altar. Min-jun crossed his arms and leaned against the wall with a Fine—show me expression.

The Catholics formed a circle before the memorial photo. Candlelight flickered. A cantor began in a low, steady voice.

""Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.""

The others responded.

""And let perpetual light shine upon him.""

A chant began. Min-jun frowned. It was neither a Western hymn nor modern praise music. It sounded strangely like Korea's traditional funeral songs—almost like a lament carried by a slow drumbeat: mournful, earthy, repeating.

""I believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins… the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting. Amen.""

Each line brushed Min-jun's theological tripwire. Communion of saints? Praying for forgiveness for the dead? Judgment is over—what's the point?

His mind built rebuttals in quick succession. Unbiblical. Superstitious. This helps the dead child in no way at all.

And yet—something was off. His head rejected it, but his chest stirred.

That monotone, repetitive melody—like waves, like a mother's lullaby—kept returning, warming the cold air of the room.

Min-jun looked at Kim. She hadn't moved an inch during Min-jun's sermon. But as the chant deepened, her shoulders began to shake.

""Lord, in your mercy, hear our prayer, that Ji-ho Michael, who has departed this world…""

The plaintive melody tapped softly at grief that had petrified.

A clean, logical ""heaven sermon"" had reached her intellect. This rough, sorrowful ""song"" was touching her torn emotions.

What is this…?

Min-jun was bewildered. The prayer was wrong—doctrinally riddled with error. So why did it sound more like comfort than his sermon?

Do-geun stood in the back row with eyes closed, singing. His expression was solemn; his voice was wet with something deep. This wasn't ritual for form's sake. It was a remaining person's desperate apology and love—toward a child they couldn't save in the hospital.

""Kyrie eleison. Lord, have mercy."" ""Christe eleison. Christ, have mercy.""

Latin braided with a Korean cadence and wrapped the room. Min-jun uncrossed his arms. His desire to criticize melted away like snow, replaced by a heavy ache he couldn't name.

He had to admit it.

At least in this moment—their song was stronger.

The prayer ended. The Catholics packed quietly and left. The wake returned to a damp silence—but the air had changed. Cold despair had eased into something warmer: mourning, shared. A daughter-in-law and mother-in-law held hands and wept.

Min-jun couldn't make sense of it. Choked with frustration, he stepped into the hallway.

At the vending machine bench, Do-geun had come out first and loosened his tie.

""Have one.""

He handed Min-jun a canned coffee. Min-jun accepted it and took a sip. Sweet. Bitter. Powdery.

Turning the can in his hands, he finally spoke.

""Do-geun.""

""Yes?""

""I admit it's emotionally comforting. But… theologically, it's dangerous.""

His eyes sharpened again—the deacon returning to his post.

""Hebrews 9:27: 'People are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment.' Scripture draws a clear line—no second chance after death. So helping the dead by prayer? That violates God's sovereignty.""

His attack was precise: the finality of judgment, a Protestant axiom.

Do-geun removed his glasses and wiped them slowly on his shirt.

""Mrs. Kim… have you read 2 Maccabees 12?""

""…That's apocrypha.""

""In Catholic tradition, it's part of the deuterocanonical books. There's a scene where Judas Maccabeus offers atonement and prays for the dead—calling it a holy and devout thing to do.""

""That book wasn't inspired. That's why it was removed.""

Min-jun drew the line.

Do-geun looked at him with strange steadiness.

""Was it removed because it wasn't inspired… or because it conflicted with Luther's sola fide?""

""…What?""

""For fifteen centuries, the Church read it as Scripture. Then Luther cut 2 Maccabees to reject purgatory—and he nearly rejected James too, calling it an 'epistle of straw.'""

The words struck the bedrock under Min-jun's feet. Could the Bible in my hands have been edited by someone's theological preference? A crack ran through something he'd never dared question: the absolute certainty of ""the 66 books.""

Seeing Min-jun falter, Do-geun eased back.

""Fine. Let's set aside the canon question. Shall we talk using the New Testament you trust?""

""The New Testament? Where does purgatory appear?""

""1 Corinthians 3:15.""

Do-geun recited quietly.

""'He himself will be saved, but only as one escaping through the flames.'""

Min-jun fell silent. He knew the verse well. In Protestant circles, it was usually treated as a difficult line and reduced to something like ""a shameful salvation.""

""Is that 'fire' hellfire?"" Do-geun continued. ""No—because there's no salvation in hell. Is it the light of heaven? No—because heaven doesn't harm. Then what is it?""

Do-geun held Min-jun's gaze.

""A process where salvation remains, but something is burned away—painfully. We call that purification: purgatory.""

""Purification.""

""God is holy. Even a speck of sin cannot stand before Him. Even forgiven sinners still carry stains—habits, scars, residue. Wouldn't it make sense that these must be washed away before we can face that overwhelming Light?""

Min-jun frowned and pushed back.

""That's exactly what insults the Cross.""

His voice rose.

""What did Jesus say on the Cross? 'It is finished.' The price was paid. We are completely cleansed by His blood—so why must we be cleansed again? Are you saying Christ's salvation is incomplete?""

This was the Protestant red line: adding anything to the once-for-all atonement.

But Do-geun didn't retreat. If anything, he grew calmer.

""Then what do you think that 'fire' is?""

""What?""

""Is it some sulfurous torment? A physical flame?""

He shook his head.

""No. That fire is Jesus Himself.""

Min-jun stared, blank.

""Meeting the Holy One—His love comes down on the soul like fire. Pope Benedict XVI spoke of how Christ's gaze, the beating of His heart, becomes a healing fire.""

Do-geun's eyes reddened.

""It's not that Jesus couldn't save. It's that meeting Him is so intense—so burning—that whatever is left in us can't endure. The remnants of sin are consumed. It's pain and joy together—melting in the flames of love.""

""So purgatory isn't a penal chamber. It's the encounter itself—the moment when my filthy garments burn away as I run into the arms of the One who died for me.""

Min-jun had no answer. The fire of purgatory is Jesus Himself. This wasn't works-salvation, or a claim that Christ's merit was lacking. It sounded like something fiercely personal—an almost violent confession of Christ's love.

""And beyond doctrine,"" Do-geun added gently, ""look at human nature.""

""What do you mean?""

""When someone you love dies—you still want to do something. Feed them one more meal. Lay them somewhere warm. That aching desire.""

He nodded toward the wake.

""Does love get severed cleanly just because death happened? No—it grows. That's human nature. If God made us in His image, wouldn't that deepest instinct be something He planted?""

""Prayer takes that instinct and lifts it into God: 'Lord, my love is still here. Please take it. Please hold them.'""

Min-jun clenched the canned coffee. Do-geun's reasoning was tight—history, exegesis, and human truth. But more than that, it wasn't cold. It held grief with warmth.

""Do-geun,"" Min-jun let out a dry laugh. ""Isn't it cheating for an engineering guy to be this theological?""

""I can't believe anything I can't wrestle through,"" Do-geun said with an embarrassed smile. ""I questioned it hard before I reached this.""

Then he said, almost quietly:

""Courtroom and hospital. Protestantism often sees God's presence as a courtroom—but we also see a hospital. The verdict can be final, and yet the healing can still continue.""

Min-jun nodded despite himself. His theology had been obsessed with verdict—missing the wounded soul's recovery.

He muttered, honest and small:

""Tonight… I kind of hope that 'second canon' is true. I want God to be that meticulous with us.""

Do-geun patted Min-jun's shoulder lightly.

""He understands your heart. He reads us before He reads our theology books.""

They sat in silence.

After about ten minutes, Do-geun lowered his voice. It was softer than usual—slightly unsteady. Without being asked, he began to tell his own story.

""At home, going to Mass just felt normal. I went with my parents, got my baptismal name without thinking much, prayed the rosary… I didn't actually understand why I was doing any of it.""

He smiled bitterly.

""It was freshman year. At an engineering club retreat, some upperclassmen who were zealous churchgoers cornered me—'Mary is an idol,' 'Purgatory is a money-making scam.' And I… couldn't answer a single word. They even told me, 'You're an unbeliever—you're not saved.' That line still echoes in my ears.""

His grip tightened on the can.

""That day I felt humiliated. I wondered if the faith I'd lived for twenty years was just habit with no foundation… so I read like a madman.""

Min-jun couldn't speak. Only now did he see that Do-geun's chill had been armor.

Do-geun's fatigue slipped through the cracks.

""I read the Fathers, medieval theology, philosophy, commentaries—trying to understand Catholic faith thoroughly. But honestly… I did it because I'm weak. And when I see this kind of suffering, logic can't explain it. The doubt only grows: 'Why would God allow this?' I'm scared that doubt will collapse everything.""

Behind his glasses, he looked straight at Min-jun.

""People like me—who cling to logic—become even weaker before mystery. In the end… all I can do is cling to God. That's why I hold the rosary. When reason can't reach anymore.""

Min-jun's chest tightened. So the thoroughness was a mask for fear.

Do-geun tossed the empty can into the trash.

Clang. The clean sound rang down the hallway.

""Let's go back in. Now we really have to send him off.""

Min-jun and Do-geun returned to the wake.

Like the sea after a storm, the air had settled. Mourners were leaving one by one; the family, exhausted, leaned against walls and slipped into light sleep.

Kim still kept vigil before the photo, but she no longer looked like she might shatter at any second. She simply held her mother-in-law's hand tightly and stared at the candle flame.

Do-geun took a seat in the very back. He pulled out his rosary. This time, he didn't pray aloud. He only moved the beads in his palm.

Tap. Tap.

The faint click of wooden beads met the hush of the room. Min-jun sat beside him and watched his hand.

Earlier, that object had looked like an unbiblical tool. Now it looked different. Not a tool.

An umbilical cord—thin, fragile—linking those left behind to the soul that had crossed over.

He's walking even now.

Min-jun imagined Ji-ho on that unfamiliar road of light. Would he be scared alone? Would he glance back, searching for his mother?

Each time Do-geun's fingers passed a bead, it felt as if he were matching Ji-ho's steps—one by one—whispering, You're not alone. I'm walking with you from here.

Min-jun looked down at the Bible resting on his knees. The text was clear—but cold. Their tradition was blurry—but warm.

Lord…

Min-jun slowly closed his eyes.

He did not make the sign of the cross. He did not pray the rosary. He could not, by conscience, claim to believe in purgatory.

But in this moment, he chose to look toward the same place Do-geun was looking.

I don't believe in purgatory. I don't know if there is a fire. But Lord…

He prayed inwardly, desperate and quiet.

If Ji-ho is trembling on the way to You, please go out to meet him. Jesus—by Your warm fire—wipe away the tear tracks on that child's face.

This was not a question of doctrine.

It was human decency—for a child who had become a cold body, and for the mother who would have to bury him in her chest and keep living.

Tap.

The rosary's sound stopped. The prayer must have ended. Do-geun opened his eyes and looked at Min-jun. Min-jun opened his eyes too. Their gazes met in midair.

No words were needed. Different doctrines. Different prayers. Yet both hearts had gathered at one point: Ji-ho's peace.

""It feels warm,"" Min-jun murmured suddenly.

""What does?""

""Just… your prayer. I don't think Ji-ho will be cold.""

Do-geun didn't answer. He only gave a faint smile and held the rosary out slightly toward Min-jun—as if sharing that warmth.

Only then did Min-jun's tension finally loosen. The hospital's crushing defeat, the failure of his sermon, the doctrinal clashes—every sharp emotion softened and began to melt beneath the wake's candlelight.

Dawn was coming.

But the night was no longer cold, and no longer lonely—because two old lamps were burning side by side, keeping watch for each other.

And do you snack in between? If you do afternoon or evening snacks, are they more of a casual grab something while standing situation, or do you actually sit down and eat like it’s a mini-meal?

1qbtycr,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalWrites/comments/1qbtycr/meet_your_own_heart_before_you_try_to_share_it/,Meet your own heart before you try to share it with someone else,"We often treat love like a trophy. We act as if the main goal of life is to hold someone else's hand. Movies and books tell us this story over and over. They hint that your real life only begins when your partner shows up. But nobody warns you about what happens if you skip the step where you learn to be happy alone.  
  
If you do not meet your own soul before meeting someone else you might get lost in them. You will try to make a home inside their heart and forget that you have your own. You might think that being wanted is the same thing as being understood. That mistake will make you feel empty inside.  
  
Finding yourself is not about the fancy routines you see on the internet like bubble baths or coffee dates. It is much quieter than that. It is actually hard work. It means staying in a quiet room when you feel uncomfortable instead of checking your phone for a distraction. It involves looking at your feelings until you understand what they truly are. It is looking in the mirror until the person looking back feels like a friend instead of a stranger.  
  
This process can be messy. When you finally stop running away from yourself all the feelings you hid will come back. You will have to face your old anger and sadness. You have to sit with these feelings and listen to them or else you will just keep running forever.  
  
Love cannot fix the things you refuse to look at. People can be kind to you and stay with you(hyaa basana bhandai) but they cannot introduce you to yourself. If you do not know who you are then being in a relationship will feel like trying to read a book in a language you do not speak. You might guess the meaning but you will never fully understand it.  
  
This is why spending time alone is so important. It is not about pretending to improve while secretly waiting for a date. It is about being alone until you stop performing for an audience. This honest time alone teaches you who you really are.  
  
When you know yourself love feels different. You stop expecting a partner to save you or complete you. When you meet someone it is not a rescue mission ukus mukus bha jasto . It becomes two whole people meeting each other. You hold them because you want to and not because you are afraid of falling apart without them.  
  
Maybe the universe makes us wait for love to keep us safe. If the right person came too soon you would not have been ready. You would have asked them to lead you because you were lost. That would not have been real love. It would have just been survival.  
  
You need to find yourself first. You need to stand in front of the mirror and accept who you are and what you want. When you do this love does not fix you because you are not broken. Instead love just adds to the happiness you already have. You can finally breathe easy because you are not waiting to be chosen.  
  
So do not wait for someone else. Wait for yourself. Get used to the silence until it feels like home. Accept the parts of you that you try to hide. Get to know yourself so well that when someone finally arrives you are just inviting them into a life you already built. A soulmate should not have to rescue you. They should just meet you exactly where you are.Dherai Maya readers<33 tato pani khanu huss",3,1768317354.0,NepalWrites,2,0.8,False

I live in Houston near IAH so I usually fly United but Southwest has a major hub at Houston Hobby and my brother is platinum level or equivalent with them and uses them almost exclusively.

I recently flew from Houston - Austin - Atlanta - Pittsburgh on day 1 and Pittsburgh - Midway - Austin on day 2.  I have only one carry on and have used it for years with absolutely no issues on United, American, Delta, Northwest, Frontier, etc. On day 1 I stowed my bag in the overhead compartment with no issues apart from a gate agent telling me if it didn't fit then I would have to check it.  I agreed and when it fit we both were satisfied.  On day 2 I flew Pitt to Midway on a 737-MAX8 and stowed my bag no problem.  My connection at Midway to Austin was again a 737-MAX8 so I figured no problem.  Boy was I wrong.  For context since I was flying with my brother we were both in boarding group A 26/27 so there was guaranteed space available.  First the gate agent told me ""What are you thinking bringing a bag that big?  You're going to have to check it.""   I said well it wasn't a problem on the 737-MAX8 I just got off of 90 minutes ago. ""I don't care, that bag won't fit."". I said well it just did.  Again ""I don't care.  You're not getting on this flight with that bag."". I finally pleaded that I would normally have no problem checking the bag but that I was changing airlines in Austin and didn't want to possibly miss my connection by having to go to baggage claim and then through security again.  Just a blank stare.  Then a baggage handler stepped on front of me between me and the jetway and said ""You will check it now or you're not flying."" Now of course since I'm flying on my brother's miles and don't want to cause a scene I went to the reservation agent, got my gate check claim ticket and then boarded the plane.  The gate agent didn't even let me take it down the jetway to get it loaded, she just took it from me without so much as a thank you, etc.

TL : DR I think that Southwest employees are way too aggressive and confrontational about carry ons.  I know this is a completely 1st world problem and in the grand scheme of things is a very minor inconvenience but the whole experience left a very sour taste and in the future I don't think I will even consider Southwest even if difference in fares is significant.  Not worth it in my eyes.  Do I have a legitimate gripe or should I just zip it and move on? 

EDIT : Now that I've had some coffee and some Dunkin Munchkins I feel better and may be blowing this out of proportion.  I'm not going to file a complaint or anything like that.  I didn't demand any names or anything remotely close to that.  Maybe I was just cranky.  I am a member of AARP after all. 😄",0,1768316818.0,SouthwestAirlines,38,0.5,False

Hello everyone, 

hope everyone is enjoying their coffee. 

This is my take on the electric conversion of a manual coffee grinder. In this i used a Timemore C3S as my grinder but it is flexible with over grinders as well up to 120mm of body only length.   
I am using a 100rpm (1.2Nm) motor with a flex coupler to drive the grinder. I also designed a knocker so I knock the grinds stuck in the chute.   
Let me know your thoughts on this and if you would like me to make the designs available for u.

I just copied and pasted this from my last post. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice! But let’s pretend my wife is cool with me spending around $1500. Which grinder would you go with then? 

Kinda went the reverse way and went espresso to pour over. Haven’t used my Protitec Go in about 5 months (looking to sell if anyone wants it) and have just been using my 1Zpresso J Max for hand grinding my pour over beans (my DF54 isn’t as quality of a grind as the hand grinder). However, I’m looking to get a more quality electric grinder.

I prefer medium to medium-dark coffee (I live at 7000’ altitude so water boils at 198° anyway which makes light roasts not ideal). So for someone who prefers ~medium coffee, what grinder would you recommend for around $1500? I don’t need it to be able to grind for espresso at all.

I try to fill up on vegetables first and then I have lean protein or beans and some rice, fruit and cottage cheese. I don't have any sugary drinks during the day, just black coffee and sugar free energy drinks. I might have a little treat after the meal which is like 100 cal of small cookies.

I'm staying consistently around 240lb and can't seem to drop any weight yet. My Fitbit says I'm burning 3600-4000 cal a day. I do a walk in the afternoon to hit at least 10k steps a day. 

Should I be counting my calories better? Is it possible that my body is adjusting to starting strength training? My stomach might look a little leaner but it's hard to say and I just want to see some results on the scale for confirmation. I do eat a lot when I have my night meal but it's hard for me to think I'm eating 3k calories in one meal. My protein shake is probably 300 calories at most. Ideally I'd like to lose at least 5 lb per month. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",2,1768316627.0,loseit,30,0.6,False
1qbtmhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Kind-Claim-2577/comments/1qbtmhi/are_print_magazines_still_relevant_in_the_digital/,Are Print Magazines Still Relevant in the Digital Age?,"The rapid growth of digital media has transformed the way people consume information. News, entertainment, and lifestyle content are now available instantly through smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Social media platforms, blogs, podcasts, and video channels have replaced many traditional content formats. Amid this digital explosion, a common question continues to surface: are print magazines still relevant in the digital age?

While many predicted the decline or complete disappearance of print magazines, the reality has turned out to be more complex. Instead of vanishing, print magazines have evolved, adapted, and in many cases, repositioned themselves as premium, niche, and experience-driven products. Understanding their relevance today requires examining reader behavior, publishing trends, advertising models, and the unique value print still offers.

# The Shift from Mass Media to Intentional Media Consumption

Digital platforms thrive on speed, volume, and constant updates. Readers scroll endlessly through short-form content, headlines, and notifications. While this accessibility is convenient, it often leads to information overload and reduced attention spans.

Print magazines operate in a completely different space. They encourage slow, intentional reading. Readers choose a magazine deliberately, often based on interest, passion, or trust in the publication. This shift from mass consumption to mindful consumption is one of the reasons print magazines continue to hold value.

Many readers today turn to print magazines as a break from screens. The tactile experience of holding a magazine, flipping pages, and engaging with long-form storytelling provides a sense of focus and calm that digital platforms struggle to replicate.

# Print Magazines as Premium Products

One of the most significant changes in the print [magazine](https://www.truegether.com/category/books-magazines) industry is its move toward premium positioning. Instead of competing with free online content, print magazines now emphasize quality over quantity.

High-quality paper, thoughtful layouts, in-depth articles, and visually rich photography make print magazines feel collectible rather than disposable. This strategy works particularly well for fashion magazines, design publications, travel magazines, and niche interest titles.

In many cases, readers no longer buy print magazines for daily news but for curated perspectives, expert insights, and storytelling that holds long-term value. This shift has helped print publications maintain relevance even as digital media dominates everyday information consumption.

# The Power of Niche Audiences

General-interest magazines have faced the most pressure in the digital era. However, niche magazines have seen renewed growth. Publications focused on specific interests such as wellness, photography, gaming, sustainability, food culture, art, or independent travel attract highly engaged readers.

These niche audiences value depth and expertise. They are more likely to invest time and money in a publication that speaks directly to their interests. For publishers, niche magazines offer stronger reader loyalty and better-defined demographics, which also appeals to advertisers looking for targeted reach.

This focus on niche content aligns with modern SEO strategies, where specialized topics and long-tail keywords often outperform broad, generic content in search rankings.

# Trust, Credibility, and Editorial Standards

Another reason print magazines remain relevant is trust. In an era of misinformation, clickbait headlines, and algorithm-driven content, readers increasingly value credible sources.

Print magazines typically follow strict editorial standards, fact-checking processes, and clear accountability. Readers associate established print publications with authority and reliability, especially in areas such as journalism, finance, health, and culture.

While digital publications can also maintain high standards, the physical nature of print creates a perception of permanence and responsibility. Once something is printed, it cannot be easily edited or deleted, which encourages greater editorial discipline.

# Advertising Value in Print Media

Although digital advertising dominates marketing budgets, print advertising still holds strategic value. Print ads often receive more focused attention than digital ads, which are frequently ignored, skipped, or blocked.

Advertisers in luxury, lifestyle, travel, and high-end consumer goods continue to invest in print magazines because of their association with quality and prestige. A well-placed print ad in a respected magazine can enhance brand perception and credibility.

Additionally, print ads are not subject to ad fatigue in the same way digital ads are. Readers engage with magazines at a slower pace, increasing the likelihood that ads are actually noticed and remembered.

# The Role of Print in Omnichannel Publishing

Most successful magazines today operate in both print and digital formats. Rather than competing, these formats support each other.

Print magazines often serve as the flagship product, offering curated, evergreen content. Digital platforms extend reach through websites, social media, email newsletters, and mobile apps. This omnichannel approach allows publishers to maximize audience engagement while preserving the unique strengths of print.

Many readers discover magazine content online first and later choose to subscribe to the print edition for a deeper experience. This hybrid model has proven effective in sustaining magazine brands in the digital age.

# Collectibility and Long-Term Value

Unlike digital content, which disappears into endless feeds, print magazines can be kept, displayed, and revisited. Some issues become collector’s items, especially special editions, anniversary issues, or limited-run publications.

This sense of permanence adds value for readers. Magazines become part of personal libraries, coffee tables, and creative spaces. In some cases, older print magazines even find resale value through secondary markets and collector communities, similar to how books, records, and memorabilia are traded on [sites like eBay](https://www.truegether.com/eBayAlternative.html) and TrueGether.

# Environmental Concerns and Sustainable Printing

Environmental impact has been a concern for print publishing. However, many magazines have responded by adopting sustainable printing practices. These include recycled paper, eco-friendly inks, reduced print runs, and responsible sourcing.

Print magazines are increasingly positioned as intentional purchases rather than disposable products. When readers value and keep magazines longer, the environmental footprint per reader decreases.

Publishers that communicate sustainability efforts transparently are better positioned to attract environmentally conscious audiences who might otherwise avoid print.

# SEO and Print Magazines in the Digital Age

From an SEO perspective, print magazines play an indirect but important role. While print itself does not rank on search engines, magazine brands with strong print reputations often perform well online.

Print magazines typically produce high-quality editorial content that can be repurposed digitally. Long-form articles, interviews, and research-driven pieces translate well into SEO-optimized blog posts and digital features.

Search engines prioritize expertise, authority, and trust. Established print magazines naturally align with these principles, helping their digital content rank higher and attract organic traffic.

# Changing Reader Demographics

Contrary to popular belief, print magazines are not only consumed by older generations. Many younger readers, including millennials and Gen Z, are rediscovering print.

Younger audiences often seek authenticity, creativity, and offline experiences. Independent magazines, zines, and visually driven publications resonate strongly with this demographic. For them, print magazines represent a break from algorithm-driven feeds and a return to intentional content consumption.

This shift suggests that print relevance is not declining uniformly but transforming in how and why people engage with it.

# Challenges Facing Print Magazines

Despite their continued relevance, print magazines face real challenges. Rising printing and distribution costs, declining newsstand sales, and competition for attention remain ongoing issues.

Subscription models have become more important, but acquiring and retaining subscribers requires consistent value and clear differentiation. Publishers must balance content quality, pricing, and distribution strategies carefully.

Digital-first brands entering print also raise competition, as they bring strong online followings into the print space. This increases pressure on traditional publishers to innovate.

# The Future of Print Magazines

The future of print magazines lies in purpose-driven publishing. Magazines that understand their audience, deliver meaningful content, and offer a distinct experience will continue to thrive.

Print magazines are no longer about speed or breaking news. They are about depth, design, storytelling, and connection. As long as readers value these qualities, print will remain relevant.

Rather than asking whether print magazines will survive, the better question is how they will continue to evolve. The answer points toward fewer but stronger publications, deeper reader relationships, and a clearer role alongside digital media.

# Conclusion

Print magazines are still relevant in the digital age, but their role has changed. They are no longer mass-market products competing with free online content. Instead, they have become curated, premium, and niche-driven experiences that offer something digital platforms often cannot.

Through intentional reading, trusted editorial standards, strong brand identity, and complementary digital strategies, print magazines continue to hold cultural, commercial, and creative value. In a fast-moving digital world, print’s slower pace may be exactly what keeps it relevant.

I’ve been messing with grind size and going coarser than I used to for regular beans. I started at 60 and kept going coarser and have noticed no improvement. And I will note the recommended size on the k6 for espresso was 40 that tasted the same as what I am using now.

I’ve been doing 18g double shots, extraction time is around 28 seconds which I read is perfect for the machine. The strength setting is 2 dots so default. I’ve also been preheating the elements by running water through before running my shot.

It's such a struggle to balance life in this world. Maybe it's just me. I feel like I'm failing at everything sometimes. Work, family, friends, my babies.

Years ago my oldest daughter and I started to wake up before the sun every Sunday. The only day of the week my business was closed. The only day of the week I actually feel free. I'd put the Alexa on a Spotify playlist, and we'd dance in the golden sunlight that would slowly begin to shine in through the Southern and Eastern facing windows. We'd make coffee for me, hot chocolate for her. And we'd sit on the kitchen island, gently singing along with the music and talking together.

As she got older we started doing art projects during this time. Painting fairy doors we'd put outside in the zen garden. Making shrinky-dinks. Sometimes just sitting against the island in the sunlight watching the light fragment over the hanging prisms. I'd comb my fingers through her hair as she would tell me about her dreams.

When her sister started getting older she would climb out of her crib and join us. It was never the same but still wonderful. Chaotic. Each of us having our dedicated mugs, mine saying MOM in big block letters.

We started to miss weeks sometimes, life just getting busy, obligations getting in the way.

Nothing has ever hammered home the fact that we cannot hold onto time, quite like having children has. I cry as I fold up an outsized outfit and add it to my donation haul. I save some, folding them up tightly and putting them in a drawer where other outfits sit. A time capsule.

There's just never enough time. And, once again, maybe it's just me. But when I fall asleep at night and replay the day back through my head, I land on things that I said or did with the girls. Wondering if I'm doing the right thing, saying the right thing.

Am I messing them up for life? Do they feel unloved when I discipline them? Maybe it's too much. Sometimes I lose it yelling when I get frustrated. I try to force myself to walk away. I think when you've grown up in a very violent household, it's harder to control yourself. I notice my partner reaching his limit, yelling maybe, but not in a cutting way. He has no idea what it means to spend the entirety of your existence in battle, verbal insults thrown like a haymaker across the face. Never having enough so fighting for what you do have as though it were life and death. It sure felt like it was sometimes.

I watched a Planet Earth episode once, where baby turtles hatch out of eggs on the beach and need to immediately run into the water. Predators waiting and ready, the instinct to move and get out of there, innate.

Nothing brings childhood to light quite like parenting, either. What I experienced, what I want to do with my own kids. How to emulate being the kind of person I want to be when I'm not even sure what that is or how it functions.

In the light of a cold January morning, the earth crusted with snow, we begin again. I went downstairs to get water and by the time I got back up the girls were sitting in my bed, talking to their dad. He was answering with his eyes closed. Our youngest bouncing at the end, alternating screaming random words at the top of her lungs and cracking up. Then calling me Mommy poopie-butt over and over again, the pinnacle of three year old comedy.

I somehow get them downstairs, telling them to let Daddy sleep in. My oldest especially getting mad as she was in the middle of telling Matt an in-depth, convoluted story about what happened on her field trip a couple of months ago. She follows me downstairs, a steady stream of words and tiny-child attitude.

Outside is brighter than it should be, considering the light grey happy sky. The snow is covering everything, making it white and fresh. The girls sit and fight like they've been doing constantly lately. That's mine! No, that's MINE! over and over again.

I want to bottle this moment in time, my body feeling warm and held like a gentle hug in the light from the curtainless windows. I can smell the Japanese incense that a friend brought back for me from his latest trip around the world, burning from the dining room.

Outside the snow starts to gently fall, Bill Withers playing on the Echo Dot. I close my eyes and send a deep thank you that no matter what happens to me I have this moment.",6,1768316394.0,Life,4,1.0,False

His brain thinks you're dead.,"I once worked with a Husky who ate through drywall. Not chewed *ate*. The owner came home to a hole the size of a microwave and insulation everywhere. She was convinced the dog was angry at her for leaving. ""He knows what he did,"" she kept saying, pointing at his guilty face.

He didn't know shit. He'd been having a full-blown panic attack for six hours.

If you're reading this, you're probably at your breaking point. Your neighbors hate you. Your landlord is threatening eviction. You've tried the Kong with peanut butter. You've tried leaving the TV on. You've tried ""tiring him out"" with a morning run. Nothing works, and every piece of advice online sounds like it was written by someone whose dog's biggest problem is stealing socks.

So let me tell you what's actually happening, and why almost everything you've been told is either incomplete or actively making it worse.

# This Is a Panic Attack, Not a Tantrum

Your dog's brain has an almond-shaped structure called the amygdala. When you leave, that thing lights up like a Christmas tree and floods his system with cortisol and adrenaline. This is the same biological response you'd have if you woke up buried alive.

He's not thinking ""I'll show her for leaving me."" He's not thinking *at all*. The thinking part of his brain (prefrontal cortex) has gone offline. He's pure survival mode.

The chewing? Self-soothing behavior, like a human biting their nails during a panic attack, except amplified by prey-drive and jaw strength. The peeing? Loss of bladder control. The destruction happens in the first 20-30 minutes because that's when cortisol peaks. By the time you get home, he's been lying in the wreckage, exhausted and defeated, for hours.

That ""guilty look"" you're seeing? Not guilt. **Appeasement behavior.** You walked in stressed (because your couch is destroyed), and he's displaying submissive body language because he's already emotionally destroyed and can read your tension. He has no idea why you're upset. He just knows you are.

Stop taking it personally. He would rip apart the house whether you were the best owner on Earth or the worst. This is a broken threat-detection system, not a relationship problem.

# Why the Peanut Butter Kong Is Probably Making It Worse

Here's what nobody tells you about ""high-value distractions"": **panic shuts down appetite.**

When your dog's amygdala is screaming, his digestive system goes offline. Blood flow redirects to his muscles for fight-or-flight. Some dogs won't even sniff the Kong. Others will frantically demolish it in three minutes, then immediately spiral because the distraction is gone and you're still not back.

But here's the real problem: **Poisoned Cues.**

If you only give the special Kong when you leave, his brain learns: Kong = abandonment incoming. The thing that's supposed to comfort him becomes a predictor of the terrible thing. I've seen dogs refuse chicken—*chicken*—because it only appears before departures. You didn't create a positive association. You created a countdown timer.

Some dogs will eat because the panic hasn't fully hit yet. But you're not solving the underlying problem. You're just delaying the meltdown by 10 minutes.

Food doesn't fix fear. It never has.

# The Actual Solution: Become Aggressively Boring

Forget ""making departures positive."" Your goal isn't a happy dog. Your goal is a dog so utterly desensitized to your departure cues that watching you grab your keys is as interesting as watching you scratch your nose.

This is called **desensitization**, and it only works if you stay **sub-threshold** below the point where your dog's stress response activates. The second he tips into panic, you've lost. You're not building tolerance. You're rehearsing the panic loop.

# Decoupling Your Departure Triggers

Your dog doesn't panic because you left. He panics because he saw the *predictors* of you leaving.

Keys. Shoes. Jacket. Purse. These cues trigger anticipatory anxiety. His brain starts a countdown: ""She's grabbing her keys. That means shoes next. Then the door. Then I'm alone and the world ends.""

So you're going to break that chain.

Pick up your keys. Put them down. Sit on the couch and watch TV.

Put on your shoes. Walk to the kitchen. Take them off. Make coffee.

Grab your jacket. Hang it back up. Go to the bathroom.

**Watch your dog.** If he's fine on rep 1 and 2 but starts pacing on rep 3, STOP. You've hit his threshold. Pushing past it doesn't ""toughen him up."" It makes the association worse. Take a break. Try again in an hour with fewer reps.

This isn't about hitting some magic number. This is about **quality over quantity**. One stress-free repetition is worth more than twenty that spike his cortisol.

Do this until your dog is so bored by these actions that he doesn't even lift his head when you jingle your keys. That might take three days. That might take three weeks. The dog decides, not you.

# The Door Is Now Furniture

Once departure cues are meaningless, you graduate to the door. This is where most people rush and blow the whole thing.

Stand up. Walk to the door. Don't touch it. Walk back. Sit down.

Stand up. Touch the door handle. Walk back. Sit down.

Open the door two inches. Close it. Sit down.

**No eye contact. No ""good boy."" No treats. You are a lamp. You are wallpaper.**

The goal is for your dog to find this so boring he sighs and goes back to sleep. That's your green light to add more difficulty.

Open the door. Step one foot out. Step back in. Close the door. Go make a sandwich.

If at ANY point his ears go back, he starts panting, he follows you to the door you've gone too far. Scale back. You're not being ""too slow."" You're being *accurate*.

I've worked with dogs where we spent six weeks just on door work. Six. Weeks. Because every time the owner tried to skip ahead (""I just cracked it open for one second!""), the dog fell apart, and we had to start over.

This is not a linear process. You'll have breakthrough days where he seems fine, followed by days where he regresses. That's normal. Brains don't heal on a schedule. Respect the setbacks. They're data, not failure.

# The Affection Myth (And Why It's Cruel)

You've probably read that you need to ""ignore your dog for 15 minutes before leaving"" or ""don't coddle him, it reinforces the anxiety.""

That's horseshit.

**Cuddling your dog when you're home does not cause separation anxiety.** Love is not the problem. The problem is a malfunctioning fear response.

Some trainers will tell you that ""Velcro dogs"" are the result of too much attention. That if you just act cold and distant, your dog will magically become independent.

No. You'll just have an anxious dog who's also confused about why you suddenly hate him.

Independence is *trained* through desensitization. It's not forced by withholding affection. You can absolutely snuggle your dog on the couch. What you're working on is making *your absence* boring, not making *your presence* less valuable.

The goal is contrast reduction. If every second with you is high-intensity engagement and every second without you is a black void, that gap is terrifying. But you close that gap by training calm departures, not by being a cold asshole when you're home.

# The Timeline No One Wants To Hear

There is no ""fix separation anxiety in 2 weeks"" program. Anyone selling that is lying or dealing with mild cases that weren't true SA to begin with.

I've had dogs who made massive progress in a month. I've had dogs where we worked for four months before they could handle a 30-second absence. The severity, the dog's history, the consistency of training it all matters.

And here's the part that breaks people: **regression is part of the process.** You'll have a week of perfect sessions, then one day he falls apart at a step he mastered last Tuesday. That doesn't mean you failed. It means brains are messy.

You don't get to speed this up because you need to go back to the office next month. If you rush, you'll undo weeks of work and potentially make the anxiety worse. This is one of the few behavior issues where impatience doesn't just slow progress it actively sabotages it.

Look, I know this sounds exhausting. I know you wanted a quick fix.

But here's what I can tell you: Dogs who go through proper desensitization don't just tolerate being alone. They become genuinely neutral about it. No drugs. No elaborate rituals. Just a dog who watches you leave with the same interest he has in watching you brush your teeth.

That's the endgame. A dog whose amygdala doesn't fire when you grab your keys. A dog who understands, on a nervous-system level, that your absence is temporary and safe.

**Start today. Pick up your keys right now. Put them down. Do it again in ten minutes. Watch his body language. Stop if he stresses.**

The couch will still be there tomorrow. Your sanity won't.",1,1768316369.0,PuppyPottySecrets,0,1.0,False

I hate coffee so thats not an option at all. I havent tried many other hot drinks. 
I've been trying to get on top of my health a bit. I can get quite a lot of heartburn/indigestion and im slowly trying to figure what is mostly causing it and trying to start eating healthier foods or at least  eat  foods that agree with me more.
I gave up white bread about 3 months ago and apart from the odd burger from bk ive mostly just cut white bread out of my diet. I also was replacing milk in my tea with almond milk and that was going ok until 1 day I had a cup of tea that just tasted rank and I just started using milk in my tea again.
I feel i have some food intolerance or something but have no clue what. Anyway I really want to cut down on how much sugar I have because in the evening I'll have a cup of tea after I have a smoke and that can be like 3 to 4 cups in like 3 to 4 hours. 6 to 8 sugars is a lot for a day but thats only a few hours in the evening. I feel the sugar and the amount is probably the main culprit for my heartburn. This morning I had a cup of tea then a yoghurt a little later and ive had heartburn ever since. Enough is enough I need to start making changes but really not sure what to try. Im not up for using sweetners or anything like that.

1- Tulsa County parking is NOT FREE. The summons will direct you to park at the convention center garage, but  they will still charge you (but I've heard city municipal court will reimburse you, not the county court though).

2- You will sit in a giant room and wait for HOURS on a Monday. Hit the library next door beforehand and at lunch. Bring a deck of cards. Bring a snack or drink (they also have vending machines that take cash and cards). Bring a phone charger. You will get bored fast.

3- Enter at the corner of Fifth and Denver. Yes, where all the road construction that closed one sidewalk is.

4- If you aren't called on Monday, you will be ""on call"" the rest of the week. You don't have to show up again unless they call you and they must give 24 hours notice.

5- $50 plus mileage is the daily rate. They will also break at about noon for lunch (they do not provide food, but there was coffee available in the juror room). Fyi they said checks would be mailed as the end of the week, so don't expect immediate pay or reimbursement either :(

She once had a great career and was earning over $100k a year (in the 90s/early 00s) but got fired/blacklisted from her job and never earned that much again. She spent all of her retirement on plastic surgeries. She “retired” despite not being able to afford to and her mom just pays all her bills.

My fiancé and I are getting married soon. While talking to my SIL about wedding plans, she told me my MIL plans to move in with us after her cash cow dies to “help with the grandkids”. We’re not having children, but I guess we haven’t bee very open to his family about that. My response was “why? so we can have 2 babies to take care of?”. Like this woman has stayed at our house and literally cried when we didn’t have a pot of coffee ready for her in the morning. My fiancé said she will never live with us because it would destroy his relationship with her and he’d never support her financially because it pisses him off to have to be the financially responsible one while she blows her SS on bullshit.

1qbtgvc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_FuelOverall6269/comments/1qbtgvc/from_financial_idling_to_real_economy_empowerment/,"From Financial Idling to Real Economy Empowerment! OmniPact's ""Everything Trading"" Infrastructure Rewrites Web3's Historical Position","For a long time, the Web3 industry has been mired in the controversy of ""financial idling""—projects rush to hype concepts, funds idle in closed loops, and have almost no connection with the real economy. It was not until the emergence of OmniPact, the world's first on-chain ""everything trading"" infrastructure, that Web3 truly stepped out of the vicious circle of ""self-amusement"" and opened a new chapter of empowering the real economy.

OmniPact's core positioning is the ""trust settlement layer."" Unlike other Web3 projects that are obsessed with wealth creation myths, it solidly solves the pain points of on-chaining the real economy.

Currently, for the real economy to embrace Web3, it needs to pass four hurdles: the on-chain and off-chain disconnect hurdle, the high trust cost hurdle, the privacy leakage risk hurdle, and the non-standard asset adaptation hurdle. Traditional Web3 solutions either avoid these issues or are unable to solve them, but OmniPact has given a full-stack answer.

Its three-layer architecture of ""protocol layer + service layer + application layer"" is the key to solving the problems. The OES standard at the protocol layer translates real-world commercial rules into on-chain code, which can perfectly adapt to transaction scenarios with phased performance and multi-condition triggering. The Omni-Link oracle and X-Escrow cross-chain module at the service layer break down the data barriers between on-chain and off-chain systems, realizing the free flow of assets. The standardized tools at the application layer make enterprise access simple and easy.

Four core technologies are OmniPact's strength. Atomic settlement + non-custodial mechanism fundamentally solves the problem of default; zero-knowledge proof technology balances verification needs and privacy protection; IoT-Anchor technology makes physical asset confirmation no longer a problem. These technologies are not for show but to truly solve enterprises' worries.

Looking at the implementation scenarios, we can see how ""grounded"" OmniPact is. In the cross-border trade field, it has realized ""logistics on-chain and automatic payment collection""; in the service outsourcing industry, it has protected creators' labor rights and interests; in the RWA track, it has enabled physical assets such as real estate and bulk commodities to be traded on-chain. The cumulative transaction volume of over $500 million, 92% reduction in dispute rate, and ultra-low fee rate of 0.1%-1% all prove that OmniPact is not talking about concepts but truly empowering the real economy.

OmniPact's emergence has completely rewritten Web3's historical position. In the past, Web3 was a speculative tool for a few; now, Web3 has become an infrastructure empowering the real economy. Coffee farmers in Kenya, craftsmen in India, and SMEs in China can all access the global value network through OmniPact and enjoy the dividends of the digital economy.

The significance of this transformation goes beyond the technical level. It makes Web3 truly return to the original intention of the ""value internet"" and promotes the deep integration of the digital economy and the real economy. In the future, with the continuous improvement of the OmniPact ecosystem, Web3 will no longer be a synonym for controversy but a core engine of global commercial innovation.",1,1768316243.0,u_FuelOverall6269,0,1.0,False
1qbtgif,https://www.reddit.com/r/qatarairways/comments/1qbtgif/involuntary_upgrade_with_qatar_not_due_to/,Involuntary upgrade with Qatar (not due to operational needs),"New to this community and fairly new to QR.   
  
Recently got Silver status after some travel to Australia from London. On the return leg from Perth to Doha, I checked in at the business class counter (let’s face it, the only real Silver perk). The attendant scans my passport, picks up the phone (always a good sign, no?)  and says, “Passenger Charlie is here.” She puts the phone down and says…   
  
“Thank you for your loyalty Mr. thatoldnugget, you’ve been upgraded to business.”   
  
Never happened to me before and they need to make that feeling available in pill form, let me tell you. I overhead a fellow passenger on the adjacent desk ask how much the cash upgrade was from Y to J (PER-DOH) and she was quoted $4,500AUD which made it feel all the more sweeter. I checked the day before and Y loads were not exactly packed, but who knows.   
  
I’ve been flying with Cathay for a decade and achieved Silver and not even a whiff of an upgrade to premium economy. Not even a forced smile, though I do appreciate they’re renowned for looking after OW / status passengers.   
  
Needless to say I was delighted. 11 hours in Q Suites where I was looked after by an engaged and super friendly crew. Food was excellent (chose the Aussie chef collab menu). A burrata starter with grapes and white balsamic was sublime and the basque cheesecake strong. Signature mint tea, Arabic coffee on repeat. The entire experience was flawless (both hard and soft product) from start to finish – it’s like they know this which makes them actually want to put on a show. Maybe I got them on the right day. But when you get a lovely pre-flight rose champagne in actual full size quality stemware, you know it’s going to be good.   
  
Only negatives so it’s not completely gushy, Lounges in DOH packed to the rafters, steak on board overdone but tasty, and there’s always that 1 crew member who is disengaged and seems shocked or bewildered if you ask them a simple question. But I didn’t let that put a downer on things. The crew remarked that they always enjoy working Australia to Qatar as everyone’s so friendly.   
  
Interestingly on the Doha to London leg (a380 upper deck mini economy cabin) which was like a massive comedown – I had 2 crew members including the Cabin Service Director introduce themselves and thank me for flying with them and asking me what meal I’d like them to reserve for me. And I’m SILVER. Like what is going on?   
  
Anyway, I booked them for Japan, upgraded the outbound and have a shot at Gold. Perhaps this is the very reason why they did it? Hedging their bets.   
  
It was my first foray into airlines harnessing guest experience and tactical retention.   
  
Have any of you been treated this way as Silver or God forbid, Burgundy?

Day 1: Smooth sailing. Everything clicking into place, feeling like a miniature-building pro. ✨
Day 2: CHAOS. 😅 This was my first build with hinges (the whole side swings open!), and keeping everything square with that moving mechanism? Nearly impossible. Close the side, something pops off. Fix that, close it again, something else shifts. Rinse and repeat.
Oh, and I knocked the whole thing on the floor partway through, so add “emergency repair work” to the day’s agenda.
I was halfway through when I posted last time, and someone suggested doing the edges first. I didn’t want to restart this one, but I’m definitely planning to try that technique on my next build!
Speaking of which… Amazon had the ROLIFE Christmas Eve Party (DP005) for $15.99, so that’s up next.
I learned A LOT about working with hinges and moving parts with this one, and I can appreciate how it turned out… but this definitely isn’t my favorite. Sometimes the builds that fight you the hardest teach you the most, though!

Greer surveyed the perp. He had a large gash on his forehead and a bandaged hand. 



‘I told you no rough stuff.’ 



‘He did it to himself. He dashed back through the automatic doors and wham. They didn’t open. First time I ever saw it.’ 



‘And his hand?' 



‘Larry from the K-9 unit was bringing his dog through Booking, and the thing freaked. Took three officers to drag it off.’ 



Greer opened the interview room door. Instantly, the man jumped up. 



‘You gotta help me, man.’ 



‘You help me, and I help you.’ 



‘Make them go away.’ 



‘Who?’ 



He pointed at the glass of the mirror, showing only Greer, his deputy and the gaunt perp. 



‘The Damned!’



Greer sat, tapping his biro off his teeth as he checked the charge sheet: Theo Hermann- 23- 5,11- 130 pounds. Previous conviction for distribution of methamphetamine. Nothing about psychedelics. 



‘Nice and slow now. Tell us what happened.’



‘It started with the auction.’ 



…



Theo rarely had brainwaves, but this was a doozy. 



He hired an MC, a graphic designer, and set up a Facebook group. He even paid scraggly Mike to take care of parking. 



The auction. He’d sell every last item in the place. Cash money. 



The only problem being none of the stuff belonged to him. 



Mrs Wallace was a friend of his mom’s through the church. She lived in what was called the Big House, back when a widow who worked for the U.S. Postal Service could afford a place like that. 



The brainwave: 



He announced that Mrs Wallace had died during her annual vacation in the Keys. Her estate was to be liquidated, her possessions walking their own way out, all the money in his back pocket. 



Ornaments, pots, pans, paintings, jewellery, rugs. Anything that could be taken on the day was sold. 



Only one item made him pause– a pink mother-of-pearl vanity mirror. 



It was engraved in some weird script with a yellowed note tucked underneath. 



‘Upon sale of this mirror, the seller forgoes dominion over that which means the most to men.’ 



And Mrs Wallace had added in her own shaky hand. ‘Do not sell.’ 



Exactly what you’d write on the most valuable item in your house, Theo thought. 



He couldn’t remember who bought the mirror, but it sold, and then just as most of the bargain hunters had gone, disaster struck. 



Mrs Wallace’s taxi pulled up outside her empty house, her vacation cut short by a hurricane warning. 



‘Theo?’ She said, recognising him even with his fake, Halloween beard. 



‘Mrs W… I can… Explain.’ 



She watched as her TV was carried through the front door, yet she didn’t stop its removal. Instead, all she muttered was 'the mirror.' 



Theo tried to spoon-feed her more bullshit as they went into the house, but she was only focused on that stupid mirror, pressing him again and again. 



‘What about the mirror?’ He burst out. ‘What have I lost?’



‘It’s obvious, dear,' she sighed, matter-of-factly. 'The thing that means the most to a person… Your soul. And they’ll be watching. Watching forever.’ 



…

  


A confession like that would hold up in court even with the mumbo jumbo mixed in, Greer thought. 



The deputy whispered in his ear that the boy’s mom had arrived. 



Mrs Hermann was an old Mexican lady who wailed to the heavens at the sight of her son in handcuffs.



And then she thrust a crucifix in his direction. 



A melee. 



Theo took the necklace and then screamed as if it were flaming hot. 



The deputy was caught up in the flailing of arms and received a busted lip.



Semi-conscious, Theo covered his ears, screaming as he pointed at the mirror. ‘Leave me alone! Please, God, I’ll do anything!’ 



…

  


Greer tipped a little whiskey into his machine coffee. The Super would want this written up.



He reviewed the tape, and there he was, 15 pounds heavier than he’d like, with the deputy and Theo as the old lady was led in. 



He wrote something official-sounding on his report: amphetamine-induced psychosis. 



And then the nib of his pen halted. The light in the mirror shown in the recording didn’t move right. It wasn’t reflecting the scene. 



He paused the video, zooming in. 



In the mirror was a grimacing man with red hair and a black halo above his head. 



Greer let the video run. 



The man was hanging by the neck, silver coins falling from his palm. 



Just then, the door opened; Greer almost jumped out of his skin. 



‘I’m sorry, Sir,’ the deputy said. ‘You'd better come with me. The kid is dead. Suicide.' 



He glanced back at the screen where the visage of the man hung. 



‘You see that?’ He said to the deputy. 



The deputy squinted, and then his eyes opened wide. 



‘Is that Watkins? No, Watkins is on vacation. And there was nobody with us…’ He replied, scratching his beard. 



‘No, not Watkins. 



He wasn't a religious man, but an old childhood memory came to the fore. He crossed himself. ‘The damned.’ 



‘The damned?’



‘Iscariot.’ 



The deputy didn’t know what to say, so he slid into legalese. ‘Sir, you'd better come and confirm the time of death with the doctor.’ 



…



The boy was dead, no doubt. With some superhuman force, he’d smashed the laminated glass of the mirror in his cell and sliced himself up real good. 



Greer knelt, careful not to step in the pool of blood.  



‘There are things worse than death.’



He’d said it to himself as much as anyone else, but it was the doctor who replied, snapping on a pair of latex gloves. ‘Yeah, my wife’s cooking.’ 



Greer ignored him, closing the boy's eyes and whispering. ‘I hope your sacrifice was enough to get back, well, you know what.’   



He stood, turned, and went on his way.  



However, the question remained: who had the mirror now?

FMC - female main character

MMC - male main character

I read this maybe a couple years ago. I don’t remember if there were spicy scenes or not. There probably were? I think it was a hetero romance, but it’s possible it was sapphic. I’m going to go with the idea that it was hetero for the description.

Hopefully I’m not confusing two books…

It was a romance where the backstory was that two female best friends share an apartment, but the BFF roommate temporarily leaves. I think it’s an older, quirky apartment where things like wall outlets are tricky.

It’s too expensive for FMC and her roommate alone since they moved in around college age, so they each pay a third of the rent and the roommate’s mother also pays a third to help them out. I feel like the characters would’ve been in their mid to late twenties by the time the book took place though. FMC had no familial financial support and works as maybe a coffee shop manager?

I think the roommate’s mom is someone well respected (almost celebrity?) in her field. Maybe an author or at least someone that wrote books on their field? Anyway, it’s someone that ends up impressing the MMC when he finds out their connection, even though FMC downplays it and just thinks of her more like family. The roommate is her best friend and they grew up together. I think FMC’s family may have been unloving or just dumped her on her friend’s family a lot or something.

The roommate gets accepted into some program (post grad? Research?) overseas, and the FMC refuses to let the roommate continue paying while she’s gone and gets a temporary male roommate instead. I think the new roommate was someone she didn’t particularly get along with, but it was temporary and they both needed short term living accommodations so they went with it.

The male roommate and her do not get along at first. She’s an ADHD type that’s unorganized and a bit chaotic, doing things like baking and making noise at night. He is very structured and has a calendar to share their schedules, which she doesn’t use until later when she realizes how important things like that are for him.

There may have been a desk hutch or some furniture thing the two female roommates had never put in place because it was too heavy, and the male roommate takes care of it? That could’ve been a different book.

I wanna say they end up fake dating because he needs help deflecting his family or something? She might start her own baking business at the end partly in thanks to a well-received birthday cake she took to his family’s party that everyone loved.",1,1768315912.0,whatsthatbook,0,1.0,False

I’m hoping someone here can help me out.

I have a De’Longhi Magnifica Start LatteCrema and the red clean/milk system light stays on.
Here’s what I’ve already tried:
	•	The CLEAN cycle does run and water comes out
	•	The milk carafe is attached correctly
	•	The CLEAN function finishes automatically
	•	I fully cleaned the milk carafe and connectors
	•	The small pin/valve on the back of the milk carafe moves, but feels a bit stiff
	•	I replaced the water filter (but I understand now this light is not related to that)

Important detail:
When I had only the hot water spout attached, nothing came out during CLEAN.
When I attach the milk carafe, CLEAN works and water comes out — but the red light stays on.

So the machine seems to recognize the milk carafe and run the cycle, but it doesn’t “accept” that the cleaning is completed.

Has anyone experienced this?
Could this be a faulty microswitch or valve inside the milk carafe?
Or is there a reset I’m missing?

The screen is completely greyed out and the switch won't respond to anything. I'm so upset because I was THIS CLOSE 🤏 to finally finishing my island that I've been working on for almost 2 years. I've also been eagerly waiting for the 3.0 update so that I could finish out my island after the update. And 2 days before the update, this has to happen 🙃 I'm not so stressed about the switch itself because I was given a regular switch by someone who had upgraded to a newer one. The screen is broken on that one too (lol), but I was planning on fixing it and switching all my stuff over to that one pretty soon anyways. Everything else works perfectly fine on that one except the screen is messed up, which looks like a relatively easy fix. But now that this has happened, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to switch all of my things over to that one with my current switch not working at all.....most importantly, my island!!!

We could use a little help experiencing the best parts of your city. If I’m being honest, I’ve been on constant high alert since we arrived.

When we were walking to the arch national park, someone came up to us and asked for money with his hands in his pockets. My partner got a haircut at a barber shop and kids who had fresh hair were making gang signs and pretending to shoot air guns in the window.

Someone ran out of a car with a shattered window and was yelling about how the driver was lucky they didn’t have their gun at the time - and ran into the hotel we are staying at downtown. (ChatGPT told me staying downtown was a good idea… I’m wondering if it was wrong this time…)

I guess I just have a general feeling of being unsafe here, and I’m not used to feeling this on edge. I lived in Oakland for years. We just got back from a trip to Africa. I’m a little surprised by the cortisol flooding my nervous system. But it seems like violence or the threat of violence seems a lot more in your face and overt here?

Also, downtown is so empty - it is creepy. Are people not working in office buildings anymore? The lights are on but it’s as if there is no one home. Outside of the folks here for the convention, there’s almost no one walking to grab a coffee or lunch… We popped into Rooster for breakfast and the whole front half of the restaurant was empty.

Which neighborhoods or areas would you suggest we visit? Where is everyone?!",0,1768315219.0,StLouis,57,0.33,False

2:00 a.m. The engineering research building at S University crouched in the darkness like a massive fortress.

At the entrance, Min-jun handed his ID to the security guard, received a visitor badge, and hung it around his neck. Do-geun had left his wallet at the restaurant. Maybe the payment chaos had thrown him off—Min-jun found it later, abandoned on the bench by the vending machine. It could have waited until tomorrow, but the wallet held Do-geun's student ID and lab access card, meaning he'd be in trouble the moment morning came.

""Fifth floor, Room 503.""

Min-jun pressed the elevator button. In the seminary building, elevators always smelled like old wood and worn books. Here, in the engineering building, the air carried cold metal and disinfectant.

Ding.

The fifth-floor hallway was unnervingly quiet. But it wasn't silence. From the cracks beneath the lab doors lining the corridor, a constant mechanical hum seeped out—like the low vibration of thousands of bees hidden inside the walls.

Listening to that unfamiliar sound, Min-jun stopped in front of Room 503. The door was steel—a fire door—with a small window to see inside. He raised his hand to knock, hesitated, and peered through the glass first.

""…""

It was another world.

Fluorescent lights glared pale from the ceiling. Along one wall, black server racks filled the room—green and red LEDs blinking like madness.

Whirr— whirr—

Cooling fans roared loudly enough to reach him through the glass, like the breathing of a giant mechanical beast. There was no human warmth to be found—only data and electrical signals, alive and moving inside a cold sanctuary.

And at the center stood Lee Do-geun.

Buried at a cramped desk. The neat cardigan he'd worn at the debate was nowhere to be seen. His shirt sleeves were rolled up; his tie lay loosened on the desk like a dead snake. Empty cup-noodle containers and crushed energy-drink cans were stacked precariously.

Do-geun stared at three monitors at once. His fingers ran nonstop over the keyboard.

Tap-tap, tap, ta-tap—

The sound was like machine-gun bursts—or the desperate footsteps of someone being chased.

Min-jun froze with his hand on the doorknob. He remembered Do-geun's bitter smile outside the restaurant, when he'd said, ""I'm just hanging on too.""

What was Do-geun fighting in there?

The invisible God?

Or an equation the world refused to solve?

Knock, knock.

Min-jun tapped the door carefully, then harder so the sound wouldn't be swallowed by the machines.

Bang, bang.

Only then did Do-geun's shoulder twitch. Slowly, he turned his head toward the door. His eyes behind the glasses were hollowed out. Bloodshot pupils took a few seconds to recognize Min-jun.

""…Ah.""

Do-geun opened the door with a vacant expression. The lab's mechanical roar poured into the hallway. Up close, his condition was worse than Min-jun expected. Dark circles sat deep under his eyes, and his shirt buttons were misaligned. The sharp, brilliant engineer from earlier was gone.

""Min-jun…? How did you—""

""You dropped your wallet. Your student ID's in here too, so I figured you'd be stuck tomorrow morning.""

Min-jun held out the leather wallet. Do-geun patted his back pocket and only then realized it was missing. He let out a hollow laugh.

""My head was somewhere else. Thank you. Come in—have some tea or something…""

Do-geun swayed as he stepped aside. Min-jun entered the lab with awkward caution.

The air inside was dry—stripped bare of moisture, abrasive against his nose. The cooling fans' low roar pressed against his ears from every direction.

""Noisy, isn't it? I'm running the servers.""

Do-geun pulled out a chair and cleared a pile of papers spread across the desk. The pages were packed with complex equations and graphs Min-jun couldn't begin to decipher.

""Are you working through the night?""

Min-jun asked, pointing at the monitors. Thousands of lines of data streamed down the screens like a waterfall.

""Yes. I have calculations I have to finish by the end of this month.""

Do-geun opened a canned coffee and handed it to Min-jun, then dropped into his own chair with a thud. Out of habit, he removed his glasses and rubbed the lenses against his shirt hem.

""It's the process of controlling every variable in the model to find the optimal value.""

He put his glasses back on and fixed his eyes on the screen. Deep fatigue lay there—and something else: tense, irritable obsession.

""But I can't get the result. The error keeps showing up. It's tiny—0.01%—but… it collapses the whole system.""

""0.01%… isn't that something you can just ignore?""

Do-geun shook his head.

""No. In engineering, error is failure. There's no outcome without a cause. There's definitely a reason somewhere, but no matter how I tear the code apart, I can't see it.""

He stared down at the blinking cursor as if trying to find a devil hiding inside the screen.

""It's funny. I can't even control a single computer in this little room…""

He muttered with self-mockery.

""And I had the nerve to think I could understand the One who made the universe.""

Min-jun paused with the coffee half-raised. Do-geun's struggle wasn't simply frustration at a stalled project. Even inside this lab, he was witnessing the collapse of the very causality he trusted—an error with no visible source, a variable he couldn't control. It resembled the absurdity he'd named outside the lab: suffering, death.

""Brother.""

Min-jun called quietly.

""Yes.""

""That error… maybe it's something that was always there.""

""What do you mean…?""

""Machines make noise when they get old. Wires build resistance. Maybe the world is just built like that—never perfectly clean. Never perfectly exact.""

At Min-jun's blunt attempt at comfort, Do-geun stared at him blankly. For someone who believed there had to be a correct answer, Min-jun's ""maybe that's just how it is"" sounded foreign—yet strangely convincing.

""…Right. Maybe it really is built like that. Then why did I keep trying to force everything to fit?""

Do-geun's shoulders slumped. It felt like a bowstring pulled tight for too long finally snapping loose.

Only then did Min-jun notice something on the corner of the desk—something oddly out of place among cutting-edge servers and pages of equations.

Min-jun's eyes settled near Do-geun's keyboard. Between the mechanical keyboard, the mouse, and tangled cables, one object carried a color that didn't belong there.

An old wooden rosary.

The varnish on the beads had worn away and turned glossy from years of handling, and the cross had darkened with skin-oil and time. Beside a supercomputer processing billions of operations per second sat a purely analog tool—wood carved into simple shapes.

The mismatch felt uncanny.

""This… doesn't really match.""

Min-jun tipped his chin toward the rosary.

""Not in here.""

Do-geun followed his gaze, then embarrassed, tried to tuck the rosary into his pocket.

""Ah. It's a habit. When my head gets crowded, holding it helps me calm down.""

""Do you pray too? In all this noise?""

""Sometimes. When the code jams, or when I can't find an answer no matter what.""

Do-geun toyed with the beads.

""You know… engineering is dry. It's all logic. But even if you push logic to its limit, sometimes it won't open up. Like that error I mentioned.""

His face darkened again. He was slipping back into the swamp of cause and effect.

""The world is imperfect. My code, my faith. So I keep asking—what is Your providence? What am I missing…?""

Do-geun stared again at the red error message on the monitor. His eyes looked urgent, almost angry—like the cry of a thinker who desperately wanted God to be understandable.

Min-jun folded his arms and watched him. Then, abruptly, he spoke.

""Brother.""

""Yes?""

""You live an exhausting life.""

""…Excuse me?""

Do-geun's eyes widened at the unexpected line. Min-jun looked straight into Do-geun's eyes, not the monitor.

""Do you have to understand God with your head in order to believe?""

""That's… if you don't understand, you can't be sure. Blind faith is dangerous.""

""No. I think you're trying to grade God.""

At Min-jun's words, Do-geun's mouth closed.

""If God fits neatly inside my head, then He's smaller than me. What use is a god like that?""

Min-jun pointed to the rosary.

""That wooden rosary—you're not holding it because you understand it. You're holding it because you're suffocating. Because you're clinging to it and begging to be saved.""

""…""

""I don't know engineering. But faith isn't calculation.""

He paused.

""It's surrender.""

It was a blunt strike. No technical theology, no polished metaphor—just a straight line. And it severed Do-geun's tangled logical circuit in one motion.

Do-geun stared, then let out a small, helpless laugh.

""…That hurts.""

He took off his glasses and set them on the desk, then covered his face with both hands.

""Grading Him… that's right. I guess I didn't know my place.""

Moisture clung to Do-geun's voice leaking through his fingers. It sounded like a declaration of defeat—and at the same time, the first breath of relief from brutal compulsion.

Only then did Min-jun loosen the tension in his own shoulders. In the cold noise of the servers, a warm silence finally flowed between them for the first time.

Do-geun rubbed his face for a long while, then breathed out deeply—as if the poisonous fatigue stored in his body was leaving with it.

""…Do you want another coffee? It's just instant mix.""

He started to rise.

""No. I'll make it. Sit down for a bit.""

Min-jun waved him off and headed toward the small kitchenette. Torn instant-coffee packets and paper cups were scattered messily by the water dispenser. Even Lee Do-geun, for all his brilliance, lived like a typical student living alone.

Min-jun poured hot water into two paper cups. A sweet aroma rose, softening the lab air that had been saturated with cold metal.

""Here.""

Min-jun set the steaming cup down on Do-geun's desk.

""Thank you.""

Do-geun wrapped both hands around it. As warmth seeped into his fingertips, a faint trace of color returned to his pale face.

He didn't drink right away. Instead, he picked up the rosary again. This time he didn't hide it. He gripped the beads firmly in his left hand and took the mouse in his right.

""Like you said… I should surrender and try again.""

Do-geun gave a wry smile at the monitor.

""Once I admit it, I feel a little lighter. If an error happens, let it happen. I should accept that as my limit.""

""…Don't push yourself too hard. God rested one day out of seven.""

""Yes. I'll try.""

Do-geun turned his eyes back to the equations on the screen. But he wasn't glaring like he wanted to devour them anymore. His gaze was calmer, more observant.

Whirr— whirr—

The cooling fans still roared; red LEDs still blinked like warning lights. In the middle of that forest of cold machinery, Do-geun's back—holding an old wooden rosary—looked both oddly out of place and strangely steady.

Cold iron and warm wood. Fierce reason and rough faith.

Do-geun was balancing between the two extremes—precariously, yet desperately.

Min-jun sipped his coffee and watched him. The obnoxious elite engineer from their first meeting was gone. In his place was a fragile human being, fighting his own limits and clinging to God for life…Just like me.

Min-jun murmured inwardly.

""Brother.""

He set his cup down and spoke as if on impulse.

""Are you free this weekend?""

""Huh? Why?""

Do-geun stopped the mouse and looked back.

""Let's go there once. That church you attend.""

""Church?""

Do-geun looked surprised.

""Why all of a sudden? You said it was a hotbed of idolatry.""

He asked with a teasing grin. Min-jun tipped his chin toward the old rosary on the desk.

""I'm curious. You're hanging on in this barren lab with nothing but that wooden rosary… so I'm wondering what's at the 'home base.'""

Min-jun crossed his arms and added with deliberate gruffness.

""I need to check it for myself—whether your faith is real, or whether you're just intoxicated by atmosphere.""

""Ah… You're going to verify it?""

Do-geun's eyes curved into crescents.

""Fine. Honestly, I've been bored going alone. Welcome, Min-jun.""

""Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not going to pray. I'm going to analyze it critically.""

""Yes, yes. How scary. I'd better prepare properly if I'm hosting you.""

Do-geun chuckled and turned back to the monitor. Min-jun crushed the empty paper cup and tossed it into the trash.

Walking back out, the hallway's machine hum was still loud—but Min-jun's steps felt lighter than when he'd come.

""All right, all right! Tight in here—fill in from the inside, everyone!""

In front of the university's main gate: ""Original Grandma's Sundaeguk."" The moment the sliding door opened, loud chatter and the rich, slightly pungent smell of pork broth rushed out.

The afterparty seating was divided with surgical clarity.

The two tables near the entrance were what people jokingly called the ""Living Water of the Spirit"" camp—Protestant seminarians and conservative-denomination professors. Their tables held only bottles of Chilsung Cider[1] and cola, wholesome and orderly. Pastor Choi Young-hoon sat right in the middle, lifting his glass of soda with warm words.

Meanwhile, three tables deeper inside were the ""Grain Liquor"" camp—Catholic students, professors from the general graduate school, and a few students from progressive denominations who were lenient about alcohol. Green soju[2] bottles and brown beer bottles clinked loudly.

""Everyone worked hard—have a drink!"" ""Cheers!""

Min-jun frowned at the scene. Alcohol at a theological debate afterparty. Something he could never get used to—no, something he found hard to accept. Naturally, he tried to settle himself at the end of the ""cider table,"" the safe and holy zone.

""Hey, Min-jun.""

Pastor Choi called to him while picking up a slice of boiled pork.

""Yes, Pastor.""

""Not there. Go sit over there.""

Pastor Choi's chopsticks pointed to the noisiest ""soju table""—specifically, to where Lee Do-geun was sitting.

""What? But they're drinking—""

""You got pushed back in the debate today, didn't you? A defeated general needs to hear what the victor has to say. Go mix in. What good is it if we just huddle among ourselves?""

""But Pastor, I don't drink.""

""Who told you to drink? Go talk. And stop acting like a Pharisee. Now go.""

It was an order. With no choice, Min-jun stood. Behind him, juniors called out, ""Min-jun, fighting!""

Holding his breath, Min-jun walked into ""enemy territory."" The smell of alcohol hit him immediately.

Do-geun sat in a corner seat with his back to the wall. In front of him, a clear soju glass was already filled.

""…May I sit here?""

Min-jun asked stiffly. Do-geun looked up. No flush in his cheeks—still calm and perfectly fine.

""Oh, you're here. Please, sit.""

Do-geun moved a bag off the chair. Min-jun sat across from him, careful not to let even their sleeves brush.

What caught his eye immediately was Do-geun's hands. When an older student poured a drink, Do-geun received the glass politely with both hands, turned his head slightly, and tossed it back in one clean motion.

Min-jun couldn't believe it.

""Seriously…""

He couldn't hold it in.

""Mr. Lee Do-geun—this is a genuine question.""

""Yes?""

Do-geun replied as he dipped raw onion into ssamjang.

""Are you really a believer?""

""What do you mean?""

""That. What you just drank. Liquor. Is it acceptable for someone who believes in God to drink hard liquor openly like that? Don't you know what Scripture says—'Do not get drunk'? 'For that is debauchery.' (Ephesians 5:18)""

Min-jun attacked with precise citation, as if trying to recover from his earlier defeat. A Christian drinking—this was, to Min-jun, his strongest moral high ground.

Do-geun swallowed the onion, wiped the corner of his mouth with a wet tissue, and answered in an almost disarmingly peaceful voice.

""Min-jun—Scripture says, 'Do not get drunk.' It doesn't say, 'Do not drink.'""

""That's the same thing! One drink becomes two, and two becomes drunkenness. If you want to keep yourself godly, you should avoid even the appearance of it.""

""Well. Jesus turned water into wine at the wedding in Cana. And not just any wine—the finest.""

Do-geun filled his own glass as he spoke.

""It probably wasn't Welch's grape juice. The text even records that people were 'well drunk.'""

""Th-that's the cultural context at the time—!""

Min-jun tried to push back, but Do-geun didn't give him room.

""I was taught that it's not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the heart. I drink this one glass with gratitude—and I don't hate anyone. Isn't that more godly?""

Do-geun smiled at Min-jun. Not a sneer—more like relaxed pity, as if to say, You live such a strict life.

""Have your cider, Min-jun. I'm not forcing you.""

He lifted the kettle lid and poured barley tea into Min-jun's empty cup.

Pourrrrr.

The sound felt, to Min-jun, like mockery—like it was showing how narrow his insides were.

Min-jun gripped the cup. ""It probably wasn't grape juice…""—annoyingly, even theologically, it was a fair point. This man drank and still looked sober and logical, while Min-jun—who'd only been drinking soda—felt his face burning hotter than anyone's.

""Let's just order.""

Do-geun raised his hand and called for the owner. Min-jun shut his mouth tight.

He'd lost again.

At a table reeking of alcohol, he—who wasn't drinking—felt like the most intoxicated person there.

""Sundaeguk for two!""

Two earthenware bowls landed on the table with heavy thumps. White steam rose from the boiling milky broth.

Min-jun opened the utensil container like a commander preparing for battle. He wanted to wash away the awkwardness and the sting of his loss with something blazing hot. He pulled the condiment tray toward him.

Plop. Plop. Plop.

He scooped three heaping spoonfuls of red seasoning paste into the bowl. The broth turned bright scarlet instantly. Still not satisfied, he added a spoonful of minced Cheongyang chili, salted shrimp, and a generous pile of perilla powder.

The soup's original color vanished.

In the bowl, thick red lava—like hellfire—boiled and churned.

Min-jun stirred the chaos with his spoon and looked across the table.

Do-geun simply stared at his own bowl.

He added nothing—no seasoning paste, no salt, no perilla powder.

He lifted his spoon, took a small sip of the clear broth, and swallowed with a quiet slurp. He closed his eyes briefly, as if savoring something, then opened them and added only a small amount—about a teaspoon—of brine from the salted shrimp.

That was it.

Min-jun frowned at the pale-looking bowl.

""How do you eat that? I mean—what does it even taste like?""

Do-geun blinked.

""Pardon?""

""Sundaeguk is supposed to be spicy. If it's that pale, it'll just taste gamey.""

As if showing off his ""finished"" red bowl, Min-jun took an exaggerated spoonful.

Do-geun took another sip of clear broth and answered.

""I don't really like masking the ingredients' natural flavor. If you put in too much seasoning, you can't even tell whether it's pork broth or just chili soup.""

For a moment, Min-jun's spoon froze midair.

It was just food talk, but it sounded, to him, like a pointed remark—like Do-geun was saying Min-jun's faith was covered over with ""heat"" rather than rooted in ""essence.""

Min-jun's stubborn pride flared. Sweating profusely, he swallowed the scalding broth. The spice ran down his throat and punched his stomach.

""Faith and food—if it's real, it has to be hot.""

Min-jun exhaled sharp and spicy.

""I can't stand lukewarm. Scripture says it too—be cold or hot. If you're lukewarm, He'll spit you out. (Revelation 3:16)""

Scripture again.

This time, Min-jun was sure he could press down that cold engineering student's nose.

Do-geun fished out a piece of sundae[3] and cooled it, seeming to think carefully about Min-jun's words.

""You really are hot-blooded, Min-jun.""

He nodded, as if conceding the point.

But the next sentence went somewhere Min-jun didn't expect.

""Still—water boils at 100 degrees, but life is sustained at 36.5.""

""…What?""

""If water stays at 100, it evaporates. Nothing remains. Isn't the sustainable temperature what matters? Not the temperament of a boiling pot—more like an earthenware bowl that keeps a gentle heat for a long time.""

Do-geun dipped the cooled sundae lightly into salted shrimp and ate.

Chew, chew.

Calm. Not a drop of sweat. He enjoyed the depth of the clear broth.

Min-jun, on the other hand, felt like he was dying. He'd put in too much chili; his tongue was numb. Sweat poured down his forehead. His stomach burned.

But he couldn't show it.

If he admitted it was too spicy and reached for water, it would feel like his ""hot faith"" had lost.

""Ahh… now this is the real stuff!""

Min-jun forced out an exclamation and swallowed more painful broth. His mouth was on fire.

Do-geun pulled a tissue from the dispenser and slid it toward Min-jun.

""Wipe your sweat. Aren't you pushing yourself too hard?""

""Too hard? I always eat like this. Bold and intense—no ambiguity!""

Min-jun snatched the tissue and scrubbed his forehead hard.

Red seasoning stained the tissue—almost like blood.

Damn it. Why do I turn childish every time I'm in front of this guy?

Min-jun glanced at Do-geun's clear, almost transparent bowl. It felt as though something secret might be hiding in that clean broth—some depth he didn't know, some taste he'd never learned to recognize.

The restaurant was still noisy—shouts from people drinking, the clink of glasses, the pungent smell of food swirling into a muddy mix.

Min-jun fidgeted with his glass of cider and stared across the table.

Lee Do-geun.

Even in this chaos, Do-geun was unshaken. Without loosening his tie, he simply raised his soju glass in quiet sips. Even alcohol seemed unable to dull his reason.

That flawless composure scraped at Min-jun's nerves.

Someone so cold, so logical—why?

Min-jun couldn't stand it anymore.

""Mr. Lee Do-geun.""

Do-geun lifted his head slowly. His eyes behind the lenses were cool.

""I have a question.""

""Go ahead.""

""You're an engineer.""

Min-jun's voice sharpened.

""So why do you believe in an invisible God? Isn't your principle to discard anything that can't be verified by data? Or is faith just… a placebo for emotional stability?""

Do-geun set his glass down. He didn't look offended. If anything, he seemed like he'd been waiting for that question. He fell silent for a moment, then spoke.

""Proof.""

Do-geun murmured the word.

""Min-jun—science explains 'how' very well. Why it rains, how cancer cells multiply, how the universe expands. You can prove it with equations—perfectly.""

His gaze drifted toward empty air, then returned to Min-jun.

""But it can't explain 'why.'""

""Why?""

""Why that kind person has to get cancer. Why innocent children have to suffer. Why the wicked seem to live better in this world.""

His voice lowered.

""In the lab, I try every day to build flawless logic. That's a world ruled by cause and effect. If there's an input, there must be an output.""

He paused.

""But the moment I step out of the lab, there's so much I can't make sense of. So much absurdity.""

Min-jun hesitated.

In Do-geun's expression, he saw a flicker of deep fatigue—not the fatigue of a tired researcher, but the fatigue of someone who endures the world's contradictions in silence.

""It's not because my intellect is so great…""

Do-geun smiled bitterly and filled his empty glass.

""It's because there are too many sorrows in this world that my intellect can't possibly explain. So I wonder if—behind this absurdity—there might be some meaning we don't see.""

""…""

""So don't be uncomfortable around me. I'm barely hanging on too.""

Do-geun drank with steady composure.

Min-jun couldn't say anything. The lines he'd prepared—about the limits of rationalism, the arrogance of scientism—swirled in his mouth and dissolved.

The man in front of him wasn't arrogant.

He was a severe skeptic and a seeker—someone who knew, to the bone, how powerless his own reason could be.

Barely hanging on…

Min-jun set down the cup he'd been holding.

Had he ever sought God with that kind of desperation?

He believed in a God who was ""obviously there.""

Do-geun clung to a God who ""had to be there.""

The gap silenced Min-jun.

""Thank you for the meal! Get home safely!""

When they slid the door open and stepped outside, sharp night air rushed in. Instantly, the heat of the restaurant and the smell of alcohol washed away. Min-jun shivered and pulled his collar tight.

Professors and students were already scattering—some busy calling taxis, others shouting for a second round at karaoke in small groups.

""Min-jun—aren't you coming?""

Pastor Choi leaned out the taxi window.

""Oh—no. I have something to take care of back near campus. Please go ahead.""

""All right. Good work today. Don't push yourself too hard.""

The taxi drove off, leaving an awkward silence in front of the restaurant.

Only two people remained: Min-jun and Do-geun.

Do-geun stood by the restaurant's vending machine, rummaging for coins.

Clatter.

With a familiar mechanical sound, two paper cups dropped.

""Milk coffee okay? The yulmu tea here is too watery.""

Do-geun handed one cup over. White steam curled upward.

Min-jun hesitated, then took it with both hands.

""…Thank you.""

They sat on the edge of the flowerbed in front of the restaurant. A streetlight flickered faintly overhead. Aside from the occasional whoosh of passing cars, the quiet felt so complete it made the earlier conflict and noise seem like a lie.

Min-jun blew on the hot coffee and took a sip.

Sweet, chalky instant mix.

Strangely, that cheap sweetness felt like it softened the nerves stretched tight all day.

""Min-jun.""

Do-geun spoke while staring into the distance.

""Yes.""

""If I came across as arrogant earlier, I apologize. The alcohol made me talk too much.""

His voice was plain—more like courteous closure than excuse.

""No. It's… not like you were wrong.""

Min-jun replied in a low mumble.

He didn't want to admit it, but he had to. In logic, in attitude, even in honesty—he'd been outmatched.

Do-geun took a sip and smiled faintly.

""I'm a little jealous of you, Min-jun.""

""Me? What are you talking about?""

Min-jun looked at him, puzzled.

Do-geun swirled the brown liquid in the paper cup.

""You have certainty. Hot, solid certainty.""

""…""

""My days are just one long series of shaking. My head doubts, and my heart barely holds on. So when I see a faith that's full of nothing but exclamation marks—like yours—I sometimes envy it.""

There was no sarcasm in his words. It sounded like sincere complaint.

Min-jun tightened his grip on the cup.

""Simplicity,"" Do-geun called it.

Do-geun saw him as ""a man of certainty,"" but Min-jun knew the truth: he was anxious too—perhaps more than anyone. He shouted louder and armed himself with harder texts just to keep that anxiety from showing.

And yet this man confessed his trembling so calmly.

Who was stronger?

The one who admits weakness, or the one who performs strength to conceal it?

""…I'm just enduring too.""

Min-jun let the truth slip out.

""Pardon?""

""I'm just… holding on as well.""

Do-geun turned to look at him.

Their eyes met briefly.

A strange smile spread at Do-geun's mouth—not the polite smile from before, but something warmer, more human.

""That's good.""

""What is?""

""Because it means I'm not the only one struggling. It feels like I found a fellow traveler.""

Do-geun finished his coffee and stood. Then he tossed the empty paper cup into the trash can—cleanly, right on target.

""Shall we walk to campus? Seems we're headed the same way.""

Do-geun took the lead. Min-jun looked at his back for a moment, then drained the rest of his coffee and stood.

The aftertaste of instant mix was bitter—and sweet.

Under the streetlight, the two men's shadows stretched long along the road. They were still separated like parallel lines, but at least the snarling tension between them had faded.

1qbsz3r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qbsz3r,New ZP6 Special - bad grind uniformity in comparison?!,"I recently got myself a ZP6 Special and have made some odd/confusing observations about grind uniformity that I'd like to share.

I have been using the ZP6 S for the last 1.5 weeks. About 250g of light roast coffee have gone through it by now. So it's not yet super well seasoned but according to many users on this sub it should be alright straight out of the box. I always grind at an angle, as to slow-feed.

Yesterday I did a little visual comparison of the grounds from my well-seasoned Timemore Sculptor 064 (non-S) and the grounds from the ZP6. I ground a few beans each at minimum, a few typical settings in between and at maximum to get an idea of the range of both grinders and how they compare. 

The Sculptor 064 is at standard calibration, which is 2.5 steps from chirp. I decidedly didn't calibrate 0 at chirp because I want to be able to access the coarser rather than the finer end. The ZP6 is calibrated so burr lock is at 0 (uncalibrated it was burr lock at -0.5).

On the 064 I also didn't put back in the fines caught by the knocker, because when I brew I also usually don't do that either.

Some interesting observations:

The grounds from the Sculptor 064 look way more uniform than those from the ZP6. Less fines (which I didn't reintroduce on the 064 so that checks out, I guess) but also many more boulders. This seems to be true across the entire range of settings, though it becomes difficult to judge on the finer end.

Since the ZP6 is known to produce incredibly uniform grinds this really baffles me and also worries me that something might be off.
As far as I know, the Sculptor 064 is also designed to be pretty unimodal, though maybe not as much.

I've checked if there is a wobble or some other obvious QC error but I didn't find anything out of the ordinary.

Also the grind size range is way different than what I was able to find online. ([064](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/timemore-sculptor-064-grind-settings/) and [ZP6](https://honestcoffeeguide.com/1zpresso-zp6-special-grind-settings/)):

I've been brewing around 5.5 on the ZP6 (2nd photo) and in the comparison those grounds looked similar to a 12-14 on the Sculptor (third photo) which almost maxes out the Sculptor. 

Generally the size difference of the grounds between settings seems to change much less on the Sculptor than on the ZP6. The ZP6 seems to have a much bigger range. It goes finer at a setting of 2 than the Sculptor 064 on 0.5 (aka 3 from chirp). Setting the ZP6 any tighter seemed reckless because the burrs start rubbing slighty at a little a above 1. Calibrating the Sculptor 064 to true zero might mitigate the difference in range on the finer end. I don't need that though.

But the ZP6 also grinds much coarser at a setting of 9 (max) versus a 16 (max) on the Sculptor 064. At that setting the grounds from the ZP6 are so incredibly coarse and non-uniform that they are entirely unusable. Just random chunks of bean. The ZP6 is obviously NOT made to grind that coarsely. 
A 16 on the Sculptor is still incredibly uniform.

I've heard that conical burr grinders get less uniform the coarser you grind. More so than flat burrs. Which makes sense, I guess, since bigger non-uniform pieces can just fall through on a conical.

Since 5.5 is still within in the range that a lot of people use on the ZP6 and smaller settings also seem less uniform than on the 064 I'm left behind confused as to the reason for this lack of uniformity on my ZP6. Also I've never heard of anyone grinding at a 11-14 on the 064. Though most people seem to have the 064S, so there's not much info on the 064 (non-S) online.


Could the lack of seasoning have such a significant effect? Wouldn't that increase fines rather than also produce more boulders? Any ideas or advice?

I know that visuals are way less important than taste but the visual difference is so obvious that I can't imagine it wouldn't impact the taste. The few brews I've had from the ZP6 have been pretty good but always with some astringency.",8,1768315049.0,pourover,18,0.75,False

1qbss2i,https://i.redd.it/0q7a1dash4dg1.jpeg,Mindful Breaker: Stop Doomscrolling,"Hey everyone,

I built this app for myself, taking inspiration from a premium feature in Niagara Launcher that sends a notification when you've been using an app for 5-10 minutes.

That simple feature really helped me break away from doomscrolling. I don’t know how many of you face this, but for me, it was a constant struggle. I’d instinctively click on Instagram intending to watch just one reel sent by a friend, and 20 minutes later, I’d still be scrolling through random videos.

Even though Niagara Launcher is great, I couldn't stick with it long-term. I didn't like having to remember every app name to search for it, so I eventually went back to my default launcher. However, I really missed those mindfulness notifications.

I decided to build something myself to replicate that feature. Initially, the app just sent a notification when I stayed in an app too long. But I got excited about the project and decided to expand it. That’s how **Mindful Breaker** was born - a tool designed to add a conscious pause before you get sucked into the loop.

**Main Features:**

* **Intent Analysis & Custom Intents:** The app asks why you want to open a distracting app. You can choose from presets or add your own custom reasons.
* **Daily Limits (Soft & Hard Mode):**
   * **Soft Mode:** Sends a warning when you reach your daily limit (e.g., 30 mins).
   * **Hard Mode:** Blocks access when the limit is reached. It includes an ""emergency lifeline"" feature - if you really need to access the app, you have to wait through a 60-second delay.
* **Focus & Sleep Modes:** Schedule specific hours where distracting apps are blocked (Focus Mode) or permanently disabled (Sleep Mode) to ensure rest.
* **Child Mode:** Set a usage limit, and once exceeded, the app locks behind a PIN code.
* **Mindful Breathing:** Forces a short breathing exercise (inspired by Wim Hof) at the intent screen to calm your mind before scrolling.
* **Usage Awareness:** Get notifications when you enter an app without a specific time limit, so you don't lose track of time.
* **Time-Based Lock:** Automatically blocks the app overlay when your selected session time is up.
* **Stats & Streaks:** Detailed weekly charts and streak tracking to help you build better habits.

**Privacy & Transparency:** To function correctly, Mindful Breaker uses the **AccessibilityService API**. This is used strictly to detect which app is currently active and to track the time spent in it. **Your privacy is paramount:** All data is processed and stored locally on your device. Nothing is ever sent to any external servers. You have full control over your data - you can export your statistics to a CSV file or delete all stored data directly within the app settings.

**Supported Languages:** The app is currently available in English, Polish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Ukrainian.

**Pricing:** Mindful Breaker is **100% free**. No ads, no paywalls. I believe this is fair because almost every wellbeing app nowadays hides features behind subscriptions, and I wanted to make something accessible to everyone.

I really hope this tool helps some of you introduce more mindfulness into your daily life. I’m looking for constructive feedback - if you have ideas on what to improve or fix, let me know in the comments!

I know, I know. I’m sorry lol don’t roll your eyes too hard just yet. 

I’m looking for someone to farm shiny objects with, eat way too many snacks, be slightly too cringe with and annoy for the foreseeable future. I won’t even make you play support in games we play together, I swear! I like playing all the classes and roles like a weirdo. Feel free to be a tank and be my knight in scantily clad armor (cause you know games don’t be giving women real armor lmao) or play support and save me constantly from self imposed impending doom, I don’t mind either way. If you don’t game or are at least interested in sitting in my lap and being my commentary, let’s not act like this would ever work out long term lol. Bear with me here.. 

Do I have other interests? Absolutely. I pride myself on knowing a little about a lot and can absolutely keep convos going regardless of topic. I guess I can thank the former bartender brain lol. I would also love to get involved with things you like or do. Even if it means having to lug myself up a very tiny mountain a couple times a year. But just expect like 75% of the time for me to rather hide in a blanket fort with you. 

If your ideal Saturday is waking up and staying in bed with me far longer than we should, OD on caffeine (iced coffee is always superior to hot, even in the winter), and then we game all day together while chomping on snacks.. you might be the one. Are you down for some cringe side by side PC setups type ish or what?

I’m into sassy nerds/weirdos with pretty eyes, pop punk vibes and chaotic energy. My tastes are pretty much up in the air though. I like everything from Aubrey Plaza RBF energy to the apologize to inanimate objects and can’t ask for extra sauce types. Freckles are a plus but not a necessity. Personality does hold a heavier hand in my decision but obviously physical attraction is very important too.

Send via smoke signal:

- Recent game you like or have been addicted to (I’ll only judge a little).
- Favorite snack (you gotta share it though or we throwing hands).
- How to unlock the secret Easter egg to your heart (just asking for a friend).

Time for me to fake like I’m doing work so I can get paid and afford my cats food and our future game passes.

we landed at JFK around 8:30am on saturday. took the air train to E to F (maps said this was fastest at the time). 

We got off at the bottom of central park (57th Ave). Got breakfast at Jams (58th & 6th ave) then walked to Birch Coffee (SO GOOD, 62nd & lexington) 

Roamed around central park for awhile. We popped out of central park around the 80s so we went to Mariana Pizza (91st & lexington). 

Took the F to Chelsea to visit my favorite coffee shop from last visit Velvette Espresso Bar (25th St)

Took the F up to Rockefeller center. Luckily the tree was still up so we were super excited about that. Visited the jewelry store Cat Bird (absolutely gorgeous and sustainable!!)

Walked from Rockefeller to time square. It was super rainy so it was practically empty. 

Walked from time square to the empire state building. there was barely a view due to the rain but it was a good laugh.

Then it was time to head to LGA. Took the F to the Q70 bus and got dinner at the airport.


I ordered a long raincoat from Amazon along with Northbound Dr Scholl’s chelsea boots. Added a beanie, wool socks, and waterproof mittens and I was warm and dry the entire day even though it rained most of the day!

1qbsq3o,https://www.reddit.com/r/therapycritical/comments/1qbsq3o/did_my_therapist_cross_ethical_boundaries/,Did my therapist cross ethical boundaries?,"Hi guys, this is a situation that happened to me a while back, but I’m still finding myself ruminating over it. I would really appreciate your input.

I started therapy for the first time in January 2025. I quickly realised I was attracted to my therapist. I hoped she’d be cold and distant so I wouldn’t develop feelings but she was warm and very welcoming.

In just our second session, I disclosed my experience with SA, and she shared her own story in response. It felt like a pivotal moment in building emotional trust and connection between us. During that same session, she told me that she doesn’t just forget about clients when the session ends and that she thinks about me a lot.

In the third session, she told me I was beautiful and asked, “Have you ever had a boyfriend or girlfriend?” When I said no, she replied, *“Well, they must all be blind.”* That moment intensified my emotions and attachment. She continued to compliment my appearance in later sessions and said “I imagine you get a lot of attention because you’re very attractive.” At another point, when I told her I felt like a burden, she said, *“You’re my priority.”*

I eventually came out to her as a lesbian. She was the first person I ever told, and she said she was ""honoured"" and even admitted she sometimes questions her own sexuality from time to time.

She encouraged me to text her anytime if I felt low, and said we could even meet outside of sessions. Our hugs at the end of each session lasted 10–20 seconds… always tight and meaningful. 

One night, when things turned violent in my home, I texted her at 1AM in distress. I didn’t expect a reply, but she responded with: *“I’m here for you not just as a therapist, but because I care x.”* She even offered to send a taxi to bring me to her house to stay the night. I declined, but she then suggested we meet for coffee another time.

My feelings for her grew, and eventually I wrote her a letter and made her a CD with some of my favorite songs. My mom found it before I had the chance to give it to her. She immediately messaged my therapist to tell her I had “unnatural feelings” and demanded she cut off contact with me all before I got the chance to speak for myself.

I sent her a follow-up text to say the following:

*""I’m really sorry. I feel so disheartened that this is how things unfolded. My mum found the gifts I made and was planning to give to you and immediately knew their meaning and context.*

*I never meant for this to happen and I’m so ashamed, but I completely understand if you think a break is necessary for the therapeutic process or even termination if you feel that is what’s best. I just wanted to acknowledge it myself rather than hearing it second hand.*

*I sincerely apologise if you’ve taken any offence at all or have made you feel uncomfortable. I know it’s very stupid and illogical. I understand the importance of your role, the ethical duties and would never want to jeopardise your career or life. I completely understand it would never be reciprocated and I never expected it to be. I just wanted to say thank you again for everything. I can’t thank you enough. My appreciation and respect is beyond measure.""*

And she replied with this:

*""Therapists cannot accept gifts. You have not at all made me feel uncomfortable or offended. As my client and as your over the age of 16 confidentiality is paramount and termination etc is your decision. Take some time to work on what we discussed yesterday. I wish you all the best in the future.""*

She texted my mum to say she regretted to inform that she would be stopping contact. I was absolutely heartbroken at the time. Then 2 weeks passed by and she showed up at my workplace after termination (she knew where I worked). She called my name, asked how I was, told me she sought out help from supervision and said I could come back to therapy any time I wanted. I asked if I could give her a hug and she didn’t answer, she just embraced me in her arms. When I was watching her walk down the stairs to leave she never turned back.

I didn’t contact her again until 3 months later when I got a bipolar diagnosis and she responded by saying “I ask that you refrain from contacting me, respecting your mom’s wishes”.

Overall, the situation has me really confused. The mixed signals are crazy. What do you guys think? Did she simply get scared once a third party found out and stepped in, and then tried to reinforce boundaries way too late? Am I imagining her breaking boundaries?

I would really appreciate any advice, thank you! :)",1,1768314441.0,therapycritical,1,1.0,False

Great time to meet a chatty friend.,"Good morning from the Southeast US!  Its a chilly on this morning and it was tough getting out of bed. Coffee hasn't kicked in but I'm sitting at my cubicle typing out this message. Looking for a procrastination partner to waste the day with. Lets chit chat about life, make each other laugh, and become fast friends. 

I'm a chill and laid back guy that is a jack of all trades kinda man. I like working with my hands and solving problems. I have a great job and enjoy what I do. Being sarcastic comes second nature to me.  I enjoy the outdoors, kayaking, fishing, mountain biking, and riding my motorcycle. I like to be active but also dont mind rotting on the couch with a good movie. I'm also a pretty decent looking guy. 

If your up for a conversation and making a new friend, dont hesitate to say hello! ",2,1768314197.0,Kikpals,1,1.0,False
