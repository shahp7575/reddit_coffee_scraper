I originally spotted the mussel and said I wanted it! But then realized I really need something that I can carry with me and the mussel is more for indoor display. Then I turned to the Sun family. I fell in love with the Sun charm but it is currently out of stock on the U.S. site, so I also considered the Sun medium (or huge?) or the Sun bag. The more I browse the site, the more I fell in love with. As you can see in the screenshot, I selected many. Your input, experience sharing, real-life photos would be greatly appreciated!

I am new to this board so apologize if I don't reply to your comments right away. Thank you all! Stay warm and healthy!

I saw a post here, a person was complaining how he is wasting 4 hours out of no where

wakes up in morning,

makes coffee ,

sits to work,

somehow end up on mobile,

again tried back to work,

again back to mobile...

  
See how he is wasting his time doing wrong things.

he makes coffee first thing is the morning - comfort zone, also a person who wants to do work will wake up early and straight to the workouts or work, not make coffee first.

after making coffee he sits to work shows that he don't really care about work, just doing it for the sake of doing it. 

then he goes for mobile some how, again shows doing for the sake of it.

watches reels, or what ever bro is into,

fries his dopamine receptors early in the morning and bro want to get things done and be productive.

Gear: Starblox Latte

Full name: S.B. Latte (Latte)

**Lore:**

A mad scientist whose main job is working as a barista. This doesn‚Äôt stop him from working on his passion though!¬†

Suffers from chronic fatigue whenever he is off his caffeine drinks. So far, his own brews are the most effective in combating his fatigue.

Experiments with all sorts of chemicals to add into his drinks. So far there‚Äôs no bad effects to his health yet, and his fatigue is still not cured.

Has contacts with the Inpherno for shipment of chemicals banned or difficult to source in Pharadiso. His friends warn him about the dangers of Inphernals. He‚Äôs still stubborn.¬†

Despite his erratic behaviour on caffeine, he‚Äôs actually quite docile and calm when his fatigue hits him. His fatigue causes him to be effectively drowsy, however.

**Stats:**

Top Speed: 4/10 (Normal) (depends on the level of acceleration rolled from Fresh Brew)

Handling: 4/10 (Normal) (unpredictable due to the high acceleration buffs)

Acceleration: 10/10 (Normal)

**Abilities:**

**Caffeine Rush**: Dash forward for a distance your current speed would reach in 5 seconds. (If you are on Pumpkin Spice or any other buffs/debuffs, it takes them into account.) Ignores all obstacles during its effect, but may cause debuffs once it finishes. Cooldown of 20 seconds.

**Fresh Brew**: Gain a random percentage of acceleration buff on a double dice roll. Lowest is 50% and highest is 120%. However, roll lower than 5 and it becomes a debuff of slowness instead. Lowest is 10% and highest is 40%. Cooldown of 30 seconds.

**PHINISHER! Pumpkin Spice and Everything Nice**: Gain 120% acceleration buff for 10 seconds. Ignore all obstacles and debuffs, gaining immunity. Any racer hit gets stunned for 2 seconds. Cooldown of 60 seconds.¬†

I‚Äôm currently redesigning my home office to make better use of the available space and create a more comfortable setup for daily work.

**Room size:** approx. 300 cm x 260 cm with a little corners in the left part.

**Main desk (min. 150x60 cm):**  
I plan to keep this area clean and functional for dual monitors (one vertical, one horizontal), with enough space for my keyboard, mouse, a notebook, a cup of coffee, small speakers, and a desk lamp. (I am not sure if this is small)

I‚Äôm considering getting a **height-adjustable desk**, but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs really worth it. I also plan to add a couple of **IKEA Alex drawers** to improve organization.

**Secondary desk (120x60 cm):**  
This one is just for small side tasks ‚Äî processing 3D prints, quick fixes, board games, wrapping gifts‚Ä¶ basically, a flexible workspace.

**Storage & furniture:**

* **Kallax:** for books, games, and some collectibles.
* **BROR (small):** tools, VR gear (glasses, etc..), and some storage boxes.
* **BROR (large):** main 3D printing station ‚Äî tools, filament storage, 3D printer, and a small NAS on the top shelf connected to the network.

Any advice or ideas to make this layout more efficient or comfortable are very welcome! I am using the ikea planner,the desktop here is 140cm, should be min 150cm.

I‚Äôd like the room **not to feel too narrow or cramped**, and to still have comfortable space to move around.

Also, I‚Äôve noticed that the **Kallax is really close to the other BRON** or that **the second desk sits too close to the Alex drawers**, making it hard to open them or work comfortably.

I‚Äôm currently preparing for NEET PG and INICET, and honestly, this phase gets really lonely sometimes. Most of my college friends have drifted away, and I don‚Äôt really have anyone in this city to talk to. My days mostly go into studying (or trying to), but even with a full schedule, the loneliness still finds its way in.

I did try dating apps for a while but the people over there are too adventurous, too outgoing for my taste. I'm a really simple person. I can't go out for treks on the weekend or take random unplanned trips (I mean parents ko kya bolu??üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠)

I live with my family, so like most brown households ‚Äî privacy and freedom are kind of... limited üòÖ. It‚Äôs not like I can just step out to meet someone. So I thought maybe I could find a friend online ‚Äî someone to check in with a few times a day, share random ‚Äúguess what just happened‚Äù moments, or even keep each other accountable if you‚Äôre studying too.

Even if we don‚Äôt always have much to talk about ‚Äî that‚Äôs okay. Sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to know someone‚Äôs there on the other side of the screen.

A little about me - 

I love reading romcoms, horror, and fiction in general ‚Äî though I‚Äôm trying to get into more non-fiction lately. Currently reading The Mountain Is You.

Shows I love: Friends, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Modern Family, HIMYM, 2 Broke Girls, and my absolute comfort show ‚Äî Gilmore Girls.

I‚Äôm a dark academia fan; my Instagram feed is full of moody quotes and rainy coffee aesthetics. Still waiting to meet someone who gets the same quiet ache behind them.

I‚Äôm not very talkative (nothing much happens when you‚Äôre home all day), but I‚Äôm a good listener.

Mental health is something I really value and try to take care of.

I‚Äôm looking for honest, kind, empathetic, and emotionally available people ‚Äî the kind who aren‚Äôt afraid to show vulnerability or talk about real things. (Still waiting to meet a man who yaps, though üò≠). And please, if you are gonna ghost, stay away. It hurts. 

So if you‚Äôre a fellow fall person ‚Äî someone who feels the nostalgia and soft yearning October brings ‚Äî maybe we could be friends. üåô",2,1761637858.0,u_Yoursanxiouslyy,1,1.0,False

The main problem is that i want to build something that works for me, with or without me, my father sees the 9-5 in the most wrong way you can imagine, he says ""yeaa people going to work at 9 and heading home at 5, when do they even get their job done""( just to mention he is working basically for free almost whole his life, we were dependent on our mother most of the time, he was always working, going back i can remember 2 or 3 times when he attended my birthday and I see why) What he does is pointless, we are doing extra work, when i try to optimise and adjust, he says no we can't skip those few steps. I wanted to split, he offered me to do it my way, becouse otherwise what he sid his whole life I won't continue and it will go down the drain...I accepted(dumbass) now i do even more almost not paid labor, the e-commerce is starting to work(slowly...) but i can't focus on anything... I hate what I am doing, stupid tasks that involve me staying 3-4 hours a day in traffic....I don't know what to do, My income in low(after ads) I live with my gf we are not getting any support from our parents, I am working late, my mind is a mess and my body also...I am not happy, I feel like i am paying for ny father's wrong decisions...I got fooled, I know why he is like that, can't judge him, but I also can't leave him....they have problems with my mother...he is always and always has been working...He says I don't do nothing and its saying it to my grandparents and my mother also...I got asked from them ""What do you actually do to deserve this salary from him""....I need advice, I need to do something I hate myself..I want to just turn off...and forget everything...Sry for the bad English..If you have any questions I am willing to answer..I will appreciate any help and advice...thank you all in advance, be blessed ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,1761637845.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

None of the issues were resolved, and I was left to mind myself and essentially bug my coworkers on how to do anything. Whilst I am very independent and tend to pick things up quick, my coworkers were definitely starting to get annoyed.
After essentially a week of no resolutions I contacted the Ops Manager, in which they said that, that's not right, nor the procedure that they had in place. I was given a promising resolution.

The next day I was told to sit down have a chat that lead to being called a ""leak"" and that I was being disloyal and disrespectful.
I was fired ten minutes into the conversation because I refused to continue what in my mind was bullying and blatant retaliation.

I was sent a termination letter 10 minutes after said conversation and clocking out of work. Unfortunately I am still in the 90 trial period.

There is a lot more to add, which makes me a little bit lost on what to do.

After my termination letter (just a little over an hour to be exact) I was sent a garbled text of the ""termination letter being a miscommunication""
Upon receiving this I sent it to my ops manager, which lead to a phone call, that confirmed I am terminated, and will not be working there as its uncomfortable, especially with the behaviour I have experienced.

Today I recieve a message after much confusion of why I am rostered when I have been fired that I am terminated and I will recieve a weeks worth of wages. I am only guessing this is because my termination letter needed to give me a weeks notice of which being fired on the same day, does not fulfill this requirement.

There is a lot of I haven't put in case they see this, but the whole situation has been a nightmare for the legitimately 72 hours this has occurred.

Do I have any case here for a personal grievance?
Is there anything I can do?
Or should I give up hope?

Just to be clear, I don't want to work there, but this process to termination doesn't feel right at all.",8,1761637634.0,LegalAdviceNZ,3,1.0,False
1oi3b7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Maternity/comments/1oi3b7y/can_i_sue/,Can I sue?,"Looking for advice, sorry in advance for the long post but this is as short as possible. I‚Äôm currently 5 months into my 9 month maternity leave with my job I‚Äôve had for the last 8.5 years. I‚Äôm a manager in a big name coffee shop. During pregnancy our payrol kept messing up my pay, either underpaying my majorly, or not paying me hours worked but using my holidays. The store was falling apart and I was getting very little to no support from higher ups. My midwife ended up strongly suggesting getting signed off sick as the stress was affecting my blood pressure and my mental health considerably (I was already seeking help due to last birth almost killing me). I ended up calling a meeting with my area manager and told her how much all of this stress was affecting me and hold her honestly it had ended up with me feeling pretty sui***al. It was just too much. Anyway they had to do a wellness check and an extra risk assessment and a reduction in hours with no affect of pay was agreed upon as they couldn‚Äôt offer an alternative workload so alt hours were all that was left. That was fine for a few weeks then visits stopped, I got no help with prep for me leaving and getting my replacement in. My pay was still getting messed up then I came off with no visit prior, no message, nothing. 3 weeks later I had to be induced due to preeclampsia. All was fine but work still owed me ¬£350 odd which was a combination of wrong rate holiday pay and the reduced hours that I was getting paid for all of a sudden weren‚Äôt accepted even though it was fine for the several pays before hand. Anyway I ended up putting in an official grievance with the payrol, went it to area manager, general manager, payrol manager and our HR department. I got absolutely no reply. So I went to acas. Gave them all the information and proof of my pay etc, they reached out to the company for early conciliation and they were also ignored. Leaving a workplace tribunal the next solution. I‚Äôve recently found out our premises is up for sale but it‚Äôs a very big franchise so I‚Äôm not concerned about them ‚Äògoing under‚Äô. Anyway now I‚Äôm left with due to go back in 4 months, not sure what I‚Äôm going back to, if there will even be a job and if there is going back to a job that clearly cares so little about their management and can‚Äôt even pay me right. This has caused such an immense impact on my mental health and quite frankly has put a big shadow on a lot of my maternity leave. Does this sound like something I could sue for? And if so any idea on how long it would take to deal with? I‚Äôve been applying for jobs but had no luck. Anyway thank you for reading üíú",1,1761637628.0,Maternity,2,1.0,False
1oi397v,https://www.reddit.com/r/mealprep/comments/1oi397v/mealprepping_while_disabled/,Mealprepping while Disabled?,"This is probably gonna be a long shot, and apologies in advance for how long this post is going to be, but I really need help coming up with meal prep ideas. I only do meal prep once a week for the entire week, but I need to change my diet for my health, and I'm really struggling to come up with ideas.

I'm neurodivergent and disabled. I have ADHD, Autism, OCD, chronic pain, chronic fatigue, digestive issues, and several food allergies/intolerances. My doctor says I need to start the FODMAP diet to try to figure out my digestive issues, but I'm also lactose and gluten intolerant, allergic to some raw vegetables (like broccoli and onions), and get acid reflux easily from spicey and acidic foods (like hot sauce, tomatoes, and coffee). My nutritionist also said I need to stay away from processed and red meat, but fish and poultry are fine. But because of the AuDHD and OCD, I have sensory issues and germaphobia, and absolutely hate handling raw meat, especially chicken, so I've been using canned chicken instead. I also have to stay away from vitamin C for two hours before and after taking my meds in the morning, otherwise my ADHD meds don't work as well as they should, so I can't have anything with fruit in it for breakfast.

My chronic pain and fatigue makes it really difficult to stand for more than 30 mins to an hour at a time, but because of my ADHD, it's really easy to get distracted and sidetracked, especially if I'm trying to learn a new recipe for the first time. I also get overwhelmed easily by recipes that have a lot of ingredients, which can make it take even longer for me to do my meal prep. So what should only take me about 1 hour at most, usually ends up taking me 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or more.

I was never taught how to cook, so I'm trying to figure things out as I go, but it's so exhausting and overwhelming having to learn how to make new, complicated recipes all the time. I usually end up trying to get as much pre-made food as possible, but with my limited diet, my groceries have been about $200 a week for just me, and I just can't afford to keep doing that anymore.

I have a microwave, an oven, a stove, an air fryer, and a rice cooker, but no blender or food processor or anything else like that. I also live with two other people, so I don't have much room in the kitchen/fridge/pantry to store extra food or kitchen gadgets and things. I only have the energy to go grocery shopping once every other week (and even that's really difficult for me) and only buy exactly what I'll need for my meal prep for those two weeks, and I don't have room for anything more than that.

I've asked several people for advice now, but any meal prep suggestions I've been given so far are all at least twice as difficult for me than the meals I've already been making. I know there's probably not much advice anyone here can give me, but I'm asking everyone I possibly can for help, because I have no idea what I'm supposed to do at this point. Any and all advice is very appreciated.",1,1761637391.0,mealprep,2,1.0,False

Our husbands really liked each other so we begun seeing each other more often (meanwhile i gave up the training with her) until i started becoming triggered by her, she is very loud, very ‚Äúpick me‚Äù style, she ‚Äúknows‚Äù everything, everytime she was asking me loud about my clothes or bags (especially luxury) and then commenting something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre rich‚Äù. (She has a good financial situation through her husband and she is addicted to shopping, her husband complains to mine everytime but if you see their IGs, they are on yachts, travels and  look like the richest persons when they have sometimes problems renting a new home because of price). I don‚Äôt like these kind of people so i told my husband he can be friends but not to include me, so i was seeing them very rare so my husband started going out only with him and they now have a group of other guys (neighbours). She is often going out with only the guys and behaving like one in front of them but my husband noticed that when she is not there, her husband is behaving different, complaining about her spending money and women are like this and also he checks on other women. 

Anyways, we don‚Äôt keep in touch but once i needed a key from my husband and when i went to the restaurant, she was there (with the guys again) so i stayed for a coffee.

Issues with breathing.","26M, 182cm, 90kg Filipino. Bit of Spanish, Japanese, and Chinese in my blood. History with asthma during childhood and grew up just fine albeit I probably lived as a shallow breather my entire life up til now.

I was physically active, til I stopped back at late April due to breathing problems. First diagnosis was potential bronchitis, then after testing some meds prescribed by the doc my condition didn't improve much. Doc wasn't in for a week so I went to see a different doc. He said I had pneumonitis. I eventually recovered from it. 

Another similar ""difficulty breathing"" episode came to me around August but this time the doc says my lungs were clear and it was acid reflux. That's just about it for my breathing history this year. Nothing of the sort occurred to me previously.

September 21, I slept in an airconditioned room (I usually don't) and my nose was extremely dry yet stuffy. Hoarse as hell voice with slight difficulty breathing only. A few days after, I started being unable to talk well and realized it must have been flu. After I recovered from the hoarse voice, stuffy nose, and mild fever, I started feeling better but my breathing didn't. I've been considering this as acid reflux so I adjust my diet again but sometimes I would still have trouble breathing. There are days where I don't realize my breathing is troubled until I start thinking about it. I've been chronically stressed and anxious for a while now and my condition isn't exclusively the reason why. There are times where I feel like my body is imbalanced and like I will fall to one side. Sometimes the left part of my body feels pins and needles. Sometimes I have a stabbing headache. And just recently, it feels like I can't seem to pass gas and expel fluid from my body. Although, my urine is normal. My stool is normal. But my tummy feels full so I only ever get to eat a small amount. There are days I feel like I can breathe just fine and days where suddenly I can't. If I relax and bother myself, I will typically feel fine but when my mind is left to wander, I start feeling ill again. I usually play card games with friends to get my mind off. One note I will make of is that my phleghm is white and frothy. 

I feel like I am crazy for feeling so many different things for a while now and I've always been just blaming it on stress and anxiety so I've been trying to bother myself in different ways. I don't find an opportunity to find exercise these days but when I have time, I go out for walks under the 8AM sunlight and typically feel better. Sometimes I also wondered if this old house we're living in is causing some sort of allergic reaction to me. We're meaning to move out of this house by November 15. 

If you must know my diet. A cup of coffee every morning and my meals are usually soups or stews served with rice. I eat a balance of chicken, beef, pork, fruits, and vegetables. When we stock up on eggs, I typically eat two fried eggs. Sometimes I opt for hardboiled eggs. I don't use a lot of salt in my meals but when I use soy sauce in my cooking I don't add salt anymore. When there's bread, I just toast it with peanut butter on. Sometimes I will indulge and eat street food such as battered quail eggs (kwek-kwek) and dumplings (siomai) but only once every two weeks. My meals daily aren't consistent and I only get to eat 2 meals a day at best. Sometimes I worry if I overhydrate, and sometimes I forget to hydrate. Happens when I am busy with work. I cut down coffee because I thought it was contributing to my strange ill feelings.

For the most part I am extremely happy in my relationship and I am very much in love and making plans for my bf and I to move in together eventually. My boyfriend and I live in two very expensive cities and make about the same in terms of income per year. However, due to differences in our upbringing and financial responsibilities, I have more ‚Äúdisposable income‚Äù. My bf‚Äôs is the breadwinner for his family. His dad passed away and his mom has been a stay at home mom for many years and before that couldn‚Äôt keep a job for more than a few months. My boyfriend pays about $1650 of their rent which is about 70% of the overall rent since his dad passed away and other expenses including his own personal bills and medical bills because his mom doesn‚Äôt have a job (not sure if she‚Äôll ever get one as it‚Äôs been over a year and has not applied for any jobs) he has a younger brother who works part time and helps pay for the remaining rent/bills. My bf is constantly on a budget. He can‚Äôt afford to move out because it‚Äôs actually cheaper for him to stay in their current living situation. He‚Äôs constantly living pay check to pay check. I on the other hand, live with both my parents and they charge me about $600 in rent, i don‚Äôt have a car note, I pay for my own bills, wifi, phone,credit cards, etc. and I am able to save money to eventually move out and start a life with my boyfriend. 

One of things I‚Äôm concerned about is my boyfriend‚Äôs financial situation. Over the 3 years we‚Äôve been together I have given or loaned money to my boyfriend-sometimes he pays me back, sometimes he doesn‚Äôt and it hasn‚Äôt bothered me because I know it‚Äôs difficult for him to ask me but they‚Äôre usually to buy groceries or help pay for medical bills. I usually will offer, he will never ask for a certain amount and will let me decide how much I wanna give and it can range from $20-$50 or $100-$200. I‚Äôm very generous with the amount I give him. I‚Äôve noticed however that over the years he‚Äôs become more and more comfortable asking for money or sayings he‚Äôll split the cost of something but he doesn‚Äôt pay me back unless I ask and if I do it‚Äôll take him time to pay me back. Because we are in a long distance relationship, we visit or go on vacation every 4-6 months to see the each other. I usually take time off of working WITHOUT pay. Our vacations are about 7-10 days. During those vacations we will split the bill on lodging, excursions, dates, food, etc. or sometimes I will pay for something and he‚Äôll cover me for the next expense or we just treat each other with no expectations of payment. But the costs are not always equal and sometimes he doesn‚Äôt always pay me back when we‚Äôre suppose to ‚Äúsplit‚Äù the costs of something. For example, if we have dinner somewhere my boyfriend will ask me to pay and it‚Äôll be $150. Then the next time we go out to eat he‚Äôll offer to pay for lunch and it‚Äôll cost $75. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôm constantly paying for the LARGER cost of something and he‚Äôll offer to pay for something lesser and then it‚Äôs an even ‚Äúexchange‚Äù. I will pay for $50 lunch and he‚Äôll pay for $20 coffee or boba. I don‚Äôt usually pay attention to the costs of things when we‚Äôre on vacation but started to when I had to pay for credit card bills and the expenses were becoming difficult for me to pay because unless I ask for his share I don‚Äôt get anything or sometimes it‚Äôll take him weeks to pay me back. This recent vacation I told him he owed me about $345 in uber rides and food. Because of his financial situation I didn‚Äôt charge him the full amount of expenses we agreed to split because I felt bad even asking him. It would be closer to $500, if I included the cash not just charges to my credit card. My boyfriend brought up times where he also paid for my meals and covered my expenses and I did take those into account and he would still owe me closer to $500. These are only the expenses he and I agreed upon to split the costs of. He told me he‚Äôd pay me back but it was going to take ‚Äúa long time‚Äù meaning a few weeks maybe. I got upset but didn‚Äôt say anything it was expected. My reason for posting about this is, I want to know am I overreacting or is this normal for couples with a difference in finances. I have a lot history of being financially abused my people in my own family. I am sensitive to people borrowing money from me or being entitled to my finances so I tend to hyper fixate on my money and expenses. For the majority of our relationship the finances have not bothered me but the more I plan for our future to move and live together it puts the financial aspect of our relationship into perspective. Just to clarify, my boyfriend and I will treat each other and offer to pay or buy things for each other without asking or expecting the other person to pay. These are just times where he wants to split the cost of something and I agree and we usually use my credit card for these expenses. My cards are always the default payment method. He usually will pay me back if I remind him or bring it up. I don‚Äôt usually bother with it. But when I do ask for him to pay me back I always have to wait, sometimes I forget about it. 

The bottom line is should I be concerned about my bf constantly asking or borrowing money from me and not paying me back? Or is this normal? Also I‚Äôm not rich, I work all the time and try to pick up OT hours at work to make up for lost income while in vacations. I grew up with two immigrant parents and grew up fully aware of my parent‚Äôs finances. I am responsible with money, I am extremely frugal and the only time I really spend money are on our vacations to see each other or special occasions. But because of my history of being taken advantage of financially by family and people close to me. Am I overreacting or overthinking? Is this something I need to talk about with him?

I assume that means I have the recipe for it unlocked but I don‚Äôt see it in my recipe list yet. It‚Äôs very possible I am not a high enough level to make it (currently cooking level 6). 

Speaking of unlocked, if you view your recipe list and see ones with ‚Äú???‚Äù symbol, reading the description will tell you what items is needed to make it. Nikki will have little dialogue to say if the ingredients seem to work together or not. Once you do it, the word ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù will pop up letting you know you got the recipe if it was successful. So it seems you can eat a dish and have a chance of unlocking that recipe, regardless of your cooking level.

Most of the drinks (maybe all) you craft give home insight, but it wont give you any if you are already at the daily limit - I‚Äôve already tested this just to be sure ü§≠.

1oi340v,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1oi340v/friend_reached_out_after_almost_a_year/,Friend reached out after almost a year,"Fine day to you all. I feel like I need help and honestly I don't have someone from my circle that I can talk about this issue. I had a friend who we were inseparable with, since we started university where we met. We were on discord pretty much every single day. Talking, playing games together, watching movies et cetera, we would laugh at the same stuff when we met by just looking at each other.

We started self learning software development to find a related job as we wanted the same career path as well, but had our ups/downs about it and we always discussed other possibilities together too. During those moments I always thought about him just as much as I thought about myself, I even had some opportunities offered to me and asked if I could include my friend on it. I felt like we were on the path ""together"", although I got lazy and lost interest because I wasn't sure I could make it. He didn't even feel like trying this career when I was studying online bootcamps and I always tried to motivate him and even told him I felt he'd do it even better than me, legitimately. I sometimes told him about other possibilities, like how I could arrange something abroad due to my family member living there and have him included as well.

Time passed on and he landed a good position, I was really happy for him and even told about him to my other friend circles etc as an example to what one could do if they really wanted. But my progress completely came to a halt meanwhile. As he had way more progress and now professional knowledge&experience on the matter, I expected him to ""nudge"" me so to say and ask about my progress or at least just offer to help, or point me into any directions. I asked him few times but his tone came off a bit strange to me, like he was looking down at me, because he never offered to help me. Or asked about how's my projects are going, or anything.

I felt totally let down because I have passed opportunities to him that were offered to me exclusively and not him. I never mentioned to him obviously but I felt like that's what best friends do, lift each other up. Was it selfish of me to expect the same from him? So I stopped talking to him last year, making excuses whenever he called me etc.

So a year ago he understood something was wrong and asked what was up, I explained briefly that I didn't feel like he empathized with me as a friend and never offered to help which made me feel super let down. His message was more about how he felt he did right but that I am obviously free to feel however I feel. Their action to me stating why I'm feeling let down made it worse for me. If I was in his shoes, I would have reached out on the phone, asked them to meet them somewhere for a coffee so we could talk about it. And I would have listened to their perspective. I would apologize for making someone feel like they're let down instead of trying to prove that I'm not the one to blame and ask what I could do to make things better now or be more careful for the next time. Especially if this was my closest friend whom I've been talking to every single day for years.

I didn't reply to his message which he sent last year, as it didn't move things for me and even made it a bit worse. I felt like it proved my suspicions about him not valuing my feelings about our friendship as much as I did. Now he sent a message a couple days ago, again, asking if we can meet sometime to discuss so he could at least be ""relieved"" because the issue bothers him. This made me even more stressed out, as he took almost a YEAR to come up with this when I would have asked him the moment had he expressed something I did that bothered him.

Now I feel like I feel stressed thinking about this friendship and I would really appreciate totally outside opinions as to whether I'm being unfair or not. I'm sorry for the wall of text but I felt whatever I wrote was necessary to the context. I am super thankful if you've read this far and would really appreciate it a lot more if you could share your opinion, here or privately, doesn't matter.",2,1761636770.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

Here I am again, writing another review, with my music playing and my extra long black coffee nice and hot, and, although I already had all my ideas organized in my head, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to give another listen to the model I present today: **Kefine Delci AE**, released in 2024.

As in every analysis, I present **my sources:**

\-FiiO K11 for video games on the main PC.  
\-FiiO KA13 while working.  
\-FiiO BTA30 Pro + FiiO BTR13 for LDAC wireless listening at home.  
\-FiiO BTR13 + iPhone 16 Pro Max for wireless listening on the street.  
\-FiiO KA11.  
\-FiiO JA11.  
\-Macbook Air M4 3.5mm output.  
\-Shanling M0 Pro. **NEW!!**  
\-Amazon Music Ultimate.  
\-Local FLAC and MP3 files.

If you don‚Äôt want to keep reading, here are the **Pros and Cons:**

*-Pros*  
\>The most comfortable set I‚Äôve ever tried.  
\>Works very well with any source.  
\>Very wide soundstage in all three axes.  
\>Solid, fun, precise sub-bass and bass.  
\>Clear, present, and layered mids.

*-Cons:*  
\>Cable connections are not interchangeable.  
\>The gold filter makes the high frequencies aggressive.  
\>Treble a little compressed.  
\>The cable slider doesn‚Äôt stay fixed.

**Disclaimer:**

This set of monitors was provided by the brand **Kefine** and **Mr. Yang**. I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to try one of their products at no cost and that no conditions were imposed when writing this analysis.

The price at the time of writing this analysis is approximately **65‚Ç¨**.

Despite this, my priority is to be as impartial as possible within the subjectivity involved in analyzing an audio product. My opinion belongs only to me and is developed according to my preferences. If you have a different one, it is equally valid. Please feel free to share it.

**Introduction:**

The **Delci AE** is the revision of the previous model with the same name. I am unaware of its performance as I didn‚Äôt have the chance to try it; I only know that, in this variant, the brand **Angelears** was involved.

My surprise was huge upon listening to them for the first time. It is my first contact with the brand. The name **Kefine** and the models **Klean** and **Delci** in my language (Spanish) sound like cleanliness, refinement, sweetness, something subtle‚Ä¶ but I found something mischievous, that hits hard in your ears, far from the neutrality that its name inspired in me before placing them on my ears.

**Will they meet my tastes?**

First, let‚Äôs look at the **package contents:**

\-This set comes in an elegant, unpretentious, minimalist little **box**. The name and image of the IEM. Nothing else is needed. Inside there is another box with the logo and presentation of the accessories.  
\-User **manual**.  
\-A rigid carrying and storage **case**.  
\-Two sets of **ear tips** with open and closed bore in various sizes.  
\-A set of **filters**: gold to increase the higher frequencies and silver to add some color to the mids and lows.  
\-A 1.2m oxygen-free copper **cable** with silver-plated copper, wrapped in plastic that is pleasant to the touch and not sticky. Terminations available in 3.5mm and 4.4mm. The earpieces have 0.78mm connections.  
\-The two **capsules**, made of aluminum alloy and finished with precision and uniformity, without highlighting imperfections. They feel robust but are extremely light.

**They look comfortable, right?**

This is where we start. Comfort must be valued above any other aspect.

The answer is affirmative. It is the most comfortable my ears have ever worn. The first smile I got was because of this. My contact with the **Delci AE** couldn‚Äôt have started better.

The capsules are light by design, size leaning more toward small than medium or large. I believe they could fit well in anyone‚Äôs auricle and ear canal.

For this, the included tips do a remarkable job: they are comfortable, of quality in line with competitors in this price range, and achieve a perfect seal, so not a single note escapes your eardrums.

The cable helps the overall feeling of comfort. I simply ask this element not to be bothersome, and the one included in the **Delci AE** package not only does not bother, but is light, fits well behind your ears, doesn‚Äôt tangle, and doesn‚Äôt pull by catching on your clothing.

I don‚Äôt know much about cables. I like them or not depending on the discomfort they produce, and these, I like.

What I didn‚Äôt find so pleasant was the slider, which simply doesn‚Äôt fix its position, but who needs a slider if the cable does its job well? Not me, at least.

**Technical aspects:**

\-Dynamic Driver (**1DD**) 10mm with metal coating  
\-**Sensitivity** 108 dB  
\-**Impedance** 28 ohms  
\-**Frequency range** 20Hz to 20kHz

The **Delci AE** is very grateful with any source, although I always recommend at least a DAC dongle to gain a bit more power and, above all, cleanliness.

I would pair it with a device that adds a little more color, like **FiiO KA11**, which highlights the virtues of this **Kefine** model, but this is only according to my personal tastes.

Nevertheless, the vast majority of my listening to draw conclusions was with more neutral sources, like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**.

**Sound signature:**

These **Kefine** monitors truly leave me bewildered if I have to draw conclusions by looking at the graph.

My experience with the gold filter is a V-shaped signature, with a peak in the high zone that exceeded my tastes, becoming somewhat annoying due to the uncontrolled result. The mids were recessed, but substantially well-defined, and the low end maintained a fun touch in its bass, although I missed more body and punch in the sub-bass.

I could control the treble by adding a **FiiO KA11**, with a warm character, which significantly slowed the high zone‚Äôs intensity, achieving more clarity in listening, but losing detail in the midrange.

However, the tuning that ended up enchanting me, and over which I will analyze these **Kefine** monitors, is with the silver filter and a neutral source like **FiiO K11** and **FiiO KA13**. At this point, I believe the **Delci AE** abandons a V-Shaped signature and becomes something warm/neutral or L-Shaped.

*Sub-bass*: one of the features that made me adore these monitors. The sub-impact is overwhelming, with solid extension, exceptionally defined rumble. Its attack isn‚Äôt the fastest, leaving extra moments to savor it. A zone that has been lovingly rounded to provide enjoyment.

*Bass:* musical, but also technical. Hits fast and doesn‚Äôt interfere with the midrange, even in dense mixes. They have the body and texture needed to excite and the resolution to perceive details clearly.

*Low mids:* may seem recessed because they are not intended to be the focus and are usually overshadowed by the sub-bass. They add warmth and contour to listening. I found them well-defined, with clear presence but not overly incisive.

*Mids:* their instrumental separation is noteworthy despite being somewhat contained. They don‚Äôt feel distant nor too forward. I consider them positioned enough to reveal their splendor, close to neutrality, showing moderation and naturalness.

*Upper mids:* another highlight, with enough prominence to handle many instruments without saturating the listening, and with quick attack to reveal details and sounds that were always there but unnoticed. Energetic, yet tamed sibilance. Allow highly satisfying enjoyment without annoyance or fatigue. Vocals in this range are clear, well-articulated, and lack no resolution.

*Treble:* not excessively bright, which I appreciate, but energetic and demanding presence. I find quite some air and some detail, but micro-detail can be lost due to control with the silver filter. In my opinion, I don‚Äôt need more, nor do I want it.

*Very low male vocals:* excellent presence thanks to the monitors‚Äô tuning. Proper timbre and precise articulation. Premium sensation.

*Normal male vocals:* natural but rounded, full-bodied, clarifying, properly positioned for absolute resolution.

*Female vocals:* warm and pleasant, containing brightness effectively to leave clarity and detail in its right measure.

Regarding **soundstage**, I perceive it as average, maybe slightly above for depth and height, but not in horizontal width. Still, the sensation of being enveloped by musical chords is noticeable.

**Imaging** is more analytical and precise. I applaud the excellent positioning of instruments and vocals, especially if the track is high quality and well-recorded, greatly enhancing the pleasant sensation of being surrounded by music.

Regarding **layering**: I don‚Äôt know what kind of black magic they applied in this dynamic driver. It was so astonishing that I still can‚Äôt believe how a product of this price, after testing many **1DD** configurations, achieves such results in layered and revealing representation of different frequencies and sound elements.

Regarding **detail retrieval**, another excellent result. Despite emphasizing the low zone, it maintains perfect balance between weight and clarity, never feeling congested.

Now let‚Äôs talk about **performance in single-player games.** No spoilers, of course.

I encourage you to consult the conditions under which I analyze headphones, always aiming for the most cinematic experience possible, as well as video game scenes, in the [following link to my blog](https://short.do/-_rRhL)

The source used for this was **FiiO K11**, filter #5, and medium gain.

In the soundstage test in *Red Dead Redemption 2*, with male voices at different depth distances, the result was pleasantly satisfactory. The dynamic blizzard in the horizontal plane was resolved correctly, showing side-to-side movement accurately and achieving an enveloping effect worthy of praise. Regarding male voices, the layering precisely showed the different depths from which dialogues were emitted, with a frontal and emphasized tone. Timbre was naturally as expected.

In *God of War Ragnarok* and the sub-bass rumble test, I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied with the result, giving sensations of being immersed in the canyon scene, feeling rocks detaching from the mountain and hitting the ground overwhelmingly and realistically, leaving a very pleasant lingering enjoyment in your brain for a few milliseconds.

Regarding Kratos‚Äô very deep and low voice, it was represented with very accurate detail, faithful to what you would expect from a rough demigod, showing depth and roughness.

In the chaotic situations test of *Dark Souls III*, where boss fights mix soundtrack, enemy screams, floor impacts, and axe strikes, frequency layering was highly gratifying. I could enjoy the orchestral OST clearly while distinguishing each element that played. It wasn‚Äôt the highest resolution experience I‚Äôve heard but was highly satisfying. Where other IEMs fail, the **Delci AE** kept its head above water.

Speaking of dialogues, these IEMs are clearly in a territory where they handle themselves easily. In *A Plague Tale Requiem*, the adult female voice was resolved with appropriate timbre, maybe slightly lacking purity and brightness, but performed acceptably.

The child and teenage male voices were heard with a high and clear tone for the first, showing expected expressiveness, and the second, deeper than the first, full of resonant nuances and pleasantly controlled.

Continuing with the same game, in the specific positioning test, I was pleasantly surprised: they achieved clear and precise localization of direction and position of sound, beneficial when playing games where stealth is key.

And let‚Äôs go to the hardest test. A test I never exclude because it‚Äôs the best I have and a tough exam for headphones: the high-frequency test in *Final Fantasy XVI.*

Well, I know that placing the silver filter eliminates the sibilance I got with the gold. Although controlling the highest frequencies is a plus for me, I can understand that reducing detail and brightness may be negative for others.

Nevertheless, my auditory comfort is above any factor, and although performance in this range isn‚Äôt the best for purists since listening wasn‚Äôt fully revealing, one can feel energy and appreciate certain details. I appreciate that the filter change drastically controls this high zone despite feeling some bottleneck and lack of information.

**Final conclusions:**

I don‚Äôt want to be carried away by the excitement of having found what is, for me, the best (so far) single dynamic driver IEM I‚Äôve tested. At least up to the **100‚Ç¨/USD** threshold. I imagine that beyond that budget, there are better things. I want to believe so, because what‚Äôs the point of spending more money?

I acknowledge it isn‚Äôt perfect. In fact, technically, it‚Äôs inferior to two other competitors in its price range I‚Äôve already analyzed, but neither of those two gave me the fun that the **Delci AE** did. And I came to enjoy, not to squeeze every note or chord or deliberately find faults (which I also did with these monitors) to have a reason to speak poorly of a product or deduct points. I‚Äôm not a cold, analytical person but full of drive and feelings. I prefer asking forgiveness rather than permission. And with these IEMs, I found a perfect companion for both my favorite music and my video games.

They have everything I look for: powerful low-end punch, extending rumble spectacularly but not artificially, well-articulated, detailed vocals with largely natural timbre, instrumentation really present and well-placed despite midrange sinking, and a high end that doesn‚Äôt hurt with excess brightness and energy, allowing some details to be captured without feeling something is missing. Little is pleasing, too much tires.

My sincerest congratulations to the brand.

Thank you for reading if you‚Äôve made it this far.

1oi2nx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1oi2nx2/my_father_died_he_may_not_have_been_who_i_thought/,My father died; he may not have been who I thought he was. (Part 1),"I remember vividly the precise moment in which I learned of my father's death. It was bitterly cold as the clock struck three in the morning, winter rain pounded mercilessly against the windows of the little apartment I shared with my best friend in the world, who had, without my knowing it, in an instant become the only person I had left in the world. Those misty panes of glass all around our small home rattled in the freezing wind that blew through town that night, carrying the icy rain with it as if searching for something, or someone. It was a mournful climate that had taken the city at that hour, the sky beating at the earth with wailing winds and raging rain. Perhaps the world itself had known before even I had learned of the events that had occurred mere hours before.

When my phone rang and faintly broke through the roaring downpour outside, waking me up with a sharp noise unlike the muffled rumble of the winter storm roaring through the night, I took a moment to let it ring so that I could determine who was calling me at three in the morning. There was no caller ID. I nearly let my head drop back onto my pillow, but I answered the call intending to give the person on the other end a piece of my mind if they turned out to be a scam-artist or some sort.

""Is this Lukas Woode speaking?"" a pleasant-sounding woman asked as soon as I had groggily mumbled a greeting. I had to turn my phone's volume up as far as it would go to hear her over the weather. Once I confirmed my identity, the woman spoke again, keeping a brisk and chipper tone despite the hour, though she sounded significantly less cold as she continued. ""I'm afraid I may have some bad news for you. Earlier this evening, a man was reported dead on the scene of a traffic accident, and we have since verified that that man was Markus Woode. Your name was the one he claimed as his next of kin. Do you know the man I'm speaking of?""

I don't remember what I said next, if I said anything at all. What I do remember is that the woman on the phone told me who it was that had called me, which was all I had really cared about at the time. I hung up the phone and dressed myself quickly, loudly, uncaring as to whether or not I woke my roommate and friend, Adam. I thundered out of the house in simple clothes that were soaked through quickly in the rain. I had no car to drive myself to the hospital, and neither did Adam, so I walked. Ran, more like it. The brutal rain and wind harassed me from all sides as if I alone was its target, but the deafening roar and numbing cold weren't the things that fogged up my mind, sapped all the warmth from my veins, froze my heart in my chest even as it hammered louder than any storm. To my mind, there was nothing that mattered except myself and the road, and my father at the end of it.

Fifteen minutes later, I crashed through the front entrance of the forensic medical centre, walking water and mud into the tile of the lobby. The woman at the desk spoke with the voice I had heard on the phone when we spoke. I could have been more polite to her, but I suppose she dealt with more than a few distressed people working where she did, and so she went to speak with one of the forensic examiners, a doctor that introduced himself with a name I did not care to commit to memory when we spoke some time later. The doctor escorted me through the halls of his workplace and brought me to the man they thought was my father. A fraction of my heart, a heart that was screaming at me from within my own head even though it sounded as distant as the rain that had soaked me to the bone in transit, still did not quite believe that my father really was dead. I didn't know what he was, if not, but I needed to see it to believe.

The room I was led to was dark, the overhead light only faintly illuminating the room even at such a time as three-thirty in the morning. That flickering bulb buzzed and hummed as it struggled to stay alight. The black tile of the floor drank in and swallowed that weak light, dull and lacking shine as my wet shoes squealed against them. The similarly dark walls made the small room appear to lack borders, as if I could have stepped off the tile and into black nothingness, a void that pushed in on my senses as I stepped closer to the middle of the room. A table stood in the middle of the black, morbid space, lengths and surfaces of silver that did gleam in the dying light from above, covered in a thin white sheet that conformed to a humanoid shape underneath. I approached the table and hovered above that shape, but hesitated to uncover it and see for myself.

The doctor did it for me. He brought the sheet down to expose the shape's head, and I was forced to grip the table so that I my knees did not buckle. My father and I had always looked alike. I had his nose, straight and narrow, though his had been broken a number of times, his pale skin and eyes, though his were far paler than I hoped mine would ever be as the pallor of death had washed over him, and his dark, thick hair, some of which was missing from his head along with fragments of his scalp. I gagged, and would have emptied my stomach if it had had anything in it. The ghostly image of my deceased father drove me to silent tears as I confirmed for the doctor that they had gotten the details of his identity correct.

A torrent of emotion tore at me until I had nothing left to give to that scouring rush of insane grief that left me feeling mad in its wake. It was about ten minutes later that I could stand without leaning on the table that supported the corpse that had once been a father to me mere hours ago, when I had been wrung out and robbed of all the emotion that I found it possible to express at three o'clock in the morning. It was only then, when my mind had been emptied of all preoccupation and I was utterly vacant, that my mind latched onto detail that was unfamiliar to me. The patches of his scalp that had been torn from his skull. The slash across his cheek. The burn that had left his ear a melted mass of skin and cartilage. I briefly wondered if it might have been a trick of the light, but my eyes caught on one thing in particular among my father's many small injuries.

Black stained his neck, covering his skin in long, flowing lines that streaked his flesh in the pattern of veins. I pulled the sheet down further to expose his shoulders, and the left shoulder bore the same pattern snaking down around the joint through the skin and further along his torso. I attempted to pull the sheet down even more to investigate more thoroughly, but the doctor stopped me with a hand on my wrist when I tried.

""I understand that you may be curious, but I am still conducting my examination,"" the doctor said with his imperious, cold manner of speaking. ""If you wish, I can send you the results of my examination, once it is done, but until then, I apologise, but there is no more that you can do to aid us in our work.""

I said nothing more except to apologise to the woman at the front desk on my way out for tracking dirt in upon my arrival, and left. On my way home, I walked through the rain again, but I wasn't concerned with getting sick or with the cold. What in the world could have done all of that to my dad's body? They had said that he'd died in a traffic accident, but anyone who knew my father would have known that that was nonsense. For one thing, my father had never driven a car in his life; we had lived in such a walkable city that neither of us had ever really needed to learn how. For another, he hadn't left his house in months after slowly transitioning into an early retirement from his job as a private investigator. He was only fifty-four, but his active lifestyle was catching up to him fast, so he had decided to check out early. What had he been doing out and about?

The real burning question was one I was almost afraid to even ask. What could have caused that strange black marking on his skin? That wasn't natural. My father hadn't had any skin conditions that I had known of, and it didn't look like scarring, so what? That was the thing that stuck with me as I stomped up the stairs of my apartment complex and clumsily dried my shoes before entering once again. I only stayed awake long enough to change out of my wet clothes and halfway dry my hair before I passed out in bed just as the clock struck four-thirty. It was indeed the the very early morning of the eighteenth of September, and even if my father might have died before midnight, I had only learned of it once the date had changed. What a wonderful twenty-seventh birthday gift.

When I woke up in the morning, I had a more in-depth conversation with the forensic medical examiner, and after that came to realise something that hadn't occurred to me before. As I was an only child and my mother passed many years ago, and my father hadn't remarried and had no living family at all other than myself ‚Äî Magnus Woode had never been a family man ‚Äî I was the sole inheritor of all his worldly possessions, as was later explained to me by the executor of my father's will, a lawyer he had saved from false accusations of malpractice back in the day, when he'd still been working as a PI.

Thus, I spent my birthday ‚Äî which usually would have been spent with Adam getting so drunk that I could taste colours ‚Äî combing through my father's house to mark what I wanted to keep and what I wanted to sell, since it was all mine now, including the house. My father had owned the place and, after I checked my bank that afternoon and realised that I'd inherited all the money he'd saved up over his long, lucrative career, it would be paid off for a long while if I didn't do anything stupid.

The house itself was an ancient place right in the heart of the city, hidden away between an office building and a sprawling manor that once had been the estate of a wealthy family before being renovated into a museum dedicated to the history and culture of the city. The outside of the place was narrow and tall, dark even as a bright, pale winter sun shone down on it with its sterile light, its aged wooden frame seeming to sway slightly in the breeze, or perhaps that was an optical illusion given the building's decrepit looks. I had only visited a few times since my father had bought the place, which had been when I had gone off to college almost ten years ago, so it was still mostly unfamiliar to me. Adam had volunteered to come along with me and help out with the sorting of things, but I turned him down. This was something I felt I had to do on my own.

The inside of the house was equally as dark and grimy. The house was so old that there were no overhead lights, so I had to take a quick trip to the store to buy flashlights; I wasn't about to waste my phone batteries, not when I was expecting more calls throughout the day. I went from room to room, exploring and marking everything that wasn't nailed down as something to sell or something to keep. I don't remember exactly what I had expected, but I was done by ten o'clock, and most of the work was able to be done in a sort of haze, going around and more or less absently judging everything that my father had owned for the last nine years of his life without expending much effort. My father had always been the kind of man to place little value on material possessions. A phone call with the executor of the will later confirmed that the entirety of the material collection I'd been left was indeed simply the house and everything in it, as little as that really was.

The mundanity and monotony of it lulled me into a state close to falling asleep on my feet, especially after seeing my father's body just hours before in the small hours of the morning, which had been such a shock to the system that my sleep after that point had been horrible and filled with horrible dreams I can still only half-remember. What brought me out of that state was discovering a door where I had never known there was one. The door was found right at the end of the long, narrow hallway that curved slightly to the right due to what I assumed was an error during the house's construction, which was shrouded in darkness even as I focused my flashlight on it from down the hall's meandering length. I walked down and opened the door, opening up a passageway I had never realised was there.

The door let out into a flight of stairs that curved and twisted around itself. The steps of the staircase moaned under my weight, and the frame of the twisting stairwell definitely swayed slightly as *I* descended the dusty corkscrew of steps. At the bottom, the stairs let out into a small basement that was even darker than upstairs had been due to the absence of windows and any sort of natural lighting. It was so dark that the beam of my flashlight seemed to dim slightly when I shone it into the room, as if the shadows in there were eating away at the brightness, or perhaps as if the light was fleeing the dark. The second I crossed the threshold into the room, goosebumps erupted all over my skin and I shivered in the cold that made all the hair on my body stand on end. I looked around vaguely, as if I would see anything outside the area my flashlight illuminated, which shrank the further I pushed into the room.

That basement must have been older than the rest of the house, given the rotted wooden beams holding up the ceiling, and the musty, stale air that made me cough and wheeze until I caught my breath. Dust swirled around my feet when I walked, and the floor was smooth, paved stone or hard packed earth, rather than wooden floorboards. There was nothing down there except for a decaying old stand made out of a dark wood that was glossy and shone like marble under the glow of my flashlight, and something that gleamed with a purity that was out of place in this disintegrating place, something that was placed atop the stand like a holy relic upon a pedestal. I approached it and shone my flashlight down onto it from above as I took a good look.

It was a book. The tome was thick, the yellowed pages within rested slightly unaligned with each other, giving it a homemade look. The covers were pitch black leather, matte and unreflective as it consumed the light I shone onto it. What did shine was the gilding on the front cover. It was silver leaf, gleaming and bright and pure, arranged in the shape of an eye that possessed a disquieting air of intellect, within a gilded noose that twisted around itself and closed in around the eye, whose pupil was a void of black leather at the very middle of the cover. The hair on my head stood on end, my usually messy, dark hair straightening out as it floated above my head when I moved to touch the book. Blood roared in my ears as my heart thudded in my chest, my limbs buzzes with energy as a charge filled the air around me, like electricity given form. My chest burned as I tried to breathe and couldn't suck in air. All these phenomena grew more sever the closer my hand came to touching the book.

What on earth was this thing, and why was it inducing such a reaction in me? I had no clue as to what I was provoking by doing this, but all of a sudden, my sleep-deprived and emotionally fatigued brain decided that this was the time for anger. This was my house now, this was my basement, and this was my book by association. I had lost more than I had really come to terms with just hours ago, and I was not in the mood for this. I owned all of this. That book was mine. I could touch it if I liked. And, with that, I did touch it.

The book was smooth to the touch, and had the feel of moisture even though the cover was as dry as everything else down in that basement. The silver gilding on the cover was cool, enough to sting slightly, and hard. The instant I pressed my hand down onto the cover of that book, thunder boomed overhead, the sound of the sky striking the earth, and the charge that had built in the air was released in a rush of air that was colder than I have words to describe. The foundations of the house shook, the rotted beams supporting the ceiling groaned, and the staircase wobbled. Distant, muffled impacts, rain landing upon the roof of the house in chaotic rhythm, drew my eyes upward. The load-bearing beams and boards that held the house up above my head creaked and groaned, and the floorboards of the ceiling ‚Äî which was the living room's floor, if my memory of the house's layout was accurate ‚Äî visibly flexed under their own weight.

I cradled the book in my arms and ran to the staircase just as another roaring crack of thunder rang out directly above the house, by the sounds of it. The foundations of the house trembled again, and the tearing of decayed wood filled my ears as the ceiling collapsed right behind me. I pulled myself up the staircase that churned and protested loudly, and flung myself up to the ground floor as fast as I could. When I stumbled out of the stairwell, I half-sprinted and half-staggered through the hall and out into the living room in a panicked daze. A thrill shot up my spine as I looked upon the destruction wrought by whatever it was that had just happened. The entire floor of the living room, which had supported a coffee table, a recliner, and a television, had caved in within a matter of seconds, and I laughed out loud as exhausted mania took me. I was having an insane day, and the only way I knew to stave off the despair and terror was to laugh.

Looking down at the book, I turned it over in my hands. The back cover was gilded in silver just like the front, but the image it made was vastly different. The image the back cover bore was that of a great tree with nine branches and three roots, all gnarled and twisted together to form a great clustered web of natural life. Upon the tree were perched three groups of three birds, each with one little eye, though what kind of bird I couldn't discern. There was a kind of hum to the book, like the charge from before but less intense, though it still gave me goosebumps. It pulsed in a rhythm, which was identical to the rhythm of the thunder roaring thousands of metres above my head. It was the rhythm of a heartbeat ‚Äî *my* heartbeat. The charge of the book, the thunder shattering the sky above, the waves of rain soaking through the ancient wooden structure around me, it all came with the irregular heartbeat rhythm of my own fear.

An immense impact made me jump halfway out of my skin and yelp in shock and fear. That did *not* come with the tempo of my heartbeat. Neither did the sound of scattering, broken glass a second later. Making my way to the source of the sound, I discovered that a window in the kitchen had been shattered and the glass thrown across the floor around a bird that frantically flapped its wings for a moment before slowing and falling still. Blood began to pool around the dark bird, and its dead eyes fell on me in its final moment. It was a large, black bird with a gleaming beak and a shock of feathers around its neck that rose like a dog's hackles as it died; using my limited knowledge of avian species, I decided that it was a raven and not a crow.

Between crashes of thunder, this time accompanied by the flash of lightning outside that lit up the dark kitchen for less than a second, the croaking call of another raven drifted in from right outside the window. And then another. And another. And yet another. In a flash of blue-white lightning that cast deep shadows across the alley between my father's house and the office building beside it, I caught sight of black shapes circling around above the dark, gaunt building. Dozens of raven's calls were drowned out by the subsequent crash of thunder, louder than all the rest before it, as the house shook once again.

I hesitated for a moment to leave that house, a monument to my father, but my choice was made for me by the tidal wave of black feathers that pounded against every window of the house in an unrelenting surge of corvid suicide. The reverberating sound of glass shattering from every angle drove me to run, but I had hesitated too long. The ravens came for me while I was running through the main hall, diving and scratching at me, trying to catch me in the face with their razor-sharp claws and beaks. I screamed as my face erupted with scorching pain, and I tried to swat the ravens away from me using the weight of the book to bat them aside as I fled. The house shuddered in time with my quickening heartbeat as the thunder and lightning above surged, and the second I stepped outside with the book in hand, my vision was filled with blue-white light that came with a boom that took my hearing. My attackers disappeared as if struck down by the lightning.

Staggering onto the street and quickly becoming drenched by the driving rain that fell upon my at an angle propelled by the mournful winds that wailed as they blew, I turned back around and stared at what had become of the one material possession my father had bequeathed to me. From the very peak of the lonely, frail, ancient house, sparks flew and caught on the wooden panels making up its roof, upon which started a fire. Somehow, despite the rain and the wind and the cold, the wooden house all succumbed to flames, one wooden board catching and spreading it to the next, until black smoke began to waft into the air and sirens rang out from a distant street. Blinking rapidly so that my vision would properly clear up, I surveyed the small yard in front of the house to find dozens of shrivelled, black forms of a vaguely avian shape laid about as they let off a foul smoke that smelled of burning oil.

Panic took me then. Where did I go from there? What did I do with the book? What even was the book? Why had any of that happened the way it did? I had a hundred questions and no answers, so I tried to think of a course of action that I could take that would give me any semblance of comfort. My first thought was to get the book out of the rain so that I could have a chance to investigate it further at home once things calmed down. However, once I took a good look at it, I discovered that although I had become drenched from head to toe in the rain, the book had stayed perfectly dry. As I watched, the drops of water falling from above touched the book and seemed to slide around and off of it as I had seen from hydrophobic substances in high school science classes. The book was totally fine. Unfortunately, I was not, as the rain made the scratches and punctures on my face from the ravens' attacks sting even more.

I did not get all the time I would've liked to think about my next move. As storm clouds gathered overhead, winged shapes emerged from all around and began to circle around the flaming ruins of my father's old house and croak at my from the air. My feet pounded against the hard sidewalk as I sprinted away down the street, clutching the book close to my chest and pushing my tired body to move as fast as it could, which was not amazingly fast even at the best of times. This was decidedly not the best of times. I slipped and slid along the slick pavement as I ducked and dodged under attacks from ravens that tried to claw or peck my eyes out. One got my eyebrow, which stung so much that I actually shouted out in pain as its nasty little claws broke the skin in three shallow lines just above my eye, but no damage was done, so I pushed on.

The walk home was too far to make it on foot while being pursued by a whole flock of ravens. Did you know that the collective noun for a group of ravens is called an *unkindness*? I had away blown that little tid-bit off as a joke told by kids who wanted to sound smarter than they really were, but as I ran what felt like the length of a city while under attack from bloodthirsty corvids, I began to understand why they were called that. I needed a place to hide, and I needed it quickly. My only problem was that I didn't know any nearby shelters. I scrambled to maintain my footing on the slippery sidewalk as I pivoted on the spot into an alley and managed to shake off the murderous birds for only a few moments before their airborne agility allowed them to easily catch back up with me.

There was one idea that I could try, but I had no idea whether or not it would've worked, and what I needed in my life right then and there was just a little bit of certainty. I decided to take the risk anyway. There was no other choice; it was the closest place I could think of.

The church came into view as I turned a corner and smacked one of the ravens so hard that a sound like crunching paper came from its body as it tumbled toward the ground and went still. I had managed to outrun the storm that had started over my father's home; the dark, flashing clouds gathered above me had in fact been centred on the house, and not on me, or the book. I had no idea how the book was relevant, but I was sure it was. I didn't slow down as I crossed the street, and I may have even sped up a little bit as my goal drew closer with every step. Narrowly dodging a car or two didn't slow me down either as I slammed into the massive double doors of the haunting, pale building that stabbed up at the darkening sky with spires and towers that seemed fit for a castle. The dark wooden doors opened when I pushed hard on them, and I all but fell inside before scrambling to my feet and leaving the book on the marble floor to slam the doors shut behind me and lock the ravens outside.

I leaned against the door and slid down to sit with my back against the cold, hard wooden barrier between myself and the flock of ravens outside. My shoes slipped and screeched on the smooth floor of the church as a puddle of rain water gathered beneath me. As that puddle grew out from the floor beneath me as my soaked clothes dripped onto the marble, the swell of water warped itself around the book that I had dropped on the floor, the puddle grew *around* the book so that the tome would not get wet. Before, I had thought the book was simply waterproof, and so I'd had the ability to ignore it. As I sat and stared at the book, watching as the water flowed out from under me in every direction and flowed *around* the book and *only* the book, my theory that the book was somehow relevant to everything that had happened at the house started to solidify as fact in my mind.

A booming, drawling voice ‚Äî it wasn't deep, but it did hold a resonance that helped it carry ‚Äî rang out in the silence that had blanketed the inside of the church since my arrival. ""It seems the Lord has sent us a guest.""

Looking around, I don't know what I had expected, but the church looked unlike anything I had anticipated. The first thing that surprised me was that it was occupied. The central nave lined with pews was packed with dozens of people of all ages, some of which clustered together as the younger ones shied away from my dishevelled self as if sheltering family from a danger. Those dozens upon dozens of people were lit up by rays of multicoloured light, beams filtered through the stained glass that warped the sunlight that hit them; the storm had not yet reached this place. At the far end of the hall, the sanctuary with its altar loomed above and apart from those who had gathered together in prayer before my entrance. The lectern upon the altar held a Bible that laid open as a lector stared at me from all the way across the church. Behind that lector, the massive crucifix bearing the depiction of Jesus Christ towered over everyone, and Christ seemed to stare down at me in particular. It made me feel small and vulnerable despite my victory over the ravens.

""Sorry, everyone,"" I stammered. I stood and clutched the book to my chest since I didn't have to worry about it getting wet. ""Didn't mean to interrupt, I promise, I just needed to ‚Ä¶ get out of the rain."" I gestured vaguely to my drenched self and hoped they wouldn't ask me to elaborate and come up with a lie.

""That's alright, friend,"" the lector said, holding his arms out in what looked like an attempt to calm the congregation. ""We are welcoming of all who seek shelter from misfortune.""

A small shape passed over one of the stained glass windows, fluttering by and casting a long shadow over the pews before it was gone in an instant. I stared at the window as the relief that had washed over me dried up just as fast as that shape moved. Shifting on my feet brought another squealing whine from my soaked shoes, and made me wince. I went and sat on one of the pews closest to the entrance that was empty; I didn't want to bother anyone with a puddle. My wet clothes made too much sound for my liking when I moved, and the staring didn't bring me any more comfort. If it was a miracle that I hadn't gotten sick after exposing myself to the elements last night, I was tempting fate doing it again just seven or so hours later.

The lector continued his speaking when I was seated. ""For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground; yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he? As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up: So man lieth down, and riseth not: Till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep. O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me! If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.""

Two minutes could have passed as I sat and listened, or perhaps two hours. The lector's words were eventually drowned out in my mind, and perhaps my mind only, by the low, raspy croak of a calling raven that just barely penetrated through the closed windows. I stared at the window that had briefly been thrown into shadow by a passing shape in the air. That distant call made my blood run cold, and my hands tightened around the book as I peered down at it and was tempted to finally look inside. Before I could look, though, I flinched as an impact rattled one of the stained glass windows with an immense BANG. The congregation stared as a black shape fell from the window, causing shadows to shift along them, and I stood when I realised what was happening.

The lector said, ""Well, that was certainly surprising,"" in what must have been an attempt to soothe the people, but they began to murmur among themselves anxiously. Another impact, this time on the other side of the building, slammed against the stained glass and caused another fright among the churchgoers. A third raven flattened itself against another window, and another, and another, until the stained glass began to crack and chip. My entire body throbbed in time with the pulse of the book, in time with the impacts hammering at the windows. Over the panicking congregation, I met the lector's eyes, and his face tightened as his faze fell on me and shifted down to the book that, despite its pulsing charge, was still as cold as it had ever been. I began to understand that none of my body heat transferred to the thick tome despite the length of time that I had held it in my hands.

A surge of black feathers broke through the stained glass, dark raven's blood splattering across the congregation's faces and backs as they flinched away from the scattering glass that sent flashes of every colour imaginable across the church. The waves of black poured into the building like a liquid and flowed through the air, but not toward me, even as I staggered back and fell over as I tipped over the pew. The flock of ravens filled the air above the pews and altar, and the lector shouted, ""Please stay calm, friends! You may evacuate through the front doors!"" The congregation all moved as one mass, flooding the aisle between the rows of pews and sprinting forth to escape the black-winged invasion of their holy place.

The ravens dove, but not at any person. They swarmed around the crucifix, the depiction of Jesus Christ, croaking and crying their sickening calls as they assaulted the symbol of divinity looming over me. The dark attackers clawed the son of God's eyes out, and scratched at his hands and feet, and pecked holes into his sides. Stigmata, the legendary, Biblical wounds suffered by Christ, had been inflicted upon his image once again. I had never been a devout man, my mother had not raised me to believe in any one thing and now that I'm thinking about it, I don't know what my father believed. That no longer mattered. A terror like none I had ever experienced before, dread colder than the worst winter and panic hotter than even the sun, streaked through me in a lightning strike of fear.

That lector, I regret never learning his name, gathered up a broom and attempted to dissuade the ravens from attacking the symbol of his faith, and paid the price. The few birds he managed to strike with the length of his broom swerved in the air and dove at him, and the arms he threw up to defend himself were not enough. I started forward for a few steps before freezing abruptly as goosebumps erupted along my arms at the sight of what those foul corvids did to that poor man. Nausea threatens to rob me of the contents of my stomach even thinking about it now. By the end of it, the lector who had welcomed me into his place of worship was an eyeless mess of blood running down his face, which was frozen in the terror that had taken him in his final moments; his hands were pierced right through the palms, and his shoes had been torn apart and the soles of his feet had been punched through as well. The sides of his torso had been penetrated by those razor beaks and forced wide enough for his innards to spill out onto the altar he collapsed upon.

The lector screamed as he writhed in pain from suffering through the wounds as his lord had two thousand years ago, through which that lord's depiction had been destroyed anew just moments ago, as I would be destroyed if I stayed. With tears in my eyes ‚Äî I had never seen a person die before ‚Äî I turned and ran out the doors with everyone else. The sunlight outside blinded me for a moment, just long enough for me to run head-first into a person and stagger back with an apology. As my eyes adjusted, I kept on running, my frantic eyes scanning everything around me in my panic. A hundred ravens or more circled above the church as the ones inside defaced the image of Christ and ate away at the lector. The pulsing of the book beat in time with the rhythm of my sprint down the street toward home. The fatigue of sleep-deprivation and bodily exhaustion was beginning to catch up with me, and my staggering gait was slow and sluggish, but enough to take me away from the ravens, who for some foul reason seemed more interested in the church than myself. For now.

The black, oily smoke pouring into the sky in a thin, faint plume was distant and faded by that time, but I could pinpoint my position in the city relative to my father's old house using it as a north star. Firefighters must have arrived to the scene and tamed the blaze by now, but there was no way that I was going to go back there. Home. That was the only place I had left. That would, however, put Adam, the only *person* I had left, in danger if the ravens followed me there. My mind screamed questions at me as my body simply moved without conscious input. Where to go? What to do? Who to trust with this? What even was this? Why was this happening to me? Was it the book? How was my father connected to this? Why now? I had no answers for any of it. There was one thing I knew for certain, though; I needed rest, and to rest, I needed to go home.

As soon as I exploded into our shared apartment, Adam, who'd been sitting on the couch watching a movie, shouted in outrage. He went to say something if the look in his eye as I violently locked the front door told me anything, but he seemed to realise something at the last second and abandoned his complaint. ""Why are you drenched?"" he asked as I marched across our living room.

""I'll explain,"" I promised as I gently laid the black-and-silver book, the ancient tome that was my only real material inheritance from my father, on the coffee table. ""First, help me make sure all the windows are closed.""

Adam stared at me like I was crazy. I certainly *felt* crazy. ""Why?""

""Just do it!"" I roared, and I must have looked even crazier for it, because he immediately complied.

As we went around our apartment and ensured that all the windows were shut and locked where that was possible, I calmed down a little bit. The ravens could have broken the glass if they had really wanted to get in, but that was what I could do in the moment to secure our home against the corvid stalkers, and it helped me feel better. After that, I collapsed onto the sofa despite Adam's complaints about my half-dry clothes and breathlessly told him the story of my day so far. He seemed to think I was joking when I told of what had happened at my father's old house, but when I told of what had occurred at the church and we moments later heard sirens racing down the street outside in the direction of said church, Adam's face paled and he began pacing nervously.

""Assuming I believe you,"" he said with a incredulous scoff, ""what do we even do now?""

""I don't know,"" I said hoarsely. My voice was totally drained of emotion after all I'd been through during the nine hours since learning of my father's death at three o'clock that morning. My eyes never left the book as I talked, its cover of leathery midnight and its gilding of heavenly silver, arranged in that image of the eye within the loop of a noose. What in the world *was* it? ""I don't know."" I spoke more to myself than to Adam then.

I really did not know anything. About the book, about what had happened that day, and about my father, if his house was where all this had begun. It was becoming clear to me as the day went on that I may not have really known my father. That had always been obvious, we'd never been close because of his work; his investigative career had taken him across the country, everywhere except home, where my mother had fulfilled his true duty for him before her unexpected death over a decade ago. Why had my father had this book in his basement? Because I was sure the book had somehow *caused* everything with the storm and the ravens and the basement collapsing in on itself, how had it done that? What had those dark markings on my father's pale, dead flesh been?

I knew nothing. I didn't intend to stay ignorant, though. Looking up at Adam, the book between us on the table as I sat and he paced, I caught his attention with a sigh and asked him the question that changed our lives forever, and not for the better. I wish I hadn't, but I did. Because I did, what happened after that between us was and continues to be my fault. I acknowledge that now. However, in that moment, none of that mattered. I simply wanted a friend by my side as I navigated this frightening, unbelievable, insane time in my life. I didn't have my father to rely on anymore ‚Äî if I ever had in the first place ‚Äî and Adam was the only person in the world that I could trust with this. So I asked him. I asked, and doomed us both to what would come next.

I met her at a library and we both shared the BUSY school grind ambition. The vibes were there in person but we didn't talk much the first week and a half plus she was at a school conference out of state later that same week. She did show me pictures of her trip on our 1st date without me asking. About 1.5 weeks after meeting her was when we had our 1st date. I had invited her for a coffee/study session together but she was at the conference and eventually she ends up inviting me to go out dancing one night and says she would love for me to join her. We go out dancing as our first hangout and got to know each other more. I had a strong frame that night and before it was time for her to leave my car, she tells me she wants to make out. We make out and one thing leads the other. After our session, we stayed up til 6am in my car talking about life, and her sharing mostly about her past relationships. She tells me her last relationship was in May but didn't workout due to long distance and that the most recent time she had sex was with a guy friend she knew for 1 year before they started to hook up. Apparently they've hooked up at school multiple times and she told me that she's not emotionally attached to him and that it's only physical.. She told me how the person disappointed her by yelling at her one day for some reason and that she doesn't want to talk to him anymore and how he doesn't want to commit to something real. She even asked me at one point for advice on how to detach from someone.. I tend to have a good read on people at the beginning and besides that red flag, she's had good signs/traits I've been searching for in a woman up until the plot twist this story has at the end. I'm 30 yrs old and she's 24 yrs old. We're both on our career journeys.

We've only been talking for about two weeks but we have spent  
hours talking late at night in my car. We basically shared a lot about  
ourselves. 

Our times we've hung out: Met 3 weeks ago at library, Oct 6th

1. 1st date, went dancing & hooked up Oct 16th - (stayed up talking till 6am  after we hooked up)

2. Studied together, Oct 18th - (almost all day until 12am then talked in car until 3am)

3. Studied together, Oct 19th - (almost all day until  12am then talked in car until 3am)

4. Studied together, Oct 20th (for about 2.5 hrs)

5. Studied together, invited her to gym with me - Oct 22nd - (1:30pm - 11:30pm)

6. ""2nd real date"", Pumpkin Patch, Oct 25th  (1pm -  5:30pm)

7. An intentional late night link up, in her car this time Oct 26th (12:30am - 7am)

To make this story short, the day after the Pumpkin Patch, which was Sunday October 26th. I called her around 11am (wish I didn't bc the phone call lasted 50 min and we've never talked for that long plus I feel like it showed too much availability from me 1st thing in the am). She told me she was going to call me that night. (We talked about hooking up that night).

She calls me Sunday night and we decided to meet up and eventually hook up. This was our 2nd time hooking up and my 2nd time making out with her. When I would kiss her, I felt something I hadn't felt with anyone else in a very long time. For a sec I thought what if she's ""the one"" (since I'm dating with intention.) The continuous hangouts, personal long talks, really thought she was girlfriend material overall. She's family oriented and would ALWAYS leave her phone at the table faced up every time she would go use the restroom. She had shown genuine interest, was always transparent without me even asking, and reliable when I would call her. Mind you, we wouldn't text much these past couple of weeks it was more of like I would call her or she would call me to set things up. She even invited me to a couple of family things. One was to stop and say hi while she and her family pass out candy during Halloween. The other was to a relatives birthday party this past Saturday. (I couldn't make it)

In conclusion, after we hooked up we laid in the back seats of her SUV cuddling and being very affectionate towards each other, talking, kissing, even talked about a road-trip in her SUV sometime. I had to tell her again that I had to get going. Suddenly I found a condom wrapper in her backseat that wasn't mine. I nonchalant pointed it out and say that's awkward. I then step out to my car and then she steps out and we start talking. She always struck me as an honest person and says it was from 3-4 weeks ago with that guy she told me about. I told her to tell me when the last time she had sex with someone else and that's when she would say it was. I'm not good at lying and I feel like she's one of those ppl too. The eyes don't lie and I told her to tell me that even if it was last week it's not like we were exclusive. It didn't take much to have her admit it (like other girls in my past). She sighed and admitted that it was that same day in the morning after our phone call with the same guy she had told me about being FWB with. She said the condom wrapper was from 3-4 weeks ago but that she did hook up with the guy earlier that day. I asked her how come she didn't agree to hanging out with me another day like I suggested on the phone, she said she wanted to see me. She said she shouldn't have done that and that she was really sorry for what she did and for hurting me. She looked remorseful and teared up and said that she was trying to decompress ""us"" bc she wasn't sure of me if I was wanting something serious with her. She asked me how she can gain my trust back and that she would do anything to prove to me that when's she's in a committed relationship or when exclusivity is established that she doesn't sleep with anyone else. (She's mentioned this before) She said to give her a month to let her prove to me with her actions how loyal she can be. I was definitely hurt about it and expressed the betrayal to her but I was still very calm overall. I feel like most people would have left in a heartbeat but idk why I was still there? I eventually made attempts to leave but for 2 hours she was trying to get me to stay and hear her out. She said she doesn't want to loose the opportunity of loosing what we could have potentially been together. Today (Monday 27th she sends me a long text message but I haven't responded).

1oi2laj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oi2laj,first time kong lumipad internationally on a business class seat,"I was lucky enough to be able to fly starting at a young age but this is the first time that I flew out of the country in a business class seat for a work-related trip. It was a Qatar Airways flight from Manila to Athens with a 5-hour layover in Doha. As someone who has flown economy all my life, the experience was an eye-opening experience to say the least. I don't really have any complaints in flying economy, but those who have taken long-haul flights can agree that it's not the most pleasant experience. Not so in business class. Gone are the uncomfortable seats, middling in-flight meals, and crowded atmosphere. Instead, you have cocooned in your own spacious area, lie-flat seats make for a better sleeping experience, and the meal selection is excellent. Even PH immigration is a breeze, with a dedicated counter specifically for business class passengers.

Sobrang nakakabusog yung pagkain. We had a 4-course meal for dinner. I had the selection of breads, Arabic Mezze, Lamb Biryani, and a milky flan for dessert. Breakfast was a lighter fare with a bread basket, an omellete, and beef sausages, all washed down with coffee.

over the course of the flight, I also had several hot chocolate drinks which I suspected were made from Cadbury based on the taste, as well as a couple of drams of Woodford Reserve bourbon.

The screen was huge and the selection of movies was decent but since it was an evening flight, I opted to jst get some shuteye. It's something else to go to the restroom to freshen up and then return to your seat to see it laid out in it's lie-flat position with a thick blanket and a pillow waiting for you. Speaking of freshening up, Qatar Airways' amenity kit included Dyptique moisturizing lotions, lip balm, and a travel atomizer of Philosykos Eu de Parfum, a fitting fragrance considering my destination. There as also a pair of socks, a padded sleep mask, and even memory foam earplugs to drown out the cabin noise.

Would I do it again? in a heartbeat. Pero at triple the cost of economy, I can only justify paying the premium if it was a long-haul flight, like a trip to Europe or USA/Canada and you need to be somewhat fresh upon arrival at your destination such as a meeting or a conference. Otherwise, I'd fly economy and rest on the first day at my destination.",16,1761634611.0,FirstTimeKo,0,0.94,False

This city really left an impression and since I lurked for so long when planning our 3-day girls trip this past weekend (Type A Itinerary Planner here üëãüèº), I thought I'd pay it forward by sharing my experience. I'll have a TLDR at the end, lol.

FRIDAY

There was beautiful weather so we started the day exploring the French Quarter. We had coffee at French Truck Coffee, beignets at Cafe Beignet (mid but not bad), backtracked to grab a Pimm's Cup at the Carousel Bar (good), and visited Jackson Square.

Took an Uber to Li'l Dizzy's and wow, everything was so flavorful and exceeded my expectations, which were very high from all your reviews. We shared gumbo, fried chicken, a shrimp poboy, greens, mac and cheese, and potato salad. 10/10, across the board

We hopped the streetcar down to the French Market to grab our kids some souvenirs and had the BEST beignets of our trip at Loretta's. We tried regular as a baseline but the praline-filled? ü§åüèΩ delish. Dinner was at Luizza's by the Track. The BBQ shrimp I had was another 10/10 and everyone left full and happy. 

Spent the night on Bourbon Street. Two of us left early (not feeling it) but myself and my bestie enjoyed a wild few hours. Lafitte's was chaotic so those drinks were to-go. Gay bars are always a blast so we hopped into Oz to dance a little bit and then walked down to a few more bars that were quick visits. Last stop was The Swamp to dance again before our feet called it quits. 

Saturday

Breakfast was District Donuts and we all were happy with the chicken biscuit sandwiches and donuts. We walked around the Garden District a bit to check our some mansions but the rain ended up soaking us, despite our umbrellas. Got dry and took power naps at the hotel before dressing up in our Halloween costumes.

Saw a bit of the Krewe of Boo parade (fun!) before our 730pm tour of the St. Louis Cemetery #1. Everyone was respectful of the environment and our group asked a lot of great questions so it was super informative. Our guide was also great so I recommend this tour if you're interested. I would recommend a day tour vs an evening one, so you can see all the details better. 

We Ubered to Coop's Place for dinner and this hole in the wall was yet again, another 10 out of freaking 10! Gumbo, red beans and rice with smoked sausage, jambalaya, and etouffee were shared and cherished üòÖ. Walked over to Frenchmen Street and this was definitely more us.

Le Maison, Cafe Negril, Blue Nile, Spotted Cat, Apple Barrel, 30/90- how could such a small street have so much awesome music and vibes?! So many talented musicians, artists, and singers?! Not only did the jams heal me but the Art Bazaar was dope too. It was all so fun!! I forced them to Key's Fuel Mart for fried chicken around 230am and it was great too! I think this was my favorite fried chicken of all but my alcohol consumption likely cancels the credibility of my review. 

Sunday

A late start after a late night and 11am was a hard time to get into somewhere. We ended up just eating at a small place next to our hotel and it was good. Broke off and 2 of us went to the Audubon Zoo and 2 of us (incl me) went to the WW2 Museum. 

We both enjoyed our trips and the museum was truly a mesmerizing experience. So heavy, yet so beautifully put together. It inspires a sense of patriotism I haven't felt in a while and in these tumultuous times for our country, I think it's worth a visit if you're here. Please note it is HUGE so plan this for a full morning or afternoon (3.5h min). We only had 3 hours allotted, leading to us missing a few portions and having to power walk past a few exhibits.

The 4 of us met up again at the French Quarter and got beignets at Cafe Du Monde and Bon's (regular and bananas fosters). Cafe du Monde was a fun experience and they were good, I liked them better than Cafe Beignet and Bon's but Loretta's is my queen! üëë 

Dinner was at Neyow's Creole Cafe and it was the perfect ending to the trip. Especially the bread pudding at the end. Our flight was at 5am so that was our trip!

Every person we met was kind, we never felt unsafe, and nothing was pickpocketed. There was a post here a little while ago that said she had an awful time and I don't know how that could be. You give what you get I guess, and the Crescent City cast a spell on me. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

This sub was so helpful with recommendations and I hope this post can help with other visitors on their first trip. The amount to see and do is overwhelming but the chances of experiencing something great are pretty high. I wish this charming city and all it's lovely residents nothing but love and prosperity! üíï

1oi2jsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oi2jsa/millab_m01/,Millab M01,"TL;DR: I like shiny new things, especially when they make good espresso. Oh, and don't take me too seriously; I am simply one of many grains of sand blowing in the ever-expanding internet universe, fallen victim to trendy/viral Instagram marketing adds.

I purchased a Millab M01 hand grinder, and let me tell you: it's heavy. 1 KG of solid metal... I got mine when they were running a 25% discount for the black and wood model ($300 USD), and some initial thoughts:

1. It grinds pretty fast. I know that's somewhat subjective to how intense people spin handles, but for me, I found it much quicker than a Porlex (yes, the only other hand grinder I ever used was that baddie). Actually, I find it much quicker than my Baratza Encore I bought back in 2014... 
2. Did I mention the weight? You'll feel it in the hand that holds the body, because when the handle lightly catches, you'll feel the inertia of the object. I'm not going to say I prefer or do not prefer the weight, because I just got it today, so perhaps an update in the future will decide if I hate it or adore it as a baby step into the vast kingdom of Swole Nation.
3. It doesn't catch or jam like some other hand grinders. I saw that Millab/Timemore was marketing their Pineapple Burr as a design to increase cutting surface/emulating a flat burr or something like that, and I don't know if that's why it doesn't catch as much, or if it's because technology has grown significantly and I'm a coffee dinosaur. Or, perhaps, the weight of the object creates its own center of gravity and in reality, I'm rotating AROUND the grinder, and so the coffee is being crushed by immense gravitational pressure. Or, perhaps, I need to just stop starting sentences with prepositions, because that's bad grammar. 
4. I LOVE how the catch cup locks in place. It feels incredibly secure, and the actual physical locking mechanism is quite satisfying to use. Yes, it's just a twist-off, but in a world where magnets secure nothing when standing up against my clumsy hands, a twist-off seems like a god-tier addition.
5. It's quiet. Very quiet (more bad grammar!?). I live in a town and commute to a larger city, so I enjoy the peace and quiet. I finely calibrated my sweet, sweet baby Encore, and it takes a solid 2-3 minutes to get 16 grams of coffee ground. That's 2-3 minutes of an eternal, relentless torment for my ears, first thing in the morning, so I asked myself, why hurt my mind when I could just join Swole Naysh?
6. I know nothing about particle distribution, so don't ask me. I don't have a laser, and I don't know any claims Millab makes to be verifiable and true. What I can tell you is...
7. Espresso tastes awesome. I'm accustomed to Mahlkonig EK43, Mazzer Robur, and Nuova Simonelli Clima-whatever shots, so with a lighter-roasted coffee from Ethiopia, I expected a very particular taste: the taste of disappointment. I was pleasantly surprised. It's been a while since I had bright, light-roasted espresso that didn't taste like ""sour"", grassy, and unevenly extracted pulp. The texture was silky, the acid profile was tame, and the sweetness was pleasant and didn't vanish quickly. I did 17 g. in and \~42 g. out in 23 seconds, and I also did 17 g. in and 34 g. out in 34 seconds, and while I prefer the former, I appreciate the fruitiness of the coffee more than I thought I would. 

Some context: I am using a DeLonghi Linea Classic with an after-market bottomless portafilter, screen, shaker, and self-leveled tamper. I don't think I really need anything too fancy for home; as long as it pressurizes and steams, I'll be happy, for now. If you own one of these, don't use after-market bottomless portafilters designed for other DeLonghi models because they don't fit. Look for Casabrews portafilters; I looked up their CM5418 model to find appropriate accessories. Also, the steam wand is a pannarello, so I'm in the process of modifying it. I also use Third Wave Water Espresso Profile packets with distilled water, which has been a huge help as well. 

I'll make some more espresso and maybe do an update later; let's brew this. ",1,1761634440.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I started running jobs pre covid and maybe it has more to do with the dynamic that I was ""low man in the work flow,"" and am not anymore?  But 4 different guys I've worked with for the past 15 years (on and off throughout the years depending on jobsite size) often always start standard normal conversationa or work related responses with, ""No,"" and also all happen to be boomers.

Now, I'll try to explain and give a few examples. Its pretty minor and I've only recently noticed over the last few years and maybe I've just got reddit brain from longterm scrolling since covid. But, again as mentioned above, a lot of small talk conversation responses start with the word ""no,"" and after all these years today I had a light bulb go off and made me think: are these guys ever actually listening,  or always just waiting to get their 2 cents in and be heard? 

Conversations from earlier today. Word for word isn't perfect but will be pretty damn close

Example 1: me: ""Hey, I need you to rough in a few door openings."" 

boomer co worker: ""No. But okay, when I finish getting set up for the day I'll start on the rough opemings."" 

Me: what do you disagree with? What do you mean no?

Boomer: well no, im just saying I'll do that. 

Me: Okay, thanks.  Ill be working on the second floor so let me know when youre done and we will go for coffee after. 


Example 2 (smoke break small talk): 

Boomer: I didnt get around to insuring my bike this summer. 

Me: that sucks man. I I'm thinking of getting my bike license again, i let mine expire after (coworker) died from his motorcycle accident. Wow it's been awhile. I cant believe that happened in 2011.

Boomer: No. *pause* How many years has it been? Anyway, want to hear a piss off? in the 80s i was riding the shoulder and a lady called the police on me and I got a ticket. Bullshit I tell you, you know it's legal to ride the shoulder now? 


Now that im reading this back, yeah, they are just always half assed listening. I'm not even going to bother with anymore examples. The post is long enough as it is and look forward to hearing any similar NO stories.

For context: I worked for years in what could be called a sweatshop. It was a coffee roaster in the middle of Las Vegas, where during the height of the summer, working temperatures in our warehouse could reach 130+ degrees Fahrenheit. I began feeling faint at work and became legitimately worried for my safety. The owner for years simply refused to fix our office AC, or get cooling for the warehouse (relatively small one) claiming it‚Äôd be too expensive even when we were doing well. The only cooling we had in the office were those Everstar wall mounted things, which at the time of my complaint were failing and not properly cooling the office.

I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I was suffering and so were the people around me. I submitted an OSHA complaint end of August, fearing I was approaching heat stroke. I also began to talk with my coworkers about our pay and working conditions. We also began producing for a very well known car company which is owned by a very public facing white supremacist who is the reason USAID is being withheld from children and sick people‚Äôs in Africa. I found this morally reprehensible. For what it‚Äôs worth, so was the business, as they feared retaliation and would have us ship without anything identifying it to said car manufacturer.

For what I was being paid and how my coworkers and I were being treated, I had to stand up and do something. It wasn‚Äôt sustainable. I talked to my manager, a long time friend who had confided in me multiple times how abusive our boss was towards her and who has withheld raises from her for over 5 years, that I had made the OSHA complaint and that I wanted to talk to others about organizing for better pay/conditions. She told me she would ‚Äúforget‚Äù what I said but was going to talk to our warehouse manager, her cousin, about what we had talked about it. I was not present for that conversation and don‚Äôt know what he was told. During this conversation I also had to make clear that I physically could not work in the warehouse that week (the previous weeks I had been dancing with heat exhaustion and was heavily fatigued) for my own safety, and that I wasn‚Äôt going to work on the car manufacturer product, instead making clear i would take care of other duties during that production period.

Over the next couple of days I talked to 3 other coworkers (we were a fairly small team, so this is most of the employees I‚Äôve talked to at this point). I told them that the way we were being treated was inhumane, that I made an OSHA complaint, and that we should organize for better pay and working conditions. Everyone I talked to completely agreed with me. I was cut Thursday, and Friday morning, I walked in and was promptly ‚Äúlaid off‚Äù due to economic reasons. During this debrief, my warehouse manager began to talk about how others had responsibilities and children (referring to his cousin, my manager) and couldn‚Äôt afford to jeopardize their jobs, before my manager cut him off and returned to the company line of economic downsizing.

I filed an OSHA whistleblower complaint immediately and there‚Äôs been an open investigation for the past 2 months. In his response to my whistleblower complaint, my boss tried to frame my complaint as retaliation for being fired, but I had no idea layoffs were even on the table. He also lied and said that a previous employee was laid off a few months ago as part of this downsizing, but I know for a fact they had been fired for incompetence and wasting product. However, the OSHA investigator got in contact with this previous employee, and they said that they were told they were laid off for downsizing. Which means my employer lied to them about why they were fired, but the only proof I have are text messages to my partner on the day of this person‚Äôs firing explaining the situation. Nothing directly from management. The investigator seemed close to closing the investigation and generating a report, but after talking with him said he‚Äôs going to keep the case open while he checks with his lead investigator. I‚Äôve told him and provided him with as much as I can. He also told me that they received notice of my safety complaint after they laid me off, and have sent him contracts they‚Äôve lost over the past couple months as proof that the business is suffering.

(As for my boss‚Äô response to my initial safety complaint, he also lied in his report, and all the equipment he listed as sufficient for cooling was the same equipment that existed when I first made the complaint. His response seems to imply this equipment was implemented in response to my safety complaint. As far as I know this investigation is also still ongoing.)

At this point, I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt regret what I did, but it‚Äôs financially crippled me and my wonderful partner has been the only thing keeping me afloat. I also worked primarily with people I‚Äôve known since high school, but since my termination all of them have dropped contact with me save for one. I‚Äôm emotionally devastated and confused. I‚Äôve managed to find a part-time job at least, but it‚Äôs a pay cut for sure. No lawyers have been interested in the case (except one, but only if OSHA rules in my favor), and I can‚Äôt afford to straight up hire one. I still think that my firing was fishy, though it may not be related to my OSHA complaint and now I‚Äôm more convinced it‚Äôs because 
I was trying to organize. 

My question is: What are my options? Should I be talking to the NLRB? And any other general advice?

TL;DR I began discussing my OSHA complaint and organizing at work, and was fired all in the same week it happened. There‚Äôs an active OSHA investigation, but at this point I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm even talking to the right agency. What are my options, and any advice for situations like these?

My friend deliberately introduced us because he knew I was a social butterfly and he was a little bit shy. But we instantly clicked, we spent the whole night together talking. After the party, we were heading to my house, and on the way I stopped and told him: ‚ÄúTo be honest, I haven‚Äôt done anything like this for over a year. I don‚Äôt mean this to sound like anything big, but I want something more than just a one-night stand. Today is fine but in general I am not up for continuing that kind of communication with anyone‚Äù (tbh we were both really drunk so the sentence might be a little bit more cringe)

We spent the night talking and only moved a little bit forward. The next morning, I had to wake up very early, so he got up with me, we hugged, and parted ways. He didn‚Äôt text me that day, but the following afternoon he did. He was texting every 4‚Äì5 hours, but with long questions and answers.

On the third day, still very bad at texting (average answer time 6-7 hours) he asked if I was free tomorrow. I told him it would have been better if it was today or the day after tomorrow, which sparked the question: ‚ÄúWhy not meet tonight?‚Äù Keep in mind, it was already 10 pm. We ended up meeting around midnight, drank some beer, ate street food, and then went to my place. We talked until 5 in the morning and didn‚Äôt do anything physical ‚Äî we just hugged and slept. In the morning, we had sex, which was very short, and he mumbled that it had been a while since he‚Äôd had anything going on. It was totally fine with me. We sat and talked until 3 pm and made plans for the weekend.

On Saturday, we met, ate, drank, and talked for hours. We went back to my place, and he said, ‚ÄúTomorrow we should go to X restaurant and you should stay at my place.‚Äù That night we had a lot of fun but he still thought it was short and kind of shy about it, I reassured him it was alright. In the morning, I made coffee; he woke up but left more quickly than last time, though he had mentioned errands the day before with his dad whom he don‚Äôt really like. He didn‚Äôt text me for 3‚Äì4 hours, so I reached out to see if we were doing anything. He said his errands took longer than expected, and if we met right then, we wouldn‚Äôt have time for the restaurant, but we should do it in a couple of days. I said okay.

We texted once more, but then he didn‚Äôt message me for 22 hours. Eventually, he said work was crazy and very chaotic, and he was very tired. I asked what happened and how he was, but even after 12 hours, I still don‚Äôt have an answer.

I don‚Äôt understand him. His character is very soft and fragile but also aware and watchful. He keeps mentioning that he‚Äôs never good with his phone, he even asked me to check his screen time for him, which was only 2 hours and 50 minutes, not a lot. He lives in his head a lot and drinks a lot because he tries to be a chill person. He had a gastric sleeve surgery 1 year ago because of the weight he gained from drinking. I had the same surgery few years ago too so we bonded over that as well.

I‚Äôve been maintaining a free and open-source boilerplate for Kotlin + Compose Multiplatform to help devs build apps in days instead of weeks.  
just pushed version 0.3.0 and it comes with a bunch of new stuff and improvements:

- MultiModule Architecture ‚Äì easily plug in modules like analytics, notifications, UI components, etc.  
- MixPanel ‚Äì added event-based analytics for Android and iOS (since MixPanel doesn‚Äôt have a KMP lib yet, this setup should help)  
- Notifications ‚Äì integrated with Alarmee for simple scheduling  
- and a bunch of other things like UI layouts, components, Room DB setup, utils, helpers, koin DI, Cocoapods setup for Kotlin so you can use Objective-C libraries directly in Kotlin, and SwiftKlib Gradle plugin support that lets you use native Swift code right inside your Kotlin projects  

it‚Äôs open-source, free to fork, and hopefully useful if you‚Äôre starting a new multiplatform project.

Started training again a year back and did train properly for 2 months and due to muscle memory gained decently but again everything halted due to the the consequences of earlier trauma. 

Now decided to rejoin and took the membership. Earlier trained with Mike Mentzer's heavy duty program(from July 2023 - Nov 2023) and did actually saw great results in spite of me being inconsistent with diet and rest. Would like to go for the same but I have been told to make my body adapt first for 2-3 months.

Life has a quirky way of changing in front of you, sometimes for the better, sometimes the worse. You have so little control over so many things that it leaves a constant and pressing feeling in the hearts of everyone at some point in their life. It‚Äôs toxic yet also intoxicating. It can be the force that drives you to self-destruct, or break and go mad. It could even drive you to run. And perhaps then, as you run, an ornate grand wooden door swings wildly open in front of you. Suddenly! A hand the size of a bear‚Äôs claw, with the strength to match, grabs you and pulls you inside.
You are faced down a hall that seemingly never ends. You look around, only to notice that the grizzly hand and the door it pulled you through are no longer there.
Now here you stand, totally and utterly alone with no way back. As you stand in the humming silence of the dimly lit hall, in the distance you notice a red hue. You begin to head ever so slowly toward the faint light, your left hand gently brushing the lightly textured pattern on the wall. It helps you, gives you something physical to hold onto. It makes each small step closer to that crimson glare a little easier.
With each breath and step made farther down the hall, the silent hum from the entrance ever so slowly turns into a faint murmur, an inaudible whisper. You stop for a moment, digging your nails into the plaster as if to mark the rest point. You lean in, ear toward the hum, trying to hear the whispers a little more clearly. You close your eyes and listen to the whispers. You hold your breath to drown out the sound of your own breathing. You open your eyes; the brief added darkness lets the soft red brighten ever so slightly. You can almost see, almost, only just if you look right. What seem to be curtains? The hum, as you lean in, sounds like the soft whipping flutter of light fabric caught in the soft airstream of a ceiling fan. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I move once more toward it. I breathe, in and out. I blink.


Coffee?

A bright light shining in through the windows peeks and catches you in a blink, almost blinding you. Was that all a dream? As you shake off the sleep and try to escape from the comfort of your king-sized bed and organic silk sheets, you peer over your shoulder to see the digital clock say 9:08 AM. My eyes go wide, body leaping out of bed. You rush over to the blinds and open them. ‚ÄúI need to take a shower; I need to get ready for work.‚Äù
I hear myself say the words, but I don‚Äôt recall thinking them. I shake off the feeling and quickly run to the bathroom to take a fast shower. I try to halt my feet‚ÄîI wanted to look at that flower in the tree‚Äîbut instead, I get dressed rapidly and look at the clock again: 9:28 AM. ‚ÄúExcellent, I‚Äôve got time for breakfast.‚Äù I do feel hungry, but did I think those words, or did they just come? I feel uneasy. ‚ÄúShake it off; we‚Äôve got this! We need some coffee now.‚Äù I‚Äôm right; we‚Äôve got this. I walk down the hall toward the banister, looking out past a large chandelier of bronze and crystal shining a spectrum of colors. Pictures of my partner and our family‚Äîa little girl standing between my wife and me, our parents and siblings, our nieces and nephews‚Äîline the wall, a pictorial history of my life from college to today.
Looking at the pictures, in my body, I know them; they are normal. This is life. But why is there an eating feeling, like something impossible and important is being missed or forgotten? Am I going insane? ‚ÄúNo, I just need coffee.‚Äù I‚Äôm right; yeah, I just need coffee. Going downstairs toward a grand open kitchen covered in marble and redwood, everything seems to gleam and shine like a room made of pearls and diamonds, but again, coffee has yet to be had. I sluggishly creep to my beloved K-Cup coffee machine, quickly managing to bring myself somewhat to life with the strongest coffee and tallest setting I can set. After a few sips, I feel a little bet‚Äî‚ÄúWow, this Max caffeine from Maxwell House really hits the spot. I‚Äôm ready to take on the day!‚Äù ‚Ä¶tee, and I‚Ä¶ what the fuck was that! Shout! Scream! I think as commandingly and loudly as possible.
‚ÄúI think I might need some of the decaf for work.‚Äù
What the fuck is happening!? is all I can think as I try to will my body to do what I want, but I can only watch helplessly as my body moves through the front door. As I pass through to the outside, this shallow surface rips, a fissure in the center like torn paper. Into the deep black, I trip down.


Marks.

I catch myself. I open my eyes; around me is only complete darkness once more. A musky noir permeates the air, heavy and still as I stand and feel around. I can feel that I‚Äôm next to a wall. I run my hands up and down the cool, lightly textured wall, noticing an ever-so-slightly deeper indent with my left index finger. I move my right middle finger to the indent and feel that the nail matches it like a missing puzzle piece. I‚Äôm in the hall again, but this time with no faint glows or hidden whispers. No, this time I‚Äôm left to feel around in an eerie, placid abandon.
I hold on to the wall with my left hand and reach out with the right. I move and stretch out until I‚Äôm able to hold my palms on both walls at the same time. I can at least guide myself up and down. I can leave marks to note if I‚Äôm backtracking.
The absolute silence leaves an unnatural feeling in your mind; you hear all of you: every pulse, every breath, every gurgle and pop. Silence isn‚Äôt peace; it‚Äôs a reminder of how truly loud we all are. I can almost hear every crack and sparking fire of each nerve ending and brain cell with each movement and every thought.
‚ÄúFocus on moving, just focus on one foot in front of the other.‚Äù I have to motivate myself past the unnerving feeling of hearing the blood move in my veins and arteries. ‚ÄúJust step and slide!‚Äù I narrate my actions to myself with each new step and proceed forward, leaving a new indentation every five steps exactly.
Hours blur as I scratch mark after mark, each nick a futile plea for progress. Tedious, but at least it‚Äôs something to cling to.
As I feel for a spot to indent, I notice a line deeper than the other normal, textural grooves of the wall. I feel over it, back and forth. They‚Äôre all my indentations, each one from the beginning, hours ago. I run the length of the hall for as long as I can, my fingers flinging over the seemingly never-ending string of marks cut into the wall by my own hand, over and over, and over again and again. I run, and in my panic, I forget the simplest and most instinctual thing. I forget to breathe.
My heart beats at the pace of a drum roll. A shrill, piercing whistle cuts the noisy silence. I feel a warm liquid run from my nose, and I can feel myself in the throes of passing out. I stumble and find myself acquainted with the floor, almost drunkenly; we embrace like long-lost friends.
My head and chest are the first to contact. Maybe that‚Äôs why I see sparks of blue and white fill the darkness, like fireflies. The sound of my heartbeat and blood rushing fills my ears, a ringing‚Äîsharp, piercing, personal. My breaths shallower, heavier, I feel my hands shake, my pulse in my fingertips, a trickle of thick wet from my nose. I lie and fade into darkness, helpless, alone. I think one thought, not happy or sad, really, just curious: Will I dream?

Experience.


Everyone always hears about how when you die, your life will flash before your eyes. What they don‚Äôt tell you is that it‚Äôs like every event of your life is a movie, and they are all playing on the same projector in an overlapped mess.
I see my birth play out in all its messy glory, layered with my wedding, all my birthdays, and the births of my children, all at the same time. It‚Äôs impossible to keep straight. More than that, it all seems to play in reverse with a shrill sound on repeat, reminiscent of a skipping record and nails on a chalkboard. I want to cover my ears and turn away.
My eyelids feel stapled, my neck rigid. I am forced to watch this dilapidated recounting of my subpar life‚Äîmy mediocre birth and numb indifference to life played out before me on repeat. My hell deserved?
My sins, so benign yet so plentiful, that I should sit in judgment of myself with no witness to bear my testimony. No demons or mongrels to rip me apart or feast on my remains for eternity. Rather, I sit in silence and lament what should be said of a life wasted.
No, this can‚Äôt be my life unfolding or my hell eternal. No, this is my fear and panic.
I need to wake up. I must wake up.
Rip, tear, fight, FUCK! No! I can, I must!!
WAKE UP!!!

Break.


I gasp, my eyes opening to nothing. The musk from before is heavier, vaguely ammoniated and metallic, almost coppery. My mouth, acidic, dry, salty. The taste of blood and sickness causes me to cough and spit. My head, heavy, the ringing dull, fading in my ears. I come to in a puddle under and around me, of my personal messy design. Still pitch black but now cold, wet, and smelling of puke and piss. I wipe my face as best I can.
I slowly pull myself upright and feel the wetness squish with each small motion. As I sit, disgusted with myself for this whole new line of issues, I decide to get naked because it‚Äôs dark and I‚Äôm alone, which doesn‚Äôt need to be made worse by walking around in clothes I‚Äôm inevitably going to burn when I get out of here. The air is still and stagnant, and cold, only just cold.
‚ÄúI AM ALIVE!‚Äù I exclaim.
You‚Äôve no need to bleed or feel cold when you die. And I passed out, had a bloody nose, and a piercing headache. Alone, bothered, confused, and stark naked‚Äîall of these things I am, but also alive! I decide to myself.
The notion of not being dead overtakes me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm alive.‚Äù I sink and swell to tears, finally a rest from the dread that permeates waking life. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever been so happy to know this fact, one I‚Äôve often taken for granted without thought of the alternative.
Then a heaviness fills me. Yes, I am alive, but if I‚Äôm alive, then where am I? Who has done this to me? Why have they done this? What‚Äôs the point? My mind becomes crowded with questions I scream into the darkness.
Naked and afraid, I crawl to the opposite side of where I passed out to contemplate my next moves.
I sit in silence and wonder how to escape in a room where my most reliable sense is made obsolete. I decide to try and walk again, figuring the motion might help release some of the tension building in my shoulders and back. I stand up and stretch out as much as I can, standing on the tips of my toes to not let a single tendon remain unextended. I begin to walk, opposite the direction from before, I think, somewhat hoping the door I was pulled through would magically reappear.
‚ÄúWhat is this!‚Äù I say loudly, as if the darkness would respond, granting me some password to release me from this nightmare. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in a room that goes in a loop but never corners? This is a dream? Hell? Right?‚Äù I say aloud again, hoping for a response from the nothing. The silence lingers; the hint of an echo whispers back. I scream and curse nonsense in vain hope of release.
I frantically hug the wall nearest to me, running my hand over every square inch of wall I can in hopes of feeling a button, a release, or a hidden door. I pace each side up and down for an eternity, feeling around in the dark.
‚ÄúNothing!‚Äù No lever or button, no push door or mirror. Just a never-ending line of repeating, lightly textured plaster over what I assume is wood or particle board? I knock on the wall heavily. ‚ÄúYeah, particle board.‚Äù I answer my own question, tired of no response back. My fingers deftly brush a seam in the wall‚Äîa door? Moving my hands over a small space, back and forth, for a knob, another seam. No, just more plaster.
Frustrated, I begin to slump down, sliding my bare back down the cool, lightly textured wall. I‚Äôm so tired now, and hungry, and thirsty.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve been here, but it‚Äôs been too long!‚Äù I speak to myself, finding comfort in the echo of my words, like another voice speaking in solitude. Excruciating pain in my stomach forces me to grip it and retch in agony. It‚Äôs more than just hunger; it‚Äôs dehydration, it is madness. The pain begins to subside. I blink; I begin to see, I think, light?
A weak but present light, only when I blink. I hold one eye closed and see the light. It‚Äôs not in this godforsaken hall. The light is in my eye. I focus on it and close my eyes, cover them, and press in lightly; a cascade of shapes fills the light, enhancing it. I feel myself get lost in it.


Famish.

I‚Äôm consumed with light, surrounding and beaming me away from the dark hall. As I open my eyes and lower my hands, before me is a great table draped and covered in white linens and lace, carefully choreographed with carafes of wine and water, with chafing dishes covered but billowing with steam that lightly falls from the tableware, as if to wave me over, enticing me to greedily clear the whole table.
Around me, the setting of a pasture clearing with oak and cedar and willows spread across the distance, tall, thick grass tickles the spaces in my toes as I take each step closer to the table. The sun sits low in the sky, giving the scene a romantic melancholy from behind the long, branching curtain of the closest willow.
Approaching the table, soft jazz begins to play around me. I remove the lids to the dishes: a scene of perfectly roasted chicken with skin crackling and golden brown atop a bed of glazed carrots and pearl onions, permeating with the smells of thyme, sage, and lemon. Below, another dish holds a slow-braised beef shank sitting in a pool of rich demi-glace, paired with roasted fingerlings and vibrant wax beans, and a carafe each of icy water and rich, aromatic wine to wash it all down.
As I eat, the scene of romance quickly becomes a gruesome horror. With every bite, I feel my hunger deepen. A consuming drive to eat all before me becomes a mission, a need. My lungs do not want air; my only desire is to consume all I see, ripping flesh from bone like a ravenous wolf.
The sounds of my gluttony drive me more, but with each bite, a scream, ever-present and louder, grows around me. Mindlessly, I lift a handful of chicken and bite down. The screams grow louder, more directed. With each bite, each chew, the screams overtake me. It clicks in me, and I can‚Äôt care; my hunger won‚Äôt allow me to. The food is screaming and crying to not be eaten, but I can‚Äôt stop. The chicken, whispering pleas of my name to spare the rest: ‚ÄúWas the breast and leg not enough?‚Äù it bleats.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my mind; it isn‚Äôt real,‚Äù I tell myself, unsure if it‚Äôs a lie or the truth. My heart weighs heavy with guilt as I lift a carrot, hoping the screams will subside. Please, don‚Äôt do this! We are alive! I hear one glazed baby carrot feebly say just before being chewed.
The water stays untouched, silent, but present. I can feel it watch my slaughter, judging, seething in its hate for being the only witness to the genocide of its family. I stare at it with each new bite and chew. The guilt quickly becomes malice and intolerance for the judgment of this odd life. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault I‚Äôm hungry; I needed to eat.‚Äù
The water does not respond.
‚ÄúSit there in silence, then! You didn‚Äôt beg me to stop or wish for it to be over, did you?‚Äù
The water does not respond.
SPEAK!!
The water does not respond.
Upon this final display of intolerance, I grab the carafe and pour the water on the grass at my feet. But still, the water does not respond.
With the table clear, the twilight lighting of this fairy-tale forest turns to night; the wind blows cold, and the trees wither and die. Dark, ominous clouds cover all but a sliver of light. The sharp crack burns through me, a clap and roar sound, and I am engulfed in shadow and fog, thickening like hot black oil, sludge, butt-matted, void of sheen. It fills my lungs, my sinuses; it‚Äôs so cold but burns my eyes. It swallows me. I sink, deeper, and suffocate. I feel my chest convulsing. I sink, I fall.


Rage.

I ooze slowly, then fall to a soft plop, like being shit out or born again from an asshole. I hack out the disgusting sludge, wipe my eyes as I gasp and cough, shaking the heavy air with every outburst, only to have it echoed back, almost mockingly. Lightly tapping the wall with my knuckles as I reach back, cracking and creaking my bones back to my desired level of comfort, most days.
As I regain my normal posture, I realize I feel full. My hunger and thirst, ravenous before, now feel satiated, stifled by the feast that appeared in my mind.
I can still taste the wine and meat with every breath. ‚ÄúHow!?‚Äù I cry into nothing. I begin to run down the hall, desperately trying to make sense of this nonsense place. With every seventh step, I feel the puddle I left from my panic before. With each crossing, a splash and squeak.
Though alone, each crossing brings me shame and disgust, coupled now with the perplexing guilt of feasting on sentient food that existed in my mind. With each crossing, a splash and squeak.
Though void of reason or physics, each crossing intensifies the feelings of loathing I bear upon myself. I question my reality, testing my sanity, testing my patience. With each crossing, a splash and a squeak.
Without sense, and within madness, I run, perpetually dripping sweat from every pore of my naked body, only increasing the noise of every pass, deepening my guilt and shame, but at least it is a sound outside of my own voice, a dreadful yet reliable racket. With each crossing, a splash and a squeak.
Upon this last crossing, the puddle, now pooled with a mix of visceral fluids, makes that fastidious, tingly noise as I step into it. I slip and fall, my head lying now within this pool of disgust and petulance.
‚ÄúMurderer‚Ä¶‚Äù
I faintly hear a whisper, not like before, yet somehow familiar, all the same unsettling. I shoot up, curious about the source of this new inhabitant that has entered my endless hall.
‚ÄúWho is that? Who‚Äôs there?‚Äù
As quickly as the words leave my lips, all remnants of the whisper are gone. Clearly, some joke my unconscious is playing on my subconscious, trying to convince it I‚Äôm conscious. Disappointed, I lie back down, forgetting the puddle of‚Ä¶ of ick.
‚ÄúYeah, I deserve this,‚Äù I say to myself, resigned to this purgatory.
‚ÄúYou deserve death, murderer‚Ä¶‚Äù it whispers.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not real! You‚Äôre in my head. Leave me alone.‚Äù
‚ÄúI am as real as you, as real as the family you slaughtered before me in our pasture. You did not leave them‚Äînot one morsel, and hardly a bone. You drank my sister as you glared at me, unable to hear my screams and pleas. And when my time had come, I, ready to welcome my fate, was spared and poured at your feet into the ground‚Ä¶‚Äù it whispers.
‚ÄúNo!? How are you here with me? How is this possible?‚Äù I question through tears and fears of loathing and hate for my accuser and myself.
‚ÄúYou ran. I fell through the ground, through your mind, bone, flesh, and skin. I fell through you to hold you to your guilt and to hold you in place‚Ä¶‚Äù it whispers.
With that, the whisper becomes a banshee‚Äôs scream, and I can feel the liquid quickly cool and freeze to my hair and head, gluing me to the floor, unable to even move. I scream and shout and try to twist, but with every tremor, the ice hardens and cools, tighter and deeper, like a brain freeze but only in the back of your mind.
‚ÄúNo! No! I already have nothing here‚Äîno light, no clothes, and nobody else. I will not give away my‚Ä¶ my anything else!‚Äù I shout, trying to leverage back and punch the puddle of ice.
Nothing works for several hours until, in my desperation, in my stubbornness, I refuse to lie here in perpetual nothingness. I try one last thing, one last option that may kill me, but at this point, I‚Äôd welcome a death, but only on my terms. Those in no way include being murdered by sentient-sweat-water-ick seeking revenge!
I pull, trying to lift out of the ice. I pull hard, scrunching my body tight, trying to add more leverage with every yank, slowly and agonizingly yanking harder and harder.
The sound of hair ripping away is tolerable; the pain, though unpleasant, is all but a warm-up.
The sound of fresh skin tearing is faint‚Ä¶ soft. The tissue absorbs most of the sound before it vibrates outward. But as I pull harder and harder, I can hear each of my nerve endings snap like tension wire. I hear a soft gushing and feel a warm, viscous liquid deep down my neck and back. The faint smell of copper and musk begins to fill the air as blood slowly pools, warming the ice to release my head a little more, enough to add just the right amount of leverage to cut away the last inch of skin holding me to my prison. As I sit up, I feel faint and dizzy. I can‚Äôt see how much blood I‚Äôve lost, but I can feel it now by my legs. I decide to stand.
I lean on the wall to pick myself up, slowly inching myself to standing, wobbly but standing. I try to take a few steps forward, unable to keep any motion straight or even predictable. As I take a third step forward, I feel myself falling and compensate by moving my fourth, fifth, and sixth steps all at once. I crash through the particle board wall, head first.
Falling‚Ä¶ no‚Ä¶ so much more. I am escaping‚Ä¶ I feel warm, no, numb. I feel like I‚Äôm spinning, no, rolling. So free.


Truth.

Tumbling through the noir chasm, the farther I go, the less real it feels. The black becomes speckled. The speckles become brighter and dance a starlight‚Äôs waltz. As I shift in posturing, I see orbs of my blood falling together next to me. I watch these dancing vermilion spheres as they fade in and out; they break and form again and again and again, never quite the same as before, yet not really any different.
I posture to face away and am encased in a sanguine cocoon. The stars dance and observe me as I‚Äôm tumbling down the void, slowly drenching me and encasing all but my eyes.
My eyes are allowed to see, and oh, the wonders they witness! The stars before me rapidly approach as I sit still in time. My body gone! All that is left is the mind and eyes in stillness as I watch the universe rapidly age and decay. Through the decay, a new horizon, bright and loud, flashes in an instant. It looks like a sunrise; it encircles the horizon without making a sound: in an instant, around me and within me. Unfazed, I remain still and motionless in time. I see the universe again retreating away, the cosmos rewinding time and space in reverse. All is opposed from before; it becomes a point of infinity inversely set. Then, once again, bright and loud without making a sound, it blankets everything as the cosmos exhales. Time moves now forward, then inhales and retreats in reverse, again, and again, and again.
I look around at the stars and sky‚Äîdead, alive, neither, both. And I close my eyes, at peace at last. Beauty, no pain. No agony. Just clarity, awareness. Presence.
Bliss, yes, that‚Äôs the word. Bliss‚Ä¶


Lies.

The loud and jarring buzz of an alarm clock. I feel my feet and shoulders flinch defensively. As I peer from under my pillow, I look at the time on the digital clock: 7:00 AM. I uncover my face and stare at the ceiling, trying to remember what I dreamt. But as soon as I think I have it, it‚Äôs gone, like I had something but lost it. I think it was pretty‚Ä¶ A knock on the door catches my attention. ‚ÄúWhat!? Yeah!?‚Äù A woman‚Äôs voice answers from the other side of the door. ‚ÄúSweetie, are you up yet? You don‚Äôt want to be late. Better start getting ready!‚Äù
‚ÄúOkay, thanks, Mommy!‚Äù I yell as I jump out of bed and run to the bathroom to get ready, nearly pushing my mom down the stairs as I quickly turn the corner. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt run in the house, Melissa! You know that‚Äôs dangerous!‚Äù my mom says sharply with a cutting glare, her hazel eyes seeming to turn black. I feel a chill in my spine every time I see those warm eyes turn cold. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry,‚Äù I respond meekly.
I enter the bathroom and step up to see myself in the mirror. I smile at the reflection of a 7-year-old with short brown hair, hazel eyes, and teeth that need a good brushing. I lean closer to look at them more closely while feeling for the faucet. As I turn the water, I think I hear a faint whisper, but I can‚Äôt make it out. Daddy says it‚Äôs just the pipes begging to get fixed. I think it‚Äôs a monster trying to get out.
I run my toothbrush under the faucet, apply a dot of strawberry toothpaste, and brush my teeth‚Äîup and down, side to side, and all around. I make a little tune in my head and look around my reflection. In the back, near my room, it looks like there‚Äôs a faint red light‚Äîno, not a light, maybe a hue in the dark.
I shake it off. I spit, I rinse, I wipe my mouth.
I blink..
