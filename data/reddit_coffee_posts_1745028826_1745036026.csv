I usually drink coffee and work in Brooklyn (Osaka) every weekend. I don’t know much about her—only that she often sits there drawing, and I’ve found myself quietly admiring her beauty.  
I’ve seen her there twice now, and something about her has stayed with me.  
If anyone happens to know who she is, please introduce us. I’d really like to get to know her—maybe it’s just a passing crush, but I can’t stop thinking about her.  
It reminds me of the film [Before Sunrise](https://tubifree.com/detail/6702276f97abf71bfff40fe8) (1995) — expecting nothing, and regretting nothing. Just the chance to meet someone... I think that's something truly beautiful.

1k2ntix,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1k2ntix/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_go_home/,AITAH for not wanting to go home?,"Hello again, Reddit. If you’ve seen any of my previous posts, you know I write these things in a sort of emotional and ramble way. And this will be no different. 

I (17f) am staying with an aunt and uncle out of state (10+ hour drive home) for the next two weeks. And I have already been here for 3 days. 

I’d love to go in detail as to why I am so reluctant to go home, but I’ve always had Reddit delete one draft of this post on accident. And I don’t want to have to type that all out again. So I’m going to keep my rant short.

I have gained weight since the beginning of the new school year. Not out of any conscious decision, but no one can stay the same weight they were at 14 forever. I’ve gained (roughly) 15 pounds. 
Even previous to me gaining weight, I was heavy set. Not out of any personal non-effort to stay thin or any conscious decision to gain weight. But I had a change in habit. I no longer took strength and conditioning in school, since I had completed my PE credit. And I started (willingly) eating more than one meal a day. Even going as far as to cut down my coffee intake.

The only reason I mention all of this, is it seems to me my mother’s primary concern for the past 2+ months. She has offered to take me to the gym with her, to which I have accepted. Even going as far as to make us a workout plan. Only for her to not take me when she goes, and not want to go on the alternative times I present that (should) work for both of us. 

On top of trying to get me back into working out (if you can call what she does that. She has a different definition of exercise than me). She has been pressuring me to start taking the same weight loss drug she takes. Even going as far as to spend a majority of the evening I was getting my graduation pictures done chatting with the photographer (who is on a similar drug) about how happy they both are with how much weight they’ve lost in two months (I’ve checked, the amounts are not healthy or sustainable). 

Understandably, I was uncomfortable. But just because of the drug talk, but because the things they said they were happy were gone were all things I either value in my appearance (wide hips and big chest) or things I enjoyed (food. I like cooking and eating GOOD food.) 

If you’ve gotten to here, you’re still reading, and you’re wondering if my mother’s concern for my weight is motivated by concern for my health? you are wrong. I have been medically cleared as healthy. No high blood pressure, no chemical imbalances, my diet is still healthy, I indulge myself occasionally, but not to an insane amount. The only issue to her is that I’m chubbier, and cannot fit into the hand me downs I’ve had for 3+ years anymore. (I grew even after I turned 14, shocker) 

to give you, the reader. A mental image of my physical appearance- and I know this sounds conceited. Please bear with me. 
I have had people I know (primarily friends in school) compare my figure to ones depicted in paintings. (I’ve image searched some of the pictures they showed me, and traced a few back to the same artist. John William Godward. So if you need a mental image- google that guy) 

Now, all that jazz about my weight might not be a very good explanation as to why I don’t want to go home after my trip ends. But that’s legitimately the tip of the iceberg, it’s just the part I went into most detail on. 

I have a primary responsibility when it comes to helping my siblings (14m, 11m, 10f respectively). Getting them from school, making them dinners, being their emotional support (if they go to my mom she makes it about her own childhood trauma. And blames my siblings for their issues), I also have to hide them during fights, take them out whenever they ask my parents and they don’t want to drive, etc.

On top of those, I am also paying more than half of my income monthly to my parents for my phone and my car insurance. 
I’m eligible to graduate early, and somehow all planning for both of my graduation parties (one for each side of the family has fallen onto me. From contacting a photographer for my pictures to figuring out times dates themes menu’s decor etc for the parties, and more. 

All of that, happens over top of me trying to finish school from home. And all of a sudden.. I’m somewhere else.

I have been away from home for three days, and I can’t even begin to describe how weird it feels to be so.. calm. I’ve been working out (they have a weight cage here), eating healthy, talking to my friends more, participating in self care, just a million and one things that were out of reach back home. 
I haven’t even has the DESIRE to eat takeout, or check my weight since coming. 
Everything is just so much calmer, and I’m having the chance to practice being a person without having kids I didn’t birth attached to the experience. 
This isn’t a vacation, I’m still expected to help out around the house and do all my schoolwork, but suddenly it feels like so much less of a burden. 

I’m still here for another two weeks or so, and I’m starting to feel abit guilty. I know I’m SO much happier here, but all of my siblings are still at home. 
I set up my Pc before i left, so that my siblings could use it to reach out in case of emergency. So I have that peace of mind. And it seems like so far nothing has happened in my absence.
But as much as I love being relaxed here, I’m worried that if I want to stay I’ll be dooming my siblings to be raised the same way I was. 

I know that I’ll still have to go home in two weeks, but I’ve been given the option to move down here once I turn 18. And I’m genuinely starting to think about it.

AITAH for not wanting to go home, at least not permanently. Even if it means I won’t be able to support my siblings as well? ",1,1745035732.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

Warning there is a hole lot of me being an idiot and my stupid love life 🤦‍♀️. So at the time I was 15F. It was freshman year of high-school and there was a guy I had a crush on for over a year. Let's call him Chad. Now Chad was a year older then me and had a girlfriend. Some real bad drama hit when they broke up and I got the tea because I wanted to know what was up with my man I found out he had gr*ped 🍇 her multiple times me being dumb I didn't believe them because, ""he's hot"" so me being me I swooped in and started comforting him and later when summer ended and the school year started he started hanging out with me all the time (coming up to me a lot in between classes) then at lunch he would show up occasionally and say hi. I had a super low esteem at the time and thought I was a worthless piece of garbage so all this attention got to my head. And when he started saying things like, ""your so pretty."" I had nearly folded.

 So fast forward me and my friends wanted to go to the local fair. He kind of invited himself and even though I had a crush on him I had a very bad feeling in my stomach that was screaming at me to run away, but like I said I am dumb. So my friends were there one of my closer friends, let's call him Jack. He was a guy I used to have a crush on he's a year younger then me. Basically he had gone to the fair with me every year previously. So I hanged out with him until Chad showed up.
When Chad did he was being really rude to my friends telling them to leave or wanting me to go off with him by myself. Of course I didn't want to I wanted to hang out with my friends. So when they decided to get on the roller coaster and I got stuck with Chad in line. That bad feeling was still there, but damn...he's hot 😭😭 so I of course I rode the roller-coaster with him. I kept making jokes like, ""I'm so scared."" Even though I've been on this thing a billion times. So of course this dumb*ss reaches his hand out offering to hold my hand (I still don't understand why this man liked me 😑) I did it because something I dreaded more then that feeling in my stomach was this moment being awkward for the next 15 seconds. So I did it. After that he became so clingy to the point he was just blatantly being an ass to my friends I sat in the bathroom and started to freak out because I was remembering what he had done (which news flash he confessed to me all that he did) I called my friend we will call her Anna and cried in there for 2 hours. When I felt it was safe I looked outside of the bathroom to see Chad looking around for me. My friend kept telling me to tell him he made me uncomfortable, but instead I chose to sit in the bathroom till he left. (If your still here I promise the story gets better, more interesting. There is some tea 🍵👀) so a week later I went to his church (personal reasons) and he was flirting with me infront of my dad 🤦‍♀️. Anyways car ride home I get a text that says ""hey, (let's call me, Emily) Emily I  have been meaning to tell you this, I really like you and I want to see if you'll be my girlfriend."" I had a feeling he was going to ask from how he was acting weird at church. But after he said that I felt nausea and fear creeping up my body. my hair rose like I was going to be killed in a back alley. ""Give me some time to think about it."" I replied. And started crying (lmao) I told my brother bc of course I did (bros before hoes) anyways basically I faked being sick and just layed in bed crying until 3 days later my friend told me. ""Just try it out if you don't like it you can just break up."" (And oh if you ever get this advice, NO! Do not. I repeat do not give them a chance if you feel off because this was actually the biggest mistake I probably have or will ever make) so I did. It wasn't all bad, he had said things like he wanted to keep our relationship from the school (which me being insecure already, and thinking that I was his next target and or his rebound this did not f*cking help!) He had sat down with me at lunch and this is when the sh*t started. He looked at me i had had some really bad sh*t happen that weekend and so i was messed up it looked like i hadnt slept in like 90+ years. He straight up put his hand on my knee it started out comforting but i was wearing a skirt and those hands were creeping up to my no, no square (many times i had specified that i wasnt ready for touch.) I slapped his hand away but he just kept going so I stood up and said ""I'm going to be late for class."" Everyone at the table was mad confused. So basically the touching hadn't stopped through out the whole time we were dating and I was getting so anxious and paranoid I hadn't felt safe to go to school. (Just wait because this is just the beginning, foreshadowing 😝) so eventually I broke up with him (over text) I was scared how he would react so I did it over text and I was mad nice. Yeah well 3 days later not only did he have a new girlfriend but he was treating me like shit. He would come up to me one more time randomly to ask two questions 1 ""will we ever be able to date again."" (Ahhhh) ""maybe."" I replied, ""I'm just not ready yet."" And 2 ""was it because my hands were to dry, I can get lotion."" He said, ""no."" I replied ""I'm just not ready. (Mf use some damn lotion, but also what a weird ass question lol) so fast forward to like 6 months later he has broken up with his girlfriend (that's a whole mess) basically she tried to 😵 herself. And he might have been the reason I never really found out why. But he did say to one of my friends that she was super toxic and used him and she had like 17 boyfriends. But let's be real... (I've also heard he touched her without consent.) Idk the full story he never explained. But jts weird around me he would speak so lovingly about her (hmm) anyways after she was sent back to her country. He started being all creepy. I was back at his church I had gotten all dressed uo because ima be fr I forgot he was there. I was wearing a mad tight dress and I really shouldn't have. Because boy could not keep his hands off. It started when apparently tech needed help so I went up to help. He was up there and was told to show me how the sound system worked. So Chad did. While doing so he was rubbing my back and saying ""good job.' And stuff like that. He also for weeks has been making non stop comments about his drivers licenses and car. Anyways he said a cringe line after I brought up me getting my license this summer. And gave me a fist bump, ""driving gang."" (Bro does not know what to do with me lol.) Anyways  later I went down to get some coffee from  cafeteria and well he said ""can I show you a secret room."" (Top 10 creepiest things NOT TO SAY!) But he grabbed my wrist and started pulling me towards a closet. (I was terrafied) as I was being pulled away i whisper in a girl's ear ""help me."" She understood the mission because the second I got pulled into that room, ""Hey Emily, have you seen the pastor I can't find him."" The girl said, ""oh yeah, I'll show you."" And I left that closet a free and untouched woman. (I dont actually know what would of happened in that closet.) Chad after that would follow me around and once when I was outside at track he pulled up in his car shouting ""hey Emily!"" But I hadn't seen his car so I waved back until the car stopped and I saw his face smiling at me. And never once have I wondered what it feels like to be hunted down by like a wolf or some shit but I had every part of my body I fight or flight mode. My hair was standing up and I was ready to run like an idiot away from that man. Mind you there is like 6th graders hanging out around me. I just started shouting kids names, ""you got this blah blah blah!"" ""Great job!"" and he drove away. I was paranoid every day. (Remember that foreshadowing it came back) he would always be watching if I didn't see it I would feel it. In a meeting for some club thing he had to be there because he always is. And I was feeling mad sick and I really didn't want to talk to this dick so when he came up behind me to talk to the teacher. I turned the other way. And so he asked, ""Emily are you okay?"" And the whole class looked at me with him practically forcing his armpit hair on Me. I was like, ""oh yeah im fine."" Anyways I went to lunch. Later that day my friend went to the office and asked me to pick up her bag that thing was heavy as shit! And so I was struggling holding my stuff and hers one of my guy friends and best moment of my life was having him come over to help and me repeating over and over, ""I can do it."" Chad was the next class in this room and when he saw it the look he gave me was pure betrayal. I was trying so hard not laugh or look at him or smile. Anways I left and he look so hurt like a guy holding my friends bag was flirting or sum. 


There is a lot of detail I didn't go into but if you have questions please ask. I am happy to yap about this story. The moral of this story is probably don't be stupid, don't date guys even if their hot and accused of bad things, don't trust a man with a pretty face who can lie aswell as he can pull girls. And lastly don't be a dumbass like me. 🙄 also I know this wasn't really a confession but if I didn't tell this whole story to someone I would have exploded so thanks random internet people. And if you some how made it through this whole thing like or put 🤏🏻 that emoji...

## Who Created Titan Quandrex?

Okay, so this part’s a bit mysterious. Like a lot of these AI-powered trading platforms, **the exact creators of Titan Quandrex haven't gone public**. No big-name CEO, no flashy team bios.

But that’s not necessarily a red flag. Even platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge operate without revealing their full teams, mostly to avoid unnecessary regulation hassles or spam. From what I could find, Titan Quandrex was reportedly developed by a group of fintech specialists, data scientists, and experienced traders who wanted to make automated trading more accessible.

It’s not uncommon in the crypto world for teams to stay behind the scenes. What matters more is how the platform performs—and so far, Titan Quandrex is gaining a lot of traction with users.

At its core, Titan Quandrex uses **AI algorithms** that scan massive amounts of market data in real-time. The system looks for trading opportunities based on patterns, historical data, and indicators. Once it spots a high-probability trade, it executes it automatically on your behalf.

Here’s how it generally works:

- You sign up and deposit funds
- The AI bot scans markets for trading signals
- When it identifies a good opportunity, it places a trade
- You monitor or tweak settings as needed

You can go fully hands-off or set your own **risk preferences and trading strategies**. It’s like setting your cruise control—only instead of driving, it’s managing your trades.

The platform also connects with brokers to execute trades. These brokers are usually regulated, but always double-check depending on your region.

## Titan Quandrex Pros and Cons

Let’s be honest—no platform is perfect. Here’s what I liked and what could be improved:

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Easy for beginners** – Simple interface, no jargon
- ✅ **AI-powered automation** – Saves time and boosts efficiency

- ✅ **Customizable settings** – Adjust risk levels, trade frequency, etc.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **$250 minimum deposit** – Not huge, but still a barrier for some
- ❌ **Limited transparency** – Creators are anonymous
- ❌ **No mobile app (yet)** – Mobile-friendly website, but a dedicated app would be nice

Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, especially if you're looking for a convenient way to dip your toes into automated trading.

Hello everyone! I’m Rats, and I’m currently returning to roleplaying ! 

I’m 26 years old (she/they) from Southern California with a full-time job, so my schedule and posting are varied. I’m huge into doing OOC content like playlist, memes or even reference photos, and I do so even when I’m unable to write replies. I prefer long term stories where we can really work and dissect characters, worlds and more! My terms are still the same; **3rd person over Discord**, I don’t do **OC x Canon or crossover content**, I do offer some original stuff stuff depending, and I ask that you be 18+ when reaching out to me.

Onto the series!

**Yellowjackets** - Lottie, Shauna, Van, Natalie, Melissa, I would love to take a swing at writing for any of them, and I prefer the pre-rescue versions, or even something prior to the crash if it’s your cup of tea.

**Overwatch** - I can pick up a variety of characters, and I love doing AU’s for this. I’m very drawn to playing Mercy, D.VA, Ana, Lucio, Baptiste, Ashe, Cassidy and potentially Widowmaker, Sombra and Sigma as well. 

**Apex Legends** - I would love to get a chance to write for Horizon, Lifeline or Wraith for this series. I had a Wattson run as well that I would love to return to, if given the chance. 

**Cobra Kai** -  Same as above, I haven’t written for anyone yet, but could try doing Miguel, Tori or Johnny to start. Maybe post series? An alt timeline where some characters didn’t get a happy ending? 

**Persona 5** - I’ve had great luck finding people to write with, but most are either on hiatus or have quietly stepped away for the time being. I love writing Akira, Ann, Yusuke and I’ve slowly began writing for Makoto.

**Invincible** - Currently caught up with the series, have not gotten to the comics just yet. I can try my hand at Mark, Eve, Cecil, Rae and potentially Rex as well. 

**Homestuck** - I’m very far behind on the newest series, but if you’d like to try something out from the old chapters, I’m really familiar with characters, and I love playing multiples at one! I would heavily prefer AU’s for this. I’m familiar with most of the gals, but I can also try a few of the guys too. 

**Wrestling/WWE** - This one is a little more complicated, as I would love to do something specially about the characters in kayfabe. Interview stuff is totally fine, but I don’t want to bring up actual names or people. I am most interested in playing Rhea Ripley across from either a Dominick or Liv.

**Resident Evil** - I love AU’s or SOL settings! Two in particular are very corny, but I would love to do a sort of “date with the presidents daughter”, with a bit of Ashley and Leon post mission being cute together, or maybe a snowy town mystery with a reunion of Billy and Rebecca. I’m pretty open when it comes to ideas. 

The miscellaneous tracks are: **Monster High**, **Kingdom Hearts**, **Disney/Dreamlight Valley style**, **School Spirits**, **The Last of Us**, **Fallout TV show**, **The Bear**, **Fullmetal Alchemist**, **DC/MCU** ( especially animated series like Creature Commandos, Harley Quinn show and the early Titans series, as well as Wandavision, and Agatha All Along) and I would love to try **SpyxFamily**, though I’m very behind on it.

I love doing stories involving **horror** and **romance** especially, however I’m not opposed to **SOL** or **mystery**. I don’t often do stories that align with canon since I heavily prefer AU’s. I have previous ideas from my older post that I would still love to adapt as well.

Specifically, I love things set in **Zombie/Fallout/Apocalypse** style worlds, **Hunger Games/Squid Games/Battle Royales** where we can dive into characters in brutal fights, **spies in a futuristic world or period pieces set in western, 50’s-90’s** and **simple Coffee shop/Bakery/Perfect street** settings where we can let characters have fun and be a little more safe. I also love stuff set in **old school Hollywood and Las Vegas.**

My last request is that you reach out to me with a general idea of what you’d like to do before moving over to Discord. I don’t open nor respond to “hey wanna write” or “let’s RP” messages, as I find them to often lead nowhere. I don’t mind returning partners, however, I don’t like being dropped randomly after a week of planning, OOC chats and excitement. Just let me know you’d like to step out and I’ll be totally content with it.

If you’re at all interested, please feel free to DM me with the word **DREAMY** so I know you’ve read through everything seen here. 

Thank you for checking out my post, and I hope to hear from some of you soon!

1k2novu,https://www.reddit.com/r/workingmoms/comments/1k2novu/spending_money_for_a_turnkey_first_birthday/,Spending money for a turnkey first birthday?,"My baby is only 8.5 months but I’m starting to think about her 1st birthday. Part of me wants to just keep it small and not really do anything, but another part of me would like to have a beautiful celebration with our close friends/family and get some pictures out of it. We didn’t really do newborn photos or any of that, so this feels like something worth documenting. She is also getting so active and wants to crawl (probably walk by 1?!) and explore everything and I would love to give her a celebration where she can just run wild and explore, rather than just hanging out at home where we constantly have to redirect her attention from dangerous places lol. 

Anyway, all that to say, I’m also busy and party planning is not an activity I enjoy. My lovely and well meaning family would probably volunteer to throw something but then I would inevitably be roped in to planning and stressing about decisions. Their house is also not baby friendly, so it would be a lot of holding baby throughout the day. 

What I’d like to do is spend way too much money outsourcing a birthday party to this very Instagram-worthy playhouse space. They would handle all the decor and would have an indoor play space that is infant and toddler friendly. They charge $1k (food and drink NOT included, but it’s a coffee house so we would just run a tab there) which is insane, but the allure of just showing up to a fully decorated and aesthetically pleasing event just sounds so appealing right now. I feel like I would just want to spend the money for the first birthday and then go smaller for the later ones, since she can be at a playground or do a pool party at the grandparents’ in the future. We have the money so it wouldn’t overextend us, I also just feel kind of silly spending this much on a 1 year old’s birthday? 

What say you, working moms? Waste of money? Worth it for the mental load? What did you wish you did/didn’t do for the first birthday?

## What is Wealth Xandorin?

Wealth Xandorin is an **AI-driven trading platform** that promises to simplify the trading process for everyday users. Think of it like your smart assistant for investing—it analyzes the markets, suggests trades, and can even automate them if you let it.

## Who Created Wealth Xandorin?

The exact team behind Wealth Xandorin isn’t super transparent, which is pretty common in this space. However, based on available data and platform behavior, it seems to follow the same blueprint as other trusted trading tools like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

From what I can tell, it was likely built by a group of fintech developers and market analysts with experience in algorithmic trading. While it's not backed by a major bank or Elon Musk (thankfully), it does seem to be maintained and updated regularly.

At its core, Wealth Xandorin uses **automated trading algorithms** combined with **real-time market analysis** to help users make more informed trading decisions. You can either let it fully automate trades or use it as a tool for manual trading.

Here’s the basic flow:
- You sign up and deposit a minimum amount.
- The platform connects you with a broker (usually regulated).
- It scans markets 24/7 and either alerts you or executes trades based on your preferences.

The AI learns from trends, so over time, it claims to get better at predicting profitable moves. Just remember, no AI is perfect—there’s still risk involved.

1k2no0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Glacialwrites/comments/1k2no0j/wp_a_burnedout_secret_agent_wizard_from_the/,[WP] A burned-out secret agent wizard from the Ministry of Arcane Affairs is forced out of retirement when an enchanted artifact goes missing from the Vault. The twist? The only witness is a sarcastic talking cat with a criminal record and a grudge against the wizard.,"**The Jade Scarab**

Weylin couldn’t decide if he liked this brand of tea. He wasn't fond of the taste, even with a touch of honey and cream. Or rather, the aftertaste. Too bitter.

He sat in his reading chair, surrounded by shelves of books and polished furniture, a cup and saucer cradled in his lap, eyes staring out at the trees that ringed his little cabin. The chirp and hum of nature sang outside his window, and a gentle breeze brought the scent of flowers bathing in the sunshine. Tranquil was the word that came to mind. Serenity.

He was at peace. Or at least, that’s what he told himself in these quiet hours of reflection.

After all, this was what people did when they retired, no? Sat around ruminating about days long past, and days yet to come. Maybe they talked about sports, the weather, or the latest social media trends, though he admittedly wasn’t entirely sure why. He sipped his tea, tapping a finger on the rim. Yes, that was the question. Why?

Boredom? Apathy?

He glanced at his mantle. The fire snapping and dancing in the hearth was an illusion, an enchantment meant to offer ambiance and the soothing crackle of flames, but no heat. A neat little spell he’d crafted back in his university days. He smiled, remembering wild nights and deep thoughts on what his younger self believed were terribly profound philosophies.

His thoughts drifted from books to birds to streaming services, and eventually settled on a sunroom he was thinking about adding to the cabin. He could sit and read in peace or pursue important research. Weylin’s current project explored the link between arcane energy and zero-point theory, a deeply unpopular premise that threatened to throw the Order into turmoil. Mundanes harnessing magic with technology? Madness.

*And here we are again*, he mused. *Come full circle.*

Back to the crux of his forced retirement and self-imposed exile to his cabin in the woods. Better that than the alternative, he supposed. Better to spend his days choking down tea and staring at a half-finished garden than to share the fate of those the Agency deemed a threat.

One of the gold bands on his right hand began to pulse gently. He froze with the teacup halfway to his lips. This was his private place, his sanctuary. No one knew he was here, and no one else was welcome.

He frowned at the ring. Enchantments cloaked his retreat from the mundane. No, someone with power had come to his place of solitude uninvited, an invader. Big mistake.

He set his teacup aside and rose, drawing on his Well of Sorcery until he trembled with power. You need three things to shape a spell: the name, the weave, and the will. Most wizards had to be taught these things. But a rare few like Weylin were born with the talent for divining weaves.

In less than a heartbeat, he’d conjured several nasty surprises for the uninvited guest, unspeakable horrors meant to rip the bones from a body and burn them to dust. Nasty bit of business, that.

He focused a hair-fine wisp of power to sharpen his senses and harden his flesh. Then he wove potent wards around himself, robust defenses meant not only to shield him from harm, but to smite any attack back upon its creator.

He stepped around the coffee table, his multi-layered robe dusting the floor, and went to meet the invader. This was his peace, his isle of refuge. How dare they come here? Power blazed within him.

*Who did the Agency send? Mynar? Braxis?*

There are two types of sorcerers, mages and wizards. Both were powerful in their own right. But unlike mages of the Lesser Path, Weylin required no focus to wield his magic. No staff, no stone, *he* was the event horizon behind his deadly spells. The heart of the storm.

With a twitch of his finger, the cabin’s door blew open, and Weylin stepped into the sunlight. He was angry at himself for not being better prepared, furious at the fools in the Agency for sending their assassins. He’d long suspected it was only a matter of time before someone with too much to lose got nervous and moved to silence him for good. He knew too many secrets. Too many names. Too many dates. That was the way these things worked. You got out… and then you got out.

Well, whoever this upstart was, they were in for a terrible day.

“Easy, Weylin,” a familiar voice cut through the roaring in his ears. Arcane energy thrashed around him in a blazing aura only another wizard could see. An awesome spectacle to give even the mightiest among them pause. “It’s me, Weylin. It’s Lande.”

The man approached in measured steps with his hands raised and empty. The forest around the cabin had gone eerily silent, and though the sky was bereft of clouds, the air held the electric tingle of a coming storm.

“Please, hear me out.”

Weylin recognized the lean, well-shaped face of a man he’d once called friend. Even a second-rate illusionist could twist a spell with enough finesse to mimic a man’s face and voice. He didn’t release the destructive forces he held. Instead, he split off another thread of power, wove a charm to dispel illusions and trickery, and hurled it at the man.

Nothing changed.

Lande stood there in his typical luxurious business attire, a handsome bit of cloth with a slight shimmer when he moved. Even his shoes dripped extravagance: soft leather loafers with a permanent polish, imported from Italy. Gold gleamed on his wrists, and jeweled rings sparkled in the sunlight. He was just how Weylin remembered him. Pompous. Arrogant. A fool.

Weylin cursed under his breath and rewove the deadly magic into a harmless beam of atmospheric energy. His arms shot upward, his head snapping back as a swirling white column blasted into the sky. For several heartbeats, it blazed into the blue, and an eerie, keening glow coalesced around him. The air stank of ozone and burnt hair. Clouds began to form above them.

When he was done, Weylin stood panting and frowning at his guest. It took far more strength to rework a woven spell than to forge one from scratch. That was the danger. Once power was called, it couldn’t be dismissed. It had to go somewhere. And if the wizard wasn’t up to the task, if he lacked the strength of will, he might very well end up as nothing more than a smoking black spot on the ground.

Many had over the years.

“What do you want, Lande?” It was all Weylin could do to keep his voice civil. “How did you find me?”

“Please,” Lande adjusted his jacket’s cuffs in a too-casual manner. “The Agency has known about your cabin since the day you set the first beam.” His eyes studied Weylin, took in the cabin and its surrounding areas, including the little half-finished vegetable garden. “Keeping yourself busy I see. Have you checked your phone?”

“Got rid of it.”

“A bit dramatic, don’t you think?” Lande’s mouth quirked. “Gone full on eccentric-old-man in your retirement, have you?”

“Don’t want it. Don’t need it.” Weylin could no longer keep the hostility from his voice. What game was Lande playing here? He felt his temper rising, the first faint spark before a raging inferno. “Get to the point of why you are here, or get lost. I’ve no time for betrayers.”

Lande nodded. The smug demeanor evaporated, but there was a hint of something in his eyes. Was it regret?

“To the point, then,” Lande said, tugging at his collar and shifting his feet. He was sweating and fidgety.

Weylin couldn’t help it, his curiosity was piqued. What was it that had Lande so nervous? No, this was beyond nervous; the man was genuinely spooked.

“There was a breach at the Vault last night,” Lande continued. “Ashlin is dead. Ghymora is grievously injured.” Weylin felt the world close in around him.

Ashlin was dead?

A shadow passed over his heart.

*No… not Ashlin.*

It was suddenly hard to see. He turned his head and wiped his eyes.

“How did this happen? Who’s responsible?” he demanded, surprised by how steady his voice sounded. He’d practically raised Ash from a boy apprentice to the fine young wizard he’d become. Anger simmered to life beneath the grief.

“We don’t know,” Lande reached into his pocket and drew out a silver envelope. He bounced the edge on his palm. “Whoever is behind the attack, is very powerful. Strong enough to defeat the Agency’s wards, the two wizards guarding the Vault, and leave no trace of their identity.”

The sky grew dark. Thunderheads gathered over the forest, and lightning flickered.

“Have you divined the area?” Weylin rubbed his eyes. All spells left traces. A skilled enchanter could divine much from such a scene. “We must hurry before it fades.”

Thunder rumbled in the distance, and a cold wind tousled Weylin’s robes.

Lande nodded, still bouncing the edge of the envelope on his palm. “Echoes of the Penumbra and sorcerous energies, according to initial reports.”

Weylin’s next words came as a whisper. “Dread Reaper.”

Thunder rumbled again.

“So it would seem.”

A few scattered drops fell around them. Lightning flared, then again.

Weylin’s mind raced. A Dread Reaper? His hair rose on end. He could count on one hand the number of wizards powerful enough to pull off such a feat, with fingers to spare. Had one of his former colleagues succumbed to the seduction of the Forbidden Path? It was unthinkable.

“You’ve been recalled to the Agency,” Lande tugged at his collar again, cleared his throat, and held the envelope out to Weylin. His hand shook, and there was a slight tremor to his voice. “Under Directive 17-B, Emergency Arcane Recall. It’s all legal. Have a read. But we must hurry. I can feel the darkness, and it’s growing stronger.”

Weylin reached for the envelope.

His name was printed in flowing script on the front. He turned the letter over and inspected the gold seal. A quick charm to check for authenticity, and he sighed.

*Of course.*

•••

Weylin inspected the jagged edge of the four-foot-thick, blackened frame where the vault’s door should have been. Agency staff scurried about the area, agents, enchanters, and diviners all scouring for clues. The murmur of their conversations made a low buzz.

He sensed the sorcerous residue left by mighty magic. It sent a prickle down his back. The attacker was indeed extremely powerful. There was no denying that. He could feel it in the warring echoes swirling around him.

“Sir.” A man in a nondescript suit with dark hair and intelligent eyes came up to Lande. He whispered something in his ear.

“Thank you, Daniel,” Lande said, and the young man moved off to attend to other duties.

“Ghymora’s dead.”

Weylin nodded. It was too much to hope she would survive her injuries, or at the very least wake long enough to help identify her killer. “You said there was a witness?”

Lande gave him a sideways glance. “Yes, but you aren’t going to like it.”

“Just out with it,” Weylin snapped. His friends were dead, the sanctity of the Vault defiled, and the tranquillity of his retirement destroyed. He had no patience left for dithering about. “Give me the name.”

“Casander.”

Weylin blinked. The criminal cat? That was their witness? Could this day become any more absurd? To the Nether with it all.

“I put that cat away for twenty years, Lande. What was he doing in the Vault when all this took place?”

“Orders from the Old Lady.” Lande shrugged and started toward the back of the Vault. “Something about mice and the oaths, I guess. Follow me.”

Once through the blasted doorway, the Vault opened into a vast, stadium-sized space, lined with shelves so tall you couldn’t see their upper reaches. Each was packed with all manner of artifacts and trinkets, statuary, scrolls, and enchanted weapons. Anything and everything.

They moved through a dark warren of shifting corridors and wandering aisles until they reached the wall: a smaller vault that housed the Agency’s most dangerous relics. A greasy, charred silhouette on the floor marked where Ashlin had made his last stand. Weylin tried not to look at it.

“Through here,” Lande said, waving an enchanted disk the size of a coin over a small metal plate etched with runes on the door. A dozen locks popped open, and they went through.

Inside, the walls were lined with artifact-laden shelves and a rune-etched marble counter spanning the rear of the vault. Resting atop the counter was a small rectangular cage holding a fat orange cat who blinked at them imperiously.

The cat stood and stretched into a vigorous arch, circled twice, and settled down to stare at them. “Weylin,” Casander said. The cat’s voice was scratchy with a broken cadence, ancient for a feline. “Heard the Agency put you out to pasture. Yet here you are. Who’s ass did you have to kiss to get your commission back?”

“Enough,” Lande leaned against one of the shelves and pretended to inspect his fingernails. “Tell Weylin what you saw.”

Casander turned his little head to look at Lande, yawned, cleaned his ears, then settled back down and closed his eyes. “No thanks,” was all the cat said.

Weylin felt irritation creeping onto his face. A few years back, he’d caught Casander selling Agency artifacts to corporations who wanted to study their arcane properties in hopes of replicating them for mass production. Fool cat.

“We don’t have time for your games, Cas,” Weylin took a step forward and frowned down into the cage. “You were caught with your paw in the hen house. You stole from the Agency. Put us all at risk with your treachery. You want to hate me, fine. But this isn't about me. It’s about Ash and Ghymora. You saw who murdered them, and stole the Jade Scarab.”

Lande reached into his suit pocket. He laid an envelope like the one he’d given Weylin on the counter beside the cage. Casander cracked one green eye and shifted his head ever so slightly to have a better look. “Better be catnip in that thing,” he said, stretching out a paw. “Ten years in a cage is a long time for anyone.”

Weylin threw up his hands and turned away.

“No catnip, I’m afraid,” Lande said. “Something much better.”

Casander lifted his head. “Better?”

“A full pardon.”

Casander blinked. He looked at Weylin, then back to Lande, and sprang to his feet. “Show me.”

“Ah ah,” Lande waved his finger. “Give us the name first. Who did you see? Who took the Jade Scarab?”

“Your mother,” Casander said, baring tiny fangs. “She’s put on a bit of weight. No sneaking around for that one.”

“Hilarious.”

“Thank you, I’ll be here all week.”

Lande reached for the letter. “If I walk out that door, you’ll be here for the rest of your life.”

Casander growled deep in his throat and let loose a hiss. “Fine!” he said. “Fine. It was Kyger the Muddled.”

Lande’s hand stopped an inch from the letter. Weylin turned to look back at the cat in the cage.

“Kyger?” He couldn’t believe what he was hearing. What game was this stupid cat playing? ”Enough with your lies. Kyger couldn’t conjure a sandwich without a guidebook. She doesn’t possess the strength to defeat two of the Agency’s finest battle wizards and steal this Jade Scarab.”

“Agreed,” Lande said, snatching the silver letter off the counter.

Casander began to pace circles in his cage. “I’m not lying!” The cat hissed. “I know what I saw. It was Kyger. She appeared from nowhere like some dark specter, glowing eyes and pale face in the shadows. It was terrifying. What she did to Ash…” The cat trailed off with a shiver.

Weylin was unconvinced. He said as much.

“Use your magic,” Casander said. “Check my memories, if you don’t believe me. She can get around the Vault’s security measures with her spells, but she can’t touch my memory. Check it, damn you. And give me my letter!”

Weylin exchanged a look with Lande.

“Ok, Cas,” Weylin said. “But I swear if you’re wasting my time, I’ll use your pelt to wipe my ass.”

**Ten minutes later…**

“It really was Kyger,” Lande whispered, staring at nothing. “How could we miss this? How did she gain the strength?”

“She isn’t alone.” Weylin felt something dark and implacable stirring out in the world, a malevolent force waking from an ancient slumber. He couldn’t explain it, but the feeling was there. He knew it was there. Unseen eyes watching, waiting.

“She’s a Dread Reaper, Lande,” Weylin said. “That comes with power, but a terrible price.”

“The Old Lady is going to be furious.” Lande began to pace. “One of our own, a Dread Reaper?”

“The director will understand,” Weylin idly popped the catch on Casander’s cage and turned toward the door. “She will grumble and she will snarl, and in the end she will set us to hunting down Kyger the Killer and bringing her to justice.”

“The Jade Scarab, Weylin,” Lande’s eyes were haunted. “We must recover it at all costs. Nothing else matters.”

Casander took two steps out of the cage and gave a mighty stretch with both paws out front. “Kyger the Killer, you think that up all by yourself, Weylin? Did it hurt?”

Weylin ignored the cat. “Ash and Ghymora are dead, Lande, and all you can worry about is some silly trinket?” He fought down his outrage. “I’ve known Ash since he was a boy! Ghymora since—“

“You don’t get it, do you?” Lande cut him off sharply. “The Jade Scarab is a dimensional prison, enchanted with powerful wards.”

Weylin looked skeptical. “A prison? For what?”

“Not what,” Lande’s face was ashen, and his voice grave. “Who.”

Casander jumped down from the counter and walked over to Weylin, brushing against his leg. “Look at big bad Lande,” the cat purred. “Nothing but a scaredy cat. And you Weylin, I expected better.”

“Hush,” Weylin said to Casander. He looked at Lande. Concern stirred in his gut. “What do you mean who? Are you saying a person is imprisoned in that scarab?”

“Not a person,” Lande said and rose to his feet. He adjusted his suit and combed his fingers through his hair. “I have to see the director at once. She will know what to do.”

Weylin held out a hand. “You just hold on a damn minute there now, Lande. What are you talking about? Who is imprisoned in that thing?”

Lande looked at him. His eyes were wide and wild, hunted. “Aramaris the Black. It’s his phylactery.”

Weylin rocked back on his heels. The lichlord of Gravesend?

“Impossible. Aramaris the Black died a thousand years ago. Are you telling me that the Agency has kept the soul of the most powerful lichlord who ever lived trapped within a piece of jeweled jade and stored in the Vault all this time?”

Weylin was dumbfounded.

Casander laughed, then hacked up a furball on Weylin’s boot. “A gift for my friend.”

Weylin shooed the cat away with a gentle shove of his foot.

“Why?” Weylin demanded. “Why would they do such a thing? How could they be so foolish!”

“Only the director and the council has those answers.”

Weylin drew in a deep breath and squared his shoulders. “Then perhaps it’s time we asked them.”

“Will they have catnip?” Casander asked, still brushing against Weylin.

“Shut up, Casander!” Weylin and Lande snapped in unison.

“What?” The cat looked genuinely wounded. “What did I say?”

Lande nodded. “Yes,” he said. “Past time we had answers to what’s really going on here.”

Weylin smiled despite the dread he felt. “Just like old times, eh? You ready?“

“Indeed.” Lande scrubbed a hand down his face and looked resigned. “Time to put a stop to these schemes and bring Ashlin’s killer to justice.”",1,1745035207.0,Glacialwrites,0,1.0,False

This time I bring you a novel with a simple magic system: mages have a system of cores and modules embedded in their souls, and use the souls of others to fuel this arcane motor. Shackle moar souls, do bigga magic kinda deal.

So far, so good, so normal, right?

Well, in this story you follow a rookie cop that's a part of a corrupt organization. Not someone who wants to change the world, not someone who wants to cleanse the name of the Retrievers (the magic cops, not the yellow/brown/black dogs that already have really good PR in most of the western world) and not someone looking to climb through the ranks, either: he's too lazy to climb. Like, that's somebody's else's problem.

No, Saon Ladius wants to coast by in life, be an ass to everybody in a kilometer radius, and release his unquestionably fashionable inner demons upon the world whenever the situation calls for it.

(I had way more written but a blackout spirited it all away from me. The gist is as follows: Saon is an ass but not a murderhobo or a DC Joker type character. He's extravagant, and goes out of his way to annoy people, but doesn't rejoice in torture. He doesn't needlessly kick puppies, but anyone harmless to him, he will probably pull on their leg, weird them out or rant about a touchy subject in their presence. And proudly stand a non-lethal beating for it. Art is supposed to hurt, people!) 

\---

Okay, so, resuming, what does this story have:

\-A system based on trapping souls inside one's sacromotor (sacred engine, a sort of arrangement of chambers inside one's own soul) where power and versatility depend more or less directly on the number of souls trapped. 

\-A protagonist whose cheat is being immune to empathy and blind to evil, in addition to being impervious to stomach and liver issues (Presumably, as no normal GI tract can consume so much shitty coffee and live to tell the tale. )

  
Yeah, no, he's not a special little chosen boi. He's just a cunt with a badge (The badge is a cute Golden Retriever holding a soul) and a soul full of sacrificed crows. 

\-First person narration. 

\-Dark humor. Lots of it. Saon has severe verbal incontinence like, all the time. And he's the narrator. 

  
I made the cover in poor people Canva (free account) and had a lot of fun doing so. To my knowledge no AI was used in it (I am unsure how Canva procures their assets and fonts, however.) 

[Bird watchers please don't judge if those aren't crow silhouettes.](https://preview.redd.it/75fdw8mw6pve1.png?width=1410&format=png&auto=webp&s=72a5abc1f59a77d4f9803ca6c184ed00ae5b00bb)

  


Lastly, a disclaimer: My depiction of the Retrievers is not based on any particular  real life group of law enforcers, but on a collection of undesirable traits some of them possess, all baked into a fictional organization. Societies need systems of law enforcement and many do have problems with excessive violence or overstepping of boundaries in them: depiction of abuses of this nature and the protagonist engaging in them does not mean I endorse those things in real life. This is a story about the ""lesser evil"" embracing his role, about a man consistently being on the wrong side of history out of his own volition. He knows his actions are shunned, he knows many will consider him little more than a  criminal pawn of the Governor.  He's planned to become an over the top illusion-focused character as the novel advances.

## Who Created Alma Deltix?

There isn’t a lot of public information about the individual or firm behind Alma Deltix, which is pretty common with some of these newer platforms. However, from what I’ve gathered, it seems to be developed by a team of fintech and AI specialists—similar to platforms like Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge.

While the lack of transparency may raise eyebrows, this isn’t necessarily a red flag. Many legit platforms keep their internal teams private, especially in highly competitive markets like algorithmic trading. Still, I’d love to see more details about their background in the future.

## Is Alma Deltix a Scam?

That’s the million-dollar question, right? So far, **there are no red flags** that scream scam. The platform functions as promised, withdrawals are processed (though they can take a day or two), and most users report positive experiences.

That said, always remember:
- Only invest what you can afford to lose.

We started chatting outside Temple about the play in game, Monte being out, Scott Perry as the new GM, and where the team is headed.

While we’re talking, my friend sees an SUV pull up and says “I think that’s Monte McNair.”  The driver parks, exits and I couldn’t believe how strange the timing was - it was Monte!  He walks past us towards Temple and I blurt out “thank you for what you did for us the past five years.”  He stops, thanked me, asked my name my friend’s name, and shook our hands.  He added, “it was a fun ride,” thanked us again, told us to take care and then went on with his day.

Nothing juicy, just wanted to share my story of meeting a guy who, love him or hate him, seems like a good dude who wanted to do well for the organization.  Not every decision he made was the right one, and at times was frustrating, but he took this sorry ass team and helped make it fun to watch for a brief moment.  I will always be grateful for seeing another playoff game in person when I was lucky enough to attend Game 1 in 2023.  I waited nearly half my life to experience that again and seeing that win moved me to tear - I almost wish I was kidding.

Anyway, I hope Monte finds a new home soon, I’m sure he’ll land on his feet somewhere.  Here’s to hoping (I know, a dangerous thought) that Vivek doesn’t manage to fuck things up…again.

3:04 p.m. CST — Mid-flight, Somewhere Over the Midwest

  
The Lockheed L-049 Constellation growls through the upper atmosphere, its four propellers droning like distant thunder pressed against tin.

Inside the cabin, the air is dry, faintly metallic. Upholstered seats creak beneath the weight of their passengers. A ceiling fan spins lazily overhead.

Jacob stares out the oval window. Below, the world is a patchwork quilt of darkness—highways lit like veins, cities glowing like infected wounds. He blinks slowly. Exhaustion weighs heavy, but something in his gut won’t let his body rest.

Nor will his mind: Twenty years. Why is he calling me now? 

He tears open the complimentary peanut pack—three peanuts, two broken. The wax paper crinkles like tissue in a coffin. He chews without tasting, salt clinging to the back of his throat. 

He flips through the in-flight magazine. Ads for Bulova watches. Diet secrets. A too-wide smiling family on vacation frozen in manufactured joy. An article about a scientist examining the most fundamental mechanics of reality.

He closes it. Orders a drink. The flight attendant—a tall brunette, pale, no name tag—delivers it silently. He thanks her. She doesn’t respond. Just walks away.

Her expression doesn’t change. Not when he thanks her. Not when she turns away. She moves like a wind-up doll on a dying spring. She doesn’t smile like the flight attendants do in the posters.

He takes a sip. Ice clinks. The bourbon tastes like copper and ashes.

“Funny thing, perception.”

Jacob slowly turns his head.

And would have jumped out of his seat had he not been strapped in.

In his jacket’s breast pocket, the egg’s pulse suddenly leaps.

The man in the aisle seat wasn’t there before. Or maybe he was, and Jacob just didn’t notice. He’s wiry, with a face that looks like it was sketched in haste—too angular, too sharp. His eyes gleam with some private joke. His accent is...unplaceable. He knows this face from somewhere. A photo. From the science article. Or...was it looking back at him…from the page? 

“E-excuse me?” Jacob stammers.

“Your drink.” The man taps the glass on Jacob’s tray table with two fingers. A soft clink. “How do you know it’s real?”

Jacob turns, startled. He’s sure the seat was empty a moment ago. The man beside him sits with one leg crossed over the other, a faint smirk curling the corners of his mouth. Sharp features, suit pressed to perfection, eyes gleaming with a kind of intellectual mischief.

Jacob stares at the cup. “I…watched the stewardess hand it to me.”

“Did you?” The man tilts his head. “Or do you merely *remember* it that way?”

Jacob narrows his eyes. “I remember the interaction.”

“Mm.” The man’s tone is almost amused. “Memory is not proof. It is inference. A story your mind tells to connect the dots. But what if the dots were arranged for you?”

Jacob lets the silence hang between them. The hum of the aircraft fills the space, along with the occasional rattle from the galley cart up front.

The man leans in slightly. “You believe in consistency. In continuity. You think because one moment follows another, they are linked by cause and effect. But the truth, Jacob, is that you are only ever in the moment you’re in. Everything else is...inference. Projection. Wishful thinking.”

Jacob feels a flicker of unease, “How do you know my name?”

The man ignores the question entirely. “Do you believe in paradoxes, Jacob?”

He gestures to the drink again. “You believe you’re drinking that because your senses confirm it. But what if I told you this moment—this plane, this drink, even this conversation—was the product of overlapping probabilities collapsing into coherence only because you’re watching it happen?”

Jacob doesn’t reply. The air feels thinner now, the space between heartbeats longer.

The man offers a hand. “Schrödinger.”

Of course it is, Jacob thinks.

\*\*\*

Jacob blinks, “Archer.”

“Schrödinger.” Jacob says flatly, as if the name might unstick reality.

The man nods, utterly unbothered by the disbelief in Jacob’s voice. “I prefer Erwin on casual flights, but yes.”

Jacob turns slightly in his seat, eyeing him like a sleeping snake. “You’re not exactly who I expected to sit next to.”

A faint smile passes across Schrödinger ‘s lips. “No one ever is.”

Jacob looks away, scanning the cabin. No one else seems to notice. The passengers are in their own worlds—newspapers, crossword puzzles, solitaire, bad coffee. It's like Schrödinger isn’t even there.

Of course it is. It’s already been a weird day, why change things now? Jacob thinks.

“Mind if I ask you a question?” Schrödinger asks, without waiting for permission. “Do you think it’s possible to believe two contradictory things at once?”

Jacob snorts. “It’s called politics.”

A glint of amusement dances in the physicist’s eye. “Touché. But I mean personally. Can you accept that something might be true and false…simultaneously?”

“I’m not a fan of riddles,” Jacob mutters.

“No. But you’re a fan of answers, like most people.” He leans in conspiratorially to whisper, “But reality doesn’t care what you’re comfortable with.”

He reaches into the inside pocket of his jacket and produces a coin. It’s old, even ancient—worn nearly smooth—and he balances it on the back of his fingers.

“This is you,” he says. “Or rather, it’s your decision. Heads, you trust what you see. Tails, you trust what you feel. But the coin, Jacob…”



“…the coin is always spinning. We just pretend it lands somewhere.”

He flips it. Jacob watches it arc up, glittering once in the cabin light—then vanish. Gone.

No sign of it falling. No sound of it landing. 

And then the plane drops.

Just for a second. Not turbulence. A vertical lurch like gravity misfired.

Passengers gasp. A drink spills somewhere behind him. Schrödinger doesn’t so much as blink.

But he does smile.

Jacob blinks again. The smile has vanished. 

Jacob shakes his head sharply to clear the illusion he clearly just experienced, “Cute. Magic trick?”

“Perhaps,” Schrödinger shrugs. “Or perhaps you’re asleep, dreaming of waking. Or awake in one, dreaming of truth. How would you know?”

Jacob doesn’t answer. He’s too busy glancing under his seat.

Schrödinger grins. “Open-mindedness, Jacob. The ability to hold uncertainty without needing it resolved. Most minds snap shut like mousetraps the moment paradox enters the room.”

Jacob leans back in his seat. “And yours doesn’t?”

This earns a faint chuckle, “Oh, mine broke a long time ago. I simply live among the pieces.”

A crackle of the intercom jolts Jacob slightly—just a flight attendant announcing turbulence. But when he turns back—

The seat beside him is empty.

*Sure, why not.*

No coat. No drink. Not even the faintest imprint in the cushion.

Just the whisper of a presence that may or may not have been real.

The plane lifts off. Jacob leans back, eyes closed, letting the hum of the engines blur his thoughts.

A breath brushes his ear.

A whisper follows.

“You think this time will be different.”

And in his breast pocket, the orb emits a pulse that Jacob registers as a shriek of terror.

1k2mxpy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIO/comments/1k2mxpy/am_i_f23_overreacting_to_comments_made_from_a/,Am I (f23) overreacting to comments made from a coworker (m40s)?,"Making this in on a throwaway account. 

I started working for a cell phone company almost 2 months ago. The job is inside Walmart, and I sell prepaid cell phone plans and phones. (I’ll call it Company A). There is a different competing phone company (I’ll call it Company B) who sells postpaid cell phone plans, but we work alongside each other in the same department. 

A week after I started, a new rep for Company B came to my store. I’ll call him Evan. He was very friendly and professional and in his 40s. We developed a good working relationship and over the course of a month and a half I would have considered him somewhat of a friend- not close, but we did talk at work and he would text me if I missed work to check on me. When I got to know him I learned he’s freshly out of prison for DUIs and lives in a sober home. I always respected him and it seemed like he had gotten his life on track, and he never made me feel uncomfortable. 

Last week, he started talking about wanting to move out of his sober home because of lack of privacy. He asked what I pay for rent, and I gave him information about my apartments. I even sent him a text from my complex talking about a referral program, and he said he wanted to try and move there. I thought nothing of it. 

A few days go by and I get a call from him at 9pm. He asked me if he could stay at my house that night because he was no longer staying at the sober home. I told him I would, but that I didn’t have room- my apartment is a studio and I don’t even have a couch, just bar stools and my bed. He told me he didn’t mind if we had to share a bed. I wasn’t comfortable and just said again that I didn’t have room. Still, alarm bells weren’t really going off because he seemed casual about it. 

I came to work the next day and found him sitting in front of the bathroom. I noticed that he looked like someone had hit him in the face. I could immediately tell he was drunk and he was slurring. I felt sad for him because I didn’t want his life to go off the rails again. 

He got increasingly weird throughout the day. It was blatantly obvious. When I came back from lunch, he pushed me to make a statement on the intercom about phone deals. I told him that the script was from Company B, not my own. He was incredibly persistent though and was kind of standing over me, he touched my back. I wanted him to go away so I made the announcement even though it wasn’t mine to make. 

Directly after this, Evan started talking about his manager, who I’ll call Steph. Steph also gave him rides to and from work, and to my understanding he was going to stay at her house. He started talking about how hot Steph was, and how “he’d go for it if she weren’t gay”. Then, he said “why are there so many gay women in this town? Why are you gay? Did a man hurt you?”

I’m gay myself and he never acted like it was a big deal or a problem, so this shocked me. I told him no and that I was just born like this. He said “You don’t like dick at all?” After I told him no he said it was a waste. He asked why I wouldn’t let him stay over the night before. I repeated that I didn’t have room. He said “I could have kept you warm with my breath!” 

I found the Walmart employees I work alongside and found out that he’d been creepy that day with three of them (hugging them, touching them). They didn’t know him hardly at all, he didn’t usually talk to them. He said to one of them “I know you don’t like me but I can tell I’m growing on you” and touched her lower back. He also showed her something on his phone and porn was visible. I also found out that he had gotten into a fight with 4 people at the sober home, which explains his facial injuries. 

We reported him to the Walmart manager, took statements, and waited while they told him he had to leave. Immediately as this was happening, I got two texts from him. They were pretty innocent- he just sent me a smiley emoji, and in the next message just said “Coffee?”

I feel super uncomfortable with all of this. I never responded but didn’t want to block him, because I want to be vigilant and know if he’s trying to contact me. At 1am that same night, he sent me another message that just said “U up?”

I talked to HR today and an investigation was being done. They removed him from my store but he might be at a different Walmart. His own manager was in store today and complained about how a “super aggressive Company A rep got one of my guys thrown out of the store”. I just  laughed it off, I didn’t want him to know it was me. The funny thing is that I’m the most non confrontational person I know- almost pathologically so to be honest. 

I feel so on edge and I don’t know if I’m overreacting. He knows the apartments I live in, but he doesn’t know my apartment number. I feel so many things- mad at myself for trusting him and being naive, scared, guilty because he might lose his job. He’s never been overtly threatening, but it still just feels so jarring. I’m the only coworker he’s texted out of work. 

Is it overreacting to be so paranoid? I don’t know what the safest steps to take are. Should I continue to ignore? Or block? Or set a boundary? I haven’t explicitly told him I’m uninterested. I’ve never experienced anything like this. The other manager made me feel like I shouldn’t have gotten him thrown out. ",2,1745032601.0,AIO,5,1.0,False

**May 23                               CW: Sexy times, alcohol, Thoughts of self-harm**

“Good day young lady.  Come on over to the conference room.”  I look at the Firm name and smile.   As we walk passed the lettering I vocalize just loud enough to have Gretchen hear.  “Still needs a Smith at the end.”  She giggles and we get to the conference room.

“Maybelle” is there.  I nod.  She is there with Fredericks, Titania, and two more gentleman.  One is introduced as Mr. Rogers.  I squelch the giggle. The other is Mr. Kidman.

Both are smiling and I begin to wonder if this isn’t some plot to dig their claws a little deeper into me. Nah.

Fredericks begins talking and the father figure I had expected is gone. In the place is a pure pro. “He explains Roger’s will be working on Maybelle’s behalf and has been her lawyer for such matters for a decade now. Fredericks will be my representative.  Mr. Kidman represents Titania.

“This normal?”

“No.  We can get another firm to represent you if you like. Same cost, we will pay.” 

I take a deep breath and chill for a second. It feels okay. “No, it is fine.”

Mab nods. “I am representing myself, really. I sometimes miss details that are trivial but need to be dealt with and Rogers is a near perfect machine in those ways.  He is one of the few people I trust aside from Fredericks.”

“High praise.”  *If they knew how high, they would be both ecstatic and terrified.* 

Fredericks begins, “I am here to make sure your concerns are not squashed and to answer your questions.  Maybelle trusts I won’t cause her harm in our dealings so this should hopefully be smooth?”

She nods.

We spend hours hammering out details. In the end I own a 40% share in a new company. Both of the Queens elected to have only 30%. The company has an antiquities trading house and a coffee shop franchise.  Titania, or Tiffany as she is called here, is putting up a substantial amount of cash to buy into this stake. My company’s assets were such that I could justify the 40% share. I then pull out the candidates for heading the company’s financials and say I will hire one.

“I think it is a waste of money to do that.  I didn’t make that company to waste all the profit on someone unimportant to me.”

I chuckle and shake my head. “Of course not. But let me point out something. This company has been running at 8 figures for revenue with someone at the head that only has 168 hours in a week.   You have more businesses than this one.  One of those businesses produces much more than this one does and you dedicate much more time to that business. This will lighten the load and help with executive decision making.  I also have a business that takes up to  60 hours a week from me much of the time. We need sleep. I especially need my beauty sleep. I mean look at me. I need the help.”

That joke lands like a tank. Titania, Mab, and Frederick’s all give me looks. Titania seems angry. The other two look sad. Wait. Mab looks sad at me cracking that joke? 

I press on.  “So let me get someone that can help us grow the trading business as it has been stagnant, and let’s both enjoy having lives. I personally think that no matter how amazing you are, that elixir of yours is something that can give a rhino a heart attack. Maybe slow down a little, good lady?” 

She laughs and relents immediately.  “Fine, do it your way. I am just going to get money passively from that enterprise and enjoy more ambitious pursuits.”   Frederick’s looks at me in shock. Titania looks absolutely terrified at this.  I shrug.

“We have a final thing to discuss.  The name of this new entity.”  Fredericks looks around the table.  Titania shrugs.  Mab waves her hand as if she could not care less.  They all look at me.  I smile.  Yes, I have a name, a name my father would high five me for if he was alive.

“The Cafae.  Spelled Capital See, aye, eff, aye, eee.  I will also accept the eff being a capital.”

I smile as the two queens level glares at me that would likely have sent me fleeing in terror 3 years ago.  “Got something better?”

Mab gets a pained look on her face.  “No, and I am so very mad I have never thought of it.  That is brilliant.”

Fredericks gives me a look when the Queens are talking. It is one of understanding and thanks. He got the pun.  He looks at “Maybelle” and raises an eyebrow.  I begin whistling and looking anywhere but at her.  He nods and smiles. With that done, our lawyers will begin contacting the owner of our building and we will take out the necessary loans to buy it. Paying back the loan will require quite a bit of revenue. I worry, not many solid gold or silver coins have been showing up. I know I was hoping for real money, but it would be a shame if that whole thing didn’t end with the funds I was anticipating.

Still. I have a shot. I am going to take it.

 

 

**May 26**

Titania is in the shop today. She is sipping her drink at our usual “conference” table. “I am going on break, Lemar.”  He nods and waves to Titania who seems distracted.

I sit down across from her, and she looks up at me. “I have never seen the Queen of Air and Darkness acquiesce before.  Compromises can be made with her.  But for her to acquiesce with almost no pushback?  She fights anything I suggest, tooth and nail.  And even afterwards she is cold.” She sips her drink and shakes her head.

“Imagine my surprise when she said she had a possible investment I would not want to miss out on. And imagine that surprise when I go to a legal office and you walk in.”

“Must have been shocking. I mean, I was pretty damn surprised.  I almost couldn’t believe it when she saw my plan to buy the shop’s building and decided to help.”

Titania drinks and looks at me. “We have been battling in petty ways for eons. And suddenly she decides not just to take one of the many olive branches I have extended her way but to extend one of her own to me.  I don’t know what the future brings. But it seems to be less filled with animosity of late. I do appreciate that.”

I bow my head a little. “I get it. And I am happy she brought you in. Without your support I don’t think any of this would be possible.”

“Please, she can afford to back you financially by herself. The Queen of Air is a force unto her own in business.  Never going too far, to avoid attention, while crushing whatever she sees as a goal. I barely did anything there.”

I smile. “That too. But I meant here. The place where both Courts find peace.  I know your Court has had a huge part to play in my happiness. For that I am ever grateful.”  I put my hand on hers and she seems to break out of the melancholy and looks me in the eyes for the first time since I sat down.  She smiles. She is gorgeous.

“I see why my husband fancies you so very much. If you ever do decide to bed him, please do keep in mind that we share many things, including our taste in women.”  With a wink that leaves my knees wobbly she leaves.  *Need to remember I am in a monogamous relationship and straight…. Just because she turns me on…*

***“****I heard that.  Mab may have gotten your first kiss, but I am shooting for more.****”***

I am so fucked when it comes to that Fae. Maybe literally if I don’t watch it. Also, I need to get ready for my date tonight. Rule 3, Pat, rule 3.

 

**May 27**

My date with Ricardo goes well.  Very well. It is morning, I am the little spoon. I can’t complain here.  Jackie is being a living typhoon outside my room, so I can complain there.  I am maybe half asleep, closer to one-third-awake if I am honest. I still manage to extricate myself from my embrace, angrily, and put on a shirt.  I wear panties to bed so this will be enough, I think. 

I walk into the living room to see a red-headed force of nature pulling couch cushions out and digging around the inside of the couch.  She lost keys, wallet, phone, or something else critical.  I yawn and announce myself. “Morning.  What you need help finding?”

“Go back to bed.  Sorry I am being loud.  Just go to bed, honey.”  She stops as she finally looks up at me. 

*“That’s a sight…”*

Wow, I actually heard Jackie broadcast…?  That’s new.  And not in the shop…

My half-asleep brain realizes my bed head is probably a little crazy.  It is only a bob, still all over the place I bet.  I yawn again.  I am getting goosebumps.  It’s cold, maybe I should have put on pants.  “What are you looking for, I will help.  I can be useful.  The sooner you find it, the sooner I can go back to bed and snuggle.”

“I really want that necklace Todd gave me.  There’s been a guy in class that hasn’t approached me since I started wearing it…”  She looks frantic. 

I recall her and Cindy were having a make out session on the couch 2 days ago, but the second base action didn’t actually start until they got on the recliner together.  I walk over to the recliner, bend over to check the sides, find it and yank. I turn around after pulling out the necklace.   “Cindy musta yanked it off with your bra.  You probably only noticed the bra when you cleaned up.  See? Useful.  Okay, here you go.”

She walks up to me smiling, turns around and lifts her hair. I clasp it on her neck.  I am still half asleep and cold, but I can manage this. My brain isn’t thinking and I kiss her cheek as I put it on.  I smile at her.  She grabs my hand and pulls me in close.  I lean in.  We are cheek to cheek with her in my embrace for at least a long minute. No talking, just being.  *This is nice.  So warm.*

“You should go back to bed.  Sweet dreams.  Get some when he wakes up.”  She sighs a bit, pulls me down to face level, kisses me on the cheek and puts the cushions back on the couch as I go to the bathroom.  I do my business, and I wave as she is dressed and heading out the door.

I am nearly in bed when I realize I didn’t have to take off my panties when I did my business.  Oh, yea, like Jackie’s necklace, I guess they got pulled off and discarded somewhere.  I look down.  My shirt is so threadbare it is basically see through and with it being cold, it is not leaving much to the imagination.  I could cut glass with these nipples.  Oh and my shirt doesn’t reach my legs.  I was just standing out there, nips and other parts for her to see.  Whoops.  I guess I know what she meant by sight.  Wait, was she looking when I bent over the chair? 

I’ll apologize later.  I must snuggle and put this choice of clothes to good use.

 

**June 12**

 I am signing something that has way more zeroes in it than anything in my life has a right to have. I just bought a building. A building that houses both companies owned by my bigger company. A building that is now technically mine.

I can fix that door so it is no longer “technically” ADA compliant.  Now ALL my clients can come in without hassle. I can carve out some of the mutual space and make a little apartment in case of emergencies.  I can do so much.  I can keep Connie’s tree safe.

“So, when are we having a party to celebrate?” Those words come out of “Maybelle,” Also known as Mab, Queen of Air and Darkness.  I am unsure if this is weirder than the day we met and the 5 quads of espresso…

“What now?”

“We must celebrate you owning this building. It is simply a need.”  To her left, the Queen of Land and Light, Titania, nods. Did I mistakenly fall into the upside down?

“I hadn’t thought of it.”  Not a lie.

“Perhaps we can close the shop and have a celebration there?  We will bring libations!” Titania is hilarious sometimes. “I will convince Obie to come with clothing!”

Fredericks laughs at “libations” and nods. “You have earned a celebration, young lady.”

Somehow within an hour the plan is set and the shop will be hosting a private celebration after 11 pm. I had zero input or say in this. I feel like I just finished a roller coaster ride.

**Late June 12**

The place is packed.  I am worried.  You see*, I am kind of a lightweight when it comes to booze.  And EVERY FUCKING FAE I KNOW HAS GIVEN ME A DRINK*.  I would be worried about accepting food or drink from Fae, but this is my place and they take drinks and food from me all the time, so if they wanna play that way, THEY ARE SOOOOOOO FUCKED.  *I could use with a little less spinny-spinny of the room, tho.*  That would be nice.  Also, I am pretty sure someone slipped some sort of aphrodisiac because *right now, I would say yes if Obie asked me to go into the office and do a little hip slamming.* 

I see Jane talking with a couple of mermaids. They are talking about her transition. They are really keen on it. She started at the shop as Jake. 

“Things got really low for me.  I wasn’t the real me, you know?  There weren’t many people I could talk to.  It got so low I called a hotline.  Trans Lifeline has people that are like me.  Saved me.  Working here I realized that I had people I could talk to in person as well.  Speaking of…”

I look at Jane and give her a hug.  “I wish I had known you were suffering.”  I look at the others, “You know she when she told me she was changing I asked and now I know to use she/her and got the right name even before the legal name change.”  I look back at Jane.  “I wasn’t gonna hurt you sweetie, not if I could avoid it.  Have I been good on that?  I don’t think I have slipped up, but if I do, you tell me to fix my shit, got it?  I mean, Rule 5: No judgment. We deal with non-binary elves here, least I can do is treat you well.  And you’re tall like me so we know the struggle with clothing.  GAWD!!!”

She hugs me and I get pulled away.  “Love ya, later! Oh look another drink!”  Guess being the guest of honor or something has downsides.

“Pat!  You have to settle something for us!”  We have a little bet going and need to find out who wins.”  I see Todd, Pat, Grey, and Heca.  They are all drinking. I stumble over and smile at all my pretty friends.

“Okay, we need to know who terrified a normie the most by mistake the most. Winner gets a small favor. I laugh. This is gonna be good.

   Todd looks at me. “I was playing League and I was on my a-hole account doing my standard throwing when…”

“You really think you can get away with not explaining that?” I look at him and smile.

“So I made an account that is just there to piss everyone on my team off by getting myself killed on the enemy as much as I can just to grief them.”

I nod sagely. I think it looks sagely. Sure, we will go with sagely.  Todd continues. “And my teammate is livid. He somehow tracked me down.  It was like the 3^(rd) time we were in the same team. He lost it and sent me my address saying he was gonna kick my little ass. I said to come get it.”

Oh boy.

“Like a week later my doorbell rings and I think my pizza got there early when a guy with a pipe hits me over the head. I was so startled I dropped my glamour and rubbed my head. Dude peed his pants while running away.”

“Niiiice.”  I am laughing. “Pat?”

“Can I go last?” Pat is almost painfully shy.  I am fine with giving her a pass.

“Sure, Grey?”

“I used to be a lot more migratory. So, this is near South America.  I am in full shark mermaid mode when I see what I hope is a seal for dinner. I reach up and grab it. I start pulling it under when I realize it is a leg, not a flipper. I grabbed some bonehead on a surfboard. He was like half a kilometer or more from shore. After almost drowning this poor sap I put him back on his board and in my broken Spanish tell him I am sorry I almost drowned you, I thought you were a seal. You should be more careful.  I smiled at him and said he did look tasty, but I didn’t think he’d survive long enough underwater to fuck, let alone climax so it would be a waste.  He swam really fast…”

I am sort of stunned. “Damn girl, you crazy.  She’s winning so far.  Heca, your go.”

“I was leading a little boy out of the woods when his mother showed up. She had been frantically looking for him.  I handed him to her. She thanked me and off we went. Well, the next thing I know, I have found this same boy in the woods four times. His mother grows a little bolder each time. Will I see you again? Who should I thank?  You are very beautiful…. Eventually I just end up asking her if a single night with me would make it so she would stop letting her child run around the woods alone.  She says yes.”

We all look at her.  “Haven’t you mentioned spending years with someone if they get your motor running?”

She looks down. “It ended up being most of a moon. She was quite adept with her tongue and an eager learner.  After we are done her son finds me and tells me his momma has been the happiest she has ever bred since his dad died. He asked if he could learn how to make his momma that happy too. “

We all stare at her.

“You didn’t.”

“Of course not. I HAVE STANDARDS!!  Instead, I took him back and told her what he had asked. I told her I would teach him if she did not seek happiness for them both. She was gone the next day. I scared her off… too bad too, she could lick the bark off a sequoia.”

“JESUS CHRIST HECA!”

After the laughing was done. I render judgement.  “That wasn’t scary for her at the end. You saying you would teach him sure was, but it sounds like you pushed her to try to be more.  Nope.”

“Okay other Pat, give.  Oh hey, my drink magically refilled…”

“Um… well, I told a boy I liked that I had been told not to eat him, like for real, and he was really nice and I loved the way he smelled and I could just live inside his skin with him and be happy.  I kinda screwed up what Jackie suggested.”

I am staring at this woman as are the other three.

“Wait, that explains what Ricardo said about his cousin leaving the state and why he is scared of you…”

“He is scared of me?”

“Darling, he asked if you were a serial killer.”

“What did you say?!”

“No, but the verdict is out on Jackie. OUCH!!!”  I rub my arm in pain as *SHE HIT ME!*

The redhead had snuck up on me and was glaring. Whoops.

“Yea, sorry, Pat wins. Grey is second. You other two are weak sauce. WEAK!  Speaking of sauce, I need more…”

 Sam the Leprechaun, walks up and hands me a beer.  Awww, this is adorable. What a fucking pussy. He thinks this is gonna do much to me?  Hahahaha Sam decides to yell out so everyone stops talking.  I would ask what he’s up to, but I know it is like actually 3 feet tall…  hahahaha.  Maybe I should not be drinking this much? Nah.  Future me can fuck off.

“A toast. May you live long and happily.”  Dude is a little tipsy.  Haha.  You know what, I can’t let him get the last word. 

Fine, do you want a toast?  “A toast!! May all who come to my place find peace, calm, happiness, and may they follow the rules!!”  
I hear an elated Mab, Titania, Oberon, Jack, and about a dozen others speak in unison, “To peace, calm, happiness and following the rules!”  I did good.  The room is super spinny and glowing a little bit.  Yay me!!!  I need another drink…

Awww. That is so sweet. *Man, Titania and Obie look really tasty right now. Maybe I should get in on a sammich?* 

He turns and licks his lips at me.

“Alright, I am cutting you off, darling. You are starting to broadcast so much it is making Obie horny.”

“Good, tell him to come over and start with the penis dispensing.”

She stares daggers at me.  “Ricardo.”

“Fine, we can wait until my honey is at our place and they can make with the Eiffel Tower cosplay.”  Did I really say that?  Yea.  Future me is going to hate present me.  She can fuck off, present me wants some cock.

“How about I call Ricardo and he meets us at our place before you make some bad choices permanently?”  
I scoop up Jackie in my arms.  “I am drunk, and you aren’t flirting with me.  What is up with that?”  She looks upset with me asking.  Past me is a fucking moron.  Present me

Is seriously wondering if she can break a corporate rule and knows future me is going to hate this train.

“You are an idiot sometimes.  Come on, you need to go home.”

I am sure my pouting works on her.  “No kiss?”

Her anger almost sobers me up.  “No, remember, not allowed.”  *Dammit Pat.*

I nod, yea, bosses can’t do anything with employees.  *So sad.  Why am I sad about hearing that?*

Jackie smiles at me and waves to everyone.  Lemar will close the place up.  I gratefully fall in the back of a taxi and buckle up.  Jackie and I lean up against each other and we head home.  Yea, future me is going to be sure present me is an asshole.  She is gonna hate me.

 

**June 13**

Fuck, past me was a complete fucking bitch.  You asshole, you said some shitty things to Jackie.  I still haven’t opened my eyes and this hangover is already a monster.  I check, night shirt on, panties.  No pants.  Warm.  Snuggled up as big spoon today.  Ricardo is next to me?  His hair is a mop, like always. Awesome.  I think I will just move my hand and get myself momma’s favorite hangover remedy…

THAT IS NOT A PENIS.  WAIT, I HAVE A HAND FULL OF BOOB!

That is definitely NOT an outie but an innie.  Thank god I stopped before I got beyond the realization.

Okay, so who the fuck is in my bed, and are they awake?  Also, why is she not wearing panties?

“Maybe you should ask permission before trying to do that, Pat?” 

Jackie?!

“Why are you in my bed?  I thought you were Ricardo.  I have so much crust on my eyes.  This is such a bad headache I haven’t opened my eyes.”  This isn’t a lie, but I am suddenly hating past me even more.

“Well, that explains a lot.  You were so messed up I got in bed with you because I was worried you would sleep on your back, puke, and die on me.  Too much irony.  I did have to roll you on your side and be the little spoon to get you not to roll on your back. Figured messy hair was worth it if it happened. Also, I am glad you moved your hand.  But, um, your other hand is still on my boob.”

“So big, so soft.”

“DAMMIT PAT!”

I don’t get it, she has been hoping for me to molest her for ages.  I guess I am still not totally sober because I kinda like this.

She flips around and faces me.  “Open your eyes.”

“I don’t wanna.”  *Hahaha, can’t make me.*

She is not having it.  “Patricia Rae Wallace, open your eyes!”

I do.  I don’t really have a choice.  They open on their own. *She is so pretty.* “I am sorry.  I am not thinking straight.”

She laughs.  “You are definitely thinking bi.”

I groan.  “My dad would have cheered for that.”

“Hey, I need to go pee and you need to wake up.”

I grab her hand before she gets out of bed.  “You are an amazing friend.”

“Yea, I am.  Friend.  Okay, I need to go or you gotta explain the watersports issue to your boyfriend.” 

“Don’t make me laugh. My poor head.  I am gonna get some water. Oh hey, why did you mostly undress us?”

“I promise I didn’t take advantage I sleep nude and you were asking me to sex you up so I got you to that state and then waited for you to pass out.”

“I know you wouldn’t take advantage.  That makes sense.  Sleep well?”

She shakes her head. “Not a wink.  Love ya.”

“I love you too.”  Why does she sound so sad about that?  *Past me is a stupid bitch for making Jackie sad. Or is it present me?*

## What is Atlas Quantum?

Atlas Quantum is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies without needing to manually analyze charts or time the market themselves. It uses a combination of **AI algorithms** and **real-time market data** to execute trades based on preset parameters.

Think of it like putting your crypto trades on autopilot. You don’t need to be a Wall Street genius to get started. The platform’s goal is to make trading more accessible, especially for beginners who might be overwhelmed by all the jargon and volatility.

## Who Created Atlas Quantum?

Atlas Quantum was founded by a team of **developers and financial enthusiasts** who aimed to simplify crypto trading. While detailed public info about the exact founders is limited (a bit of a red flag in my book), the system has similarities to known platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, which also prioritize user-friendly automation.

The lack of transparency around the people behind the project might raise eyebrows, but that’s not uncommon in the crypto space. What matters more is how the platform performs—and from what I’ve tested and researched, it’s been fairly solid.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Atlas Quantum Today](https://is.gd/hl2pis)
## How Does Atlas Quantum Work?

The platform uses **AI-driven algorithms** to scan the market 24/7 for trading opportunities. These algorithms analyze massive amounts of data in real time—price trends, news events, volume spikes—and then execute trades automatically based on predefined settings.

Here’s a quick breakdown of how it flows:

- You set your **trading preferences** (risk level, investment amount, etc.)
- The bot monitors the market and **executes trades** when conditions match your settings
- You can watch it work in real time or just check your balance later

It’s basically like having a robot assistant who never sleeps and lives for crypto charts.

## Atlas Quantum Pros and Cons

Like any tool, Atlas Quantum has its strengths and weaknesses. Here’s a quick rundown:

**Pros:**
- ✅ Automated trading = hands-free experience
- ✅ User-friendly interface for beginners
- ✅ Real-time market scanning improves timing
- ✅ Multiple asset support (not just Bitcoin)
- ✅ Demo account to test before you invest real money

**Cons:**
- ❌ Lack of transparency about the developers
- ❌ Requires a $250 deposit to get started
- ❌ Not available in all countries
- ❌ Still needs monitoring—it's not totally “set and forget”

### [👉 Open Your Atlas Quantum Account Now](https://is.gd/hl2pis)
## What Devices Can be Used to Access Atlas Quantum?

One of the best things about Atlas Quantum is its **cross-platform support**. You can use it on:

- **Desktop** (Windows or Mac)
- **Smartphones** (iOS and Android)
- **Tablets**

Everything’s cloud-based, so you don’t need to download any heavy software. The mobile version is surprisingly smooth, which is great if you like checking your trades while you're out getting coffee or stuck in a meeting.

## Atlas Quantum – Supported Countries

Atlas Quantum is available in **most countries**, including the US, UK, Australia, and Canada. However, there are a few regions where access is restricted—usually due to local financial regulations.

If you’re unsure whether it works in your country, just try signing up. It’ll let you know right away if your region is supported.

Some countries where it may not be available:
- North Korea (obviously)
- Some parts of the Middle East
- A few EU countries due to regulatory concerns

## Atlas Quantum – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This is one of the platform’s strongest features. The bot constantly monitors crypto markets and uses AI to find **high-probability trades**. It reacts faster than any human could, which is crucial in the crypto world where prices can change in seconds.

### User-Friendly Interface

You don’t need to be a tech wizard to use Atlas Quantum. The dashboard is clean, and all the key features are just a click away. Even total newcomers can navigate it with ease.

### Mobile Accessibility

The mobile version is slick. It’s optimized for smaller screens and doesn’t lag or crash (at least in my experience). You can track performance, adjust settings, and even initiate withdrawals—all from your phone.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **custom alerts** for price movements, trade completions, or big market events. This helps you stay on top of things without being glued to your screen 24/7.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Atlas Quantum supports not just Bitcoin but also Ethereum, Litecoin, and a few other popular coins. This gives you a bit more **diversification**, which I always recommend in crypto.

## Is Atlas Quantum a Scam?

Short answer: **No**, it doesn’t appear to be a scam.

Longer answer: While the **lack of detailed founder info** is not ideal, the platform itself works as advertised. I deposited the minimum, ran a few test trades, and was able to withdraw my funds without issues. That said, always approach new platforms with **caution** and never invest money you can't afford to lose.

Also, look out for **fake mirror sites** pretending to be Atlas Quantum. Always check the URL and make sure you’re on the legit one.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Atlas Quantum?

The minimum deposit is **$250**, which is pretty standard for these kinds of platforms. It’s enough to get a feel for how the bot works without risking too much capital.

Keep in mind:
- You don’t pay for the software itself
- The deposit is your money to trade with
- You can withdraw it anytime (minus any losses, of course)

### Atlas Quantum Customer Support

Customer support is **available via live chat and email**, and I’ve had decent experiences with them. Response times vary (usually under 24 hours), and they’re friendly, though not always super detailed in their responses.

There’s also a **help center** with FAQs and guides, which is handy for common issues.

## How do you start trading on Atlas Quantum?

Getting started is super easy. You don’t need to download anything, and the setup only takes about 10 minutes.

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Atlas Quantum site and fill out the signup form. You’ll need:
- Full name

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding your account, you can either:
- Switch on **auto-trade** mode
- Or manually adjust settings if you want more control

If you’re not ready to risk real money, try the **demo mode** first.

## How to Delete an Atlas Quantum Account?

If you want to delete your account, just contact customer support via email or live chat and request an account closure. They’ll guide you through the process. Make sure to **withdraw any remaining balance** before closing.

Atlas Quantum is a **legit, user-friendly automated trading platform** that’s great for beginner and intermediate users. It’s not perfect—especially with limited founder transparency—but it delivers on its core promise: making crypto trading more accessible and less stressful.

## What is GPT +9.0 Lispro?

GPT +9.0 Lispro is basically an **AI-powered trading assistant** that uses predictive algorithms to analyze the market and help you make better trades. Think of it as having a super smart, always-on financial advisor that doesn’t need coffee breaks.

It uses a version of the GPT language model (yeah, the same tech behind ChatGPT) but with trading-focused capabilities. The platform combines real-time market data, machine learning, and automation to generate trade signals and even auto-execute trades if you want to go fully hands-off.

Unlike some platforms that just throw graphs at your face and expect you to figure it out, GPT +9.0 Lispro actually helps interpret that data in plain English. It’s designed to reduce the learning curve while still offering depth for those who want to get into the weeds.

## Who Created GPT +9.0 Lispro?

There’s not a ton of public info about the exact team, but from what I’ve found, GPT +9.0 Lispro was developed by a group of fintech experts, AI engineers, and former Wall Street analysts. These folks supposedly have experience working with both **OpenAI technologies** and financial trading systems.

That said, it’s pretty common for platforms in this space to keep things a bit vague for competitive reasons. While I’d like more transparency, the platform’s performance and user support kind of speak for themselves. It feels legit, and nothing about it throws up the usual scam red flags.

## How Does GPT +9.0 Lispro Work?

GPT +9.0 Lispro connects to financial markets and uses its AI engine to scan for patterns, trends, and trade opportunities in real-time. It pulls data from multiple sources—news feeds, stock tickers, social media sentiment, and more—and processes it using natural language AI and machine learning.

Here’s a simple breakdown of how it does its thing:

- **Collects live market data** across crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities.
- **Processes that data using GPT-based algorithms** to find trading signals.
- **Provides recommendations** or automatically places trades if you turn on auto-trading.
- **Learns from past trades**, adapting over time to improve accuracy.

It also lets you set parameters so you can keep control over risk levels, trade size, and what assets you want to target. You’re not just throwing money into the void.

## GPT +9.0 Lispro Pros and Cons

### Pros:

### Cons:

- **Limited Transparency**: Info about the team is sparse.
- **AI Isn’t Infallible**: It’s good, but not magic. You still need to manage risk.

This gives you a ton of flexibility to diversify your portfolio, all from one platform.

## Is GPT +9.0 Lispro a Scam?

You’ll need to deposit a minimum of **$250** to activate your trading account. This is pretty standard for platforms in this space (Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge have similar requirements). It’s not outrageous, but I’d love to see a lower barrier for beginners.

### GPT +9.0 Lispro Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested the chat feature and got a response in under two minutes, which is rare. The reps seemed knowledgeable and didn’t just copy-paste generic answers. Big points here.

*Tylen*

Very little lay between Eldan’s Hearth and Ildris, and Tylen walked mostly in silence, with birds and trees alone for company. The calm and tranquility of the forest did poorly as a distraction from his grief, however. Many times that first day, he broke down and sobbed, until he was unable to continue walking, and simply fell into a broken puddle on the trail. The first night, he brought out only his bedroll, and went uneasily to sleep.

A crash of thunder woke him, and the skies opened soon after, drenching him thoroughly. He had already been cold, and this drove him to violent shivers.

Mom. He just wanted to be home, and watching her make another sweater that she would sell for far too little to someone in town “because they really need it”. But he would never see her do that again, and no one would ever have another sweater of hers.

When the shivers grew so great he began to feel sleepy and warm, he knew he must either start a fire, or die. The realization did not galvanize him to action nearly as much as he expected. Moving anyways, he cast a tarp over a low pine tree branch, and got to work. With dull panic, he realized there was nothing at all to burn that was not wet. The ground muddied and more lightning split the sky, more rain fell.

Again he considered if he should die. It wasn’t so different from being curled up in the burnt husk of his home. As he sat under the tarp unmoving however, two things slowly pricked his mind. First, the tarp took the rain off him, and the cold began to hurt again, bringing with it quaking shivers. Second, his left forearm rested on his leg, and it hurt because something in his pocket jutted into it. The Crestguard emblem. He swallowed and pushed rain out of his eyes and grabbed his bag. He would try not dying at least for a little.

Reaching into his pack, he grew shocked upon seeing Marn had given him his fire Rune. Quickly assembling branches, sticks, and one stray log into a pile, he placed the square metal piece near the wood, and put his hands on it. Abruptly, his vision swam and he lost control of his limbs, thankfully falling to the side. As he faded from consciousness, he saw a few tiny flames begin to eat up the twigs, and then he was gone.

Pain woke him again, this time sharper. With a yelp, he frantically kicked away the burning tarp that lay against his legs. The rain had faded to a light sprinkling, and the fire had mostly gone out. It had seemed to do the trick though, especially with how close he had laid to it. He touched the side of his face and it felt rather raw and tender.

Looking up, the barest hint of dawn was in the sky, so he ruefully began packing up everything from the night before. By some miracle, he still had everything, although the tarp was much reduced in size. If luck was with him today though, he would reach Ildris and would not need to try a night in the woods again.

He wanted coffee, but after last night’s experience with the flame Rune, he did not feel enough like having coffee to risk that again. Instead, he ate some of the jerky Marn had packed him, and set off. Many hours later, as the sun began to think about slumber, Tylen started to see people and roads, and dirt turned to cobblestone. Ildris lay ahead.

The city first greeted him with ramshackle huts, side-eyeing beggars, tiny shops and still busy foot traffic at the outskirts. The forest intermingled with and begrudgingly gave way to stubborn human spirit, which crowded in the boughs and branches and teemed with anyone who thought pure proximity to Ildris would gain them wealth.

The second greeting was felt initially in his foot, shodstone paved the street, made by the mages and masons. He had never seen it in person before, and marveled at the thin grooves cut precisely into the granite. Here on the sides sat more permanent stalls for traveling merchant outfits and tinkers, many of which held lamps, lanterns, Rune lights, and more types of faces than his entire lifetime had imagined.

Third and most daunting, the city wall sat staunchly on ancient carved stone, merchant stalls and random houses right up against it along with the forest. Ildris had not needed to use its wall in a very long time, and both the forest and the people grew on it like a vine.

Tylen bumped and jostled his way in, more often than not because he did not watch where he went. As he crossed under the graceful spanning arch of the wall over the central road, he nearly stopped in wonder. That music. That wonderful, magical melodic softness danced around him.

He looked down at his feet, and beheld the Old Runes as they glowed and sang. Etched into the stone from a time when men understood Runic, they made sweet melody as people walked over them, and they glowed with a gentle hue that changed like wind.

    Someone decided to shove him, he gawked for so long. After that, he looked for some hint of where he might find the Barracks. He reached into his pocket, and held the Crestguard emblem. He choked back a sob. It wouldn’t do for them to see him teary-eyed, they would probably reject him.
    
    Before he saw any building that seemed likely to be for that purpose, a line of people in front of a tent with the Jarden warcrest on it caught his attention. Making his way closer, he saw an inscription posted clearly on an easel:

**Notice of Levy**

By order of the High Council of Jarda

All able-bodied citizens aged sixteen and greater may present themselves for voluntary enlistment in defense of the realm.

Service guarantees the rights and honors of the Warcrest. Lodging, training, and provisions provided during evaluation.

First muster begins the seventh day of November.

Peace is held by those willing to guard it.

He jumped in line at once, and began to rehearse what he would say, and how he would convince them. It surprised him that word of the raid had reached the High Council so quickly, and that they had responded so rapidly. The line moved quickly, and his anticipation mounted as he neared the front. And then suddenly it was over.  
  
“Name?”  
  
“Tylen.”  
  
“Last?”  
  
“Oh, um--”  
  
“Sixty-fourth, then.”  
  
“What?”  
  
“You are Tylen Sixty-fourth; respond to that name when called. Jump.”  
  
“Jump?”  
  
“Jump.”  
  
He did.  
  
The grizzled veteran who had not once looked up scratched something on a piece of paper, then ripped a sheet out and handed it to him, along with an arm band with the recruit patch sewn in. Tylen Sixty-fourth, 3rd Barracks, fifth bunk. Full Evaluation.  
  
“Report for the First Muster on the seventh, otherwise you will wait for the next Muster for Evaluation.”  
  
“Is…is that all?”  
  
The man just pointed away. “Next.”  
  
He walked away, feeling both disappointed and elated. Really, it was a good thing that part was easy. When training began, they would see. No soldier here could claim what he could. The grief suddenly suffocated him, and anger tinged the cloud of darkness. Haelstra had not attacked since before he was born, which made him the only recruit who had lost family to them.  
  
After aimlessly shambling around in the square for awhile, his thoughts gradually calmed, and he looked up and saw the Silver Handle. He had never been in a tavern. Well, he was a soldier now, or a recruit at least. Feeling emboldened, and also hoping perhaps to make a friend, he walked to the door and went in.  
  
  
  
He stood awkward and felt awkward as he stood. The bar was only a few feet away, and one should just walk up, was what he recalled from stories. That felt strangely imposing when considered, however. On the left, he saw two soldiers his age about to give out coin for the drinks they ordered. The shoulder band patch marked them as new, like him.  
  
Sacrifice for them first, without promise for return.  
  
“I’ve got that!” He stepped up quickly, and put out his own coin. The bartender raised an eyebrow, but took it when the other boy withdrew his payment.  
  
“Oi?” The recruit looked at him, and Tylen had the odd sense he’d done something wrong, but he couldn’t imagine what. He forged on.  
  
“I’m Tylen.” He extended his hand.  
  
“‘Ank you so, so much for ‘at. Really couldn’t ha’ done it myself, real thanks for ‘at.”  
  
“You’re…welcome, I… I just wanted to make a friend.”  
  
The recruit slouched back in his chair, and threw a glance at his friend, which Tylen did not like, though again he had no idea what exactly it meant.  
  
“Not many friends, ‘en?” He spoke with some accent Tylen had never heard until Ildris, making ‘friends’ sound like a long uncaring sigh.  
  
“Er, no not…really. Not any, yet.”  
  
At this, the youth laughed and hit his friend on the arm, who also laughed. Really, they seemed to find the whole thing far more outrageous than Tylen thought they had any right to.  
  
“But, I thought we could--”  
  
“Go piss in the Weave, man,” and he knocked his still outstretched hand aside. “An’ ‘ank ya for the drink.” He rolled his head around as he said it, which provoked them both to laughter again.   
  
Tylen felt his face burning, and became aware of others staring at him. There were too many faces he was suddenly seeing to really know what was thought of him but he hated the feeling.  
  
“Tylen, was it?”  
  
He turned at the new voice. A pepper-haired man with sharp green eyes pushed past him, and set a few coins on the bartop. The barkeep seemed to know what to get him, though he hadn’t said anything.  
  
“Yes…sir,” he answered, but noticed a recruit patch on the man’s shoulder too.  
  
“Call me Torp, kid. Here you go.” He pushed a tankard of something frothy into his hand, then tilted his head over toward a table. It had a cloak thrown over the back of a chair, which Torp sat down in, so it must have been his seat.  
  
Tylen sat down as well. “Thank you si--”  
  
His hand shot up, index finger out.  
  
“...Torp. I can pay for this.”  
  
“That did not seem to work for you.” He gave him a wry grin.  
  
“I…no, it didn’t. Did I do something wrong?”  
  
Torp sighed. “No, really you did everything right. But Baeumont is drunk, and you were honest. He thought you insulted his status; common knowledge around here that his father cut him off and forced him into the Barracks.”  
  
“Oh. I didn’t know that.”  
  
“I noticed.”  
  
There was no malice in the reply, but he didn’t know what to say in response to that, so he took his first large swig of the tankard. In all the stories he knew of men drinking, they drank a lot, and fast. When instead the froth and liquid was cold, strangely popping against his tongue, and ran down his throat like a smouldering bramble, it was all he could do not to spit it out on the spot.  
  
Torp snorted. “You get used to it.”  
  
Tylen doubted that. However, since he had been gifted this strange drink, he figured it polite and as close to sacrifice as he could get to finish it, so he took another swallow before he remembered something he was curious about.  
  
“Torp?”  
  
“Good memory.”  
  
“Er. Why do you have a recruit patch?”  
  
He nodded sagely. “It is likely because I am a recruit.”  
  
A small laugh tried to burble out of him, stopped only by the pang of sadness, when he recalled the last person who had joked with him like that. All that made it to the surface was a slight grin. He took another swig, and wondered why the room had begun to grow so warm.  
  
“You are old,” he stated, returning a sagely nod, “so I’m wondering why you are a recruit.”	

He looked at first as if he would be offended, but instead barked a laugh which sounded like he had discovered some new marvel. “That is a long story, I will tell it sometime. But for now I will say: Tylen, I would like to be your friend,” and he held out his hand.

Tylen smiled, and a little glow lit deep inside him, despite the vast despair that lived there too. Shaking his hand, he took another pull from the drink, and noted with surprise he nearly enjoyed the sip.

“Why do you want to be my friend?” Tylen asked, feeling rather bold.

“Call it intuition. Happiness not all the youth are stuck up, pampered brats who wish to play soldier. And I want to see you live longer than today.”

“They would have killed me?”  
  
Torp rolled his eyes. “Relax, kid. Thrive. I want to see you thrive. You seem rather new, and I would wager you grew up in a town of less than a hundred people up north.”  
  
Tylen’s jaw dropped. “You can just see that? Can everyone see that?”  
  
Torp laughed, and Tylen found he thought it a bit funny too. A bit dizzy as well.  
  
“Oh, they can see it. See that you won’t notice them take your bag off you either,” and he looked specifically at the strap Tylen wore across his chest.  
  
With horror, he noticed it had been cut, and his bag was no longer with him.  
  
He lept up with a cry, splashing beer on the table and nearly falling. No, not the bag. Not his sword, not the gift from Elara. Did…did Torp help them do this? He stared at him in sudden suspicion.

Torp held his hand up and forestalled the outpouring. “We will get it back. You needed a hard lesson in trust, and I don’t need another scene in this bar. Follow me.”",1,1745031064.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

## A Deeper Dive into sennheiser Momentum 4 Reviews

The Sennheiser Momentum⁣ 4 wireless review cycle was initially filled with praise, highlighting their extraordinary audio performance and adaptive noise cancellation. ⁣Autonomous tests consistently lauded the headphones' ability to deliver a balanced and detailed‍ sound signature,pleasing both audiophiles seeking⁤ nuanced audio and ‍casual listeners looking ⁣for an enjoyable listening experience. Though, as ‌newer models have emerged, a more critical perspective has started to form. let’s break down the key aspects of the Sennheiser ‌Momentum 4, examining their strengths and weaknesses to provide a complete overview.

###⁢ Sound Quality: Still‌ a Benchmark?

For many, the foundation of any premium headphone experience is sound quality. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 sound quality‌ quickly became a talking point⁢ upon release, and for good reason. Sennheiser ​has a ⁣long-standing reputation for delivering⁢ exceptional audio, and the ⁢Momentum 4 largely lives up to that legacy to this day. The headphones offer a wide soundstage, allowing you to discern individual instruments and sonic details ⁢with ⁢clarity. The bass response is rich and present without being overpowering, the​ mids are clear and ⁣well-defined, and ⁤the highs are crisp and sparkling. Whether you're listening to classical music, podcasts, or heavy metal, the Momentum 4 provides a ‌balanced and engaging ‌listening experience. Several Sennheiser headphones review articles consistently place ⁣the Momentum 4 among the top performers in their class for sound fidelity.

however, some competing⁣ models have⁤ begun to eclipse ​the ⁢Momentum 4 in particular areas. Certain newer headphones now offer slightly wider soundstages or more⁢ customizable EQ settings, potentially offering an edge for very specific sonic preferences. Still, most listeners will be more than satisfied‍ with‍ the Sennheiser Momentum 4.

### Noise Cancellation: Blocking Out the⁣ World

Effective noise cancellation is a crucial ⁢feature for many headphone users, especially those who travel frequently, work in noisy environments, or simply want to immerse‍ themselves in their music. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 ‌noise cancelling review results have generally⁤ been positive, showcasing its effectiveness at reducing ambient sounds. The ‍adaptive noise⁣ cancellation feature automatically adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, ensuring optimal performance in various environments.⁢ Whether you're on a crowded train, in a ​bustling⁤ coffee shop, ⁢or on a noisy airplane, the Momentum 4 can significantly reduce distractions and allow you to focus⁣ on ⁤what matters most.

That said,‌ the landscape of noise-canceling technology has advanced since the Momentum 4's initial release. While still very good, some‍ newer models boast improved algorithms and more​ powerful⁤ processors that allow them to more effectively block out higher-frequency sounds. For those who‍ prioritize absolute silence above all​ else, particularly⁤ in extremely noisy environments,⁢ exploring these newer alternatives might potentially ‌be worthwhile. ​However,for the vast majority of users,the Sennheiser Momentum 4 provides excellent noise cancellation that's suited for everyday use.

### Comfort and Design: Long-Lasting Wearability

Comfort is king when ‍it‌ comes to over-ear headphones,especially for extended listening sessions. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 comfort levels have been a⁢ point of discussion amongst ‌users. The headphones feature plush earcups and a lightweight design, making⁣ them​ pleasant to wear for hours on end.The headband is also well-padded ⁢and⁤ distributes weight⁤ evenly, ​preventing pressure ​points and ensuring a secure and comfortable fit.

The design of the Momentum 4 is modern and understated, with a sleek matte finish and‌ minimalist aesthetic.Some users initially missed the⁢ folding design of previous Momentum models,⁣ finding the case larger to accommodate the swiveling earcups.Though,the swivel design does contribute to a more comfortable fit​ for many. Ultimately, the comfort and design of the Momentum 4‌ strike a good balance between ‌aesthetics and ⁤ergonomics, making them suitable ‍for both casual listening and professional use. The Sennheiser ​Momentum 4 pros and cons regularly mention​ comfort in a positive ‌light, solidifying its place as a comfortable noise-canceling⁣ headphone.

### Battery Life: Powering Your​ Day

Long battery life is essential for wireless headphones, allowing you to enjoy​ your music without constantly worrying⁤ about running out of ⁢power. The Momentum 4 battery life review results have consistently praised⁣ its impressive battery performance, offering up to 60 hours of‌ listening time on a single charge. Even ⁢with noise cancellation enabled,​ you‌ can expect to get a solid 40-50 hours of playtime. The headphones also support fast charging, providing several hours of listening​ time after just a few ⁢minutes of charging.This long battery life makes the Momentum 4 ideal for ⁢travel, long commutes, or extended work sessions. You can confidently use them throughout the day without needing to recharge,ensuring uninterrupted enjoyment of your audio content. It's important to note that battery life can vary depending on usage habits, ‍such as volume levels and the use of noise cancellation, but the Momentum ⁣4 generally⁢ delivers excellent battery performance.

### Considering the Competition: Sennheiser ⁣Momentum 4‌ Vs

The Sennheiser ⁤Momentum ⁣4 doesn't exist in a vacuum. Many other excellent headphones are vying for ⁤your attention and your hard-earned money. A Sennheiser Momentum 4 vs‍ comparison ‍against other models is essential to determine if these ‌headphones​ are the right fit for your needs. Let's consider a few key ⁢competitors:

*   **Sony WH-1000XM5:** ‌These headphones are frequently enough seen as the Momentum 4's primary rival. They offer slightly better noise cancellation in some situations and a ‌more customizable sound profile. However,the Momentum 4 often wins out in terms of sound quality clarity and a more balanced frequency response.

*   **Bose QuietComfort 45/ultra:** Bose is‌ renowned for its noise cancellation, and the QC45 and newer Ultra⁢ models offer top-tier performance in this⁢ area. Though, many reviewers find the Momentum 4⁤ to offer superior ‍sound quality compared to Bose's​ signature sound.

*   **Apple AirPods Max:** These headphones boast seamless integration with Apple devices and excellent build quality. however, their⁢ high ‌price point and limited compatibility with non-Apple devices make​ them⁤ a less versatile option than the Momentum 4 for many users.

When making your decision, carefully consider your priorities. If noise cancellation is paramount, the Sony or bose options might be slightly better. Though,if sound quality is your primary concern,the sennheiser Momentum 4 remains an excellent choice.

### Pricing and Value: Are They Still ⁣Worth the Investment?

The‍ Sennheiser Momentum 4 price has fluctuated‍ as its release. As newer models ⁢have entered the market, you may find deals on the Momentum 4, making them an even more attractive⁤ option.

In the beginning of the relationship we were definitely in our “honey moon phase” and talked 24/7. This time in our relationship was so fun and everything and I felt so close to him. At this time, we both shared our location with each other just to see what the other did throughout the day. I was fine with it- up until recently. He used to not mention anything about it and neither did I. Occasionally he would say something like “Are you at chick fil a? I wish i could go,” and I would laugh about it. At the time I didn’t really care about it and just kind of blew it off. I’ve never really checked his location and I still don’t, but it feels as though recently he’s been checking mine routinely. I asked him how often he checks it and he said he checks it every time he responds to me because it’s “right there”. Obviously it’s hard to have trust in a long distance relationship, but I don’t know if I can stand it anymore. He regularly texts me something about where I am, and even asks me what i’m doing at places. After school I went to a coffee shop and he was texting me why I went there instead of going home. I love him so much but it’s kind of getting annoying. If I don’t respond in a certain matter of time he will say something along the lines of “I see your at home why aren’t you messaging me back?” Whenever I confront him about it he always say it’s a joke and he doesn’t actually care, but I feel like he’s just saying that so I don’t get mad. I am not doing anything suspicious and the only time I’m out is if I am getting food or at school/gym. I would understand if I was always at some random persons house but I literally don’t hangout with anyone. On the one day I do hangout with someone and don’t have time to respond to him, he’ll message “hope you’re having fun with (friend’s name).” The reason why I’m asking for help on what to say is because I’m afraid he’ll think it’s because I want to cheat or something. I have a feeling he’s going to be like “why do you want to stop sharing your location?

Due the quantity of work, she cut a lot of corners which we are paying for now. Due to all the fixing, there is more backlog that myself and my junior have been struggling to get on top of. We'd been offered another part-time resource from the contractor that the junior works for and the deal was nearly signed and sealed. Then last week, my lead went to another manager to see about getting budget for an extra person on our books. He then told me that this manager had budget and suggested they try and get back the person who was doing the job before me. 
This had knocked me for a six. I know this woman was really popular and the guys keep referring to me as ""the new Betty"" (not her real name lol). One guy, who was very close to her, met her for coffee one day and came back with brownies she made. He told everyone that Betty had sent brownies up for us to eat and then said to me ""except yours. Yours is poisoned"". With that buried in my emotional trigger files, I'm really worried about how I'll deal with this person. My boss told me she very confident and mouthy and ""will tell you how it is"". I am not good with dealing with people like that. My brain is too slow to respond in these situations. And I'm honestly really concerned. And whilst I am the senior and she'll answer to me, that means nothing when all the guys like her so much. I can't compete with that. My adhd inhibits me socially and I can seem weird to people. I'm not cool, I'm a worker bee. From what I know of her, she's a Queen Bee. I've never learned how to stand behind my knowledge.

1k2m8ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancun/comments/1k2m8ct/review_royal_sands/,Review: Royal Sands,"Just got back from a 5 day trip. If you have teenagers, this is the place for you! We traveled with our 16 year old son and 14 year old daughter. They are too old to share a bed anymore, and husband and I really wanted our own space too. However, we were having a hard time finding a nice resort that had more than two beds in a room within our price range (under 4500K for AI), until we found Royal Sands. We stayed in a one-bedroom ocean view suite. The bedroom had a king, and the living room had two Murphy beds that pulled down from the entertainment center. Perfect for us! It also had a *humongous* balcony overlooking the pool and ocean (not completely ocean-facing and we were fine with that) that we spent a lot of time on. The kitchen area was very well stocked…honestly, I could have cooked full meals there without an issue. Full fridge, oven, stove, coffeemaker, dishes, plates, glassware, you name it, they had it. Fridge was stocked with water, soda, and beer on arrival, and replenished every day. 

The property also has a full-on grocery store that has pretty much everything you could possibly want. Snacks, alcohol, dairy, coffee, suntan lotion, water shoes, and even a small farmacia. 

Very large pool with shallow, cordoned-off area for small kids. There is also another “quiet” pool for adults. Both pools have swim-up bars. Drink service at the pool was very attentive. Slightly less so on the beach, but we still didn’t have to wait too long until someone came around.

Beach was spectacular. Water was that gorgeous Caribbean blue. Loads of palapas (the huts with straw roofs) with loungers underneath. One thing that I liked was that we were able to find four loungers together at both the beach and the pool even without going down early to stake out a spot. On two of the days we were there, we found an open palapa even around noon. The resort has a system where you can reserve your loungers with little flags they give you with your room number on it. If you put your flags down early and then disappear for more than a couple of hours, they will pick up your flags. I think this was a good system and allowed people who don’t get up at 5 AM a chance at spots at the pool and beach. We never had too much trouble finding spots no matter the time of day. This was a refreshing change from Moon Palace, where staking out your spot is like Thunderdome. 

There is also a playground and a small water park with a couple of waterslides for kids, but we didn’t do those. My teenagers apparently think they’re too cool for waterslides now 🤣 and the area was geared for younger kids, with a splash pad and dumpy bucket, etc. 

The food was decent for all-inclusive. Better than at Moon Palace, where we stayed in January 2024. There’s a buffet, a Japanese place, a sports bar (my son was in heaven there), an upscale place called Club Bistro, and a Mexican place called Hacienda Sisal that had a dinner show. We did not do the Mexican place because we ran out of time, and we could never get into Club Bistro, even with the help of the concierge. You can only make day-of reservations if you’re not a timeshare member, and we found that most of the reservations were taken by members almost every day. Kind of a bummer but 🤷‍♀️. The buffet was fine for breakfast. For dinner it’s a menu and not a buffet, and we found that the menu items were actually pretty good. We ate there for dinner twice. 

There are some activities on site, but not that many. Mainly things like yoga, beach volleyball, and water aerobics. However,  Thomas More Travel has an office there with very kind of excursion you could imagine. We booked parasailing with them and it was handled very well. We booked some other excursions separately, before we got there. We also booked airport transportation with Thomas More and it went great. 

Nightlife … there isn’t much. If you want to party at night, you’ll definitely need to go off-property. This was fine by us since we had the kids there. 16 wished there was something a little more at night for teenagers, but he didn’t find it to be a dealbreaker, and we got by at night with movies and card games. 

Cons: you need your room key to pay for basically everything. At meals, they will take it from you and give it back to you when you’re done. You can’t just use your room number like at other resorts. Makes it more than sketchy if you lose your room key … you definitely have to call to cancel that key and get a replacement right away. Also, the beds are pretty hard. If you like stiff mattresses then no problem, but if you don’t, it takes some getting used to. 

We paid about 4500 for 5 days and I definitely feel like we got our money’s worth. It was about 800 dollars more than its sister resort, the Royal Cancun Suites, but you get *so much more* bang for your buck. 

TL;DR; if you have kids and want to show them a fantastic time in Cancun in a great room at a reasonable price, this is your place. Would also recommend for older adults with no kids. Happy to answer questions in the comments! ",5,1745030174.0,cancun,1,1.0,False

So this one requires a bit of a back story.  I had this friend ""Emma"" (32F). We met in university and were very close. Over the years we moved away from each other and in my (32F) mind we were still good. Talking most days via text, she would be the first person I would go to about anything in my life. It wasn't perfect but she was more than a best friend to me, she was my sister. Chosen family. 

Well the last few years we drifted apart. At this point we had been friends for 13 years so I assumed it was just life happening but we would figure it out eventually, get back to our normal stride. Anyways, about 1 year ago, we finally talked on the phone and aired everything out. She had brought up issues from 5+ years ago that I had no idea were issues to her. I was willing to try and work through it but she need separation & said she was done. 

Fast forward to now. It's been almost a year during that convo and I still miss our friendship. There are things that pop up in my life that I want to send her. Recently went on a trip to our old university (for work) and I just spent the evening crying because I wanted to call her. Now I am going to go to the city she lives in (it is quite a distance from where I live, 6+ hour drive) for an unrelated reason to her but I am thinking about reaching out to see if she wants to grab a coffee or something to catch up. 

Should I reach out? I haven't heard from her all this time so do I bother? It's her birthday soon (June) so I was thinking of reaching out with a short birthday wish and mentioning it. 

I am not sure what I should do and could use some advice. ",1,1745030010.0,FriendshipAdvice,1,1.0,False

It’s an adaptation of the sauce I’ve used to make sticky rice, and I didn’t have fresh mangoes available today. But this sauce was a hit. It could be used on ice cream, french toast, or an alternative to mango sticky rice. 

The base sticky rice sauce I’ve used is 
1 can of coconut cream, 
1/4-1/3 cup of sugar (you may want use closer to 1/4c),
and 1/2tsp salt. 
Medium heat in a pot, melt and dissolve together. 

To this, I’ve added:
-1 packet of instant coffee.
-Cinnamon (to taste)

Turn the heat to low and stir while adding:
-1/4c chocolate
-4tbsp peanut butter powder (PB2)
Keep stirring. 

If you are making sticky rice, add half the mixture to your rice before proceeding. 

Cornstarch slurry: 
Dissolve cornstarch into water at a 1:3 ratio. If you’ve already used half the sauce in the last step, use 1/2tsp corn starch. Else use a teaspoon. 
Mix the slurry into the sauce and stir until desired consistency. 

This would be good with bananas or strawberries.

“Heather pushed her team too far in the cook-off challenge and ended up one chilly mama. Owen had a hard day. Vito led the Killer Bass to victory. And after he let his appetite get to him, it was buh-bye, Owen.”

“Will the Gophers ever be able to come back from behind? And just how much trust do they have in one another? Find out this week on Total! Drama! Island!""

(Theme Song)

A close-up of an empty meal tray opened the episode, and Chef's arm was shown dropping a scoop of a pale orange something with the consistency of mashed potatoes onto it. ""Today's breakfast,"" Chef announced as he stuck a straw into the pile, ""is French-Italian fusion casserole!""

The camera pulled back to show Cody taking the tray. ""You mean leftovers from the cooking challenge?” he said.

""Yeah, that's right!"" Chef shouted. ""You got a problem with that?!""

""Sir, no sir!"" Cody saluted the cook, and he saluted back at him.

Cody then headed to the Gophers' table, where Heather was feeling sick due to being locked up in a freezer. She had a blanket wrapped around her, and was shaking and sneezing.

""You're more chilly than usual,"" Cody quipped as he sat down.

""You're so funny,"" Heather said dryly. ""You all think that you can just lock me up in a freezer and get away with it? I am gonna make you sorry that you ever met me.”

""I already am,"" Cody said smugly.

""You are such a... a... a... achoo!"" Heather spat out her sneeze. ""Ugh! I hate this place!”

Over at the Bass table, Ella chewed some of her breakfast and spit it in her pet rabbit's mouth, and Ezekiel looked at her funny.

Meanwhile, Duncan was getting himself a mug of coffee and placed it on his tray. He looked around before stuffing another mug under his shirt. He began walking away, only to come face-to-face with Sadie.

""I saw that,"" Sadie said. ""Why would you steal a mug?""

""'Cause it's cool looking and I don't have one. Didn't have one, that is,"" Duncan said.

""And you aren't worried about getting kicked off?"" Sadie questioned.

""We've been kicking the Gophers’ butts for a long time,"" Duncan chuckled as he walked away. “There's nothing to worry about.”

Sadie let out a sigh before going to sit down.

“I can't believe that Duncan, of all people, is the person I've talked to the most after Katie,” Sadie mentioned. “Even though I don't hate his guts, I'm not exactly calling him a friend too.”

So the producers and I thought that the best way to work through the group friction would be… to exploit it for laughs!"" he changed his frown into a grin. ""This is gonna be awesome!""

""Here's your belay and harness!"" Chris threw the equipment. Cody was about to catch them, but Heather stepped in front of him and did the deed for him.

“What's your problem?” Cody huffed.

""If you think I'm letting you hold me up, you're nuts!"" Heather told him.

""You won't be holding him up exactly,"" Chris interjected. ""One camper pulls the slack through the belay as their partner climbs,"" he explained. ""If the climber falls, the belay will stop them from crashing."" He demonstrated by pulling the rope through the belay and throwing the slack to Duncan, who was shown pulling it.

""The catch?"" Chris continued. ""Both the side and the base of the mountain are rigged with a few minor distractions like rusty nails, slippery oil slicks, mild explosives, and a few other surprises.""

""Wicked,"" Harold said in excitement.

""The person on belay must also harness their partner up,"" Chris said as Ella and Duncan gave each other a nod while Heather and Cody simply glared at each other. ""It's all about trust, people, and, remember, never let go of the rope! Your partner's life depends on it!""

""If that is the case,"" Cody said, ""I want a new partner.""

""Please,"" Heather disregarded. ""As much as I “love” your company, I'm not gonna throw a challenge just to kill you. Yet. Now spread 'em.""

""I've never tried this before,"" Ella said as Duncan began to secure her. ""Have you?""

“Oh yeah,” Duncan said. “They teach you how to climb walls in prison all the time.”

Ella's rabbit then popped out from behind Ella. ""I'm sorry, Cinder,"" she said. ""You can't come up with me. You can trust Mike though. Mike.” She gave her rabbit to the comedian. “Can you hold Cinder for now?""

""Okay,"" Mike agreed and looked down at the rabbit. ""She is pretty adorable.""

""There. You're all hooked up,"" Heather finished strapping the climbing gear on Cody.

Cody noticed another rope on him. ""What's the second rope for?"" the geek grew curious.

""It's a backup line,"" Heather explained.

""What are you smiling about?"" Cody asked suspiciously.

""Nothing. I'm just really happy we got on this challenge together,"" Heather sweetly said.

""It's all his fault for messing with me,"" Heather began her confessional vengefully. ""I have got a doctorate in revenge and humiliation.”

The footage cut back to a close-up of a patch of nails just as Ella grabbed on to a ledge between them. The viewpoint shifted to show Ella and Cody slowly making their way up the cliff, Cody in a slight lead.

Suddenly, an explosion detonated above the climbing campers, and another explosion occurred in front of Cody, sending the boy flying backwards.

The camera cut to Heather, who immediately pulled the rope and stopped her partner from falling. ""It's okay, I've got you!"" she called out.

""I promised surprises!"" Chris said as he showed a large water gun. ""Habañero pepper sauce, anyone?""

The host fired out red sauce, and Heather was the first to get hit by it. ""What the heck, Chris?!"" Heather cried out, letting go of the rope to wipe off the sauce from her face, accidentally plummeting Cody back down to the ground.

""Muy caliente!"" Chris said with a flashing smile. He shot another stream at Duncan, but the camper wore sunglasses to shield his eyes from the sauce and even drank some in the process.

“Is that the best you can do?” Duncan told Chris.

Chris frowned at the camera. ""Is that the best we can do?"" he said in a whisper.

Cody was quickly catching up to his opponent. He got around each of the obstacles and passed Ella.

""Come one, Cody,"" Heather called out. ""You don't want to fall behind."" The queen bee pulled the second rope, which ripped Cody's pants off, exposing his white underwear with yellow polka dots for everyone to see.

Cody yelped, and his ripped pants fell onto Ella's face.

""You hate to see that happen,"" Duncan said with a wince.

""So true, my man,"" Chris said, also wincing. ""So true.""

Ella removed the ripped pants from her face, and to her embarrassment, is staring at Cody's underwear. This caused her to lose her grip and scream all the way down.

Duncan yelped, having been pulled up by the rope, and he and Ella were now both hanging upside down together. ""This sucks,"" the punk groaned.

""How devastating,"" Ella agreed.

""Forget it,"" Cody held his pants with his teeth and resumed climbing, and he made it to the top of the cliff without any more issues.

""Looks like the Gophers have won the first challenge!"" Chris announced.

""Woo!"" Cody cheered in victory.

A pair of lights came on in the Mess Hall, illuminating a podium standing between the two tables. A third spotlight came on in the center, and the opposing pairs rose into either side as if they were being raised mechanically: Brick and Lindsay for the Gophers, then Ezekiel and Mike for the Bass. An unnamed white male somersaulted through the air and landed behind the podium. Seconds after the landing, Chris popped up from behind it as though he had done the stunt himself. He crossed his arms and grinned at the camera.

""And now round two!"" Chris announced. ""The Extreme! Cooking! Chal-lenge!"" The unnamed man crawled out in the background, heading into the kitchen as the four teens watched. ""Each team must choose who cooks and who eats.""

""You were Head Chef last time eh,"" Ezekiel said to Mike. ""I'll cook.""

“Okay, and can I borrow your hat for a while?” Mike asked the homeschooler.

“Why?” Ezekiel wondered.

“I know you don't like him, but we might need him for this part of the challenge,” Mike answered.

“Fine,” Ezekiel allowed, and Mike removed his toque and placed it on his head, gasping into Manitoba Smith.

“If what you're cooking is deadly, I won't eat it,” Manitoba told Ezekiel. “You got that?”

""Ooh, Brock! I'll be the cook!"" Lindsay said to Brick.

""I'm not experienced in cooking, so have at it,"" Brick agreed.

""Today you'll be preparing fugu sashimi,"" Chris announced, ""the traditional Japanese poisonous blowfish."" Chef wheeled a cart into the scene, on top of which sat a tank with two trembling and wide-eyed blowfish inside.

A gong sounded, rattling Lindsay and Brick before a short Japanese tune played in the background. A rough diagram of where to cut the fish was projected onto the wall next to the host, who picked up a pointer to assist in his explanation. ""The fugu blowfish contains enough lethal toxin to kill thirty people,"" Chris said. Chef tapped the side of the tank with a fish scoop, causing the two blowfish to puff up.

""Fishies,"" Chef said, picking up the fish by their tails, ""meet your maker!"" He tossed them onto the cutting boards on the tables in front of Brick and Manitoba, who looked at them warily.

""They must be sliced very carefully,"" Chris told them, ""to cut around the poisonous organs."" Lindsay poked the fish with a knife, and Manitoba looked suspicious. ""The poison paralyzes the nerves, and,"" Chris grinned darkly in a close-up, ""there is no antidote!"" His tone became lighter as he finished, ""So no worries!""

Brick took a worried peek at Lindsay. ""You have taken biology, right?""

Lindsay answered with a nod.

“Begin!” Chris announced.

Lindsay jabbed the fish with her knife, causing it to rapidly deflate and fly around the room. The two watched as it shot through a window and shattered it.

A stack of sashimi rolls on a plate was shown, and Ezekiel placed a sprig of parsley on top. ""Finished!"" he said.

From across the room, Lindsay had made a pile of pink mush and put a smiley face on it with ketchup.

Ezekiel pushed the plate over to Manitoba, who picked up a piece and inspected it. Chris and Chef were shown watching with anticipation as the Australian personality slowly put the piece of fish into his mouth, chewed it, and swallowed. He looked around and grinned, giving a thumbs up.

Chris and Chef looked over at the other team as Lindsay shoved her plate in front of Brick. ""Ta-da!"" she said.

The camera focused on the vague lump of fish on the plate. Brick stabbed a piece with his fork and stuck it into his mouth in order to chew through it.

Brick was silent at first... until he suddenly started slapping his head and screamed. The cadet chuckled, but soon his stomach started gurgling and he fell to the floor, his skin turning blue.

""You said you passed biology!"" Brick said in a slurred voice as he had his hand on the table.

""I said I took biology,"" Lindsay reaffirmed. Brick fell again and was now lying on the floor, twitching and vomiting about, the vomit starting to spread. “Eww!” Lindsay complained.

""It's cool,"" Chris told the teens as Ezekiel and Manitoba came over to see. ""Give him twenty-four hours and he'll be up walking and breathing good as new.""

""Is anyone gonna help this fella?"" Manitoba asked in bewilderment. Brick was shown in the midst of another spasm as Chef – dressed in a nurse's uniform – leaned in to give him mouth-to-mouth. He gurgled in horrified disgust as the scene faded to black.

(Commercial Break)

The sun was shown high in the sky before the camera panned down and out. Mike and Ezekiel were running across the docks together, smiles on their faces.

""Last one in's a rotten egg!"" Ezekiel said, taking the lead and flinging himself into the lake.

""Wait, I just have to make sure Cinder's safe!"" Mike put her on a lifeguard chair. He then jumped into the lake, and he surfaced next to Ezekiel.

""I was surprised that you managed to eat that fish, eh,"" Ezekiel said to Mike.

""It was Manitoba technically, but even if it wasn't him, I would still trust you,"" Mike told the prairie boy before swimming off laughing, and Ezekiel gave chase.

Brick was shown lying on a bed next to some medical equipment, still clearly afflicted by the blowfish he'd eaten. A small puddle of vomit had already formed under his head, and he was making alarmed gurgling noises. Chef, in his nurse's uniform, smirked as he looked between his and a large needle filled with a purple liquid. ""This won't hurt a bit,"" he told him with a tap of the needle before a malicious smirk formed on his face. ""It'll hurt a whole lot.""

Meanwhile, Ezekiel and Mike had just come out of the water and were drying themselves off when Mike noticed a snake that had slithered to where Cinder was and gasped.

""Get away from that rabbit!"" Ezekiel ran to save Cinder, but the snake swallowed her. The homeschooled boy tried to grab the snake, but an eagle swooped down and carried it off.

“Grab the eagle!” Mike pointed at the animal who had just landed at the end of the dock.

“You don't have to tell me twice,” Ezekiel rushed forward, but a shark rose up and ate the eagle, snake, and Cinder.

Mike inhaled into Chester. ""Stupid animals!” he stomped his foot in frustration.

""Good news!"" Chris announced as the camera showed the remaining members of both teams lined up before the host. ""The third round involves three more challenges! It's the Three Blind Challenges!"" He held up three fingers. ""It begins with the Blind William Tell, followed by the Blind Trapeze, and culminating in the treacherous Blind Toboggan.""

""Mike, where's Cinder?"" Ella whispered to Mike.

""Cinder? Uh, I'll go get her now,"" Mike darted away.

Chris then gave Ezekiel a pair of shades similar to what was used during the paintball challenge, then placed an arrow on top of the boy's head. ""Like legendary marksman William Tell,"" Chris explained as he went to stand by a barrel of apples some distance away, ""you'll be knocking arrows off your partner's head with crab apples.""

""Actually,"" Ezekiel corrected, ""it’s the other way around, ya knob.""

""Shush!"" Chris interrupted. ""Also,"" he showed them a white cloth, ""the shooter will be blindfolded! The person who knocks off the arrow,"" the blindfolded host explained, readying a slingshot, ""wins."" Chris let loose the apple, which hit Ezekiel in the crotch. He fell to his knees and groaned.

""Ahh, nuts!"" Chris said, peeking out from his blindfold. ""Sky and Dawn, you'll be one team,"" he said as the two Gophers smiled at each other, ""Harold and Shawn, you'll be the other.""

“I'm violently allergic to apples,” Harold said.

“Ooh, let me shoot! I'm a good shot!” Sadie offered.

Shawn sighed. “I hope so.”

""Okay!"" Chris said. ""Let's rock and roll!""

The scene cut to Dawn and Shawn with safety glasses and arrows on their heads. Across the clearing stood Sky and Sadie, already blindfolded, while Chris and the other campers stood to the side. Both shooters shot their first apples, and it hit their teammates’ chests. The shooters made their second shots, and once again, their partners got hit in the chest.

Several more apples were shown hitting the two targets, and while Dawn braved through them all, Shawn was shown to be wincing at every shot.

Eventually, Sky let one more apple fly, and it went straight onto the arrow, making it fall off Dawn’s head. “Nice job,” the moonchild congratulated the athlete.

Sky took a peek out of her blindfold. “Yes! I hit the arrow!” she cheered.

“I’ve got him this time,” Sadie steeled herself as she prepared to shoot another arrow.

“Sky won already!"" Chris yelled.

""Sadie, you can stop-!"" Shawn attempted to halt her only to get hit in the groin and forehead hard.

Chris stood in front of Sadie and held her shoulders. “Sadie, it’s over, man! Let it go!” the host cried out as he shook her to her senses.

Sadie took off her blindfold. “Oopsie. Sorry,” she apologized to Shawn, who was too unconscious to speak before falling down.

The next part of the challenge had the host and campers, without Shawn, assembled behind a tall wooden structure suspended over a pool of water. Going up the two front posts were rungs that could be used to climb to a small platform, and hanging over the gap in the middle were two trapezes.

""And now,"" Chris announced, ""the Blind Trapeze! To avoid serious injury, the trapeze has been set up over this pond, which is full of jellyfish!"" A school of pinkish-purple jellyfish crackling with electricity was shown, and the Killer Bass gasped.

""You two,"" Chris said as he tossed blindfolds to Ezekiel and Heather, ""will stand blindfolded on the platform until your partners tell you when to jump."" The two looked at their assigned partners Harold and Lindsay.

""And then?"" Heather asked.

""Then hopefully they'll catch you,"" Chris told her. ""Or that's gonna be one heck of a painful swim. Okay, hut hut!""

Ella walked up to Mike. ""So, do you have Cinder?"" she asked.

""Uh... I… I put her in the... And then there were..."" Mike stammered and Ella started to tear up. ""I'm not sure where she is. Sorry.""

""It's not your fault. I just want to be alone for the time being,” Ella told him and distanced herself from her team.

Mike frowned with guilt, and Duncan saw this and walked off.

The scene skipped ahead to show the two blindfolded contestants and jumpers at their stations, Harold hanging from his knees from the Bass' trapeze, and Lindsay next to her teammate on the Gophers' platform.

""Okay, Ezekiel! Jump now!"" Harold said while swinging, but Ezekiel stood still out of fear. ""If we're going to win, you've got to trust me!""

""Okay! Next time!"" Ezekiel said.

""Okay. One..."" Harold called out slowly. ""Two...three!"" Ezekiel gulped but took the leap, and his partner caught him easily. As the two swung over the pond, the Bass cheered.

""Okay Gophers, your turn!"" Chris continued with a smile.

Lindsay was now on the Bass’ trapeze. ""Okay!"" she called as she swung back and forth. ""One! Two! Three! Jump! No, oh, no, not yet!""

But Heather leaped off the platform, and she missed catching Lindsay. The queen bee plunged into the pond, sending up a wave of water and jellyfish. Her screams and the sound of stinging filled the air as her team looked on in concern.

Confessional: Cody

""Those jellyfish have to sting pretty badly,"" Cody confessed uncomfortably.

Confessional Ends

The footage cut back to the infirmary. A scream followed by the sound of an electric shock was heard as Heather entered the tent, a jellyfish still clinging to her. ""I can't believe I trusted that little-” she got zapped mid-sentence. “Freaking stinging jellyfish!”

Heather took a seat on one of the beds, and noticed Shawn waking up. “Where am I?” he observed his surroundings.

“You're in the infirmary,” Heather said and turned to Chef. ""Got anything for removing jellyfish?"" she wondered before getting zapped again.

Shawn went back to lying down until he saw Duncan leading a rabbit towards him with a carrot while he was walking backwards.

A pair of toboggans leaning against a tree had caught the eyes of the remaining campers as Chris began to explain the final challenge. ""And now, the final leg!"" he said grandly. ""The Blind Toboggan Race!""

""Say what?"" Sky said in confusion.

""Each team will have a driver, and a navigator,"" Chris explained. ""The driver steers, while the navigator shouts directions. Oh yeah! And the driver will be blindfolded!"" This made the teens gasp.

""Not many of you left,"" Chris noted as he looked over the remaining campers. ""Keep losing you guys!"" He laughed. ""Oh well. Uh...Sky and Cody, Ella and Mike.""

The non-competitors were briefly shown standing behind the finish line as the camera panned over to the highest cliff in the area. ""I know you're upset about Cinder,"" Mike said while looking at the course, ""but we have to focus on the challenge.""

""Cinder left me,"" Ella sadly brought up. ""And without even saying goodbye.""

""I'm really sorry, but we can't die right now,"" Mike pointed out.

They looked over at Chef, who was brushing something oily onto the bottoms of the toboggans. ""Just lubing 'em up,"" he said with a smirk. ""Get a little more speed going."" This got Mike and Ella worried.

The footage cut to Chef and Chris standing over the Gopher duo on their toboggan, Sky having donned the blindfold. ""On your marks!"" Chris said as he walked over to the Bass, showing Ella blind in front with Mike behind her. ""Get set!"" He put his foot on the edge of the Bass' toboggan, and took out an airhorn. The shot zoomed out to reveal Chef with his foot on the Gophers' toboggan, and as the host blew the horn, the two men gave the teens a push.

The music became fast-paced and hectic as Cody and Sky sped down the hillside. ""Left! Right!"" Cody called, Sky moving the toboggan according to the directions. The two passed behind a large tree, allowing the footage to move to the other team.

""Watch out for the tree!"" Mike warned, and Ella leaned the other way. As they sped off, the camera showed Sky and Cody hitting a sloped rock.

""Are we flying?!"" Sky panicked as the two ramped into the air.

""Would you feel better if I said we weren't?"" Cody said in worry. A splash was heard, and the Gopher duo were shown to have landed on the river. They quickly went over a waterfall, hitting a log lodged between two rocks and springing back into the air.

The Bass duo were shown again. “Ella! I really need you to steer! Cinder would want you to live!” Mike encouraged.

""Hey Ella! Look who I found?!"" Duncan cried out, revealing the rabbit in his hands.

""Ella!"" Mike said. ""Duncan found Cinder!""

""Cinder's back?! Hooray!"" Ella cheered. ""Let us finish this race!""

""Left! Right!"" Mike directed. As they raced down the hill, they saw Cody and Sky landing ahead of them.

""Right!"" Cody said as they sped past the trees. ""Left!""

""Right!"" Mike said before being alarmed. ""Left!"" Suddenly, an explosion went off just to the left of their path.

""What was that?!"" Ella asked in a panic.

The scene cut to Chris, holding a blasting machine, smiling as he presses the plunger. ""We had a few explosives left over,"" he explained to the camera, ""and I'd just hate to waste.""

Chris detonated more explosions, and the two teams were shown dodging the blasts, until another one hit close to the Bass and sent them flying off, much to Cody's surprise.

At the finish line, Lindsay was cheering while the Bass were looking stunned. The cheering then stopped as they saw Ella and Mike landing on the tape after their flight, breaking it and winning the challenge with Cody and Sky coming in after.

The Bass cheered and went to congratulate Mike and Ella. Ella removed her blindfold and grabbed the rabbit from Duncan.

""Thanks, Duncan,"" she said. ""I owe a lot to you.""

""Whatever. It's just a stupid rabbit,"" Duncan scoffed.

""I can't believe you found Ella's bunny,” Sadie smiled at the delinquent. “You're actually pretty nice.""

""What? No I'm not,"" Duncan quickly denied.

""Then why did you go out of your way to find the bunny when you didn't have to?"" Sadie asked.

""Whatever! She wouldn't leave me alone! Weird rabbit!"" Duncan kept on denying.

“I am smarter than I look,” Sadie said with a teasing grin.

""Okay, fine, I did it. Are you happy now?” Duncan confessed. “Listen, don't tell anybody, okay? I don't want 'em to think I'm soft or anything.""

""I'm good at keeping secrets. Don't worry,"" Sadie reassured with a wink.

Confessional: Duncan

""I'm not nice, okay?"" Duncan said firmly to the camera with a threatening look on his face. ""Just to set the record straight.”

Confessional Ends

The camera panned over the campers, Brick, Heather, and Shawn back with their teams. Heather had a few adhesive bandages on her face but looked fine, while Brick was confined to a wheelchair Chef was holding and still gurgled every now and then.

""And the Bass are the winners of the toboggan race!"" Chris announced, and the Bass cheered and celebrated their win.

The scene shifted to nighttime as the elimination began, the camera panning from the six members of the Screaming Gophers to Chris and his plate of marshmallows. ""Who wants a treat?"" he opened. ""A tasty goody that represents exemption, security, peace of mind-""

He was interrupted by Cody. ""Can you speed it up a little?""

Chris immediately popped up behind Lindsay and sped up his speech. ""And if you don't get a marshmallow, you have to walk the Dock of Shame and you can never come back!"" He ducked behind Lindsay and showed back up close to Cody's face. ""Ever!""

""Let's see...one for Cody, one for Dawn, one for Sky, one for Lindsay!"" He tossed four of the marshmallows across the fire, and Cody, Dawn, Sky, and Lindsay happily caught them in their mouths.

""Looks like we only have one left,"" Chris said as the view moved to the remaining campers. ""Heather and Brick,"" the former looked nervous and the latter had no response since he was still in his wheelchair and not recovered, ""the final marshmallow.""

Confessional: Cody

“Brick's not in good condition right now, so we had to vote for him rather than Heather for his own sake,” Cody grumbled before changing his mood. “Though I did find a way to give Dawn some alone time with Brick.”

Confessional Ends

""Are you going to give the marshmallow or what?"" Heather asked.

""Don't rush me!"" Chris protested. ""The audience eats up this kind of dramatic conclusion!""

“Whatever,” Heather huffed.

""...Heather,"" Chris gave the marshmallow to Heather, who received it with her hands.

""Brick, the Dock of Shame awaits, bro,"" Chris told the wheelchair-bound boy. ""I guess we can help you get there.""

""I'll do it!"" Dawn volunteered and began pushing Brick to the dock.

""Bye, Brick!"" Sky said.

""Get well soon!"" Cody waved.

The shot cut to Dawn and Brick at the dock.

""It's a shame that you have to leave this early, but it is for your own good,"" Dawn gave off an apology, and Brick could only gurgle in response.

“Even though we haven't had a lot of moments together, I still cherish them, and I know you do as well,” she continued.

The Boat of Losers arrived, and Dawn gave Brick a peck on his cheek before placing him on it. ""Hopefully you get a safe recovery. Farewell,"" Dawn said goodbye to Brick as the boat drove him away.

I’ve been an Arsenal fan since I was 11, because my youth team was called The Arsenal. Got lucky—our coach could’ve named us the Spurs, but he was a wise old bastard and called us The Arsenal. Best three years of my youth career. I’d follow that man into the gates of hell if he called me tonight.

The club’s always meant something to me. But two years ago, my son was born—and everything changed. My wife and I went through as complicated a pregnancy, birth, and post-birth stretch as anyone can imagine. Everyone ended up alive and healthy, but it was a war. My job, you ask? Let my wife recover and handle everything else. That meant 11 pm, 2 am, 6 am wakeups. Feed the baby. Make the formula. Brew coffee. Get my shit together for work. Morning were my time to be a husband. Weekends became my time to be Dad.

I didn’t love it at first. It was hard—exhausting, crushing at times. Then the Premier League season started a few months after he was born. And let’s be honest—there’s not much else on at 6 am. So it became our thing: formula, change a poppy diaper, coffee, and The Arsenal.

I got him a bruised banana jersey. Two boys, sharing something that was probably the first part of my legacy to him. He’s almost two now—and he’s into it. He claps, he shouts, still shits his pants (who didn’t after Declan’s banger). But after the Madrid game, it hit me: he doesn’t care about Arsenal. He cares about being his father’s son. It’s about time with his dad. He sees something that matters to me, so it matters to him too. I’m his. He’s mine. 

Isn’t that the whole point of this club? A place you belong. Something you share. Something you pass on to those who belong to you.

These last two years—watching the team grow, the young guys step up—I’ve never been prouder. Of them. Of myself. Of my son. I’m still figuring this whole dad thing out, but I know one thing- the bond… it’s being forged everyday, but The Arsenal is a critical piece of it. From early morning Gunners to the rest of the day ahead.

We’re gonna win the league soon. Maybe even the Champions League this year. But no doubt—this is my club. It’ll be his too. It’s ours.

And thank fucking God our coach named us The Arsenal. Because I could’ve ended up some cunt watching Bruno Fernandes flop around or supporting the spuds. 

Here’s to being lucky. Here’s to being a Gooner.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Cleveland Guardians, two teams that have been flirting with mediocrity like it's a high school crush. As they prepare to face off at PNC Park, the Pirates are hoping their bobblehead giveaway night will distract fans from their .197 team batting average. Meanwhile, the Guardians are hoping to shake off their recent series loss to the Orioles and prove that they can win more than just three games as underdogs.

The Pirates have Paul Skenes on the mound, who is as reliable as your morning coffee with a 2.96 ERA. On the other side, the Guardians are sending out Ben Lively, whose 4.87 ERA suggests he's been anything but lively on the mound this season.

Now, let's talk odds. The Pirates are favored with a moneyline of 1.56, which is about as exciting as watching paint dry. The Guardians, on the other hand, are the underdogs with a tempting price of 2.5. Given the Pirates' struggles with the long ball and their inability to hit anything that isn't a bobblehead, the Guardians might just have a fighting chance.

For the best bet, let's take a look at the totals. With the line set at 7.5 runs, and considering the Pirates' offensive struggles and the Guardians' decent lineup, the ""Under"" at 2.0 seems like a solid play. After all, this game could very well be a low-scoring affair, with both teams trying to outdo each other in the art of leaving runners stranded.

So, grab your popcorn and your bobblehead, and get ready for a game that might not be a slugfest, but will surely be a test of patience. Go with the ""Under"" and thank me later when you're cashing in your winnings.

I was on IAD-SFO flight last night. The day before, I had  cut my finger pretty deeply and thought it was healing. On the flight, I must have bumped it, and it opened up again, causing a lot of pain. I went to the galley to ask for a band aid. They couldn't find one, but the FA was concerned, and ended up getting me a band aid from her personal kit.  Later, as she was serving coffee, she recognized me (among all the Y passengers on a 787-9) and checked in to see how my finger was doing and if I needed anything else. 

Like I said, this  may not be a big deal any other day, but returning on a long night flight home from a four-day conference, that extra bit of kindness made a big difference. Thank you, Shana.

It’s part of a broader creative studio I’m building called *Greenscreen Commune*, which will launch its Patreon in July.

Right now, here’s what’s happening:

* **Reddit** is growing fast under a personal handle (@mikebwriter), so it’s more about connecting with individuals rather than branding. I figure I’ll funnel the right people to my Patreon when the time comes.
* **Instagram** is growing slowly but consistently: 6 posts, 5 followers, 33 following — building in public with real art and BTS.
* I’ve got a **business explainer video** live on my website now, and another one coming in 4–5 weeks.
* A **feature preview** of my first major zine-book *NerdCulture: Coffee & Conversations Vol. 1* drops on the site in 3 weeks.

Would love advice from people doing something similar — how did you turn early momentum into sustainable growth? How do you bridge the gap between building followers and launching support platforms like Patreon or Gumroad?

Appreciate any thoughts or battle stories — especially from anyone who made it out of the awkward ""everything’s still launching"" phase.",1,1745028844.0,findapath,1,1.0,False
