1gyi9jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/1gyi9jo/should_i_post_this_on_my_facebook/,Should I post this on my Facebook? ,"TW: emotional abuse, mentions of suicide and domestic abuse in general.

I am wondering if I should post this on my private Facebook page? I want to raise awareness and help people that may be in the same situation, but I'm also afraid that something made go badly if I post it. I've left out names etc, but people will know who I am referring to. I've also left out a lot of other things that happened that I'm still uncomfortable talking about. I always want to be transparent about my mental health struggles but talking about that happened to me in this situation just feels different. Thoughts?



One year ago this week, I moved into my flat with the help of my best friend and my incredibly kind bosses. I was moving in an attempt to start a new life away from the most soul destroying relationship that I had ever been in in my life. One that started out pretty normal, but in hindsight, there were a lot of red flags right from the beginning. At the beginning I was told I was the most amazing beautiful girl he had ever met. His soul mate, the love of his life. He could not live without me. I had poetry written for me and we had so much in common. We even had the same pin numbers and codes to unlock our phones. He told me he thought we were ""meant to be."" I never wanted to rush into anything, but I always felt like he was rushing me to get to the next step in our relationship. He would stay at my house while I was at work, making my housemate uncomfortable, and eventually he moved into my house within a month of officially dating, to ""help me out financially."" He insisted on meeting my parents really early on even though at the time I wasn't comfortable with it. When he met my parents he lied to them about his drug habits, and told them that all he wanted to do was take care of me because I was the most amazing girl he had ever met.

At the same time I was constantly told that I was an insensitive and unempathetic person. That I was selfish and rude, and incapable of respecting another person's boundaries. I only cared about myself. Repeatedly yelled at for being ""deaf"" and ""fucking autistic"" when I misheard something or misunderstood something.  I was constantly lied to and had my phone looked through while I slept to 'test my honesty' later on. At one time I was woken up in the middle of the night and screamed at because he had gone through my phone and found messages to a friend about how I was thankful for a friendship I made with an ex partners 3 year old little girl. To him this meant I was 'not over my last relationship' and I had to delete all photos I had with her, which I did but it really upset me. I was so stressed from living like this, I was throwing up every night and had developed stomach ulcers and severe gastritis. My menstrual cycle was non existent throughout most of 2023 and he told me I had probably ""caught an STD from my ex that had made me infertile."" He was constantly trying to turn me against people close to me and got upset when I wanted to go out and do things with male work friends. He was always accusing me of flirting with male friends, and telling me that they wouldn't want to be just my friend anyway. I missed numerous events with friends because it would have been ""disrespecting his boundaries to go out."" I was shouted at and constantly told that I remembered situations wrong. Any argument was always ""made up for"" with gifts and promises to do better. Sometimes he just gave me money. He told me how  he got neglected as a child, bullied at school, cheated on in previous relationships, all an excuse as to why he acted the way he did. As his behaviour got worse and worse, it seemed like his reasons got worse as well. I felt sorry for him. He would pick arguments with me as soon as I woke up, and when I told him I had to go to work, he would tell me I was selfish and never cared about him or his needs. I'd be late constantly because he would tell me I didn't care about him if I just left him to go to work. On the occasions where I said I wanted to break up, he told me that without me he would kill themself. I felt like I was responsible for his life. Things weren't always horrible, some of the time it was good, and we had fun together. But it was like being on a rollercoaster. The lies were constant. And he couldn't keep any of the promises he ever made.

When I finally had the courage to leave he tried to convince me that I was having a ""borderline episode"" and I didn't know what I was doing. Living with him did make me feel like I was going insane, but I knew I didn't want to be with him anymore. He told me that if I broke up with him I would end up alone because both my parents would die, my friends would abandon me and no one would ever love me because I am a truly terrible, narcissistic person incapable of maintaining a relationship. That's what I deserved because I was such a selfish person that only loved myself and used people. The night my boss helped me move into my unit, I turned off my phone because he would not stop calling me. When I turned it back on later that night, he had sent me a photo of him standing on a ladder, about to hang himself. Later, he text me asking to pick him up from the hospital where the police had taken him - he really wanted a cigarette. 

I felt like what he did was my fault, but I did not want to be in a relationship with someone that treated me like that anymore. He said he would change, be better and stop lying but I didn't believe him. One night he came over to talk to me, but when I was firm on not getting back together, I walked him outside to his car and he put his face really close to mine and told me ""I still want to kill myself"" and told me that he'd take all of his valium and drive his car into a building if I made him leave. I made him come inside and messaged his mum to come pick him up but when he realised he called her and told her that I was lying and trying to make a drama. She came anyway and took him home. 

After this, I just worked a lot. I didn't have a lot of money and I didn't have a lot of furniture. I had a single lounge chair that I got at a garage sale for $15 that had a bunch of rosary beads in it by surprise and my bedroom had my bed and a taxidermy goat head. My tv didn't work so I spent a lot of time listening to music and watering my plants. I talked to my cat a lot. I didn't know if I could afford to live by myself but it was better than living like how I was living before. I'd get multiple calls and messages a day but I would mostly ignore them. My hair was falling out. Occasionally I would get home to weird little presents on my door step and it made me uncomfortable. Poems on sticky notes, rolled up cigarettes, old hair ties that I had left in his car. I didn't want to leave the house in case I saw him anywhere.

He messaged me incessantly. He would not give up on trying to 'fix' our relationship which I was serious about ending. He'd spam my phone with loving messages and apologies, telling me he'd change, he'd never treat me like that ever again. He'd blamed it all on his own 'acute mental health episode' or the fact he was abused as a child, although the culprit of the abuse kept changing. He called me repeatedly, sometimes leaving nice messages, sometimes abusive ones. Sometimes I'd just get poems at 2am. He tracked my location through different apps. When I'd tell him to leave me alone his attitude would change back to telling me that I was the crazy one, that I needed to get help, that I was sending mixed messages, telling me I was over reacting and convincing me that I was the abusive one in the relationship, that I was the reason he tried to kill himself because I just discarded him after he did everything for me. He told me that how I treated him during our relationship was domestic abuse. He told me he couldn't live without me. He told me we should just be friends because he didn't want to not have me in his life. He told me that he actually broke up with me, and I needed to get therapy if I wanted him to take me back? I tried to ignore it all. I'd tell him to stop over and over. But it lasted for months. I was afraid to leave my house. I wouldn't go grocery shopping alone anymore. I'd only drive to and from work, but if I saw a silver car I'd have a panic attack. I cried more than once most days and and I'd cry at work and in public if I went out with friends. I locked myself out of my own house 3 times in one week simply because I was so stressed. Chunks of my hair were falling out every day. I kept it all in a bag to take to my doctor. I lost 25kg in about 3 months. I stopped eating because I wasn't hungry anymore. I didn't sleep much because I would wake up frequently just to make sure my doors and windows were locked because when I moved in he off handedly told me this place would be easy to break into. I was so anxious I would spend hours just cleaning or rearranging my house. I would call my mother every day and cry. I didn't want to have a relationship with anyone ever again. I thought I'd just be alone forever.

I went home over Christmas to be with my family and the messages and calls did not stop. When I came back he had organised to swap some belongings that we still had of each other's. I had arranged for a friend to be with me on the day and told him to arrive at lunch time, but when the morning came, he showed up unannounced hours earlier and told me he was there early 'to get it over and done with for my own convenience.' But I knew by this point it was just because he had to be in control. I told him to go home and come back at the time we agreed. But he didn't leave. He sat outside my bedroom window and waited while I pretended I wasn't home. He told me to stop wasting his time. He called me a bitch for not letting him 'move on with his life' and 'drawing this out longer than it needed to'. I called my friend and asked her if she could come over earlier because he had arrived sooner than expected, and she did. When she arrived and I let her in and he realised I was inside the whole time, he said I was a lying psycho. He said I was being a control freak. When I went outside with my friend to see him with his things he was really friendly and told me how good I looked, and gave me late Christmas presents. A bunch of crystals and a plant. He made jokes and laughed and acted like he hadn't even been just sending me abusive messages over text. When he had all his stuff he asked if I wanted to get a coffee and breakfast with him. I said no. He said thank you for the sunshine and I miss you brown eyed girl, and I went inside. 

I went back to work after the Christmas break, and the messages continued. When I eventually blocked his number he moved to emails. His emails mostly didn't make much sense. One sounded like a missing persons report for me. I was going to my doctor frequently and she told me I had PTSD. One day I decided to contact his 'ex girlfriend' on Instagram to ask her some questions about their relationship, he had told me that she had randomly dumped him and blocked him out of no where and it had really messed him up and it really confused me so I wanted to know her side of the story. When I asked her, she told me that they had never actually dated, they were just friends and when she had not wanted to go out with him he wouldn't leave her alone so she ended up blocking him. When I learned this I kind of felt like maybe everything he had ever told me was a lie.

In mid February my friend came with me to file for a DVO with the police. I bought security cameras for my house which my boss installed. The night before he was served with the order he came to my house unannounced, let himself in my back yard while I was watering my plants and refused to leave for 45 minutes until I threatened to call my boss to come over. The next day he got served with the order and his mother sent me a message on Facebook saying she didn't appreciate the police scaring her daughter when they came to the door.

I didn't go to court when the DVO was put in place. I didn't want to see him ever again. I lost more weight and more of my hair fell out, but the messages, stalking and harrassment (for the most part) stopped after that. In April, I went home to visit my parents and old friend from school. On the way home I was driving through a storm, and while I was driving out in the middle of nowhere I put all my windows down and I cried. At first it looked like I was driving through a rainbow. It just made me want to cry and say everything that was on my mind, so I did. I had kept the crystals he gave me for Christmas in my door pocket since Christmas. When I was driving through the rain I threw them out the window along with the red mini key chain he had given me, and after that the rain stopped and there was a double rainbow. I stopped on the side of the road next to a random paddock and took a photo of it, I thought that was important somehow. 
 
I've now been in my unit for a whole year. I feel like a completely different person to the one that moved in here. I feel like the old me died and the new me can handle anything now. It took me until May to start leaving the house on my own again, and my sleeping is a lot better. My hair has mostly grown back. I started painting again. I hadn't done any painting for almost 2 years, and I didn't think I'd ever be inspired to do it ever again. I met a guy who became my best friend who really made me feel understood and gave me the confidence to be myself again. He's the nicest, kindest, most talented and most emotionally intelligent person I have ever met. He really encourages me to be my true self and I feel like I have all my creativity back again. He really appreciates me for all my weird quirks and helps me forget about how damaged I feel sometimes. I'm so glad he's my partner.

Even though I have trouble sometimes getting that stupid little voice out of my head, I know I'm not a selfish horrible person that doesn't deserve any love. I'm know I'm incredibly kind and caring, and really sensitive to other people's feelings and needs. I'm actually highly empathetic and genuinely a good person. I respect people's boundaries and I value honesty and loyalty. I'm not insufferable, and I'm not a 'deaf autistic bitch' that deserves to be yelled at by anyone. I can be blunt sometimes but I'd never make a joke to make anyone feel bad about themselves. I'm not controlling or jealous, although I can admit I probably was a bit when I was younger and immature. Most of all, I'm not a victim, and I'll never blame my actions on how someone else treated me in the past. I did not deserve any of the treatment during that 12 months and the stalking and harrassment afterwards either. 

I'm not sharing this to get sympathy or for people to feel sorry for me. I don't want anyone else that is going through the same thing that I did to feel like they deserve to be treated that that way, and that it's going to get better. Because no one that says they 'love you' will yell at you or try to control who you spend time with or how you think. They won't lie to you and it won't get better. I've been wanting to do something to help people effected by domestic violence for a long time now, and the first thing I think I can do is start talking about it because it's not the victims fault and they shouldn't feel guilty or ashamed to talk about what happened to them.

2. The Power of Habit Stacking:
 * Link New Habits to Old Ones: Tie a new financial habit to an existing routine. For example, after your morning coffee, review your investment portfolio.
3. The Environment Matters:
 * Design Your Financial Life: Organize your finances, declutter your budget, and create a space that supports your financial goals.
4. The Importance of Identity:
 * Become a Saver, Investor, or Entrepreneur: Your identity shapes your habits. Visualize yourself as a financially savvy individual.
5. The Role of Patience:
 * Long-Term Perspective: Understand that financial success is a marathon, not a sprint.
 * Embrace Delayed Gratification: Prioritize long-term goals over short-term pleasures.

Foreigner who recently moved to Singapore a few months ago from Los Angeles. Have tried dozens of coffee shops in Singapore but have not been able to find a coffee akin to the Vietnamese iced milk coffee from back home. For anyone who has been to LA, I am talking about coffees from chains like:

Da Vien
Phin Smith
Airoma Cafe
Lee's Sandwiches

The coffee I am looking for is very rich, sweet and creamy, yet NOT bitter or with minimal bitterness due to higher cream to coffee ratio. These are easy to find in the ""Asian"" towns of LA and OC.

I find the ""Asian"" or ""Vietnamese"" coffees in Singapore are not sweet (even with full sugar), too bitter and too watery, with higher coffee water to cream ratio in general. I understand tastes differ and to each their own, but just wondering if anyone can help!

Btw the same applies to milk teas. For example, the milk tea in LA Asian towns are like-for-like sweeter, richer and creamier in general (even among the franchises from the same original Taiwanese companies). Welcome recommendations for those as well in Singapore!

Thanks all in advance!

We’ve had two trainers, and again, improvement is minimal other than better loose leash walking and quite a solid “leave it”.

She got neutered a few days ago (after a very stressful set of reactions at the vet while waiting for her to be admitted) and the first few days post op she was completely non reactive as she was just so tired. She was also ok with me not being around, would not follow me everywhere, and I could go to the shop briefly before having to calculate and plan days in advance so I could give her the short acting medication. It was a blessing and also made me realise how on edge I am living trying to manage sounds, windows, gates, etc. 

Since yesterday, she’s back to her normal anxious and reactive self and I’m once again, on edge. The regret, which normally comes and goes in waves has gotten back to me and I keep asking myself what did I do wrong, why me?

I’m moving to another country in four weeks with her, and while the general environment will be better (less dogs, more open spaces, no dogs in the block), I will have no support when I need to leave her alone, which I know will be so detrimental for my mental health as I won’t be able to make friends, go to the gym, etc. like a normal person. Of course, her wellbeing is my top priority, so taking her to environments that she cannot manage, or leaving her alone for longer that she can tolerate are not options for me. 

I can’t rehome her, but also, I’m overwhelmed by this feeling of grief that I will never be able to enjoy having a dog, never be able to take my dog with me to a restaurant, or simply be able to do my groceries or meet someone for a coffee without ensuring she’s had her medication three hours before.

When my partner and I chose our dog, we wanted a specific colour and were set on one pup. As she grew, she changed colours so we went for a different one a few weeks before they were ready to be handed over and that one ended up “unclaimed”. I kept feeling that was wrong even though the puppies were still with the breeder, and while I am by no means a superstitious person, I keep wondering what would have happened if we had stuck to the original puppy we were so fond of before making such a superficial choice.

I don’t know how people do this for 15 years of their life, but to all of you who are out there feeling like this and still showing up for your dog, advocating for them, and loving them unconditionally, I admire you so much. ",3,1732420289.0,reactivedogs,3,0.8,False
1gyi2bq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueScaryStories/comments/1gyi2bq/i_had_a_terrifying_experience_while_hungover/,I had a terrifying experience while hungover,"
So, something really strange and unsettling happened to me recently, and I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. Here’s what went down:

It was my friend’s birthday, and we all got pretty drunk. Nothing out of the ordinary for a party night. The next evening, we drank heavily again. I live with two of my friends, but they had to leave early the next morning to travel to another city for work. They weren’t going to be back until late at night.

That morning, I woke up earlier than usual, probably because I was still jet-lagged from traveling a few days prior. I noticed my friends were gone, and I had an assignment to work on, so I dragged myself to the living room and started working. But I was incredibly hungover and couldn’t focus.

It was cold, and there was some sunlight streaming in, so I decided to lay down on the carpet to warm up and maybe nap a bit. That’s when things got… weird.

I was lying there, staring at the door in the corridor. I didn’t see anyone, but I could hear the floor creaking repeatedly. It was subtle at first, but then I realized I couldn’t move. It felt like I was trapped between being awake and asleep.

Then I saw my mom. She walked into the room and started cooking in the kitchen while talking to me. But here’s the thing—I live abroad. There’s no way she was actually there. That’s when I felt a heavy, oppressive presence in the room.

Suddenly, voices filled my head, and they were terrifying. They kept telling me to end my life, saying there was nothing left for me to do, no other options. I was arguing with them in my mind, trying to resist, but they were relentless.

I wanted to call someone for help, so I “grabbed” my phone, which was next to me. My first thought was to message my mom, telling her something was seriously wrong. But just as I was about to send the message, my phone disappeared from my hand. I stared at my empty hand, confused. Then I saw my phone still lying behind me—I had never actually picked it up.

This happened multiple times. I’d think I was reaching for help, only to realize it wasn’t real.

Then it escalated. The voices became louder, telling me it was time to jump off the balcony. I live on the 7th floor, and I saw the balcony doors opening on their own. It was like something—or someone—was trying to lead me there.

At that moment, I felt something grab my legs and start dragging me toward the balcony. That’s when I finally snapped out of it. I don’t know how, but I managed to break free from whatever was happening.

When I looked around, it was evening. Hours had passed. The light in the apartment had dimmed, and my heart was racing. I was terrified. I ran to my room, quickly got dressed, and left the house. I walked to a nearby café, got a coffee, and just stayed outside for as long as I could.

This was easily the scariest and most surreal experience of my life. I don’t know if it was sleep paralysis, a hallucination, or something else entirely, but I’ve never felt that kind of fear before.

Does anyone have any idea what this could have been? I’m still shaken up and would really appreciate some insights.",3,1732420237.0,TrueScaryStories,1,1.0,False

1. I’m in a professional grad program and frequently wear business casual, so I need a tote that isn’t too casual for a networking event or interview, but still practical and functional enough for class. I’m open to leather, vegan leather, and nylon depending on the overall look. 

2. Needs to zip close!
3. Needs a shoulder strap. Okay if the strap needs to be bought separately
4. Needs internal organization, I’ll lose my mind if it’s just one open compartment
5. needs to be big. My laptop is small but I also have a couple notebooks, water, coffee, lunch, and breakfast along with other essentials. My Madewell tote is about 11 x 14 x 5 and it’s just not quite big enough. I’m targeting something more like 12 x 16 x 5.5, or bigger
6. I prefer a more structured look, something that stands up on its own. Not a requirement though
7. Preferred but not required- I love an exterior slip pocket for easy phone access
8. I’d like to pay 300 or less but I’m open to spending more if it’s perfect 


Some bags I’ve been looking at to give you a sense of my tastes, and why they’re not quite right:
- Cuyana easy zipper tote- the shoulder strap accessory pushes this over my price point. Plus it lacks the internal organization (and even more expensive for that add-on.) 
- Freja Paloma- love the look but no shoulder strap
- Lo & Sons trinity- a bit pricey and I think it’s a tad too business for my taste
- Calpak haven- this probably is the best fit for my requirements but am I wrong for thinking it looks kind of cheap?
- Lo & Sons O.G.2 - I can’t decide if I like the look. I think it just feels more mature (I’m 29 and I could see myself using this in about a decade lol)
- July Everything Tote - just looks a bit too casual from the customer review photos 
- Beis east to west tote - based on reddit, quality sounds pretty bad
- Cuyana System Zipper Tote- honestly this bag is a dream if I had the money! The bag itself is a lot but I’d need several add ons

1gyhxlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExclusivelyPumping/comments/1gyhxlv/breastfeeding_hunger_and_low_supply/,Breastfeeding hunger and low supply,"I thought I was low supply/just enougher.

Turns out, breastfeeding is giving me FOOD AVERSION, like in general.

So initially (flying high on pregnancy hormones) my breakfast is robust: 3 eggs, 3 bacon strips, handful (or two) of cheese; a pint of vanilla yogurt, two cheese sticks, two packs of salami and cheese, my tea and milk, my coffee and milk, my huge water, and my lactation berry fizz…it’s my second and I learned from the first that dairy is my miracle healing food (high protein, high and whole fats)

With time however, I just stop eating. Instead of tracking my milk output I tracked my food. I ate 3 eggs with cheese and…nothing else. Not a d*mn thing for the rest of the day.

But I was FULL. Like almost sick to my stomach full.

Turns out, I just slip into not eating, and not for the fact that I’m busy, but literally me standing there thinking “am I hungry? No, I just ate!” and then I move on.

All this to say, don’t just “make sure you’re eating enough,” make sure you’re eating a MINIMUM amount of calories. I’ve set this mark at 2,000 cals goal per day.

TW eating disorder in this next line: I promised myself, in order to get through to at least six months breastfeeding, that I’ll allow myself to starve as much as I want in the future when we’re done.
That’s unlikely to actually happen; but I’m really trying to prioritize eating and not hating my body…it’s the first time my midsection is bigger than my hips. My shoulders have always been wider than both, but at least my waist was smallest for an illusory hour glass…anyway- tangent over.

EAT. And eat lots. Not just “get enough to feel good” I mean EAT MANY MANY CALORIES",0,1732419787.0,ExclusivelyPumping,2,0.5,False

Editing: I don’t really know where to begin or how long of post this will be. currently live with a couple of relatives in their small-one floor- two bed house. They’re doing what they can with what they have to make me feel at home. Also being super helpful and accommodating. I try to be appreciative and considerate on what they do for me. I also try not to take things for granted either. The living situation isn’t terrible but it isn’t good either. Lots of arguing, roaches, lack of space and privacy. 

I honestly feel like an intruder or an outsider to the home even though we’re all family. I don’t exactly feel I belong anywhere like I’m being excluded from anyone and everything. It’s so embarrassing and awkward for me at my age to be living with my parents. Getting car rides to minimum wage job because it’s getting too cold outside to walk. I had my future all planed out since back when I was in middle school. I would get my license, get a car, go to college, etc.. be someone different and make something of myself. 

I honestly don’t have hardly ever anyone to talk to. Literally my very few friends and family have given up on me. My mom, my father, my stepfather, my brother, my sister-in-law, my stepbrother, my online friend from Colorado, the other one from Illinois. They’ve don’t want me to talk to them and they’ve all either stop contacting and or leave me on read.  I literally have hardly anyone to talk, like to vent to about my day. All my feelings are being shoved down and bottled up. I’ve tried cry in the shower and just like let it all out but I feel so numb and distant from myself. In the past week or so I’ve been acting different. Like being irrational and impulsive. 


People at work treat me differently and I’m wearing different clothes. I have a hunch about the different uniform, the hour and day changes, the work or less work they give me. I point it out online and others think I’m overthinking, or idk what I’m talking about. But I have my insects and gut feeling about work. I see new hires wearing the building logo hats. While me and one other person has to wear our suppliers hat and coat. I also see work being handed off to other people in my department. Like last year I asked for a department transfer and they never did. Two times at least I’ve asked. 

It’s so easy for people around me to form like groups and talk and hang out. I’m just the weird outsider in the corner. I try to talk at home and work but it doesn’t seem like I’m being understood. 

There was this guy, I’ve never at least to my terrible memory and  dissociation . Have had a guy approach me and treat me like he did. kind, caring, considerate, and compassionate to name a few. I liked how he would talk about factoids and the things he takes great interest in. We had things in common like age, favorite movies, video games, shows, seasons, holidays, etc.. but there was this girl who didn’t like what we had. I don’t like her all that much. I kinda know her type, superficial, fake, attention and credit taking etc.. I notice how different she treats me compared to others in our department

I feel stuck in this limbo, week after week it gets to be the same. I wondering when they’ll let me go at work. Not that I want to be let go but I fear it. I try really hard to make it work, but I feel something’s off. They don’t seem to be giving me new work or advancements at work. I’ve asked to learn how to do a thing or two. They do those things when I’m not around. Quite literally the manager did this one task the other day when was I off. 

I have severe anxiety and an eating problem along with the depression. I’m scared to eat in the break room downstairs. It’s a dusty, stuffy windowless, room. I’m also scared to get food and buy it without the fear of people more specially coworkers making any sort of commentary. I also can’t really eat home- I get less eating or bring food home. I don’t really have where to put the food. Whatever I get either gets eaten up or expected to share. 

I try to changes somethings about me. I’ve gotten a haircut, bangs, I’ve scheduled for a hair color next month. I still feel like the same person. I bought a few books for each but I lack motivation. When I’m done sitting around at the coffee shop I sit around at home. I sit around listen to da much and or sleep it off. 

I really truly miss my step grandma, she passed away this week over a few years ago. I never really gotten the chance to say a goodbye. I haven’t even seen my stepfather in over year. Me and my mom had a falling out. We didn’t really agree on some things, like I didn’t like her bad habits and she wasn’t exactly helping me more so taking from me. I can’t really go and visit my stepfather because of her. Midwest 23f",2,1732419689.0,lonely,1,1.0,False

1gyhlri,https://www.reddit.com/r/denverrecovery/comments/1gyhlri/finding_connection_and_hope_in_denvers_recovery/,Finding Connection and Hope in Denver’s Recovery Community,"Hey, Denver Recovery fam! 👋

I wanted to take a moment to share some thoughts and hopefully spark a conversation. Whether you’re new to recovery, in long-term sobriety, or just curious about the path, I think we can all agree on one thing: Denver has an incredible recovery community.

From the serene beauty of the Rockies to the bustling city, there’s no shortage of ways to find connection and joy in sober living here. If you’re looking for ways to strengthen your recovery or just connect with others, here are a few resources and ideas I’ve found helpful:

🎨 **Try Art or Music Therapy**  
If you’re into creativity, Denver has amazing programs that combine recovery with art and music. Expressing yourself through creative outlets can be healing, even if you’ve never picked up a paintbrush or guitar before.

🧘‍♂️ **Explore Holistic Wellness**  
Yoga and meditation are big in our community, and there are plenty of classes tailored to people in recovery. It’s a great way to calm the mind and reconnect with yourself.

🌄 **Get Outdoors**  
Nothing beats a hike in the Rockies or a stroll through Wash Park to clear your mind and reconnect with nature. Plus, there are often sober hiking meetups where you can connect with like-minded folks.

🎉 **Sober Events**  
Denver has a growing scene for sober and sober-curious events. Check out alcohol-free comedy shows, game nights, and even yoga-and-coffee mornings. You might be surprised at how much fun it can be!

📚 **Support and Education**  
If you’re navigating sobriety, programs like SMART Recovery, AA, or outpatient therapy can provide valuable tools and support. Local recovery centers often have free workshops, resources, and group therapy options to explore.

I’d love to hear from you all:  
👉 What’s helped you the most in your recovery journey here in Denver?  
👉 Do you have favorite events, spots, or resources to recommend?  
👉 Any tips for staying strong as the holidays approach?

We’re all in this together, and I think it’s important to share our stories and lift each other up. 💚

Stay strong, stay connected, and keep thriving! 🌟",2,1732418662.0,denverrecovery,0,1.0,False

I need help!,"I (21M) am in my final year of bachelors. We are batchmates. We had the most beautiful relationship (like literally the whole class still tell the same thing) spanning 3 years. She broke up a few weeks back. I am hurt and devastated. We promised each other to stay together forever and we shared so many good memories. Yet she gave up on me just because she deserved someone better. She lost interest months before the breakup. I tried my best to get back her but I failed. She told she doesn’t want to be emotionally reliable on anyone and we can’t be friends anymore (wrote a long ass poem for her, but it was too late)

I always showed my vulnerable side only to her because you share your daily challenges only with those whom you love. That made her feel that she had never listened to her problems with me. I am the most patient listener and I always insisted on sharing her problems which she didn’t. She claimed that I didn’t care enough. I was the most liberal, supportive boyfriend she could ever get and the fact that I got this at the end of the day was very disappointing. I still believe that she’s the best girlfriend I can ever get and I don’t know how long it might take for me to move on (might be never).
 
She lost many of our mutual friends in class due to various reasons. I was the one who always stood for her despite everything and yet I got the same treatment from her. My friend circle grew yet I feel so lonely without her (I’ll elaborate in the next para). I approached her a few days back and got rejected, telling me that she’s never gonna come back to me ever again. We are in no contact. As of now, we have muted each other on Instagram. She has changed a lot post-breakup.

A few months ago, she grew very close with another classmate whom she claims as “ brother”. I don’t agree whether they are in a relationship but I know for a fact that she has literally replaced me with him. They come and go together, hang out together, eat together, everything (he had a thing for her in the initial days and due to some reasons she even blocked him; they patched up a few months back). The way she acts around him is irritating. She appreciates him for doing the smallest of things but I never received one when I did the same. Looking at them, any third person can claim that they are in a relationship; that’s how they are literally! She claims that I, along with my other friends spread rumours that she is in a relationship with her “brother” which is not true. I shared my frustrations with a few of my friends who are now taking this as an advantage to show grudges towards her and her “brother”. I don’t want to associate with the “rebel gang” against her anymore. I am tired and I don’t want to do anything.

The scariest part is I have to face both of them TOGETHER in a group project for an entire semester from next month. Watching both of them together literally boils my blood (they dare to get up and have a coffee together on my face)

I am preparing for the civil service examination and these thoughts are hindering my preparation. Still working on it

Honestly, I do not regret our relationship. Those were the most amazing years of my life. She was always very supportive and caring. Even after everything, I still want her to be happy and successful. She still has all my love and respect. At this point, I don’t even want us to get back together. But, I don’t deserve to go through this after whatever she did and doing to me. I want her to realise her mistakes. I want her to be normal. I want everything to get back to normal. I do admit I made many mistakes, and so did her which is completely normal in a relationship. But she chose to run away from the problems instead of facing them. 

Please, I need help!

He was yelling at my mom when she got there too so if she wasn't already mad, that made it worse.

1gyhib3,https://i.redd.it/3nqxkzr5pr2e1.jpeg,Why I love rubber ducks,"This is long, but bear with me. I want to share my story.

I grew up with a teacher and mentor named Libby. Once I became an adult, Libby and I continued our friendship and met for coffee once in awhile until I moved away from our home state. On one of these coffee dates, Libby was lamenting the chaotic state of her life.

""I need to get my ducks in a row,"" she said, head in hands. Then she raised her head and looked at me and exclaimed, ""but I don't have any ducks!""

After we went our separate ways that day, I was shopping downtown and found the perfect gift for my old friend: Two rubber ducks. I presented them to her the next time we met. Now that she had some ducks, she could put them in a row, and everything would be okay. 

We still kept in touch after I moved away. In January of 2024, she sent me a picture of two faded rubber ducks on the windowsill in her kitchen. 

""They're still in a row,"" she told me. It had been over a decade since I'd given them to her by that point. ""Everything must still be okay.""

Libby died on February 7, 2024. She was 87 years old. I am honored that I was able to call her my mentor and best friend for the last 27 of those years. 

In May of 2024, I got a new job as an instructional designer for a major US retail company. Libby had always been proud of my teaching career, even if it was a little nontraditional, and I was sad that I couldn't share the news with her. I wished that there was some way I could know that she was still with me somehow. 

The next day, I found a tiny resin duck while walking the dogs, and I knew it came from her. Of course, one duck can't make a row, but that's okay. The next day, I found another, and after that, two more. Now I could get my ducks in a row. 

In late August of 2024, my husband and I bought our first house. Once again, I wished I could share the news with Libby. Once again, I found myself missing her. Walking home from the grocery store one day soon after, I crossed through a park with a small pond in it. Ducks flocked to that pond. I stopped and snapped a picture of them, and when I turned around, on the sidewalk was an orange rubber duck with thin yellow stripes. I picked it up and put it in my bag, and once again, I knew Libby was still with me.

After that, I decided to share the joy of rubber ducks with others. I gave them out for Halloween, and the kids in the neighborhood loved them. Seeing how happy they made people that night made me feel like I was keeping Libby's spirit alive. It was a scary time in America, but these little rubber ducks were giving people joy, a glimmer of hope in darkness. 

That was when I decided to become the Rubber Duck Witch. I started leaving ducks around my neighborhood in Providence. I had little cards printed up to go with them that said, ""I hope this duck reminds you that you matter, you are loved, and you are not alone. Thank you for being you. Have a great day!"" 

And so, here I am. Bowie, the Rubber Duck Witch. Libby would love it if she knew. Then again, right after I gave out my first batch of ducks, the crows I feed that sometimes bring me presents in exchange for peanuts left me a little resin duck wearing a Santa hat, so... Libby knows. And she loves it.

Chapter Thirteen: Servants of Maltos

Memory Transcription Subject: Raksim

Date \[standardized human time\]: October 2nd, 2136

The entrance hall of Kaltis Tower was chaotic. On the ground floor, earthbound species went about their morning duties by dodging and weaving between each other in a disorderly mass. If they had to get somewhere particularly quickly, they trotted on the periphery, not stopping to apologize if they bumped into someone. Airborne species could navigate above the disorderly mass, thanks to the enormous cavity at the building’s center and its high vaulted ceilings, but the sheer number of them still necessitated sharp turns or dives to prevent collisions.

In spite of its tumultuous nature, the crowd parted for me and Director Kala. Such was the respect they had for us. The more subtle individuals turned an ear to us as we passed, hoping to catch a fragment of our discussion. The snout-pointers and the stupid couldn’t help but stare.

“Anyone with a functioning brain can see that we’re making a mistake!” I shouted at the Director’s back, only to be met with an unsettling silence. “The humans may be predators, but they’re clearly less murderous than the arxur. We can make use of them!”

Kala suddenly wheeled around to face me. Her crude robotic arm grabbed me by the throat and pulled me so close that my beak almost collided with the aluminum facsimile that replaced hers. “We will \*not\* discuss this here,” she hissed in a tone that made my feathers raise. “Not with so many eyes on us.”

The crowd, knowing they’d been caught eavesdropping, turned their heads away.

“Very well,” I croaked through the metal claws that were constricting my windpipe.

She let go, turned her back to me, and continued on, with me following close behind her. She made her way to the elevators, where her mere presence caused a waiting crowd to disperse. She pressed the call button and waited.

A zurulian, a duerten, and a drezjin greeted us when the doors opened. 

“Going up?” the duerten asked after an awkward pause.

I hissed sharply and sent them scrambling out of the elevator, allowing me and the Director to take their place.

Kala pressed the button that would take us to the very top floor of the tower. The doors slid closed, and music began emanating from a speaker in the elevator’s wall–the kind of music that harchen record labels produced to appeal to every species and taste, only for it to fail to be liked by anyone.

“Should we continue?” I asked, hoping our conversation would drown out the infuriating melody.

With a series of clicks and whirrs, the Director pointed a metallic claw at a camera in the corner of the elevator. 

I grumbled and stared at the wall. The music continued playing, causing my beak to clench tighter and tighter. For a moment, I considered driving my claws through the speaker to silence it, but the doors opened before I could act on that impulse.

A flock of krakotl stared at us through the open doors of the elevator, which could only mean that we weren’t on the top floor yet. The dumbest of them shrugged and tried to join us in the elevator, but her smarter friends dragged her back by her tail feathers.

The doors slowly shut and the music started once again, prompting Kala to raise her metal arm, pry the speaker off the wall, and smash it underfoot. “Remind me to have that fixed later… and to erase the security footage.”

“Of course,” I replied.

We spent the remainder of the journey to the top floor in blissful silence. 

The doors parted for the final time, bathing the elevator in the warm, orange glow of Nishtal’s rising sun. Kala led the way into her solarium office, claws clicking against the ornate tile floor as she went. The room's décor was typical of a high-class krakotl like her—with plenty of comfortable perches and images of Inatala–but one particular item stood out. 

An arxur skull sat atop the Director’s desk, held up by a simple metal stand. Its vacant eye sockets and slack jawbone made it seem like it bore a stunned expression–the same face it made when Kala clawed out its jugular in exchange for the wing it dismembered and the beak it shattered.

I settled onto one of the perches in front of her work desk. “As I was saying–”

She silenced me with a metallic claw as she passed.

I rolled my eyes and let her proceed.

Kala strutted behind her desk, opened a drawer, and produced a bottle of algae liquor, along with two small glasses. After pouring two drinks, she took a swig from the bottle and put it back where it came from. Then, she signaled for me to speak with a wave of her wing.

“I prefer mine with ice.”

She stared harshly at me. With a sigh, she took my glass to a small fridge in the corner of the room and used the machine’s ice dispenser to fulfill my request. She slammed it down on her desk with a thunk, and waved her wing again–much more impatiently this time.

I took a slow sip before starting just to vex her. “Attacking Earth is a mistake.” 

The Director inclined her head, allowing her metal beak to cast a glimmer of sunlight into my eyes. “Explain.”

“The humans have expressed their willingness to help us combat the arxur. Thus, we should make use of them instead of simply destroying them.”

Kala swished her alcohol around and chuckled. “And you sincerely believe them? Need I remind you: they’re predators.”

“I believe the empathy test data the venlil provided.”

“The data they collected with flesheaters breathing down their necks?” she asked rhetorically.

I took another sip of my liquor and shook my head to recalibrate. “Even if the humans are putting up a ruse, their invasion of the cradle demonstrated that they’re far more cunning than the arxur. They would not risk annihilation by turning on us immediately. And, in the time they are working with us, we can use them to make incredible gains against the Dominion. If we handle them correctly, Kalsim and his ilk can swiftly destroy both of them after they have bloodied and weakened each other.

Kala narrowed her eyes and looked down her beak at me. “Who would provide them with sufficient weapons to do so? And why would the species that voted for extermination ever allow a single ship to come under the human’s control?”

“The kolshians didn’t vote for extermination. They have the military might to assist the humans and the political influence to contain radicals like Kalsim.”

“Are they containing him now? Command is already transferring ships and personnel for his ‘Extermination Fleet.’”

I hissed in frustration. She was right.

Kala held up her robotic hand before I could speak again. “These arguments are far too speculative. Do you have any more substantiated reasons for not snuffing out these predators before they become even more dangerous?”

I opened my beak, but no words came out. I stepped off my perch and paced about the solarium in thought. On one side of the room, I looked straight down into the void at the heart of Kaltis Tower and watched the people below go about their business. Various lines of argumentation played out in my mind. They all relied on the humans' potential uses and didn't meet her standard as a result. 

The other side of the Director’s office overlooked a complex of concrete and steel, where plumes of inky smoke and orange fire erupted from the various training courses. Beyond that was a vast expanse of verdant swampland, where flocks of colorful nonsapient avians rested or fluttered among the treetops, unbothered by our activities.

I shook my head and hissed at myself for my lack of focus. In the reflection of the glass, Kala stared at me and repeatedly tapped her beak with a claw. Tink, tink, tink…

I redirected my gaze to the close quarters combat course, where a prickle of gojid were earning their qualifications. Finally, an idea came to mind.

“What about the gojid refugees on Earth?”

“Better for them to die alongside their captors than live as cattle,” Kala said in a sickeningly mellifluous tone.

My feathers raised at the callousness of her answer. “Shouldn’t we make an effort to rescue a species that’s on the brink of extinction?”

“But what’s the point of rescuing the ones on Earth? They’ve all contracted predator disease by now.”

Another irritated hiss escaped my beak. I stalked over to Kala’s desk and leaned over it, nearly knocking over her prized skull. “The council didn’t vote for extermination! Some even voted for full diplomatic relations with the humans. If we go through with this, how long will it be until we’re considered too violent and unpredictable to be part of the galactic community? How long until an extermination fleet sets course for Nishtal?”

“The kolshians won’t let that happen to the Federation’s greatest enforcers. Furthermore, who would they replace them with?”

“The yulpa or drezjin would make strong candidates.”

“We’re back to hypotheticals.” Kala said flatly.

I sighed and glanced out the window again. From behind the horizon, a spaceborne frigate slowly rose into the sky. Its ascent rustled the surrounding trees, sprayed water in every direction, and sent avians fleeing in little bursts of color. Such a sight wasn’t unusual at Kaltis Tower. We were \[14 kilometers\] from one of the largest repair and refit depots on Nishtal.

“I have one more hypothetical for you.”

Kala took a large swig of her fermented algae. “Very well.”

“If the rumors are true, Kalsim is deploying our defense fleet in its entirety to his mission, leaving Nishtal and entire sectors of space undefended.” I turned the arxur skull around so it was looking at Kala. “Which begs the question…” I lowered my voice an octave and puppeteered its jawbone as I spoke. “What if we find out?”

She batted my claws away from her trophy and pulled it out of my reach. “The arxur are foul animals. They lack the intelligence apparatus to even learn of such an opportunity.”

“The humans will tell them.”

The Director cocked her head. “How could you know that?” 

“If you faced total annihilation, wouldn’t you threaten their enemy with the same?”

“Perhaps I would, but this is going nowhere, and I’m tiring of it. Why did you bring this issue up to me of all people?”

“You taught us to play the Servant of Maltos–to question our superiors relentlessly–even if their logic is sound and we agree with them. It kept us from making mistakes in the past.

Kala reclined on her perch. “You thought I disagreed with you?”

I blinked several times. “So you think attacking Earth is a mistake?”

“Of course, I do!” The director chuckled. “I was trying to find the flaws in your logic!”

“I was… doing the same to you.”

We locked gazes for a moment before breaking into bitter laughter.

“Was there any point to any of this?” Kala asked with a piercing tone.

“I thought you might be able to raise this issue to a higher authority, so we could reverse course on this disastrous decision.”

“Unfortunately, I am as powerless as you. We’ve both looked a gray in the eyes too many times for them to not reject our ideas as insane ramblings.”

“So, we’re in agreement and can do nothing to affect the outcome,” I said dejectedly. 

Kala finished what remained of her drink with a single gulp. “I suppose we’re finished then.”

“I have one more question: are our exterminators being summoned for this atrocity?”

“As of now, command isn't mobilizing anyone at this facility. I doubt Kalsim would want his fleet sullied by the likes of us.” A pensive look crossed her face. “Though he does keep company with Jala, and if what they say about her is true, we may not be as safe as we think.”

“Agreed,” I said as I turned to leave.

“Raksim…”

I looked back at Kala, expecting a final word from her. 

She tapped a claw on my unfinished glass.

I picked it up and downed it–ice and all–in a single gulp. I shivered as it burned its way down my throat.

“We will not speak on this subject again. Or both of us will end up as a pile of ash on the floor of a crematorium.”

“Of course,” I answered, my voice still hoarse from the alcohol.

Kala lifted her skull off its stand and made it speak for her. “Now, get out.”

I bowed my head respectfully and made my way to my preferred exit–not to the elevator, but to the balcony.

I pushed through the door, climbed up the railing, and spread my wings apart. In this position, I was able to sense even the subtlest breeze with the delicate movements in my feathers. A strong headwind prevented me from gliding as far and as effortlessly as I wanted, but I could make due with a short commute today, given I was already late.

I pressed my wings tightly against my side and stepped off the railing. For a moment, I was in complete free fall, with the wind howling past my ears and my stomach feeling as though it had risen into my throat. The terrain below surged toward me.

At the last possible moment, I spread my wings again and harnessed the momentum I had built to speed over the training complex, swiftly maneuvering around the taller structures as I went. The finale of my stunt sent me careening into a courtyard, where I slid to a stop in front of dozens of silver-suited exterminator cadets.

My theatrical entrance didn’t go unnoticed. They swiftly transitioned from milling about in their own little groups with their headgear off to forming orderly rows and standing at attention. Despite their best efforts, they still needed substantial improvement.

A single yotul, attired in a similar manner to the cadets, stepped forward and positioned himself before the group. He moved at a measured and deliberate pace and, upon stopping, stood straight as a board with his paws clasped behind his back.

The cadets shuffled nervously under his gaze. Many of them no doubt realized that they were just gossiping with a superior among them.

I greeted the yotul warmly as I approached. “Good morning, Larso.

“You’re late,” he said without even turning an eye in my direction.

I was unperturbed by his curtness. “I had a matter to discuss with the Director.”

“The Extermination Fleet?”

“Of course.”

“Are we going?”

“As of now, no.”

Larso’s posture slackened ever so slightly. Most people wouldn’t have even been able to tell the difference, but I knew better. “Should we start, then?” he asked.

“After you.”

The yotul flicked his ears forward. “Attention Cadets! Raksim, Head of Training at the Kaltis Initiative, wishes to address you.”

I paused briefly to survey my new exterminators. As expected, a little more than half of them were krakotl, but there was a healthy mix of other species as well. The yotul cohort was disproportionately large, with them making up ten of the forty cadets, but that was to be expected.

What piqued my interest was the yulpa sitting on her haunches near the back of the assembly. She held her fireproof hood in her tongue and fiddled with it as I eyed her. Her name was Yasiri. According to the records we had on her, she refused to ritually slaughter a predator. During her PD sentencing, her parents requested for us to take her in lieu of placing her in a facility. I had to admire their efforts to protect their daughter, but she wouldn’t be any safer here.

I broke eye contact with the Yulpa. “Welcome to Kaltis Academy. You are here because of a predator disease diagnosis. But instead of rotting in a PD facility, we are giving you an opportunity to redeem yourselves by fighting on the frontlines of our struggle against predation and barbarism. You will pave the way for colonization and bring the light of civilization to savage worlds. Furthermore, if one of our colonies suffers an arxur incursion, you will fight them. For both tasks, you must conquer and wield two things: fear and fire.”

On queue, Larso donned his headgear and retrieved his flamethrower from behind one of the pillars that surrounded the courtyard. He used the weapon to paint a thick line of fuel across the enclosure. Then he lit it with a small puff of flame. A wall of fire instantly divided me from the cadets.

“For your first test, you must walk from one side to the other!” I shouted over the flames.

For a moment, the cadets were deathly still. Eventually, the bravest of them–one of the yotul–put on his headgear and stepped forward. He waved a gloved paw through the flames, testing if he could feel their bite. He felt nothing and, with his cautious instincts satisfied, stepped through to the other side.

The yotul’s example allowed the others to unlock their courage. One by one, the cadets crossed over to our side of the courtyard, until Yasiri was the last person remaining. When the yulpa realized she was alone, her eyes went wide, and she tried to back away.

I fluttered over the inferno and landed next to her before she could escape. “Is there a problem?”

“I’m afraid of fire,” Yasiri answered, transfixed by the flames.

“Afraid of fire?” I laughed. “Only predators and dumb animals are afraid of fire. And you don’t look like a predator.”

Yasiri continued staring. “I didn’t want to do this in the first place,” she whispered to herself.

“I don’t care what you want. Walk through!”

“No, I can’t. It’s just… Can I just fail this course?”

“If you fail, they will transfer you to a PD facility, where they will torture you daily until they break you.” My low chuckle came from the back of my throat. “Or–given that you’re a yulpa–perhaps they’ll splay you out on an altar and do what they wish with you.”

Yasiri’s expression darkened. She lifted a hoof to take a shaky step forward, only to return it to its original place.

I launched myself into the air and landed on the yulpa’s shoulders. “I have precious little time for cowards like you! Larso!”

The yotul casually strolled through the flames that separated us, still brandishing his flamethrower. He sprayed fuel on either side of Yasiri, creating a \[v\] shape.

“What are you doing?!” the yulpa bleated.

“As I said before, failure isn’t an option here!”

“This is insane! You’re predator-diseased!”

“Of course I’m predator diseased!” I took the black-tinted visor from her tongue, slipped it over her head, and zipped it shut. “We’re all predator diseased here!”

Larso walked behind us and laid down another trail of gasoline, forming a triangle with Yasiri and me at its center. He turned his pilot light on and lightly touched it to the liquid on the ground. In less than a \[second\], the fire roared to life and surrounded us.

Yasiri bucked and spun wildly, trying to find an escape route that didn’t exist.

I stomped on her shoulders to get her attention. “Just walk through it! You’re protected!”

In spite of my efforts, the yulpa continued her frantic episode.

I turned an eye to Larso.

The yotul backed away and sprayed fuel into the center of the triangle, shrinking what little safe space Yasiri had. She froze as the flames crept closer.

“Walk through or burn!” I commanded.

Finally, Yasiri charged forward. She must have closed his eyes, because, instead of stopping once she made it to safety, she ran face-first into a column.

I hopped off her back. “What did I say? The fire didn’t hurt you.” I chuckled to myself. “The pillars, however…”

The yulpa shook herself, stood and set her black, emotionless visor against me. A wrathful snort came from behind the mask. Her tail lashed furiously behind her.

I raised feathers and displayed my talons. “Before you act, remember that I was killing arxur before you were even born.”

The yulpa struck her hooves on the ground, creating a crack that echoed through the courtyard.

I didn’t show any reaction.

Yasiri grunted and bowed her head to my intimidation display.

“A wise choice,” I whispered before turning to the crowd of cadets. “From now on, Larso will be your instructor. Listen to him and you’ll succeed.”

“Why do we have to take orders from a primitive?” One of the krakotl cadets asked loudly enough for everyone to hear.

The entire yotul cohort turned their heads and shot nasty looks at him.

Larso’s visor cast a cold, intimidating glare at the krakotl. “Because this primitive knows how to use a flamer and you don’t.” He raised his weapon and shot a fireball over their heads to accentuate his point.

Their panicked faces summoned a laugh from the back of my throat. “It seems you have the rest handled,” I said as I unfurled my wings for takeoff.

Larso stopped me. “Sir?”

“What is it?”

“I need your assessment before you leave.”

“Of course. Based on what I’ve observed, we shouldn't expel any of these cadets. Push that yulpa harder than the others, and she’ll succeed in spite of her cowardice.” I drummed my claws on my beak. “That yotul that crossed first–make him a squad leader.”

Larso bowed his head respectfully. “Thank you.”

I reciprocated the gesture before taking flight. Once I was clear of the buildings, I adjusted my heading for the section of the training yard reserved for more experienced participants in our program.

After a brief, uneventful flight, I landed amidst a gathering of exterminators. They had arranged themselves into squads of twelve prior to my arrival and, unlike the recruits, maintained rigid and purposeful postures. Their fireproof suits and flamethrowers showed signs of extensive use but were otherwise well-maintained and functional.

I chose one of the squads at the front of the formation to start with. There wasn’t much notable about them, except for who stood in its leadership position. She was a tilfish, and, unlike most members of her species, her carapace was slate gray instead of the more common reddish brown. She was here because of excessive aggression, like me.

“I recognize you. Myrm, was it?” I asked the squad leader. “That’s correct, sir!” the tilfish shouted.

“Your squad will be the first to perform the dropship interdiction exercise. Prepare yourselves and await further instruction,” I commanded.

“Understood, sir!” Myrm said as her squad began reading their weapons and inspecting each other’s fireproof attire.

The sleek and angular silhouette of an arxur dropship appeared on the horizon as they worked. Normally, such a thing would be cause for extreme alarm, but here it was a regular occurrence. The remnants of botched raids made exceptional training resources. In addition, someone had to do the dirty work of purging their filth before the scrap yards bought them.

We braced ourselves against the dropship’s downforce as it lowered itself over the training area. When it was just a few \[meters\] above the ground, the engine cut out, and it fell to the ground with a massive bang, shattering the cockpit windows and crumpling the hull in several places.

The troop bay door at the rear of the dropship opened not long after. A young yotul sauntered down the ramp and bowed theatrically before stepping out of the way for a team of technicians. One of them smacked him in the head and called him an idiot as they passed. 

The crew pried open two smaller doors on either side of the vehicle, allowing me to watch as they worked inside. They opened several panels in the floor of the troop bay and, with great effort, pulled six energy cells from their compartments. In all likelihood, they were mostly drained of any power they once held, but even in that state, they would make the dropship burn for days rather than mere hours.

I turned my attention back to the exterminator squad. “Myrm, what is the purpose of this exercise?”

""To stop an arxur raid at its source–at the dropships,” she said, her voice muffled by a fireproof hood.

“Come now. There’s more to it than that,” I said impishly. 

The tilfish’s antennae twitched. “To strike fear into the arxur by meeting them head-on.”

I glanced back at the technicians. They had finished their work and were wheeling the energy cells away for proper disposal. “Correct. You may begin the exercise.”

With a wave of her chitinous graspers, Myrm set her exterminator squad in motion. They split in two directions as they entered the training ground and took up positions behind the concrete building mock-ups on either side of the arxur dropship. They lingered, bodies tensed with anticipation.

A piercing buzzer echoed through the training ground and sent them leaping to action. They emerged from the hiding places and rapidly encircled the dropship, spraying fire as they approached to obscure themselves. As the exterminators closed in, half of them shifted their aim to the three entrances of the troop bay, engulfing it completely. The other half sprayed fuel into the engines’ air intakes and onto the cockpit.

It was a textbook maneuver. One I’d found to be extremely effective. 

All twelve of the exterminators kept firing for \[30 seconds\], extending their onslaught long after any arxur would have expired. Then, they moved to a safe distance and ended the exercise.

As the dropship burned, I could feel the heat on my feathers. It felt good, like the morning sun.

I chuckled in satisfaction as the squad leader passed me. “Well done, Myrm.”

The tilfish took off her headgear. “Thank you, sir, but is there anything I could improve?”

“You did everything according to procedure. The only improvement you could make was doing it faster.”

She dipped her antennae in understanding, but her mandibles seemed taught. 

“Was my answer not to your satisfaction?”

“No, it’s something else.”

“Tell me,” I ordered.

“I’m graduating soon. After that, I’m going to be fighting on colony worlds for a very long time–the rest of my life maybe. I was wondering how you kept going. Did it not tire you?”

“The years took their toll.” I gestured to my graying feathers and ran a claw along the crack in my beak. “But the first time I saw fear in the eyes of an arxur–it was a tremendous feeling. The thought that I could fight back against those monsters–using their own tactics–was intoxicating.”

The tilfish’s compound eyes were harder to read than those of other species, but concern was still clearly evident in them.

“You’ll understand when you experience it for yourself. Dismissed.”

Myrm and her squad fell back in line, and the next group stepped forward. The exercises would continue for the rest of the day.

Memory Transcription Subject: Lieutenant Isaac Yankovic 

Date \[standardized human time\]: October 31st, 2136

A deathly silence filled the cafeteria. 

The TV mounted in the corner of the room held everyone's attention. The morning news was broadcasting, and they had just aired footage of Chief Nikonus admitting—on a live broadcast no less–that the Federation had genetically modified omnivorous species to be herbivores.

Halvah, Brol, and the other gojid looked down at their shaking claws, as if they had suddenly realized how dangerous they could be. Grigoryev, sensing Halvah’s unease, put a comforting hand on her shoulder.

Wonderful. How am I going to deal with this? 

A strange croaking squawk interrupted my thoughts. The krakotl awkwardly perched on the chair next to me was chuckling to himself.

Brol stared at Raksim in disbelief. “How can you laugh at a time like this?”

Something broke inside the krakotl. He let out a full-bodied cackle with a dangerous, manic edge to it. “I had to be an exterminator for \[30 years\] because of my ‘excessive aggression!’ But we were always predators. I’m a predator! I’m closer to what a krakotl should be than any of the people who threw me in that facility!”

No one should be like you, old man.

“Thirty years?” Andrews asked from across the table. “That would mean you’re in your 40's, right? You look closer to sixty or seventy. I’m not an expert on krakotl aging, but–”

Raksim jumped onto the table, scattering plates and knocking over several drinks. Of all the things I could have saved, I chose my cup of coffee.

“That’s what you’ve chosen to focus on?!” The krakotl squawked. “Look what they did to me!” He opened wings, startling everyone in his immediate vicinity. It was easy to forget just how big his species' wings need to be to lift them. “This is what being in a facility for years did to me! What being an exterminator did to me!”

Andrews looked down in shame. “Sorry.”

“You’re a predator now, right?” One of the privates from First Platoon interjected. “Why don’t you try some meat?”

Me, Huang, and Jackson all fixed him a withering gaze.

He scrunched in on himself and fell silent.

Meanwhile, Raksim was looking down at the myriad of options at his feet. Bacon, eggs, breakfast ham…

“Don’t,” I ordered.

“Why not? I’m a predator after all.”

“You might have an allergic reaction.”

“Since when have you cared?”

I looked him dead in the eyes. “I don’t particularly care right now, but I also don’t want to drag you to the infirmary first thing in the morning or leave you at the mercy of those two.” I jerked my head toward our yotul medics. “Now sit down, shut up, and eat your vegetables, old man.”

Raksim’s hackles rose. He flexed his claws and stared at me with a dangerous glint in his eye.

I met his hateful gaze with one of my own–cold and uncaring. 

Everyone around us fidgeted uncomfortably or prepared to break us apart.

Andrews slowly stood and put a hand on Raksim’s wing.

The krakotl turned to look the Captain in the eyes before slowly lowering his talons. He stepped back onto his seat and settled into a perched position.

“As for the rest of you…” I looked to gojids’ table. “It doesn’t matter whether your ancestors ate meat or not. You’re still the same people you were before, and you still have training to focus on. Understood?”

“Yes, sir,” the gojid mumbled in unison.

“Good.” 

With that, I turned my attention back to my breakfast. Raksim sat in silence at the edge of my vision. Tears welled up in his eyes. For the briefest moment, I considered stroking his head to comfort him, but I remembered that doing so might cost me a finger.

I’m sorry, old man.

I have a lot of convos going and feeling good about my ability to continue conversations so far. One girl I’ve been talking to a lot asked if I want to meet in person so we are planning to do that soon! I’m very nervous but excited too. I haven’t had a friend “date” in a very long time. My husband is my main social outlet, along with work colleagues. My social interest and battery is very low. 
But I want to expand my support system and invest in friendships! Any tips for me for meeting this girl for the first time? I chose a public place I’m familiar with. My husband will drive me there and pick me up after. 
Of course I keep playing out scenarios in my head, wondering things like how does it work to order coffee? Will we both wait in line together or sit and talk first? How long should it last? What topics should I talk about? What questions should I ask? I feel like I’m preparing for interview but as an aspie/aut, this is just what I have to do. Being myself not going to work because I may just sit there smiling and nodding and saying few words if I just “be myself.” Is that normal? Are my questions/difficulty with socializing normal for autistic people? I’m ‘high functioning’ in most other areas of my life, but awful as social skills and never learned them.😔
I’ve also faced so much friendship rejection and bullying so this is a huge step for me to open up to another potential pain. But that’s life I guess!! I hope this could be a long term friend for me but I don’t want to put expectations on it. Overall I feel like I will try to unmask as much as I can, try to be positive and curious and if it leads to a friendship, great! If not, it’s a learning experience and nothing will be lost.

Very deeply in love. We dated for nine months.

Unfortunately we ended up being very toxic for one another. We would date for a couple weeks, and the I would break up with him for being too controlling and then I would forgive him and then rinse repeat. 

Control. Break up. Forgive. Get back together. Repeat.

This sounds toxic and it was toxic for both of us. His father cheated on his mother which led to their divorce and he hadn't worked through it and I was severely bullied in high school so I was extremely sensitive and very defensive. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is well it was very toxic, I'm 26 now, and can admit that we were both just very young. Either way, it was pretty bad for me. 

It took me years to work through what he put me through. I ended up reaching out to him four years later to get closure. I happened to text him on his birthday which I didn't know was his birthday at the time. Again, it had been four years, I legit forgot his birthday. We got closure and continued texting as friends. I told myself this was ok, as long as we never saw each other in person. 

Cut to now, and he mentions that him and his girlfriend broke up. I asked if he wanted to talk about it and he said no. 

But days later, he asked me to coffee. He didn't really ask, he said ""we should go to coffee"". 

I asked for time to think and he was like sure. I told him I didn't know whether I should go out to coffee with my ex boyfriend and he said don't think of me as your ex boyfriend and that he doesn't have any alternative motives. 

The reason I'm posting this here and not in r/relationships or something is because I am a firm believer in God's plan. It feels very purposeful that I couldn't stop thinking of him. It feels very important that I happened to message him on his birthday. I think God might be guiding me back to him. 

And then my mom sent me a Facebook post about a singles night so maybe God might be telling me, no go down a different road. 

Id asked my friends for feedback but a lot of them aren't religious. And my best friend hates this guy because of how toxic it was before.

 I am also not a huge fan of having points with three lenders. I value Chase the most but I just can't cant justify the gaps. Also, Hyatt continues to devalue points. Any advise? What has worked best for you?

I was a frequent poster on this forum, but I took a break from reddit for a while. I'm continued to give my husband farting experiences, but I have some new food restrictions that's making bringing about prolonged episodes of farting hard. In the past, I would just eat 3-4 chocolate oat fiber one bars, but I can't really do that anymore 

Here are my restrictions:
Dairy (ALL dairy, eating packaged food that is processed in the same factory is ok, direct dairy will give me intense stomach cramps)
Shellfish (throat closes up)
Peaches (these in any form will make me require medical attention)
Bananas (EXTREME stomach cramps)
EXTREMELY high acid foods (Oreos, very strong coffee etc)
Chocolate (I try to avoid it but I can have some, it gives me heartburn)

Everything else is ok. The problems with dairy and chocolate is stopping me from eating my normal fart food. Does anyone have suggestions on how I can work around this with a easy to eat processed product?

**Today we're going to focus on one of the most timeless of holiday gifts: Books**[!](https://imgur.com/a/jZEI4N0)

I've aspired to include a selection of different themes, leaning more towards image-heavy books where the language barrier won't be so steep.  Some of the books are translated to English, though!  I've also tried to include more than one Ukrainian bookstore that does international shipping so you can browse around and potentially find other selections that may interest you or someone special.

**Disclaimer:** We are not affiliated with any of the companies that appear here.

**Pro Tip:** Install a translation extension for your browser of choice, as not every shop has a built-in English option, but I did make sure that they all function with a translation extension and that they do international shipping.

He replied that he was flattered but that his life is a shit show and he’s not really in a position to offer anything to anyone else rn. I was bummed but understood. 

I guess since then I’ve been struggling with how to act towards him and then how to take care of myself. I’ve tried to act as normal as possible like nothing happened but I can’t help but think maybe something shifted. 

It might sound dumb but he used to always be the first one to like and comment on all my stories and I’ve noticed a significant dropoff there. 

Last weekend I messaged him because I was going to be in his neighborhood so I said if he wanted to go for a walk/get a coffee or something that could be nice. 

He ended up already having plans but overall his response was positive; he showed interest in what i was doing and told me about what he’d been up to. He was at an event that he thought i’d be into and said we should check it out sometime together. 

I guess now I feel that the ball is in his court and I’ve been trying to just move on mentally and focus on other things which has been going well. I actually muted his stories just to give myself some space but hope it hasn’t come across as passive aggressive or something. 

Part of me think it’s just a brain chemical thing that I’m struggling to regulate now that I don’t have the excitement of this crush. Phew. Any tips?",1,1732417385.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

1gyh7vy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1gyh7vy/spending_30_min_on_toilet_but_not_feeling_empty/,Spending 30 min. on toilet but not feeling empty,"Hi everyone,

I’m hoping to find people here who might have similar symptoms or can offer advice because I’ve been struggling with this for years without any real answers.

My digestive issues have been ongoing for about 6–7 years. It started with my bowel movements becoming very soft, often mushy, and it began taking me 20–30 minutes to go to the bathroom. Despite the long time, I rarely feel fully emptied. This usually happens in the morning, often after having a coffee, which I drink to speed things up.

I also experience bloating and gas, which made me suspect lactose intolerance. Although a lactose intolerance test came back negative, I immediately get symptoms (bloating, discomfort) when I consume dairy products. Because of this, I’ve completely avoided lactose, which has reduced the bloating but hasn’t resolved my irregular bowel movements.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:
	•	Various probiotics (no success)
	•	A gentle diet (e.g., oatmeal, potatoes, etc.) for two weeks (slight improvement, but no real change)
	•	Avoiding known triggers like onions, garlic, and spicy foods (helps somewhat but doesn’t solve the problem).

I’ve seen multiple doctors:
	•	A gastroenterologist dismissed me and referred me back to a general practitioner.
	•	One GP ordered an endoscopy, which revealed Helicobacter pylori. This was treated with antibiotics.

The strange part: During the antibiotic treatment (combined with a stomach acid protector), my symptoms completely disappeared. My bowel movements became perfect—done within 1–2 minutes, with ideal consistency, and I hardly needed toilet paper. It felt like a miracle, something I hadn’t experienced in years.

However, once the antibiotic treatment ended, the symptoms returned quickly, even though a stool test confirmed that the Helicobacter was gone. I also took probiotics afterward to rebuild my gut flora, but they didn’t help.

Now, I’m back to square one. My next gastroenterologist appointment isn’t for a few months, and I’m left without any clear path forward.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Do you have any ideas about what might be causing this or what could help? I’m especially curious why the antibiotics seemed to fix everything temporarily.

Any advice or shared experiences would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you in advance.",4,1732417361.0,Microbiome,8,1.0,False

We go on long walks together, text throughout the day and it feels like we can talk about anything, both silly and deep. He also does sweet things for me, like bring me the coffee I like or my favorite snacks. In general, he's a wonderful person and I'm super lucky to have him in my life. He's also very attractive (probably out of my league) and I've developed a (not so small) crush on him. I don't want to ruin our friendship by saying anything, but also want to gauge if he might be interested as I think we'd be really good together. Do you guys think he likes me/ should I shoot my shot? If it helps, he does have other friends that are girls, but no one he's as close to or spends time one-on-one with like we do.

They’re doing what they can with what they have to make me feel at home. Also being super helpful and accommodating. I try to be appreciative and considerate on what they do for me. I also try not to take things for granted either. The living situation isn’t terrible but it isn’t good either. Lots of arguing, roaches, lack of space and privacy. 

I honestly feel like an intruder or an outsider to the home even though we’re all family. I don’t exactly feel I belong anywhere like I’m being excluded from anyone and everything. It’s so embarrassing and awkward for me at my age to be living with my parents. Getting car rides to minimum wage job because it’s getting too cold outside to walk. I had my future all planed out since back when I was in middle school. I would get my license, get a car, go to college, etc.. be someone different and make something of myself. 

I honestly don’t have hardly ever anyone to talk to. Literally my very few friends and family have given up on me. My mom, my father, my stepfather, my brother, my sister-in-law, my stepbrother, my online friend from Colorado, the other one from Illinois. They’ve don’t want me to talk to them and they’ve all either stop contacting and or leave me on read.  I literally have hardly anyone to talk, like to vent to about my day. All my feelings are being shoved down and bottled up. I’ve tried cry in the shower and just like let it all out but I feel so numb and distant from myself. In the past week or so I’ve been acting different. Like being irrational and impulsive. 


People at work treat me differently and I’m wearing different clothes. I have a hunch about the different uniform, the hour and day changes, the work or less work they give me. I point it out online and others think I’m overthinking, or idk what I’m talking about. But I have my insects and gut feeling about work. I see new hires wearing the building logo hats. While me and one other person has to wear our suppliers hat and coat. I also see work being handed off to other people in my department. Like last year I asked for a department transfer and they never did. Two times at least I’ve asked. 

It’s so easy for people around me to form like groups and talk and hang out. I’m just the weird outsider in the corner. I try to talk at home and work but it doesn’t seem like I’m being understood. 

There was this guy, I’ve never at least to my terrible memory and  dissociation . Have had a guy approach me and treat me like he did. kind, caring, considerate, and compassionate to name a few. I liked how he would talk about factoids and the things he takes great interest in. We had things in common like age, favorite movies, video games, shows, seasons, holidays, etc.. but there was this girl who didn’t like what we had. I don’t like her all that much. I kinda know her type, superficial, fake, attention and credit taking etc.. I notice how different she treats me compared to others in our department

I feel stuck in this limbo, week after week it gets to be the same. I wondering when they’ll let me go at work. Not that I want to be let go but I fear it. I try really hard to make it work, but I feel something’s off. They don’t seem to be giving me new work or advancements at work. I’ve asked to learn how to do a thing or two. They do those things when I’m not around. Quite literally the manager did this one task the other day when was I off. 

I have severe anxiety and an eating problem along with the depression. I’m scared to eat in the break room downstairs. It’s a dusty, stuffy windowless, room. I’m also scared to get food and buy it without the fear of people more specially coworkers making any sort of commentary. I also can’t really eat home- I get less eating or bring food home. I don’t really have where to put the food. Whatever I get either gets eaten up or expected to share. 

I try to changes somethings about me. I’ve gotten a haircut, bangs, I’ve scheduled for a hair color next month. I still feel like the same person. I bought a few books for each but I lack motivation. When I’m done sitting around at the coffee shop I sit around at home. I sit around listen to da much and or sleep it off. 

I really truly miss my step grandma, she passed away this week over a few years ago. I never really gotten the chance to say a goodbye. I haven’t even seen my stepfather in over year. Me and my mom had a falling out. We didn’t really agree on some things, like I didn’t like her bad habits and she wasn’t exactly helping me more so taking from me. I can’t really go and visit my stepfather because of her. Midwest 23f",1,1732417169.0,depression,0,1.0,False
1gyh33v,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gyh33v/holidays_with_family_is_miserable/,Holidays with family is miserable,"Every holiday is so stressful for me.  My (41F) anxiety is through the roof every time.  My mom and sister just make it absolutely miserable for me.  My sister shows up late with Starbucks coffee in hand and sits and texts with someone while she is ""helping"" me cook, so it appears like she would rather be other people. She usually starts a fight with someone so she can storm off and leave right after we eat dinner and she takes a bunch of leftovers with her.  My mom has a separate property that is about 30 minutes from her house and about 45 minutes from my house.  She has 2 horses and a bunch of farm cats that she feeds.  She never rushes to feed all of them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter when I end up hosting Thanksgiving dinner.  My husband (43M) ends up watching the boys (well, sort of.  I end up having to yell for him to go look for them.) and I end up doing all the cooking by myself until my sister finally arrives.  I usually end up making a 30 lb turkey, 10 lbs of mashed potatoes from scratch, 5 boxes of stuffing (Stove Top now to save my sanity a little bit), croissants that roll up and bake yourself, and 2 pans of green bean casserole. Furthermore, my mom expects me to cook food for 40-50 people, so we have leftovers for days for us and her and my sister. There's usually less than 10 people that come.  My in laws come sometimes. My mom will pitch in on buying stuff but she won't pitch in to help on anything until the very end and then she acts like I'm a psychopath when she finally does show up hours later . She usually shows up about time for us to start serving lunch. My sister is the exact same way. She'll tell me she'll get there early and help me with the cooking but then she doesn't show up until 10:00 - 12:00pm.  We usually eat lunch at noon or so. The last few years I've been a witch and told them I'm not starting cooking anything until they get here. Then they get upset because they want to look at the Black Friday ads and go Black Friday shopping that night.  My mom has tons of stuff in her kitchen (think hoarder) so there would be no way to do it at her house.  Table is covered with crap and counters are covered too. There is literally no room to cook or to eat dinner. It is plenty big enough but she just has too much stuff everywhere.  My sister also lives with my mom so she can't host.  I end up beating myself up because I think to myself how many more holidays will I have left with my mom. She's 66 years old.  My sister is 33 years old.  I just hate the holidays.  I have a special needs child who is autistic and kinda verbal but still requires a lot of help. He is 9 years old and not potty trained.  We also have a 6 year old too.  My mom always insists upon having my husband go with her to the farm to help with the animals. She goes every other damn day by herself but on the holiday she expects someone to help her.  I don't let this happen. What would you do?  I would love some advice.  

EDIT: This year, we had family that invited us over and my mom and sister are saying they aren't going because they live about an hour away.  My response to them, ""Oh boo fucking hoo"".  I'm going early to make mashed potatoes and green bean casserole and help the host cook since I know how overwhelming it can be.  Then my mom asked me to go help her at the farm before we drove out there and she wanted to ride with us rather than drive her own car.  Hell no.  Tired of this shit.

1gyh2ow,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1gyh2ow/hawaii_wedding_budget_recap_55_guests_45k_daytime/,Hawaii Wedding Budget Recap - 55 Guests - $45k - Daytime,"We broke all the rules: We decided not to serve alcohol (since we don't drink) and host a BYOB Daytime Wedding...on a weekday...with no dance floor. Because of this, I was worried about our guest experience. Yet we received SO much positive feedback about how much fun people had. We sent 70 invitations, and all 55 guests who RSVP'd yes attended.

Our wedding was outdoors, which created social day-party vibes.

We rented lawn seating around a coffee table, a photo booth, giant jenga, giant connect 4; a friend lent us cornhole to play on the lawn; and we provided games for people to play including The Mind, Uno, Hawai'i-style Hanafuda, and kendamas! Our friends hosted the ""Shoe-ly Wed Game"" and ""Scavenger Hunt Musical Chairs,"" the latter of which got both the extroverts & the introverts involved.

Our placecards included a photo of us with each guest (some were photoshopped) attached to a printout with a QR code so guests could upload + view photos from the day. On the back of the card we had personalized and handwritten notes to each guest.

The day itself went by SO fast - we felt like we were just starting to socialize with everyone when we were given our 5-minute warning. I felt so grateful that a few days prior to our wedding day, we added an evening meet-up at a local karaoke bar.

Here is the recap of what was spent:

* **Wedding Coordination: $3,500** \- This included month and day-of coordination, bussing the tables, and help with set-up and breakdown. I loved our coordination team so much!
* **Venue: $7,350** \- The reason we chose this venue was for the view - so we felt so happy that the weather was PERFECT on our wedding day!! This location was also sentimental to me as it was close to where my grandparents were buried. Family members actually brought some of our flowers to the cemetery after the wedding. This cost included the stunning venue and a getting ready location we used for photos; tables/chairs/decor were not included.
* **Table & Chair Rentals: $2,070** \- This included chairs, dining tables, buffet line tables, and a sofa and coffee table set for the lawn.
* **Bridal Attire: $2,285** \- Off-the-Rack Dress $1,760, Alterations $210, Undergarments $72, Jewelry + Accessories $118, Getting Ready Robe $125. Our seamstress said the alterations were lower because I had a crepe dress that was easier to alter.
* **Groom's Attire: $678** \- This includes his suit from Indochino, additional alterations, and accessories (bowtie + belt). He used hand-crafted leather shoes he already owned from Swing Love Shoes.
* **Engagement Session: $734** \- Since we live in a destination wedding location where the photog doesn't always have engagement sessions with couples, our engagement session was a separate cost we opted into. This total includes the photography session itself, dress + alterations, and a mani/pedi. We used these photos on our magnet invites and decor on wedding day.
* **Photography: $4,386** \- This includes 6 hours of wedding photography coverage by Ann Ferguson Photography, plus a sunset session we added on after seeing our stunning engagement session photos.
* **Videographer: $3,660** \- This includes 5 hours of wedding videography coverage by Jon Bodhi Weddings, a 4-5 minute highlight film using narrative audio from the ceremony + reception (ours was actually 8 minutes); a separate ceremony video including all processionals readings, vows and ring exchanges; and a separate toasts film (we had 2 toasts).
* **Sound: $888** \- We hired a company who did the ceremony sound, and provided the audio equipment so a friend could use our phone to play from Spotify playlists during the appetizer hour and reception.
* **Photo Booth: $1,125** (Selfie Suite) - Before guests lined up for lunch, we asked them to line up at the photo booth for pictures with us! Although I experienced self-induced stress trying to move people from the photo booth to the buffet line, I'm so, SO grateful we took this time to get photos with every guest.
* **Officiant + Marriage License: $290** \- Cost associated with our Officiant (a family member) getting licensed, and the marriage license.
* **Hair & Makeup: $1,350** \- This includes Hair & Makeup for the Bride, Bride's Mom, and 2 Bridesmaids, in addition to a travel fee for both stylists.
* **Florals: $3,523** \- This includes bouquets, boutonnieres, leis, petal toss, arch + arch florals repurposed for our sweetheart table, cake florals, and bud vases for the table decor. I LOVED our florals.
* **Catering: $7,615** \- This included a charcuterie grazing table + 2 additional appetizers during appetizer hour, 2 protein entrees, 1 starch, salad, water, coffee, vendor meals, and catering staff. There was leftover food! While our caterer suggested sticking to the grazing table + 1 appetizer, and I guess I just wanted to make sure everyone was fed so I added the second appetizer.
* **2-Tier Wedding Cake: $265** \- We decided to order the cake for the cake cutting and not to serve it day-of. We shared the bottom tier with family members after the wedding, and froze the top-tier for our first anniversary. We could have done a single tier here and froze the remainder for our anniversary.
* **Self-Serve Desserts: $290** \- We served guests fruit tarts & Hawaiian-style chantilly sheet cake.
* **Beverages: $110** \- We ended up buying more beverages than we needed, but this cost included lots of water, apple juice, and soda.
* **Stationery & Prints: $475** \- Truly Engaging Invitations $210, Postage $40, Place Cards from Canva + Squared $85, Acrylic Signage $95, Pictures & Frames $45
* **Decor & Table-Setting Rentals: $1,900** \- This included rental use of chargers, plates, cutlery, water goblets, a cake cutting set, and trays for our self-serve dessert station. It also included decor rental like tea light candle votives, macrame table runners, baskets, an easel, and a garment steamer.
* **Furniture: $447** \- We bought items we could use later including a sweetheart loveseat, a table for the giant Jenga set we rented, and a cooler for beverages
* **Misc. Purchases: $863** \- including and not limited to napkins, dessert plates, takeaway containers, film + cameras, guestbook, wooden last name sign, vow books, ring holder, ribbons. Sadly, one camera with film inside was lost in the chaos.
* **Wedding Party Gifts: $586** \- We made gift baskets for both wedding parties including engraved Yeti wine glasses (which the groom's party used at our wedding!) and ALOHA collection pouches.
* **Vendor Gratuities: $800** \- We tipped HMUA, catering staff, the wedding coordination team, the photographer, and videographer

Total Cost: $46,081+ (estimated $22k contributed by family, and we paid for the rest). This does not include the cost of our Wedding Party who purchased their own attire and shoes, the Rehearsal Dinner hosted by my dad, and day-after brunch.

Total Gifts: $5,825, in addition to gifts from our registry. We had a smaller wedding, but this number includes gifts from my very large, very generous extended family.

We LOVE our photos from our photographer, Ann Ferguson Photography, who also shot our engagement session photos.

1gyh2oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonely/comments/1gyh2oi/i_have_such_a_hard_time_making_friends_that_i/,I have such a hard time making friends that I allowed the one friend I managed to keep to harshly put me down ,"(Yes I posted this in the mental health subreddit but realized it may be better for this subreddit)

I’m an early twenties female. I’ve struggled with my mental health from a very young age, a lot of it stems from bullying and unhealthy family dynamic. 

I’ve always had a hard time making friends since I have anxiety and am a little on the spectrum. 

A few years ago, I became friends with this girl online and we started chatting regularly since we couldn’t meet up all the time due to us living 2+ hours away and me being busy with college.

She could be really nice to me when I showed her my art and told her how school was going. I even used to confide to her about how hard it is for having to live at home with my emotionally immature and controlling parents

I started noticing problems whenever I would post anything on my social media, she would text me right after seeing it and tell me things she found wrong with what I posted. I’ve told her I have no interest in becoming an influencer like she does, and I know college isn’t always for everyone, but she’s always telling me “don’t you want to get so good at social media that you won’t even need school anymore?” I’m pretty low key on social media like I’ll post a picture of my coffee even if the background is just the coffee shop parking lot, but she keeps telling me not to post anything unless I run it by her. 

Things started really bothering me when I would reach out to her to seek support about stress from college or my home life, and she starting telling me that she can’t entertain any negativity at all because it doesn’t align with her goals of making it big as an influencer. She told me that me choosing to get a degree in order to later build a career is a much smaller destiny than hers. When I expressed frustration about my mother refusing to communicate with me, my friend said I should acknowledge that I’m the problem for being upset and childish all the time and nobody wants to put up with that 


Yes, I do have depression and anxiety that affects my mood and outlook, but I still found her comments to be really hurtful. At the same time, I’m aware that I have difficulty making friends so maybe her harshness is just something I’ll have to deal with if I want to keep a friend around. It’s not like I can probably do any better, believe me I’ve tried. Yeah I see other young people who have friends they enjoy spending time with or seek support from, but maybe I’m just incapable of finding that. I remember around last week I was so close to just breaking down and crying and when I texted my friend that I was in a bad place needing someone to talk to she just sent me a screenshot of her notifications saying she had more important things to look at. 


Everyone says to reach out to others for help, but when I do I’m pushed away and told I’m the problem. Yeah I see other young people who have good friends they enjoy spending time with or seek support from, but maybe I’m just incapable of finding that and should take what I can get

I remember being maybe 10 and wondering why I looked different than everyone else. I wondered why my siblings looked different than me. I wondered why my mom would call me names. I didn't want to be like that. Everyone wants to be normal, accepted. Sometimes I felt not worthy of love.

I remember desperately trying to figure out how to lose weight. Commercials about weight loss and health class were my entire understanding of our bodies and weight. It consumed me.

It wasn't until I was 12 that I learned that it doesn't only matter what you eat, but how much.

I remember staying at my dads house for the weekend and challenging myself to only drink juice. I did it. I felt awful. Yet, there's a special kind of accomplishment you get from deprivation. You feel better than those around you, like your mind is stronger. I got  back to my moms and felt dizzy. My first hunger pains. I ate a bagel and felt as though I walked 100 steps in the wrong direction. That everything I wanted for myself was unattainable. 

It wasn't until a year later that I first purged. I had spent a year obsessing about weight loss and working out. Progress wasn't easily made back then. I would break so easily and binge.

It's odd how parents seem to pass their eating disorders to their children. I've always felt judged by my mom. She is prideful.

Fast forward to 15. I had joined some programs at school in which I made friends who loved fitness and health. I started going to the gym every day. I think I weighed about 180 pounds back then. I'm 5' 9"". I would take photos of myself and just tear myself to shreds.

I found some forums that detailed how to lose weight. CICO. I got serious. I would wake up at 4 or so to run. I would fast for as long as I physically could. Lots of black coffee and youtube eating challenges.

I think I dropped down to about 130 lbs by the time I was 16. People noticed. Girls noticed. I loved the attention. This is what I had always wanted. But after so much time spent obsessing over my your image, you can always find something you don't like about yourself.

My weight changed with the times, I would swing between about 170 and 130 lbs over the next few years. Lots of binging, lots of deprivation.

Im not sure what I hope to accomplish with this post. I've always wanted to just start posting whatever was on my mind. Now I guess I can do that.

I'm 22 now, I've been in therapy for my relationship with food over the years. Every time I feel like I'm getting better something happens in my life that makes me slip back into old habits.

I've gone through a breakup recently. I let it consume me. I'm back in hell.

Why do I do this to myself

Control I guess.

I think I'm usually a better writer than this but I just woke up after drinking all night. I puked 5 or 6 times last night.

Maybe I'm just spiraling.

My friend invited me over to play some guitar. I'm gonna do that now. I regret this post already. I'm going to need to rewrite it when I'm in my mind.",2,1732416395.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

**When:** August 23–27, 2024  
**Who/Why:** My friend and I attending a mutual friend’s wedding (not at Four Seasons)  
**Room Type:** Golden Oak View Room  
**Booking Method:** FSPP (I've used Nick at Live Luxe Travel Co.)

[Four Seasons Orlando at Walt Disney World](https://preview.redd.it/up07v28mhr2e1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8d10e91a18df34746a65263a1efb74188e1a870)

**Service: 10/10**

The service at this property was impeccable from start to finish. Months before our stay, the concierge team was extremely helpful in planning and accommodating our needs. Despite the large size of the property (443 rooms), I always felt welcomed back by staff members, which added a personalized touch to our experience. Special shoutout to the housekeeping team! I scheduled housekeeping and turn-down services through the app, timing them during breakfast and dinner on our non-park days. They consistently completed the service without fail, even with 443 rooms!) I also appreciated the thoughtful postcards left at turn-down. The poolside service was outstanding—attentive and accommodating without being intrusive.

**Property: 10/10**

The property is stunning and located within the beautiful Golden Oak community. The landscaping is meticulously maintained; throughout the day, staff could be seen trimming bushes, planting flowers, and keeping everything spotless.

The pools, including the lazy river, was a big highlight. The spa is expansive, featuring an outdoor hot tub and a spacious co-ed relaxation room. While we didn’t use the dedicated kid and teen areas, they looked impressive and well thought-out for families.

[Lazy River](https://preview.redd.it/upwbh9d5hr2e1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=49bca7471e883140969fed57b3654723eec269a1)

**Room: 10/10**

Our Golden Oak View Room was spectacular. We used the pull-out bed, which the housekeeping team set up every night. The room was spacious and comfortable, with the added bonus of no minibar—no overpriced snacks and drinks cluttering the space (they were instead located elsewhere at each restaurant lol)!  Our view included the Golden Oak residences, the parking lot, and some nearby construction. While not ideal, it didn’t bother us since we were only in the room during mornings and evenings. We also had a construction view credit, which was more than made up! If I had to nitpick, the barn-style bathroom door isn’t my favorite. It’s trendy, but for a family-oriented property, a door with more privacy would be better.

**Food: 9/10**

The food across the property was fantastic, with Capa standing out as my favorite dining experience. Here’s a quick rundown of the options we tried:

* **Capa:** The signature rooftop restaurant. The dessert was especially memorable—absolutely delicious! I don't remember what it was, but picture below (lol).
* **Ravello:** Offers a breakfast buffet or à la carte options in the morning and serves Italian cuisine in the evening. Both were great. This is also where they have the Goofy breakfast once or twice a week.
* **Lickety Split:** A coffee and ice cream (gelato?) shop. The macarons are a must-try!
* **PB&G:** Perfect for lunch. My friend loved the fish tacos, and I enjoyed the popcorn shrimp (a starter that easily works as a meal).
* **Plancha:** Unfortunately, we didn’t get a chance to try this one.

[Dessert at Capa](https://preview.redd.it/iwu18vbwgr2e1.jpg?width=3454&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa037899072048722a42dd14b190a16567ea6574)

**Overall Experience**

This was a spectacular stay. As someone who has always stayed at Disney-owned properties, I was initially hesitant about the lack of constant on-site park transportation. However, the motorcoach service was reliable and convenient, with regular stops at all four parks. I’d return to the Four Seasons Orlando in a heartbeat—even for a trip focused entirely on the parks.

**Tips**

**1. Plan for park transportation:** The motorcoach service works well, but if you're rope-dropping a park, consider using Uber/Lyft for more control over your timing. Just factor in a little extra time for drivers to navigate the entrance process.

**2. Maximize breakfast credits:** If you have leftover breakfast credits or want a quick bite before heading to the parks, stop by Lickety Split (opens at 6:30 a.m.) for grab-and-go items. These can be stored in your room fridge for later.

**3. Book with a Four Seasons Preferred Partner:** I've used Nick at Live Luxe Travel and him and his team are spectacular!

-------------------------------------------------------------------

When living in a small space, maximizing your surroundings is essential. A wall away loveseat recliner is an excellent choice for compact living areas, offering comfort, versatility, and style without overcrowding your room. This type of loveseat recliner is designed to fit snugly against the wall while providing ample seating and relaxation options. Here are some notable benefits of incorporating a wall away loveseat recliner in your small space.

### Space Efficiency

One of the most significant advantages of a wall away loveseat recliner is its space-saving design. Traditional recliners often require extra space for full reclining. The wall away model is specifically designed to be positioned close to the wall, making it ideal for smaller apartments or rooms. You can enjoy a comfortable seating arrangement without worrying about obstructing pathways or squeezing around furniture.

### Versatile Functionality

This style of recliner is not just a mere seating option; it also showcases multifunctionality. Many wall away loveseat recliners come with built-in storage solutions, such as hidden compartments or cup holders. This feature allows you to stow away essentials while keeping everything easily accessible. Whether you want to use it as a cozy reading nook or a place to unwind after a long day, its adaptability suits various activities.

Even in small spaces, comfort should never be compromised. A wall away loveseat recliner typically features cushioned seats, ergonomic support, and adjustable reclining positions. You can easily find a loveseat that meets your preferences for lumbar support and cushion firmness. After a busy day, sinking into a recliner that hugs your body can significantly enhance your relaxation experience.

### Stylish Design Options

There's no need to sacrifice style for space when choosing a wall away loveseat recliner. These recliners come in various materials, colors, and designs, allowing you to find the perfect match for your decor. Whether you prefer a contemporary leather look or a cozy fabric finish, you can easily integrate it with your interior design. A stylish loveseat not only serves a functional purpose but also acts as a statement piece in your room.

### Easy Installation and Mobility

Wall away loveseat recliners are generally lightweight and easier to move compared to traditional recliners. If you're someone who likes rearranging furniture often or planning to relocate, having a more mobile option can be a game-changer. Plus, setting it up is straightforward and doesn’t usually require professional help, which adds to its appeal for anyone living in a small or temporary space.

### Durability and Quality

Investing in quality furniture can save you money in the long run. Many wall away loveseat recliners are constructed from robust materials that enhance their durability. Keeping your loveseat in good condition is vital, especially in smaller spaces where wear and tear can happen more quickly. Look for a recliner that comes with a warranty, as this can also reassure you about its longevity.

### Consideration of Size and Dimensions

Before purchasing a wall away loveseat recliner, always measure your space. The beauty of these recliners lies in their ability to fit snugly against the wall. Knowing the dimensions will help you find a loveseat that provides comfort without overwhelming your space. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:

- **Measure your available space:** Ensure you account for any other furniture and walking paths.
- **Check the recliner dimensions:** Confirm both the width and height to avoid unexpected surprises.
- **Think about the reclining position:** Make sure there is enough clearance for the recliner to extend fully.

Here, you’ll discover some effective ways to integrate a wall away loveseat recliner into your living room design.

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/wall-away-loveseat-recliner  
  
### Choose the Right Position

The first step in styling your living room with a wall away loveseat recliner is to select the perfect spot. Since these recliners are designed to be placed close to the wall, consider the following points:

- **Space Availability:** Measure the space in your living room to ensure the loveseat fits comfortably without crowding the area.
- **Viewing Angle:** Position the recliner for optimal viewing of your TV or fireplace. The angle should allow for a relaxed posture without neck strain.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure there’s enough room to fully recline without obstruction. Your guests should easily move around the furniture.

### Complementary Furniture Arrangement

Once you have the perfect position, think about how it can work with other pieces of furniture. A well-balanced layout is key for a cohesive look:

- **Pair with a Sofa:** A loveseat recliner pairs nicely with a traditional sofa. Choose fabrics and colors that complement each other for a harmonious design.
- **Add Accent Chairs:** Include accent chairs that echo the color scheme or fabric choices. This creates balance and provides additional seating options.
- **Coffee Tables:** Place a stylish coffee table in front of the loveseat. Opt for a design that matches the recliner—consider a wood finish or a chic glass table to maintain a modern look.

### Selecting the Right Fabric and Color

Choosing the right fabric and color for your wall away loveseat recliner can significantly affect your space. Here are some suggestions:

- **Color Coordination:** Decide on a color palette that complements your living room decor. Neutral colors like gray, beige, or taupe can create a serene atmosphere.
- **Bold Patterns:** If your living room leans towards a minimalist design, a wall away loveseat recliner in a bold pattern can serve as a stunning focal point.
- **Textural Harmony:** Consider the textures in your living room. A suede or leather recliner can add depth, especially when paired with soft, fluffy cushions.

### Accessorizing the Space

Accessorizing around your wall away loveseat recliner will enhance its appeal and functionality:

Check Details Here: https://loveseatreclinerguide.com/wall-away-loveseat-recliner

- **Artwork and Decor:** Consider wall art or decor items above and around the loveseat. This brings attention to the area, enhancing the overall atmosphere.

### Lighting Considerations

Lighting plays a crucial role in highlighting your wall away loveseat recliner:

- **Floor Lamps:** A sleek floor lamp next to the recliner can provide ample light for reading or relaxing.
- **Accent Lighting:** Use accent lights to spotlight the recliner. This not only draws attention but also creates warmth and ambiance.
- **Dimmer Switches:** Consider installing dimmer switches for your main lights. This allows you to adjust the brightness based on your activities or mood.

Hey there! I hope you’re having an amazing weekend and making the most of it. I’m here looking for something special: a genuine connection that’s both meaningful and fun, without the usual pressures or expectations. If you’re looking for a bond that’s as wholesome as it is exciting, we might just be a great match!

Picture this: we build a connection full of chemistry, laughter, and unforgettable moments. Whether it’s exploring scenic hiking trails, grabbing coffee at a cozy café, discovering hidden gems around the city, road-tripping to breathtaking spots, or camping under the stars; there’s no shortage of fun and adventure we could share.

A bit about me: I’m 27, easygoing, adventurous, uplifting, and someone who truly values meaningful conversations. My hobbies are pretty diverse: music, sports, fashion, photography, traveling, DJing, you name it, I’m probably into it or curious to try. I’m all about staying fit and active (I hit the gym 6 days a week), but I also prioritize mental health and creating balance in life. Oh, and I’m clean, ddf, and experienced, so you can feel at ease.

What I love most is learning about other cultures, hobbies, and perspectives; meeting new people always fascinates me. I’m open to starting off as friends or dating casually, letting things flow naturally, and seeing where it leads us. Whether we end up sharing great stories over coffee or creating lasting memories, it’s all about living life to the fullest.

If this sounds like the kind of vibe you’re into, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to get to know you better and see where this journey takes us! Let’s chat, vibe, and create something genuinely awesome together. Can’t wait to hear from you 😊

It has 2 sheets - Judges & Dishes. The judge sheet has the list of all the characters, their food preferences, as well as their favorite dish. I also added a simple search box where if you enter a character name, it will highlight their information on the list for you to take note of.

Once you have note of the judges and their preferences, you can move to the Dishes sheet. What I typically do is hide all the catagory rows that aren't in play. Then you can filter by Course and add up the projected scores to find the best outcome. You can easily doing this by just doing a sum of the category scores.

The sore throat and the mouth sores…I thought it would never end, and it hasn’t yet. This has been my experience with it as a working EBF mom:

(I will also state I also have a sinus infection with this, and had congestion the whole week before I realized I had HFM)

Day 1 - I had an ungodly headache in the middle of the night. Woke up drenched in sweat. No temp. Went back to sleep after taking some Tylenol. 

Day 2 - Got up and went to work. I was ungodly tired, but I always am (my baby doesn’t like to sleep through the night and that’s ok). Got home and ate dinner. Developed a fever of 100. Took Tylenol and a shower. Went to bed. Woke up drenched again. More Tylenol. Back to sleep. I thought it was from my sinus infection. 

Day 3 - Woke up on my own super early. Drank coffee. Got a little energy. Took baby on a walk. Fever came back. Knocked me out. Got home. Napped for 2 hours. (I never nap). Took covid test. Negative. Ate. Fever came back at 99. More Tylenol. Back to sleep. 

Day 4 - wake up and throat is killing me. Popped cough drops all day. Still think it’s from sinus infection drainage. I mostly lived life as normally as possible just with a throat that is on fire. Bed time I remember telling my husband “my mouth is on fire” sleep. No fever. No chills. Body aches start. My tongue got like “fuzzy”. I don’t know another way to explain it. 

Day 5 - Woke up and went to work. Wore a mask just in case. Went to little clinic during break. God antibiotic for sinus infection. I kept telling the doctor “my throat hurts so bad that my mouth is on fire.” Strep test negative. He tells me not to go to work for a day and try to sleep the next day. I got home and nap. We take baby to doctor for checkup. We leave there and my hands start breaking out. By the time we get home my feet feel like needles are stabbing my feet. The pain between the toes was rough. 

Day 6 -  I wake up with what feels like lie bumps all over my tongue. I’m texting friends saying this isn’t just a sinus infection. What if this is HFM. So I go back to Little Clinic and she diagnosed me With HFM. No more fever. Throat is burning. She gives me some lidocaine mouth wash and tells me good luck. 

Days 7-9 - mouth is on fire. Ulcers everywhere. Roof of mouth has red sores all over. Each day more pop up. They were all over my tongue, gums, roof of mouth, inside my lips, and the back of my throat. I had probably 15 under my tongue. Like I said MISERABLE. Throat is still on fire. I can hardly eat. Cold soup and apple sauce became that only thing I could get down. 

Day 10 - no more sore throat. Mouth pain is still horrible. More sores. Every now and then I get a sharp pain in the side of my throat. Ice water is saving me. 

Day 11 - woke up with new sores in my mouth. Tongue is so swollen from all the sores. It’s miserable to eat, but I force myself bc I’m still EBF my baby and have to make sure he is getting what he needs. Water. Water. Water. Mouth rinse helps in very short bursts. I usually save it for when the pain gets excruciating. No more rash on hands. 

Day 12 (today) - spitting blood from the mouth sores when I brush my teeth. About the same as yesterday. I’m not at tired today as I have been for almost 3 weeks now. Mouth feels swollen from everything. Salt water rinse burns like the devil but I push through. Tongue feels fuzzy again. Lips are burning. Not sure if it’s bc they are chapped or if they are about to break out in sores. Stay tuned. Mouth is still really swollen. I keep praying I wake up tomorrow able to eat normally. 


How’d I get it? It had to be from my baby. I don’t think I realized. He got a mild fever and diarrhea about a week before my day 1. He got a diaper rash the next day. He’s also cutting 4 teeth, so I assumed it was all related to teething. Hindsight. I bet it was HFM. 


I wanted to share my experience for those who may be 7 days in with no end in sight. Progress is progress. The mouth was the worst part for me!  I don’t think my supply has been affected by HFM other than I’m just not drinking as much water. I have steroids I could take, but with me EBF I don’t want to risk it. I’d rather power through than risk it. ",7,1732414908.0,beyondthebump,1,0.9,False

My husband wants sex literally 1000000 times a day. ,1,1732414771.0,Healthyhooha,6,1.0,False

Living and working in Australia, always felt that be it to start the day or half way through work, that cuppa to really kick things off or calm things down is ESSENTIAL to the work week and even the weekend. 

What's your go to sachet coffee ? Not everyone gets that fancy shamcy coffee machine throughout the work week but what's that one little sachet you pull out and smile at when that hot kettle clicks off and that scalding pour rushes into your personal cup? 

Mines the Green Moccona Strong Cappuccino. Not too acidic, not too bitter and has the froth to fight any barista made cap. ✌️✌️✌️",11,1732414704.0,perth,60,0.69,False

I know the coffee setup might look confusing. I have two separate conveyor lines running which meet in the middle. I did this so the folks at the end of the line don't have to wait as long to get served. ",1,1732414553.0,PlateUp,0,1.0,False
