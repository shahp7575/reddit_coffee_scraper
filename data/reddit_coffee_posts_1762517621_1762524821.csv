1oqvfhn,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1oqvfhn/why_do_i_always_feel_tired_during_the_day_but/,Why do I always feel tired during the day but full of energy at night?,"Hey everyone

I just realized I have a pretty big problem, and I really need to talk about it.. maybe some of you can help or relate.

No matter how many hours I sleep, when I wake up and see the sun out, I feel so sleepy or tired. My energy is always super low during the day. I just want to chill, relax, or even nap. But when night comes..  even if I haven’t slept for 24 hours.. I suddenly get this rush of energy. I feel alive, active, motivated, and I don’t even know why.

I think it started a few years ago when I had about three years of working and studying during the night. My whole lifestyle was built around the night, and I loved it. But this year, I’ve been forced to live a “normal” schedule.. awake during the day.. and I’m really struggling.

I’ve tried to fix my sleep routine: going to bed early, sleeping 6–7 hours, staying consistent for weeks… but it doesn’t seem to help. After two or three hours of being awake, I already feel tired again.

I even did full blood tests.. everything came back normal except for a slight vitamin D3 deficiency, which is common where I live. I’ve been taking vitamin D supplements for six months, but nothing’s changed.

I also tried drinking coffee 3–4 hours after waking up, but still.. I feel mentally tired during the day. Physically I can work and function, but my brain just feels like it wants to sleep.

Has anyone else experienced this? What could be the reason? Is it purely psychological or something deeper with circadian rhythm or hormones? I’d really love to hear your thoughts or if anyone managed to fix this.",1,1762524673.0,sleep,0,1.0,False
1oqvexg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oqvexg,Type me based on my outfits/expressions and what I’ve saved from Pinterest:),"My hobbies include writing fiction, reading about neurology/psychology, spending time in nature, listening to music, playing video games like Minecraft, sky children of light, and call of duty.

What I find comfort in is creating a clean space. My routines, such as drinking coffee every morning, and taking a nap daily if I have time. I love naps, it’s like a total reset.. even if in the evening 😅. I love to light candles, love chamomile and lavender. If I am deeply upset, I write certain lyrics from music in an artistic matter, and I find that helps me to sort through my feelings. 

My recent emojis: 😂🥲🤣🩵😎😆😌😅💔😁☺️😇😀😜😭😄😊🕵️😍🥰💃🌱🙏🤳😋🩷💀🥹😩😝😏😛

My favorite colors are dusty pink, deep forest green, violet indigo, neon pink. 

I find excessive socializing tiring, even if I really enjoy the person. I find myself wanting to go home soon after a party😂. But I love analyzing people, I could spend all day studying the personalities of people and learning about how they are different from me, using this knowledge to identify their enneagram and MBTI. I love connecting with people I feel close to, like joking around with them and having deep talks, I can be very protective of the people I’m close to.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

So I 35M work in the hospitality industry as a bartender for a large town sports bar. Most of the time I love my job, you get bad days of course but you get good ones too.
Many of those good days revolve around a certain lady 21F coming in who always brings a smile to my face. She comes in with friends and sometimes her older brother who is a decent guy and easy to get along with. To make it easier, I'll call her ""Hannah"".
Hannah and I always chat and laugh and take the piss out of each other and it's easy to talk to her. I don't need to pretend.

Anyway. About 6 weeks ago, they asked me to join their table when I finished early and we all got properly talking. Had a great laugh and then Hannah's older brother turns round and goes ""have you heard the Bartender sing on the Karaoke nights here! He's phenomenal!"" And was bigging me up quite a bit around his sister and going on about how Hannah needed to come in with her friends to hear me sing but regretted he couldn't make it with them. 

She agreed and a few days later turned up with some friends for the karaoke night. 
And the look on her face when I got up to sing was just pure delight and I just thought... Wow! She's beautiful. 
That night she gave me her number and we got talking, a lot. Realized we had a lot in common and I really do mean a lot! Everything from music, films, books, life goals, animals, what we like to do on our days off, board games (we're both complete dorks) and things we've always wanted to do but hadn't because it's something best shared with another... 
And yeah, we started flirting a fair bit. 

The age gap did worry me at first but Hannah never had a problem with it so it just fell away. 
We went on our first date a week after we started messaging each other. It was just supposed to be a short coffee date at lunchtime to see if we really did get along without the messages...
Well, yes, we did and that lunch coffee date turned into 11 hours together just drinking coffee, playing games (arcade) laughing and just enjoying each other's company and parting at the end was so difficult for the both of us as we didn't want to leave.

Things got better after that. We'd hang out more, most of the time with her friends who are good people and really easy to get along with. 
But we'd struggle to find moments to spend alone together and wind up messaging late into the early hours. Still learning about each other and just making each other smile.

Date number 2 was so simple. It was just walking my dog along the beach. She's a massive animal person so loved the idea. 
I met her after she finished work quite late in the evening with my pup and we briefly popped into my work for some light food and a quiet drink together.
I'll just say it. My dog is fussy with people. He normally doesn't like them but he absolutely loved her and she fawned over him like he was a puppy. (He's an old boy now) 
And we walked along the beach and just enjoyed each others company. 
Now I'm not a small guy, I'm built like a bear. I keep myself in shape enough not to be lazy but I don't go out of my way to be crazy active but she got me and my doggo running. Actual full pelt running with wild abandon along the beach and loving every second of it. And I wanted to with her. 
She is active, like crazy in shape compared to me. But I held my own and it felt good.
We mucked about in a beach park, challenging each other, climbing, jumping and laughing. Trying to catch each other until we found ourselves out of breath sheltering out of the wind under one of the park structures where our conversations started to get deep. We spoke of our family and friends, what we wanted from an actual relationship and it was so easy to open up with her and she just smiled and cuddled into me.
I've dated a lot of people and I can normally tell at the start it's going to end badly. But in that moment with her, that simple moment. It felt right. 
And she agreed. 
We kissed and damn did it feel right. 
We walked most of the way back to mine holding hands and just talking about random stuff and it was the most at peace I'd ever felt with someone.
Parting again was even harder than before.
She wanted to keep things on the down low to do with her friends and family until they'd gotten used to me being around and I had no problem with that. She is what matters to me and I respect her wishes. 
We met up almost daily after that. 
Whether it be popping into each others workplaces to just see the other smile or I'd end up hanging out with her and her friends. Finding time alone around our lives was difficult so we stole every moment we could, anyway we could. 
She made me remember what living felt like and to see wonder in the world again and I haven't smiled this much in years.
Date number 3 was just a few days ago. We went to see the fireworks... We didn't see the fireworks 🤣 ended up going for dinner instead. She wound up meeting my mum by chance which was terrifying and yet they got along well.
Hannah and I headed back to mine and well... I'll leave that there.
Suffice to say date 3 went well and I'm completely smitten. Never felt like this about anyone before.

But all good things as they say.
Last night, her family found out. 
We were both at my workplace. Both with an evening off.
Her with her family and me for a co-workers party. 
I mixed between the two, talking with her aunt and uncle who are both lovely people while also partying with my coworkers and having a drink or two all while her and I were messaging back and forth making the night better. 

I had to leave with my group and Hannah and I quickly snuck off to steal a moment together away from everyone. 
But we got caught by her Aunt and... The night ended there for us both....
She understandably got spooked and went back to her family to try to explain and I got dragged off by coworkers to a party that had lost it's lustre. 

Now I'm worried for her and I don't know what to do.
I want to be with her and she wants to be with me by her own admission.
So to the people who made it this far.
If you were me, what would be your next step?

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I found him very attractive, and I think he did too, so we went for a coffee, talked, laughed, walked and went home. He said he would like to see me again, but I get this vibe that he's either shy or just not that interested. He's nice and all, payed for coffee and asked questions, made some eye contact and such, but he also seemed like he was unsure or rather ""testing out the field"" (which is obviously normal since we are still getting to know eachother). Either way, I sent him a meme and he deliberately replied something funny and just liked my last message. 

My question is, am I coming on too strong (I talked most of the time and initiated most of the contact) and is he just being nice in saying he wants to see me again but doesn't actually mean it? ",1,1762524313.0,Crushes,1,0.99,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I quit nicotine pouches/snus a while back after about 15 years of using them almost nonstop. I was at 1.5-2 cans a day, swapping a pouch every 20–40 minutes. Nicotine wasn’t really a habit anymore, it was the background rhythm of my entire day.

I always believed nicotine made me sharp. That it helped me think fast, switch tasks, stay engaged. Every time I tried to quit in the past, I felt like I was thinking slower or reacting slower, and that scared me back into using again.

But this time I understood what was actually happening. I wasn’t addicted to nicotine itself. I was addicted to the *pacing* it forced my brain and body into. Nicotine kept me slightly ahead of the moment, always leaning forward internally, anticipating instead of just being present. It felt like focus, but it was really tension disguised as clarity.

The real trap wasn’t craving nicotine, it was craving the *tempo* that nicotine created.

So instead of going cold turkey or using gum, I switched to a 21 mg patch. The patch gives a steady level with no spikes and no “rush.” When there are no spikes, there is no drop. When there is no drop, the brain doesn’t send the “where is my next pouch?” signal. Sure I'd still get the cue with morning coffee or after lunch, but those disappeared really fast. The craving loop never even really starts, so I can concentrate on observing them instead of substituting.

And once that pacing signal disappeared, something unexpected happened. I didn’t feel slow. I felt in sync with time again. My breathing dropped deeper. Conversations felt less rushed. Movement felt smoother (especially in the mornings). I wasn’t pushing myself through the day anymore. I was just in it.

The mental sharpness didn’t go anywhere. It just stopped being tied to internal tension. The clarity is still there, but it’s calm now, not forced.

I stayed on the 21 mg patch for 7 days, then moved to 14 mg for another 5, and then off once this steadier tempo felt fully natural. No rushing. No willpower war. Just letting my nervous system reset.

Funny thing is, I know I'm not going back to snus now that I see the full cost. Not the health cost, not the monetary cost but the cost of having something external pacing every moment of my life. Not having to think ""keys, wallet, phone, *nicotine"",* when I leave the house. Taking my time and being in the moment with my family and kids, not subconsciously pacing towards next action.",1,1762524146.0,nicotinefree,0,1.0,False

A quiet, intimate vignette about love, early mornings, and belonging.

[A4A][SFW][Established Relationship][Wholesome]

/ This is my first time writing something like this. So if there are many issues, please point them out generously!
/ It doesn't belong to just some people—it belongs to ""us""! My original intention was to make anyone who reads this feel relaxed, safe, and cared for.

——

You came before the winter did. I think that's a genuine love confession. You truly did arrive before the cold.

I have a lover. I love you so much.

As always, I wake in the pre-dawn hours. You are lying beside me, turned away, breathing steadily. I shift closer, pressing against you. I press soft kisses to your earlobe, your neck, the curve of your back. In response, you curl tighter into my embrace, then turn over to face me, nuzzling deeper into my chest.

I ruffle your hair softly, gently pat your back, and whisper close to your ear, ""I'm here, darling. I'm holding you. Go back to sleep.""

You, still hazy with dreams, plant a soft kiss on my chin. I can't help a quiet chuckle. It's unbearably sweet. I love you so much—the faint flutter of your eyelashes, the gentle rise and fall of your chest... I take it all in.

Outside the window, the world is a sheet of grey. A mist, mingled with rain, drips softly onto the earth. It's a soothing sound, but you are my true solace. And so, I settle in beside you and drift back into a light sleep.

When I wake again, the world outside has settled into a quiet calm, broken only by the occasional chirp of a bird. I make sure you are comfortable and place a kiss on your forehead.

I make us a cup of coffee and prepare your favorite breakfast. I know you'll love it. After setting the table, I pick a book from the shelf and return to your side, waiting for you to wake.

The cold of the season, and the warmth of you.
Your embrace, your kisses—they make me feel happy, they make me feel safe.

I love you.

The roar tore through the cavern again, closer, vibrating through the stone beneath Caleb's feet. Dust cascaded from heights above. Whatever made that sound was massive, and it was moving. Fast.

*Run!*

He spun on his heel, his only thought to flee back through the tunnel he’d come from, back toward the memory of sunlight. 

Heavy footfalls thundered from the darkness behind him, each impact a drumbeat of raw mass slamming into stone. They were close. Too close. The sound built with terrifying speed—a freight train of muscle and bone hurtling through the black.

Caleb pulled, panicking as he tried to concentrate Stamina into his legs for a desperate **\[Dash\]** toward the tunnel. The energy began to pool, his muscles coiling with compressed power—

A displacement of air rushed into his back, a wash of fetid heat and the stench of rot so thick he tasted it.

*Crumb!*

He threw himself sideways in a graceless dive, releasing the Stamina before he could use it. Claws shrieked through the space where his head had been a heartbeat before. The sheer force of the creature's passing sent him tumbling, his shoulder slamming into the cavern floor. He rolled, came up in a crouch, his spear somehow still in his grip.

His perception beam snapped toward the threat on full blast, pushing through this extra complication and everything beyond. A gargantuan obstruction filled the cavern. The creature's aura blazed a nauseating crimson-black that felt of crushing rock and tasted of the grave. Its core nature felt so deeply repulsive, Caleb's gorge rose.

His perception struggled to resolve the spatial fuzz, finally locking onto its horrifying scale. The mass had the general structure of a goblin, but magnified—a dense concentration of power that pulsed over eight feet high at its apex. Four limbs extended from the central mass, ending in what his perception registered as sharp, dangerous points. The appendage that had to be its head swiveled, and its entire vicious intent narrowed, drilling into him like a spike.

The creature shifted position with deliberate, calculated movements, angling its colossal bulk to block the tunnel mouth. Each step was purposeful, patient. It wasn't trying to kill him yet. It was making sure he couldn't run.

Then it charged.

Caleb's body reacted before his mind could process the danger this time. He channeled Stamina through his legs, the energy surging from every cell in a systemic draw. The power concentrated, compressed, then he exploded away. **\[Dash\]** carried him to the left in a blur of motion.

A sound like grinding boulders erupted where he'd been standing, as its talons scored deep gouges into the ground. A heavy tremor pulsed up from the stone, rattling into the soles of his boots.

Its head snapped toward him with preternatural quickness. It lunged again. He perceived the head-mass elongate as its maw opened wide. A wave of carrion-stench, hot and suffocating, washed over him. Caleb triggered another **\[Dash\]**, this time backward. Heat seared through his legs as the Stamina discharge left his muscles burning. The technique wasn't meant for repeated use—each activation was a controlled detonation that built up damage in its wake.

His back hit a stalagmite. The beast's teeth snapped shut inches from his face, but he rolled right, the creature's follow-up swipe missing by a hair's breadth.

*Can't keep this up! Two dashes and my legs are already cramping!*

Caleb's Stamina reserves were plummeting. Each full-power **\[Dash\]** was a fire hose blasting at a thimble-sized problem, and he'd need every scrap of energy to survive this. There had to be another way.

He recalled his initial tries at the technique before mastering the correct form. That shorter, incomplete burst where he'd failed to maintain the energy thread through the entire movement. They'd been failures then, but...

The creature feinted left, then struck right. Instead of a full **\[Dash\]**, Caleb channeled a fraction of the Stamina, releasing it almost immediately. The result was a two-yard hop backward—sufficient to avoid the worst of the strike, though the beast's claws still scraped his cuirass, failing to penetrate.

*Less distance, but lower cost. And I can control the direction better.*

He began incorporating the abbreviated dashes into his movement pattern. A quick hop left to avoid snapping jaws. A backward skip to dodge a backhand swipe that would have shattered his ribs. The micro-movements let him stay mobile without destroying his legs or depleting his reserves as quickly.

The creature snarled, and its assault grew wilder, as if it were confounded by prey that refused to hold still.

Then it shifted position, aligning itself perfectly between Caleb and the cavern's far end. His perception beam, still panic-blasting at full power, exposed what was beyond.

A yawning void gaped in the far wall, an opening easily fifteen yards across. The ground in front of the opening made Caleb's blood freeze. His perception registered a cluttered, uneven floor, littered with countless small, hard shapes. They were piled in drifts, scattered like debris. The sheer number of them, and the faint odor of decay coming from that part of the cavern, painted a horrifying picture. *Bones. A graveyard of them.*

He remembered the creature hadn't come from that direction, and a terrifying truth settled in. This cavern wasn't this monster's personal den. He'd stumbled into a shared space, littered with carrion like some apex predator's buffet table. And judging by the sheer size of that dark opening, the thing he was fighting wasn't necessarily the biggest predator here.

The intense pressure behind his eyes snapped him back to the immediate danger. He was wasting massive amounts of Mana, his perception beam blazing past his target to map useless stone.

He throttled the beam back immediately, narrowing its focus to just the creature's body. The elongated spatial beam vanished, replaced by a simpler awareness of the creature's position and movement. A dull, lingering ache replaced the stabbing pain behind his eyes, and his thoughts cleared of the mental static. The Mana drain slowed, but the state of the reservoir in his core made one thing very clear: he was running out of time.

*Stupid! Wasteful! Gone for nothing! Stupid, stupid—focus!*

The creature circled, and Caleb matched its movement, keeping his damaged left side away from those claws. Time to go on the offensive. He couldn't dance forever.

He waited for an opening—the brief moment when the creature shifted its weight to change direction. His **\[Breaching Thrust\]** lashed out, aimed for a point of articulation he perceived in its forward limb.

The spear tip caught something incredibly dense and skittered off harmlessly. The jarring impact sent painful vibrations up his arms.

It twisted, presenting a section of its upper torso toward him and pulling back its arms. When he tried another thrust, aiming for its flank, the creature simply angled its body so the spear met what felt like an impenetrable mass on its chest.

*Is… is it learning? This is bad.*

His next attack confirmed it. The creature not only positioned itself to deflect his spear but used the momentum of his thrust against him. As he extended for the strike, it stepped into it, letting the spear slide along its armor while bringing its head around for a snap at his exposed arm.

Only a desperate micro-**\[Dash\]** saved him from losing the limb.

Worse, the creature was adapting its tactics. Instead of charging blindly, it began using the environment. It ignored him, turning to the cavern wall and raking it with its huge claws. Rock groaned and splintered. A cascade of falling masses registered in his perception. He heard the whistle of their descent and the heavy thud as they impacted the floor around him. Caleb had no choice but to waste a precious burst of Stamina on an unplanned **\[Dash\]** to avoid being crushed.

His confidence cracked. The smaller goblins had been manageable. Their auras were thin, fragile things that barely registered as Low-Red in his perception. This creature felt different. Its spiritual signature pressed down on him like magnified gravity, thick and smothering. *High-Red.* He'd never perceived any beast so deeply saturated in the Body Triad at his tier. The thing must have been hunting in these caves for years, and every moment showed it.

The creature’s testing lunges ceased. With a roar that shook more dust from the ceiling, it abandoned patience for a full-bodied assault. Caleb tried to **\[Dash\]** left, but his placement among the stalagmites limited his options. The creature had planned this.

He managed a partial dodge, but a claw caught him anyway. The impact lifted him off his feet and hurled him against a stalagmite. His pack's contents helped cushion the collision, but his cuirass, already damaged from the earlier fights, split like paper. A tearing impact ripped through his side. A trio of distinct, searing pains carved deep as claws found flesh.

Caleb hit the ground hard. A hot, wet sensation spread instantly from the wound, a terrifyingly rapid flow of his own life. He pressed his hand to the cuts, feeling their depth. Not immediately fatal, but bad. Terrible.

*Can't run anymore. Can barely stand.*

He dragged himself backwards, away from his tormentor. Its approach turned leisurely, almost casual. Why rush when your prey was cornered and bleeding out?

Caleb's beam tracked its movement as it stalked wide, cutting off any escape route. It was backing him into a corner of the cavern, pinning him to the unknown pit. Behind him, the vast, dark opening to the boneyard gaped like an open grave, a constant, terrifying presence at his back. The creature was simply trapping him, but the location made his skin crawl. He was being crushed between an immediate threat and the potential of a far greater one.

*No.* Caleb struggled back to his feet.

His defiance triggered a cascade of memories—Katie at her soccer game, hair in a ponytail, her face a mask of fierce concentration. Jack holding up a drawing, his smile proud and serious. Evelynn’s sleepy grin over morning coffee. He had chosen **\[Perfect Memory\]** to preserve them. He *would not* let them be erased.

The tactical choice became an emotional vow. A raw, hard certainty settled in his heart, displacing the fear.

*I didn't lose everything just to die in this cave!*

The memory shifted—his legs overloading with Stamina during training in the forest. The sensation of holding too much power, feeling his muscles tear under the strain. He'd released it then, terrified of the damage.

But damage could be a price worth paying.

The creature came then, a slowly building charge to finally end its wounded prey. Caleb had one chance. His normal thrusts couldn't penetrate that hide, not with his current strength. He needed more power. Much more.

As the beast closed the distance, Caleb *pulled*. A desperate, systemic drain of each drop of Stamina he could muster. The energy flooded in from every corner of his body.

He channeled it all into his arms, shoulders, and back. Then, violating every rule of safe energy manipulation he knew of, he held it there.

His muscles screamed. It was the feeling of his own frame tearing itself apart from the inside out; the cells burning with a strength they were never meant to contain this long. His body was a drum, stretched taut, ready to burst. He held the energy, a human bomb about to explode.

Holding it was an agony he hadn't felt since being thrust into this world, but he refused to yield.

The creature was five yards away. Three. Its jaws opened wide enough to take his head off. The world seemed to slow, the creature's advance turning into a series of distinct, horrifying snapshots.

*Now!*

Caleb thrust with everything: the Stamina, his will, his rage, his desperate need to survive. The spear moved faster than thought, faster than anything he'd managed before. The overloaded Stamina transferred from his ravaged muscles into the spear shaft, turning the simple iron tip into something more.

The attack met the creature's charge head-on.

The spear tip didn't just pierce. It detonated. The uncontrolled force punched through the creature's armored hide, ripping through bone and muscle. A gout of steaming fluid erupted from the creature's far side, and the stench of blood and viscera filled the air.

The kinetic force of the blow was undeniable. Not only was the creature's forward charge stopped; it was violently reversed. The beast’s immense body lifted from its feet and hurled backward through the air, ripping the spear from Caleb's grip. It crashed against the cavern floor five yards away with a wet, final thud.

The recoil was just as brutal. A sickening crack resounded in the cavern as the unrestrained energy slammed back into his right arm. Bones shattered from the wrist to the elbow. A scream of pure agony was torn from his throat.

He staggered back, his vision whiting out from the pain. The Stamina overload’s fierce backlash surged through him. It was the searing cramp from his failed **\[Dash\]** experiments, but a dozen times worse, consuming his entire upper body. The muscles in his arms and back felt like they had been seared to the bone, leaving behind a deep, spasming ache. His legs, scoured of their last reserves to fuel the attack, trembled violently and threatened to give way. The warm, slick flow from the wounds in his side intensified, and every breath was a hot agony. But he did not fall.

Caleb forced his legs to lock, planting his feet on the stone floor. He stood there, swaying, in the sudden silence. His right arm hung uselessly at his side, a broken ruin. Blood dripped from his torn flesh, forming a small pool at his feet. He was bleeding out, disarmed, and barely remained conscious. But he was alive. And he was standing.

*Did it,* he thought, the words a faint whisper in the storm of his pain. *Killed it. Now just…*

A scraping sound came from across the cavern. Then another. The distinctive note of claws on stone.

With the last dregs of his Mana, Caleb sent out a final, wavering perception pulse. The remaining goblins were creeping forward from various tunnel entrances. Three of them. They moved cautiously, aware the larger beast was dead but unsure if its killer still posed a threat.

They kept their distance, postures a mix of hunger and caution.

Caleb watched their spatial signatures advance. His spear lay somewhere in the darkness near the corpse. He couldn't properly wield the knife at his belt with a shattered arm and spasming left hand. He couldn't run. All he could do was stand his ground and watch them come.

The scraping grew closer.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This post is probably something I wished I read when I got started with beer brewing 5 years ago.

Session beers also shorten a lot a brew day:

\- 30 min mash at 70C / 158F to keep a decent body

\- No sparge (most of the time, efficiency isn't the goal here)

\- 30 min boil

\--> From weighting my grains to the end of the clean up, it's about 3h. 

The workflow can be a bit different depending on what you want to achieve but I make most beers following that process.

Now to the recipe! I am very pleased with that sweet stout, it tastes like a mix of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and oat latte. The mouthfeel is rich but not cloying. If I had to guess, I would say that it is a 5% ABV beer.

For a 12L /3.2 gal batch:

1.06kg / 2.3lbs extra pale maris otter 43,8%

275g / 9,7oz low colour chocolate malt 11,4%

270g / 9,5oz naked oat malt 11,2%

270g / 9,5oz flaked oats 11,2%

230g / 8.1oz lactose 9,5%

185g / 6.5oz medium crystal 240 7,6%

90g / 3,2oz rice hull 3,7%

40g / 1.4oz midnight wheat 1,7%

Mashed 30 min at 70C/158F

  
Hops: 

30' Northern brewers 20 IBUs

Balanced water profile

S-04 yeast, fermented at 17C / 63F

OG: 1,042

FG: 1,023

2.5% ABV

60 EBC

20 IBU / BU:GU 0,49

Fermentation was done in 48h, let it sit 5 more days, kegged it, carbonated at 12 PSI and served through a stout spout.

I found that crystal 240 gives a strong perceived sweetness and many session beers I make have some. Lactose of course provides some sweetness and the oats actually give a silky mouthfeel: for once the contribution of the oat is very obvious. Finally, I chose a lighter roasted malt and midnight wheat that doesn't have husks. Keeping the roastiness in balance is important in session beers. I made that mistake before and the beer was just bitter / burnt coffee.

I have another daughter who left the house after she got married. My youngest Sara has the whole floor to herself (for about 1 year now), before she shared with her sister. The floor has a full bathroom, office, Sara's room and her sisters room which is now Sara's. She has her excess clothes in that room and uses it as storage. The room still has a twin bed though. You could find Sara till 3am in her office studying and get up at 7am to study. She has good grades, but she pays for it with her social life. She never sits at the table, always eats in her office while watching her lectures over again. She goes out maybe once in 2/3 months. We tried to make that floor really hers so she'd feel home. She has a tv in her room a twin bed, she barely watches the TV though. She doesn't really help with the household, but she keeps her floor clean and tidy. If she has time she loves to cook and bake.

we are having guests over for a 2 weeks, 2 adults 2 kids (3 and 9). The guest room on our floor only has one twin bed. And we put the adults in the room next to Sara. Sara didn't like it and she says it makes her space feel invaded but we don't have another room and it would be inappropriate to let them sleep in the living room when we have an empty room. My guest came to me and said that she heard walking sounds coming from Sara's in the middle of the night as she gets down to get coffee and it was annoying. She said that she was very sensitive and couldn't sleep. I offered to change her room and put the kids upstairs her and her husband downstairs. She said ""no my kids are young I don't want them all the way up here"". I talked to Sara about it and she got annoyed but said she'd be more careful.

2 days later my guest said that she heard Sara watch TV at 2am and it was annoying. I asked Sara and she said ""I was tired and watched my last lecture class on the tv"". I asked her not to do that and she sighted but said ok. The day after she left earlier than usual at 4am I called her and she said she'd go to the uni library (which is open 24/7) and to college after. I told her she should've helped me with breakfast and she hung up. I get that she is studying, but I can't have all 4 guests by myself. My husband isn't supportive at all and he is the one who invited them.

That same night Sara stayed up till 7am to study and she fell asleep on her desk. But apparently even the sounds of her typing can be hear from the room Nextdoor as it it so empty and silent at night. I asked Sara if she could just stop pulling all nighters for a while and study throughout the day. She said she'd try but she goes to school till 6pm almost every day and it just takes up all night to do all of the work properly.

Yesterday I asked Sara to cook dinner and she said ""I have to study I have an exam coming up"". Her exam is in 1 week and I told her she wouldn't die if she didn't study for one night. She flipped at me and said that I am trying to withhold her from studying which is not true.

The two perfumes I own are:
- Gabrielle by Chanel (eau de Parfum) my everyday perfume, I love it to death
- Allure, the yellow/gold one (eau de toilette)

What I’m looking for: fruity, flowery, fresh, citrusy also open to heavier woodier or herbal (is this correct English?) perfumes but not too sweet. And here comes the problem. My skin turns almost everything into willy wonkas wildest dreams. So so much pulls too sweet on me. Here’s a list of perfumes I didn’t like:

- J’adore (absolutely HATE this. Smells like air fresheners for cars imo)
- Her, Burberry 
- Paradoxe, Prada (all varieties)
- Chance, Chanel (all varieties)
- the other varieties of allure, Chanel
- 724, Maison Francis Kurkdjian (a very sweet sales lady recommended it bc it’s unisex but still pulled to sweet)
- Rouge 540, Maison Francis Kurkdjian
- Bal d’ afrique, byredo 
- Blanche, Byredo 
- Rose Noir, Byredo
(- there are a lot more but I forgot to write them down sadly) 

I’m a bit confused and unsure where to start because on paper I should like most of them. I’m not opposed to smell my way through, but I feel like I need a better starting point. Thank you for your help!!

Also I’m somewhat limited in my access to quite popular perfumes or samples, bc I don’t live in a very big city.

(Even more background info)
Smells I enjoy naturally are:
- jasmine 
- lavender 
- lilac
- all citrus fruits
- coffee
- wet grass
- the street after rain
- rosmary
- basil 
- thyme 
- mint
- fir and spruce trees

Alone in an IHOP at 3AM - Coffee carafe brought and left at the table. I drank my coffee black, had some hash browns and sobered up. In hindsight it feels like a great option for this kinda thing.
2. Waiting room at the mental health clinic - that’s why everyone is there. 
3. Christmas tree farm - don’t you ever get sad about cutting down a tree just so it can twinkle for your frivolous enjoyment?
4. Middle school bathroom - A rite of passage
5. Dropping off an old fling at the airport - he was Swiss and said “Why do you WHINE?!?! We will see each other again.” Which was a lie, btw.

9001. New Moms Support Group: Oh, did you think people are actually going to this thing for support? 

HAHA no fool, they are there to talk all about how hard it is to have such an amazing milk supply, how their newborn is SUCH a bad sleeper - she gets up TWICE a night, and how worried they are because their little angel once looked at them like they were possibly thinking about crying — and could this mean that they are a bad mom? Needless to say, I missed the memo.

My general opinion about crying in public? Negative. Don’t believe the hype. Not once have my tears touched the heart of a rich, handsome stranger!!

Crying alone on my bed into a soft pillow will always be THE way to go for me and I cannot be convinced otherwise, so don’t even try.",17,1762523374.0,pinkscare,2,1.0,False

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1oqusrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSpinMedia/comments/1oqusrx/scientists_build_worlds_first_artificial_tongue/,👅 Scientists build world’s first artificial tongue Explore the future 👇,"Researchers have developed an artificial “tongue” that can detect and learn flavours in liquid environments, mimicking human taste-bud functions. This device, built with ultra-thin graphene-oxide membranes, managed to identify simple tastes with 72–88% accuracy and more complex drinks like coffee or cola with about 96% accuracy. 

What makes it exciting is that the system not only senses taste, but “learns” from repeated exposures — a kind of neuromorphic computing applied to flavour detection. Unlike previous sensors that required an external computer, this tongue processes data internally in a liquid medium, a breakthrough for robotics, food safety, and potentially medical diagnostics. 

The team behind the research say this could lead to new kinds of machines capable of “tasting” for disease-markers in bodily fluids, or monitoring beverage quality in real time on production lines. While still a prototype and somewhat bulky/power-hungry today, the work suggests a future where machines don’t just see or hear, but taste and learn. 

For readers: Imagine your smartphone tasting your coffee and alerting you if it’s stale, or hospitals having sensors that detect illness through subtle chemical signals — this is where the innovation is headed.

The upcoming update will introduce Reversed Screen Share, which lets you see and control your Android phone directly from your PC over Wi-Fi.  
Perfect for managing notifications, replying to messages, or just navigating your phone without picking it up.

Here’s a short video preview of how it works (coming soon in the next release).

I’d love to hear what you think, what use cases do you see for this, and what kind of controls or gestures would make it most useful for you?

And my favorite answer is: 

>

I’m a Board-Certified Hypnotist and Speaker — I’ve hypnotized thousands of people, from corporate crowds in heels and suits to retirees in Hawaiian shirts — and they all discover the same surprising truth:

You’ve already been hypnotized your *whole life.*

#  Let’s start with your morning coffee.

Ever driven somewhere, parked your car, and realized you don’t remember half the trip?  
That’s hypnosis.

It’s called **focused attention with peripheral awareness faded out.**  
You were in your own world — alert enough to drive safely, but your conscious mind was somewhere else entirely.

That’s trance. And it’s not “weird.” It’s your brain’s way of multitasking efficiently.

#  The Daily Trance Parade

Hypnosis happens naturally when you:

* Scroll social media and forget what time it is
* Get lost in a movie
* Daydream in a meeting
* Cry at a song even though you *know* it’s fiction
* Rehearse an argument in your head (and win every time )

Every one of those moments is a hypnotic state — your conscious guard relaxes, and your subconscious steps forward.

The difference between *those* trances and *intentional* hypnosis is direction.

#  Hypnosis = Focus + Intention

When you come to a hypnotist (like me!), we simply guide your focus *on purpose.*

Instead of drifting into a trance that reinforces old habits — worry, self-doubt, late-night snacking — we create one that supports the new story: confidence, calm, success, sleep, or even just “turning the page” at night.

You’re never *out of control.*  
You’re not “asleep.”  
You’re *laser-focused* on one idea long enough for your brain to say, “Oh, okay — let’s make this real.”

#  What It Feels Like

Everyone’s a little different, but here’s the common thread:  
It feels like **the best nap you never took.**

You might feel heavy and relaxed.  
Or light and floaty.  
Some people feel nothing at all — until they realize their hand is stuck to the arm of the chair (that’s always fun).

Mostly, you feel peaceful, curious, and a bit amazed that your mind just cooperated so easily.

#  Why It Matters

If you can go into trance without realizing it — and you already do — then you can start using that same ability to change your thoughts, habits, and emotions *on purpose.*

That’s the beauty of it:  
You’re not learning hypnosis.  
You’re remembering that you’ve always been the hypnotist.

So the next time you “zone out,” smile.  
You’re not distracted — you’re *deeply focused.*  
And your mind is listening… so make sure you’re saying something kind.

1oqunw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonSleep/comments/1oqunw6/analysis_recipe_efficiency_data_updated_for_the/,Analysis! Recipe efficiency data updated for the new recipes and ingredient mons,"When deciding what recipes to try and focus on making, I think it is important to not only think about the total strength but also the efficiency of the dish (the strength of the dish relative to the amount of time it takes to farm all the total ingredients) I made a spreadsheet a while ago to try to represent that, and I have recently updated it for the new recipes, and here are the results.  
  
The top 3 most efficient Salads are 

\#1 - “Bulldoze” Guacamole and Chips (2519)  
\#2 - “Apple Acid” Yogurt-Dressed Salad (2112)  
\#3 - “Defiant” Coffee-Dressed Salad (1966)

The top 3 most efficient Drinks/Desserts are  
\#1 - “Scary Face” Pancakes (2197)  
\#2 - Clodsire Éclair (2026)  
\#3 - “Zing Zap” Spiced Cola (2010)

And the top 3 most efficient Curries/Stews are  
\#1 - “Inferno” Corn Keema Curry (2155)  
\#2 - “Overgrow” Avocado Gratin (2094)  
\#3 - “Hidden Power” Perk-Up Stew (1974)  
So we can see that while you are generally best off making the highest strength dishes, there are some upsets in the efficiency ratings due to the ingredients involved in each dish. For example, Coffee Salad has a higher overall strength than Apple Acid, but Apple Acid has a better efficiency rating mainly because of how bad oil is. If you'd like to check the full spreadsheet, you can look at it here. [Spreadsheet link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H6P-866PQXeUNqWmJdgXBoYJsZsgHddI8EKM-uqZ5M8/edit?usp=sharing)

As for what has changed since the last time I posted, Keema curry was dethroned as the highest efficiency dish in the game and replaced by Scary Face Pancakes, only to almost immediately be replaced by Bulldoze guacamole. Keema curry remains the most efficient curry even though Overgrow Gratin has more overall strength,  mainly because it has herbs which are very efficient and Gratin has oil which is very inefficient. Right now the best oil farmer in the game is Luxray which isn't even a mono oil farmer, so we can expect all of the dishes with oil in them to become much more efficient once we get a mono oil farmer in the game. 

Also interesting to note that the efficiency rating of Zingzap Cola went up quite a bit when Farfetched was added, though not quite enough to surpass Clodsire Eclairs. They are about the same now. The new Scary face pancakes seem to be very good though.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

We chose this location because a ""hot tub"" was included as an amenity (little did we know it was a claw foot tub with a campfire beneath).

We drove up from Chicago and made our usual small-town grocery run before descending on our spot. The road to the yurt was primitive, winding, not easily located on a map and remote. As soon as we arrived we noticed a cabin where the owners usually stayed (they were out at the time) and a couple yurts. We were alone and the air was cold and dry. We breathed in and out, relishing the solitude away from the noise of the city. At this time a truck pulls up in the muddy roundabout, slows down, stops for a moment and quickly pulls away. Not the owners.

Since we arrived we'd been hearing shotguns firing in the background and shrugged it off as hunters in the area (this was the Northwoods, after all). We made ourselves at home in the yurt, cracked a couple beers and decided to explore.

We walked towards the cabin and followed a trail to the nearby frozen lake. We noticed something hanging from the trees and as we approached we found severed deer parts dangling in the air. Legs and torso with bloody cartilage, veins and all. We looked down and saw the deer head staring straight at us, tongue hanging from its mouth, sitting atop a wood shed looking in the direction of our yurt. My partner, a vegetarian and animal lover, looked away horrified. We looked at each other, heard more gun shots and made some sense of it (Northwoods).

We texted the owners, it took them a while to respond. They assured us it was their backwoods neighbors (""every country home has em, I suppose""). We felt reassured, but nevertheless a bit uncomfortable, unfamiliar and isolated. We were still the only folks on the whole property. We returned to the yurt, drank some whiskey, warmed up and went to bed exhausted. The yurt had no lock, but folks are friendly up here.. right?

The next day we woke up, felt refreshed and ready to have a birthday hike around the property. We made breakfast and ran out of the stocked firewood. Back to the old woodshed. As I walked I saw the deer head in the distance pointed in my direction awaiting my inevitable return. I grabbed the wood making an effort not to make eyes with the ill-fatal animal and quickly headed back. An interesting start to the day.

We milled about for a bit and I scrambled down a hillside to the edge of the frozen lake. I came upon a pile of old rusted tins including a pop-top beer can, a Folger's coffee tin from the 1950s and various little bottles of different colors. As a person who studied history these were all archeological findings to me and I spent the better part of the afternoon unearthing these things. I tossed them up to our site and we dusted them off and displayed them on our picnic table.

We moved on and down the road to some open public lands. I brought the whiskey with me and we took turns swigging the bottle. We literally stumbled upon an old car door, what looked like from an old pre-60s white truck, embedded in the ground. I asked my partner to take a photo of me with it and at that point my phone died for the remainder of the weekend.

All of these findings from that afternoon started to appear strange, like someone quickly packed up and left the property for good over 60 years prior. I realized perhaps I was meddling with some bad juju and moved on. That feeling lasted on the walk back to camp.

Our night proceeded as usual. The wind was picking up and the cold was blowing hard. We made a hot fire that lasted until we fell fast asleep.

I woke up freezing, the fire died and the potbelly stove needed to be filled and stoked back to life. But it wasn't the cold that woke me. It sounded like something was encircling us, moving in closer and closer. I woke up my partner and she asked ""is there another guest looking for their yurt?"". It had to be 3 or 4 in the morning, my phone dead so I didn't know.

Along came more noises, it sounded like a 3 gallon bucket just rolling and rolling, whirring louder and louder. This made some sense since we had used a bucket to fill the ""hot tub"" earlier. But it was incessant and grew louder along with the footsteps. It made no sense because the clearing in the woods couldn't have been more than 15 feet wide by 30 feet long and a bucket couldn't roll that freely. Unexplainable. We stuck a broomstick in the door handle to keep the door locked and kept our hatchet next to the bed.

My eyes were wide for what felt like forever. I must've managed to fall asleep at some point because I woke up to daylight and I never felt so relieved. I looked outside and there was the 3 gallon bucket sitting upright where we had left it, nothing touched or moved from the night before.

—

These were some of the creepiest woods I have encountered. There's something about that part of the country in the cold, dead of winter that makes you feel a little alone and empty, but like someone or something is always watching.

1oqumqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_cogLetter/comments/1oqumqo/full_version_cogletter2_motivation_is_overrated/,"[FULL VERSION] CogLetter#2: Motivation is overrated, why action comes first","We often think motivation is the spark that starts everything; but psychology tells us the opposite: action comes first, motivation follows.

  
**1. The Motivation Myth**

Every small action creates a positive feedback loop: 

*small step → small success → sense of progress → motivation.*

This is the essence of behavioral activation, a principle from cognitive-behavioral therapy. You don’t move because you feel good; you move *to* feel good.

Our brain seeks coherence, when we act as if we’re motivated, it eventually aligns our feelings with our actions.

**2. The Power of Simplicity**

Dr. BJ Fogg (Stanford) explains that behavior emerges when motivation, ability, and context converge. When motivation drops, which it always will, focus on ability. Simplify the action until it feels impossible to fail.

Examples:

* After my morning coffee, I open my notes.
* After brushing my teeth, I do 5 squats.
* After lunch, I walk 5 minutes.

The point isn’t performance, it’s momentum. Each micro-step says to your brain: *“I’m that kind of person.”*

  
**3. The Micro-start Protocol (summary)**

1. **Define a clear goal:** “Sleep 8 hours a night for a month.”
2. **Pick a cue:** a visible, specific trigger.
3. **Make it attractive:** pair it with something pleasant.
4. **Make it easy:** remove friction.
5. **Make it satisfying:** celebrate every micro-win.
6. **Handle friction:** treat setbacks as data, not failure.

  
**4. Self-kindness and Continuity**

Progress isn’t about perfection, it’s about *gentle persistence*. 

Bad days aren’t failures; they’re feedback. Adjust, don’t judge. And finally, trying counts. Every attempt reinforces the link between intention and action.



 Reflective question: what’s one small action you can take right now to build momentum toward what matters most to you?

Looking for a professional dental perspective because I’m getting mixed messages.

Like many people, I want to keep my teeth white. I’ve tried various whitening approaches over the years, and the one thing that consistently works, is affordable, and fits into daily life is whitening toothpaste.

I use Pearl Drops Whitening Toothpaste, and it genuinely keeps my teeth noticeably whiter. I don’t use it exclusively though — I split between that and Duraphat 2800 for cavity protection.

At my recent hygienist appointment, I was told I should stop all whitening toothpastes because they *wear away enamel*, increase sensitivity, and once enamel is gone, that’s it. I understand that risk. But the brand I’m using specifically advertises that it *strengthens enamel* and uses a “low abrasion formula suitable for sensitive teeth”. This seems contradictory.

Whenever I stop the whitening toothpaste and use only Duraphat for a couple of weeks, the staining becomes very visible (I drink coffee, tea, and red wine regularly), and my teeth turn noticeably yellow. It gets to the point where I feel like I need another hygienist visit.

I don’t intend to harm my enamel or create future issues, but I’m also unsure whether the only alternative is accepting permanently stained teeth.

So I’d love some clarity from dentists:

**1. Are all whitening toothpastes harmful to enamel or are some genuinely low-abrasion and safe for long-term use?**  
**2. Are the enamel-strengthening / “low abrasion” claims often just marketing?**  
**3. Should whitening toothpaste only be used occasionally and never daily?**  
**4. Is the** ***only*** **safe whitening approach professional whitening or custom trays with gels every few months?**  
**5. For people who drink coffee/tea/red wine, is there a sensible middle-ground strategy?**

1oqufz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthday/comments/1oqufz3/its_your_birthday_you_are_in_your_thirties_it/,"It's your birthday, you are in your thirties. It should be a day like all the others, except that it's THE day that reminds you how lonely you feel most of the time.","You look at your phone, expecting your parents at last, to send you well wishes. Tough luck. In hindsight, the day is shaping up to be terrible, but you are determined to just ignore it. You're just a day older than the previous one, after all.

So as you are getting up, you greet your husband. He is still sleeping, he's probably planning to work remotely today. You cuddle a little with your cat, she purrs, it comforts you. Then you get ready and leave for work. The traffic is fine. You start your shift, there is still no one, it's fine, working stops your mind from wandering.

Then at 11 pm, a text. It's from your parents-in-law. They wish you a happy birthday, they remembered you and it warms you up. You thank them briefly, you are still supposed to be working so you can't spend too much time on your phone. They ask if you are still celebrating Christmas with them this year. You are, you mentally remind yourself to get the train tickets.

And then a second text. From an acquaintance. He used to be a friend in Highschool, but you lost touch long ago. Just a text, it doesn't go further than that. He's that guy that always wishes birthdays to all his acquaintances and that sends another on New Year’s Eve. It still makes you smile. You try small talk during your lunch break, he replies. And for once, for once, it goes further than small talk. He chastises you a little for not reaching out earlier, and informs you that others have been wondering what you have been up to, this past decade. And that they are still using Facebook.

So for the first time in years, you log on your old account. You haven't been on social media, at all, ever since you attended College. Well, except linkedin. You learned the value of privacy and how all freely given data can be turned against you.

There are 3 texts, dated from more than a year. Well, better late than never. The first one is from your old superior, from the job that was so taxing you suffered from a burnout. You are still battling against depression, and anxiety attacks because of it. After a couple of exchanges, he states how you did ""good work"", how you set up ""new standards"". You start to break out in cold sweat. It was 5 years ago but just the reminder is enough. You don't like where it is heading, so you thank them and cut the discussion short.

Two others are from people you don't know, so you just ask them how you are acquainted.

Eventually, as you look into mutual friends, you find profiles from some of your Highschool classmates. Just a handful. You send greetings absentmindedly, it has been more than a decade, so you expect nothing out from it.

Then you get called out, your employer expects you in their office. Perhaps to check on your weekly progress.

Far from it. He shoves a slice of cake into your face, alight with a single candle. And places something wrapped into your hands. ""Happy birthday"" he voices aloud awkwardly.

You're a little speechless. You thank him. Get back to your desk. That was unexpected. You remind yourself to ask for his birthday later on, so that you return the gesture.

On the phone you left unattended for half an hour. The ones you greeted earlier on Facebook answered. You are a little bewildered. You forgot how to be friendly, how to exchange more than superficial replies just for politeness’s sake. Some sound genuinely excited to hear from you, and it feels uncomfortable. And before you know it, one of them informs you he still lives in the area. Mechanically, you invite him for a drink. To catch up. It feels like an outdoor experience, you are no longer that timid yet optimistic girl. It feels as if you've outgrown it. Like a too vibrant, worn-out piece of garment.

You suggest to meet at your place. You've never had guests, except for your in laws that visit twice a year. When you were a child, you never had people over since your appartement was too small to host a gathering. When you were a student, you were cramped out in a one-bedroom studio, so you went out occasionally. And now that you could afford a nice place to live, you had no one to invite over, which was kind of a waste, in hindsight.

You don't like to go out anymore, so inviting him to your place sounds like a nice compromise. Politely, you also invite the one that suggested you to reach out. And since he agrees and you'll be the three of you anyway, you also invite a couple more. And you find yourself with a guest list of at last 6 people, for the following week-end. You inform you husband by text. You can tell he's surprised but still asks what bottles (of wine) he should pick that would go nicely with our meal. That you haven't planned yet. Because you didn't expect to have guests when you got up this morning. Or to just have guests, that aren't your in-laws. For a change.

You refuse to ponder too long on what just happened. You focus on your work, like usual. It feels surreal. You'll just process it later on. Soon enough the day reaches to an end. You get home. Your husband greets you with a warm cup of coffee.

And you notice a cake that is sitting on the dining table. From the box, you can tell it's from your favourite bakery.

It's 2 hours away from your place, which means that your husband ordered it in advance and took 4 hours off work just to fetch it. Which is probably why he was ""working"" ""remotely"" today. You used to live close by, but ever since you moved out, getting this specific cake from this specific bakery was too much of a hassle. Except that he did. And you can tell from the size, that it's for 8 people. Your husband doesn't like cake, not at all, and you only told him about the guests late in the afternoon. That 8 people cake is actually, all for you, and he planned in advance & took the time to get you something he knew you would appreciate.

1oquf09,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1oquf09/new_grandparents/,New Grandparents,"GenXer here. This post is part vent, so please be kind.  I am feeling pretty vulnerable.
 My daughter (32 y) and SIL (33 y) recently became parents and both my husband (59 y) and I (58 y) are ecstatic to become grandparents.
What I never expected, was to have all these struggles.

My husband is struggling with the new guidelines for care of babies, especially  newborns.  He left my daughter in tears, when he kept ignoring her pleas NOT to kiss the baby.  He also likes to 'visit' and expects to be hosted rather than stop by to lend a hand, or at least bring them some coffee.

As a parent, I am grateful to experience one more stage of development, watching my daughter become a mom. My only struggle now is the memories of my time as a new mom, and how my husband was not supportive. His family would visit and we would have to host them. MIL would head straight for baby, wake her up, hold her for a bit, and hand her to me when she started crying, heading for the door.

I am shocked that my husband is acting like his own parents around our new grandson.  He has a great relationship with our daughter. They are best buddies for the most part.

I have always been open minded, and even if I disagree with the new parents, I respect their parenting style. They were comfortable enough and glad to have me over every day of my grandson's first week.

I am so proud and grateful for their supportive relationship. SIL cooks meals for my daughter, changes diapers, stays with baby while my daughter tries to get some rest because she pumps every 2 -3 hours. He is a hands on dad, which is amazing to see.

I keep thinking it's a generational thing with my husband, but that doesn't stop those ugly memories from popping up for me. Feeling alone and unsupported, and having that be the norm, I guess. My own family was not around, so other than a few friends occasionally stopping by, I did not have much support at all.

New medical guidelines require those around a newborn to get the Flu shot.
My husband did not get the Flu shot, and also, rides the ciry bus to and from work on a daily basis.  When he arrived at their home,  just as they ask everyone else, SIL asked to please  wash hands, leave shoes off (a practice we carry out in our home, too), and wear a mask.  Baby was 3 days old.

My husband rudely said ""stop micro managing me"",  walked to nursery and attempted to walk in without a mask. We again asked, please wear a mask. He turned ariund and said "" I don't need to see the baby"", headed back to living room, sat down and asked ""what's  to eat?""

Unfortunately,  as soon as we got back home, our son (28 y) attempted to ask why he wouldn't respect their requests?  Especially knowing they are following  medical advice?  They got into an awful back and forth, and I  had to intervene. It was ugly.  

What is going on with my husband?
When things calmed down, I again reached out to my husband to understand why he's  being so difficult. He still maintains that he has done nothing wrong.

A stage in life that should bring so much happiness (it did, until he spoiled it), has turned into some drama that brings the focus to himself, rather than the happy family events.

We are keeping my daughter and SIL from finding out about the argument between husband and son.  They don't need the added stress.

I am exhausted. There is history of him turning happy events chaotic, to regain the center of attention. 

After a couple of days cooling off and staying out of each other's  way, we were able to talk about it, and he still keeps saying that he is not at fault.  I said we then have nothing to talk about, and that he should seek help, because this behavior  isn't  normal. 

Some years ago, we did go to marriage counseling. I did all the work. Find the counselor, make the appointment,  etc.  This time, I left it up to him. He followed through, and we had our first appointment a couple of days ago.  It feels like we have a lot of work to do.  

I am posting here in hopes that it may not be unusual for people of our generation to have similar struggles.

The whole time they're together that's the impression she has of him, he's a supremely wealthy senior executive of a giant global bank - earning a significant amount of money.

However, it transpires at their wedding that he is not infact a highly educated (although he's undoubtedly smart, excepting when he doesn't understand who the French are) business exec, but instead their fallguy who only gets paid a lot of money to be held personally responsible for their shady transactions. Obviously its part of a masterplan, but at the end of the day he is uneducated and prior to that job worked at a coffee shop (no disrespect, but clearly not comparable).

Another hint is when she and Ted are at Punchy's wedding and she and Ted make the married-if-still-single-when-40 deal, Robin asks Ted if he makes good money, and isn't pleased when he doesn't (potentially a reason she's never that interested in him as a long-term partner? We know she finds him attractive and they get along well).

She has also previously dated a millionnaire, and is clearly very upper class as her parents are supremely posh/wealthy.

I think all of this is why her marriage to Barney crashed and burned within two years of finding out he's not a business-whiz, and remains unemployed (she even cites that his 'blog' is not a real job in their argument, and he's just trailing around after her working away).

Infact, I also think the FACT that she keeps taking work assignments abroad (when for the previous 8 years, or for the whole time in her job as news anchor, she was never away on assignment), I think this was a concious choice on her part to get away from Barney cause she's disillusioned with him.

I also think she just settles for Ted when she realises she's not going to find anyone else she finds on her level/suitable.

None of this is to disrespect her character, she wants to date within her class - thats her choice - but I do think that's a part of her character.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1oqu8tm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewJunkies/comments/1oqu8tm/vedge_protein_powder_review_probably_the_best/,Vedge Protein Powder Review : Probably The Best Tasting Vegan Protein Powder Out There,"Welcome to our **Vedge Protein Powder review.** When it comes to maintaining a healthy, plant-based diet, finding a high-quality protein powder that ticks all the boxes can feel like an uphill battle.

You want something clean, something that doesn’t compromise on taste or texture, and most importantly, something that doesn’t make you second-guess what you’re putting into your body. **This search can be mentally exhausting**, especially when you’re bombarded with options that don’t quite cut it. So what if there was a product that not only meets but exceeds your expectations?

For me, that product is definitely [Vedge Nutrition Protein Powder](https://theworldhealth.org/vedge-protein-official.html). This USDA-certified organic, **vegan protein supplement** can consistently deliver your daily protein needs and in my opinion is easily the **best tasting vegan protein powder** out there - by some margin. Let’s dive into why I think this product is a top notch **plant-based protein powder**.

# Product Overview: What Makes Vedge Stand Out?

**Product:** Vedge Nutrition Vegan Protein Powder  
**Category:** Vegan Nutrition  
**Overall Rating:** 4.8/5

Vedge Nutrition Protein Powder is a meticulously crafted blend of organic pea, pumpkin seed, and sunflower seed proteins. **With 25 grams of protein per serving** and a complete amino acid profile, this product is designed for those who care about what they’re putting into their bodies. No GMOs, **no artificial flavors**, and absolutely no shortcuts - just pure, clean protein.

What truly sets Vedge apart is its commitment to transparency. The brand conducts third-party testing for **heavy metals, glyphosate, pathogens**, and more, ensuring that every scoop you take is as clean as it is nutritious. It’s a level of diligence that’s hard to find in the supplement market, and it’s one of the many reasons why this product has been **highly praised** by experts and users alike.

# Detailed Analysis

**Refined Texture**  
Let’s face it - plant-based protein powders have a reputation for being chalky, gritty, and, frankly, hard to swallow. **Vedge Nutrition defies these expectations**. The [powder mixes](https://theworldhealth.org/vedge-protein-official.html) smoothly in water or your milk alternative of choice, leaving behind none of that dreaded grit.

**Flavor Options for Vedge Nutrition Protein Powder**  
Vedge Nutrition Protein Powder comes in a variety of delicious flavors, each crafted to cater to different taste preferences. Whether you’re mixing it into a shake, baking, or just blending with water, there’s a flavor to suit your palate:

* **Chocolate**: A classic choice, rich and smooth, offering that indulgent cocoa flavor without the guilt. Perfect for chocolate lovers who want a nutritious boost.

\-

* **Vanilla**: Subtly sweet and versatile, this flavor is ideal for those who like to keep things simple or use their protein powder as a base for smoothies and baking.

\-

* **Choc Peanut Butter**: Nutty and savory, this flavor packs the creamy taste of organic peanut butter, making it a favorite for those who crave a little extra richness in their protein shakes.

\-

* **Frosted Cinnamon Roll**: A unique flavor that captures the warm, sweet, and slightly spicy notes of a freshly baked cinnamon roll. It’s like enjoying a dessert while getting your protein fix.

\-

* **Cold Brew Latte**: For the coffee aficionados, this flavor offers the robust and smooth taste of cold brew coffee with a hint of creamy sweetness. It’s an energizing option that combines the benefits of protein with your love for coffee.

**Nutritional Value**  
With 25 grams of protein per serving, Vedge provides a good amount of plant-based protein that’s perfect for muscle recovery, **weight management**, or just meeting your daily protein needs. The blend of pea, pumpkin seed, and sunflower seed proteins ensures a complete amino acid profile, so you’re not missing out on any essential nutrients.

**Transparency and Testing**  
One of Vedge’s biggest selling points is its **rigorous testing process**. The company proudly shares its [third-party testing results](https://theworldhealth.org/vedge-protein-official.html), which include screenings for heavy metals, glyphosate, and other potential contaminants. Moreover, the product contains **no artificial flavors**, aligning with Vedge’s commitment to clean ingredients. This kind of transparency is rare in the supplement industry, and it’s a testament to Vedge’s commitment to delivering a product you can trust.

**Price Point**  
Here’s where things get a little tricky. **Vedge Nutrition Protein Powder isn’t the cheapest option on the market**. With prices hovering around $1.58 per ounce, it’s more expensive than many competitors like **Orgain Protein** and **Vega Protein**. However, considering the quality and the rigorous testing involved, many would argue that the price is justified. After all, you get what you pay for.

**User Experience**  
After me raving about it, nearly all of my vegan friends have tried the vanilla Vedge Nutrition Protein Powder, and they all vouch for its impressive quality. The powder blends perfectly into a morning smoothie, providing a creamy texture that is deliciously satisfying.

A couple of my girl friends did notice a slight delay in dissolving when mixing with cold water, which, while not a dealbreaker, was a minor inconvenience. But overall, it’s one of the best-tasting and smoothest vegan protein powders any of us have ever used.

# Star Ratings 

*  **Taste and Texture**: Smooth, pleasant taste with no chalkiness or bitter aftertaste.
*  **Nutritional Content**: Offers a complete amino acid profile and 25g of protein per serving.
*  **Ingredient Quality**: USDA-certified organic, non-GMO, and free from artificial ingredients.
*  **Transparency and Testing**: Extensive third-party testing for contaminants provides peace of mind.
*  **Value for Money**: Slightly pricey but worth it for the quality.

# Personal Experience

**I love it!** As someone who has tried various vegan protein powders, **Vedge Nutrition is now my go-to** for its [superior texture and taste](https://theworldhealth.org/vedge-protein-official.html). I found it particularly great for making protein-packed snacks like muffins and pancakes - where it blended perfectly without leaving any grainy residue.

That said, I did encounter a minor issue with it clumping slightly in cold liquids, which required a bit more shaking than usual. Still, this was a small trade-off for a product that’s otherwise exceptional.

# Pros and Cons

**Pros:**

* Smooth, non-chalky texture
* Complete amino acid profile
* Extensive third-party testing for contaminants
* USDA-certified organic and non-GMO

**Cons:**

* Higher price point
* Slightly harder to mix in cold liquids

# Pricing Options

1oqu89v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MapuaMCL/comments/1oqu89v/mageengineering_ka_sa_mmcl_huwag_and_heres_why/,Mag-e-Engineering ka sa MMCL? Huwag and here's why,"Sa mga nagbabalak mag-enroll ng Engineering dito, eto na para sainyo. Naggagaling sa isang estudyanteng gusto nalang madedski sa sobrang lala.

**1. Yung hirap ng courses, sobrang next level.** Yung feeling na inaral mo nang isang buong linggo, feeling mo magtotop ka na sa exam... tapos paglabas ng score, ""35/100"" pa rin. Ang sakit sa puso, parang sinampal ng realidad. 

**2. 60% ng grade mo ay exam. Let that sink in.** Isang maling sagot, isang mental block, bagsak ka na. Wala nang hulog ng langit o bonus points. Pag bumagsak exam mo, wala nang bawian 'yan. Goodbye laude, hello retake.

**3. Yung campus, ang liit para sa dami natin.** San ka magaaral? San kayo magmemeet ng grupo mo? Sa hallway na siksikan? Sa canteen na maingay? Kulang na kulang sa spaces para makapagcollaborate nang maayos.

**4. (Lalo na sa mga babae) Mag-ingat.** Sorry to say, pero if babae ka sa engineering, may chance na maharass o mastalk ng mga lalaking students. At ang mas masakit, kapag nireport mo sa Student Affairs, madalas ang sagot, *""Wala kaming magagawa, walang enough proof.""* 

**5. Mamimiss mo mga kaibigan mo... kasi aalis na sila.** Hindi biro ang pressure dito. Expect na yung mga kasabay mong magsimula, untiunting magshishift o magdidrop. Mamroblema ka na sa acads, mamomroblema ka pa sa pangungulila.

**6. Hindi uubra ang ""dasal lang"" dito.** Oo, naniniwala pa rin tayo sa power of prayer. Pero dito, kailangan talaga ng *sipag at tiyaga* na sobra. Yung tipong pagod na katawan at kaluluwa mo, kailangan mong mag-all nighter para lang makasurvive sa isang quiz.

**7. Hindi ito Catholic school, at feeling ko yung ibang prof, dito nanggaling sa impyerno.** Parang ineexpect nila na mula sa isang buto ng example, mamumunga ng isang buong puno ng solutions yung utak mo. Hindi tinuro yung mga kumplikadong formula o yung mga twist na nilalagay nila sa exam. Survival of the fittest talaga. Kaya ang ending, kailangan mong magselfstudy ng iba't ibang references, manood ng mga video tutorials sa YouTube, at magpakalbo kakaisip kung paano sasagutan yung mga problema na feeling mo naman, dapat itinuro.

**10. Ang bagal mag-grade ng ibang prof.** Magfifinals ka na, wala pa ring grade yung Module 1 mo. Paano mo malalaman kung pumapasa ka ba o hindi? E di hulaan mo! Parang mystery box every semester. Nakakabaliw maghintay, lalo na't 60% ng grade ang exams.

**11. Yung mga group activities, sakit sa ulo.** Laging may isang member na ghoster nandiyan lang sa GC pag may announcement, pero pag dating sa actual na gawain, parang nawala sa mundo. Ikaw ang magisa sa reporting, ikaw ang magisa sa documentation. Parang additional subject ang paghahunt sa kanila.

**12 . Maubos buhok mo, iexpect nyo na 'to. Walang takas.** Stress + puyat + pressure = byebye, luscious locks. Normal na dito ang makakita ng mga batchmates na may kalbo na ngiti o kaya ay nagpaplantsa na ng buhok sa sobrang stress. Investment na ang shampoo na antihair fall.

**13. Ang parking, isang malang malaking sakripisyo.** 8:30 AM pa lang, ang haba na ng pila sa parking. Dalawang oras kang maghihintay, mauubos pera mo sa gas sa kakaantay. Kung magkocommute ka naman, isa pang problema 'yon. Sobrang traffic, at minsan, ayaw pang bumiyahe ng tricycle kaya mapapaworkout ka na lang sa paglalakad. Part na ng curriculum ang pagpapalakas ng loob *at* ng binti.

**TL;DR:** Engineering sa MMCL ay parang hunger games. Kailangan matibay ang loob, matalino ang diskarte, at wag papatalo sa sistema. Magbaon ng maraming patience at coffee.",1,1762521637.0,MapuaMCL,0,1.0,False

I’m PythonShinobi, and I recently started working on *The Café Academy*, a learning platform designed to guide aspiring café owners through the process of starting and running their own business.

The idea came from my love of coffee and the dream of owning a café one day. I thought, why not create something that teaches people how to start their own cafés while I learn along the way? I also noticed there aren’t many resources that break down café ownership in a practical, step-by-step way. The platform currently includes guides on branding and things to buy for your coffee shop.

I’d love to get feedback from this community on a few things:

* For people who have built startups or niche educational platforms, how do you structure content to make it genuinely useful for users?
* Are there approaches you’ve found effective for validating your audience or understanding what they need most?
* Any lessons from early-stage building that you wish you’d known before launching?

While this is a niche project, I think the challenges of building it — deciding what content to include, how to organize it, and how to make it actionable — are similar to many early-stage startups. I’d really appreciate insights, lessons, or resources from anyone who has gone through the process of starting their own company.

Denise started about four years ago and we clicked immediately. Same sense of humor, same taste in podcasts, same complaints about the new cataloging system. We'd take our breaks together, text outside of work, got lunch on Saturdays sometimes.

She got engaged last year to this guy Trevor. I was happy for her. Met him a few times, he seemed fine.

Since the engagement things have been different. Not like dramatically, just... smaller. She stopped suggesting lunch. Started taking breaks at different times. Still friendly at work but surface level.

I thought maybe she was just busy with wedding planning so I didn't push it. Then she got married in August and I wasn't invited. Not even to the reception. It was small, I get it, but we'd been close for three years at that point.

After the wedding I tried to like, reconnect I guess? Asked if she wanted to grab coffee and catch up. She said she was really busy but maybe soon.

That was two months ago.

Now we work the same shifts and it's just polite. ""How was your weekend"" level conversation. She takes her breaks with this newer girl Amy. They go to lunch together.

I don't think I did anything wrong? I've gone over it so many times in my head. Maybe I said something that upset her and don't remember. Maybe Trevor doesn't like her having work friends. Maybe she just decided she didn't want to be friends anymore.

The worst part is we still see each other five days a week and have to be normal. I miss her and I don't even know if she notices.

My roommate says just ask her directly what happened but what if the answer is just that she doesn't want to be friends anymore? Then I have to keep working with her knowing that.",3,1762521297.0,coworkerstories,8,0.67,False

It's so easy to get obsessed with workouts, but I've been focusing more on ""inside"" fitness. Honestly, feeling good in my mind and less ""blah"" in my body has been the biggest win.

1. Warm Lemon Water: Before any coffee! Feels like a mini-detox and just wakes my body up gently.
2. Ginger/Peppermint Tea at Night: If I'm feeling bloated or snacky, this is like a warm hug for my gut. Helps me sleep better, too.
3. A 2-Min ""Mind Reset"": When I feel overwhelmed, I just set a 2-minute timer, close my eyes, and just breathe. It's like hitting the mute button on all the stress.

1oqu0io,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1oqu0io/jesters_trek_crossroads/,Jester's Trek: Crossroads,"For those of you who miss my old blog, good morning. This post is for you. For the rest, feel free to read if you want and warm up those keyboards and tell me about how wrong I am. Glance at your work e-mail, make sure there's nothing pressing, grab your coffee, and get ready for a long one. Your very old uncle Jester has a story to tell you. Are you seated comfortably? Very well. I'll begin.

EVE is at a crossroads this morning. And in an interesting sort of way, the last three years have been a bit of a coda announcing it… because we've been here before. Three years ago, during a Goon war, that loser was also hazed into asset safety oblivion, and there was much [rejoicing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-UD51isyxE) and [propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/nnpdmx/the_surrender_of_papi/) by the Imperium to celebrate the historic victory. And honestly, it turned out that it didn't mean all that much at the time; some of you - hell, most of you - probably don't even remember that the Goon enemy that was crushed in that war also involved PanFam.

PAPI at the time was a coalition of EVE alliances that included Pandemic Legion, TEST, Fraternity, and the remains of the NCDOT. And in due course they lost the war and surrendered. It's one of those stories and one of those wars that is surprisingly visible in the number of players EVE Online had (most aren't). Here's the story:

https://preview.redd.it/okiogvh04uzf1.png?width=924&format=png&auto=webp&s=2290183488963574d5b710f83279bedde0ae7090

Record scratch noises: yeah, that's EVE's logged-in player count dropping by about 25%, and yeah, presumably at least a portion of that is EVE's summer slump in action. But then the 20 days goes by, and you can see some players logging back in to get their stuff out of asset safety. But summer ended… and the game didn't recover. As a matter of fact, it took about **two years**, the end of scarcity, a surprisingly good 2023 expansion, and a whole [documentary video about EVE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCSeISYcoyI) for the player count to recover to status quo ante bellum. And that number is about where we are this morning.

It's tempting to say that that two-year desert of expired subscriptions is the real legacy of the Imperium's war against PAPI, but no, you know, that's not even true. There's another legacy, and it's the legacy of the funeral pyre. Even the remains of NCDOT are gone now, [TEST](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Test_Alliance_Please_Ignore) is a tiny shadow of its former self, [Pandemic Legion](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Pandemic_Legion) recently lost its last tiny vestiges of null-sec ownership.

But Fraternity - or as I personally think of them, ""Ghost Grass"", a deep-cut bit of lore for the Song of Ice and Fire nerds out there like me - is doing fine. They survived the war, they've more than [doubled their membership](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/alliance/Fraternity./stats/2021-06-05:2021-11-07) since the summer of 2021, are fine upstanding members of all six faction warfare militias (in what I'm sure was an absolutely intended use case for FW direct enlistment), and are currently deeply involved in a campaign that may as well be named ""2025 Punching Down Tour"".

But what can you tell me about Fraternity?

Let's go off on a short tangent. I swear to you that the following is relevant. Scott Bakula seems like a lovely fellow. Yes, Scott Bakula. Trust me, this is relevant. Ahem. Anyway, I've never heard anyone say anything bad about him. He's a serviceable actor. He's been married for almost 50 years now, and his Star Trek contract even had a clause that required him to be home on time once a week for family dinner. He's just nice. He's one of those faces that you recognize when he's in movies or TV shows but I'll bet you forgot that he was in Star Trek until I just reminded you, and he's not exactly what you would call memorable. Frankly, he's almost boring. And it gets worse because when he **is** acting, he can never seem to call up the negative emotions that a role requires. The best he can seemingly manage is disappointment or a faint aggravation that you have made him late for family dinner this week. Xindi atrocities or terrorist attacks can, at best, cause him to furrow his brow a little.

The part of Asher Elias in this morning's EVE movie will be played by Scott Bakula.

For when Pandemic Horde's vile detestable leadership declared that honestly, they found the idea of another pointless EVE war about as interesting as the rest of the non-null-sec players, Asher couldn't do much more than furrow his brow in consternation that the content for his coalition that he had apparently abandoned a region for wasn't going to happen. He made a [very Bakula-esque speech](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1opgcwp/unfortunately_sometimes_you_get_the_leaders_you/) decrying how terrible this was. And looking at this from an outsider's perspective - I myself last lived in sov null-sec 15 years ago - it was decidedly odd watching a Goon leader try to be the voice of reason in the room. ""Won't thou come down, Saruman?"" he seemed to ask, in another bit of fantasy reference.

But no, Horde would not come down from Orthanc so the Horn of Goondor was sounded and Orthanc lies besieged (picture credit to Sharp Reeves). And in due course, we're going to have another hazing to asset safety. The sharks will circle around an [obscure Kaalakiota station](https://evemaps.dotlan.net/station/Odebeinn_V_-_Moon_5_-_Kaalakiota_Corporation_Factory) on the edge of the Metropolis region. There will be a couple of days of content, and a few incautious EVE players will lose a few expensive ships.

And I absolutely assure you that we're going to have another cataclysmic drop in active EVE players for a while. And all CCP can do is [stand around](https://x.com/EveOnline/status/1986503189118488944) [celebrating](https://www.instagram.com/p/DQuYvSrjdw9/) the loss of another old voice in an EVE choir that hasn't had any new voices in a long, long, **long** time. But don't worry, CCP, nobody gives a shit because there are literally more people in R-AG right now than saw either of your social media posts.

""I don't have the Mittani bone in my body,"" Scott Bakula, er-Asher says, and yeah okay. Fine. I guess. But isn't that the problem? Nobody gives a shit. Say what you like about those old voices in the choir, but at least they had **style**. Quite fitting in a game about spreadsheets, modern EVE has become about as interesting story-wise as a management conference. And I'm not talking about wars. I'm talking about stories. EVE doesn't seem to have those any more. In the very unlikely event that Andrew Groen produces a third volume of [Empries of EVE](https://www.empiresofeve.com/), it's going to be about as interesting as watching paint dry.

The old sagas would pause their narrative from time to time to sing forth the names of the slain. Let this record copy their example. Let us sing of Mercenary Coalition, Triumvirate, Northern Coalition, Band of Brothers, Solar Fleet, Legion of Death (and its xXx variants), Shadow of xXDEATHXx, Mordus Angels, Chaos Theory, Gentlemen's Club, Atlas Alliance, Black Legion, DARKNESS, Nulli Secunda, Pangu Coalition, Escalating Entropy, Nexus Fleet, Red Alliance, Against ALL Authorities, Mostly Harmless, Fatal Ascension, NullSechnaya Shoulupen, Ethereal Dawn, RAZOR Alliance, Legio Astartes Arcanum, and even the short-lived KenZoku and IT Alliance, and on, and on, and on. There are dozens of names that I have forgotten, and I'm sure some of you will kindly remind me of them. And perhaps, we will soon be singing of Pandemic Horde...

...with a greatly reduced choir.

""Coalitions are how EVE works. They always have been,"" the sweet summer children [cry](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1oqqn04/coalitions_are_the_backbone_of_eve_and_why_solo/). But those of us with gray in our hair know that this is absolutely not even remotely true. When I was a sweet summer child myself, living in an obscure outpost in Scalding Pass, almost every evening, another gray-hair named Mukk Barovian would undock his Tempest and dare us to follow him down the the Curse-Catch highway (""Align Volmi, align Oh Shit, align Goat."") into Providence. And over 30 or so jumps, we would pass through the spaces of eight or nine small sov-holding alliances until most of us were destroyed. And then we would go out again. And then we would go out again. Two or three times a night this happened. And it was glorious. It was glorious.

We picked up our lab girl exactly 2 weeks ago, she turned 10 weeks yesterday. I wanted to check if there are any specific things we should be teaching her at this age, or anything we might be missing.

So far, she can:
	
•	Sit, down, and paw, all without hand gestures (though “down” isn’t her favourite 😅).

•	“Leave it” is about 95% solid now.

•	We’re working on replacing biting with licking, we say “kisses” and then “yes!” when she does it, and she’s starting to offer kisses on cue (and not bite, most of the time!).

•	“Stop” is a work in progress, especially when she’s mouthing or going after things she shouldn’t. She’ll pause, then try again 10 seconds later lol.

•	She knows “in” when we’re in the garden, though she doesn’t always listen right away.

•	Name recognition and recall (“come”) are going really well indoors.

We’ve started practicing everything in the garden now, but she gets a bit more distracted by all the smells and noises.

I’ve just started introducing “stay”, she’ll hold it for a few seconds, but if I move further away she follows me.

She’s okay in her crate, whines for a couple minutes then falls asleep. We’ve also left her in the kitchen alone for about an hour (while we popped to the shops) and she cried for 5 minutes then settled and napped on her bed.

We’ve been taking her out for socialisation too, coffee shops, parks, etc (carried of course, until she’s fully vaccinated).

Is there anything specific we should be teaching her at this stage? I just don’t want to miss anything important or put her at a disadvantage later on!",1,1762521015.0,puppy101,3,1.0,False

What if Tatum is the killer (poster in her room says villain and at the bottom says time heals,time kills which seems like two different perspectives side by side, Sidney’s perspective “time heals” and the villains perspective “time kills” Sidney at the end of the trailer has some pretty high emotion moments “where’s my daughter?!?” When she aims the gun and screams “Mother…” both of these moments she’s wearing the red zip hoodie with her jacket, which she has just the red hoodie on when sitting on the bed talking to Tatum when Tatum says “I wanna be a fighter like you” this is clearly taken place after the initial attack which is shown at the beginning of the trailer, I think Tatum is kidnapped during the coffee shot sequence, but for some reason her kidnapping feels like a red herring, to get her and Sidney separated and then to have Sidney come to ghostface alone. So here’s my full theory, Sid’s emotions at those two points feel pretty high, I get this vibe of deep betrayal deep devastation, Beltramis updated Sidney score is like the most haunting thing I’ve ever heard, I’m getting a not happy ending vibe for Sidney. I think Tatum is one of the killers, I think Anna Camp is Stu Machers biological sister and Sidney’s next door neighbor/best friend. I think Stu is in fact alive and his biological sister is involved somehow in that, and I think the two of them developed a plan to stalk Sidney, allow her to feel safe and over a period of her whole life, groom Tatum to be the one to devastate her, Sidney’s life was devastated from the murder of her mother at the hands of Billy and Stu, and the ultimate revenge for someone like Stu would be to turn her own daughter against her and literally ruin any hope of Sidney finding peace and happiness in this life.

1oqtycc,https://www.reddit.com/r/toRANTo/comments/1oqtycc/the_public_needs_basic_etiquette_customer_service/,The Public needs basic etiquette (Customer service related),"I work in Customer Service. My workplace has many departments the Takeout area the Dine in area the kitchen department and Catering to name a few. I am the Take out Manager. Which means that I am in the trenches all the time. 

I specifically told my boss I didn't want to get any promotions when I got hired as I used to be a Tim Hortons Manager and I just wanted a break from having to solve every little problem. Yet here I am 5 years later. I don't remember ever saying yes I'm the manager but everyone calls me that. 

It's a nicer restaurant and omg if I thought Tim Hortons was bad this is so much worse because we are in a high income bracket neighborhood and have to deal with the occasional person who thinks that they can intimidate me. Lol girl I dealt with crackheads you think you can scare me? It's a unique set of problems though 

- Why can't I bring my special little dog into the restaurant? He is a service dog I have to carry.
- Why can't my child run around screaming?
- employee doesn't speak English?  (Yes they do. Very well in fact. they just had an accent) Why are you hiring people who can't speak English?
- The people who try to talk down to employees do you know the difference between latte or a cappuccino?
- the ones who try to make an employee re-brew the literal same coffee 4 times. Like mam do you think the coffee will taste differently if they brew the same amount of beans in the same amount of water?
- the ones who try to come in like 5 minutes before we close and order large quantities. I know there is discourse on this. Some people think it's okay to do and it tells me they have never worked a closing shift.
- the ones who try to say they purchased x item before but they don't have a receipt or a time/date they purchased it or they forgot how much they paid. Like if you got an error or issue with your order yes it definitely happens. We are human and we will gladly fix it but do you think that I'm just going to take the word of some random person off the street open the till and give them money? Sir/mam we have records. I can go back years and check transactions. And I will know they are scamming because when I offer them an item in the store instead of a refund they get upset like bro I'm taking your word when I don't need to and offering you something to maintain Customer relationship and you want money? Nope lol you can raise your voice all you want I'll meet you with calm refusal and logic until you see how stupid you look.

- then there are the people who do not understand the difference between take out and dine in. Like I'm not upset about it or anything I just find it perplexing. How the whole point of earning a tip is because the server has performers a service or are in servitude like butler roleplay and the quality of the service is reflected in the tip. they are taking your order, refilling your drinks clearing your table. 

Take out is the opposite. The customer does everything themselves that is why they aren't required or expected to tip. They can if they think the employee did an exceptional job in line with the service offered by a server but they are expected to basically clean up after themselves yet the amount of people who think it's okay to just leave their stuff everywhere. And I mean in general. I see it literally everywhere I go.

I don't know to me it's an odd behaviour. Like you don't just drop your trash on the ground while walking when you are done because there are street cleaners right? 

We all grew up with our parents telling us to clean up after our selves. When you finish eating at the dinner table you bring your plate and cup/glass to the sink. You throw away any residual food left over. So I just don't get it why people go out to eat at a take out restaurant or a food court and just walk away from their trash. Seems like an odd disconnect / ritual. 

Anyway. I was just thinking about it. 

My team tends to get the worst of the worst customers to the point that most of them can deescalate any situation. And it's a little sad that they had to learn how to do that.

Like it's probably worse than I am mentioning here but I've just gotten so used to it that it just seems normal. 

Having to 'police' people during covid becauae of all the random changing rules while scared that we too would get sick.

Having to nod and take it at people berating or screaming at you.

Employees going into bathrooms to cry or the freezer to scream or the back to punch walls because sometimes it gets too much.

The Uber/Skip/Doordash guys not respecting boundaries/ skipping lines / being rude/ stealing food. 

Me having to play therapist to the team or body guard even though I'm only 5 foot 3 inches and sometimes I'm scared too even though I can fake it better than anyone else.

I just wish people recognized that the employees working aren't making policies and are just trying to survive. They are human beings not Service NPCs even though the corporate overlords try they best to make us all seem like it with the pre-approved scripts for everything.",10,1762520917.0,toRANTo,2,0.92,False

1oqtuqg,https://www.reddit.com/r/PickcelApp/comments/1oqtuqg/how_large_retail_chains_manage_thousands_of/,How Large Retail Chains Manage Thousands of Digital Screens Across Locations,"It’s easy to assume that retail digital signage is just about mounting a few TVs and running ads — but at scale, it’s an entirely different operation. Managing a network of hundreds (sometimes thousands) of digital screens across stores, cities, and countries is a complex balance of **content, connectivity, and control**.

Here’s how large retail brands usually make it work:

 **1. Centralized Cloud CMS for Content Control**

Every screen is connected to a **cloud-based content management system (CMS)**. This lets the head office manage, schedule, and publish content to any screen — or group of screens — remotely.

Marketing teams can push national campaigns instantly, while local teams still have access to customize content for their region (like language or offers). It’s a smart mix of *centralized oversight and local flexibility.*

**2. Hardware-Software Harmony**

At enterprise scale, reliability is non-negotiable. Retailers typically use **dedicated** [digital signage media players](https://www.pickcel.com/digital-signage-player) or smart commercial displays (LG webOS, Samsung Tizen, Android-based). These devices automatically sync with the CMS, play content offline when needed, and report their health status back to the dashboard.

So if a screen in New York goes offline, the system knows before the store manager does.

**3. Smart Scheduling & Dynamic Triggers**

Content isn’t static anymore. Screens change automatically based on **time of day, product availability, weather, or customer behavior**.  
For example, grocery chains might show coffee ads in the morning and snack promotions by evening. This level of automation helps each screen stay *contextually relevant* — even at scale.

**4. Real-Time Monitoring & Analytics**

Large networks run 24/7, so brands rely on dashboards that show screen health, content status, and playback reports in real time. It’s like having a mission control for your entire signage fleet — ensuring consistency and uptime across hundreds of stores.

**5. Consistency Meets Localization**

One of the biggest challenges in retail is maintaining **brand consistency** while allowing **local adaptation**.

  
A strong CMS lets brands lock templates and global assets while giving local managers the flexibility to add regional offers or festival campaigns — without breaking brand guidelines.",1,1762520656.0,PickcelApp,0,1.0,False

   1. Keep going with brown until the edges and just keep the pop of green in the underarm area, I can go back to the green and finish it off.

During this time, I’ve been actively listening to feedback, fixing issues, and refining the experience based on suggestions.

**Huge thanks to everyone who shared feedback, reported bugs, or keeps doing so — you’re absolute legends and have pretty much molded the app into what it is today.**

With the latest update, the **beta period officially comes to an end**. 
But the journey’s only getting started. The roadmap’s packed, and plenty more is already in the works.

Here are some of the key improvements made since the start:
- **Shortcuts & Siri integration (iOS):** You can now say “Hey Siri, capture voice in Quick Draft” to open the recorder instantly.
- **Flexible note paths:** Define custom note destinations using flexible date patterns like `/YYYY/[W]-w/YYYY-MM-DD`.
- **Custom note titles:** Name notes directly from the input screen.
- **AI-generated titles:** Automatically generate note titles with customizable prompts.
- **Configurable note insertion:** Choose where new drafts go — before, after, or inside specific sections of a note. You can now use **dynamic section names** — for instance, section `{{EEEE}} Highlights` will turn into `Friday Highlights`
- **Enhanced templates:** Wrap captured text in structure, use date tokens like `{{HH:mm}}`, and decide where attachments appear with the `{{attach}}` token.
- **Improved attachment handling:** Choose whether to insert an attachment preview in the note or simply save the file to a folder. This applies to sharing as well. You can also define flexible subfolder paths (e.g., `[Attachments]/YYYY/`).
- **Enhanced voice recorder:** Now supports recording pause and resume, reattaching existing audio files, and customizing file names.
- **Automatic link formatting:** Shared URLs are neatly formatted as `[title](url)`.
- **New toolbar actions:** Quickly insert the current date or time.
- **Added Light theme**
- **Draft persistence:** Text drafts remain saved even after closing the app.
- **Introduced a [wiki page](https://quickdraftcapture.app/obsidian/wiki)** that covers common setup examples and use cases.

If you’ve got ideas or feel something’s missing — my DMs are wide open! 
Always happy to chat and hear what could make the app even better.

I wanted a good business tycoon game but I couldn't find one. The closest I got to was Coffee Inc 2 which I've redownloaded several times after completing it. But since nothing else exists, I spent several months making one myself.

This is NOT a clicker game, there's No waiting for timers or energy systems.

You rent commercial buildings, choose which business to open, hire staff, manage inventory, upgrade locations, and keep customers happy so they actually buy your stuff.

The biggest challenge are 14 AI rivals who actively compete against you.

Customers love good deals, but price too low and you can't pay your bills. Price too high and rivals steal your customers. So find a good balance and outcompete them.

Mess with Titan Rivals and they'll start brutal price wars. You better have enough cash to survive the losses.



Late game features:

\* Rent HQ Offices to hire managers who handle customer/staff problems

\* Build warehouses to manage inventory across multiple locations

\* Hire delivery drivers to move stock between your businesses

\* Automate purchasing

I’d been working for weeks on this project, countless late nights, triple-checking every slide, rehearsing every line in front of my mirror. I even practiced breathing techniques I found on YouTube.

The morning of the presentation, everything that could go wrong did. My laptop froze, the projector wouldn’t connect, and someone spilled coffee dangerously close to my notes.
Still, I smiled through it, fake confidence, but confidence nonetheless.

When my turn came, I walked up, took a deep breath, and looked at the audience. My manager, the department head, and the clients, all staring at me, waiting.
I clicked the first slide… and my mind went completely blank.

Not “forgot a few lines” blank.
Like, “who am I, why am I here, what is marketing?” blank.

For a few seconds, I just stood there, heart pounding, every eye in the room on me. I could feel that familiar panic rising, the kind that makes your voice shaky and your palms sweat.

Then something strange happened.
Instead of reading off my slides like I’d planned, I just talked.

I started telling the story behind the numbers, how we came up with the idea, the late-night brainstorming, the small wins, the struggles.
I laughed a bit, made eye contact, and slowly, people started nodding. Smiling even.

Halfway through, I realized I didn’t need the script at all. I knew my work, better than anyone else in that room.

When I finished, the room was quiet for a second. Then the client clapped. My manager gave me a thumbs up. I actually saw people taking notes.

After the meeting, my manager pulled me aside and said,
""That was the most natural I’ve ever seen you. Don’t hide behind slides, you’re good at this.""

That day changed everything. I stopped chasing perfection and started focusing on connection.
I even took a presentation skills course later to polish what I’d discovered that day, how to structure a story, use pauses, read the room, and speak with clarity.

Now, presentations don’t scare me.
They excite me.

It’s funny, I used to think presentations were about perfect slides and memorized lines.
Turns out, it’s about having something worth saying and saying it like you mean it.

Whether it’s chipped edges, uneven shapes, stubborn stains, or small gaps - dental veneers can help you achieve that dream smile almost instantly.

These thin, custom-made shells are designed to cover the front surface of teeth, improving their color, shape, and overall appearance.

# What Are Dental Veneers?

Dental veneers (also known as laminates) are ultra-thin shells made from *porcelain* or *composite resin*. They are placed on the front surface of teeth to correct:

* Tooth discoloration or staining
* Chipped or broken teeth
* Uneven or irregular shapes
* Small gaps between teeth
* Worn-down enamel

Veneers mimic the appearance of natural enamel - smooth, glossy, and perfectly aligned.

# Why Consider Dental Veneers?

Veneers are one of the most sought-after solutions for people who want a smile transformation without major dental work.

# 1. Natural-Looking Results

Each veneer is customized for your tooth color and facial features, so your smile looks naturally beautiful - not “fake.”

# 2. Minimally Invasive Procedure

Only a thin layer of enamel (about 0.3-0.7 mm) is removed. This keeps most of your natural tooth intact.

# 3. Long-Lasting Durability

Porcelain veneers resist stains and can last 10-15 years with good care. Composite veneers are less expensive but may need touch-ups sooner.

# 4. Confidence Boost

A brighter, balanced smile can instantly improve how you feel about yourself in both personal and professional settings.

# Who Can Get Veneers?

You might be a good candidate if you have:

* Healthy teeth and gums
* Minor aesthetic issues
* Realistic expectations about results

People with untreated gum disease, severe tooth decay, or major bite problems may need other treatments first before veneers.

# The Step-by-Step Veneer Process

Getting veneers is a simple, comfortable process that usually takes 2-3 visits:

# Step 1: Consultation & Smile Design

Your dentist examines your teeth, discusses your goals, and creates a plan for your ideal smile.

# Step 2: Tooth Preparation

A thin layer of enamel is gently removed. Temporary veneers may be placed while your permanent ones are crafted.

# Step 3: Bonding

Once ready, the veneers are bonded to your teeth using a special adhesive and curing light. Final adjustments ensure a natural fit and bite.

# Caring for Your Veneers

Maintaining your veneers is easy - it just takes a few mindful habits:

* Brush twice a day with a soft toothbrush and fluoride toothpaste.
* Floss daily to prevent gum issues.
* Avoid biting hard items like ice or pens.
* Cut down on coffee, tea, and wine (especially for composite veneers).
* Visit your dentist for check-ups every 6 months.

With good care, your veneers can stay beautiful and functional for many years.

# Are Veneers Right for You?

If you’re unhappy with discoloration, chipped teeth, or minor misalignments - veneers can give you a naturally perfect-looking smile.

They’re a balanced choice between cosmetic enhancement and conservation of natural tooth structure, making them one of the best smile makeover options available.

# Final Thoughts

Dental veneers are more than a cosmetic fix - they’re an investment in your confidence and self-image.

If you’re exploring ways to achieve a whiter, more symmetrical smile, talk to your dentist about veneers. A consultation can help you understand whether porcelain or composite veneers are best for your goals and lifestyle.

1oqtkzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/rs_x/comments/1oqtkzp/crazy_joes_folly/,Crazy Joe’s Folly,"	Crazy Joe carried a gun with him. He read up on Argentinian death squads, how they tied you together with strangers and put a bag over your head for months. So if he’s ever caught he can just kill himself. He’s got a half smoked newport in his left ear and a lanky autistic gait. He knows to look out for black Chevy Tahoes with tinted windows because of the movie Sicario. He knows to look for Kias because of an instagram reel. He read online that they can use any car. And so he’s being followed all the time by anybody. Crazy Joe takes public transportation because you can smoke crack on the El and not get arrested. He passes a joint to his girlfriend, she hits it and they start arguing about how they’re gonna get more. He’s been laced again? She’s blowing his cover. He never loved anyone more. Or at least he thinks so. This image of her was a collaborative piece born out of hundreds if not thousands of hours of communication. She was on his mind always. It deeply disturbed him, especially on this laced joint. He’s cogitating rapidly, deeper and deeper into a pit of jealousy in his stomach. The envy, the sense of inferiority, burns through his esophagus, through his heart and his intestines. That what’s what we were, an intestine and a heart and a brain steam with two sphincters on either end, like a billion years ago or something. When they kiss their gastrointestinal systems link and they become one ancient being with two assholes. 
	Some sort of strong energy in her, indecipherable to him: calm and beautiful on the surface, chaotic underneath; an emptiness originating in the womb, absorbing and transmuting his insecure masculine energy into god knows what, a layered scent, minimal makeup, eyes, freckles, lips, nose, ears, hands, feet, breasts, legs, ass, pussy…
	He cannot escape this oppressive love for even a moment, they talk so often: constantly, chronically. Their minds are bridged through the phone, the phone. It’s just words but they stoke embers that brand her into his heart irreparably. Her corporeal manifestation is fleeting. He will never get enough. He’s established casus belli: they don’t hang out enough. It’s simply too much.
	He looks at his phone. He peers into it. What does it have to say? Nonsense without beginning or end: rhyzomatic, paranoiac, dysphoric.	Lightning flows through branches of logic in an instant. A conclusion is made and the evidence floods his mind ex post facto: she’s an imposter!
	Starbucks bombards him with love songs ceaselessly on a four hour loop. The words flow through one ear and out the other and make no contact with his consciousness as he works, except for a line in the chorus of a few songs: “Too good to be true,” “I want to have your babies…” all morning lullabies for the nurses of Pennsylvania Hospital wrapping him up in a naive opiate womb that upon reflection was exactly the state they needed him in. The space between heaven and earth into which she has welcomed him has him in a snare. He’s struggling against it, but his defenses are already dissolved. To occupy space in this woman’s life is a great privilege. But its not her, rather an exact copy down to the stick and pokes. All the fawning, the slicing through his defenses, extracting information: building a psychological profile to use against him. The laced weed, yes! Of course. It’s been planned all along: to thrust his ideal beauty into his life in order to make him insane, thus neutralizing his opposition to Palantir and the FBI.
	It started like this: “Is that who I think it is?” “Joe! Oh my god!” He spotted her outside a book store and was going to drink Guinness in a Cheesesteak Factory but decided to turn around when confronted with a noisy crowd and nightmarish vibes maybe three days into an alcohol relapse to find her sitting on a bench with an independent smile. They exchanged numbers. It started right away.
	She’s branching through tangents westbound through Drexel and Penn. Suburban college students are frozen in terror. He’s trapped in a humiliation ritual in front of the children of the elite. He gets off at 43rd street and froggers through market st into the opposite side of the station. She’s stuck on the cross walk. Thanks to be god, for she blessed him with a eastbound train with no wait time. And it was god to be sure, a reward for proper chi cultivation. Crazy Joe once practiced qigong for eight hours in order to summon benzos after a laced newport. That was the moment for sure, because he has been jacking off a lot.
	Get off at 15th. Recalibrate. Look at the astrological chart in city hall. Journey east and north towards fish town for cocaine: the original mission. Nah, too public. New mission: get on a trolley and go home to the apartment. Perfect. Now might be a good time to lose the phone. It’s too late. He goes underground and waits from the t10, opens instagram. Signs someone you know is a skinjob: 1) They are the closest people to you… He opens twitter: “Imposter Drones are the most attractive and charming among us… signs to look out for…” tarot readings, conspiracies: high schizoposting. He gets a notification from Live Universal Awareness Map: “Black Cube claims responsibility for imposter suicide drone attack that killed high ranking Red Mob member.”
	Was it someone I know? the thought flashes across his mind, Were they a part of my cell?Am I next? Now he’s hopping on the trolley. There’s cameras every where. Act natural. Avoid eye contact; they can tell by your eyes what you’re thinking. They’re everywhere: Palantir and FBI psychics. That’s who did this. Its why he’s wearing all reflectives: sunglasses and clothing and an n95 and a baseball cap, mitigating his opps’ psionic intrusions, but he’s caught on much too late. He used google maps to get to the book store on that distant spring day. They used his online activity to predict he’d want to go to that specific store, or they implanted the desire in his head subliminally. 
	When they knew each other before, as children, she was into the Cure and Crystal Castles  and was the first girl he knew who wore a septum piercing and vintage clothes—old growth scents: tobacco, perfume, sweat, weed on a black and white houndstooth sport coat, black hair with bangs and pale skin, a straight A student who read literature for fun, a self proclaimed manic pixie dream girl who’s core self was obscured by psychic webbing so complex as to take decades to untangle; she’s made considerable progress. How much has he changed, countless robitussin and acid doses, thousands of cigarettes, hundreds of liters of vodka, kilos of grass, five manic episodes later? Adults shouldn’t feel this way. This is childish. He’s a child. She’s something else entirely, something beyond human in his eyes. Her image haunts his dreams.
	The transition would’ve had to’ve been seamless. They would’ve had to kill her and dispose of her body and replace her at work without detection, or—because they’re social circles do not intersect—the imposter simply showed up in his life because they knew they would never run into each other, or she was an agent the whole time—he was flagged as a subversive as a child and she infiltrated his school—, or they never knew each other and someone snuck in his parent’s house and put her in his year books and implanted her in his memories, or…
	If you float you burn. New mission: onto Kensington for fentanyl; if you don’t overdose you’re a skinjob. He sends her messages: “I’m freaking out bc I think we were laced”
	“I’m sorry I ran”
	“I’m getting booze to calm us down”	“Meet me at the apt?”
	Seconds later, bubbles, then: “Joe, I’m really not okay.”
	“It’s gonna be okay we just need to ride this out”
	“It’s happened to me before”
	“I don’t like being on the El without you. I’m afraid I’m gonna get lost or worse.”
	“I know it’s scary right now but this will pass okay. We’ll be together again soon. Give me forty minutes or so <3.”
	“<3”
	This city sucks labor time and capital out of human beings like oxygen into organs; the subway pumps workers into jobs, drunks into bars, addicts into drug markets, students into school. The crowd is sunctioned towards eastward doors as the train makes a screeching halt back at 15th street. At Girard it begins to shed its hipsters, replaced by addicts with swollen and/or missing limbs. The front door of the train swings open and a twenty something with unkempt brown hair and beard announces himself: “Excuse me! Excuse me! I’m really hungry and thirsty. Can somebody please help me out?” He walks by the seats, empty coffee cup in hand. Crickets. Onto the next train. His odor lingers. 
	It’s harder to tell who’s following you on the train because no one wears uniforms except for like maintenance workers or whatever. Crazy Joe’s head is on a swivel. He can feel someone staring at the back of his head. He flips around and scans the compartment for anyone quickly averting their gaze. No one. Frustrating. He needs to be seated optimally for counter-surveillance. Unfortunately, the seats on either end are taken by teenagers with two or more cell phones smoking blunts. Stale ash and body odor, essence of steel reserve, eyes into cell phones and the train’s too loud so nothing can be heard. Letting one’s self go. Just stop putting in effort. Just let it go, like that Disney song. Let yourself go: become a homeless heroin addict—chase one pleasure at the expense of all others. Become stinky. Shit and jack off in the street, have nothing to wipe with, and just live with an oily crust in the taint region. That would be easier. They wouldn’t have any reason to follow him then. 
	A stylish woman enters the car and stands next to him, her scent draws him, takes him back to an Autumn day ten years ago. It was warm and she told him to bring a jacket in case it got cold out. She wore that houndstooth coat. He remembers rolling a joint on a curb outside the elementary school they both attended. She told him she was into painting and showed him these hyper-realistic close up portraits that upon reflection months later were taken off of google images or Tumblr or something. She told him she spoke multiple languages, and could only say “Hablo un poquito de español.” She told him a lot of things. It was not difficult to pull the wool over his eyes, only took some beauty and a relatively sophisticated spectacle of sophistication. He was naive and she was a talented liar. All those love songs she sent him were meant to lull him back into that naivety. All those words, the flattery, meant to draw him closer into that emptiness inside her. They couldn’t have come up with a better person to fuck up his life if they tried. She was a genetic weapon. 
	A baby stares at him. Babies are easier to fake than adults. He assumes those eyes are cameras and those ears microphones. Of course, he can’t say anything or stare—it’s a baby—, but this genderless thing is staring at him. He averts his gaze to find a woman averting her gaze. In a panic, he looks away but wherever he looks people are staring at him. I’m compromised! It’s time to ditch that phone. He gets off at the next stop in a panic, fishes his phone out of his pocket, snaps the sim card and smashes it against the ground and stomps on it until the battery expands. He doesn’t know where he is, so totally in delirium he is. He looks around for signs but all he sees is empty signifiers: shoes, “Gas out!”, logos on shirts. Signs referring only to other signs online, which he’s temporarily abandoned, causing his subconscious to roll out from underneath him and loop back and slam into his prefrontal cortex and recycle through his entire body. He wanders down the stairs, aimlessly, bewildered, losing track of whatever tail or tails may or may not be following  him.
	He’s got off on Alleghany, perfect, the land of the walking dead according to so many sensational YouTubers. Addicts take the pilgrimage from all over the country, unsuccessfully mending broken hearts with opiates and benzos and crack and meth and all the rest, epigenetic trauma weighing on them like mountains and the drugs providing only a brief respite in the form of oblivion. It piles up, beneath consciousness, their trauma, and oblivion pushes it down where it rears its head in the form of indecipherable angst when they come out of their highs. Besides the physical withdrawals, this is what keeps them hooked. The drugs are getting worse. Shorter half lives, greater potency. Any old heroin user will tell you they used to be able to hold a job, hold onto their families, on account of heroin’s long half life.
	Cricket Wireless, pawn shops, every building a primary color, men and women folded in half on wheel chairs—it’s only dangerous if you’re an addict and as a white man it doesn’t take long for him to get offered fentanyl, only had to step over a few half dead corpses and avoid the beggars who assume he has any kind of resources whatever. He buys a few milligrams of dope and heads to the opposite station. This time there’s a wait.
	She goaded him into spilling his guts (or had he been simply braggadocios?). He told her everything. His every mundane trauma, and—distressingly—what he’d been up to in the subterranean scene: sourcing drones and explosives from China and the Middle East, thus positioning himself as instrumental in the Red Mob’s assassination program in the Middle West. Red Mob spread throughout the country, infiltrating every other City-State and wreaking havoc in fascism’s rear while the Union engages in trench warfare on the front lines. In his mind, it was romantic, but assassinations were hard even with drones in that you had to get the right person and not just someone who was the same height and had a similar gait; he had a lot of blood on his hands. At any moment he could become a target, or he already was. 
	She concealed what she had been up to and he has that kind of dim awareness that only shows up in dreams, even then only that there’s something hidden beneath the surface. There were hints, but everything blended together into a field a floating signifiers with no center. It’s a dazzling spectacle. What he now realized, what she probably knew he knew now that the terminal sequence of his destruction had been initiated, was the she was his enemy and that these were the last hours of life. In an underground facility, a Raytheon Pathfinder, a suicide imposter drone—known colloquially in the paranoiac imagination as the “skinjob”—was constructed in his image, with something that on the outside at least perfectly replicated his personality, and is now heading into the city proper in an unmarked military vehicle, he’s convinced. The destruction of the phone bought him some time, and he’s heading back westbound and the subway system is too public, too crowded to move against him. “Where are you?” She sends.

* Search by city or ZIP code  
* Filter by business type (dentists, restaurants, gyms, etc.)  
* Export or manage leads easily

When we divorced and I met my now husband, I honestly couldn’t believe my luck. I had to unlearn so many things. I remember once spilling coffee on his sofa and going into a complete panic, expecting him to shout or get angry. Instead, he just laughed and said, “It’ll wash.”

After two years together, we got married and soon after found out I was pregnant. When we had a missed miscarriage, he sat beside the bathtub for hours just being there, supporting me through every moment of pain.

Six months later, I fell pregnant again. It was a tough pregnancy, but he did everything he could to make me comfortable. He came to every appointment and cooked for me. When I gave birth, he was right there, holding my hand and encouraging me through it all.

In the newborn days, when everything felt like a blur, he was the best partner I could have ever asked for. He took turns doing the night feeds, told me to rest, and always reminded me that I wasn’t alone. He’s such an incredible dad. He rushes home from work every day just to see us.

* Packaging from mushrooms - replaces Styrofoam and decomposes naturally.
* Programs for reusable containers at coffee shops and supermarkets - cutting the use of plastics that are thrown away after one use.
* Bioplastics that are compostable and break down faster and non-toxic.
* Packaging that is circular, where every material is meant to have a second life.

Do you ever wonder what happened to the days when it felt like we had more time?

We used to have *built-in transitions* like commercial breaks between shows, quiet drives without constant notifications, and slow internet that made us wait (and breathe) for a moment.

We had pauses, natural breaks, and moments of togetherness that helped our bodies reset.

Now, everything is instant.  
Every gap in our day gets filled…checking messages while waiting in line, scrolling while the coffee brews, or rushing straight from one task to the next.  
Without realizing it, our nervous systems rarely get a chance to exhale.

What’s missing isn’t more hours, it’s *transitions.*  
Those small pauses between what was and what’s next are where we recalibrate, reconnect, and remember how to be present.

✨ Take a few deep breaths before diving into what’s next.  
✨ Step outside after work before shifting into home life.  
✨ Give yourself permission to do *nothing* for a moment.

When we honor transitions, our days begin to flow with more ease and intention, and life feels a little less like it’s rushing past us. 💛

[Read](https://www.lifebydesigntherapy.com/therapy-blog) our latest blog for more on why transitions matter and how these small pauses can help you move through your day with calm and clarity. \[Link in bio\]

I started with pour overs, tried a few different brewers and learnt a lot about it. Last year I’d been to a workshop to get into espresso and since then I’m absolutely down the rabbit hole.

I had the chance to try some machines at friends and the workshop but I need help to decide my first espresso machine. So we drink 2-5 milk drinks a day and I’m more one the lighter side of roasts.

I have a DF64 Gen2 which should be a good enough grinder for me and the budget is ~1500€

EDIT: 
what I was thinking of:
- solid build quality
- dual boiler for consistent steam power
- PID 
- Pre Infusion
- if possible a black housing 

So here are the once I think could be interesting:

Profitec Pro 300

•	⁠lack of PI, but do you really need it?

Profitec Move

•	⁠slightly above my budget, but ticks all the boxes

Lelit Mara X

•	⁠could be a cheap option, but I read a lot about  needing to adapting to the machines routine and I don’t like that

Bellezza Bellona

•	⁠ticks all the boxes, but I’m not sure about build quality as I want a solid build machine sich lasts for years

Posting here in case someone from Benilde or SDG sees this 🙏

I lost my iPhone 13 Pro during the Pre-OJT Civil Service Exam Orientation for SDG students held on Friday, November 7, 2025, at the Ideation Room (around 5:30–7:30 PM).

I only noticed it was missing after the orientation, and I’ve already tried checking the room and asking around, but no luck so far. I’m a student from SDG, and that phone has a lot of personal and school-related stuff, so I’m really hoping it turns up.

Details:

* Model: iPhone 13 Pro
* Last seen: Inside/around the Ideation Room during the SDG CSE Orientation
* I can verify it’s mine (lock screen wallpaper, exact contents, serial/IMEI, etc.) in DM

If you picked it up thinking you’d return it later, or know someone who suddenly “found” an iPhone 13 Pro after that event, please DM me here on Reddit. I’m just really hoping to get it back.

I’m also willing to give a small reward as a thank you.

Please help boost this or share with anyone from Benilde / SDG who might’ve been at the orientation. Thank you so much.

When I went there, and immediately everyone was surprised to see me, cause why would a random guy join a group of people he doesn't  know, I knew 2 of them, but not that closely...it felt real awkward, and I didn't talk to anyone, not even the guy that I though called me, I wanted to say something cause it's sorta rude and all not to, but nothing came in my head, I didn't look at anyone for the most part. I was mostly on my phone cause I really had nothing else to do, I looked at them, idk smiled at them when I thought it was right to do so, but it didn't really feel right, probably cause me being there wasn't right in the first place...I could've just left, made something up, but I didn't for some reason, I should've when I think about it now. I couldn't tell you why I didn't...

Well, I tried to relax and all, but there was always something bothering me, I couldn't really tell you why, but something bugs me all the time when I'm with people. I ordered something to eat with coke but even that felt weird cause noone else was really eating anything, and I felt really weird, like I was with them, but not really, I tried listening to them so something would pop up in my head, anything to say, but nothing felt right, I was feeling real guilty, like I was bothering them, being kinda annoying there...

Hey there! My name is Brad and I am 36 from EST. It’s Friday and I would love a good chat or voice call to start my day! Let’s get to know each other as we enjoy our coffee and get ready for our day. I’d love to develop something long term and have someone to share things with throughout the day! 

A little bit about me, I live alone with two cats and work from home as well. I enjoy video games, playing guitar, love listening to music, reading, watching documentaries, drinking coffee and taking naps! 

Feel free to send me a chat if you’re interested in getting to know each other! ",1,1762517647.0,IntrovertsChat,2,1.0,False
