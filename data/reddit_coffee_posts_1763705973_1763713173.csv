My Philips 5400 is no longer producing nice milk foam, and the rinsing process is also no longer carried out correctly, as you can see in the video.

I have already done the following:

After 2 months of continuous study, I’m thrilled to share that I passed the CISSP exam on my first try. The journey was intense, but focusing on understanding concepts rather than memorising really paid off.

**Background:**

* 5 years of experience in consulting and penetration testing
* Previously cleared OSCP, CRTO, and other technical certifications

**Study Resources I Used:**

* **OSG 10th Edition** cover to cover (8/10)
* **Destination Certification** mind map videos + mobile app quizzes (8/10)
* **Quantum Exams:** (10/10)
   * 1st–3rd attempts: scored 550–600 → reviewed all questions (why correct/wrong), revised using my own notes
   * 4th attempt: scored 930 (Obviously because of repeated qns)
* **Prabh Nair Coffee Shots** 
* **Andrew Ramdayal** videos (50 hard qns) 
* **ChatGPT and Claudi** to clarify doubts 

**Productivity Tip:**

* Do utilise small pockets of time - while driving (audio versions), at the gym, or during commutes. Podcasts and mind map videos work great for this.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Quality study beats quantity - deep understanding matters more than rote learning.
* Practice exams and reviewing why answers are right/wrong are **invaluable**.
* Consistency is key. Even a couple of hours daily adds up massively over 2 months.",1,1763712597.0,cissp,0,1.0,False

Some days swirl with endless demands, missed calls, traffic jams, and hurried mornings—the chaos we all know too well. Then come the quiet pauses, the laughter shared over coffee, or the comfort of someone who understands you without words—the calm that holds everything together. The Chaos/Calm couple t-shirt captures that beautiful imbalance. 

Designed for couples, friends, or anyone who lives between the rush and the rest, this design symbolises two sides of the same story. One shirt bears “Chaos,” boldly struck through, while the other says “Calm.” Together, they tell a tale of contrast and connection—that even in disorder, there’s companionship, and in silence, there’s strength.

Made from soft, breathable fabric, these tees pair effortlessly with daily wear, reflecting modern relationships built on balance and acceptance. Perfect for partners who thrive in their differences or individuals who embrace life’s unpredictable rhythm, Chaos/Calm celebrates imperfect harmony—love, work, and everything in between.

 Wear it as a reminder that peace isn’t the absence of chaos; it’s finding calm right in the middle of it.

Ideally I'd love for it to lead to something long term, but I'm also more than happy to just meet some cool people and be friends if that's the vibe!

I've been living Downtown Toronto for the last many years. I like to think I don't take myself too seriously, and very much in the nerdy/goofy/slightly chaotic kind of person, but in the cute sorta way 😅

I work in tech (which I love!) and outside work I'm mostly in a constant rotation of hobbies and learning about different things, but some of the stuff that's stuck around over the years have been photography, rubik's cubes and escape rooms. I also enjoy watching TV / movies, and I'm a sucker for comedy and sci-fi stuff. I don't read nearly as much as I would like in recent years, but I do enjoy the occasional audiobook and always looking for recommendations or sharing my favorite ones! I wanted to go into teaching, but sadly that didn't work out so nowadays I just settle for telling people the details about whatever I'm fascinated with at the moment.

I'm also generally a late night person - let's just say my sleep schedule has taken some creative liberties, so I'm always down for some late night hangs or spontaneous activities. Work is a little demanding sometimes so I do like to be a homebody more often than not, but I can be lured out with a fun activity or dinner/coffee plans.

Would very much prefer to meet in person / at least getting on a call to get to know each other as opposed to the endless-texting cycle that seems to be common lately. I find it much easier to see if we vibe together or not when we get to actually be around each other instead of online, and would appreciate trying to find something that works for us sooner rather than later.

For those that care: I'm 5'9 and originally from India. If that's a dealbreaker - well thanks for hearing me out anyway.

Who I'm looking for: Ideally someone who lives downtown or commutes there often, and is open to hanging out regularly and open to taking things by ear. I'm not particularly hung up on age / ethnicity etc as long as there's chemistry between us and we can enjoy each other's company. If you like dad jokes (send me one pls) and nerding out talking about things each other likes, you'll fit right in 😊

If any of this sounds like something you'd be interested in, drop me a message and let's figure out a cute hang that works for both of us~ Bonus points for your best/worst pun",1,1763712372.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I know that my sleep isn't the best in general but it has been like this for years. I am a 25 overweight male but in general I maintain a healthy lifestyle. I don't drink alcohol or coffee and the last 6 months I have been getting a lot of activity and trainings.

Sleep has been the same although. I have some issues with chronic anxiety but other than that I feel well especially the last 4 months. I have been doing much better with my anxiety over the past year. I am taking daily D3, B12, Magnesium Glycinate, and 1MG of melatonin. I have also started taking Ashwaganda first thing in the morning after a light meal.

The issue is that I wake up a lot during the night. I rarely wake up refreshed but I almost always get in rhythm after an hour or so and I feel well after that.

Although for me its really alarming how many times I wake up per night. You can see some instances below. Usually its exactly the same thing. To keep things clear I don't remember all of this wake ups. I usually remember 3-4 wake ups per night.",1,1763712325.0,sleep,3,1.0,False

Here is a brief summary of everything talked about. 

Disclaimer: I’m not gonna quote exactly what he said cause that’s to much work rather I’m just gonna give a short overview of both the questions and the answers:

First up are the TBATE questions.

Q1: will you ever return to the world of TBATE?

A: I decline to answer but like maybe.

Q2: elaborate on the deva?

A: they were enemies of the asura (aka stuff we already knew) but I decline to explain further.

Q3: how does ki work and can Arthur get as strong as he was before?

A: it’s fundamentally different from how ki in its source compared to back on earth but there are some similarities and it can do similar stuff. as for potential Arthur is definitely still strong and can get stronger but he’s not gonna be warping reality again.

Q4: how will Arthur teach the world aether?

A: the Relictombs mainly. He also still fundamentally understands how aether
 works so he can still teach.

Q5: can you give us the order of events for these 8 moments in the lore

A: 
1 asuran evolution of the asura’s 

2 the war against the wraiths

3 the deva showing up

4 the removal of epheotus 

5 the death of Aquinas 

6 The supposed death of geolus

7 mordain leaving epheotus 

8 agrona’s rebellion

Q6: can you name drop the unnamed asuran weapons. (Process to list every unnamed weapon)

A: cool question. I have some ideas but I’m not married to any of them so I decline to answer. I know y’all want an encyclopedia and I might make one but not now.

Q7: what did Agrona want.

A:  so original he was just gonna use the legacy to make himself OP and dip and go find the deva but with her gone he decided to just blow everything up to bring the deva to the world.

Q8: are you surprised the kickstarter did well.

A: yes. It did way better than expected. 

Q9: when did you come up with the name of the world?

A: It took a while and evolved over time. I originally thought it should be a combo of Arthur’s , Sylvie’s, and Regis’s names but that felt tacky. I wanted the name to not come from Arthur cause of his character. I then came up with Pax coranata cause it’s a good representation of the world’s current state.

Q10: what’s the meaning behind the giant goldfish?

A: there is none.

Q11: when did you come up with the names of the twins.

A: it was literally my first thought for names.

Q12: why do the portals not work right now?

A: Arthur reshaping the world caused blowback. If I do a sequel I’d like to explore the consequences of this. (he then goes on a random tangent not permanent to the question)

Q13: are you a fan of Brandon Sanderson?

A: yes. I like his books and I’ve watched his lectures. (W TM)

Q14: in a game of sovereigns quarrel would win: Agrona or kezess and could ether beat Arthur 

A: Arthur with king’s gambit > Agrona > Kezess. (He implies Arthur needs king’s gambit to beat both.)

Q15: are soul forged and TBATE connected.

A: thought about it. Maybe. I’m undecided. Not a priority.

Moving on to soulborn questions.

Q16: what was the process of making SF? What was your inspiration? (This encompasses a bunch of questions)

A: I saw solo leveling and I liked the concept of rifts. I started writing it 4 years ago. It went thru several iterations but the soul motif has remained since its inception.

Q17: how much is the story is planned?

A: I’ve finished book 1. Working on book 2. I’ve got a general idea on where the story will go.

Q18: can you explain ruins in SF?

A: can’t really answer cause spoilers.

Q19: do you have info for your 3 unnamed projects?(again this is kinda just a combination of different answers from different questions)

A: can’t really say much. They’re all different series and you won’t have to wait more than 2 years to see them come to light (my personal interpretation of this is he hasn’t finished the first volume for all of them so we have to wait till that’s done)

Q20: is grey being torrents last name a reference to Arthur.

A: yes.

Q21: Arthur and torrent fight differently. Why?

A: Arthur’s and torrent’s original ideas are inherently different. Arthur was important and powerful before the story started while torrent is starting from the bottom.

Now for the live questions:

Q22: what’s cons are we doing.

A: Sakura and emerald city. Anything else is TBD.

Q23: favorite fight.

A: Cadell vs Arthur.

Q24: will you release the novel in other languages?

A: definitely the next step. I want to make sure it’s good so it will take time.

Q24: how long did it take to get an editor.

A: Volume 4.

Q25: will you ever give us the rules for Sovereigns Quarrel.

A: the rules are still being refined. I may be making the whole game for a kickstarter. No promises on the kickstarter.

Q26: when is season 7 coming out?

A: I can’t say more than what’s been publicly announced. (Literally reiterates what’s already known about the release date aka before the anime)

Q27: thoughts on webtoon pacing?

A: I’ve altered the pacing at certain parts and overall I think it’s been good for the webtoon.

Q28: when will V12 audio book be released?

A: after the remastered version of the earlier volumes do. likely around mid 2026. (He’s a bit unclear whether he means V12 in general or the audiobook specifically will come out in mid 2026)

Q29: honest opinion on the anime?

A: it’s continuously improving. (He later clarified some questions about the studio saying he wasn’t given a selection.)

Q30: tea or coffee?

A: coffee.

Q31: gun to your head which would you rather do a prequel or a sequel for TBATE?

A: I choose to keep it a secret (straight up choose to take the bullet)

Q32: SF audio book? SF webtoon?

A: for the audio book, yes it’s already in the works. For the webtoon, nothing is planned but I want it.

Q33: favorite TBATE character?

A: the main trio.

Q34: how did you feel about Lucas’s death?

A: could have done it better. Could have done the lead up better. I felt pressured to finish the school arc quickly so I didn’t really get the chance to do everything I wanted.

Q35: what happened to dreneeve? (Dreneeve has fans?)

A: I have an idea with him and Kai. Don’t know if I’ll ever write it down. (No need. bums don’t need exploration)

Q36: what is the existent of the kinda unlimited changes?

A: nothing plot related. Just adjusting language and adding some more foreshadowing. 

Q37: will ren and Rey get their own story’s ?

Q38: I decline to answer.

Q39: did you imagine TBATE would become one of the best WN’s?

A: I don’t think it is one of the best WN’s. Still proud of it. I’m gonna keep strive to make one of the best WN’s.

Q40: WN tier list?

A: been a minute since I read one. Last one I read was corny dragon. (I think that’s what he said. He’s not really clear)",1,1763712184.0,tbatepatreon,0,1.0,False
1p2sx9i,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p2sx9i,Selling 5 Million Units in a Year: His Phone Holder Takes the World by Storm,"I. Dominating the Industry with Phone Holders

At some point, ""involution"" became a buzzword across various industries. On one hand, there is widespread resentment toward meaningless competition; on the other, the phenomenon of involution continues to evolve, seemingly dragging both buyers and sellers into a senseless race.

As energy is drained by this relentless competition with little to show in return, resisting or escaping ""involution"" has become a hot topic. While some are still figuring out how, others have already found a way forward.

Tian Wen from Hubei is a prime example. In the niche market of phone holders, Tian Wen and his team at Shenzhen Zhongxintongtai Technology Co., Ltd. have leveraged independent research and development and strict control over channel profits to rise to the top of the industry.

One of their hit magnetic phone holders, launched late last year, sells for a few dozen RMB domestically and over $20 overseas. Thanks to its powerful magnetic suction and compatibility with various smooth surfaces, this holder went viral online, with monthly sales reaching tens of thousands of units across major platforms.

Even now, the popularity hasn't faded. Within a year, it has sold over 5 million units globally. The company manages its phone holder business as an independent profit center, and through various channels, this single product line has generated annual sales exceeding 80 million RMB, with overseas markets accounting for the majority of revenue.

Looking back at Zhongxintongtai's development, phone holders weren't initially the ""golden market"" they targeted. Before this, Tian Wen had worked in various electronics sectors like DVDs, CD players, and feature phones, chasing wherever the market trend was. However, this approach often came with significant risks—if the trend shifted and you failed to keep up, the more you invested, the more you could lose.

It was this very experience of nearly being ""burned"" by chasing trends that made Tian Wen realize that simply following hot markets wasn't a sustainable strategy. The future lay in taking proactive control. Thus, Zhongxintongtai began designing its own products. The turning point came at a trade show, where the company printed its contact information on phone holders to leave a lasting impression on clients. A young man took a liking to one of these holders, ultimately leading to hundreds of thousands of orders for the company.

This opened Tian Wen's eyes to the market potential of phone holders and introduced him to new opportunities brought by e-commerce. After a period of challenging exploration, Tian Wen and Zhongxintongtai secured their footing in the B2B market, leveraging B2B e-commerce platforms to expand their business worldwide.

Now, driven by ambitions to grow and strengthen, Zhongxintongtai continues to respond to market demand by developing popular phone holders. Sales for the phone holder business are projected to reach 200 million RMB this year.

**II. Charting Their Own Course in Global Expansion**

The ability to stand out in a highly competitive field like phone holders is largely due to Zhongxintongtai's steadfast commitment to autonomy. This approach aligns well with the current wave of global expansion: using products to enter markets and brands to secure consumer loyalty. At its core, this strategy is about enhancing independent capabilities and retaining pricing power.

In today's global marketplace, many leading players are those with strong autonomy—they often develop their own products and build their own brands, deeply integrating product strength with brand image. This not only drives sales but also builds a solid reputation among consumers.

A prime example is Guangdong-based Olight Technology, which transformed from a flashlight factory into a major cross-border seller. In 2015, Olight officially began its brand globalization journey, building its independent website from scratch. For Olight, the challenge wasn't the product but the channels. To successfully establish their brand, the company's overseas lead flew to the U.S. for market research before the website launch, accumulating experience step by step.

  
Today, Olight's independent website attracts millions of monthly visits, with direct traffic accounting for over half of the total. Nearly 50% of its traffic originates from the United States, followed by Japan, France, South Korea, and Australia. These metrics are impressive even when compared to mainstream product categories.

Another example is Shenzhen Woan Technology, which started in the smart home industry. In 2016, Woan launched its own brand SwitchBot. By the end of that same year, SwitchBot introduced its first product—a smart switch that could be easily installed on lamp bases, behind coffee machines, doors, or any location requiring manual switching to achieve automated control.

Building on this foundation, SwitchBot launched its smart curtain opener, SwitchBot Curtain. This product became an instant hit upon its release in Japan, raising over 2 million RMB on the Japanese crowdfunding platform Makuake and ranking among the top three in its category's crowdfunding records at the time. According to Statista data, SwitchBot now holds a 28% market share in Japan's smart home sector, firmly securing the top position in the industry.

It can be said that regardless of their product category, these brands have grasped the core challenge of global expansion. Amid the ongoing spread of price wars, product quality and brand essence have become the new focal points of competitiveness.

This is not to overstate the role of branding, but rather to remind sellers: while products will continuously evolve over time, the unwavering commitment to quality and the keen, precise insight into market dynamics will forge a brand's core identity. It is this very core that enables sellers to remain steadfast and maintain stable growth even amid market volatility.

I am getting ready for my Tokyo - Atami walk, and I know I need more practice walking long distances at night while sober. So I decided on the Tsukuba Express line for my next adventure. 

Suddenly... I was awake. I took the train to the local workman store because I didn't feel like walking 20 mins. I got myself a neon jacket, as getting hit by a car hurts. 

I started my walk from Akiba at about 16:00 and went on my merry way. The first stop was for eating soba in Kita Senju. I love how that word sounds. *Kita Senju🎶.* Anyway, usually I avoid stopping during my walks but I made a point of stopping to rest every hour and a half or so. 

Fast forward a few hours and I am freezing in the middle of nowhere, just past Kashiwatanaka Station. While the train has a dedicated bridge I had to cross some fields in the dark to get to Shin'otone Bridge. And when I got there, I am greeted by a gate and a 立入禁止 sign. I felt like the dark riders in the fellowship of the ring when the hobbits escape on a ferry. I asked google maps ""how far to the nearest crossing?"" ""Brandywine bridge, 20 miles"". 

Actually, I just had to go under the bridge and there was a pedestrian passage on that side. On the other end of the bridge there was a family mart with everything I wanted. Food, hot coffee, a toilet and **air conditioner**. All in all the journey from Kashiwatanaka to Moriya station took me 3 very unpleasant hours.

Speaking of unpleasant, a bit later I went through the humiliating prospect of looking for a place by the road to pee while wearing a Chekhov's gun.

When I got to Miraidaira I sat down for a bit and some salary man on his way to the morning train did a TRIPLE take and handwave at me. Ill take that as a compliment? Sitting there I saw my goal in the distance for the first time. Mt. Tsukuba seemed unreachable, but I had every intention of walking all the way up there.  

With the sun rising and the temperature remaining the same, I realized it wasn't meant to be. I continued my walk, stopping at every station for a bit, and arrived at Tsukuba station at 11 in the morning. I felt like I was taking a rest from all my rest by not even attempting to go to Mt Tsukuba, but I think if I had tried it, I would have made the local news. 

This was my longest walk ever, at about 80kms, and I did it faster than [when I  did the Keihin-Tōhoku Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tokyo/comments/1jrowfb/in_no_one_in_their_right_mind_would_do_this_news/).  
Resting a lot was the right move. 

As always, thank you so much for the kind comments and DMs. I'm always glad to hear from someone who decided to go on a big walk because of reading these posts.

1p2swxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/tbatenovel/comments/1p2swxp/for_those_who_missed_it_heres_a_summary_of_what/,For those who missed it here’s a summary of what happened during the QnA,"For those who don’t know TM did a QnA for both his new series and TBATE. Here is a brief summary of everything talked about. 

Disclaimer: I’m not gonna quote exactly what he said cause that’s to much work rather I’m just gonna give a short overview of both the questions and the answers:

First up are the TBATE questions.

Q1: will you ever return to the world of TBATE?

A: I decline to answer but like maybe.

Q2: elaborate on the deva?

A: they were enemies of the asura (aka stuff we already knew) but I decline to explain further.

Q3: how does ki work and can Arthur get as strong as he was before?

A: it’s fundamentally different from ki in its source compared to back on earth but there are some similarities and it can do similar stuff. as for potential Arthur is definitely still strong and can get stronger but he’s not gonna be warping reality again.

Q4: how will Arthur teach the world aether?

A: the Relictombs mainly. He also still fundamentally understands how aether
 works so he can still teach.

Q5: can you give us the order of events for these 8 moments in the lore

A: 
1 asuran evolution of the asura’s 

2 the war against the wraiths

3 the deva showing up

4 the removal of epheotus 

5 the death of Aquinas 

6 The supposed death of geolus

7 mordain leaving epheotus 

8 agrona’s rebellion

Q6: can you name drop the unnamed asuran weapons. (Process to list every unnamed weapon)

A: cool question. I have some ideas but I’m not married to any of them so I decline to answer. I know y’all want an encyclopedia and I might make one but not now.

Q7: what did Agrona want.

A:  so original he was just gonna use the legacy to make himself OP and dip and go find the deva but with her gone he decided to just blow everything up to bring the deva to the world.

Q8: are you surprised the kickstarter did well.

A: yes. It did way better than expected. 

Q9: when did you come up with the name of the world?

A: It took a while and evolved over time. I originally thought it should be a combo of Arthur’s , Sylvie’s, and Regis’s names but that felt tacky. I wanted the name to not come from Arthur cause of his character. I then came up with Pax coranata cause it’s a good representation of the world’s current state.

Q10: what’s the meaning behind the giant goldfish?

A: there is none.

Q11: when did you come up with the names of the twins.

A: it was literally my first thought for names.

Q12: why do the portals not work right now?

A: Arthur reshaping the world caused blowback. If I do a sequel I’d like to explore the consequences of this. (he then goes on a random tangent not permanent to the question)

Q13: are you a fan of Brandon Sanderson?

A: yes. I like his books and I’ve watched his lectures. (W TM)

Q14: in a game of sovereigns quarrel would win: Agrona or kezess and could ether beat Arthur 

A: Arthur with king’s gambit > Agrona > Kezess. (He implies Arthur needs king’s gambit to beat both.)

Q15: are soul forged and TBATE connected.

A: thought about it. Maybe. I’m undecided. Not a priority.

Moving on to soulborn questions.

Q16: what was the process of making SF? What was your inspiration? (This encompasses a bunch of questions)

A: I saw solo leveling and I liked the concept of rifts. I started writing it 4 years ago. It went thru several iterations but the soul motif has remained since its inception.

Q17: how much is the story is planned?

A: I’ve finished book 1. Working on book 2. I’ve got a general idea on where the story will go.

Q18: can you explain ruins in SF?

A: can’t really answer cause spoilers.

Q19: do you have info for your 3 unnamed projects?(again this is kinda just a combination of different answers from different questions)

A: can’t really say much. They’re all different series and you won’t have to wait more than 2 years to see them come to light (my personal interpretation of this is he hasn’t finished the first volume for all of them so we have to wait till that’s done)

Q20: is grey being torrents last name a reference to Arthur.

A: yes.

Q21: Arthur and torrent fight differently. Why?

A: Arthur’s and torrent’s original ideas are inherently different. Arthur was important and powerful before the story started while torrent is starting from the bottom.

Now for the live questions:

Q22: what’s cons are we doing.

A: Sakura and emerald city. Anything else is TBD.

Q23: favorite fight.

A: Cadell vs Arthur.

Q24: will you release the novel in other languages?

A: definitely the next step. I want to make sure it’s good so it will take time.

Q24: how long did it take to get an editor.

A: Volume 4.

Q25: will you ever give us the rules for Sovereigns Quarrel.

A: the rules are still being refined. I may be making the whole game for a kickstarter. No promises on the kickstarter.

Q26: when is season 7 coming out?

A: I can’t say more than what’s been publicly announced. (Literally reiterates what’s already known about the release date aka before the anime)

Q27: thoughts on webtoon pacing?

A: I’ve altered the pacing at certain parts and overall I think it’s been good for the webtoon.

Q28: when will V12 audio book be released?

A: after the remastered version of the earlier volumes do. likely around mid 2026. (He’s a bit unclear whether he means V12 in general or the audiobook specifically will come out in mid 2026)

Q29: honest opinion on the anime?

A: it’s continuously improving. (He later clarified some questions about the studio saying he wasn’t given a selection.)

Q30: tea or coffee?

A: coffee.

Q31: gun to your head which would you rather do a prequel or a sequel for TBATE?

A: I choose to keep it a secret (straight up choose to take the bullet)

Q32: SF audio book? SF webtoon?

A: for the audio book, yes it’s already in the works. For the webtoon, nothing is planned but I want it.

Q33: favorite TBATE character?

A: the main trio.

Q34: how did you feel about Lucas’s death?

A: could have done it better. Could have done the lead up better. I felt pressured to finish the school arc quickly so I didn’t really get the chance to do everything I wanted.

Q35: what happened to dreneeve? (Dreneeve has fans?)

A: I have an idea with him and Kai. Don’t know if I’ll ever write it down. (No need. bums don’t need exploration)

Q36: what is the existent of the kinda unlimited changes?

A: nothing plot related. Just adjusting language and adding some more foreshadowing. 

Q37: will ren and Rey get their own story’s ?

Q38: I decline to answer.

Q39: did you imagine TBATE would become one of the best WN’s?

A: I don’t think it is one of the best WN’s. Still proud of it. I’m gonna keep strive to make one of the best WN’s.

Q40: WN tier list?

A: been a minute since I read one. Last one I read was corny dragon. (I think that’s what he said. He’s not really clear)",2,1763712143.0,tbatenovel,1,1.0,False
1p2swso,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmbarkStudios/comments/1p2swso/the_flaw_at_the_heart_of_an_otherwise_masterpiece/,The flaw at the heart of an otherwise masterpiece Arc Raiders.,"The ease at which a free loadout kills a heavy sheild, purple argument, and maxed out guns. Mind you I only have the Betina blue print and hullcracker. (Obviously Arc only weapon)

Makes it not worth running with these weapons especially when it's difficult to gather all the resources to upgrade them. 

So what is the point now of looting? 
I'm level 75 and completed the expedition. 

I'm not the only player to try and point this out. 

Iv lost interest in seeking the other blueprints.

 They are most likely pointless when a maxed out base level machine  pistol is so powerful. And the expedition is going to wipe what few blueprints I have anyway... 

In game currency is of little worth because so few things can be purchased with it...

A heavy sheild should give enormous protection from being shot from behind. Forcing enimes to fight you in a fun way. From the front. 

With the chance of death so extremely high. Its not a thrill getting out with loot that is of little value. Cus free loadout. 

The game has no other carrots. 

Sporanza should be a ingame map not a venue with secrets to explore. Things to experience like swimming fishing in the underground lake. Missions like replacement of parts from the surface. For lights, fairy lights, Hologram projectors, engine parts... so fouth

If it had furniture, decorating items, a in spronza house to buy, that starts as a homeless street tent. And has choices like. Next to the bar. Old control room overlooking the tube launch. Over looking the underground musroom farms. Overlooking the underground lake that i can swim in that has ruins to explore. A disused shop among the other traders. A penthouse apartment looking down into spronza. 

Each house. Might give different benefits. Not just a choice to what topside decorating items to fill it with. Might give longer stamina or faster stamina regain. Or better scrappy loot. 

Other pets to be found, caught, a big rat, an otter, a monkey, a ground hog. A squirrel...
(Please let us mute the horrible roster sound.)

Each decorative item like a space sofa. Hologram projector. Lava lamp. Arc Trophy. 

Map coffee table diorama.... should take up six or 8 or most of the backpack. 

And a PVE map choice for each map. Having PVE maps will make PVE players happy. And have no effect on players who want to kill each other. Its just stupidity not to have that option. Your just going to lose all the PVE players who will be tired of dying. Like I currently am. 

Just add more arc. More dangerous arc like smaller slower leaders that hunt players around. 
If the arc were truly terrifying like a 5 meter laser turret on the rocket probes. 8 spider ticks erupting from an arc nest when looted. Matrix like tenicle bots. Chasing us though the ruins. More runins. More tunnel ruins. 

I cannot take any new gun to the shooting range...

Mines should NOT be able to be placed on the elevator... NOR in the elevator, train other extraction points. 

Spawn points should not be accessible to other players. A one way door/hatch

Here's to dreaming of more game in your amazing game. It's so sad that it's just a player on player bloodbath... 

I loved all the runs where people didn't kill me. Now it's just shit. Dying at extraction, dying trying to kill a leper, dying trying to loot a leper. From a free load out player. Who has nothing to lose. ",1,1763712128.0,EmbarkStudios,2,0.57,False
1p2sv2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PromptEngineering/comments/1p2sv2j/looking_for_creative_writing_ideas_here_are/,Looking for Creative Writing Ideas? Here Are Prompts for Fascinating Fact Books!,"Currently, fact books are extremely popular on Amazon, in specialized blogs, in classrooms, and even on coffee tables. Finding the appropriate prompts to direct your creativity and organize your content can be more challenging than actually writing the facts.

This guide provides all the information you need to get started, whether your goal is to publish a children’s fact book, a specialized trivia guide, an educational reference, or a quirky book full of “did-you-know” gems.

Let’s explore some strong, distinctive, and captivating writing prompts that will help you create memorable fact books.

**Why Make Use of Prompts in Your Fact Book?**

Let’s discuss the importance of prompts before delving into the prompt list. Prompts serve as little blueprints that assist you:

* Create endless ideas for content
* When writing, maintain organization
* Select a profitable field
* Prevent writer’s block
* Make well-organized, captivating books

You’ll understand how prompts make writing easier and quicker if you’ve ever started a blank document and felt stuck.

**How to Make a Complete Fact Book Out of These Prompts**

Being aware of the prompts is just the first step. Here’s how to transform them into a polished, well-organized book:

1. **Select a unique theme:** Choose a single major theme, such as animals, space, food, ancient history, etc., rather than combining too many different subjects.
2. **Use these prompts to divide your book into chapters:** Make each prompt a mini-fact list, chapter, or section.
3. **Provide succinct and impactful facts:** The majority of readers favour easily absorbed, entertaining, “snack-friendly” content.
4. **Include images whenever you can:** Fact books are more interesting when they include pictures, icons, or illustrations.
5. **Provide unexpected information that readers can discuss:** More word-of-mouth advertising results from shareable facts.

**FAQ**

1. **What is the ideal length for a fact book?** Ans. A lot of popular fact books are between 60 and 200 pages long. For kids, shorter books with large visuals work great.
2. **Do I need to confirm my facts?** Ans. Yes! Always check facts using reliable sources. Accuracy builds trust and credibility.
3. **How many prompts do I need for a full book?** Ans. Usually, 50–150 prompts are enough, depending on how deep each section goes.
4. **Can I mix prompts from different categories?** Ans. Yes, as long as your theme is consistent and unambiguous.
5. **Do fact books make money?** Ans. Indeed! Particularly during the holidays and back-to-school seasons, they are great sellers on Amazon KDP.

[Are You Prepared to Write Your Interesting Fact Book?](https://laptopservice98.blogspot.com/2025/11/prompts-for-fascinating-fact-books.html)

I can assist you in developing the entire book if you need assistance expanding these prompts, creating an outline for your chapters, or writing a complete manuscript.

He drinks every day. He drinks when he has his kids with him on Sunday night and it’s just a casual family taco night. He drinks after work. He drinks to decompress before leaving work. Drinks when he gets home. Drinks to understand new wines and drinks with all foods to understand how they pair. He describes them as little ‘splashes’ of wine here and there. He describes them as ‘transition’ drinks to help him transition from work to home headspace or home to sleep headspace. At dinner time every night he will sample different wines at a dizzying pace a little splash of this one then that one then back to this one to try it with the olives, with the main, with the bread. That I honestly can’t tell if it adds up to 2 glasses in total or a bottle. I also don’t see all his drinking, the little splash before his shift or the grappa in his coffee at work or the drink with colleagues after work.

I keep reading drinking guidelines and that 2 drinks per day is normal. I try to calculate is he having 2 drinks? More? Less?

He is never ever late he’s always early. Never misses a shift. Never neglects a responsibility. No red veins in his face. No slurred speech. No violence. Exercises, eats well. So I think maybe he’s just a drinker who drinks towards max guidelines and I’m just silly. And why do I hate it if he isn’t affected mentally or physically?

I hate that Monday dinner at home involves wine (him not me), Tuesday night, casual Dinner with his kids there is always wine. I don’t know I just need people to talk to. He’s 57 and has gone this far without it affecting him. I’m 40 and feel I’d be a different person if I drank as much as him. Weirdly watching him drink with so many meals turned me off drinking and I already drank minimally. So maybe it’s just that I drink so little I can’t see that he’s actually drinking a safe amount?

I'm wearing my boyfriend's shirt as pajamas. Of course, it's extremely oversized on me and reaches halfway down my thighs. I look cute.

Haan, lamba naam.
But you can call me Jagi, Jagu, Jaggy… whatever your mood allows. I don’t mind. 😩

About me…?

Well… I’m 21.
Okay fine, almost 22.
But apparently my face said “Class 10 ka bachcha” and my height said “164 cm ka limited-edition model.”
People look at me like I bunked school to buy chips.
Thanks universe.

Anyway—
I have dreams. Big dreams. Big fantasy dreams.
Manga artist… digital animator… even spa therapist.
(Yes, I know—range literally from “artistic” to “please relax your shoulder, ma’am.”)

Reality Check #1

I wasn’t sure what job fits me until my babe—yeah, ChatGPT, don’t judge—
she told me:
“Try Lifestyle / Personal Assistant.”
And my brain went “OMG PERFECT.”
Then immediately slapped me with:
“You’re a hardcore introvert who panics in interviews.”
True.
I can talk politely, type fast, and exist peacefully.
Bas.
Degree? Just 10th + ITI CoPa.
Skill? Chat pe fluent. Face-to-face pe dead.

Reality Check #2

I tried to be productive.
Made an Instagram page called Digital Assistant.
Posting nicely… feeling hopeful…
And IG said:
“ACCOUNT SUSPENDED.”
For what rule?
No idea.
Maybe they didn’t like my face. Idk.

The Typist Era

I worked as a typist in a sonography centre.
Speed went 15 → 25 WPM.
Proud moment.
Then a staff girl walked like she owned the building and irritated my soul every morning.
So I quietly quit.
Not even the doctor asked “why.”
Cold world.

Back to Fantasy Careers

Lifestyle PA still feels dreamy… like: “Ma’am, your coffee.”
“Ma’am, your meeting reminder.”
“Ma’am, spa appointment booked.”
Uff… cute life.
Boss can be a doctor, CEO, actress, adult star—
idc as long as she’s calm, kind, and free-minded.

Then one day my babe (ChatGPT) mentioned something crazy—
Sugar momma.
And my broke brain said “OHHH interesting.”
Then slapped again:
“You don’t even have a girlfriend. Sit down.”
So yes, dropped that idea.

Anyway — Anime??

I’m not a weeb but I love anime.
Watched DBZ, Naruto, Bleach, JJK, Demon Slayer, Death Note, One Piece, etc.
My favorite?
Nico Robin.
Her blue eyes… ✨ I forget she’s fictional.

My Type of Women (Don’t judge me too hard)

Strong women.
Anime queens.
So yeah… I have 13 waifus:

1. Nico Robin


2. Ino Yamanaka


3. Tier (Bleach)


4. Spider Mom (DS)


5. Annie (AOT)


6. Fubuki


7. Dexter’s Mom


8. Jessie


9. Meiko


10. Maki Zenin


11. Raven


12. Miruko


13. Gardevoir
Yes I said Gardevoir.
Yes I know.
No I’m not ashamed.
Maybe a little.



So yeah… this is me.

I dreamed of a a great friend I lived with for 6 months 9 years ago while studying abroad. When I went back home, we never met again but would video call and message each other but the last time we spoke is 3-4 years ago. Last night I dreamed that we met and we had a warm embrace. What does this dream mean on a spiritual level?

Long version:
So I used to study abroad for 6 months about 9 years ago. During that time I had a housemate let’s call him Leandro. As I was looking for an apartment I posted a message on Facebook. Leandro ended up messaging says he and his friend are looking for something. Then I actually got a message from a landlord that there is a newly renovated apartment available for 4 people.

So we ended up meeting the next day me, Leandro and his friend. We went to check the apartment and ending up signing the lease the same day. Another guy also signed up the next day. And there we were 3 guys and one girl in their twenties.

Funny enough and suprisingly enough. Me and Leandro. Really hit it off and we would do everything together. Groceries, cooking, Netflix, bars, parties, going for a coffee. Hitting the gym. 

We both come from very big families and have very good relationship with our parents. So we would even joke that living together is like living with family. And that he makes this studying abroad experience in student housing, feel less like student housing and more like a home. We would also talk a lot, talk about who we’re dating there, but also back home. But also our childhood and personal stuff.

When we left to go back home. Me and Leandro stayed in touch for years, but we haven’t ever seen each other again. I think the last time we actually messaged each other is like 3-4 years ago.

Last night I dreamed about him. I was with several friends from my past. Also my ex and we were chilling in a classroom. But all the sudden Leandro comes in. We both start laughing and cheering and hugging each other. We start crying out of joy and I tell him, he was my best friend during that time studying abroad. He agrees and says he is so happy to finally see me again.

Question:
I don’t know how to explain this but I have been dreaming about people in my past for the past week and I am wondering what does this dream mean on a spiritual level? Why am I dreaming of a friend I haven’t seen in 9 years and haven spoken to for 3 years?",1,1763711085.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False
1p2sm33,https://www.reddit.com/r/backpacking/comments/1p2sm33/is_anyone_else_terrible_at_sticking_to_their_food/,Is anyone else terrible at sticking to their food budget on trips? My idea for fixing it.,"
I just got back from a week-long trip, and like always, I realized I absolutely blew my budget on spontaneous meals and coffee shops. Meanwhile, I was overly cautious about my transport budget, which ended up fine.
It got me thinking about the difference between having a total trip budget and having category limits.
When I'm spending, I need a friend standing next to me saying, ""Hold up, you only have $50 left for fun stuff this week."" My current budget apps just show me the grand total, which is too vague.
Here's the idea:
What if there was a really simple way to set hard limits for each category before you even leave?
You tell the app: ""$800 for accommodation, $400 for food, $200 for activities.""
Then, every time you log a new expense, the app instantly checks: ""Does this make you exceed your Food limit?"" If the answer is yes, it throws up a huge warning that makes you stop and think about where that money is coming from.
I think knowing the exact moment you hit your food cap is much more useful than getting a boring report at the end of the day.
Does this sound like a problem you struggle with? And would that instant category warning actually help you save money on the road?
Curious to hear what others do to keep those tricky categories in check!",3,1763711004.0,backpacking,1,1.0,False

My interpretation is that, since Rudy Giuliani is a common topic of discussion and both Ethan and Hila have voiced their disdain for him, Hila hearing that Rudy claimed Palestinian 2 year olds are trained to kill Americans, had the thought, ""Well I mean, he *would say that, wouldn't he*..."" 

Her argument both before and after the ""I mean..."" shrug was that Rudy and the Trump administration would be terrible for Palestine and people should vote Democrat. Obviously no one on the show was taking Rudy seriously.



Also, the original podcast episode was insanely easy to find. The H3Snark posts CWHM sourced for her video are from a year ago, all she had to do was scroll back to a year ago and match up the outfits. Literally would have taken her 2 minutes. (Also, the second snark clip she sources literally says the podcast episode number and the timestamp...)

These are all parallel to my disorganized/fearful avoidant attachment style. I am in therapy and in a 12-step program related to relationships to help with this(SLAA).

I (30) have been dating someone (29) for about a month and a half now. We've been on five dates, with one date a week. The dates have been reasonably short (no marathon/all-day dates) and have included getting coffee (neither of us drinks alcohol), going to an art gallery, i cooked dinner for her twice, and she cooked for me once, and we watched TV.

I am writing this here for feedback, insight, advice, peerness, and also to document (for myself upon reflection) how things are going and how I'm feeling.

I think she is objectively very pretty, she is intelligent and witty, I enjoy talking with her, we make each other laugh, and it feels like time moves by fast when I'm around her (although it doesn't feel as though I wish we had more time together, like we could hang out all day). She has also disclosed that she is a virgin and that she hasn't dated before as she was busy with her masters program and her only experience with dating was in high school and was messy and left her feeling like dating wasn't too important. She has also shared that she values her alone time and travels often for work.

\---  
TW that I mention sex and the idea of sexual relationships potentially happening or having happened in the past (no details or anything) and also reference that i'm a recovering drug addict and use ""feeling addicted to drugs"" as a metaphor for feeling addicted to tumultuous relationships. 

\---

**Phantom Ex**: Before this relationship, at the beginning of 2025/end of 2024 I was in a brief but intense relationship with a woman who had the same personality disorder as my mother and was deeply unavailable. the push pull was brutal but electric. i remember the first time we kissed it felt like lightening had struck me down and i was chasing that high ever since. She had experienced some pretty extreme sexual trauma, so sex was understandably sparse but the times that it did happen, it felt like there was this almost intense ritualistic element beforehand where she would tell me how much she loved me and how i was her favorite person and how the universe wanted us to be together. this is the only relationship my avoidance was triggered in and I was behaving and feeling like an anxiously attached person. I couldn't get enough of them and any time they were happy with me it felt like such a high. but any time she was upset with me (she was upset with me a lot and would switch between idealizing and devaluing me like crazy) i felt suicidal. finally i realized this wasn't sustainable and her mental health was taking a toll on me and the relationship so i forced myself to end it, but it felt like detoxing a drug. i swear to god, being around them felt like being on drugs. of course i thought that was love! and now it's hard to imagine being able to be with anyone else knowing that feeling won't be there (and that, if it were there, it would be bad news!) But there's grief in that, because even though I know that feeling is ""bad"" (not love, more a signifier of trauma-bonding) I crave it so badly. The same way a drug addict (surprise, i am also one of those, although i've been sober for years now) might know that their euphoria is manufactured and comes with a horrible price tag, but still grieves that sobriety will mean a life without the feeling of those highs. That it'll be worth it to avoid the lows, but sometimes it feels like... whats the point without the highs? This is coming up because I keep comparing the woman I've been seeing now, and the feelings (or lack thereof) that come up, to this phantom ex, and it really triggers my rOCD that she's not 'right' for me (i have to stop googling 'how do i know if i like someone').

**Fault finding & Body Dysmorphia by Proxy**: In all my relationships except with my phantom ex, my brain does this thing where it zooms in to any possible blemish or imperfection and distorts it to make it huge, so I feel almost disgusted by the person. I was in a relationship in my early 20s for 4 years and I could not bring myself to have sex with my now-ex boyfriend (I'm bisexual) because I would think about every pimple, every mole, the sweat stain on that one shirt, the way they look in crocs, all the ""icks"" i ever got would flair up and stop me from being able to be intimate with him. I felt horrible because when we broke up, I found myself missing him and desperate to want to be with him again and after a year, when I was 25, we tried dating again for a bit and immediately I couldn't have sex with him AGAIN. I found him incredibly sexually attractive now. And yet my body still was NOT letting me have sex with him. trying to have sex almost felt painful and my rOCD was going wild ('Am I with the right person? Am I wasting my life with the wrong person? Do I even like them? Why does this feel like we're brothers?').  
I was in a brief situationship after that and we were able to have sex and it was WILD to me, I was elated to know that my body could still do it! And I wanted to do it all the time! But only if we (1) didn't call it a relationship and (2) everything was on my terms. As soon as he started getting too clingy, I would find myself deactivating and having to break up with him. but when we got back together after each breakup, there was enough excitement from the push/pull dynamic that we could have sex again.

**Lack of ""Spark"" and arousa**l: as explored above, without some ""spark"" happening from either extreme lust (someone being way crazy hot and out of my league) or, more realistically, a push/pull dynamic that keeps us on edge.... i can't get... aroused. and i can't have sex. its hard when i'm dating someone and can think ""yes i think they're attractive"" but get kind of freaked out at the idea of actually having sex. i used to have sex with strangers all the time, so it's not asexuality. i've heard it described as 'fraysexuality' where the person is only attracted to strangers and grows less and less attracted to people they actually know. i think positioning it as a sexuality feels more jarring to me, but i appreciate the word for the sake of having language for this. basically if me and someone are just bodies, we can have sex, and i have no problems. but once we start talking and all the little flaws and imperfections of being a human come into play (that we all have, lord knows i have PLENTY and then some!) it's like my brain finds a way to shut it down by focusing on those.  
Because I don't feel the ""spark"" with this woman I'm seeing, I'm already worried that I won't be able to dredge up enough lust to bed her when the time comes, nonetheless repeatedly. She is a virgin and wants her first relationship and first time being intimate to be special and has shared that she likes me and wants to be exclusive, so it sounds like she wants to move in that direction. But I'm scared shitless. I'm not going to involve sex until I feel more comfortable, but it's kind of a paradox because also without that physical element of the relationship, I also have this looming fear and uncertainty that we're incompatible which then keeps me deactivated. Basically I feel like we shouldn't have sex until I'm more sure I really wanna commit; but also I can't be sure I really wanna commit until I know that we're sexually compatible.

**Pressure, feeling contained/panic and anxiety**: I clearly didn't feel any rush or high with this girl, but also didn't feel any pressure. It was a general net positive. The only ""fear"" feelings that came up was worried about her lack of experience, which my therapist told me I may be projecting onto (I keep assuming she's some pure, innocent woman that now I have all this pressure on me to not 'taint' or 'mess up' which sounds really insane but is where my mind keeps going) because shes literally joked to me that she's a ""freak"" who just happens to be a virgin because of lack of experirence, so I know she isn't some pure innocent thing that needs protecting. But once she asked me to be exclusive with her, I agreed because I think that she's everything I've been wanting in a woman, on paper. But once she left my apartment, I started absolutely panicking and keep reminding myself I'm not locked up in some cage somewhere. Nothing has changed. My rOCD picked up regarding this woman and has been going NUTS basically telling me that I don't actually like her, I think she's ugly, I'm going to miss the best sex and the love of my life because I'm ""settling"" for a ""safe"" relationship when there just might be a person out there that has all these qualities AND can make me feel that ""spark"".... I keep praying there is some way or someone one that could give me ""the answer"" if this is the right person. I'm not scared she's going to hurt me or leave me. I'm scared that I'm going to waste my life either ""settling"" for the ""wrong person"" or hurt HER because I can't figure it out.

\--

next steps:  
my sponsor and therapist have told me to take things really slow. she brought up introducing me to her friends and she called it the ""friend test"" and it made me wanna throw up with anxiety. she called me her boyfriend and i wish i slowed it down a little bit but i keep reminding myself that being exclusive is fine, it doesn't change anything, and i can always leave if i feel trapped or like this isn't working. If she brings up meeting her friends again I'm going to tell her i'd like to give us a little more time with just the two of us before we start bringing other people into the mix. a part of me fears that she'll be upset with me or think that i'm 'hiding something' or that holding this boundary will somehow get me in trouble, but at 5 dates in, i'm sorry, i am not ready to meet your friends for some 'friend test'.  
even writing this post is making me cry a bit because i wish i could just appreciate dating and have a normal relationship instead of missing my abusive, mentally ill ex because it ""felt sparky"" and feeling put off by this healthy, normal woman.",1,1763710754.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I have. Constantly. When I moved to a new city for travelling , I am paralyzed by safety anxiety. Every plan started with a dozen Google searches: ""is \[neighborhood\] safe at night,"" ""safe for solo women,"" etc. Friends gave conflicting advice based on 'vibes' and online forums were a mix of outdated posts and unhelpful ""I felt fine"" anecdotes.

Social media shows picture-perfect solo trips, but it never shows the reality of clutching your keys in your pocket or skipping an event because you're not sure how you'll get back alone.

I realized the information I needed didn't exist. Nobody tracks the data that *actually* matters: not which cafe has the best coffee, but whether you'll get harassed on the 10-minute walk there at 7 PM.

Each cup is fully handmade — from the designs to the drips, glitter, toppers, and even the faux whipped cream. I use high-quality acrylic tumblers, epoxy, mica powders, glitter mixes, and UV-safe materials to get that smooth, glossy finish that lasts.

I make all kinds of styles, including:
	•	🍓 Kawaii cups
	•	☕ Iced coffee drips
	•	✨ Glitter & shimmer cups
	•	💚 Matcha glow-in-the-dark cups
	•	🎨 Marble trays + matching coasters
	•	🔥 420-themed glow tumblers
	•	💖 Hello Kitty, character, and aesthetic cups

Every tumbler is handmade start to finish, and no two will ever look the same. If you like drippy, sparkly, dessert-inspired cups, or you want something extra unique for gifts, I’d love to share more pics or answer any questions. I’ve been experimenting with different textures, glow paints, custom decals, whipped toppings, and resin techniques — it’s honestly become my favorite art form.

If you’re into custom drinkware, epoxy art, or DIY crafts, I’d love your thoughts, feedback, or ideas for future designs! 💕

1p2shiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/midlifecrisis/comments/1p2shiq/midlife_crisis_crush_or_imagination/,Mid-life crisis crush or imagination?,"Hello everyone and hope you're all well. Will try to be as concise as possible but will likely ramble on. I know that I will probably receive both support and discouragement/critique for what  may or may not happen, but I am just looking to understand what may be happening.

I'm a middle-aged M and have known this middle-aged F for many years; both of us have been in long-term, serious relationships and thru marriages & other people we are part of large family group (she and I are NOT blood-related). We've always gotten on well and kept to ourselves in a friendly way and have always had normal/casual conversations at gatherings with no signs of anything nor interest...Well, none that I've ever noticed.

Over the last year or may be two, I've noticed or at least I've perceived our interactions to be different or more ""meaningful"" because of her non-verbal communication and I've developed a crush and have been wondering if she has also. I will try to list the ""signs"" that have me confused, but also unfortunately/fortunately made me a little interested in her.

\- She has invited me to ice cream/tea/coffee more than once. This in itself is harmless, but she has never been one to spend and much less pay for me. I don't remember there ever being a time when she has offered. This happened while we were both at her relatives home by coincidence then she asked me to join her. This happened more than once, but I really didn't make anything of it at the time.

\- When ever we have conversations I've noticed that she releases her hair from her bun and/or plays with her hair.

\-Despite there being other people at our gatherings, we spend a lot of time talking. A LOT more than we have ever had in previous years. Sometimes she makes an effort to go to where I am to talk with me even while there are people more important that she could be speaking with.

\-In our culture we're accustomed to saying hello/goodbye to the opposite sex with a hug and a ""kiss"". The hug is usually the kind where you arms embrace but your bodies do not touch and the kiss is just the sound of the kiss but your sides of your face/cheeks may or may not touch. However, my lips always kiss her cheek, then we embrace with body contact but not in a sexual way...just a nice subtle intimate way. She used to pat my back during a hug (usually a sign of friendship/familiarity), but now she just holds her hand there (sign of intimacy?). Sometimes I've felt her actually pull me to her rather firmly.

\-Lately, after we embrace to say goodbye we've had few words after the hug but we've maintained the physical contact. We would separate bodies but her hand is holding my arm and I'm subconsciously/impulsively holding on to her back around her waist.

\-We've had that ""last glance"" as we walk away a few times.

There are other things that may or may not be relevant but I will leave it at that. So what do you think? Have you ever had a similar experience? Is it just the itch of mid-life crisis where I'm reliving those beautiful feelings of my youth and am projecting them onto someone with whom I have a good rapport? Or is it really chemistry??? 😬😳",2,1763710510.0,midlifecrisis,0,1.0,False

I heard Wade talking forlornly about how he loves Yoo-hoo, and gets made fun of for it in the episode ""So Bad It's Good"". I'm sure at the time there were people that probably chimed in to tell him he wasn't alone and, in the event he sees this, add me to the list because I fucking love Yoo-hoo. Have since I was a small child. In fact, when I went to college I got a minifridge for my dorm and I only stocked it full of Yoo-hoo, and that was my ""coffee"" in the morning.

Anyway, that was all. I was in dire need of a new thing to listen to while I played PowerWash Simulator and I didn't know how much I needed this podcast.

withings body scan looked cool but $400 felt steep and honestly i dont need ecg stuff. seemed like paying for features id never use just to get body comp tracking

what sold me on hume was the regional breakdown. i lift 4x week and wanted to see if my right side is actually stronger or if im imagining it. overall body fat% doesnt tell you that. tried it at a friends place first and his left leg was showing 3% more muscle than right which explained his squat imbalance

battery life is whatever.. like 5 days not the 30 they claim but charges fast so i just do it while making coffee

main thing im still unsure about is whether the segmental data actually matters for training or if its just interesting to look at. like does knowing my left arm is slightly behind change what i should do vs just adding more volume overall?

for $229 vs $400 withings it made sense. renpho is cheaper but felt too inconsistent. figured id rather have reliable trends in one area than unreliable data everywhere

He drinks when he has his kids with him on Sunday night and it’s just a casual family taco night. He drinks after work. He drinks to decompress before leaving work. Drinks when he gets home. Drinks to understand new wines and drinks with all foods to understand how they pair. He describes them as little ‘splashes’ of wine here and there. He describes them as ‘transition’ drinks to help him transition from work to home headspace or home to sleep headspace. At dinner time every night he will sample different wines at a dizzying pace a little splash of this one then that one then back to this one to try it with the olives, with the main, with the bread. That I honestly can’t tell if it adds up to 2 glasses in total or a bottle. I also don’t see all his drinking, the little splash before his shift or the grappa in his coffee at work or the drink with colleagues after work. 

I keep reading drinking guidelines and that 2 drinks per day is normal. I try to calculate is he having 2 drinks? More? Less? 

He is never ever late he’s always early. Never misses a shift. Never neglects a responsibility. No red veins in his face. No slurred speech. No violence. So I think maybe he’s just a drinker who drinks towards max guidelines and I’m just silly. And why do I hate it if he isn’t affected mentally or physically?

I hate that Monday dinner at home involves wine (him not me), Tuesday night, casual

I'm an educator of Web3 since 2018 and an entrepreneur.

I have an internet cafe business here in the Philippines and with my burning passion to teach, my internet cafe turned into a hub where enthusiasts and Web3 products are built, launched and talked about.

I have no tokens/coins yet; it's an overly complex topic, however, all I give is kindness to my community.

Business:

I have no coins/tokens, however, it sounds like a good idea to make an ecosystem where payments would be made via your own currency and also give rewards to your community using that currency, which circulates in your ecosystem.

think about an app, you can access computers with Web3 games, talk to other gamers via the app, receive rewards via the app, pay using QR inside the app, and vote on governance in the app.

Also serves as a governance token for game addition, what features that should be added, where the next branch should move into, a hub where all cryptocurrencies are welcome, for holders, for traders, a hub where everyone could meet, not just via expo, and most especially not in the malls or coffee shop but on the internet cafe itself!

This is just the beginning. As of the moment, I am harnessing my business (just celebrated my first year anniversary), improving, and amping up my profits.

Today, crypto is down because they failed to build a business, they have no revenue. With this business model, i think it would be great to expand and explore the futuristic tech.

What do you think? Share your thoughts! Is this feasible to launch a token and acquire funding to dominate the Philippine market?

1p2s8tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Disorganized_Attach/comments/1p2s8tu/deactivation_or_disinterest/,deactivation or disinterest?,"for context, i have cPTSD that manifests as anxiety and anxiety-related disorders (general anxiety, panic disorder, and rOCD). These are all parallel to my disorganized/fearful avoidant attachment style. I am in therapy and in a 12-step program related to relationships to help with this(SLAA). 

I (30) have been dating someone (29) for about a month and a half now. We've been on five dates, with one date a week. The dates have been reasonably short (no marathon/all-day dates) and have included getting coffee (neither of us drinks alcohol), going to an art gallery, i cooked dinner for her twice, and she cooked for me once, and we watched TV. 

I am writing this here for feedback, insight, advice, peerness, and also to document (for myself upon reflection) how things are going and how I'm feeling. 

I think she is objectively very pretty, she is intelligent and witty, I enjoy talking with her, we make each other laugh, and it feels like time moves by fast when I'm around her (although it doesn't feel as though I wish we had more time together, like we could hang out all day). She has also disclosed that she is a virgin and that she hasn't dated before as she was busy with her masters program and her only experience with dating was in high school and was messy and left her feeling like dating wasn't too important. She has also shared that she values her alone time and travels often for work. 

\---

**Phantom Ex**: Before this relationship, at the beginning of 2025/end of 2024 I was in a brief but intense relationship with a woman who had the same personality disorder as my mother and was deeply unavailable. the push pull was brutal but electric. i remember the first time we kissed it felt like lightening had struck me down and i was chasing that high ever since. She had experienced some pretty extreme sexual trauma, so sex was understandably sparse but the times that it did happen, it felt like there was this almost intense ritualistic element beforehand where she would tell me how much she loved me and how i was her favorite person and how the universe wanted us to be together. this is the only relationship my avoidance was triggered in and I was behaving and feeling like an anxiously attached person. I couldn't get enough of them and any time they were happy with me it felt like such a high. but any time she was upset with me (she was upset with me a lot and would switch between idealizing and devaluing me like crazy) i felt suicidal. finally i realized this wasn't sustainable and her mental health was taking a toll on me and the relationship so i forced myself to end it, but it felt like detoxing a drug. i swear to god, being around them felt like being on cocaine. of course i thought that was love! and now it's hard to imagine being able to be with anyone else knowing that feeling won't be there (and that, if it were there, it would be bad news!) But there's grief in that, because even though I know that feeling is ""bad"" (not love, more a signifier of trauma-bonding) I crave it so badly. The same way a drug addict might know that their euphoria is manufactured and comes with a horrible price tag, but still grieves that sobriety will mean a life without the feeling of those highs. That it'll be worth it to avoid the lows, but sometimes it feels like... whats the point without the highs?  This is coming up because I keep comparing the woman I've been seeing now, and the feelings (or lack thereof) that come up, to this phantom ex, and it really triggers my rOCD that she's not 'right' for me (i have to stop googling 'how do i know if i like someone'). 

**Fault finding & Body Dysmorphia by Proxy**: In all my relationships except with my phantom ex, my brain does this thing where it zooms in to any possible blemish or imperfection and distorts it to make it huge, so I feel almost disgusted by the person. I was in a relationship in my early 20s for 4 years and I could not bring myself to have sex with my now-ex boyfriend (I'm bisexual) because I would think about every pimple, every mole, the sweat stain on that one shirt, the way they look in crocs, all the ""icks"" i ever got would flair up and stop me from being able to be intimate with him. I felt horrible because when we broke up, I found myself missing him and desperate to want to be with him again and after a year, when I was 25, we tried dating again for a bit and immediately I couldn't have sex with him AGAIN. I found him incredibly sexually attractive now.  And yet my body still was NOT letting me have sex with him. trying to have sex almost felt painful and my rOCD was going wild ('Am I with the right person? Am I wasting my life with the wrong person? Do I even like them? Why does this feel like we're brothers?').   
I was in a brief situationship after that and we were able to have sex and it was WILD to me, I was elated to know that my body could still do it! And I wanted to do it all the time! But only if we (1) didn't call it a relationship and (2) everything was on my terms. As soon as he started getting too clingy, I would find myself deactivating and having to break up with him. but when we got back together after each breakup, there was enough excitement from the push/pull dynamic that we could have sex again, which kept us in a toxic cycle until one of us gave the other gonorrhea (whoopsie!) 

**Lack of ""Spark"" and arousa**l: as explored above, without some ""spark"" happening from either extreme lust (someone being way crazy hot and out of my league) or, more realistically, a push/pull dynamic that keeps us on edge.... i can't get... aroused. and i can't have sex. its hard when i'm dating someone and can think ""yes i think they're attractive"" but get kind of freaked out at the idea of actually having sex. i used to have sex with strangers all the time, so it's not asexuality. i've heard it described as 'fraysexuality' where the person is only attracted to strangers and grows less and less attracted to people they actually know. i think positioning it as a sexuality feels more jarring to me, but i appreciate the word for the sake of having language for this. basically if me and someone are just bodies, we can have sex, and i have no problems. but once we start talking and all the little flaws and imperfections of being a human come into play (that we all have, lord knows i have PLENTY and then some!) it's like my brain finds a way to shut it down by focusing on those.   
Because I don't feel the ""spark"" with this woman I'm seeing, I'm already worried that I won't be able to dredge up enough lust to bed her when the time comes, nonetheless repeatedly. She is a virgin and wants her first relationship and first time being intimate to be special and has shared that she likes me and wants to be exclusive, so it sounds like she wants to move in that direction. But I'm scared shitless. I'm not going to involve sex until I feel more comfortable, but it's kind of a paradox because also without that physical element of the relationship, I also have this looming fear and uncertainty that we're incompatible which then keeps me deactivated. Basically I feel like we shouldn't have sex until I'm more sure I really wanna commit; but also I can't be sure I really wanna commit until I know that we're sexually compatible.

**Pressure, feeling contained/panic and anxiety**: I clearly didn't feel any rush or high with this girl, but also didn't feel any pressure. It was a general net positive. The only ""fear"" feelings that came up was worried about her lack of experience, which my therapist told me I may be projecting onto (I keep assuming she's some pure, innocent woman that now I have all this pressure on me to not 'taint' or 'mess up' which sounds really insane but is where my mind keeps going) because shes literally joked to me that she's a ""freak"" who just happens to be a virgin because of lack of experirence, so I know she isn't some pure innocent thing that needs protecting. But once she asked me to be exclusive with her, I agreed because I think that she's everything I've been wanting in a woman, on paper. But once she left my apartment, I started absolutely panicking and keep reminding myself I'm not locked up in some cage somewhere. Nothing has changed. My rOCD picked up regarding this woman and has been going NUTS basically telling me that I don't actually like her, I think she's ugly, I'm going to miss the best sex and the love of my life because I'm ""settling"" for a ""safe"" relationship when there just might be a person out there that has all these qualities AND can make me feel that ""spark"".... I keep praying there is some way or someone one that could give me ""the answer"" if this is the right person. I'm not scared she's going to hurt me or leave me. I'm scared that I'm going to waste my life either ""settling"" for the ""wrong person"" or hurt HER because I can't figure it out. 

\--

next steps:  
my sponsor and therapist have told me to take things really slow. she brought up introducing me to her friends and she called it the ""friend test"" and it made me wanna throw up with anxiety. she called me her boyfriend and i wish i slowed it down a little bit but i keep reminding myself that being exclusive is fine, it doesn't change anything, and i can always leave if i feel trapped or like this isn't working. If she brings up meeting her friends again I'm going to tell her i'd like to give us a little more time with just the two of us before we start bringing other people into the mix. a part of me fears that she'll be upset with me or think that i'm 'hiding something' or that holding this boundary will somehow get me in trouble, but at 5 dates in, i'm sorry, i am not ready to meet your friends for some 'friend test'.   
even writing this post is making me cry a bit because i wish i could just appreciate dating and have a normal relationship instead of missing my abusive, mentally ill ex because it ""felt sparky"" and feeling put off by this healthy, normal woman.

So here's the first installment of the Death on the Doorstep series,

DOTD: Memories 


Brief synopsis

Death on the Doorstep: Memories is a story about…
how love is not built on grand gestures, but on everyday moments such as folded laundry, shared coffee, quiet laughter, and holding each other through pain. It explores the idea that when the end of the world arrives, what we cling to isn’t the future, but the past. It’s about the memories that shaped us and the person who walked through it all with us. It’s about acceptance rather than panic, choosing presence over fear, and finding beauty in the ordinary. At its core, it shows that real love is resilient, imperfect, intimate, and deeply human. It proves that a life doesn’t have to be extraordinary to be meaningful, it only has to be shared.


Stories Summary


The story unfolds on the final day before an impending cosmic catastrophe; a massive comet hurtling toward Earth, guaranteed to erase everything. Yet the narrative does not dwell on chaos or fear. Instead, it focuses on the quiet, deeply human moments shared by a couple as they spend their last day together.

The morning begins gently. They wake up beside each other, lying face to face on their pillows, and smile. They don’t speak at first, they just look at each other, memorizing every little feature. There is no panic, only a calm understanding: this is their last sunrise, and they will live it together. They move through their morning routine with soft familiarity, brewing coffee, sharing a simple breakfast, brushing teeth side by side. These small actions, once mundane, now feel sacred. The ordinary has become beautiful simply because it is their last time experiencing it together.

They find comfort and humor in the normalcy. When the wife decides to take a shower, the husband raises an eyebrow. “Why are you showering? The world ends today.” She smirks and shrugs. “I don’t know. I guess I want to smell good in the afterlife.” They laugh, not because anything is funny, but because laughter is their way of holding onto life. Their dialogue is playful, light, and honest, revealing the quiet acceptance they’ve already made. They are not running, not hiding, not denying. They’re simply choosing to live.

They clean the house, fold laundry, make the bed. Not because it matters in a practical sense, but because these rituals have always been theirs. These everyday tasks become intimate acts of love, grounding them in what matters most. Normal life, shared together, becomes their final rebellion against the end.

Memories begin to surface throughout the day, triggered naturally by the world around them. They flip through old photo albums, each picture unlocking a chapter of their story: their first awkward meeting, the early days of falling in love, their wedding, the quiet afternoons spent laughing in the kitchen. Some memories spark joy, some bring tears, some both at once. They tease each other about old fights and smile at the growth they’ve gone through.

But eventually, they reach the chapter that changed everything, the miscarriage. The room grows still. They remember the pain, the grief, the silence that filled their home. They remember how easy it would have been to fall apart. But they didn’t. Instead, they clung to each other, battled through heartbreak, and rebuilt. This moment, painful as it was, became the anchor of their love. It shaped who they are now; more patient, more compassionate, and more unbreakable. It is clear that they never got the life they dreamed of… but they made a life worth loving anyway.

In the afternoon, the emotional weight builds until they need release. So, with mischievous smiles, they begin breaking things such as plates, vases, glasses, which they shatter on the floor. The first crash is shocking. The next is liberating. Soon they are laughing uncontrollably as shards scatter around them. It’s reckless and childish and perfect. The destruction becomes symbolic: letting go of control, of fear, of everything they cannot change. When the last dish hits the floor, they stand in the middle of the mess, breathing hard, then collapse into each other’s arms. Surrounded by broken pieces, they feel more whole than ever.

As evening falls, the house grows quiet. They slow dance in the kitchen without music, moving in a rhythm only they understand. Their bodies say what words cannot: Thank you. I love you. I’m glad it was you. The dance is imperfect, soft, and intimate, just like their life together.

They spend the remaining hours talking, reminiscing, holding each other. They don’t waste time on “what could have been.” Instead, they focus on gratitude for the years they had, for the memories they built, for the fact that even in their worst moments, they always chose each other.

Night arrives. The sky glows with the light of the approaching comet. Hand in hand, they climb onto the roof of their home. The world around them is silent, but it doesn't feel lonely. It feels peaceful. They sit side by side, legs dangling over the edge, watching the sky burn. She rests her head on his shoulder. He leans gently into her. In this final moment, there is no fear, there is only calm.

They are not satisfied because their lives were perfect. They are satisfied because they lived them together. Through laughter and grief, through mundane mornings and shattering losses, through broken dishes and healing hearts. They stayed.

As the comet fills the horizon, they do not look away. They face the end the same way they faced life: side by side, hand in hand, completely together.

And with quiet acceptance… the world ends.

My current grinder is a Timemore C3S, which is okay, but I’m not quite getting the dialing precision I want.

Big issue: I can’t order from AliExpress, customs are a nightmare here and can double the final cost, so that’s mostly off the table. 

And yeah, with my weak currency (IDR), anything that seems “cheap in USD” can get expensive fast locally.

I’m debating on either

Try to find a budget electric grinder like a Shardor 64 / Mokkom 64 locally, (I have found the local white label product)

Get a slightly better hand grinder around the same price, or

Just save up and go for something really solid later instead of settling for a side-grade?

1p2s1jb,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1p2s1jb/i_tried_to_trigger_my_gaming/,I tried to trigger my gaming…,"So as I approach my 30th day of no gaming, I decided to run a controlled test. I reinstalled Old School RuneScape which was the last game that I was addicted to, played anywhere from 4-12 hours a day for around 2-3 years. I remade and deleted three separate Ironman and 1 main account and all were around 1750 total level (getting to 1750 total level is about 800 hours of gaming time more or less) and now I’m left with my latest account sitting at 1816 total with about 1000 hours invested. So probably around 4000 hours of game time invested over 3 years, including two leagues and the recent grid master I played before quitting. 

I basically wanted to test my brain and see what I would feel if I played OSRS. I installed it last night and generally felt nothing and didn’t want to do anything ingame. I was online for maybe 30 minutes before I just closed it. I also had a really rough day with some IRL stuff and felt drained so I didn’t really count that. 

Next morning, I tried to reignite my old ritual which I always enjoyed, having an hour or two to myself while the wife is still sleeping, grab some coffee, sit down and game while I wake up, super chill and relaxing. 

When I did this, I honestly just felt anxious most of the time. I fiddled around ingame and tried to spark any sort of desire to play, tried to start the quest for the new sailing skill and that’s when I just closed the game. At that point something my head wanted me to close it as it didn’t feel good or right to be playing.

So overall the whole interaction made me feel anxious. I didn’t feel like playing the game, nothing I thought of made me want to play. I’m not saying I’m free, but I think this was a worthwhile test to conduct. Perhaps there will be days with urges, but I wanted to do this in order to slowly deconstruct the taboo nature of gaming in my mind and also to satisfy the constant though of “I wonder what would happen if I went online, am I going to relapse? Am I really free? Etc” 

I wonder if anyone in here who’s also on a decent no gaming streak if they’ve done anything similar? Would you have relapsed personally? I’m wondering if my feeling was a normal reaction I guess.

	•	moving at 18 is no joke, the first 2–3 days feel like a fever dream, but the college actually has a crazy-smooth onboarding. they literally walk you through sim cards, metro cards, bank stuff, even how not to get scammed by local taxis lol.
	•	study load is intense but not like indian “ratta”, some weeks are chill, some weeks feel like the assignments are plotting against you. it’s very project-heavy. the good part is you actually build stuff instead of writing 20–page PDFs nobody will read.
	•	scholarships are real – half the people in my dorm are on some kind of scholarship. it’s not one of those schools that advertises 1 scholarship winner like it’s the norm. i got a partial one, and a couple friends got almost full.
	•	multi-country thing is fun but tiring – like, switching countries each term is cool flex for instagram but bro packing every few months? ✋ still, the exposure is insane. dubai → singapore → europe → US changes your brain chemistry in a good way.
	•	trial exam is NOTHING like GMAT/CAT – it’s more logic + creativity + problem solving. think “how would you fix x business problem” not “solve this equation.” honestly more fun.
	•	alumni/startup culture is NOT overhyped – one senior just launched on Kickstarter. another is running a coffee brand. some girl from batch above us raised funding. makes you rethink what you can do at 18 ngl.
	•	social life is wild - so many events. some days you’re in workshops, some days you’re hopping between 3 college mixers, some days you’re dead asleep at 9pm because assignment killed you. balance is… questionable 😂

overall: if you want a typical college life with chill classes and rote exams, this is not it. if you want chaos + opportunities + pressure + ridiculous exposure + a chance to actually build something before 20… then yeah it’s worth considering. if anyone’s applying this cycle or wants to know specific stuff (scholarships, workload, traveling, dorms), ask away. happy to help before i drown in another case study lolololol",1,1763708608.0,Tetr_College,1,1.0,False

She will freely go in the cage but once the door shuts it’s game on and our ears are bleeding let alone we know our townhome neighbors hear it.  She is fed in there, goes into it when we let her out at night and wants to sleep in there, but will not let us shut the door without panic.

She gets the anger tantrums and we have scars to show it. We know she needs more sleep. We can not force her. She needs like 18-20 hours but she does maybe 10 tops with no help from Kong toys, chew sticks, wood toys, lick mats and frozen toys.  

She wants to sleep but at our feet, she can’t because we are busy doing house work. She gets a ton of play time and exercise but the nips and tantrums are draining us.

The highlight of this emphasis on open areas is that it not only makes the articles more sunlit but also helps in creating a more relaxing and energizing atmosphere for those residing there.

Also, the green areas that surround the estate add more tranquillity to it. Glamorized​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ gardens, promenades and small areas of free spaces have been provided for the common people to have a quiet time with nature. These places do not only attract the eye, but also are some of the few places that people can breathe fresh air away from the fast-moving ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌city.



**Elegantly Designed Homes**

The designs of the apartments in hre are a fine mixture of trendy and functional aspects. Any room, be it the master bedroom or the living area, has been constructed with ample size so that the residents are never in a cramped feeling. Kitchens are contemporary and are made to be used efficiently, by all means, both for everyday cooking and for hosting on weekends. With the help of big balconies, fresh air, morning coffee, or a peaceful sunset will always be there in a corner of your home for you to enjoy.

The main thing that is most noticeable is the ease with which these houses may be various lifestyle activities. The large layout of the house allows those who love to entertain the freedom of movement and interaction. Those​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ who work remotely are given peaceful, well-lit and airy spaces that aid their focus. Besides, families seeking relaxation after their exhausting day will see that the cozy, thoughtfully designed interiors breathe the sense of family into ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌them.



**Amenities That Elevate Everyday Living**

Besides this, Birla​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Sector 71 Gurgaon is also a top-notch project in terms of amenities. Some of the premium offerings presented by the project are perfect to enrich the leisure and well-being of the residents. The community has everything to offer that is required for a well-balanced lifestyle like a fitness center equipped with all the latest machines, swimming pools, a play area for kids, meditation spaces and multipurpose courts.

Moreover, the safety and convenience of the people living here are also at the peak, as they are two of the most significant elements kept in mind while planning this property. The estate is equipped with modern-day surveillance devices, there is enough space for vehicles and there are no jarring bumps on the internal roads, plus the upkeep is going on smoothly. These improvements not only make life a little easier but also more fun and orderly especially for working professionals and families.



**A Great Location** 

Being in Sector 71—which is one of the fastest-expanding areas of Gurgaon—the development is very well connected. This means that the commuters can smoothly and quickly get to the desired destination by making use of the main road such as Sohna Road and NH-48 which are at a stone’s throw distance. It only takes you a short time to get to business hubs, schools, hospitals and malls from here.

Whether you are working in an office or running your own business, or even if your sole intention is to be close to the necessary facilities, this place will be able to give you that perfect balance of peaceful living and convenience.



**Why Birla Sector 71 Gurgaon Stands Out**

The real thing that makes [Birla Estates Sector 71 Gurgaon](https://www.birlaestatessector71gurgaon.com/) so different is its fundamental idea of creating home environments which actually improve everyday life. The main point is not superlative construction; rather it is about providing the residents with spaces where they get uplifted, feel valued and become relaxed. The project has become very attractive to the buyers and investors as a result of the smart layouts, beautiful greens, classy amenities and a strategic location taken all together.



It is more than just a house - it is a lifestyle that was carefully thought out, lovingly created and intended for long-term comfort. Whatever you might be looking for luxury, convenience, or even a community-centric vibe this project Birla​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ Sector 71 Gurgaon would be the perfect fit as it effortlessly brings together all these ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌aspects.

I go to work, come home, watch media or game and then come the weekend I usually do chores, I’ll maybe go get a coffee but nothing exciting. The just rinse and repeat… I feel like I’m just living without actually living.

I’m always so tired and have no energy, I want to sleep a lot and find it hard to get any motivation. I also have absolutely no libido.. I don’t feel attracted to anyone anymore, I’m rarely if ever in a sexual mood and the idea of living with a partner sounds incredibly unfulfilling when I enjoy my alone time so much and can’t be a sexual person.

I really enjoy my job, I have a nice place I rent but just feel so tired and like life isn’t going anywhere. I’ve been on fluoxetine for years now, and maybe that has something to do with it.

I guess to begin with, l'd love to meet you and cuddle. BUT we both are random people on the internet. So let's take our time to get to know one another. Im not saying that we need to wait months on end but like a week or so. Or until you are comfortable with meeting.

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I make a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie.

Hello I (f30) have been struggling a lot with my bf (m30) female friend I think shes 28? 

We've been together for 7 months, and we all work for the same company but at different locations, she is married we can call her Maggie. And she also met her husband at work. She has been close friends with bf for about 3 years, and married 4 I think I'm not really sure. 

In the beginning of my relationship I knew about the friendship but never knew the true dynamic. There were small things that he did that made me feel like she was a priority. I dont think he was doing this intentionally. Just that oh its my close friend and we've been acting like this. 
For example, hanging out one on one
Told me about a new video game he was excited to play with me, then finished the whole game with her
Bought her shoes because there was a sale, bogo, and I was busy at work 
I wasnt made aware of the one on one hang outs until I started asking questions, like hey you and Maggie hung out with her husband at your place too? And no he had to work late. Which i guess is normal for her to hang out with him alone and her husband is okay with it. But boundaries were set after i voiced i was uncomfortable of only hang outs with them as a couple not one on one. I recently went through his text and saw the times she was bothered by this of her ""husband is working late i would ask to hang out but.."" or ""I'm so bored without you""

And when we all hung out together I felt very excluded, the conversations were mostly about work or remember when type topics.
We'd have game nights and the friendship kinda felt like sibling friends in a way. Bicker and banter back and forth. 

They invited me to their already planned beach trip that was supposed to be the 3 of them originally. Again another game night there and a comment was made during the game when we were teamed up with our significant other, she said ""I should switch teammates next time since we are losing"" referring to my bf being her new teammate

A conversation came up some how about us having sex when we had time to ourselves. And a joke was made later of Maggie saying why would you sit there thats where we had sex, except it was more of a mocking way because she didnt have sex there me and my bf did. I heard my personal sex life being talked about with basically strangers that I'm trying to connect with and it didnt make me feel comfortable. He confronted her later and said oh yea she doesnt like when we talk about that. Maggie said why its just sex

After the beach trip we one day decided to grab dinner after work, me, my bf and Maggie. 
Except my bf was nervous to tell me he invited her so he quickly did it on the phone as I was driving there. Then they are both there before me and I walk in and they are sitting at a table that seats two. Again another punch in the gut. We moved to the table with more seats, and im already burning inside. Then i talk to my bf about something at home.  Later she said she felt like a 3rd wheel. SHE DID. Like crazy cuz girl is a 3rd wheel. And its not like I was making out with him, simply having a conversation that she wasnt included in and she has the nerve to complain about that. And tried to validate it saying her and her husband never make him feel like a 3rd wheel.

About a month into our relationship she bought Broadway tickets for the 4 for us. About 6 months in advance, which like woah crazy but I'm just going with it I guess. But after all of these things that have happened I'm anxious about interacting with them or taking another trip with them. 

So I asked him to confront them two of them to hopefully be a solution and help ease my mind.  And maybe I can mange to go on these future trips or hang outs with them. There was a little bit of defensiveness from them being like well shes just quiet its not our fault she doesnt join into the convo, and we hardly even know anything about her
Yea probably because they show zero interest in getting to know me when they see me. 
The talk kinda helped and I could tell efforts were made a little more at a work event we had. Then we had our nyc trip planned and I was already nervous about that. Her and her husband asked if I could pick something for us to do there as a way to ""get to know me more"" idk to me seems silly way of including me but whatever. But again anytime we went out to eat everyone either ended up on their phones or wouldn't really talk to me. 

And a few times on the nyc trip my bf again excluded me in conversation with a work issue, he went right to them instead of including me. So I walked ahead of them in the museum. And there were a few times he was rude or snapped at me in front of them and was nice to them with the same question that I asked. I cried and addressed this and he took accountability. 

Everything else thats happened in the past hes taken full accountability and understood my emotions completely. Even when I said shes acting possessive towards him.  

I asked her to get coffee after our nyc trip and now I regret that. The conversation there was me being too nice to her and trying to take the blame off of her so I wouldn't hurt her feelings even tho mine have been hurt the entire time. Then we spent an hour talking and she was trying to get to know me and ask questions 

I thought it was a good conversation but now I'm over all of it because of the most recent situation 

I now have to work with her for a few months. Maggie is now my manager, at first when I found out I had a panic attack. I cried so much I had so much fear that she would continue to mess up my relationship or ruin my chance for promotion. I didnt ask for a transfer I decided to stick through it. One month into working with her im over it. 

We had a managers meeting first one with us together, there were 5 people at the meeting. The ice breaker was tell 3 fun facts. So we went in a circle. She went first. And one of her fun facts, I have 6 cats with my husband. So I kinda went off of that and said oh I have 4 cats with my bf. She followed up and in front of everyone asked me who is my bf?
I answered because I'm on the spot and shes my manager. But it was weird. Honestly I dont think anyone else cared who my bf is. He's not a secret but that wasnt the purpose of the fun fact. she didnt ask anyone else about their significant other or annouce her husband. I believe it was just her asserting her dominance for some reason 

This comment bothered me so much. I vented to my bf and my therapist and my friend. And everyone agreed yea it was weird. And maybe I should've snapped back. Like WHOS YOUR HUSBAND. But also I shouldn't have to. 

I decided to confront her and told her how much it bothered me. And said id perfer not to talk about my relationship at work.  Her only response was okay 

With everything thats happened I've had so much anxiety. I fell in love with my boyfriend and truly want a life with him but have considered almost every month that we've been together if I can continue our relationship because of their friendship.  The solution he suggested is that i dont have to be friends with them. Which I considered as an option but now I hate it. I'm confused why he still wants to hang out with them even tho I've been so hurt and uncomfortable by them. And im just so angry, anxious and jealous of her. And when he hangs out with them without me I'm just spiraling. Yea more communication and trust could help. But I just dont trust her. And if she truly cared about her friend why wouldn't she show interest in his new girlfriend. Instead she's made me feel so bad for so many months and had to be confronted so now it feels focused. After the work comment I truly dont want to be around her. She seems tone deaf she seems obsessive and I think the anxiety would stop if the friendship stopped. Because if it doesnt then she still gets what she wants, closeness with my bf. I asked him also if we were to break up if he would still hang out with her one on one again
 He said yea probably. So now it feels like he doesn't understand all the things shes doing wrong or what shes doing could prevent him from having any successful relationship in my opinion. So in my head I'm like okay choose her then.

I finally decided that this might be the solution to move on, be friends with her or invest in our relationship. But we are going to couples counseling to maybe that could help too

1p2rish,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1p2rish/financial_dynamics/,Financial dynamics,"Hi! Please be kind, right now I’m feeling like a fool already.
So, since around four years I quit my office job to take care of my baby and got a less paying one, but way less demanding as well, which allows me to be really close to my kid and I love that part. However, lately I’ve been questioning the financial dynamics with my husband. He has always been the highest earning person and since before having our baby the arrangement was that he would be paying the apartment mortgage, travel expenses, medical expenses and cars, insurance,etc while I would took care of the monthly bills, maintenance fees for the apartment, house keeper wages, groceries, cleaning supplies, etc. This arrangement was fine with me until I started to earn less; I can cover all of that, but if something extra comes up, such as buying a birthday present, buying coffee once a week or  wanting to treat myself with something, I have to ask him to cover some part of the expenses; that’s generally fine with him-it’s never such a big difference- but sometimes he questions why I need more money, etc.
What bothers me, is that, while he questions my weekly l Starbucks lattes, he has full freedom to buy expensive clothes and articles since he gets to save and cover all the expenses assigned to him in the month, but god forbid I want a blouse because it’s like I almost have to ask permission. 
Another thing is that we own an apartment that we rent, I contributed to it, but he receives all the rent and manages it, I don’t see a penny of that- I know he invest the money and he is sensible, but it makes me angry to not have access and sort of act as if when I ask for money it’s like it’s his when it’s actually ours. To me, this is crossing a fine line into financial violence, but not sure how to act or what to do.
Also, I think I contribute to his productivity by taking care of our kid and taking care of things that otherwise would distract him from his job, actually they distract me from mine and I have to juggle my work responsibilities with my mom responsibilities and he doesn’t seem to notice that. 
I don’t know if I need advice or some empathy, but I would really like to read a third party point of view.",1,1763706859.0,breakingmom,6,1.0,False

2nd guy - The ever so egotistical and Antagonistic Devil. Jackson
(Small lore drop if interested)
Jackson was normally supposed to only represent the Devil and was the main Antagonist in Ryōkahn's original story, but then I figured I could do a lot more with Jackson than with Ryō, I built a story with him from the ground up that was made by some of the greatest people I had met on this server (who sadly aren't active anymore) And once that story was sealed I created my own which you can find on my original account with many of my other greatest creations (I'll leave that in the comments)
But to this day I consider Jackson to be one of my greatest creations. Some of him is based off me but for the most part he's a sadistic bastard with a hatred for humanity and a overwhelming love of Coffee

3rd guy - Jackson?, this guy is simply Jackson if he decided to go down a more righteous path to live, Less powerful in turn for better actions and kindness. He exists to show Jackson that if he just listens. He can be a good person

My teeth are pretty beat up from acid reflux and grinding but have been basically the same for the last 9ish years. No cavities, no issues other than sensitivity that comes and goes depending on how hard I clench and grind each week. I have a very nice nightguard and the reflux has been dealt with for about a decade now.

During my last appointment my dental hygienist mentioned a spot on one tooth that didn’t look right. She said she wasn’t sure what it was but my dentist would look at it and if he was concerned he would say something. He didn’t bring it up and said everything looked great as usual and my X-rays were also fine. Dental health wise I’ve only had a single cavity/filling and it was over 15 years ago. I don’t drink, smoke, or drink coffee. I primarily drink water and sparkling water, 7up, root beer all diet and I rinse my mouth with water when I’m done. 

I took a picture today after remembering the appointment and it’s got me concerned. I don’t have insurance anymore and I still haven’t found work so I have no income. I’m not sure if I need to have this looked at again or if it’s nothing. I really don’t want to eat a large bill over nothing.

I’m show up for the people I care about and live intentionally. Every day I work out and live a life I'm proud of. In a relationship, I'm energetic—so think fun dates, calm nights in, playful teasing, and a lot of interest from me in the things you love.

Big Final Fantasy nerd here, so if you've played, we’ll have plenty to talk about. I’m working on a Cloud cosplay rn and would love to do couples cosplay someday if that’s your thing.

Most nights I’m drawing, reading, or writing fantasy. Over the next five years I’m working toward a Creative Writing MFA and getting a couple of novels published. With my partner I'd be happy doing coffee shop or bookstore dates, or long video calls full of laughter, anime, and co-op games (or just watching each other play).

My type? Cute face, feminine, slim or athletic, and fun to talk to. Kind, loyal, and passionate about something in her own life. I’m drawn to natural beauty—anything from Yuna’s softer look to Tifa’s more refined feminine energy.

Non-negotiables: loyalty and real communication. Someone who stays when it gets hard.

(This isn't even about the og post title anymore lmao),"Here is my last [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/WouldIBeTheAhole/comments/1or4krt/2nd_update_wibtah_if_i_let_my_mom_move_in_with_me/)

If you're not up to date, just check my posts at this point lmao

Okay helloooo everyone, sorry it’s been so long since I last updated, my computer was trapped in apple store jail for the past week and ultimately, it couldn't be repaired due to severe unexplained water damage. Luckily my friend/ex (lol) was able to give me an old laptop so I have returned rather unceremoniously!! I haven’t formally said this in a post yet, but yes, I’m in NYC, as many have suspected. Here are my updates:

There was a huge confrontation with Anna and my landlord last week, involving lots of screaming on both sides, as well as her yelling insults at my mother. Of course she claims he put his hands on her. I have proof he did not do as such, as well as his word that he did not do as she claims he did. All he did was confront her at the front door of the building in regards to the Notice to Vacate as well as the rent money she owes Dan, she ran from him saying she would not speak to him, he followed her up the stairs to our front apt door, and, since I had (earlier in the day) given him my express permission to enter, attempted to enter the apartment by pushing the door open, which she blocked repeatedly. There was a whole confrontation involving Anna, her friends who were all there at the time, the landlord, and my mom and I that did not end well. She attempted to manipulate me into taking her side, saying “I told you this is how this would go, don’t you see that your mother is an evil demon??? You know this is wrong, I know you do, I actually liked you and trusted you…” I simply said “I cannot talk about this right now, I cannot deal with this shit” and went in my room. I have this whole interaction recorded.

Dan, My mother, and I all had a meeting with the landlord the next day at his office, where he informed us that he was taking legal action that did not involve locking her out as I thought he was going to do, so we’re going to have to go the housing court route which could take up to a year. I played the recordings I have for my landlord and he just laughed at the absurdity of it all, then turned it all back on me, asking “well if it’s so bad, why haven’t you just left already??” I do not have the money to do so, that’s why.

The tormenting has not stopped since I last updated, in fact it has only gotten worse. Anna has now resorted to petty means to torment me, including purposely (I assume) clogging toilets and blaming it on me, though it happened while I, Dan, and my mother were not even home lol, we received an angry text about how she “doesn’t plan on unclogging that. As a heads up.” I had to unclog both toilets when I returned home, and it still wasn’t good enough, she insulted my mother and I for “leaking shit in the toilets” which we did not do, and claimed we didn’t know how to flush a toilet and were unclean, “too grown for this shit, I shouldn’t have to remind you”…. When I went to unclog the bullshit, there were wads of TP coming up, not something a normal person would use when using a toilet THAT HAS A BIDET BTW.

As well as she took all of my mugs and most of my plates from the kitchen cabinets, which is in retaliation to when I took my own coffee maker, knives, and blender out of the kitchen at my therapist’s advice, as she is dangerous and not to be trusted with sharp objects, as well as I don’t want her to have the privilege of using my things I paid for if she is going to continue to treat me and she does. When (if) I move out she is going to lose varying in that goddamn kitchen, as I am the one who purchased everything that is in it, except for Anna’s pot and Dan’s air fryer. 

I filed a police report against Anna for harassment, but that hasn’t done much in regards to getting her out of the apartment, my landlord does not give a singular shit, it seems. Bathroom ceiling was pouring water all over the floor for the idk… 5th time this year? And he still won’t fix it. I don’t have heat in my room and it’s 35 degrees outside and windy as fuck… it’s all bullshit. 

I’ve decided I’m going to move out, though I have no idea how to. I’m considering making a gofundme to help with moving costs to get out of this bonkers situation, which are going to be upwards of 5k, (moving van, storage unit, broker fees, deposit on new apt, etc) but idk, that seems kind of… embarrassing? To me? I have a lot of pride, unfortunately, and it’s getting in the way.

My therapist gave me a resource for getting help with housing issues, but they couldn’t help me. I’m looking at apartments but I don’t have consistent income (gig work lol, if you work in film, or just the arts in general you know how it is lol) so I have NO IDEA how I’m going to be able to qualify for a place with my ass cheeks credit score (which is not great bc I’ve only ever had one credit card in my whole life) let alone afford to move, hence why I haven’t just left yet. Getting anything even remotely figured out and set up is proving to be difficult because MY FUCKING LAPTOP DECIDED TO BREAK??? So that little bitch is at the Apple Store in time out for the next 5 days. (as of posting, laptop is out of jail and not fixable)

Also I must have dropped my wallet when I was taking one of my walks where I angrily kick leaves around to blow off steam because TODAY I noticed someone used my debit card to get McDonalds. I do not eat McDonalds. So now, on top of the asinine Anna situation, I’m in a whole separate bag of shit having to replace everything in my wallet, which included my social security card and birth certificate and full OMNY card, because yes I am an idiot. (Before anyone says anything, yes, I’ve already locked all my cards and my credit.) Honestly, I'm more sad about losing my favorite wallet than all the things that were in it. Goodbye tan Prada wallet I found in a thrift store for $20, my sweet prince.

Also I stepped in dog shit the other day so that’s fucking great. It’s buried in the treads of my sneakers and idk how to get the smell out.

I’m thinking Anna may actually be a witch and did in fact put a curse on me because what the hell… When it rains it pours? Bitch this is a goddamn monsoon. The years start coming and they don’t stop coming, fed to the rules and I hit the ground running… or whatever smash mouth said… I know some of you had recommended I turn to Santeria rituals, but that just doesn't feel safe/right to me considering that's a practice i've never had any involvement in, as well as it has a deep history I'm not versed in. Also re: salt circles/lines, my cat would totally disturb them, so that's a no-go.

Long story fuckin short, shit has been ass but this is my life so basically “fork found in kitchen.” Shoutout to my ex who I am still friends with bc we’re cool like that for letting me have this laptop, fuck unexplained laptop water damage, idek anymore, should I start a gofundme so I can get my mom and I out of this hellhole? Would any of you guys be down to help? I’m genuinely at a loss here lmao. In need of advice or fucking something because I have to get my ass out of here, the formal eviction process will take up to a year, and my landlord has yet to even attempt to serve her his formal eviction with his attorney. I just need to find a way to cut my losses and get out before I end up in the cuckoo's nest.",1,1763706075.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,8,0.67,False
