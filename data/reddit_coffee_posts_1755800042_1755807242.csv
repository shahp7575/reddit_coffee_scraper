But I'm not sure how to fast as it was intended. I've been trying to learn, because I know some demons can only be taken out by praying and fasting, but I'm not sure how it's done. 

How long should I go without eating? Can I drink coffee? Can I drink water? Can I chew gum? What should I pray for and how?

1mwls9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/weightgain/comments/1mwls9q/struggling_to_eat_because_of_health_anxiety/,Struggling to eat because of health anxiety,"My health anxiety is the worst it's ever been and now I'm basically not eating anything apart from a bowl of porridge or cereal in the morning. I've been having severe stabbing pains in my chest and back for the past 2 weeks, which I'm still undergoing tests for and doctors can't give me an answer for why I'm in so much pain. If I knew what it was, I could just tailor my diet around that. 

If my pain is heart related, I don't want to eat fat or cholesterol. If it's gallstones, I can't eat fat either. If it's something like GERD, gastritis, oesophagitis or Barretts's oesophagus, then there's a whole lot more food that I can't eat. I can't even eat chocolate or coffee anymore 😭. I've also convinced myself that I have gastroparesis, there's actually a chance I might have that because of my previous eating disorder. If I have that, then I basically can't even eat fruits, vegetables or anything with fibre in. I also hate the sensation of being full and worry that food might not digest and will form a bezoar in the bottom of my stomach.  

So there's basically nothing I can eat until doctors find out what is causing me chest and back pain, which could take months. Also I'm worried that my lack of appetite could be caused by cancer. Please help, I can't keep losing weight like this and I don't know what to do 😭. 

Also I am under a mental health team (NHS UK) and they're not helping me. They are aware of my problems and my weight. I can't really afford private treatment. I want and need to gain weight but I really have no appetite. ",1,1755806988.0,weightgain,0,1.0,False

1mwlqjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1mwlqjr/meta_is_anxious_about_meeting_me_for_the_first/,Meta is anxious about meeting me for the first time,"And I am trying to think what I should do in order to make sure our meeting will go well. 

My meta (38F) and I (40F) will meet each other for the first time soon. Meta has been with our mutual partner (41M) for a few years, and then he moved to my city. Meta and hinge have been long distance for a few years since. Next week she is coming to visit him and staying for a bit (2 weeks) at his place. 

My relationship with the mutual partner is newer (a few months). The hinge has been doing an amazing job. From what I hear from him about my meta, she seems a cool person, and she has been supportive of our (my and hinge’s) relationship. 

Now I’m actually quite excited about meeting her. However, I hear from the hinge that she is “surprisingly a little anxious” about meeting me. 

I wonder what I can do to ease her anxiety. I’ve searched and read similar posts in this sub but still wonder if you guys have more ideas.

So far I’ve suggested that my meta and I meet one on one without the hinge for coffee. My meta loves coffee so I’ve looked up a nice fun cafe where they have a wide range of coffee beans to try. I think I’ll also suggest we meet on Saturday about 2 hours before I go to the gym as usual so there is a clear end time. I will come to the meeting with the mindset that I am just meeting a friend of a friend. Does it sound like a safe plan? 

I understand that to her I might appear as the new shiny love of her partner so that’s why she is a little anxious. I will not have any date with our hinge in the 2 weeks that my meta is here. It’s my own initiative so that they can have the time and space to themselves (and my partner agrees). 

What else should I think of? Of course I’m a little anxious myself. After all, they have been together for a long time and their relationship seems very solid. They have been through a lot together. However, I’m also in an easier position probably because a) I’m new, b) I’m the local partner. 

I should also mention that I think this is actually her first real poly relationship (her previous relationships were more open than poly if I’m not mistaken.) ",1,1755806880.0,polyamory,2,1.0,False
1mwln4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1mwln4z/im_done_with_my_mom/,im done with my mom,"Hi, this is a throwaway account- some of my family knows my main account and i dont want anyone linking this to me. 

My (20F) relationship with my mom (43F) was destroyed after my father passed away around 10 gears ago, after he passed she became more aggressive, she even changed religiously and stopped practicing our religion, she started surrounding herself with her friends and completely forgetting about me and my siblings. I have 3 younger siblings, the youngest two i practically raised by myself since all she hsed to do is go out with her friends and come back late. 

I get that mothers should bave time away from home to reconnect with themselves and recharge but she was barely home to start with, she also started traveling and leaving me to take care of ny siblings, and juggling this with college was horrible— even with highschool it was horrible. 

Anyways- to get to my point, this summer we planned to travel as a family all 5 of us, it was for 3 weeks. And i hated it. The whole trip the only thing she would do is get mad at me and make me do everything for her. These are some of the instances that lead me to say thst im done with my mom.

We were at a mall shopping and we have a designated driver with us for that day, and she is the only one that has the drivers number to let him know that we are done and he should come to the pickup area, i told her 10 minutes before we headed to the exit to call the driver, and i realized she didnt once we got near to the exit and she was just texting her friend so i once again told her “can you call the driver? it will take him time to come to the pickup” she gave me this look like i offended her and she said “who are you to give me orders-? Who do you think you are” and proceeded to throw on me her muffin wrapper that she was just done eating. i hated that. Why would she throw garbage on me, in front of people too, in public, people could see us, she was degrading me as a human i felt disgusting that people saw me like that. 

Look there are a lot of things that happened but im just going to talk about the two that really made me hate her this summer. 

So we were at the downtown of this city and when we arrived i saw that there was this nice information board with what we could do so I looked at her and i said “wait please i want to take a look” and my siblings waited with me but she walked away even though i told her to wait, it took me a minute to read the board but by the time i was done she was gone and i was looking everywhere for her and my brother said he felt thirsty and needs some water so i entered a random coffee shop to buy for him some water and then i continued looking— when i finally saw her i walked up to her snd i could see the fury in her eyes, she looked at me and she said “do you want me to slap you?— do you? How dare you walk away from me and leave me alone” and i looked at her and i swore to her that she couldn’t slap me (in our religion if you swear to god on someone to not do a certain action or say something— they cannot - its hard to explain) so she didnt slap me but she hit me so hard across my arms and shoulder and again- in front of people and i felt so humiliated 

Just to let u know a few hours after that she came up to me and said “you never say you love me anymore- you never hug me” wow. 

I hate how she thinks she does nothing wrong and shes the one whos always right

I want to leave home i want to leave her i want to go no contact and i want to forget her and i wish her the worst

Im sorry if there is mistakes in my writing im typing this on my phone and english is not my first language + the dialogue was a little different as i had to translate it

May 8, 2023, my Alpha Mate, Ethan Hawthorne brought his mistress to our pack, and I decided to deceive him into divoring me.

# Read Link: [https://writers.sugarspicecorner.com/alpha-1/](https://writers.sugarspicecorner.com/alpha-1/)

Standing in front of his office, I took a deep breath, knocked on and stepped inside.

The polished wood door swung closed behind me with a soft click.

I clutched the file in my hands, forcing a mechanical smile to my lips as I approached his desk. Ethan didn’t glance up. His focus remained on the laptop screen.

“Are you busy?” I asked, my voice even, polite.

He looked up, his gray eyes meeting mine without any flicker of warmth.

“A bit,” he said, voice low and rough. He leaned back in his chair. I placed the folder on his desk, already flipping to the marked pages where his signature was needed.

“Just a few spots to sign.”

Without reading, he picked up the pen lying next to his laptop and began to sign, page after page, his hand moving automatically, his gaze occasionally drifting back to his screen.

I watched silently. Ethan looked… worn out. His usually sharp grey eyes were dull, and there were deep shadows un- der them. He had just come back from London after two weeks at the Annual Alpha Conference – a gathering of pack leaders across the globe.

But he hadn’t come back alone.

My wolf Yve stirred uneasily inside me. ‘He reeks of her.’ I pushed her down gently. There was no point in flaring up.Not when the papers he had just signed held the ending we both needed.

When he was finished, he clicked the pen closed and slid it across the table toward me.

“Thanks,” I said, sliding the documents back into my folder.

I paused, hesitated, then asked, “Will you be home for dinner tonight?”

Predictably, Ethan shook his head. “Got some things to wrap up here. Don’t wait.”

I nodded, plastering the same empty smile across my face. “Got it. See you around, Alpha,” I said, forcing my voice to sound like any other obedient wolf under his rule-not like the Luna and fated mate he seemed to have regretted

claiming.”

I turned away, letting my smile fade once my back was to him.

My heels clicked softly against the hardwood floor as I walked toward the door. The air shifted slightly when I passed the annex lounge, and Yve immediately bristled.

‘Smell.’Sweet vanilla perfume – too sweet.I glanced sideways without thinking, my enhanced senses sharpening the image beyond what human eyes would see.

Half a box of artisanal pastries sat abandoned on the low glass table. A lipstick-smeared coffee cup beside it. And near the plush lounge chair, a black high-heeled shoe.

Yve snarled deep within me, the sound more a vibration across my bones than a true noise. He brought her here. Here. Not just to London. To our den. Our Pack. He stains our space.’

My throat tightened painfully.

My chest felt heavy, like something was sitting right on top of it as I turned on my heel and head back, away from this awful place that made me feel disgusted.

By the time I got back to my office, exhaustion hit me hard. I dropped into my chair, not even bothering to turn on the lights.

Slowly, I pulled out the divorce agreement from the lowest drawer-the very document Ethan had just unknowingly signed.

My fingers brushed over his perfect signature.

Firm. Bold. Unwavering.

Just like the way he had pledged himself to me during the mating ceremony years ago. Back then, Ethan had been so firm, so sure. He looked at me like I was his whole world. I had believed it, like a fool.

That familiar scent I sniffed earlier-I knew exactly who it belonged to. I’m smarter than this. I should’ve seen it coming.

I could still feel the phantom brush of his lips against the mark he placed on my neck.

I leaned back in my chair, staring blankly at the ceiling. I could almost hear Ethan’s mother Amelia’s voice again- calm, cold, and cutting. “Don’t be naive, Olivia. Men—even Alphas-always want more. They don’t stay faithful.”

A bitter laugh escaped my lips. “You were always spot on, Amelia,” I muttered.

I realized then that I had been wrong. So, so wrong.

Not only had Ethan cheated, but he had taken his mistress to our office.

‘We deserve better’, Yve whispered.

‘We do’, I agreed.



Steeling myself, I picked up my phone, snapped a clear photo of the signed divorce agreement, and attached it to a

new message.

To: Amelia HawthroneSubject: Agreement CompleteMessage: Ethan has signed, as per our understanding.

I hit send without hesitation.

The previous week, Amelia had approached me in private. If I agreed to file for divorce quietly, without confronting Ethan or exposing the affair publicly, she would ensure a settlement of $150 million transferred discreetly to my per- sonal accounts.

In the world of packs and politics, image was everything. An Alpha embroiled in a public scandal would weaken the Hawthrone Pack’s standing – something Amelia would never allow.

Neither would I, truthfully. No matter how broken Ethan had left me, I would not humiliate myself by causing a spec-

tacle.

I had my dignity.

After a month – the grace period to finalize everything – Ethan would be free. And so would I.

I let out a slow breath, settling into my chair. That’s when a knock came at the door.

“Come in,” I said.

Ethan’s beta, Reed stepped inside, carrying a small, elegant box in both hands.

17

“Luna Olivia,” he said formally, not quite meeting my eyes. “Alpha Ethan asked me to deliver this to you. He bought it for you during his trip to London.”

Reed placed the box on my desk and I flipped the lid open.

Inside, nestled on deep blue velvet, was a gleaming diamond set – necklace, earrings, bracelet. The same set I had seen in a photo…on her.

Disgust crawled up my throat.

“Alpha Ethan mentioned he… he picked it out personally. Wanted something special for you.” Reed added quickly, like the words might make it hurt less.

I forced a smile, tucking the box back into my desk drawer like it meant nothing.

“How thoughtful of him,” I said. “Even with his busy schedule and all” I said lightly, my tone dripping with sarcasm.

Reed flinched slightly. “I should get back,” He was slipping out, leaving the door swinging shut behind him with a

soft thud.

My eyes dropped back to the jewelry sitting on my desk, gleaming under the harsh office lights. My stomach twisted in disgust.

Without wasting another second, I snapped a photo of it and forwarded it to a second-hand luxury dealer.Me: Donate



the full amount to the werewolf orphanage fund.

I shut the box with a click, wiping my hands like I’d just handled garbage. Because, honestly, that’s what it felt like.

By five in the evening. I was wrapping up, gathering my things, and heading to the parking lot. The day had drained me, but it was the kind of exhaustion that sat deeper than muscles or bones.

As I stepped outside, the wind shifted, carrying a familiar scent Leather. Musk. Vanilla.

My eyes narrowed instinctively.

That’s when I spotted Ethan’s car, parked near the exit.

Through the window, I caught a glimpse-Ethan, sitting in the back seat.

And right beside him, a vibrant blonde, laughing like she didn’t have a care in the world.

Reed was behind the wheel.

The second he saw me, he slammed on the brakes, hard enough that the car jolted.

For a heartbeat, everything went still.

My eyes locked with Ethan’s through the glass.

My partner and I have decent-paying jobs for our age (household income of £60k a year) however when I look at our budget for the next month I always end up upset because we are scrimping out on groceries, have 0 social life & no money to treat ourselves to even a little bit of self care. We are just about able to make it to the end of the month. 

Our rent is a lot and we do live in a nice house, in saying that, the rent is very average for most houses in NI at the minute, anything less and we’d be in a crack house. We are also battling our way out of debts (not that much may I add) and we have a baby on the way. So that’s the part that makes me think I am delusional and it’s just a difficult time. 

However, it feels like everyone around me in similar situations are perfectly happy and fine. They are off on holidays and buying flashy cars with their roots done and nails did… and I am here with greasy hair, because I chose toothpaste over shampoo when I went to the shop this evening in my 2018 shein fit (very ball-y and washed out, I should add). My social life is next to none as I can’t afford to pay for a coffee let alone a dinner or night out, to be honest, I’d end up upset listening to my friends talk about the amazing life they are living despite working part time or not at all. 

I used to be so glam and look after myself so well as a teenager, I was so confident then and of course had lots of money as I worked hard, lived at home and didn’t eat, now I am in my early 20s and scared to bump into anyone, as I seem to be the only one who looks and is doing as awful as I do right now. I’m terrified that I am going to loose myself further due to having a baby, which of course every spare penny will be going to him. In an ideal world we could both have a good life, and I am sad that I am welcoming him into a world where I can’t promise him luxury. 

Does this get easier? Can anyone in their 30s tell me that I’ve only got a few years left of misery? Or is it just the way of the world now and I’d be better off on UC, not even trying to climb the career ladder? Does the resentment for people receiving mummy and daddy’s money ever go away?

I used to have nightmares when I was a kid. Not the kind that fade when you sit up and remember where you are. Mine arrived the same way every time, like a ritual I couldn’t stop.

The floorboards would  
creak once, as if someone had placed a foot beside my bed. Then I would hear a  
slow dripping, steady and patient, as if water were leaking from a tap inside  
the dark. I would hold my breath and count the drips and hope they would stop.  
They never did.

He came after the  
dripping.

The Grey Man.

He would just materialise  
out of nowhere, standing beside my bed, phasing in like something from a sci-fi  
movie. If he stood up, I knew he would be taller than the door frame. His skin  
was the colour of ash and where his eyes should have been there were two empty  
pits. His mouth was a thin line that would sometimes open into a wide smile  
showing rows of too many teeth. He would tilt his head as if I were an item he  
was deciding whether to buy.

He never climbed onto the  
bed, like you hear in some sleep paralysis dreams. He would crouch low next to  
me, bring his face close to mine and breathe in, as if smelling me the way you  
smell a book you loved as a child. Then his long hand would slide down, and  
with a gentleness that made it worse, he would take my ankle and pull me under.

Under the bed there was  
no carpet and no wood. There was a place that didn’t belong in a house at all.  
The air was hot and thick. It tasted like coins left in your mouth too long.  
Heat rolled up from the ground and made my eyes water. He would drag me along  
the rough dirt, pebbled with little shards and seeds that cut my back and arms.  
When I reached out to try and grab the walls, they were damp in a way that  
stung. Coated with an acidic gloop that you could never wipe clean. The place  
smelled like old blood, and the sweet rot you notice when you walk past a bin  
on a hot day.

There were insects  
everywhere. I could not see all of them, but I could hear them. A dry clicking  
sound from little legs. A soft buzzing from wings. The cautious rasp of  
mouthparts trying a new surface to see if it could be eaten.

Behind us there was  
nothing that looked like a way back. There were tall shapes made of the same  
hot dirt, shaped like pillars, shaped like bodies that had forgotten how to be  
people. He would pick me up and place me on a chair like I was a prized possession.  
Then he would take a thin knife from the fold of his skin, and he would begin.

He never rushed. He never  
made a sound. He would slice pieces from my arms and lay them on the ground as  
if sorting fabric. He would rest his palm on my chest to feel my heart speed up  
and slow down. He would take a strip from my cheek and watch the tear run  
around it. I begged him the way children beg and promise to be better. He  
tilted his head as if memorising the noise, but he would never stop. He never  
showed emotion, no joy, no anger.

In those dreams I  
remained alive when I shouldn’t have. There were times when the only part of me  
left was my head. I could feel the dirt under my tongue. I could feel insects  
trying the corners of my mouth and changing their minds. I could smell the heat.  
I could see him as he bent close and, for a moment, set his forehead to mine.

Then I would wake up with  
my jaw cramped and my throat raw from air I must have swallowed while I  
screamed without sound.

My parents did what they  
could. They never used words like cursed or haunted. They used words like  
specialist and appointment and therapy. I drew the Grey Man for a woman with a  
calm voice who didn’t look at my drawings when I handed them over but always  
took a moment before she turned the paper. I learned breathing exercises. I  
learned to plant my feet on the ground and list five things I could see.

The dreams didn’t stop at  
once, but they frayed at the edges. They came less often. I grew taller. I  
learned to put my hand on the bedroom light switch before I went to sleep. When  
I left for college, they did not follow me.

I told people I was a  
nervous kid who grew out of it. That was mostly true.

I am an adult now. I pay  
my bills on time. I have a decent job and a flat that is more tidy than messy.  
I do not scare easily. There is nothing in my life that looks like a horror  
story if you glance at it from the outside.

Last week I went to a  
funfair with Beth. She is the sort of friend who can talk you into trying food  
you do not recognise and rides you claim to hate. We wandered through the  
lights and the noise and the smell of hot oil.

There was a fortune  
teller’s tent set up near the far fence. It looked like it had been pitched in  
a hurry. The canvas did not match. The guy ropes were assorted colours. It was  
dark inside and too quiet, as if sound did not want to sit in there.

Beth wanted to go in. I  
didn’t, not because I was scared, more that I didn’t believe in this type of  
shite. But she said please, and it was the only thing there without a line and  
I was thinking about doughnuts.

The woman inside looked  
like she’d stepped straight out of a cliché. Shawls, bangles, long grey hair.  
But what caught me wasn’t her. It was the bird.

A white bird, perched on  
her shoulder.

Beth smiled nervously.  
“Aww, a dove.”

The woman didn’t look up  
from her cards. “Not a dove,” she said. Her voice melodic. “A crow.”

I squinted. “It’s white.”

That was when she finally  
met my eyes. Her smile didn’t reach them.

“Not everything white is  
innocent.”

Beth shivered, muttered  
something about it being pretty, then sat down.

She went first.

The woman inside took her  
hands and asked about her true desire.

The woman read her cards,  
asked her about her one true desire. Beth blushed and said something stupid  
about wanting a nice boyfriend.

I laughed and muttered,  
“Jesus, at least make it achievable. Give the old bag a chance to fake it.”

Both of them turned to  
look at me the way teachers look at you when you talk during lessons.

Beth’s turn ended with  
the rustle of a curtain of beads and the tiny chime of something metal. The  
woman lifted her eyes to me and asked me to sit.

I didn’t want to, but  
Beth gave me that look.

The chair was lower than  
I expected. It made me feel like a child.

The woman’s hands were cool,  
and her thumbs were rough where they pressed against my palms.

I made another joke about  
props and smoke machines, and she did not smile.

“Do not insult what  
listens,” she said. “Some things are bored enough to answer.”

I raised an eyebrow. She  
looked past me and then at me, like a doctor waiting for you to say where it  
hurts.

“I feel your resistance,”  
she said kindly.

“Because this isn’t  
real!” I snapped back. “It’s a joke. A tent in a mud pit funfair with plastic  
beads on the curtains. You’re not communing with the universe; you’re just  
scamming bored people out of pocket change.”

Her expression didn’t  
shift. She simply tilted her head, birdlike.

The white crow ruffled  
its feathers, as though it had heard me.

“Even a joke,” she said,  
“is heard somewhere.”

“Great,” I muttered.  
“Tell the cosmos I said hi, then.”

Her lips twitched into  
something that wasn’t quite a smile.

The crow shifted its  
claws against her shoulder, white feathers catching the lantern glow like bone.

“You’ll laugh until it  
answers,” she murmured.

Beth shot me a look, the  
kind that said *don’t start*.

I leaned back in the  
chair, folding my arms. “Fine. Go on, tell me my fortune. Make it quick.”

The woman’s gaze didn’t  
waver. “When you mock the door,” she said softly, “you invite whatever waits  
behind it to knock.”

That was when she asked  
me my one true desire.

I chilled for a minute. I  
didn’t want to give the old woman a heart attack.

I told her my life was  
fine. I told her I had enough money and enough work and enough friends for the  
kind of person I am.

Then I said the only  
thing that had ever been an honest wish for me.

I said I wanted no more  
bad dreams.

Her eyes went soft and  
far away. She let go of my hands and traced circles on the tablecloth with one  
finger.

Then she said a rhyme. I  
remember it almost exactly:

Grant this woman the power  
*to see*  
*What’s good and right and true.*  
*But where the light of goodness shines,*  
*The dark will see her too.*

I felt goosebumps on my  
arms. I covered it by rolling my eyes.

I said something unkind  
about how she must do well on people desperate enough to be happy with a poem.

She looked at me for a  
long time without blinking.

“Do not anger what you  
cannot see,” she said. “It is patient. It can wait until you forget you spoke.”

We left, and I made a  
show of being hungry and moved the conversation to food.

That night I dreamed I found  
a fifty-pound note folded into the lining of my coat. In the dream it felt  
stiff and new, with the smell of ink and the slight waxy drag against my  
fingers.

I didn’t think anything  
of it and pretty much forgot the dream as soon as I woke.

But that day, it was  
unusually cold for May. Bitterly cold.

I fished in my closet for  
my winter jacket and slipped it on. Halfway to work I slipped my hands in the  
pockets for warmth and my fingers grazed something hard.

I pulled it out.

It was a red envelope  
with my name on the front, still sealed.

I opened it cautiously  
and lifted the sparkly Christmas card from the paper.

On one side it read:

Merry Christmas, lots of  
*love, Grandma xxx*

And on the other, a  
neatly folded £50 note was stuck to the side with tape.

I must admit, I was a bit  
like “no way” at first. But then I thought, people forget to open Christmas  
cards all the time, right? Just a coincidence, I told myself. I wasn’t  
impressed.

The next night I dreamed  
that the woman at work who collects complaints like stamps would call in sick.

She did.

I told myself that one  
was almost predictable. She had coughed the day before.

On the third night I  
dreamed that I was eating the most delicious bowl of strawberries and cream I  
had ever eaten.

In the morning there were  
strawberries in the fridge, now I don’t buy strawberries as a rule. I’ll eat them at restaurants, but I won’t have them in my fridge.

You buy them on a Monday  
and by Tuesday night they have grown their own mould colony and have elected a  
mayor.

I checked my banking app  
to see if I had bought them half-asleep the night before. No charge.

I told myself I must have  
paid cash and forgotten.

I ate one and it tasted  
like a memory of summer. So sweet and fresh.

On the fifth night I  
dreamed of Beth. I dreamed she won a ridiculous prize at a ring toss.

In the morning, she sent  
me a photo of herself with a teddy as big as she is and a message that said *I am finally a winner* and a row of hearts.

I asked which fair. She  
said not the same one, she had gone with a “new guy friend.”

On the sixth night I  
dreamed of rain.

It poured in the dream,  
and everyone on the street ran.

I dreamed I stepped under  
a doorway that didn’t leak, and the person beside me stepped aside so I could  
fit.

When I woke up and went  
to work the sky broke while I was walking. The doorway I chose did not leak. A  
stranger moved over with a smile.

He handed me a napkin. He  
said I looked like I needed a win today.

I stopped telling myself  
it was nothing. I still tried to pretend, but it wasn’t a true pretending.

On the eighth night I had  
a different kind of dream.

I was in my room in the  
dark.

I couldn’t move.

The floorboard by the  
door creaked.

The sound wasn’t loud,  
but it was near the kind of volume that fills a whole house if it’s quiet.

Then there was the  
dripping again. It came from everywhere at once, as if every surface had been  
given one drop and told not to waste it.

I woke up with my heart  
climbing the wall of my chest.

I did not sit up. I lay  
still and I listened.

The house is old and does  
what old houses do. Pipes expand. Nails settle. Wood flexes.

The difference was that I  
knew the rhythm of this house.

This creak was not the  
same.

I could point to where it  
came from in the dark. It was the board by the door.

The rain was still  
pouring outside. I could see droplets dripping steadily from the window frame,  
but this wasn’t the same.

It was slow enough to  
make me count it and then lose count.

I could smell a dampness  
that didn’t belong to a leak.

I didn’t go to work that  
day.

I sat on the sofa in a  
daze, hands shaking as I sipped the same cup of cold coffee I’d held for four  
hours.

I didn’t understand what  
was happening.

I was so focused on the  
good things I was getting, I forgot I could have bad dreams too.

I stayed up as late as I  
could, refusing to go into the bedroom. But by 1 a.m. I couldn’t stay awake.

I dreamed I was back  
under the bed.

The air was hot, and the  
smell of iron sat on my tongue.

I was strapped to the  
same chair from my childhood.

He was there. The grey  
man.

Standing in front of me,  
that emotionless stare piercing my soul.

He took a step forward.

I thrashed and pulled at  
the restraints, desperate to get free.

He stopped, tilted his  
head, and placed a white envelope on my lap.

I woke up panting, hair  
stuck to my sweat-covered forehead.

My wrists ached and by  
the morning, small bruises had formed like faint ligature marks.

I came down the stairs to  
a small white envelope posted through my door with no stamp.

Inside it was a note that  
said:

*Keep sleeping well.*

The font was cheerful.  
The ink smelled faintly of almond oil.

I stood very still  
holding it and listening for the drip.

Last night I didn’t want  
to sleep.

I made tea. I watched  
shows that don’t require attention. I texted until my phone felt hot in my  
hands.

At 3 in the morning, I  
was tired enough to promise myself that fear is fuel and sleep isn’t the enemy.

I lay down.

I told myself that I had  
invented patterns because the fortune teller had given me a poem.

I reminded myself that I  
am not twelve years old.

I didn’t dream.

I woke just before 5  
a.m., exhausted. I lay in the dark willing myself to go back to sleep just a  
little longer.

I squeezed my eyes shut  
and that’s when I heard it—

The floorboard by the  
door gave its single careful creak.

I kept my eyes closed.

I told myself that if I  
could not see, nothing could see me.

Then the dripping began.

It was closer than it had  
ever been.

I opened my eyes and,  
barely moving, I tried to look at the slot of dark under the bed.

The smell of heat and  
metal pushed up over the edge like breath.

I reached one hand out  
and placed it flat on the floor only to prove that I could.

The wood was cold.

And then something in the  
dark below touched the other side of the board as if answering the gesture.

The board lifted against  
my palm with the weight of a measured hand.

I pulled my hand back and  
sat up.

I clicked on the lamp.

The room was the same as  
it had been.

The tall bookcase. The  
plant that did a trick for me last week. The frail curtains. The bed.

I told myself not to be  
dramatic.

The fortune teller had  
told nothing more than a fairy tale.

She could have said it to  
anyone.

And of course it would  
work sometimes. The world is full of coincidences.

I clicked the light off  
and tried to remember the therapist’s advice from so long ago.

My eyes grew heavy.

Five things I can see.  
Lamp.  
Door.  
Bed.  
Blankets.  
Book.

Four things I could touch.  
My blanket.  
My hair.  
My t-shirt.  
My nightstand.

Three I could hear.  
My heartbeat.  
My breathing.  
Dripping…

Two I could smell.  
Iron…  
Rot.

One I could taste.  
Old… coins.

“No,” I whispered.

My eyes snapped open.

The dripping sound was  
louder now.

Like something wet was  
seeping through the ceiling.

Except there was no  
stain. No leak.

And the smell—God, the  
smell—filled my throat until I was swallowing it.

It was the exact same as  
when I was a kid. Heat. Dirt. That metallic tang of rust and blood.

The floorboards creaked.

Not in the house. Not  
somewhere far away.

Right outside my door.

I held my breath, waiting  
for the sound to stop, but it didn’t.

Each groan of wood bent  
closer. Slow. Deliberate.

The therapist’s advice  
was gone.

The old woman’s words  
were all I could hear:

Do not insult what listens.  
*Some things are bored enough to answer.*

And I realised—

I had asked for no more  
bad dreams.

But maybe I’d given it  
permission to step into the waking world instead.

The door creaked open.

The Grey Man stood tall,  
grinning, his teeth reflecting in the moonlight.

He uttered one word:

*“Ready.”*

And then he vanished.

I think I screamed until  
morning.

I decided to go back to  
the fair.

I was going to find the  
tent, the old woman, and the dove-crow thing and tell her to undo what she did.

But… when I got there, it  
was gone.

The whole fair had packed  
up and moved on.

I managed to catch the  
owner of the teacup ride before he drove off and asked him where they were  
going next.

He made a comment about  
me being a carney chaser and I clapped back with something witty… honestly, I  
was too exhausted to remember.

Basically, I just wanted  
to find the fortune teller.

He frowned at me like I’d  
just asked him where the dragons were kept.

“The fair doesn’t have a  
fortune teller,” he said flatly.

I actually laughed, even  
though my throat felt like it was closing.

“Yeah, sure. Old woman.  
White bird. Creepy rhymes. You can’t miss her.”

He shook his head,  
climbed into the cab, and muttered something about weirdos before slamming the  
door.

The truck pulled away,  
leaving me in the half-empty lot with a stomach that felt like wet cement.

I stood there for way too  
long, hoping maybe the striped tent would flicker into view if I just stared  
hard enough.

It didn’t.

So now I’m stuck with  
this—whatever she gave me.

I can’t make sense of it.

I can’t make it stop.

And the part that really  
scares me?

Last night wasn’t a dream.

So, what will happen when  
the Grey Man takes me away \[again?\]([https://www.youtube.com/@midnightcreepypasta0](https://www.youtube.com/@midnightcreepypasta0))",1,1755806525.0,Midnightcreepypasta0,0,1.0,False

now your on tt doing the same thing. Even Netflix and all that is a monthly fee.
You pay it your good for a month they don’t ask everyday and ask us to pay them for every hour. So stop saying your like Netflix or anything like that.

# Order Notes

The culmination of the Village’s increasingly risky tactics is seen in *Once Upon a Time*. They approve Degree Absolute, a death sentence for Two if Six survives. The Village has reached the ultimate point of desperation, willing to sacrifice both Two and Six to achieve their goal. The stakes could not be higher: Six’s life is on the line, and so is the life of his captor. This is the culmination of a series of increasingly dangerous, costly techniques, revealing the full extent of the Village’s willingness to do whatever it takes to break him.

 

# SYNOPSIS

# Act One

Leo McKern’s Two is back in the Village. He arrives in his office looking exhausted. The Butler is there with breakfast, and his globular chair is occupied by a miniature Rover.

He tells the Butler to remove the breakfast. When the Butler doesn’t react, Two yells at him, “I told you to remove it!” This Two wasn’t a yeller last time, but something has clearly unraveled.

While the Butler gathers the breakfast, Two picks up the red phone and demands the removal of mini-Rover as well. After what it did to Curtis, I wouldn’t want it around either. More yelling: “I do it my way, or you find somebody else.” As the Butler clears away breakfast, Two instructs him, **“Leave the coffee.** ***The coffee, leave it!!!”*** Finally, the red phone relents; the globular chair descends into the floor, taking mini-Rover with it.

Two watches Six on the monitor. Six is pacing, eating toast and drinking tea in the same footage we saw in *Forsake*. “Why do you care?” Two asks the image.

He phones Six and asks him, “Why do you care?” Six recognizes the familiar voice. “I have been here before,” Two says, “Why do you care?” Six answers, “You’ll never know,” and hangs up.

Six goes for a walk and intimidates another Villager. The guy is very easily intimidated, but that doesn’t mean Six has to take advantage of the easy opportunity, does it?

Back in the Green Dome, Two reviews Six’s file and makes a decision. He picks up the red phone and declares, “Degree Absolute. I require approval. If you think he’s that important, there’s certainly no other alternative. You must risk either one of us!”

Two continues trying to persuade the red phone. “I am a good man — I *was* a good man — but if you get him he will be better, and there’s no other way.” Red phone gives him permission for one week of Degree Absolute.

In the Control Room, Two and the Supervisor oversee some kind of pulsator operation on Six, who is asleep in his cottage. Six appears agitated in his sleep but does not wake and is soothed by the Supervisor calmly repeating, “Five.” Two heads to Six’s cottage to continue the procedure.

# Act Two

In Six’s cottage, Two sings nursery rhymes to a sleeping Six. He’s no Nat King Cole, but Six somehow sleeps through the racket — and with the pulsator on his face at that. If nothing else works for your insomnia, I guess you might as well give this a try. In the morning, Two wakes Six to “go walkies,” delighting the toddler-like Six.

They walk together — toddler-P adorably licking an ice cream — until they reach the Embryo Room. The Butler is there, and Two tells P that they have one week. They walk over to a chalkboard, where Two attempts to explain the rules of the game.

Now P is playing with a rattle. Two, can you explain this so simply that a baby can understand it?

No, I didn’t think so. I won’t hold it against you. Can you explain it so simply that the TV audience can understand?

Still no. Let me take a crack at it.

Two’s goal is to figure out what’s going on in P’s “noddle” and use that understanding to win him over for Village leadership — at the cost of his own life, since only one can survive. Two dies if he succeeds, but he believes enough in the goal that he’s willing to sacrifice himself for it.

A second possible outcome is that P doesn’t survive the process. This would be a catastrophic outcome for the Village. The circumstances under which this might happen aren’t clear, but P’s life is somehow at risk.

A third possible outcome is that Two both fails and dies — sucks to be Two.

They begin roleplaying scenes from P’s life, with Two playing every authority figure. First, Two is P’s father. Then the two of them are playing on a seesaw. Then P is a schoolboy.

Schoolboy P is summoned to the principal’s office, where Two plays the part of the principal. Somebody was talking in class and P knows who, but P refuses to rat, angering the principal. The principal calls it cowardice, but P calls it honor.

The principal tells P, “Society is a place where people exist together. That is civilisation. The lone wolf belongs to the wilderness. You must not grow up to be a lone wolf! You must conform. It is my sworn duty to see that you do conform.” The principal sentences P to caning for his noncooperation. P defiantly asks for the caning to be doubled “so that I can remember.”

It is graduation day. Two, still playing the principal, introduces their prize pupil, P. The principal tells P how proud they are: “Proud that you have learnt to manage your rebellious spirit. Proud that your obedience is absolute. Why did you resign?” P is confused by the question.

Two repeats the question several times, yelling at P, until P yells back and decks him. P attacks Two until he is subdued by a club to the head from the Butler. Two and the Butler place P on a table. While they examine him, Two declares, “I’m beginning to like him.”

# Act Three

P is riding a rocking horse. Two tries to get him to say “Six,” but each time he replies “Five.” This is a thing they’ll do throughout the episode — when P is ready to say “Six,” that means he’s back. Two repeatedly demands, “Why?!” while P spouts nonsense.

Now P is training at boxing and Two plays his trainer. More questions about his resignation lead to an angry P decking his trainer.

Now it’s fencing. P defeats his trainer, knocking the foil out of his hands. The trainer tells P to kill him, mocking him as a coward. P backs the trainer against a door and stabs at him, missing him and losing the protective tip on the end of his foil to an impact with the door. The trainer once again implores him to kill and P stabs him in the shoulder. The trainer scolds him for missing and P apologizes. Two: “‘Sorry’? You’re sorry for everybody! Is that why you resigned?”

Now it’s a job interview, with Two playing the part of the interviewer at an established firm of bankers. P is hired, only to learn the job is a cover: he’ll be a spy, not just a bank clerk.

Now P is in traffic court with Two playing the judge. P has been cited for speeding. P pleads necessity: he was concerned with a life-and-death matter more important than traffic law. However, he cannot further explain to the judge, because it’s top secret. They repeat the Six/Five exchange, with P still stuck on Five. The judge convicts P and fines him 20 units. When P says he can’t pay and shouts at the judge for telling him “You are a unit of society,” he is charged with contempt of court and imprisoned.

After a nap, Two visits P in jail and they have the series’ most extensive discussion about his resignation. It’s fun, fascinating, and presented here in its entirety:

>**2:** “Why did you resign?”

>**P:** “For peace.”

>**2:** “For peace?”

>**P:** “Yeah, let me out.”

>**2:** “You resigned for peace?”

>**P:** “Yes, let me out.”

>**2:** “You’re a fool!”

>**P:** “For peace of mind.”

>**2:** “What?”

>**P:** “For peace of mind!”

>**2:** “Why?”

>**P:** “‘Cause too many people know too much.”

>**2:** “Never!”

>**P:** “I know too much!”

>**2:** “Tell me.”

>**P:** “I know too much about you!”

>**2:** “You don’t.”

>**P:** “I do.”

>**2:** “No, don’t.”

>**P:** “I know you.”

>**2:** “Who am I?”

>**P:** “You are an enemy.”

>**2:** “I’m on your side. Why did you resign?”

>**P:** “You’ve been told.”

>**2:** “Tell me again.”

>**P:** “I know you.”

>**2:** “You’re smart.”

>**P:** “In my mind…”

>**2:** “Yes?”

>**P:** “In my mind, you’re smart!”

>**2:** “Why did you resign?”

>**P:** “Yeah, you see?”

>**2:** “Why did you resign?”

>**P:** “You know who you are? A fool.”

>**2:** “What?”

>**P:** “Yes.”

>**2:** “No, no don’t.”

>**P:** “Yes, an idiot.”

>**2:** “I’ll kill you.”

>**P:** “I’ll die.”

>**2:** “You’re dead.”

>**P:** (grabs and shakes the cell door) “Let me out.”

>**2:** “Dead!”

>**P** grabs a knife from the kitchen — this isn’t a real-world jail — and passes it to **2** through the bars.

>**P:** “Kill me.”

>**2:** “Open it.”

>**P:** “OPEN IT!!!”

The Butler opens the door. Two enters, wielding the knife. P lies on the floor and tells Two, “Kill me lying down.” Two demands he get up, but P doesn’t.

Now it’s war. We’re in a plane, Two is playing the part of the pilot, and P is the bomber. During a countdown we get more of the Six/Five stuff with P still being stuck on Five. After they drop their bomb, they‘re hit and forced to bail out.

Now P is a POW and Two is playing his interrogator. The interrogator says he’s P’s friend and asks why he resigned. P starts counting down and, to Two’s surprise, says Six.

Six is back. And he’s hungry.

# Act Four

Two and Six are talking, with Two lying down on a table like a psychotherapy patient. Two explains that he chose Degree Absolute hoping to gain Six’s trust and confidence. They discuss how the method is like psychotherapy, and sometimes the doctor/patient roles can reverse.

Was any of this really necessary? Six asks Two a pointed question: “Why don’t you resign?” Two can only laugh and compliment Six on how well he plays the game.

Two pours drinks for the two of them. (The Butler doesn’t get one. ☹️) He gives Six a tour of the Embryo Room, where “You can relive from the cradle to the grave.” When they come to the clock, Two sees how much time is left: “FIVE MINUTES!”

Two — snap out of it, buddy! You have five minutes left, you don’t want to waste them fiddling with dials.

Six locks Two in the cell and hands the key to the Butler. Two laughs. “He thinks you’re the boss now!” Six answers, “I am.”

“I’m Number Two! I’m the boss! Open the door!” No dice. Should’ve poured him a drink, Two.

More back and forth with Six asserting his dominance and Two becoming terrified. By the time Six tells the Butler to open the door, Two is begging the Butler not to let him in.

The Butler opens the door, but Six doesn’t enter. Two tries to get something from him.

>**2:** “Why did you resign?”

>**6:** “I didn’t accept. Why did you accept?”

>**2:** “You resigned.”

>**6:** “I rejected.”

>**2:** “You accepted before you resigned.”

>**6:** “I rejected!”

>**2:** “Who?”

>**6:** “You.”

>**2:** “Why me?”

As Six counts down the seconds, Two gets on his knees and begs.

Two isn’t afraid of dying — he chose that. What he fears is dying for nothing. He wants to know what it was all for. What is Six’s big secret?

*Six has no answer to give him.* He isn’t what Two thinks he is. Everybody thinks he’s a superhero and wants him on their side. He isn’t a superhero and doesn’t belong on a side anymore. He’s just a guy who wants to be left alone. He wants to go on holiday. His only secret is the one Colin Gordon’s Two discovered in *AB&C* and it didn’t satisfy anyone.

Two pours himself another drink — I think I’d be drinking it from the bottle at this point — and pleads some more. Six shouts “Die! Die! Die!” as Two counts down the final seconds himself and expires.

P’s insensitivity, angry outbursts, and occasional cruelty have been recurring issues I’ve noted throughout the series. I’ve often questioned the extent to which he is a role model, and whether some of his actions are truly exemplary.

The Supervisor arrives and congratulates Six, who throws his glass to the floor as if angry about Two’s death — yet given his gloating about that a minute ago, he seems less concerned with Two’s death than with how it all affected *him*.

The Supervisor asks him what he desires. “Number One,” answers Six. “I’ll take you,” says the Supervisor.

# TO BE CONTINUED…

 

# Ruminations Regarding Resignation Reasons and Wrathful Rebukes

We learn back in Arrival that P has been open about his resignation, but nobody believes that he’s telling the whole story. In the minds of Twos, this is not “a man who walks out” and goes fishing. Of course he’s still fighting. He’s always fighting and always will. But how?

Perhaps he’s still fighting for his employer, and the resignation a deep-cover ploy. Perhaps he has switched loyalties and is now fighting for someone else. Perhaps he has his own personal mission, like Bond in *Licence to Kill*. But surely he’s not just quitting the business to let history unfold around him — that’s not what superheroes do.

That’s the biggest reason P never answers. He has no answer to give but what he already has given, and they don’t accept it, so what's the use of repeating it?

We never find out exactly what prompted P’s resignation. We know it was a matter of conscience (*Arrival*, *Chimes*). We know it was something that had been bothering him “for a very long time” (*Chimes*). We’re pretty sure he didn’t wake up angry that day or expecting to resign (*Forsake*), but he was very angry when he did resign (opening credits). I think he had moral reservations about his job for a very long time, something on that last day pushed him over the edge, and he quit both the agency and the business because there are too many moral compromises.

Here’s one idea of what it might have been:

>P’s employer sacrifices the life of a less valuable agent to protect P’s cover. A great guy with an adoring wife and five children, but less valuable to his employer than P.

>P says I’m sick of this coldbloodedness. I could have protected both him and my cover if you’d just trusted me. I’m outta here.

>His employer says, WTF? We just sacrificed this man’s life to ensure you can keep doing the job, and now you quit? If you’d quit 24 hours ago he’d still be alive and if you quit in ten years his death will count for something. Quitting now is the most horrible thing you can do to him.

>P says, more horrible than setting him up to die like you did?

>E thinks it had to be done for the greater good.  
P thinks it immoral and unnecessary.  
I think it understandable both feel righteous.  
U thinks nothing because he’s dead. Sucks to be U.

>I call the unfortunate agent U. P resigned “for peace of mind… too many people know too much… I know too much… [I know too much about U!](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OneLetterPun)” U died because too many people knew too much so P’s cover was imperiled, and P has no peace of mind because he knows too much about U: what a great person he was, how much his family loved and relied on him, how his employer set him up to die, how it was supposedly done for P’s benefit, and how his Accidental Death & Dismemberment benefits were reduced a week before he died.

What do we make of him shouting “Die! Die! Die!” at a dying Two? Cruelty, a man losing control of his anger, righteous justice, something symbolic, or something else? As model behavior, is it an example to follow, one to reject, or something I else?

1mwlgkb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mwlgkb/my_hatred_for_an_ex_friend_is_messing_with_my/,my hatred for an ex friend is messing with my daily life.,"i’m going to try to keep this short as possible which isn’t one of my strong suits. for privacy purposes i’m going to call this friend Megan. Megan and I were friends for years. We both grew up in the same town, graduated from the same hs and had a lot in common. we ended up befriending a friend group online. Megan hit it off with one of the guys and moved away to Ohio from our home state of PA. I also hit it off with one of these guys from Ohio but i was more cautious and played it safe…. me and this guy let’s call him John. we decided to do long distance and after a year we’d plan to get a place in his home town in Ohio and i’d move out there if all goes well. Well, things for me and john did go good and we got our apartment and i moved out there. 

Megan on the other hand her and her guy she originally was dating here broke up after a few months but she didn’t want to go home so she stayed with another friend from this group, Chris. at his parents house in his older sisters old room. Her and Chris start dating and then once i moved to Ohio officially… i’m not sure what happened to Megan but a switch flipped in her. she was passive aggressive toward me, lacked any kind of care, support, etc. toward me as moving away was hard on me mentally and she did not care!! all she wanted was for me to listen to her issues and hang out with her. she only cared about one she felt and what she wanted! when confronted she said she was tired of being a ppl pleaser and was living for herself now. but really that meant she was openly being a bitch and calling it healing. 

She tries to sabotage my relationship with John by trying to get into my head about his ex for no reason! she tried to convince me that i was so stressed that my mind was warped into hallucinating her being this way toward me but i had text to prove her saying evil, insane, cruel shit to me! She tried to cause a wreck with John as he drives a motorcycle sometimes to work and she was in front of him and brake checked him and caused him to have to go off the road to not hit her!! i confronted her on this and she thought it was funny!!! fucking funny??!! she was pointlessly cruel to me and him in many other ways… we both no longer speak to her but John is still friends with Chris as they have been friends since middle school! but Chris doesn’t know we don’t like Megan. we’ve tried to avoid her at all cost but the town we live in his small and John doesn’t want to leave and i also love it here! i love my life here, my job, the new friends i’ve made! 

it’s been over a year since i have spoken to or seen Megan. i ghosted her and she’s never confronted me on why! because i believe she knows secretly knows behind her victim complex that she was soooo shitty toward me!! i’ve never been able to get over what happened between me and Megan. how we’ve never hashed it out either bc i know she will try to turn it around on me and im such a people pleaser that it will work in her favor somehow. i have this deep hatred for her and its ruining my life. i feel i was as a bad mental point in my life and going through so much change and she shat on me when i’ve always been there for her!! ive been there for here through some tough stuff to like her brother SA her, im the one who came and got her in the middle of the night when an ex of hers was beating her!! just for her to do me like she did. 

i want to block her but i can’t bc it will cause a chain reaction in our friend group. my bf wants to block her too but we know we can’t bc we’re all friends with the same ppl. i hope for her and Chris to break up! she’s awful to him too she will turn off her location when they argue and they do now live in there own place but she will leave in her car without telling him, location off, go sit in a. parking lot and wait to see how long til he messages her… that’s insane, that’s mentally abusive?! i hate seeing her in the grocery store and trying to act nice and civil! i hate having to see her at birthday’s and weddings!! of our friends!! i hate going to the location coffee shop to read my book and chill out and seeing her car parked outside and having to just turn tf around bc i don’t want to see her face. i wish she would just go the hell back to PA. 

i’m being nicer in this post than my actual thoughts are more along the lines of i hate that bitch i hate that fucking bitch. i hate how she’s just living life and im tip toeing around her ass!!

Important notes: drinks two cups of coffee every morning on empty stomach, took more than 4 NSAIDS in one week, diet is restrictive with lots of water but also junk food and fatty/fried things for most dinners.
Past illness: Cold/Stomach Bug at the end of July, consisted of lots of diarrhea and anxiety.

Since Sunday, l've been dealing with this chest pain and dull sensation under my breastbone. I figured it was indigestion and it would clear in two days. Well, it wasn't exactly clearing up, and on top of that my pre-menstrual symptoms were flaring up (anxiety, crying, some cramps here and there). After trying to eat some ravioli in heavy cream Tuesday night, I immediately stopped when the food started tasting acidic. That was the final straw.

I visited an Urgent Care center yesterday morning (coincidentally when my period started!) and told them my symptoms. They checked my heart first through EKG and using the stethoscope, it was perfectly normal. They agreed that I should lay off things I consumed frequently such as coffee and tomato sauce for a bit, and they put me on a famotidine prescription (take one a day for a month).

Today is my first day on it and for a while, I felt better with eating some things. But my heart beat is still faster than normal, fatigue makes it hard to move for long periods of time and my breath is still short. Sometimes the chest pain even comes back. If anyone has any tips about diet changes, who I should speak to next about this, or anything about getting better, let me know! Thank you.

I'm mostly loving it so far but I am really disappointed in the journal's lack of specificity. I think it could be incredibly powerful as an accountability tool. The fact that you just say you ate but not what you ate feels like it falls incredibly short of the intention. 

For instance I had an insane day at work today. I know I shouldn't have but I got Taco Bell after I dropped my daughter off from an appointment because I didn't have anything at home and just needed something I could eat quickly in the car. I ate around the same time I usually do, but in general I have a salad, smoothie or egg bites for lunch. So if my numbers are off this afternoon, I feel like the algorithm isn't going to make sense of it as food related since I am logging lunch around the typical time.  But also knowing one had to type Taco Bell in, as opposed to just clicking ""lunch"" I have little doubt would help one to make better decisions. 

Similarly I had a coffee this morning before I came to work, then I had a matcha mid morning. Those are very different drinks and just logging caffeine seems inadequate. 

Even if, behind the scenes, it would be too complicated to have the system actually take these things into account, it feels like it would help people make better choices.

Pretty spur of the moment, I had been venting to a friend of mine about how impossible it is for someone like me to find a date or even meet people in person at all, and she ended up telling me to try a library. ""You can meet people at a library?"" I asked, and she just said ""Yes"", and for some reason I believed it for just long enough to commit to taking the bus down and getting my library card. 

The bus ride was nice and short, and way better than the walk all the way over there would have been. I pretty much stopped thinking about ""meeting"" someone at the library by the time I stepped foot outside my house, but the prospect of potentially finding a new public transporation routine down to the center of the city that I'd be fine doing more than twice a year was really nice. I ended up getting my library card and just kind of wandering around aimlessly without knowing what I would even do there.

I had found Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" and had planned to check that out, but the anxiety of being responsible for a book was kinda getting to me. Lucky for me though, I found the manga section (I forgot libraries even had these) and found some really cool stuff. They had all of Oyasumi Punpun (which I photographed, because of course I did), but I ended up grabbing Tatsuki Fujimoto's ""Goodbye, Eri"" and reading the whole thing there instead.

To be honest, I didn't really expect it to be short enough to read in under an hour, but it was nice to be able to get through it all in one sitting at the library itself. It felt nice checking a book out and turning it back in before I even left the building. I feel like I both benefited from and contributed towards a really useful public service. I kind of understand why everybody loves these things so much now.

The library is right next to a park, but I didn't really feel like sitting at the park today, so I ended up coming down to a coffee shop instead. The place was way less busy than I expected it to be, and the dude at the register was super chill, so my expectations for grabbing a coffee in the city were pretty much completely shattered. In a good way though, I prefer to not be inconvenienced, of course.

I'm probably just going to finish my coffee, check out a few of the small shops right down the street, and then head home either on the bus if the timing is right, or in an Uber. There's a 40 minute wait between stops. I don't know if that's normal, but it seems pretty stupid. I don't blame the transit systen itself though. I blame every nazi piece of shit in charge of funding all the roads and parking lots instead.

As always, I'll probably be back later. Take care again.",1,1755806061.0,u_despairingmoron,0,1.0,False

Ivy Aiko-Mori is a small time photographer which has gotten her a small following on her social media accounts. She often too shy for her own good and is very sweet and caring to those she hold close to her heart. She usually in some warm and cozy clothing sitting around a coffee shop maybe taking a picture or two for fun.

Bexy Nocturne is a tomboy-ish cat. She likes danger and being alone by herself. She also happens work to at a library, why? It’s always silent and she can be alone in her thoughts, plus it pays surprisingly well. She likes to get lost in her art “It’s the only proper way to express myself.” or so she says. And before you ask no she is not interested in you she already has her heart set on an overly sweet white fox. Just remember no means no and if you press your luck on her she might just give you a not so friendly reminder she’s allowed to openly carry a knife, a butterfly knife which she won’t hesitate to do overly complex and flashy tricks to remind you she’s more than a sassy black cat.

1mwlahz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1mwlahz/explore_the_best_cold_brew_coffee_maker_with/,Explore the best cold brew coffee maker with Hario Mizudashi,"With a deep appreciation for coffee brewing, I found myself exploring the Hario MCPN-14B Cold Brew Coffee Maker, intrigued by its simplistic design and promises of rich, cold coffee. As someone who drinks coffee like it's water, testing this product became part of my weekly brewing routine. Let me walk you through its quirks, perks, and surprises.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its sleek, minimalist appearance. Its black accents paired with the heatproof glass give it a modern yet practical look. The pot feels surprisingly light at just 11.2 ounces, but the glass is sturdy enough for daily use. Its slim shape makes it easy to fit in my fridge, even when space is tight. I’ve knocked it over once or twice (don’t ask how), and it stayed intact—thankfully, the glass isn’t overly delicate. While it may not scream premium, it certainly feels thoughtfully designed for home use.

**Functionality and Features**  
Using the device is as straightforward as it gets. The fine mesh basket allows for easy addition of ground coffee—around 80 grams worked best for me—and there’s no complicated assembly to worry about. I experimented with different grind levels, discovering that a coarser grind produced a smoother, lighter brew, while a finer grind amped up the intensity. The removable filter is another highlight since it makes cleanup a breeze. Once brewing is done, a quick rinse and you’re ready for the next batch.

**Cold Brew Taste and Quality**  
As someone who can be picky about the flavor of cold brew, I was impressed by how robust and smooth the coffee turned out. After an overnight steep in the fridge (about eight hours), the resulting coffee had a rich, full-bodied character with none of the bitterness you get from hot brewing. It delivers a quality on par with my local coffee shop’s cold brew—minus the hefty price tag. If you’ve ever thought of trying this brewing style at home, this product nails it.

[Check Hario MCPN-14B Cold Brew Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://designmara.com/p/b001vpxebu/)

**Ease of Use**  
This coffee maker truly leans into simplicity. The slender spout ensures a precise pour, which is especially handy for serving without spills. I’ve even used the pot to pour directly into iced coffee glasses for guests, and the process feels seamless. Since there’s no electric component, it’s completely manual, which makes it durable and free from technical glitches. On top of that, its compact design simplifies storage—it doesn’t hog counter space.

**Good Aspects**  
- Produces smooth, full-bodied cold brew without bitterness.  
- Straightforward setup and brewing process, accessible even for beginners.  
- Durable and made with high-quality heatproof glass.  
- Removable filter makes cleaning easy and reusable.  
- Compact design fits in any fridge or small kitchen space.  

**Critiques**  
- While the glass is sturdy, it may not withstand heavy impacts.  
- Doesn’t come with measurement markers for precise water or coffee amounts.  
- Not ideal for large gatherings as capacity is limited to 1000 mL.  

**Competing Products**  
When comparing it to other cold brew coffee options, I had my eye on the Takeya Deluxe Cold Brew Maker. The main advantage of the Hario, in my opinion, lies in the glass construction, which provides no aftertaste compared to plastics. On the flip side, Takeya offers a slightly sturdier design that travels better without the risk of breaking. Another contender is the Ovalware RJ3, which includes measurement markers for better brewing accuracy, though it feels heavier and sacrifices the simplicity of the Hario. This coffee pot excels with its clean aesthetic and user-friendly design, but for those prioritizing durability, alternatives like Takeya hold their ground.

**True Value**  
Cold brew fanatics who like an efficient, no-fuss setup will see value here. While some coffee contraptions come with a steep price for unnecessary frills, this coffee maker is refreshingly simple yet delivers professional-level results. It doesn’t have extras like auto timers or digital displays, but its quality builds and excellent coffee output more than justify the investment. If you’re hunting for an affordable way to dive into cold brew, this is a reliable pick.

How possible is it to find a moderately high or high-paying job or get a leadership position at work with only a high school (grammar school) diploma?

I met a guy who graduated from grammar school. He passed the compulsory matriculation exam (native language, Math, English) and physics as an elective. He says he was first on the list to enter mechanical engineering, but decided not to enroll, because he believes he is capable of ""ruling the world"" without a college degree. He says he wants to achieve the ""American dream"" because he has a ""brain with lots of innovative ideas"" - a 10 page document with philosophical ideas on ""how to change the world""...his only friend told me he is too broke to even pay for coffee, let alone afford to go to America.

He says he wants to earn money to buy an apartment and a car, but his job applications were rejected everywhere except in a small market, where he worked last summer,salary of 1100 euros per month. He can't drive a car with a manual transmission, only an automatic, because he is disabled, which, I think, is quite an obstacle.

So now I'm curious, where did he get such an idea? Is it really possible to find some kind of high-level business position in America with only a high school diploma?  I think it's impossible (and a LOT of people from our area said the same!) but since he says he's seen people like that on Reddit, I'm interested in what you think about this?? I'm interested in your experiences. Is it actually so easy to gain such a position? Or is he being delusional?

EDIT: grammar school here gives you no qualifications for any specific job unless you attend college. You can ex. only be a bartender or a cashier.",0,1755805794.0,AskAmericans,5,0.5,False

I have several Yeti mugs, tumblers, and bottles and have been very happy with them for coffee as I usually drink my coffee fairly quickly when drinking from the Mug, within an hour. Even if my coffee cools down to just “pretty warm” I usually have a sweetener in they that makes it okay to drink the last few ounces fast.

TEA on the other hand, I draw out the experience. I sip over a longer period of time and having a mug 1/3 full means my liquid is cooling off faster than I can drink it, and I don’t much enjoy lukewarm tea. With enough money tied up in my yetis and other drinkware, it was a hard sell to spend $130 for my niche of preference.

The white 10oz I saw the Member Plus section of my Best Buy app for $50, and I have a $15 credit! $35 mug?! A little small if I am drinking the tea over a long period but a great price I thought! Let me see if this is an old model with less features or something before I buy…

…and wow have I never been talked more out of a product than this thing 😆 these products do NOT seem good at all, from the pin issues, flaking paint, moldy lids, non-function units.. this company’s range of products seem like a complete MESS an seemingly have benefited to being the only real game in town. Wild!

So, this post is more for those of you who seem lucky enough to have had good experiences with the range over the years, a $50 if you happen to be a Best Buy plus member. Only reason why I am is related to a purchase I made last year for Christmas where it made sense to get it, and I do have to say there have been a few gems that have actually made that thing worth it, but that’s either here nor there. As far as the price, It’s just a little bit more expensive than what the charge plate is on its own plus you’re getting an extra mug so that seems worth it for those of you who are in this ecosystem. I’ve never been shy about taking a chance on technology that may or may not work out, but this feels like I’m buying something that’s doomed to fail from a company that doesn’t look like it’s gonna be around in a couple years if they keep on going down this spiral. That is, unless anyone wants to make a case defending the purchase? Seems like even the people who are happy with their products are a little “But yeah I understand that others are having issues and won’t deny that”.",1,1755805770.0,Ember,0,1.0,False
1mwl8s6,https://i.redd.it/bl43jausffkf1.png,Girl made a TikTok making fun of a text I sent about how much I liked her (it went viral) and ignored my apology/'confrontation',"TLDR: Apologies for the length of this - I’ve included all the context for anyone who is interested but all you need to know is that I really liked this girl - it didn’t work out and she was moving to Korea - I sent a very long text about how much I liked her - she blocks me and 6 weeks later makes a TikTok making fun of me - ignores my apology and ‘confrontation’ about it.



My context: I (M24) am not the most experienced with relationships. This girl ‘Sophie’ (F23) is the first girl I’ve ever liked and the only person I've wanted to talk to and see as much as possible. She’s not a big dater - she had one previous relationship that she said lasted ‘6 months/2 years’. It ended 4 years ago, and she’s not dated seriously since - she said I was the first since her ex.



Part 1:

Long story short I matched with Sophie in March 2024 on Hinge whilst I was doing a Masters in Edinburgh (I live in London). She texted me first and within a week I was hooked. Due to me being home over Easter and her having exams we didn’t meet up until about 6 weeks in, but had our 2nd date the night after the first. Over the next 6 weeks, we talk daily and see each other 5 times (but I was on holiday for 2 weeks of it and she was for a week) so even though the dates weren’t too frequent, when we were in the same place we were seeing every 4-5 days. 

She cancelled on the day of our next date and then went quiet for a couple of days before sending me a text saying she wasn’t in the ‘headspace for dating.’ I respond but was devastated. A few days later I send her a text basically making it very clear how much liked her, that I got the vibe it was mutual and it would be a shame for things to end if that was the case. She came back and seemed to hesitate. She said she didn’t know where she was at but she said she thought it would be nice to get to know me more. I give her a few days to think about it and when I followed up she confirmed she’s wasn’t in the headspace for dating and doesn’t want to lead me on. I also notice a couple weeks later that she hides her instagram stories from me.



Part 2:

That was June and I could not get her out of my head for the next 3 months. So in September I text her again (I had moved home at this point). We end up talking for the next 6 weeks. However, she tells me she is moving to Korea at the end of November for 6 months and she is super hot and cold. Like, A few weeks in she unhid her instagram stories from me and she’d be flirty without me initiating anything saying stuff like “Do you miss Edinburgh or miss me”, “Come to Korea with me” and (when talking about trying to save money “I’d make an exception to go out with you.” But other times she’d leave me on seen for 12+ hours. 

I have my graduation in Edinburgh at the end of October, so we agree to meet up on the night I am free. Also, over the course of us speaking, Sophie was offered a really great job and spent the final 3/4 weeks of us talking not knowing if she was going to stay for the job or go to Korea. Around the time we started talking my childhood dog started to get quite sick. She declined steadily but the week before my graduation started to take a turn for the worse and 2 days before we flew over the vet made it clear she didn’t have long and its up to us to decide when. We decide that me and my mum would still go for the 2 days, while my dad stayed, and we’d decide on timings when we were back. But because Sophie was so hot and cold, I was never confident the date would actually happen so I didn’t tell her the full extent.

We confirm the date the night before and agree to meet at 6pm as she had work the following morning. The day of, we were texting way than usual but at 5:15 she pushes it to 7:30 and then at 6:45, as she was still tight for time, she asks to meet somewhere closer to her. The date starts but I still don’t know if she is going to stay and take the job or go to Korea so about 10 minutes in I ask her and she confirms she’s going to go. I was really happy for her but I was also gutted that she was leaving. If she was staying, I was going to suggest ways that we could make the distance work and how we could give things a bit of a go. 

Then about 45 mins into the date, Sophie looks shocked as this group walks into the pub and say “They’re my friends.” I assumed these were acquaintances but it turns out they were her 2 best friends (and one of their boyfriends). I didn’t pick up on it at the time but they didn’t seem surprised to see her so I think it may have been a case of her mates crashing things. It turned into a group thing, and it was a good time but I was wanting to hang out with just her so between her moving and then her mates showing up, I just felt so defeated. They eventually leave, but we only stay for like 20 more mins before she had to go. We text a bit that night, both saying it was a good time but she started texting only once or twice day for the next few days and I had a horrible feeling she was going to ghost. So I send a text.



Text 1:

I said that with her off for 6 months, I knew things couldn’t progress right now, but I’d really like to keep talking while she’s away. I explained that I understood she’s probably not in the headspace to talk ‘seriously’ and I’m okay with that - I just really liked her and would rather those 6 months pass with us talking. She replied about 30 mins later, really bluntly, saying “Even if I wasn’t going to Korea, I don’t really think it’d work because I don’t really feel a romantic spark with you.” 

It really hurt, but it was also really confusing. We had spoken for like 4.5 months total at that point, met up multiple time over an extended period of time - I just didn’t see how ‘no spark’ could have come up for her at that point. She must have let enough of a spark the first time to engage when I got back in touch the second - never mind the fact she was flirty that second time. 



Text 2:

I don’t reply for 6 days because I spend it getting really clear on what I want to say. My dog had had begun to decline again so I’m spending most of time looking after her. I end up rushing the message out on Thursday night because we had decided to put her down the following week, and I didn’t want that and whatever the outcome of the text to happen at the same time.

I basically explain everything about my dog and told her we were having to put her down and only found out 2 days before the date. I just say I wasn’t in a great place so may have been off that night because I wasn’t really in the mood for a date but it was the only chance to see her. I finish it off but saying it would suck to judge it based off a night I wasn’t myself for. She opens it 30 mins after I sent it but just ignores it.



Text 3: 

We put my dog down 2 days after I sent text 2 and her ignoring that message really hurt me. My emotions were heightened with the dog situation but I spent the next 3 weeks where my head was all over the place. So on the day she was flying to Japan, I send her a very long and intense text. It covered everything - how much I liked her, how great I thought she was, how this was the first time I felt this way about someone and that she brought out a side to me I didn’t know I had. 

It was a very soppy and long message. I was hoping she would she how much I cared and reconsider but it was also a goodbye message. I just didn’t want something that meant that much to me to have such a shit ending with her ignoring that message about my dog. I had just never been open with my emotions like that before and didn’t know how to stop so I said everything and I do regret that. She opened it 20 mins after I sent it, then blocked me an hour and a half later. I have a pretty Christmas with that still weighing on me and the whole dog situation. I just felt really sad all the time and pretty stupid to have cared that much.



Post Block:

6 weeks later I’m scrolling on TikTok and a video pops up of these 2 girls reading something intently on a phone and laughing. There was a text overlay saying “the only good thing about dating are the ridiculous paragraphs men send you that you can show the girls.” I realised they were Sophie’s mates that I met on the date and that it was Sophie’s account. The caption quoted a line from my last text: “I know you’re off but…” followed by, “Nah, are you actually well? Last coffee with the girls before I left was a good one. Stay safe out there, girls.” 

I didn’t know she had TikTok but turns out she posts regularly and gets 1/2,000 views. But this one got 200,000 views, and 30,000 likes. It really devastated me tbh. I already felt so guilty about being blocked seeing that just really knocked me. About a month later she references me in another caption saying “No dating wrapped this year because it had me traumatised” and a month after that she posts the reaction video again (as part of a trend) with the caption “I just love this reaction video so much.”



Now:

I decided that I was going to get in touch to apologise for my part, give her some context of how things got to that point and tell her I saw the TikTok and it was really hurtful. I sent the text (pic attached) on Sunday night and she read it less than an hour later but didn’t reply.

I feel really let down. I know I didn’t handle things as well as I could’ve done but it was a very honest message and to see my feelings turned into content was horrible. It’s really messed with my head over the past 8 months to the point I started seeing a therapist and I feel like I deserve more than her just ignoring it. But I don’t know if I’m overreacting and being overly sensitive. I don’t think I am but is really thought she was going to reply.",2,1755805763.0,whatdoIdo,6,0.75,False
1mwl8jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1mwl8jl/fruit_of_a_fertile_imagination_or_reality/,Fruit of a fertile imagination or reality?,"Hi guys, I'm Brazilian and this is my first post in this community!

I start by saying that I'm a little skeptical about paranormal things until I actually see them, in short, I only believe by seeing or feeling them, I'm a little ignorant about these things.

Since I was a child, I have always been interested in the world of horror and it was at that time that my first story takes place: at the time I must have been between 9 and 11 years old and I was very interested in creepypastas, especially the bloodthirsty ones. I already had a certain knowledge about the supernatural, it was basic, but I did. I vaguely remember this event to this day, I was always a child who was terrified of the dark and because of that I slept with my bedroom door and the bathroom light on (it is next to my bedroom door), it must have been very late after all, my house and the street were already silent when I woke up. The light that was normally supposed to be on was off and the door to my room was closed. I remember starting to feel very afraid and a presence with me. A few minutes passed and the darkness in my room didn't go away, it was as if my vision couldn't get used to the lack of light. (Just for context, my bed is in front of the wardrobe, so I sleep with my feet facing one of the doors) I heard the sound of the old wooden door of my wardrobe opening, so as a reaction I looked in the direction of my feet and there was nothing inside, just darkness and from the complete darkness came a white face similar to that of a famous creepypasta (and it's thanks to this part that I had a hard time believing it was something real) he stared at me smiling and there he stayed watching me until I passed out.

Second story: thanks to my bad memory I can't remember exactly when it was, but I was still a child. At that time I still slept with the door open and the bathroom light on. I remember waking up in the middle of the night again feeling someone watching me in the living room (which is in front of my bedroom door, yes it is a tiny house!), there was a woman in a big blue dress walking towards the kitchen of my house and, again, I passed out from fear.

Third story: I was 17 years old at the time (I remember because it's more recent) I spent years without seeing anything like that, just feeling strange presences in my house and seeing figures, which is normal. But then I started to see her, a girl in white dresses, pale skin and a kind of hat, her face didn't have eyes but two black holes. This thing watched me from corners and wherever I went, regardless of which place it was, whether there were many people or not, whether it was an open place or not (it was enough to have somewhere that served as a “border”), after a few months I stopped seeing it.

Third report: now at 18 years old I see more things, I will divide this part into 2 places (my room and a friend's house) My room: yes, this is still the same room as the other reports and it still takes place in the same corner. For a few months now I've been living a life locked in my room, let's say I hate people and being in their presence. I got into the habit of being on call playing and watching with a colleague, usually my camera is on and I sit right in front of my bed (context, a few months ago a window was installed that gives a view of the side corridor of the house, the same corner where the wardrobe in the first reports is located) after hours of playing and watching, I usually see something passing by my window (I see it through my camera) walking slowly and the entire time I watch myself on the camera or I'm lying in my bed I feel like there's someone there. standing there, looking at the door. I can't explain what it is, but my friend also sees it and, when he came to sleep here, he said he could barely stay in here. Friend's house: just for context: this is the same friend who is on call with me. The first time I went to his house everything was normal, we sat, played and talked, but you know that feeling of wanting to leave even though I really enjoyed being there? So, this always happened, not to mention the unbearable sleep I felt when it was getting dark and I was there. After a few trips there I saw that man standing in the corner of his grandmother's room, the room was a little dark, but he stood out in the gloom of the corner he was in (he was completely black so I couldn't see his clothes), I asked my friend if he had ever seen something similar and he told me yes and that his grandmother had too. A few weeks later, after a night of drinking, I missed my bus schedule and ended up sleeping there. The other morning we went to have coffee in the kitchen, I sat in a chair that overlooks the living room and a bedroom door behind a sofa. Conversation goes on, conversation comes, my friend leaves the table and goes to make us something to eat and it was then, minutes later, that I saw a black hand come out from behind the door, hold it and open it slowly without making any noise (the door is heavy and creaks a lot when it opens), I mentioned it to him, but I was ignored. More recently I went to sleep at his house again, his relatives had gone out and he went to the market to buy some ingredients so I could cook, thus leaving me alone at home. I was in the kitchen and I heard a very low noise and at the same time I saw a figure passing to the bedroom side of the heavy door, I went up the steps and walked in front of the door (staying a little away from it and behind the sofa) then I saw that thing, a pale face came out from one of the ends of the door and started to watch me motionless, it didn't seem to care about my presence or the fact that I was seeing it. I stood there looking at her without being able to do anything and, after a few seconds, she began to disappear into the darkness. That same day I felt tempted to go into that room and, almost uncontrollably, I went in there and there was nothing.

She declined steadily but the week before my graduation started to take a turn for the worse and 2 days before we flew over the vet made it clear she didn’t have long and its up to us to decide when. We decide that me and my mum would still go for the 2 days, while my dad stayed, and we’d decide on timings when we were back. But because Sophie was so hot and cold, I was never confident the date would actually happen so I didn’t tell her the full extent.

We confirm the date the night before and agree to meet at 6pm as she had work the following morning. The day of, we were texting way than usual but at 5:15 she pushes it to 7:30 and then at 6:45, as she was still tight for time, she asks to meet somewhere closer to her. The date starts but I still don’t know if she is going to stay and take the job or go to Korea so about 10 minutes in I ask her and she confirms she’s going to go. I was really happy for her but I was also gutted that she was leaving. If she was staying, I was going to suggest ways that we could make the distance work and how we could give things a bit of a go. 

Then about 45 mins into the date, Sophie looks shocked as this group walks into the pub and say “They’re my friends.” I assumed these were acquaintances but it turns out they were her 2 best friends (and one of their boyfriends). I didn’t pick up on it at the time but they didn’t seem surprised to see her so I think it may have been a case of her mates crashing things. It turned into a group thing, and it was a good time but I was wanting to hang out with just her so between her moving and then her mates showing up, I just felt so defeated. They eventually leave, but we only stay for like 20 more mins before she had to go. We text a bit that night, both saying it was a good time but she started texting only once or twice day for the next few days and I had a horrible feeling she was going to ghost. So I send a text.

Text 1:

I said that with her off for 6 months, I knew things couldn’t progress right now, but I’d really like to keep talking while she’s away. I explained that I understood she’s probably not in the headspace to talk ‘seriously’ and I’m okay with that - I just really liked her and would rather those 6 months pass with us talking. She replied about 30 mins later, really bluntly, saying “Even if I wasn’t going to Korea, I don’t really think it’d work because I don’t really feel a romantic spark with you.” 

It really hurt, but it was also really confusing. We had spoken for like 4.5 months total at that point, met up multiple time over an extended period of time - I just didn’t see how ‘no spark’ could have come up for her at that point. She must have let enough of a spark the first time to engage when I got back in touch the second - never mind the fact she was flirty that second time. 



Text 2:

I don’t reply for 6 days because I spend it getting really clear on what I want to say. My dog had had begun to decline again so I’m spending most of time looking after her. I end up rushing the message out on Thursday night because we had decided to put her down the following week, and I didn’t want that and whatever the outcome of the text to happen at the same time.

I basically explain everything about my dog and told her we were having to put her down and only found out 2 days before the date. I just say I wasn’t in a great place so may have been off that night because I wasn’t really in the mood for a date but it was the only chance to see her. I finish it off but saying it would suck to judge it based off a night I wasn’t myself for. She opens it 30 mins after I sent it but just ignores it.



Text 3: 

We put my dog down 2 days after I sent text 2 and her ignoring that message really hurt me. My emotions were heightened with the dog situation but I spent the next 3 weeks where my head was all over the place. So on the day she was flying to Japan, I send her a very long and intense text. It covered everything - how much I liked her, how great I thought she was, how this was the first time I felt this way about someone and that she brought out a side to me I didn’t know I had. 

It was a very soppy and long message. I was hoping she would she how much I cared and reconsider but it was also a goodbye message. I just didn’t want something that meant that much to me to have such a shit ending with her ignoring that message about my dog. I had just never been open with my emotions like that before and didn’t know how to stop so I said everything and I do regret that. She opened it 20 mins after I sent it, then blocked me an hour and a half later. I have a pretty Christmas with that still weighing on me and the whole dog situation. I just felt really sad all the time and pretty stupid to have cared that much.



Post Block:

6 weeks later I’m scrolling on TikTok and a video pops up of these 2 girls reading something intently on a phone and laughing. There was a text overlay saying “the only good thing about dating are the ridiculous paragraphs men send you that you can show the girls.” I realised they were Sophie’s mates that I met on the date and that it was Sophie’s account. The caption quoted a line from my last text: “I know you’re off but…” followed by, “Nah, are you actually well? Last coffee with the girls before I left was a good one. Stay safe out there, girls.” 

I didn’t know she had TikTok but turns out she posts regularly and gets 1/2,000 views. But this one got 200,000 views, and 30,000 likes. It really devastated me tbh. I already felt so guilty about being blocked seeing that just really knocked me. About a month later she references me in another caption saying “No dating wrapped this year because it had me traumatised” and a month after that she posts the reaction video again (as part of a trend) with the caption “I just love this reaction video so much.”



Now:

I decided that I was going to get in touch to apologise for my part, give her some context of how things got to that point and tell her I saw the TikTok and it was really hurtful. I sent the text (pic attached) on Sunday night and she read it less than an hour later but didn’t reply.

I feel really let down. I know I didn’t handle things as well as I could’ve done but it was a very honest message and to see my feelings turned into content was horrible. It’s really messed with my head over the past 8 months to the point I started seeing a therapist and I feel like I deserve more than her just ignoring it. But I don’t know if I’m overreacting and being overly sensitive. I don’t think I am but is really thought she was going to reply.",8,1755805371.0,AmIOverreacting,19,0.79,False

Relationship was wonderful and I thought I’d found my person. 1 week from six months and a couple of days before meeting my mom he discarded me over text. Not even two hours before he was telling me how much he loved me and how wonderful everything is. Gave no real reason or context. 

We’ve had very limited contact and I got all my stuff back four weeks ago (he dragged that out), or so I thought. The other night I realized that he’d held onto something of emotional value to me - which he was definitely aware of. 

I reached out to ask for it back and he immediately tried to pick a fight over nothing. After a few back and forths and me being like this has nothing to do with getting my item back, just get it to me he asks me to go for coffee tomorrow.

Jason Schreier's Interview With Team Cherry Highlights,"https://preview.redd.it/83cdi7owbfkf1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=1712fbe3cc159cafedfb8ff19ccfebd76fb9580c

“Even at that point we were recognizing that it was going to become another giant thing to rival the scale of *Hollow Knight* or probably exceed it,” Gibson said. “And then because of how we work, obviously **the world ended up being just as big or bigger.** And the quest system existed. And the multiple towns existed. Suddenly you end up six, seven years later.” 

\---  
“You’re always working on a new idea, new item, new area, new boss,” Pellen said. “That stuff’s so nice. It’s for the sake of just completing the game that we’re stopping. We could have kept going.”

The downside of this methodology was that it could have lasted forever.

“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” Gibson said. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”

\---

“We felt like continued updates were just going to sour people on the whole thing,” Gibson said. “Because all we could really say is, ‘We’re still working on it.’”

**They wanted to be particularly cautious about avoiding spoilers.** Much of the thrill of *Hollow Knight* came from accidentally stumbling upon secret passageways or breaking down walls to find hidden bugs. *Silksong* has plenty of its own secrets that they didn’t want to detail before the release.

\---  
*Silksong* briefly resurfaced in 2022 during an Xbox event, which promised that all of the games shown would be out within a year. Xbox doubled down on Twitter, saying the *Hollow Knight* sequel would be out before June 2023.

At the time, they all thought it was true. “We did genuinely believe that was the case,” Pellen said. “There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.”

But the game kept growing. *Silksong* has more elaborate bosses than *Hollow Knight*, more gameplay systems and more interactivity. Gibson and Pellen wanted objects in the world to react to Hornet’s various tools, which required a ton of drawing and animation work.

\---

Perhaps the biggest reason *Silksong* took so long was that Team Cherry never had to worry about the one thing that keeps other independent developers awake at night: money.

During the production of *Hollow Knight*, they’d stayed lean, sometimes living off leftover triangle sandwiches that their office neighbor would bring them after meetings. “My dad would sometimes pop up and give me $20,” Gibson said. “I’d be like, ‘Oh, I’m having coffee today!’”

Thanks to their first game’s massive financial success, Gibson and Pellen no longer have to scrounge leftovers. For Pellen, who has two kids and a third on the way, that’s provided an inestimable peace of mind. For Gibson, who said he spends most of his time at the office, it hasn’t changed much. “I live in a very basic two-bedroom apartment,” he said. “Sometimes I think, ‘You know what would be better, is a one-bedroom apartment.’ Because then there’s even less to maintain.”

\---  
Gibson and Pellen say they’re happy that the game is finally coming out — and even happier that they will get to keep working on it, which they still find enjoyable even after seven years. They haven’t burned out or shown any desire to take a break. **Instead, they’re already making big plans to add extra content to** ***Silksong*** **in the months and years to come.**",14,1755804900.0,Silksong,2,1.0,False

‘If You Could Go Back For One More Day’

I’m 80 years old. And somehow…
I woke up in my 32-year-old body.
Just for one day.

Little hands tug at the blankets.
“Mommy, wake up!” they laugh.
I blink, I sit up—
My babies.
Small again.

I gasp. I cry.
They climb into bed,
giggling, wiggling.
I used to rush through mornings—
but not today.

I pull them close.
I hug them tight.
I kiss their messy hair,
their tiny hands in mine.
This time,
I soak in every second.

In the mirror—
no deep lines,
no grey hair.
My younger face.
I used to think I looked old at 41.
What a silly thought.

In the kitchen,
my husband makes coffee.
Strong. Young.
I wrap my arms around him,
and hold on.
He looks surprised.
Maybe we didn’t hug enough back then.

We talk about nothing.
But today, it feels like everything.
I memorize the sound of his voice.

The car ride—
kids bickering over seatbelts,
crumbs everywhere.
I used to be so frustrated.
Today, I soak it in.
One day my car will be quiet, spotless, but not today.

Dinner—
loud, unorganized,
full of shouting, giggling,
life spilling over.
I don’t clean up right away.
I just sit and watch.
Trying to burn it into memory.

Before bed, I call my mom.
Her voice—
I haven’t heard it in years.
“Mom…”
I close my eyes,
let her words wash over me.
I tell her I love her,
again and again.
This time, I leave nothing unsaid.

At bedtime,
I don’t skip pages.
Not tonight.
I read every word.
Then I ask, “One more book?”
With excitement they say yes.
I don’t want this day to end.

Because this time,
I knew.

This was joy.
This was love.
The little hands,
the messy dinners,
our strong young bodies,
our parents still alive.

It all mattered.
So much more
than we ever realized.

Taking Inspiration from SMG4 Tari and comic books like Ninja Turtles like did you know in original Mirage Ninja Turtles Comics Turtles lived with April for while and near her once they found a new home?

Like imagine if ending was better right and Tari kept her Physical Body and with the bad guys out of the way and after leaving at MD5 headquarters Tari decides to get her own apartment she brings Theo along I figured it would Probably be near by MD5 headquarters since she would probably be in competitive Gaming scene with rest of MD5 as her teammates

My Headcanon in this scenario is that Tari neighbors in apartment are Meta Runner versions of Some SMG4 Characters like Runner version of Saiko, Meggy and Karen & her kids with Lucinia and Belle living just one floor above

I imagine the rest of MD5 have spare key to Tari apartment

There would be a lot of duck themed stuff like Tari would probably have a lot of coffee cups with ducks on them she would say ""be Careful with that it's apart my collection""

**Jets** need to have better flight controls (Please Look at War Thunders flying controls as an example. NOTE: I'm not asking for War Thunders damage system).

**Helicopters** need to have there BF4 movement return & the Anti-Air needs to be nerfed because having Anti-Air guns at Objectives, Anti-Air Tanks, Anti-Air at HQ Spawns & Anti-Air Personal Missiles (Stingers) is just to much for Helicopters to deal with right now.

**Tanks** need to be made stronger but in return repairing shouldn't be as strong as it currently is. With the current system the Tanks feel terrible when you are by yourself operating them but if you have a few people repairing your tank you will become a nearly unstoppable force which isn't super fun to fight against. (Even if its Epic).

***Weapons:***

**DMR's** need rebalanced they felt terrible to use & almost no one I played with used them & almost no one I went against was using them.

The **Shotgun** needs nerfed (I know this is gonna happen but I just wanted to make the point here).

**Snipers** need to have there sweet spot mechanic removed, Its not fun at all to die to someone & not be able to get revived just because they camped themselves at the perfect distance.

***Systems:***

**Bloom** on ALL forms of weapons NEEDS to be removed!!! Dying because my bullets didn't go where I aimed is one of the worst feelings in this game right now & it NEEDS to go. Bloom is one of the biggest reasons as to why I stopped playing BF1.

Certain maps need to have there **Spawns** worked on for objectives the biggest example I can give on this is the C objective on Empire State currently the spawn system just spawns you into the open which is not acceptable.

**Reviving** needs some improvements, Right now reviving by dragging people feels great but reviving with Defibrillators feels off & not natural.

The **Scoreboard** needs some improvements, This will sound ironic but BF2042 currently has a better Scoreboard that BF6.

Anyone else love gunslinger tricks? Like those guys that can shoot silver dollars and flip pistols safely and shit? Good, me too, and have since I was a kid and saw tombstone, outlaw Josie wales and such.
Me and my dad would bond over these movies, and I loved trying to replicate the tricks with my nerf guns, and toy caps guns and such, actually got pretty good for a 10 year old. Fast forward a buncha years, me and my dad didn’t watch the movies as much, but the gunslinger tricks had morphed into a fidget, I would flip just about anything around in my hand, ESPECIALLY if it had a ring/loop (like a revolver would have a trigger guard). My water bottle was one of my favorites at the time. Soon after that I got a job in a small town bike shop, and was gifted a metal coffee mug, think traditional shape, but lightweight aluminum, similar to some camp/travel mugs. That MUG was perfect for flipping around in my hand, I could even mimic some of the gunslinger tricks. It was around that same time I started drinking more coffee from the stress of the job and it was free. One morning I had come into work and went to grab my coffee mug from my work bench as I did every morning. I would always pick it up with a “gunslinger trick” flourish. Well this morning the other guy I work with decided to do me a solid and make me a cup of coffee when he made his. Unfortunately I was in my routine and didn’t notice, set my bag down and grabbed the mug flipping boiling hot coffee directly onto my bare arms and chest/belly. I shouted, tore my shirt off and the other guy came running into the repair shop from the other room, obviously startled by that. He asked what happened, and I angrily and confusedly told him I burned myself, he asked how I managed that, I snapped I wasn’t entirely sure, but coffee was the weapon. We pretty quickly figured out that it was my coworker that set the “clutz-trap” accidentally and with good intentions. He actually hollered at me when I walked in about the coffee and I didn’t hear him cuz of my headphones. As I have a history of hurting myself in many and minor ways, I have a bunch of nurse friends/relatives I call for quick advice. We called one or two, got some quick advice for me, then my coworker gave me a ride home after buying me some aloe Vera lotion as an apology. I didn’t blister so the burns weren’t bad enough for a hospital, I was just bright red from neck to waist. I was off the rest of that week and had a hard time lifting things and hugging for a month or two. Think “really bad sunburn”, was rough but coulda been worse.

TL;DR: Flipped a cup of coffee onto myself trying to be a “cool gunslinger” ended up being the “Kool-aid Man” instead, OHHHH NOOOOO

Edit: couple typos, also I just remembered that the same coworker also once left a bunch of those silver thumbtacks point up on the shop counter after doing the bulletin board, and I put my hand down directly onto them, Dude was amazing at accidentally setting “clutz-traps” right where I would hit them 🤣",7,1755804309.0,tifu,1,0.89,False
1mwkl4h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1mwkl4h/do_you_clean_your_nespresso_regularly_if_so_how/,"Do you clean your Nespresso regularly? If so, how often, and what's your process?","I'm a relatively new Nespresso Vertuo owner, and I've heard a plethora of random cleaning tips from Redditors to supposedly help improve the life of the machine. My machine gets used once every other day, with filtered water.

Currently, every second or third time the machine is used, I eject the capsule and use a paper towel to catch any stray coffee residue on the brewing device at the top of the inside of the machine (above the cup). I wipe out the cup, and around the outside of the cup. I also remove the water tank and use a paper towel to remove any standing water in the water tank connector underneath (there's usually a lot!). I then leave the water tank empty and separate from the machine.   
(I always eject the capsule + empty water tank after every brew - the other parts of the process are done every couple of times)

Is this a good cleaning process? Too much/too little? I saw a thread the other day about running an ""emptying cycle"" to avoid mold growing inside the water line in the machine. Should I be worried about this if it's only being used every other day? 

I've also been leaving the machine closed when not in use (cats + cat hair will get into it) - hopefully this isn't terrible for mold growth/proper drying?

I would love to know what others do to clean or protect their machines, and if there's any other issues or tips I need to be aware of. Thanks in advance!",1,1755804252.0,nespresso,3,1.0,False

1mwkj46,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveLetters/comments/1mwkj46/what_i_will_never_tell_you/,What I will never tell you,"Dear You,

Sometimes I find myself thinking that life is too short, and I should just tell you how I feel.  Even though it is unreciprocated, surely it’s never a bad thing to know someone loves you?

When you told me you loved me, all those years ago, I felt awful for you that I didn’t reciprocate, but also it meant the world to me.  Because I believed you.  And being loved really mattered.  So maybe it’d be the same in reverse this time?

Of course, we were much younger then, and things were very different. Still, without your confession, I’m not sure I would have ever fallen for you.  I already loved you as a friend, and probably would never have thought of you any other way.

But you did confess.  And I did fall in love right back.  Which is all the more reason I should keep this to myself.

And here I am, decades later, in love with you all over again, when I have absolutely no right to feel that way.  You haven’t loved me in a long long time, and I count myself lucky that you have let me back into your life at all.

Friendship with you is worth pretty much anything, as far as I am concerned. I can’t risk losing you again.

So trust me when I say that I know it’s a bad idea to tell you how I feel.  Instead let me say here, where you won’t read it, the things I will never tell you.

The truth is that I love you so much I can’t think straight. 

You are the person I want to share everything with, every high and every low.  

You are my first thought when I wake.  I fall asleep thinking about you.  

I love hearing about your day, whether there’s a funny story or something you want to vent about, or whether it’s just some tedious crap you by are sick to the back teeth of.  

I love your enthusiasm for cinema and encyclopaedic knowledge of things I find interesting.  

I love how you always have time for people.  

I love that you are so practical and down to earth, and yet spontaneous and full of enthusiasm for the small joys to be found in life.

I love your sense of humour, as well as your serious side.

I love so much about you, so many little things. There is nothing about you that I don’t find worth loving, even the few things I don’t like.

I wish I could be the one to give you a back rub after a stressful day. 

I wish I could be the one to bring you coffee and check on you when you are working at home.

I wish I could be the one to cuddle up to you on the sofa to watch a film or the football.

I wish I could be the one to go shopping with you, cook with you, and just do life with you.

I wish I could be the one to look after you when you need it, and even when you don’t.

I wish I could get to kiss you and caress you.  I wish I could feel your hands on my body in the most intimate ways.  I wish I could do the same with you.  I wish I could tell you my deepest fantasies and get to live them with you.  I wish you would tell me yours, and for us to live those too.

I just love you.  And I wish there was a universe where I was the woman you deserve, you loved me back, and we could be together.

I’ve always loved you, and I always will.

Forever yours,

I am getting this laptop to start setting up a therapy business for myself while on parental leave, which includes building online marketing tools for IG, using canva and Microsoft word or Google doc, spreadsheets. I will also be taking online classes on it as well as meetings for a board I am part of.

'I can’t sleep’. When asked what was wrong that was the easiest answer. I found it satiated most people when they asked. It was quick, to the point and didn’t involve delving into the inner depths of my psyche. It wasn’t a lie, I couldn’t sleep, but it wasn’t the full truth either. Every night I would lie in bed for hours, staring at the ceiling. I know each bump and imperfection in the peeling plaster to almost perfection; I’ve spent countless boring hours counting the specs of dirt and grime, trying to fall asleep. Then one day I gave up on trying. 

I’ve taken to walking around at night, my mother doesn’t notice or care so I can slip out easily. The city remained cold and empty, so long as you keep off the main street, and there was a catharsis in the silence that came with solitude. There was a small coffee shop that other nighttime lurkers and I were frequent patrons of. It was the only one that stayed open late enough. The young woman that was often behind the counter had stopped asking why ‘a young man like me was up so late’. I doubted that she believed the excuses I made every time, but she never pressed. 
Today I’d decided not to get a coffee. It was a detour from the path, and detours would let me question things. I was walking down a dimly lit cobbled street, rubbing my hands together to keep warm. Incremental light fixtures cut harshly into the night with their yellow beams. A man swathed in a blanket was fast asleep against a wall, legs tucked up so that he was just out of the light. I wondered if he’d done that intentionally.

I reached the entrance to a street that cut across to the riverside. It was that way that I was headed. All the shops down this stretch of street were dark except one, it’s bright lights bled into the dim of the street like an oil spillage. I found myself almost shrinking away from it as I passed. The stark white lights of the corner shop did not belong in this world. A world of dark, loneliness and the glint of cat’s eyes.

When I reached the river, I stopped for a second and lent on the guardrails. The inky black water seemed to stretch on forever. It disappeared over the horizon and into the ocean. The nearby boats looked like shadowy beasts in the gloom. The wind ruffled my hair as I stared into the depths. I used to walk past this spot on my way to school. It had been a place of comfort, until the other kids threw my school bag into the water. I’ve been without one ever since. My grip tightened on the rail. 

The bridge was a cold web of peeling iron. The white paint had been tainted by time and now was now a foul beige. A cars headlights lit up the road blinding me momentarily, a rare sight. The car slid by and disappeared into the night. A local tale of a couple committing suicide on this bridge made it wildly unpopular. The tail went that they had lost their first child, and the grief had been too much. Part of me hated to taint its reputation more but I had decided this would be the place. It had to be here, maybe my brain was trying to exert a little control before the end. 

I placed my hand on the rail and hoisted myself up. I shifted over so that I was sitting with my legs hanging over the edge. It looked a lot further from here. I felt a small bubble of fear well in my stomach pushed it down. This was what I wanted. I knew. I stood and the wind blew a little harder, as if trying to push me back from the edge. 

No.

This is what I want.

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath…

“It’s cold, isn’t it?”. I jumped in fright and almost slipped off into the water. My eyes darted back, that fear returning once again, but it was accompanied by an emotion I couldn’t place. Standing, back leant up against the rail and head rolled back so that she was staring at me, was a girl. She looked around my age, maybe a bit older, with a round face and deep blue eyes. Her hair was cut short so that it curled around her ears and there was a single purple strand that was a little longer than the others. “wha-who?”. Why didn’t I hear her before? She ignored my stammering, “Yo” she said with a hint of irony, “I don’t think we’ve talked before, but I’ve seen you around. You stopped coming in to school, right?”. I didn’t speak for a second, struggling to think what to say. “I-I-uhh…yeah. Yeah, I did. Do…I know you?”. 

“I just told you, we’ve never spoken”. 

“R-right”. I didn’t recognise her at all. “Which class are you in?” I asked. 

“My form room is just next to yours”.  

“Room 3?” 

“yeah”. Why was this conversation so casual, surely, she could see what he was trying to do? There was a pause. “Are you going to try to stop me? Cus I won’t. I’ve made up my mind”.

 She turned so that her whole body was facing me. “I wasn’t gonna, no” 

“Well then what…”

“I wanna talk” 

“What?”

“I wanna talk to you”

“Well...”, this was so bizarre. “Well, I…what?”. 

“Nothing specific, I just wanna talk”. 

I stared at her. “Here?” I asked. 

“Nah” she held out a hand to help me down “Let’s Walk and talk”. I didn’t move. “Come on, you may as well, it won’t take too long”. There was a short pause, “we have all night”. 

We began walking side by side. Neither of us spoke for a long while but I kept steeling glances at her. She was walking with one hand in her pocket and the other fell semi-loose at her side, swinging slightly. Her lips were curved in a constant small smile, as if just breathing brought her joy. She caught my eye during one of my glances and I quickly turned back to face forward, cheeks slightly red. 

A few more minutes passed, and I realised that we were one turn away from the main road. I cleared my throat, “I don’t wanna walk this way”. She looked at me and cocked her head slightly “Why?”. 

“I don’t wanna go on the main street, It’s too…much”. 

She nodded, “We can go a different way, uhhhh this way, I know a spot”. She turned down a small alley to our left and I followed. 

“You know the city quite well then?” she asked. 

“yeah”, it was a lame reply, but I didn’t know what to say. 

“How come?”. 

I hesitated as I thought how to respond “I come out at night a lot”.

“Really? Why”  

“Well why are you out” I mumbled in response. 

“touché” she grinned “I wasn’t judging, I just wanted to know what attracted you to it”. 

“it’s quiet…well…most of the time, and it’s better than lying in bed all night”. 

“what’s keeping you up” 

“I don’t know” I lied. 

“I’ve heard some people say that it can be to do with finding satisfaction in your day. Did your days stop being satisfying?”

“What are you, my therapist?” I jabbed. 

“Sorry, Sorry. I have a habit of doing that”

“What? Being nosey?”

“No…well, yes, but it’s more just asking questions. It drives a lot of people up the wall and sometimes my curiosity can get the better of me. It really can piss people off”. 

She glanced up at the sky as she said this and then looked back to me.

""Sorry for digging”. 

I hesitated for a second then replied “It’s ok. I just…you’re right, my days aren’t satisfying. They haven’t been for a long time”. There was a silence for another minute. I felt a lot more relaxed than I had. Being with her didn’t seem as daunting as being with other people. 

“Can I ask you a question?” I asked.

“Hit me”

“Do you go out at night a lot?” 

“Yeah”

“Can I ask why?”

“Because the night is beautiful”

“Is that all?”

“Do I need to have more of a reason?”. I thought about it, 
""no. No you don’t”. She stopped and looked up,
“You know some people say that the night sky, the stars, are like a window to heaven. Each one a different angel. Look at them”, 

I did, 

“Each one shining down on us, each its own life” she looked back to me, “You get me?”

“You’re not who I expected you to be”.

 She grinned, looking very satisfied “good, I like surprising people”

While we were talking, we’d walked down that alley and come out onto a street, she’d led me down, away from the city centre, until we reached the side of a tall apartment complex. She tapped my shoulder “We’re here”. 

“where’s here-Hey wait!”, she had started to run down the little alley next to the building. She looked back, still with a grin, “Come on”. I sighed and ran after her.
 
She ran to the apartment building’s fire escape, and I quickly followed. She climbed so fast I almost lost her. The heels of her shoes guiding me upwards until we reached the top. 

I heaved myself up onto the roof and looked up. She was stood on the opposite side with her hands out either side like a crucifix. The lights of the city lit her from below and reflected in her eyes when she turned to look at me. I slowly walked up next to her, and she dropped her arms. “This is the spot” she said with a finality. I put my foot onto the rim and stepped up next to her. We stood, staring at the lights bellow, for a long time. I wasn’t really paying attention to how long. Eventually she sat down and slung her legs over the edge, I did the same. 

“can I ask you a question?” she asked.

“Yeah, go ahead”. 

“Why are you gonna kill yourself?”.
We were silent. “Because I hate life and I don’t see how it’s gonna get better”. There was another long silence, broken when she asked, 

“What don’t you enjoy about life?” 

“I think…the pressure of now and the future really gets to me”, she nodded, “and…I don’t have anyone to help me through it”. 

“Is that everything?”

“Should there be more?”

“No, obviously not. Just making sure. Most people I know don’t know off the top of their heads what’s hurting them”

“I’ve just thought about it a lot”

“You’re very emotionally intelligent”

“Are you surprised”?

“A little, you never gave that vibe when I saw you around school”

 “Well, I’m different around friends”

“But you’re always the same at school” 

“Well,”, I chuckled, “I’ve got no friends”. She smiled gently, then silence again. After a little while she asked, “do have any family?”. With a sigh I responded “I have my mum…”

“but?”

“…But she’s not around much and we hardly talk”. 

“What about your father?” 

“He fucked off when was younger”

Another pause. “What about the pressure?”, she asked, ""The pressure of society"".

I sighed and responded “I don’t wanna grow up. I don’t want to have to get older, get a job, make money, get a house, the whole slog”. 

“Why not?”

“It seems pointless, why am I living life just to stay upright. We’re doing everything just so that we can stay out of poverty. I don’t want to”. 

“isn’t there anything you enjoy doing? Anything you could make a career out of?”

“No. Nothing I like can become a job, and I don’t want to do my hobbies for work, then they wouldn’t be hobbies”. 

“What do you like to do”. 

I hesitated. “Don’t laugh”

“I won’t”

“I…I write poetry sometimes”

“Poetry?” 

“Yeah”

“What kind”

“I don’t know. Just poems”

“Can you show me any”

“Well…”

“You don’t have to, I’m just interested”

“Alright, I have to find it”. I pulled out my phone and quickly pulled it up. I handed it to her but she refused. “I want you to read it to me. Gimme a dramatic reading”

“Do I have to?”

“Please”

“Fine” 

“Ok gimme a sec to get immersed”. She put her hands on her knees and closed her eyes. There was a pause. “Go on” 

“Ok…here goes…

The hands of the night closed in around me, constricting, blinding, suffocating. It’s dark cloak whipping in the breeze. It’s cold breath chilling my body and mind. The thump of its footsteps, my beating heart. 
I panted heavily, sweat dripping down my brow. I could feel the subtle poison of dark creeping into my vision. Twigs, fingers. Branches, arms. Trees, tall men in bowler hats. 
I pressed on, focusing on the consistent slap of my feet on the ground. My anchor to reality. Every so often the sounds of animals, those that seek refuge in gloom, would make me wheel around. I’d see nothing, but that gnawing feeling never left the pits of my stomach. 
I return to the comfort of light and the clarity therein. I seek the warmth of a hot drink, to burn the dread from within me. An occasional glance at the bleak sea would rekindle that anxiety and I would drown it out in the scolding boil of a brew. 
When this inevitably cannot dispel the loathsome ache, I turn to the comfort of ignorance. I shut my curtains, put on a charade of comfort and pray that dawns light can hasten to the brim of darkness”. 

I looked up. She still had her eyes closed and after a few seconds she opened them. “Is It done?”

“obviously”

 “Well, I wanted to be sure”

“What did you think?”

“I like it” 

“Is that all?”

“Do you want me to say more?” 

“I mean…yeah”.

“I don’t think I know enough about poems to do that”.

“Say what you can” 

“Uhhhh. It had words?”

“Nice” I said sarcastically,

""I dunno, I enjoyed it anyway, and the imagery was good”

“that’s something”

“Oh yeah…Go me”. We both laughed. 

“What about you? Your family, what do you wanna do?” I asked

“Well, I don’t have parents…”

“Oh…I’m sorry”

“No, no, don’t worry about it, I’ve never even met them” 

“Still…”

“It’s fine. Anyway…as for what I wanna do? I dunno”.
She stared into the stars, “I let someone I look up to down, and I really wanna make it up to them. I wanna prove that it was a mistake”. I wanted to ask more about this mystery person but before I could ask, she said, “but I also want to become famous”. 

This caught me off guard. “Famous, why?”

“I wanna have enough influence to help those that I want to. See people deserve second chances, and though many people share that sentiment, they forget that we also need to give second chances to those who haven’t done wrong. The homeless for instance, those who want to die, everyone deserves a second chance at a normal life, or at least another try”. 

I stared at her a little dumbfounded. “That’s so…noble, are you an angel or something” 

“Basically” she joked. 

There was another pause.
“I wouldn’t want to be famous. All those judging eyes?” I said

“But once you realise that no one cares, it’s fine”. 

“What do you mean?”. 

“Look” She stood up and cupped her hands around her mouth and took a deep breath. “Fuck! Shit! Piss! Cunt! Dick! Asshole! Sweaty fuckin’…bollocks!”. Her shouts travelled to the streets below and dissipated into echoes. 

She slumped back down and grinned at my shock, “see, no one cares, and if you don’t care then it doesn’t even matter”. 

“Yeah but…”, there was a buzz from her pocket, and she looked down. She pulled out a phone from seemingly nowhere and glanced at it. “I gotta go”. I felt my stomach sink a little. “Why?” 

“Got someone to meet”

“Oh”

she hopped onto the roof and began to walk away and stopped. She met my eyes, 

“if you decide to live, come to school and find me, yeah?”

“Yeah…”.

As she began to walk away I called after her, “Wait!”.
 
She turned back. 

“What’s your name?” I asked, 

“Az, and you?”

“Dylan”. 

She grinned, “I’ll see you round Dylan”, and then she was gone.

I sat on that roof for a long time before I decided to go. All the while debating what I really wanted. Whether intentional or not my feet wound their way back to the bridge. Its rusty white beams looked like bones in the moonlight. 

I knew what I was going to do now. 

No conflict in my mind,

and I was satisfied with my decision.

As soon I hit 19-20 my perspective of myself became uncomfortable, I didn't know what calorie deficit or a basic workout routine was. I knew if I didn't eat or have a small portion, along with a good activity I like it would bring some progress. And it did ! dude when I was seeing that number leaving was the best relief I've had in YEARS, later down the line it slowly grew into obsession. I needed more to drop, I had that ""I'll do anything mindset"" I started taking weight loss supplements and still continued my physical activity, yeah smoking will give ya muchies so i had my few shares. Continuing on with the alcohol issues, the less i eat the more i feel from the weed & alch. Month's past my main meal was a pot of coffee and my drugs, finally went to get a physical check up. My fam doctor was shock of the number, she said ive lost 300-230lbs so 70lbs. I was happy but empty, she ask how I did it and I was honest. She complimented me and said ""good job"", as if she didn't hear my alcohol issues, other drugs, and eating disorder basically. It broke me just to hear that from her, and I can't imagine how my friends & family would say too. My self image was desirable and my ego was high as shit, I deserved it after getting bullied for my weight growing up and finishing HS. But at the end it really tore apart of what I knew about myself, later going up to 25. I met someone that really does love for whom I am, and I'm blessed and grateful, yet that happiness came back with the weight and now I'm 275lb-280. Yeah.. fckin my fault, now I'm relearning of how to be happy with myself along with taking the RIGHT steps of loosing weight. Protine, fiber, ect and wrap that bih with a bow of physical activities. It's a challenge going back and forth, with myself of not slipping back into that slope of ED and drugs. Like I quit smoking, pills,and alcohol I'm scared to drink alot. Like I'm a change person now but not the weight. Look I'm not here for some sympathy, I'm here to get this shit of my chest. I just got off the phone with my bf, bro cracking jokes about my weight and where I'm at in life. Nah I didn't get all emotional nor defensive either, I'm stuck in a time loop. With my body being so use of carrying that uncessary weight It's sicking sometimes. I've often daydream, about ripping myself apart to a point just being skeleton. Finally having a moment to breathe and feel light, while pounds of fleash & fat scattered on the floor. Its becoming more real as I'm doing my physical activities, just  bleeding into my home life now. The obsessions feel so good, yet crushing my reality holding the weight now. Yo if you reading now, you a real one💯 and I appreciate you coming this far to my shitty confession. If you religious pray for ya boii, if not wish my big back good luck. I hope you can understand not all fat fcks, are just having a piece of cake every night or thinking about the next burger joint 🤣.

Yeah, I'm losing my edge.

Yeah, I’m losing my edge to Gen-z’ers who are basically wearing everything I wore in the late 90s that I never wanted to replicate. But I was there..

I was there when a show could consist of emo, pop-punk, hardcore, and metal band all in one bill in some steamy VFW hall with no ventilation.

I was there when your thrift shirt game had to be flawless and ironic because not every band or scene friend also had their own t-shirt line.   

I was there for the US Hellfest, Eulogy Fest, and whatever other fest that was just 20 bands playing 20 mins sets at some club for a Saturday matinee. 

Yeah I’m losing my edge, to the emo revival sad boy kids who just discovered American Football, Mineral, and Braid. 20 years later. 

But I was there…. 

I was there during the Saves The Day’s Stay What You Are tours, feeling cool that I knew the lyrics to the first two records and the acoustic EP.

I was there in the early 2000s when every copy cat New Found Glory rip off band would give a body part to get signed with Drive Thru, Vagrant, or Victory, and have those CD stickers that say… 

Do you like Britnney Spears meets Bon Jovi meets Joy Division? Then you’ll love this band!

But I’m losing my edge, to kids blending math rock, screams, emo rap and EDM. 

It’s 2003 and you’ve discovered The Postal Service and The Faint, so you're done playing guitar in a Vegan Straight Edge band to do indie dance pop. 

It’s 2008 and you are ditching that indie sleaze crap, to do a Beach Boys rip off band cause you just discovered Pet Sounds.

But I’m losing my edge to better looking people and better hair.

You say you are a cross between U2, the Gin Blossoms, and Blink-182, but all I see is a boyband with breakdowns. Thanks Finn Mckenty! How were you able to afford brand new telecasters and orange amps?

You say you're the biggest My Chemical Romance fan but you’ve never listened to the first record off Eyeball produced by the singer from Thursday. Jersey hardcore!     

Yeah, I’m losing my edge. Cause well standing up at a GA show for hours is starting to get uncomfortable well in into your 40s.     

I hear you have an extensive vinyl collection with everything from Discord, Bridge9, JadeTree,  the early Equal Vision years, Revelation, PolyVinyl and Saddle Creek.

I hear you never paid for a show in the last 20 years and someone always texts you the set times.  

But I’m losing my edge!!!

Hey buddy, the band is getting back together for some reunion shows. You should come out. It’s 18th anniversary of this record and the 23rd anniversary of this record, so we are playing them both in full!

But I’m losing my edge!

You know, I’m over touring in a van, relying on the Wendy’s value meal, working at a coffee shop when I’m not on tour and well making my own records. I should just right emo songs for Gen-z’ers in their 20s who have a much larger fan base and it will surely get me the bag. And no I don’t call that selling out, that’s being logical.     

Did you hear about that scene kid that converted his tapes to CDs to mp3s to now just a Spotify playlist of every emo/screamo/slowcore/crabcore/chugga chugga/pop-punk/melodic hardcore/straigh edge song from 1988 to 2008.

I deal with anxiety quiet often usually with external things like going to an exam venue, I fear I maybe at the wrong place. I also worry a lot about things just going wrong for some reason.

I have a routine but it isn't really concious. It is not like if I don't wake up a certain time or if I don't have my morning coffee, it'll be the end of the world but I am pretty consistent at it. However, I find it hard to maintain a new routine but if I stick to it for like a week-ish I will be pretty used to it until it gets broken.

I usually fear talking in a group because I just fear people wouldn't want to talk to me. I am also very very worried for my little brother when he goes out because he is like 9 and I fear someone would hurt him so I usually try my best to accompany him. I start worrying if my family doesn't come back home or they are late thinking they got into a car accident or something.

I also like guiding people to what they want in their lives, recommending them the best ways they could be in the future. I have a bad habit of making up stories when in a group which is usually to not feel inferior. I lie about basic things like residency, occupation and other stuff which other people wouldn't have a problem being truthful about.",1,1755803609.0,infp,0,1.0,False

1mwk93f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mwk93f/explore_the_blackdecker_12cup_programmable/,Explore the BLACK+DECKER 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker Review Is It Worth It?,"Testing coffee makers has become an everyday ritual in my life, and the BLACK+DECKER CM1110B 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker has certainly been a fascinating addition to the mix. From its intuitive programming features to its efficient brew system, this coffee machine promises plenty on paper. But, like anything else, there's a blend of positives and areas that could use improvement. Here’s my experience after a few weeks of daily brewing.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The design of this coffeemaker caught my eye immediately. It sports a clean appearance with a matte black finish, which fits perfectly with almost any modern kitchen aesthetic. It’s not overly large, measuring 8.15""D x 5""W x 12.11""H, so it doesn’t hog countertop space. At around 4.59 pounds, it feels lightweight but still sturdy enough not to slide around during use. The carafe, included with the machine, pours neatly without any annoying drips. On the downside, the build is entirely plastic, which doesn’t scream ""premium"" and might wear faster compared to machines made with more metallic elements.  

**Performance & Brew Quality**  
This drip coffee maker gets things right with its Vortex Technology, which ensures water saturates coffee grounds evenly. I tested this feature with various coffee brands and grounds, and the result was consistently rich and aromatic cups of coffee. The 12-cup capacity was perfect for my family gatherings, and for solo mornings, scaling down to smaller brews worked just as well. However, it’s worth mentioning that the ""12-cup"" size is based on 5 oz cups— something bigger mug users like me should keep in mind.  

***Check [BLACK+DECKER CM1110B 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker] price on Amazon.***  

**Features like Sneak-A-Cup™: A Game Changer**  
One feature I couldn’t stop using was the Sneak-A-Cup™ technology, which lets you snag a cup mid-brew without creating a mess. This is a lifesaver when I’m running late but still want my caffeine fix. However, it’s recommended to return the carafe within 30 seconds to prevent overflow—something I forgot once, leading to a bit of countertop cleanup. That’s on me, though!  

**Ease of Use & Programming Features**  
The QuickTouch™ Programming is as simple as it gets. Setting the time and scheduling the automatic brew for the next morning was straightforward, even for someone who’s technologically challenged like my mother. This feature alone has made my mornings so much smoother. However, I wish the buttons felt more tactile; they’re a bit too soft for my liking, leaving me questioning if my input registered on occasion.  

**Asset List**  
- The Vortex™ Technology enhances coffee extraction.  
- Sneak-A-Cup™ feature allows you to grab a cup mid-brew without spilling.  
- QuickTouch™ Programming makes scheduling brewing times a breeze.  

**Negatives**  
Although the coffeemaker has its merits, a closer look reveals a few areas for improvement.  

- Plastic construction might not withstand wear and tear as well as competitors’ models that incorporate stainless steel.  
- The digital buttons could feel more durable and responsive.  
- The “12-cup” measurement might be misleading for larger cup drinkers.  

**Rival Brands and Competitive Edge**  
There’s stiff competition in the world of programmable coffee machines. For instance, Hamilton Beach coffee makers in a similar price range often feature larger water reservoirs and stainless steel carafes. However, they don’t always match the flavor consistency achieved by the BLACK+DECKER’s Vortex Technology. On the opposite end, Mr. Coffee offers a great drip coffee series with a more premium feel but lacks the easy programming options that this device nails. While competitors are appealing, the programmable timer and Sneak-A-Cup™ feature stand out as winning touches in this device.   

**Bang for the Buck**  
Looking at the features, is this coffeemaker worth the price? I genuinely think it offers solid value for most kitchen countertops. It balances simplicity and performance effectively without being exorbitantly priced. That said, if long-term durability is your top concern, the heavy reliance on plastic might leave you considering pricier alternatives with sturdier builds.

Husband and I love the area. We're DINKs and like being able to walk to local places. The only pause for us is the elevated crime levels in the surrounding neighborhoods and even in Northside as well. It's hard to gauge what crime actually looks like in and near Northside without us living there and only stopping through once in a while for food/coffee, so we are taking stats and stuff we find with a grain of salt since most of those numbers are probably skewed anyways. Most of what I have seen others say on Reddit is that it's great and very community-oriented, but I haven't seen anything of late and was just curious what it's like today.

Guy at my gym class just asked me out for a coffee. Did not look at me the whole night but then he called and left a message. I never flirted with him AT All. However, I think, he is a decent guy. And it is really tough to make friends in this area. I know that he struggles, because he moved here from the city just as I did. Wouldn‘t mind a friendship, I also do not know have many friends here. But I have zero male friends.Do not know how to make that work. 
I thought, he understood, I was gay when we chatted a while ago or that he noticed the raimbow keyholder… but well, obviously not.
What do I say?
Just: Sorry, not interested?
Sending a picture of the keyholder? And a laughing smiley ? 
It would have been so much easier had he asked me in person.
I don‘t believe this. 
I guess, offering a frindship does not lead to anything, does it?

1mwk34a,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mwk34a/a_late_night_talk/,A Late Night Talk,"‘I can’t sleep’. When asked what was wrong that was the easiest answer. I found it satiated most people when they asked. It was quick, to the point and didn’t involve delving into the inner depths of my psyche. It wasn’t a lie, I couldn’t sleep, but it wasn’t the full truth either. Every night I would lie in bed for hours, staring at the ceiling. I know each bump and imperfection in the peeling plaster to almost perfection; I’ve spent countless boring hours counting the specs of dirt and grime, trying to fall asleep. Then one day I gave up on trying. 
I’ve taken to walking around at night, my mother doesn’t notice or care so I can slip out easily. The city remained cold and empty, so long as you keep off the main street, and there was a catharsis in the silence that came with solitude. There was a small coffee shop that other nighttime lurkers and I were frequent patrons of. It was the only one that stayed open late enough. The young woman that was often behind the counter had stopped asking why ‘a young man like me was up so late’. I doubted that she believed the excuses I made every time, but she never pressed. 
Today I’d decided not to get a coffee. It was a detour from the path, and detours would let me question things. I was walking down a dimly lit cobbled street, rubbing my hands together to keep warm. Incremental light fixtures cut harshly into the night with their yellow beams. A man swathed in a blanket was fast asleep against a wall, legs tucked up so that he was just out of the light. I wondered if he’d done that intentionally. I reached the entrance to an alleyway that cut across to the riverside. It was that way that I was headed. All the shops down this stretch of street were dark except one, it’s bright lights bled into the dim of the street like an oil spillage. I found myself almost shrinking away from it as I passed. The stark white lights of the corner shop did not belong in this world. A world of dark, loneliness and the glint of cat’s eyes.
When I reached the river, I stopped for a second and lent on the guardrails. The inky black water seemed to stretch on forever. It disappeared over the horizon and into the ocean. The nearby boats looked like shadowy beasts in the gloom. The wind ruffled my hair as I stared into the depths. I used to walk past this spot on my way to school. It had been a place of comfort, until the other kids threw my school bag into the water. I’ve been without one ever since. My grip tightened on the rail. 
The bridge was a cold web of peeling iron. The white paint had been tainted by time and now was now a foul beige. A cars headlights lit up the road blinding me momentarily, a rare sight. The car slid by and disappeared into the night. A local tale of a couple committing suicide on this bridge made it wildly unpopular. The tail went that they had lost their first child, and the grief had been too much. Part of me hated to taint its reputation more but I had decided this would be the place. It had to be here, maybe my brain was trying to exert a little control before the end. 
I placed my hand on the rail and hoisted myself up. I shifted over so that I was sitting with my legs hanging over the edge. It looked a lot further from here. I felt a small bubble of fear well in my stomach pushed it down. This was what I wanted. I knew. I stood and the wind blew a little harder, as if trying to push me back from the edge. 
No.
This is what I want.
I closed my eyes and took a deep breath…
“It’s cold, isn’t it?”. I jumped in fright and almost slipped off into the water. My eyes darted back, that fear returning once again, but it was accompanied by an emotion I couldn’t place. Standing, back leant up against the rail and head rolled back so that she was staring at me, was a girl. She looked around my age, maybe a bit older, with a round face and deep blue eyes. Her hair was cut short so that it curled around her ears and there was a single purple strand that was a little longer than the others. “wha-who?”. Why didn’t I hear her before? She ignored my stammering, “Yo” she said with a hint of irony, “I don’t think we’ve talked before, but I’ve seen you around. You stopped coming in to school, right?”. I didn’t speak for a second, struggling to think what to say. “I-I-uhh…yeah. Yeah, I did. Do…I know you?”. 
“I just told you, we’ve never spoken”. 
“R-right”. I didn’t recognise her at all. “Which class are you in?” I asked. 
“My form room is just next to yours”.  
“Room 3?” 
“yeah”. Why was this conversation so casual, surely, she could see what he was trying to do? There was a pause. “Are you going to try to stop me? Cus I won’t. I’ve made up my mind”.
 She turned so that her whole body was facing me. “I wasn’t gonna, no” 
“Well then what…”
“I wanna talk” 
“What?”
“I wanna talk to you”
“Well...”, this was so bizarre. “Well, I…what?”. 
“Nothing specific, I just wanna talk”. I stared at her. “Here?” I asked. “Nah” she held out a hand to help me down “Let’s Walk and talk”. I didn’t move. “Come on, you may as well, it won’t take too long”. There was a short pause, “we have all night”. 
We began walking side by side. Neither of us spoke for a long while but I kept steeling glances at her. She was walking with one hand in her pocket and the other fell semi-loose at her side, swinging slightly. Her lips were curved in a constant small smile, as if just breathing brought her joy. She caught my eye during one of my glances and I quickly turned back to face forward, cheeks slightly red. 
A few more minutes passed, and I realised that we were one turn away from the main road. I cleared my throat, “I don’t wanna walk this way”. She looked at me and cocked her head slightly “Why?”. 
“I don’t wanna go on the main street, It’s too…much”. She nodded, “We can go a different way, uhhhh this way, I know a spot”. She turned down a small alley to our left and I followed. “You know the city quite well then?” she asked. “yeah”, it was a lame reply, but I didn’t know what to say. “How come?”. I hesitated as I thought how to respond “I come out at night a lot”.
“Really? Why”  
“Well why are you out” I mumbled in response. “touché” she grinned “I wasn’t judging, I just wanted to know what attracted you to it”. 
“it’s quiet…well…most of the time, and it’s better than lying in bed all night”. 
“what’s keeping you up” 
“I don’t know” I lied. 
“I’ve heard some people say that it can be to do with finding satisfaction in your day. Did your days stop being satisfying?”
“What are you, my therapist?” I jabbed. 
“Sorry, Sorry. I have a habit of doing that”
“What? Being nosey?”
“No…well, yes, but it’s more just asking questions. It drives a lot of people up the wall and sometimes my curiosity can get the better of me. It really can piss people off”. 
She glanced up at the sky as she said this and then looked back to me. “Sorry for digging”. I hesitated for a second then replied “It’s ok. I just…you’re right, my days aren’t satisfying. They haven’t been for a long time”. There was a silence for another minute. I felt a lot more relaxed than I had. Being with her didn’t seem as daunting as being with other people. “Can I ask you a question?” I asked.
“Hit me”
“Do you go out at night a lot?” 
“Yeah”
“Can I ask why?”
“Because the night is beautiful”
“Is that all?”
“Do I need to have more of a reason?”. I thought about it, “no. No you don’t”. She stopped and looked up, “You know some people say that the night sky, the stars, are like a window to heaven. Each one a different angel. Look at them”, 
I did, 
“Each one shining down on us, each its own life” she looked back to me, “You get me?”
“You’re not who I expected you to be”.
 She grinned, looking very satisfied “good, I like surprising people”
While we were talking, we’d walked down that alley and come out onto a street, she’d led me down, away from the city centre, until we reached the side of a tall apartment complex. She tapped my shoulder “We’re here”. 
“where’s here-Hey wait!”, she had started to run down the little alley next to the building. She looked back, still with a grin, “Come on”. I sighed and ran after her. 
She ran to the apartment building’s fire escape, and I quickly followed. She climbed so fast I almost lost her. The heels of her shoes guiding me upwards until we reached the top. I heaved myself up onto the roof and looked up. She was stood on the opposite side with her hands out either side like a crucifix. The lights of the city lit her from below and reflected in her eyes when she turned to look at me. I slowly walked up next to her, and she dropped her arms. “This is the spot” she said with a finality. I put my foot onto the rim and stepped up next to her. We stood, staring at the lights bellow, for a long time. I wasn’t really paying attention to how long. Eventually she sat down and slung her legs over the edge, I did the same. 
“can I ask you a question?” she asked.
“Yeah, go ahead”. 
“Why are you gonna kill yourself?”. We were silent. “Because I hate life and I don’t see how it’s gonna get better”. There was another long silence, broken when she asked, “What don’t you enjoy about life?” 
“I think…the pressure of now and the future really gets to me”, she nodded, “and…I don’t have anyone to help me through it”. 
“Is that everything?”
“Should there be more?”
“No, obviously not. Just making sure. Most people I know don’t know off the top of their heads what’s hurting them”
“I’ve just thought about it a lot”
“You’re very emotionally intelligent”
“Are you surprised”?
“A little, you never gave that vibe when I saw you around school”
 “Well, I’m different around friends”
“But you’re always the same at school” 
“Well,”, I chuckled, “I’ve got no friends”. She smiled gently, then silence again. After a little while she asked, “do have any family?”. With a sigh I responded “I have my mum…”
“but?”
“…But she’s not around much and we hardly talk”. 
“What about your father?” 
“He fucked off when was younger”
Another pause. “What about the pressure?”, she asked
I sighed and responded “I don’t wanna grow up. I don’t want to have to get older, get a job, make money, get a house, the whole slog”. 
“Why not?”
“It seems pointless, why am I living life just to stay upright. We’re doing everything just so that we can stay out of poverty. I don’t want to”. 
“isn’t there anything you enjoy doing? Anything you could make a career out of?”
“No. Nothing I like can become a job, and I don’t want to do my hobbies for work, then they wouldn’t be hobbies”. 
“What do you like to do”. 
I hesitated. “Don’t laugh”
“I won’t”
“I…I write poetry sometimes”
“Poetry?” 
“Yeah”
“What kind”
“I don’t know. Just poems”
“Can you show me any”
“Well…”
“You don’t have to, I’m just interested”
“Alright, I have to find it”. I pulled out my phone and quickly pulled it up. I handed it to her but she refused. “I want you to read it to me. Gimme a dramatic reading”
“Do I have to?”
“Please”
“Fine” 
“Ok gimme a sec to get immersed”. She put her hands on her knees and closed her eyes. There was a pause. “Go on” 
“Ok…here goes…The hands of the night closed in around me, constricting, blinding, suffocating. It’s dark cloak whipping in the breeze. It’s cold breath chilling my body and mind. The thump of its footsteps, my beating heart. 
I panted heavily, sweat dripping down my brow. I could feel the subtle poison of dark creeping into my vision. Twigs, fingers. Branches, arms. Trees, tall men in bowler hats. 
I pressed on, focusing on the consistent slap of my feet on the ground. My anchor to reality. Every so often the sounds of animals, those that seek refuge in gloom, would make me wheel around. I’d see nothing, but that gnawing feeling never left the pits of my stomach. 
I return to the comfort of light and the clarity therein. I seek the warmth of a hot drink, to burn the dread from within me. An occasional glance at the bleak sea would rekindle that anxiety and I would drown it out in the scolding boil of a brew. 
When this inevitably cannot dispel the loathsome ache, I turn to the comfort of ignorance. I shut my curtains, put on a charade of comfort and pray that dawns light can hasten to the brim of darkness”. 
I looked up. She still had her eyes closed and after a few seconds she opened them. “Is It done?”
“obviously”
 “Well, I wanted to be sure”
“What did you think?”
“I like it” 
“Is that all?”
“Do you want me to say more?” 
“I mean…yeah”.
“I don’t think I know enough about poems to do that”.
“Say what you can” 
“Uhhhh. It had words?”
“Nice” I said sarcastically,
 “I dunno, I enjoyed it anyway, and the imagery was good”
“that’s something”
“Oh yeah…Go me”. We both laughed. 
“What about you? Your family, what do you wanna do?” I asked
“Well, I don’t have parents…”
“Oh…I’m sorry”
“No, no, don’t worry about it, I’ve never even met them” 
“Still…”
“It’s fine. Anyway…as for what I wanna do? I dunno”.
She stared into the stars, “I let someone I look up to down, and I really wanna make it up to them. I wanna prove that it was a mistake”. I wanted to ask more about this mystery person but before I could ask, she said, “but I also want to become famous”. This caught me off guard. “Famous, why?”
“I wanna have enough influence to help those that I want to. See people deserve second chances, and though many people share that sentiment, they forget that we also need to give second chances to those who haven’t done wrong. The homeless for instance, those who want to die, everyone deserves a second chance at a normal life, or at least another try”. I stared at her a little dumbfounded. “That’s so…noble, are you an angel or something” 
“Basically” she joked. There was another pause.
“I wouldn’t want to be famous. All those judging eyes?” I said
“But once you realise that no one cares, it’s fine”. 
“What do you mean?”. 
“Look” She stood up and cupped her hands around her mouth and took a deep breath. “Fuck! Shit! Piss! Cunt! Dick! Asshole! Sweaty fuckin’…bollocks!”. Her shouts travelled to the streets below and dissipated into echoes. She slumped back down and grinned at my shock, “see, no one cares, and if you don’t care then it doesn’t even matter”. 
“Yeah but…”, there was a buzz from her pocket, and she looked down. She pulled out a phone from seemingly nowhere and glanced at it. “I gotta go”. I felt my stomach sink a little. “Why?” 
“Got someone to meet”
“Oh”
she hopped onto the roof and began to walk away and stopped. She met my eyes, “if you decide to live, come to school and find me, yeah?”
“Yeah…”.
 As she began to walk away I called after her, “Wait!”. She turned back. 
“What’s your name?” I asked, 
“Az, and you?”
“Dylan”. She grinned, “I’ll see you round Dylan”, and then she was gone.
I sat on that roof for a long time before I decided to go. All the while debating what I really wanted. Whether intentional or not my feet wound their way back to the bridge. Its rusty white beams looked like bones in the moonlight. 
I knew what I was going to do now. 
No conflict in my mind,
and I was satisfied with my decision.

I deal with anxiety quiet often usually with external things like going to an exam venue, I fear I maybe at the wrong place. I also worry a lot about things just going wrong for some reason. 

I have a routine but it isn't really concious. It is not like if I don't wake up a certain time or if I don't have my morning coffee, it'll be the end of the world but I am pretty consistent at it. However, I find it hard to maintain a new routine but if I stick to it for like a week-ish I will be pretty used to it until it gets broken.

I usually fear talking in a group because I just fear people wouldn't want to talk to me. I am also very very worried for my little brother when he goes out because he is like 9 and I fear someone would hurt him so I usually try my best to accompany him. I start worrying if my family doesn't come back home or they are late thinking they got into a car accident or something.

I also like guiding people to what they want in their lives, recommending them the best ways they could be in the future. I have a bad habit of making up stories when in a group which is usually to not feel inferior. I lie about basic things like residency, occupation and other stuff which other people wouldn't have a problem being truthful about.",1,1755803072.0,MbtiTypeMe,2,1.0,False

It ended horriblly after a number of large verbal fights. And eventually led to my mental breakdown, during the first stages of the break up she would consistently send call and video chat requests to me. 
Not to talk rationally but to continue arguing, dispite her knowing I was in a mental crisis. 

It took me years to recover but I havent been in a full timer relationship since, deep down im scared of repeating the trauma. 

Anyways, 2 weeks ago we matched on tinder (she has been abroad since we separated). I reached out first to wish her all the best and to suggest a coffee meet to catch up.

This has brought up so many memories of out relationship, and for the first time in years im longing for again. 

Ive reflected on this a lot the last 2 weeks, and now realise that im actually longing for companionship and a partner not specifically her. I think my mind automatically pictures her as a default partner when im lonely. 

To make things worse, im on a journey of quiting weed after 15 years 10 of which was daily use. Currently on day 51 💪

An Expert’s Real-World Guide for Bahrain Company Formation in 2025\
\
From a Coffee in Bahrain Bay to the Heart of Business\
I still remember the aroma of cardamom coffee swirling through the air in a seventh-floor meeting room overlooking the Diplomatic Area. It was April, Ramadan hours in full effect. My Bahraini business partner insisted—“You haven’t truly started a business in Manama until you’ve sipped coffee with a client above the Bahrain Financial Harbour.” I’d arrived early, passing through the crisp, glass-walled lobby, only to realize half the building’s tenants were already deep into morning majlis gatherings. That’s business in Bahrain: modern infrastructure, centuries-old customs, and an almost obsessive focus on seamless payments.\
My reason for being there? To solve an urgent challenge: integrating digital payments for a new fintech startup in Seef District just days before the updated 2025 requirements went live. I learned more in that frantic week than in years of consulting across the Gulf.\
\
\
Alt text: Business people in a professional meeting, discussing corporate strategies.), mobile payments, and e-invoicing. Even traditional traders in the Manama Souq now sport QR code payment stickers beside their brass scales.\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain business district skyline., all businesses holding a valid Commercial Registration (CR) via Sijilat must:\
\
Offer at least one approved digital payment method at all points of sale (physical and online).\
Connect to the national BENEFIT payment gateway or an approved international payment service provider.\
Display QR codes or NFC terminals prominently for customer use.\
Issue digital receipts and maintain electronic sales records for government audit and VAT compliance.\
\
Failure to comply can result in fines from BHD 500 to BHD 1,500 per outlet, temporary CR suspension, and restricted access to LMRA work permit renewals.\
(Personal aside: During my own CR renewal in February 2025, the MOICT helpdesk insisted on a live demo of our e-payment terminal before processing. The process, if you’re prepared, takes 15 minutes. If not, you’ll be sent to the back of the queue—twice, in my case, before the team at Seef MOICT hinted at the right bank officer to expedite documentation.)\
What Payment Methods Are Required?\
The approved digital payment channels in Bahrain include:\
\
BENEFITPay (National e-wallet; mandatory for retail/restaurant/consumer-facing businesses)\
Credit/debit card POS terminals (Must be integrated with Bahrain’s BENEFIT network)\
Secure online payment gateways (e.g., PayTabs, HyperPay, Checkout.com, for e-commerce and hybrid businesses)\
QR code and NFC tap-to-pay options (increasingly standard across retail and service sectors)\
\
Service-based or B2B businesses (consultancies, IT firms, etc.) must enable at least one of the following:\
\
Bank transfer via BENEFIT platform\
Online invoicing with built-in digital payment links\
\
Wholesale/trade companies operating in Bahrain Bay or Diplomatic Area often prefer multi-currency settlement via online platforms, a trend now officially sanctioned by the Central Bank.\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration, professional team meeting in a corporate office.:\
  All are subject to the full payment integration mandates. Full details at Bahrain business type structures.\
- SPCs, WLLs, and Foreign Branches:\
  Equally bound by digital payment rules regardless of market segment.\
- 100% Foreign-Owned Entities:\
  The same rules apply—see foreigner-friendly activities & ownership and 99% foreign ownership in Bahrain.\
- Commercial Agencies and Free Zone Firms:\
  Must follow all requirements unless 100% of business occurs outside Bahrain’s physical borders (Bahrain free zones).\
- Professional Service or Freelance Activities:**\
  Even individual consultants must now offer digital payment acceptance for all commercial transactions above BHD 100 per invoice.\
Exemptions and Special Cases\
\
Cash-only micro-vendors (less than BHD 1,000 monthly turnover) may apply for conditional waivers via MOICT, but these are rarely granted after 2025.\
Religious, charitable, or non-profit entities have a separate regulatory process, but digital receipt-keeping is still mandatory.\
\
\
Step-by-Step Guide: How To Meet Bahrain’s Digital Payment Rules\
1. Prepare Commercial Registration (CR) Documentation\
\
Have all shareholder and director IDs, lease agreements, and activity lists ready (see process guide).\
Pre-select your preferred digital payment provider—gather their technical integration documents early.\
\
2. Apply for Digital Payment Integration\
\
BENEFITPay (mandatory for most retail):\
  Visit your business bank branch (best: Seef or Diplomatic Area to avoid lines), request the digital payment terminal form, and coordinate with BENEFIT’s onboarding team.\
POS Terminal Providers:\
  Largest banks (NBB, BBK, Al Salam) now offer same-day activation if your documentation is complete. Arrange for morning appointments outside peak majlis hours (10:00–11:00am or 2:00–4:00pm are best).\
Online Gateways:\
  For e-commerce, apply via your local bank or licensed fintech (PayTabs, Tap Payments). Provide your CR, VAT certificate, and site security certificate.\
\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation, two businessmen discussing office paperwork.\
- Don’t forget Ramadan: office hours change, and government offices close early. Schedule all critical submissions before 1pm during this period.\
3. Install and Test Terminals\
\
Ensure hardware is branded with your trading name, not your personal name (common mistake).\
Run a live transaction in front of your bank’s branch officer or MOICT desk. Keep a photo of the successful transaction for your records—this can save you from return trips.\
\
4. Update Your Sijilat Registration\
\
After installing your terminal/gateway, log in to Sijilat and upload the compliance certificate or payment provider’s confirmation.\
Download the official compliance stamp issued by MOICT.\
\
5. Train Your Team\
\
Front-line staff must be able to show digital receipt generation and QR usage. (I ran a “mock customer” drill before my last regulatory inspection—passed without a hitch.)\
\
\
Cost Considerations: Fees, Hardware, and Budgeting\
Digital payment implementation in Bahrain is not overly expensive compared to major GCC neighbors.\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs, calculator and money for business budgeting.\
  * Monthly service fee: BHD 10–25\
  * Transaction fees: 0.8%–2.0% per swipe\
- Online Payment Gateways:\
  * Set-up: Free–BHD 100 (most banks waive this for new CRs)\
  * Per-transaction fee: 1.9%–3.2% (dependent on provider/volume)\
- Integration with Accounting Software:\
  * Cloud subscriptions: BHD 5–35/month (see accounting services)\
- Compliance Certification/Document Prep:\
  * DIY: Free\
  * Professional services: BHD 150–300\
See up-to-date cost breakdowns at Bahrain company formation cost.\
Insider Hacks to Save Time and Money\
\
Combine your bank onboarding and terminal application in a single visit—bring extra copies of all CR and lease docs.\
Request a mobile POS device if your business is mobile (e.g., home delivery, pop-up retail)—they’re faster to deploy and often cheaper.\
Apply for Tamkeen subsidies if your business employs five or more local Bahrainis; Tamkeen may cover up to 75% of your hardware and training costs.\
\
\
Legal Compliance: Audits, Documentation, and Enforcement\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, business partners signing contract paperwork..\
Required:\
\
Digital transaction logs (minimum 3 years’ retention)\
On-demand digital receipt printing\
Proof of compliant payment hardware/software\
Evidence of staff training\
\
Mistake alert: Many newcomers forget to update Sijilat with their digital payment certification. This oversight can freeze your ability to renew your CR—never assume the bank updates Sijilat automatically. Always upload your compliance docs yourself.\
Frequent audits focus on sectors with high cash turnover—restaurants, corner shops, service kiosks. I once faced a panic in Seef when an inspector found our QR sticker faded from sunlight; a quick WhatsApp to our payment provider had a replacement couriered within two hours, crisis averted.\
For more on staying compliant, consult accounting and bookkeeping services.\
\
Pro Tips: Avoiding Common Pitfalls\
\
Don’t rely on verbal assurances—always request written compliance confirmation from your provider.\
Update your software after any regulatory change (new CBB rules often require a quick firmware flash).\
Rotate payment hardware as needed; Bahrain’s climate is tough on electronics.\
Network often: Local compliance officers offer valuable hints at majlis events—free advice is everywhere, if you ask the right way.\
\
\
Why Bahrain Wins: A Quick Comparison\
Compared to the UAE, where digital payment approval can drag on for weeks, Bahrain’s one-window Sijilat system is smoother. Saudi Arabia’s requirements are more complex for foreign-owned businesses. Bahrain? No-nonsense, fast, and transparent. Plus, you’ll find local customs—majlis-style networking, coffee rituals, and a genuine eagerness to help outsiders—make the process less intimidating for newcomers.\
\
Real-World Tangent: The Power of Bahrain’s Free Zones\
You might wonder—do these rules apply in Bahrain’s free zones? Absolutely, if you transact inside the Kingdom. But, in free zones like Bahrain Logistics Zone, you can actually gain access to preferred payment rates and faster onboarding. One of my clients recently slashed setup time by 40% simply by starting in a free zone first, then expanding to a Seef retail outlet.\

I’m a 24-year-old from Wisconsin and I’ll be finishing up my Associate’s in Cybersecurity next summer. I’m strongly considering transferring to Oregon State University (OSU) to complete my Bachelor’s (likely in Cybersecurity or Computer Science with a security focus), and I’ll be 25 by the time I’d start at OSU.

I’m really drawn to the PNW vibe coast, mountains, forests and I’ve heard Corvallis has a good balance of outdoorsy lifestyle and college-town energy. Since I’ll be a bit older than the typical undergrad, I’ve got a few questions for current or recent OSU students (especially transfers or “non-traditional” students).

**Housing:** What’s the best setup for someone my age? Do many transfer students live on campus, or is it more common to go straight into apartments around Corvallis? Are there specific neighborhoods or complexes that tend to be better for mid-20s students (a little quieter, but still social)? Anything I should avoid?

**Social Life / Nightlife:** I’ve heard OSU has a mix some Greek life/party culture, but also lots of breweries, coffee shops, concerts, and outdoors stuff. For someone in their mid-20s, how easy is it to find people who are more into hiking, live music, and laid-back nights than frat parties?

**Age Demographics:** Since OSU is a bigger school, is there a noticeable community of transfers and older students, or do you mostly end up surrounded by 19-20 year olds in upper-division classes?

**Being “Looked At Differently”:** Do professors or classmates treat you any differently if you’re a little older? I’m serious about my studies (I want to work in cybersecurity long-term), but I’d also like to have a solid social life without feeling like the “old guy in class.”

**General Transfer Vibe:** For those who came in with an associate’s, how smooth was the transition to OSU? Did you feel welcomed into the community, or was it tough to break into friend groups?

In a 4-3-1-1-1 vote, Ezekiel is eliminated, while Mal wins immunity in a 3-3-2-1 vote. 

After the challenge, Mal and Justin are talking about who to eliminate. The latter suggests Bridgette, to break her and Eva up, but Mal angrily states that Ezekiel is getting the boot, because of what he did in the challenge, and it’d be an easier sell to Cody. 

Speaking of Zeke, he’s gathered Eva, Shawn, and Bridgette so they can agree on who to vote for. Ezekiel pleads with them to vote out Mike, saying he’s not at all what he seems like, and is evil. Bridgette is skeptical of Ezekiel’s claim, and Shawn more so, as the two are friends. Eva is willing to vote Mike, but Zeke figures something out, and says that they can vote for Justin. 

At the campfire ceremony, Chris quickly hands out marshmallows to Mal, Cody, Shawn, and Bridgette. Zeke and Justin are the last contestants without a marshmallow, with Justin profusely sweating, while Ezekiel has a solemn and accepting look. The last marshmallow goes to Justin, who is very much relieved. Eva is ready to throttle someone before Ezekiel asks for time to explain everything. When Chris tries to stop this, Eva pushes him off the ledge, rolling him down the steep hill. She then gives an angry look at Chef, and the cook backs off. 

Firstly, Ezekiel apologizes to Cody, telling him that the reason he voted for Sammy was out of fear of Mal revealing a secret to Eva, with Ezekiel saying that Mike isn’t in control anymore, it’s Mal, who will stop at nothing to win the million dollars. Everybody looks at him, and Mal reveals himself, saying that he was almost surprised it took so long for them to notice. Cody decides to forgive Zeke, and the duo hug it out, before Zeke goes up to Eva. 

Then, Ezekiel goes up to Eva, telling her that on the first day, he had said that his team lost because they had more girls, with Beth in particular screwing up. He then says that this show, and Eva in particular, have helped him to truly see girls as his equals, and people who can be strong, just like himself. Zeke then tells Eva that she has been an absolute joy to be around, and says that he really likes her, but understands if she doesn’t reciprocate the feelings, especially after he admitted to his once sexist beliefs. Eva simply responds by picking him up and kissing him on the lips, eliciting an aww from Bridgette. 

Chef then puts Ezekiel into the cannon, and shoots the homeschooled boy into the night. Chris then makes it back to the elimination area, and as he signs off, the entire island goes nuts, with snow blowing everywhere, trees and bushes moving underground, and the Max Clones escaping containment, scurrying across the island. As Chris is trying to figure out what to do, the screen fades to black. 

In-Universe Votes 

Votes for Ezekiel: Cody, Mal, Justin, Ezekiel 

Votes for Justin: Bridgette, Shawn, Eva 

Total Drama: The (Max) Clone Wars 

The episode starts where we left off last time, with Chris on the phone, talking to the producers. When he hangs up, he sees the unamused faces of the campers, and tries to pass off the whole ordeal as completely normal. Multiple trees are seen retracting underground, with a Christmas tree popping up in one of it’s places, eventually forcing Chris to admit the truth: Pahkitew Island is robotic. Everyone besides Justin is shocked at the revelation, and a robotic voice is heard, saying that the island will self-destruct in one hour. Chris then says that the final six will split up into teams of two, and that whoever shuts off the self destruct wins invincibility. Chris then climbs into a red helicopter piloted by Chef, and Shawn asks why everybody can’t get in, to which Chris ignores, and Chef flies away. 

The final six split into duos, with the first duo being Mal and Justin, next being Eva and Bridgette, and finally, Cody and Shawn. The middle duo find quite the litany of obstacles in their way, including rising rocks, trees, and even a Max clone, which Eva punches away after it tries to grapple onto Bridgette. They eventually reach a lake, which they dive into after Bridgette sees a metal door openable by a wheel.  

While Eva and Bridgette are pulling on the wheel to get it to budge, Fang of all sharks manages to show up, tapping on Bridgette’s shoulder, showing off all of his teeth. Bridgette makes noises of fear, and Eva punches the shark in the nose, initially making him go away, but he swims right back, twice as angry. As the shark is about to attack the girls, he smells a yellow liquid, making him gag and swim in the completely opposite direction. Bridgette is seen blushing, and says in the confessional that others would’ve done the same thing had a mutated shark descended on them.  

The camera cuts to Mal and Justin, who are trying to find a way to get into the island. The camera then zooms into Mal’s head, showing Mike and Chester’s “journey” through their brain, trying to find the others. Mike says that while it sucks that they have a good chance of dying on the explosive island, this is the perfect time to find everyone else, when Mal is distracted. Chester voices his agreement, saying that the quicker they find everyone, the less likely his hips give out, which Mike chuckles at. 

 As they walk, we see another flashback to a younger Mike, who is watching a movie on the TV that seemed to be Indiana Jones, seeming quite engaged by the film. Another flashback shows a slightly older Mike at school, seemingly in gym class. The two options for gym that day were gymnastics and football, but they could hardly be considered choices, as they boys were pushed to play football, while the girls did the gymnastics. The gym teacher asks why Mike isn’t playing football, and he says that he simply prefers gymnastics, to which the teacher says “wrong!” to, reporting him to the office. Mike’s biological father hears about this, along with other “offenses” from other teachers, and his father forcibly grabs him by the wrist, dragging him out of the school. 

Mike simply shudders at the memories, saying that the Indiana Jones movies were one of the few good things he had in his life, creating Manitoba, who was broadly similar to the titular action hero. And with Svetlana, Mike was locked in his room for nearly a week for daring to be “feminine”, with only a minimal amount of water given to him to keep him alive. Mike finds Svetlana making skulls out of butter, and they’re able to convince her to tag along. They also find Manitoba, who is making skateboards, and they try to get him to come along, also accepting the challenge of taking down Mal. 

Back with Mal and Justin, they find many holes in the ground, with trees popping in and out of them. They see one open hole in particular, and jump simultaneously, but the pair of antagonists get stuck. Back with Eva and Bridgette, they are walking through the halls when Chris announces some “good news”, in that Chris has enough footage to cut together an episode. Eva sarcastically thanks Chris, and as Bridgette walks, an alarm goes off, dumbfounding the surfer. Chris is howling, saying that he loved the choice of buying infrared lasers, just so things like this could happen. Bridgette is freaked out, and Eva is incredulous. 

And with Shawn and Cody, they’ve ended up in an area with a bunch of rocks. While Shawn is looking around for any places to get underground, Cody, in his frustration of the past few days, kicks a rock, revealing an entrance in which Shawn and Cody enter through. They slide through the chute and end up in a room. A mechanical whirring noise is heard, and several Chris McLean bots descend on them, eyes glowing red. The duo grabs each other in fear, and Chris motions for a commercial break, telling Chef to fix the coffee machine as well. 

When they come back, Shawn and Cody are still gripping each other, but Shawn gets a sudden rush of adrenaline, proceeding to headbutt all the Chris bots, leaving them in a destroyed heap. Cody says that what Shawn just did was awesome, high fiving the zombie obsessed boy. 

Back with Mal and Justin, they’re now underground, and Chris notifies them of Bridgette setting off the security measures underground, releasing the dangerous animals considered too deadly to host above ground. A seemingly innocent cat walks through a nearby door, and Justin is about to pet said cat, but it starts breathing fire, barely missing Justin’s hair, freaking the model out. Chris says that they can either stick with the cat bot, or head through another door towards the gear chamber, which they reluctantly accept. In the chamber, the duo is doing some serious work to dodge the gears, nearly getting scraped several times. 

Eva and Bridgette are currently being chased by Scuba Bear, showing no signs of stopping. The duo reaches the end of the corridor, and hear pounding on a nearby door, which they open, releasing Cody and Shawn. A rumbling from the ceiling is heard, and Mal and Justin tumble out to the floor. Scuba Bear has almost reached them, and Chris says that they’ve found the control room, which requires a password to open, which he stuck in the control room for safekeeping. Bridgette frantically tries a code, but gets electrocuted for being wrong, giving Cody an idea.  

Scuba Bear has just reached the contestants, and Cody tells everyone besides Shawn to hold down Scuba Bear, while Shawn forces the bear’s hand onto the control panel. With some struggle, this happens, and Scuba Bear overloads the panel, opening the control room, and blowing up Scuba Bear’s head. While everyone else is gawking at the severed bear’s head, Mal quickly hops into the control room, trying to shut the self-destruct off. Justin suggests using Ctrl+Alt+Delete, and this somehow works, shutting off the self-destruct with 10 seconds to spare. 

Chris appears on the screen in the control room and is surprised to find out that they didn’t die. Chris declares Mal the winner of invincibility, and as such, cannot be voted for tonight, getting four pained groans. A Max clone then somehow bursts through the ceiling of the control room, wreaking havoc on all of the controls. One side of Pahkitew Island bursts into flames, while the other side becomes encased in ice.

I was the new girl in that specific location but been working for these people for 13years. I knew everything about everything and was promised the store management position after I started training for it. Basically I was getting paid minimum wage during that training but It was fine with me since it was for a few weeks only. I eventually learned by a coworker that she was the one taking the management position because she was there for longer than me (only 4 years overall but she was at that specific restaurant longer than me...anyways)... They said they were sorry and shipped me to another of their restaurant for a cashier position at minimum wage. I was raging inside. 
Here's the funny twist... they have an online training system for all their restaurants that I was granted full access to when in training... like FULL ON admin access. People cant work their shift if their online training is not finished (its getting paid, fortunately). I found out after I rejected their cashier position and quit that I still have that access. Since they couldnt know it was me (they created very specific and easy to know (and guess) passwords for everybody), I deleted everything. From every restaurant. Thousand of hours of employees training. Even all the higher management team's account. E.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G. Everone had to start everything over ( while being paid, of course😉).

If you haven’t done cold outreach yourself: You should NOT be hiring.

If you can’t point to your own cold outreach metrics and show your reps exactly how your emails and cold calls generated revenue (with real email templates and recorded calls!)… I repeat: Do not hire.

Before you hire, you need to have done the full sales cycle yourself — prospecting, outreach, nurturing, closing — for at least 1–2 months. Otherwise, you’re flying blind and setting your sales team up to fail.

*If you’re reading this thinking about joining an early-stage startup as a first sales hire — ask to see this data first. If the founders can’t show you how their outreach actually closed deals… run.*

**Founders are the problem.**

Most founders avoid sales because it’s uncomfortable, hard, and makes them feel small. So they skip the grind, hire reps without data, dump impossible quotas on them, and then expect magic.

When it doesn’t happen, they blame the reps, label them “underperformers,” and fire them — ruining careers and wasting investor cash — all while sipping lattes, shrugging, “Sales just didn’t work.”

At my last startup ($15M+ valuation), I made this exact mistake. I was a 19-year-old technical founder who thought “More reps = more sales.”

It was a disaster. SDRs missed quotas, morale tanked, and I had no idea why, because I’d never sold the product myself.

Then I got my hands dirty— prospecting, emailing, nurturing, closing— for 1–2 months and finally understood the sales math:

* How many outreaches equal a meeting?
* How many meetings equal a closed deal?
* What’s the average deal size? $$$

Only then did everything change.

As a founder it is your responsibility to master these “macro” metrics alongside “micro” metrics like reply rates before hiring a sales team and giving them quotas.

There are two main sales roles:

**SDRs (Sales Development Reps) are lead generators.**

They prospect, cold email, cold call, and book qualified meetings — conversations with prospects who fit your ideal customer profile, have a real need, and agree to a sales conversation. Not just coffee chats.

**AEs (Account Executives) are closers.** They run demos, handle objections, negotiate, and turn qualified meetings into paying customers.

Quotas vary by market size— SMB, mid-market, enterprise— but here’s the comp structure you should be able to afford:

* SDRs: 2/3 base salary + 1/3 commission, paid on qualified meetings booked (not casual chats).
* AEs: 50/50 base + commission, typically 10% of closed revenue.

Example: An AE closing $500k/year = $50k base + $50k commission, costing you \~20% of revenue and an SDR should cost you roughly 10-15% of the revenue they bring in.

If you can’t afford these comp structures, do not hire yet.

**So Founders: Stop hiring a sales team and then expecting sales magic.**

Nothing is beneath you as a founder, so do your damn homework before you ask people new to uproot their lives and come work for you.

Don’t ruin salespeople’s careers with unrealistic fairy tale expectations. Your hires deserve better.

**As a founder it’s your** ***duty*** **to grind through the full sales cycle yourself first. Master the numbers. Then hire. Then scale.** That’s how I grew to hundreds of thousands per month in closed ARR at my last startup…

And it’s exactly why I’m doing the outreach grind again *right now* for my new startup, [**Rivin.ai**](http://rivin.ai/)— building software for Walmart brands and sellers. Currently in the trenches figuring out my sales numbers before I scale up our sales team.

1mwjkw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/b2b_sales/comments/1mwjkw2/you_should_not_join_an_early_stage_startup/,You Should Not Join An Early Stage Startup.,"Most startups think they need to hire a sales team ASAP.

But here’s the truth: If you’re thinking about joining an early-stage startup as one of the first sales hires — you need to ask the hard questions *before* you sign anything.

Has the founder actually done cold outreach themselves? Can they show you their real outreach metrics— how many emails, calls, and messages it took to book meetings?

Can they prove that their emails and cold calls actually closed deals? With email templates and *recorded* calls?

If the answer is no— don’t walk. ***Run away.***

Because most founders hate sales. It’s hard, uncomfortable, and scary. So instead of doing the initial work themselves, they hire reps without data, dump impossible quotas on them, and expect magic. Then, when reps miss those quotas (which is *almost* *always*), the founders blame them, label them “underperformers” and fire them— burning careers and cash. I’ve seen it happen so many times.

⸻

Here’s what you *need* to know before joining any startup sales team:

At my last startup— a $15M+ company where we closed hundreds of thousands a month in ARR— I made this mistake too. I (a 19-year old idiot technical founder) hired SDRs before I did the sales grind myself.

It was a disaster. My reps had no consistent leads, missed quotas, and morale tanked.

Why? Because I had no sales data. I hadn’t done the full sales cycle — prospecting, outreach, nurturing, closing — for even 1–2 months.

When I finally did, I learned the real numbers:

* How many outreach touches equal a meeting?
* How many meetings actually close?
* What’s the average deal size?

This “sales math” is everything. Without it, you’re flying blind.

⸻

What do SDRs and AEs really do? *(for those that don’t know)*

**SDRs** (Sales Development Reps) are hunters. They prospect, cold email, cold call, and book *qualified* meetings.

What’s a qualified meeting? It’s a conversation with a prospect who fits the ideal customer profile, has a real need, and agrees to a sales conversation— not just a coffee chat or casual talk.

**AEs** (Account Executives) are closers. They take those qualified leads, run demos, handle objections, negotiate, and close deals.

⸻

Here’s what you should expect on comp and quotas:

* **SDRs** usually get 2/3 base salary + 1/3 commission, paid on *qualified meetings booked* (not just casual chats). Quotas vary depending on the market size like SMB, mid-market, enterprise. But the typical comp is 10-15% of revenue brought in.
* **AEs** usually get a 50/50 split of base + commission, with commissions around 10% of closed revenue.

Example: An AE closing $500k in annual revenue might get $50k base + $50k commission, which costs the company roughly 20% of the revenue.

If the startup *can’t* afford to pay you this way, they *should NOT* be hiring you.

⸻

**What I’m doing now:** Right now, I’m grinding through cold outreach myself at my new startup, Rivin.ai, helping Walmart sellers and brands get the data they need to win on Walmart.com... so we can begin hiring our sales team the right way in early October.

An incredible musician. A force of nature. Our friend. My friend. I got the news today from the Mastodon boys as I was having coffee with my mother and her partner. They’re talking about their plans for the upcoming weekend, but I couldn’t really hear what they were saying, to be honest. I was (and still am) overwhelmed by shock. I reached out to the boys in my band delivering the tragic news and my phone has been buzzing every 10 seconds since. There’s so much to be said about Brent. We’ve spend so much time together with him on the road. I like to think we got to know each other quite well. Brent demanded attention (and got it) every time he stepped into our dressing room or bus, which was quite often, I'd might add. Fred and him would jam backstage. I’d keep an eye on him/them and their usual tour-shenanigans to the point where Brent started calling me ”Dad”, and I was calling him ”Son”.

I have so many memories of him, most of which I can sum up as ”good times”. We often talked about stage nerves. How nervousness can be good, but also, if bad, how it can hinder your performance. The latter sensation manifested itself as a fictional person: ”Peter”. Brent would go: ”Peter was on stage tonight, and that fucker sucks ass” when he had a bad show.

It’s too soon to grieve I suppose, this hasn’t sunk in at all. I only just heard about this tragedy 5 hours ago. It’s beyond devastating, and judging from what’s being said on our private Opeth group-chat I know I can speak for the whole band.

The ”Dad-Son” thing stuck over the years. I last saw Brent when he came to our show in Atlanta (October 22, 2024). He walks in and goes ”What’s up Pops?”. It’s a very, very bright memory but it makes me numb with sadness right now, thinking about it.

We’d like to offer our warmest and most loving condolences to his family and friends, colleagues, fans, and of course to the whole Mastodon inner circle. The incredible band that was instrumental for making us and the world aware of the phenomenon that is Brent Hinds. Note that I can’t write about him in past tense just yet. He still ”is”.

I’ve included a photo of myself and Brent from our last tour together. I fail to remember where it was taken, but I remember we're singing along to Van Halen’s ”5150”. Right there, is exactly how I will remember him. Always.

Brent Hinds, rest in peace.

I watched the sun burn off the morning fog quick, left the fields looking sharp enough to cut yourself on. Felt good walking the ridge trail, watching the town stretch awake. Ain't nothing glamorous, but it’s got a heartbeat steady as a metronome.

The damned market was picked thin again. I couldn’t even find coffee filters, just paper towels cut down to size in the basket up front. Owner says it’s “Supply chain problems.” His smile looked like he stole it from a wax museum. Saw a kid sneak out with a bag of pretzels under his coat... didn’t have the heart to call him on it. Times are odd.

Sheriff’s boys were parked outside the station... three cruisers lined up, all engines off, just sitting. I don’t think I’ve ever seen them not moving around town. Thought about asking, thought better of it.

Stopped down at the garage to gab a bit with ol' Henry. Old man had the radio on, voice of some panicked broadcaster muffled through the static. He clicked it off when I walked in and muttered something about “city folks stirring trouble again.” His hands were black with grease and shaking like leaves. Says this rot's creeping closer still. Reporters say that safe-zones have already become compromised on the coast. Hate to think it, but what if SHTF and it all collapsed?

Strange how quiet the air felt tonight, maybe it's deep in thought too... Like the bugs didn’t get the memo to chirp. Streetlights flickered early, too. Maybe the grid’s tired of keeping us lit. Maybe I’m just noticing more than usual.

Anyway, it was an ordinary day, if you squint at it right. Just a few off-notes in the tune.

1mwjjev,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1mwjjev/these_are_my_words_the_tool_is_not_the_author/,These Are My Words. The Tool Is Not the Author.,"# These Are My Words. The Tool Is Not the Author.

Picture this: A critic reads two paragraphs. One I wrote longhand at 3 AM, scratching out half the words, bleeding coffee on the margins. The other I wrote by feeding my messy thoughts into an LLM, iterating through twelve versions until the idea crystallized. Both say the exact same thing about the same topic with the same evidence and the same conclusion. The critic calls the first ""authentic"" and the second ""cheating."" This is not literary criticism. This is cargo cult thinking wearing a graduate degree.

No, I did not outsource my brain. The words you are reading are mine. The idea that a language model transforms my thoughts into someone else's authorship is a category error that looks clever in comment threads and collapses under contact with reality.

Here is the simple version. When I write with an LLM, I am not delegating thinking. I am using a lathe for language. The raw stock is mine. The measurements are mine. The machine lets me shape the material faster, straighter, cleaner. If you think the lathe owns the table, you do not understand either carpentry or authorship. The surgeon does not lose credit for the operation because she used a scalpel instead of a butter knife.

Authenticity is not a purity test about which tool touched the sentence. Authenticity is whether the meaning, intention, and responsibility trace back to the same person. I set the frame, specify the thesis, constrain the tone, supply evidence, reject bad moves, refine structure, and keep veto power. I am the author. The model is a patient apprentice who can fetch lumber and repeat my cut while I check angles. The conductor does not become less musical because the orchestra amplifies her vision.

If you accept dictation into a microphone, you did not cheat the page. If you run your draft through spellcheck, you did not betray your voice. If you hire a translator to convert your English into Mandarin, the translator did not steal your book. Modern writing is a pipeline of cognition through tools. Pens, keyboards, search engines, grammar checkers, and now models that can rearrange what I already know I want to say. The pipeline got better. My agency did not move. Efficiency is not theft.

Let me present the strongest case against my position, because intellectual honesty demands it. The critics say: ""Language models are trained on billions of texts. When you use one, you are not writing. You are sampling from a statistical distribution of how millions of other people have written about similar topics. Your 'voice' is just an averaged echo of the training corpus. The model cannot separate your intent from its learned patterns. Therefore, the output is necessarily derivative, inauthentic, and not truly yours. You become a curator of algorithmic pastiche, not an author.""

That argument has teeth. It deserves a real response, not a dismissive wave. Here it is: Yes, models learn from existing text. So do humans. Every fluent writer is a walking corpus of absorbed patterns from books, articles, conversations, and arguments. We do not write from a void. We remix the linguistic DNA we inherited from thousands of sources. The difference is not the presence of influence. The difference is the locus of selection and accountability. I choose which patterns serve my intent. I choose which continuations survive. I choose the frame that makes certain ideas possible and others forbidden. Agency is authorship. The model predicts; I decide.

A common objection: ""But the model predicts the next word. Those are its words."" Every fluent human predicts the next word. We all run statistical models in meat. The LLM does the same mechanical step at industrial speed. The difference is who is accountable for the choice. I choose which continuation survives. Agency is authorship. The piano does not compose the sonata because it made the notes audible.

Another objection: ""But the model could write similar words for someone else."" So could a typewriter. So could a ghostwriter. So could every writing guide ever published. Similarity is not theft if the similarity is at the level of structure and technique. The content is mine. The lived coherence is mine. I can explain why this argument takes this turn and not that one. I can defend the claims without consulting a log file. If you can interrogate me about any sentence and I can justify it, the authorship is mine. The recipe does not own the dish.

Rapid fire, because some objections are too weak to deserve full paragraphs: ""But it is not natural."" Neither are eyeglasses, but we do not make blind people stumble to preserve authenticity. ""But it gives you an unfair advantage."" So does literacy. So does access to libraries. Welcome to human civilization, where tools compound capability. ""But what about students cheating."" That is a pedagogy problem, not a technology problem. If your assignment can be automated, write better assignments. ""But it lacks soul."" Define soul in a way that survives five minutes of philosophical scrutiny. I will wait.

There is a deeper mistake here. People think the path a thought takes determines its validity. If my idea passes through a keyboard, they nod. If it passes through a model, they decide the thought is contaminated. That is superstition wearing a lab coat. Validity lives in correspondence and coherence. Did I make a true claim? Did the structure support the thesis? The path is irrelevant if the meaning remains and I own it. The telescope does not invalidate the star.

Language itself exposes the absurdity. None of us invent words from nothing. We inherit a dictionary built by strangers. We pick from public patterns. Authorship emerges not from inventing new letters, but from choosing and assembling them into a pattern that encodes a specific intention. An LLM is a dynamic dictionary and a shapeable editor. The intention is still the source of the signal. The map does not create the territory.

My process is not mystical. I start with the core pressure: the thing that will not leave me alone. I write snippets, shards, provocations. Then I ask the model to scaffold structure, to linearize the storm. I give it constraints: tone, tempo, target audience, forbidden phrases. It proposes a shape. I accept the bones that match my mental outline and throw the rest away. I rephrase, cut, graft, reorder. I run that loop until the piece says what I meant before I started. The tool accelerates convergence. It does not substitute for intent. The compass points north; the navigator chooses the route.

Think about cameras. They did not end painting. They changed it. Painters stopped chasing photorealism and went where cameras could not go. A camera does not steal authorship from a photographer because glass bent light. The shot is still a decision. Framing is a decision. Timing is a decision. In the same way, a model does not steal authorship from a writer because silicon helped collapse the search space. The choices remain mine. The hammer does not build the house.

Now, let me be clear about what actual AI slop looks like, because the difference matters. Real AI slop has tells: generic phrasing that sounds like committee-speak, ideas that never quite land because no human checked if they made sense, transitions that feel algorithmic rather than logical, conclusions that trail off because the model ran out of coherent things to say. It reads like a confident Wikipedia summary of a topic the author never understood. The voice is smooth but hollow, like listening to someone read a script about their own life. AI slop happens when people abdicate curation. It does not happen when people use AI to better express what they already know they want to say.

Here are the bright lines for ethical AI-assisted writing: Own your claims. Be able to defend them. Take responsibility for errors. Do not publish things you do not believe. Do not use AI to impersonate someone else. Do not generate content outside your expertise and pass it off as authoritative. Do not copy-paste without understanding. Do not automate away the parts that require human judgment, like fact-checking, bias-testing, and ethical review. These rules are not about tools. They are about integrity.

The red lines: When you ask AI to write something you could not write yourself on the same topic, you are no longer the author. When you publish AI output without reading it carefully, you are no longer the author. When you use AI to make claims outside your knowledge without verifying them, you are no longer the author. When you cannot explain why a sentence is in your piece, you are no longer the author. These distinctions matter because responsibility matters.

The real issue is power and property, not authenticity. Who owns the tools. Who controls the models. Who sets the defaults that define what is easy to say and what is frictioned. If a handful of firms constrain the linguistic substrate and gate the means of expression, that is a problem. The solution is not to throw away augmentation. The solution is to democratize it. Make the substrate public infrastructure, not a luxury service.

None of that changes the core point. These are my words. They match my beliefs, my operating assumptions, my analysis of systems. There is continuity between what I argue in conversation and what shows up on the page. If the page sounds cleaner, that is the point. A tool that trims fat and finds rhythm is doing what editors have always done. We credited the writer because the writer remained the source of intention and the bearer of risk. The lens does not see; the eye does.

Thought is not a precious mineral mined from a single mind. It is a field phenomenon. We are pattern resonators. We discover ideas as much as we invent them. When I use a model, I am not switching off my cognition. I am adding a lens to an already composite instrument. The signal is still mine because I am the one steering, filtering, aligning, and deciding when the picture is true enough to share with my name attached. The microscope reveals; it does not create.

Let's run a thought experiment. I draft a paragraph longhand. I type it exactly as written. I run it through a model with the instruction: preserve meaning, tighten cadence, remove filler, keep my voice. The model returns a tighter version that carries the same claims, the same evidence, the same conclusions. Which one is more authentic? The one that wastes your time, or the one that respects it? If you choose the less clear version because it is ""pure,"" you have confused process with authorship and pain with value. Suffering is not a virtue. Clarity is.

So what does this mean for the world? For education: Stop designing assignments that can be automated. Start teaching students how to use AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for thinking. For publishing: Develop standards around disclosure and accountability, not bans on tools. For creative industries: Embrace augmentation that frees humans for higher-order work instead of fighting tools that handle drudgery. For all of us: Learn to distinguish between automation (replacing human judgment) and augmentation (enhancing human capability). The future belongs to people who can dance with machines, not people who insist on dancing alone.

The critics will keep moving the goalposts. First they said AI could never be creative. Then they said it could never be coherent. Now they say coherent creativity does not count if silicon touched it. Next they will say something else, because the real fear is not about authorship. It is about obsolescence. Let me save them some time: humans who use AI well will outcompete humans who do not. This is not a moral statement. It is a practical one. Adapt or fall behind. The choice is yours.

Here is my stance, clean and final. Using an LLM to write is augmentation, not automation. It is an extension of attention. It does not replace conviction. It does not absolve me of responsibility. It does not convert my mind into a rental unit. If the words carry my meaning, if I can defend them, and if I take accountability for them, they are mine. You can keep your purity tests. I will keep my agency, my speed, and my duty to say things that matter while they still can change something.

The argument lives in my mouth. The responsibility sits on my shoulders. The meaning flows from my convictions. The tool disappears when I speak these ideas aloud, but the ideas remain because they were mine before silicon ever touched them. If that is not authorship, then authorship never existed in the first place.

**tl;dr:** Using an LLM doesn’t make the words less mine. It’s a tool, like a lathe, camera, or spellcheck—something that sharpens expression without replacing intent. Authorship lives in agency, responsibility, and meaning, not in the purity of the tool. Critics call it “cheating” because they confuse process with authorship, but the reality is simple: if I choose, direct, refine, and stand behind the words, they’re authentically mine. The problem isn’t AI, it’s who owns the tools—so the answer is democratization, not superstition. Augmentation is not automation.",0,1755801903.0,ArtificialInteligence,21,0.25,False

I didn't see anybody killing anyone. I lied curtly.  Oh really! His eye brows lifted up. then who is this? He pointed towards the laptop which was placed on the coffee table.

CW mention of past eating disorder and weight.

38 year old female, 5' 5"" 125lbs, never smoked, light/social drinker, no recreational drugs presently. 

Current diagnosis of asthma, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, intersitial cystitis, CPTSD, ADHD, anemia (I think macrocytic? My iron is normal, vitamin D low, folate high, low rbcs and high mcv for many years) * I will follow up with labs

Current medications: burpropion 100mg QD, vyvanse 20mg QD, escitalopram 20mg QD Adderall 5mg PRN, clonodine PRN. I've been on the same medications with only slight variations in dose for 2+ years

Relevant history: I've had a Paraguard copper IUD for 8 years. I have regular periods with varying cycle lengths between 28 and 32 days. One pregnancy 8 years ago, one medical abortion. 14 years ago I experienced amenorrhea for about 3 years as a result of a restrictive eating disorder. Hormones, weight gain, a dietician and ed recovery resolved that issue in less than a year and it's never reoccured. I was around 110 when I lost my period and on a vegan diet while overexcercising. Im currently 125, an omnivore, not on a diet, do light excerice like walks. Normal and regular BMs. Frequent urination but that's normal for me. I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis at least 5 years ago. Bladder ultrasound was normal. I've seen a specialist and she just said to drink less coffee (which didn't help.) I get regular STI tests all normal. 

Signs and symptoms: I skipped 2 periods. I have nausea and increased sense of smell. No bloating, no weight gain, no abdominal pain, no breast tenderness, no food cravings or increased appetite. IUD string seems to be the same length. I've had it checked over the years by ultrasound and I've never had an issue. I've taken many at home pregnancy tests, all negative. I was pregnant once before and I knew 100% before it even showed up on tests. I dont feel pregnant. I have a VERY flat stomach, I can't even eat a burrito without it changing 😆, and its completely flat still. It was noticeable immediately last time and I was only pregnant for about 7 weeks. Im going to the doctor today for my annual physical including a blood pregnancy test. I will request an ultrasound. I know the differential includes pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy, even with negative tests. 

My question is, if they confirm I am not pregnant, what else could cause these symptoms? What tests should I be asking for, what referrals should I be asking for? If I'm not proactive my doctor doesn't tend to offer more tests or referrals. I imagine she'd just say to come back if it persists. I'm really worried, I don't think i could handle a wait-and-see approach in this case. Menstrual cycle is an important sign of general health and I can't think of anything that would suddenly stop mine at age 38 that isn't a serious issue.

If you haven’t done cold outreach yourself: You should NOT be hiring.

If you can’t point to your own cold outreach metrics and show your reps exactly how your emails and cold calls generated revenue (with real email templates and recorded calls!)…

I repeat: Do not hire.

Before you hire, you need to have done the full sales cycle yourself — prospecting, outreach, nurturing, closing — for at least 1–2 months. Otherwise, you’re flying blind and setting your sales team up to fail.

*If you’re reading this thinking about joining an early-stage startup as a first sales hire — ask to see this data first. If the founders can’t show you how their outreach actually closed deals… run.*

**Founders are the problem.**

Most founders avoid sales because it’s uncomfortable, hard, and makes them feel small. So they skip the grind, hire reps without data, dump impossible quotas on them, and then expect magic.

When it doesn’t happen, they blame the reps, label them “underperformers,” and fire them — ruining careers and wasting investor cash — all while sipping lattes, shrugging, “Sales just didn’t work.”

At my last startup ($15M+ valuation), I made this exact mistake. I was a 19-year-old technical founder who thought “More reps = more sales.”

It was a disaster. SDRs missed quotas, morale tanked, and I had no idea why, because I’d never sold the product myself.

Then I got my hands dirty— prospecting, emailing, nurturing, closing— for 1–2 months and finally understood the sales math:

* How many outreaches equal a meeting?
* How many meetings equal a closed deal?
* What’s the average deal size? $$$

Only then did everything change.

As a founder it is your responsibility to master these “macro” metrics alongside “micro” metrics like reply rates before hiring a sales team and giving them quotas.

There are two main sales roles:

**SDRs (Sales Development Reps) are lead generators.**

They prospect, cold email, cold call, and book qualified meetings — conversations with prospects who fit your ideal customer profile, have a real need, and agree to a sales conversation. Not just coffee chats.

**AEs (Account Executives) are closers.** They run demos, handle objections, negotiate, and turn qualified meetings into paying customers.

Quotas vary by market size— SMB, mid-market, enterprise— but here’s the comp structure you should be able to afford:

* SDRs: 2/3 base salary + 1/3 commission, paid on qualified meetings booked (not casual chats).
* AEs: 50/50 base + commission, typically 10% of closed revenue.

Example: An AE closing $500k/year = $50k base + $50k commission, costing you \~20% of revenue.

If you can’t afford these comp structures, don’t hire yet.

**So Founders: Stop hiring a sales team and then expecting sales magic.**

Nothing is beneath you as a founder, so do your damn homework before you ask people new to uproot their lives and come work for you.

Don’t ruin salespeople’s careers with unrealistic fairy tale expectations. Your hires deserve better.

**As a founder it’s your** ***duty*** **to grind through the full sales cycle yourself first. Master the numbers. Then hire. Then scale.** That’s how I grew to hundreds of thousands per month in closed ARR at my last startup…

And it’s exactly why I’m doing the outreach grind again *right now* for my new startup, [**Rivin.ai**](http://rivin.ai/)— building software for Walmart brands and sellers. Currently in the trenches figuring out my sales numbers before I scale up our sales team.

# Step 1: Getting Access to This AI Video Generator 🚀

First, you need to get access to Qwen 2.2 Plus.

This AI video generator is completely free and open source.

Here are three ways to access this AI video generator:

**Option 1: Direct Download** Visit the official Qwen repository on GitHub. Download the model files to your computer. Run the AI video generator locally using the provided instructions.

**Option 2: Cloud Platforms** Several online platforms offer easy access to this AI video generator. Create an account on platforms like Replicate or Hugging Face. Access the AI video generator through their web interface.

For beginners, I recommend starting with Option 2.

Cloud platforms make this AI video generator accessible without technical setup.

You can start creating videos immediately without downloads or installation.

# Step 2: Understanding AI Video Generator Prompt Structure 📝

The secret to professional results with this AI video generator is writing effective prompts.

Here's the exact structure that works:

**Basic Prompt Formula:** \[Camera Movement\] + \[Subject\] + \[Action\] + \[Setting\] + \[Lighting\] + \[Style\]

**Example:** ""Drone shot of a young woman walking through a sunlit forest, golden hour lighting, cinematic style""

Let me break down each component:

**Camera Movement:**

* Close-up shot
* Medium shot
* Wide shot
* Drone shot
* Tracking shot
* Crane shot

**Subject:** Be specific about who or what is in your video. ""Young woman in casual clothes"" is better than ""person.""

**Action:** Describe exactly what's happening. ""Walking slowly"" is better than ""moving.""

**Setting:** Paint a clear picture of the environment. ""Sunlit forest with tall pine trees"" creates better context than ""forest.""

**Lighting:** This is crucial for professional results with this AI video generator. ""Golden hour,"" ""soft natural light,"" or ""dramatic side lighting"" all produce different moods.

**Style:** ""Cinematic,"" ""documentary,"" or ""commercial"" tells the AI video generator what aesthetic to achieve.

Master this formula and your results will improve dramatically.

# Step 3: Your First AI Video Generator Project 🎬

Let's create your first professional video using this AI video generator.

We'll make a product demonstration video that could sell for $1,000 if produced traditionally.

**Project Goal:** Create a coffee product showcase video

**Step 3a: Write Your Prompt** ""Close-up shot of steam rising from a freshly brewed cup of coffee, warm morning light streaming through a window, shallow depth of field, commercial style""

**Step 3b: Generate Your Video** Input this prompt into the AI video generator. Wait 15-30 seconds for processing. The AI video generator will create a professional-looking coffee commercial.

**Step 3c: Evaluate the Result** Does the steam look realistic? Is the lighting warm and inviting? Does it look like a professional commercial?

If yes, you've just created a $1,000 video for free.

If not, let's optimize the prompt.

**Step 3d: Prompt Optimization** Try adding more specific details: ""Extreme close-up of white ceramic coffee mug with steam gently rising in spiral patterns, soft golden morning sunlight filtering through sheer curtains, shallow depth of field with blurred kitchen background, high-end commercial product photography style""

Notice how much more specific this version is.

The AI video generator responds better to detailed instructions.

# Step 4: Advanced AI Video Generator Techniques 🎯

Now that you understand the basics, let's explore advanced techniques.

**Technique 1: Image-to-Video Generation** This AI video generator can start with your existing images. Upload a product photo. Add a prompt describing the motion you want. ""Add gentle rotation to the product, soft lighting, commercial style.""

**Technique 2: Style Consistency** Create multiple videos that look like they're from the same production. Use consistent lighting descriptions across all prompts. Maintain the same style modifier (""cinematic,"" ""commercial,"" etc.). Use similar camera movement patterns.

**Technique 3: Scene Transitions** Plan a series of connected shots. Start with a wide establishing shot. Move to medium shots of the action. End with close-up detail shots. Edit these together for a complete narrative.

**Technique 4: Emotion and Mood** This AI video generator can create specific emotional tones. ""Cheerful woman laughing in bright sunlight"" creates one mood. ""Contemplative man staring out a rain-soaked window"" creates another. Use emotional descriptors to enhance your storytelling.

# Step 5: Creating Different Types of Videos with This AI Video Generator 📹

Let's walk through creating specific video types that businesses need:

**Social Media Content:** ""Medium shot of a smiling chef preparing fresh pasta in a modern kitchen, natural lighting, bright and energetic style""

This AI video generator prompt creates engaging content for restaurant social media.

**Product Demonstrations:** ""Tracking shot following a smartphone as it slides across a marble surface, dramatic studio lighting highlighting the device's sleek design, premium commercial style""

Perfect for e-commerce product pages.

**Educational Content:** ""Close-up hands demonstrating a knitting technique with colorful yarn, soft natural lighting, clear and instructional style""

Ideal for online courses and tutorials.

**Brand Storytelling:** ""Wide shot of a small coffee shop at dawn with warm lights glowing inside, people beginning to gather, cozy and inviting atmosphere""

Great for brand videos and about pages.

**Event Promotion:** ""Dynamic montage of musicians setting up equipment on an outdoor stage, golden hour lighting, energetic festival atmosphere""

Perfect for event marketing.

Each video type requires specific prompting strategies with this AI video generator.

# Step 6: AI Video Generator Quality Control Checklist ✅

Before publishing any video created with this AI video generator, run through this quality control process:

**Technical Quality:**

* Is the motion smooth throughout the entire clip?
* Are there any flickering or inconsistent elements?
* Does the lighting remain consistent?
* Is the image sharp and clear?

**Content Accuracy:**

* Does the video match your prompt description?
* Are all elements positioned correctly?
* Does the style match your brand guidelines?
* Is the mood appropriate for your message?

**Professional Standards:**

* Would you be proud to show this to clients?
* Does it look professionally produced?
* Is it engaging enough to hold viewer attention?
* Does it accomplish your marketing goal?

If any answer is ""no,"" regenerate the video with an improved prompt.

This AI video generator makes it easy to create multiple variations until you get perfect results.

Remember, quality control is crucial when using any AI video generator for professional purposes.

# Step 7: Troubleshooting Common AI Video Generator Issues 🛠️

Even with perfect prompts, you might encounter issues with this AI video generator.

Here's how to solve the most common problems:

**Problem: Motion Looks Unnatural** Solution: Add physics-based descriptors like ""smoothly glides"" or ""gently flows"" to your prompts.

**Problem: Objects Change Appearance Mid-Video**  
Solution: Be more specific about object descriptions. Instead of ""car,"" use ""red Tesla Model 3.""

**Problem: Lighting Inconsistency** Solution: Include specific lighting terms like ""consistent soft lighting throughout"" in your prompt.

**Problem: Poor Image Quality** Solution: Add ""high resolution,"" ""sharp focus,"" or ""professional quality"" to your prompts.

**Problem: AI Video Generator Ignores Parts of Your Prompt** Solution: Simplify your prompt. This AI video generator works better with clear, concise instructions.

**Problem: Results Don't Match Your Vision** Solution: Study successful prompts and adapt them to your needs. The AI Profit Boardroom has hundreds of tested prompts.

  NOW  
  
  “So, after the loss of your mother in the car accident, you started work to redeem her amnesiac murderer, met a new boy at school, who you hid your attraction from in order to protect a friend’s feelings. Then you learned the boy was being hunted by the CIA—one of their agents who happens to be trying to date your dad … hunted because the boy’s a werewolf.”  
  
  There was a long pause. I ran over her summary, mentally ticking off the checklist of the bizarre that my life had so recently been reduced to. “You forgot about the Russian Mafia’s involvement and the shoot-out we were in.”  
  
  Looking at her clipboard, Dr. Jones replied, “Yes. So I did.” She jotted something down. “Well. It looks like our time is up.” She clicked her pen and set it down definitively on her broad ebony desk. “Your story is absolutely fascinating.” She confirmed what I knew too well. “But.”  
  
  I sat up, the leather couch creaking beneath me. I gave her my best but what? look. I’d talked forever.  
  
  As much as I hated to admit it, the school counselors were right. It felt great to get it all out and tell an objective professional. So I waited, looking at her expectantly. She could surely say more than but after all I’d confessed.  
  
  “But, if you really want to get past the trauma of your mother’s death—which is truly the crux of your situation—you’ll need to get real here.” She stood, lips twisting.  
  
  Get real? I had told her everything. I had risked the Rusakovas to save my own crumbling sense of sanity.  
  
  I couldn’t help it. I laughed so hard I snorted.  
  
  In the two months since I’d met Pietr Rusakova I could number on one hand the times I’d told the truth. The lies? The phrase totally out of hand had special meaning when trying to keep track of them.  
  
  But to finally try and straighten things out and be shut down? Not what I expected.  
  
  She blinked at me. “Seriously, Jessica. Russian Mafia? Government agents? Werewolves?” She laughed. “I should be like other psychiatrists, I guess, and blindly prescribe something with an exciting new name. But I want to help you get better, not medicate you. I want you to get a grip.”  
  
  “You don’t believe me.”  
  
  “It’s my professional opinion that you’re screwing with me. Most kids clam up on their first visit or avoid the heart of their issues. But you”—she glanced at the clipboard—“are an editor for the school newspaper. Surely inventive. So you chose the other route, exhibiting a commendable streak of creativity. But I have a high crap tolerance.”  
  
  Her voice lowered and she ruffled the corners of her freshly written notes. “You have to, working with kids,” she muttered. “You’re no more delusional than the average teenager.”  
  
  “I killed a man.” God, for all the notes she seemed to take, did she not listen?  
  
  “Yes, Jessica, so you said. But where’s the body, sweetie? I’d expect some part of the aftermath of a bloodbath like you described to be seen by someone. Why wasn’t there anything in the papers?”  
  
  “I told you before. The agents called in a—” I chewed my lower lip. Why wouldn’t the right words come when I needed them? “A cleaning crew.”  
  
  “Yes, the agents.” She made quotes in the air with a twitch of her fingers. “Including”—she flipped through the papers on her clipboard until she found it—“Wanda the librarian.”  
  
  “No one gives librarians the credit they deserve,” I snapped. “Yes. She works in the reference department and is a gun-toting government agent.”  
  
  “Of course,” Dr. Jones said, still smiling. “So. Creative, and probably with a large number of overdue books causing you to be creatively suspicious about librarians. Interesting.”  
  
  I had no idea what else to say. I’d surely said it all.  
  
  “Anyway. It’s your insurance coverage. You decide if you want to waste it on fantasies.”  
  
  She turned away to look out the window—a clear dismissal. I stood, slung my purse over my shoulder, and headed out the door, as confused as when I’d first arrived.  
  
  I’d decided to adjust to my new normal. Regular counseling. A life with no mother. No more shoot-outs with the Russian Mafia. Nearly no CIA presence. And a werewolf sort-of-boyfriend who was also still seeing my not-quite-stable friend Sarah because we hoped to avoid triggering her return to absolute psychosis.  
  
  Okay, so my new normal wasn’t nearly normal by other people’s standards, but it was the best I could do.  
  
  I was back to horse riding and farm chores and trying to keep up with my classes and working on the school newspaper.  
  
  I still had my friends. Amy had my back, and Sophia, well, she was hanging around enough that I knew she cared—or was fascinated by the tragedy that seemed to continually wash over me. And there was Sarah—beautifully angelic and with so little of her original memory she was almost safe to be around.  
  
  I hoped.  
  
  Derek (the star of our football team) shadowed me now, too, frequently appearing and smiling at me in a way that made my heart race. I’d had a crush of Titanic (and I do mean like the ship that nailed the iceberg) proportions on him. For years.  
  
  Well, until Pietr showed up and everything changed.  
  
  Anyhow, my new normal should have been a good thing. Not perfect, but acceptable. Nearly sane.  
  
  In the nonthreatening beige waiting room people hid behind newspapers and magazines so old their readers were learning history—not catching up on current events.  
  
  All but one.  
  
  Catherine Rusakova waved to me and rose, following me out the door. Normally as unnoticed as a shadow slipping across shade, she was also impossible not to notice when she wanted.  
  
  Like now.  
  
  The office door clicked shut behind me. “Hi, Cat.” I wasn’t sure how to proceed. I wasn’t used to being stalked by Pietr’s twin sister. Werewolf number two.  
  
  Her eyes sparkled, astonishingly blue and faintly slanted, with a fringe of thick lashes. Cat’s strong features and high cheekbones made her look more like a goddess of old than a werewolf.  
  
  Of course, there was probably someplace where the goddess of old was a werewolf.…  
  
  The Rusakovas were at once strong and beautiful: an elegance and brutality blended in their features. Once I’d seen what they became—what they truly were—it was impossible not to see some shadow of the beast slinking within their eyes, some hint of it hiding in the glint of their smiles.  
  
  “Privyet,” Cat greeted me. “I did not realize you were seeing a psychiatrist until your sister told me,” she admitted, the faint roll of her first language softly coloring her words.  
  
  Nice. I’d have to have a little chat with Annabelle Lee later. Sometimes she was far too helpful. Just not to me.  
  
  “Does Pietr know?”  
  
  I shook my head. It was one thing I hadn’t found a way to tell him. It was far easier to talk about school and books than admit to seeing a psychiatrist about serious issues.  
  
  “Considering circumstances, I agree it is wise.” She smiled, and I repressed a shiver. That beautiful grin turned into a devil’s nest of fangs when she wanted. “You have seen a lot of horrible things recently.”  
  
   
; I paused by a potted plant that looked like it needed water—or proper burial. “But?”  
  
  “But what?”  
  
  “I love talking with you, Cat, but why are you here?”  
  
  Cat tilted her head and peeked at me from the corners of her eyes. “It’s not often people outside our family know our truth, Jessie. It might make us nervous to hear the one who does know is talking.”  
  
  “I don’t want to make anyone nervous.” My palms grew damp. Nervous was not a descriptor I wanted applied to any member in a family of werewolves.  
  
  “That is why I chose to come,” Cat explained. “To get a better understanding before the boys find out. You are very important to our family, Jessie. I am convinced of that.”  
  
  “Because I opened the matryoshka and found the pendant?”  
  
  “Da.”  
  
  I watched her, waiting. “And?”  
  
  She sighed. “And because of what your tea leaves said.” Shaking her head, her smile ghosted away. “I must ask you what—”  
  
  “Everything, Catherine. I told her absolutely everything.”  
  
  She stepped back, solemn. “The CIA?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “The Russian Mafia?”  
  
  “Yes.” Tears filled my eyes, threatening to spill.  
  
  “And werewolves. Jessie, you said you’d seen werewolves?”  
  
  “Yes!” I winced, closing my eyes and remembering the dreadful moment I’d seen in so many movies recently—the moment the werewolf changed and tore out a victim’s throat.  
  
  I held my breath.  
  
  Nothing happened.  
  
  I opened my eyes to find Catherine gazing at me with curiosity. Predators did that, though. Studied their prey.  
  
  “I’m sorry, Catherine. I had to say something … had to tell someone.…”  
  
  Her fingers twitched by her hip.  
  
  I shut my eyes again, ready as I could be for certain disemboweling. I’d gutlessly betrayed their family, in an attempt to save my sanity. I deserved no better.  
  
  “What are you doing?” Cat’s words rushed out; she stood so close now her breath was a warm breeze brushing across my face.  
  
  “Waiting.”  
  
  “For what?” she asked.  
  
  “Death?” I squeaked, peeling one eye open to watch her—the way I watched most werewolf films.  
She laughed.  
  
  My heart throbbed against my ribs.  
  
  She grabbed me so fast I nearly peed myself. Holding me in a powerful hug, she whispered, “You are a strange, strange girl, Jessie Gillmansen.”  
  
  Says a werewolf.  
  
  “You should stop watching those awful horror movies.”  
  
  “How did you—? Of course. Annabelle Lee.”  
  
  “She is worried about you.”  
  
  “Ha.”  
  
  “We are not Hollywood’s creations. You know that.”  
  
  “Rationally, yes.” Not Hollywood’s creations, but rather the descendants of one of the USSR’s surprisingly successful scientific experiments from the earliest years of the Cold War.  
  
  Cat nodded. “Does the doctor believe what you said?”  
  
  “Not a word.”  
  
  “Excellent.” She grinned her most wicked grin. “Now you can tell her the truth without repercussions.” She stepped back, toying with her short, dark curls, glittering eyes fixed on me. “Might she medicate you?”  
  
  “Nope. She insists I embrace sanity without chemical assistance.”  
  
  “You are such a clever girl!” She threw her hands into the air. “Strange in your methods, but clever. Oh.” She pinched her ear. “Your father is coming. He should not see me here.”  
  
  “Cat!” I called as she retreated down another hallway. “I need to talk to you about Pietr—”  
  
  She nodded. “I will find you. Tonight. Listen for me.”  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  Sure enough, Dad was headed down the hall toward me. I shouldn’t have been surprised Cat knew, but it was still odd—especially knowing why and how she knew.  
  
  When the Rusakova children each turned thirteen, strange things happened to them—far stranger than the standard hair showing up in weird places that came with normal puberty. At thirteen their ability to hear intensified. At fourteen, their sense of smell sharpened exponentially. When they turned fifteen their strength and agility increased, and sixteen was a year their bodies tried to catch up with the mutations rioting through their systems.  
  
  Then about a week ago, the twins, Pietr and Cat, turned seventeen. To say that turning seventeen had changed them would be an understatement of the oddest sort.  
  
  None of our lives had been the same since.  
  
  “Oh, Jessie!” Dad exclaimed, snapping his cell phone shut. Seeing my eyes pink with unshed tears, he wrapped me in a hug, lifting me and squeezing the air out of my lungs in one long sigh. “The first few times will probably be toughest,” he said, setting me down.  
  
  He smoothed my hair back from my face. “Let’s go now. You look tired.” Putting his hand flat on my back, he steered me down the hall and out the building.  
  
  He opened the truck’s passenger door, a mismatched green that somehow went with the rest of its blue rust-speckled body, and took his spot behind the steering wheel. The truck roared to life, and Dad twisted the knob on the old radio, turning it down.  
  
  “Why are we listening to this station?”  
  
  “There’s nothin’ wrong with this station,” he insisted.  
  
  “It only plays the eighties.”  
  
  “And I repeat—” But he didn’t. He winked instead. “Livin’ on a Prayer,” he said, nodding toward the radio.  
  
  It seemed that’s what I did most days.  
  
  Mom and Dad had both been huge fans of the big-haired bands of eighties rock. Without Mom around, Dad clung to the bits of life they’d shared even harder. Except when he reached out toward Wanda.  
  
  Blech.  
  
  I tried not to think about it as I sank into my seat and stared out the window, barely noticing any of Junction’s Main Street drifting by, its little trees nearly naked as a few dried orange and yellow leaves still held tight, waving in the sharp autumn breeze. An unseasonable cold held Junction in its grasp and even back when we’d thought it was too early for Halloween displays, the dropping leaves and plummeting temperatures made it somehow fitting.  
  
  The three o’clock train shrieked out a whistle, the rattle of its cars muted by a few blocks of the town’s most bustling real estate.  
  
  Dad pulled into the parking lot at McMillan’s. “Just need milk and bread,” he explained as he shut down the truck.  
  
  “Skipper’s has better prices,” I reminded.  
  
  He shot me a look that shut me right up. He would never go back to Skipper’s. It shared a parking lot with the local video rental store. The rental store I was standing outside when Mom came to pick me up the night of June 17.  
  
  The same night Sarah, on a joyride, crashed into Mom’s car and killed her. Dad forgave Sarah’s stupidity and brusquely accepted the new subdued Sarah (amazing what severe head trauma could do to improve a personality), following my lead.  
  
  But the scene of the accident couldn’t change enough for him to move on. The macadam and the surrounding buildings held too many memories. I knew. They’d frequently been the backdrop for my nightmares.  
  
  Until the night the Rusakova twins’ birthday gave me vivid new imagery to replace the old.  
  
  My family had come a long way since the accident. But most days I didn’t think we could ever come far enough.  
  
  I tried to ignore the decorations in the local store windows on the ride home, skeletons and glowing spiders in polyester webs reminding all of Junction that Halloween was crawling ever closer.  
  
  As was my birthday. One more celebration Mom would miss.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  Maybe I looked tired to Dad (king of compliments), but my mind ran so fast I wouldn’t get any peace even if I tried to nap. As soon as I got home I transferred my notes from Friday’s classes. Nearly legible. I highlighted a few key concepts and tucked my notebooks away before heading to the paddock.  
  
  I thought more clearly on the back of a horse.  
  
  Rio, my chestnut mare, whickered a greeting and charged the fence—daring me to stay still.  
  
  To trust her.  
  
  She flew at me, hooves slicing up chunks of soil as she barreled forward, nostrils flared, eyes wild.  
  
  My head up, stance open, I watched her with thinly veiled amusement. She skidded to a halt, spraying dirt up from her steel shoes. Right onto my jeans.  
  
  “Rio,” I admonished.  
  
  She tossed her mane, pushing her snout into my chest so I had no choice but to stroke the sleek bridge of her unmarked nose and marvel at the brightness of her eyes.  
  
  If there was one thing in life I could trust, it was Rio. Horses didn’t lie. Joke? Yes.  
  
  “Let’s go,” I said, slipping her bridle over her head. I climbed onto a fence rail and she maneuvered into position, standing still as stone when I said, “Alley oop,” and mounted.  
  
  No saddle, I felt every move Rio considered, every twitch of muscle, every thought telegraphed back to me. She didn’t need to verbalize to be understood. The swivel of an ear, a snort, or a pawing hoof and I knew what was on her mind or in her heart.  
  
  When life was most confounding, Rio was the blessing best understood. My dogs, Hunter and Maggie, were seldom understood, but ever-present.  
  
  Rio and I did a few passes around the paddock—nothing fancy, nothing stressful, just the lengthening of strides, the ground-swallowing sweep of a smooth gallop and my mind drifted.  
  
  “Whoa!” I tugged on the reins. “Sorry, girl.” We walked a few minutes and I tried to push everything from my mind. It wasn’t happening. Even the rhythmic droning of hoofbeats couldn’t push Pietr’s behavior far enough from my thoughts.  
  
  Since his seventeenth birthday Pietr had become a little distant. We’d agreed he needed to continue dating Sarah, slowly weaning her away from him as he moved closer to me. More than smart not to freak Sarah out or hurt her feelings by having Pietr suddenly dump her, it was kinder, too.  
  
  But doing the kind thing made me even more of a liar. Pietr used to snatch an occasional kiss in a dark corner, grab my hand in his to marvel at my fingers, or just stare for long, breathless moments down into my eyes.  
  
  That was all before he made his first change.  
  
   
; Since then he’d stolen less than a dozen quiet moments with me. And it wasn’t like he was moving forward with Sarah, either.  
  
  Pietr and I still talked on the phone—he seemed to enjoy integrating bits of Russian in our conversations. I knew horashow meant “good” and puzhalsta meant “please” and I could order coffee and find a bathroom if I needed to. Could I read any of it in Cyrillic? Absolutely not. To me, Cyrillic was still nothing but an elegant scrawl.  
  
  The only phrase Pietr denied me was the one I wanted most—and not because I was going to sling it around like it was nothing. But Pietr refused to tell me how to say “I love you” in Russian. Yes, I could have figured it out online, but words just sounded better coming out of Pietr’s mouth. And maybe if he couldn’t say it, I shouldn’t want to know how to, either. It was all so confusing.  
  
  I pulled Rio to a stop and slid off her back, leading her to the barn before gently freeing her from the bridle and rubbing her down with a towel. The door to her stall was pinned open; she had options tonight as chilly as it threatened to be.  
  
  “Good girl,” I assured her. “Believe me. It’s not you, it’s me,” I said wryly, worried the words were ones I might hear from Pietr if I let the distance between us grow.  
  
  \* \* \*  
  
  I washed the last of the dishes and set them in the rack to drip dry as the final beams of sunlight smoldered across the sky and nipped at the racing clouds. Though the wind shook the bare branches of the trees in our yard, I kept the window over the sink open a crack, listening for Catherine’s signal.  
  
  A howl hurtled across our farm, and I jerked drying my fingers on the towel.  
  
  Just the wind.  
  
  Another howl and I started toward the door. This time the noise ended with leaves skittering across our small porch. I sighed and pulled my jacket off its hook.  
  
  “Where are you going?”  
  
  Jumping, I turned to face Annabelle Lee. She had been sitting so quietly reading her latest book, I’d completely forgotten she was still at the table.  
  
  “Out for a walk. It’s a beautiful night.”  
  
  The wind shook our home and Annabelle Lee tore her eyes from the pages of Atlas Shrugged long enough to give me a look that was as easy to read as Rio.  
  
  She did not believe me. Not one bit. “Is Pietr out there? Waiting for you?”  
  
  “What? Who?” Crap! Where was Dad—what were the odds he overheard us?  
  
  She set the book down. “Dad headed back to the factory. Some machine broke and spewed chocolate all over the line. Luckily no one’s hurt. No blood, just foul, he said.”  
  
  “Hmm. Blood and Chocolate. Great book. Not a flavor the factory would want, though.” I shrugged into my jacket.  
  
  “Dad kissed your cheek before he left. I can’t believe you missed that.”  
  
  Touching the spot, I vaguely remembered the rasp of his five o’clock shadow.  
  
  Her eyebrows drew closer together. At twelve, Annabelle Lee was very bright, but she was frequently confounded by people. I often caught her (when she wasn’t reading or snooping) peering at me like something on a microscope slide.  
  
  Studying me. I simply hoped her fascination meant she’d learn enough from my mistakes not to make them her own. “You really want to go for a walk?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  “By yourself?”  
  
  “Yes.”  
  
  The door hummed under the force of the next gust.  
  
  “It’s invigorating,” I insisted, winding my scarf around my neck before topping off my ensemble with a sensible knit hat.  
  
  “Fine. I’m headed to bed.”  
  
  Stepping onto the porch I heard Catherine’s curling cry and wondered how I’d doubted I’d recognize the difference between the wind and the weaving, undulating sound of Catherine bewitching the world in her wolfskin.  
  
  I followed the sound down the slight hill behind our house and into the edge of the woods where the darkness deepened and clung like new growth to autumn’s bare branches.  
  
  “Catherine?”  
  
  The forest went still.  
  
  The wind stopped.  
  
  The few remaining leaves ceased spinning on their branches and a chill climbed up my spine, ignoring my prudent layering.  
  
  “Catherine?” I whispered, surrounded by shadows. My back rigid, I realized this surely qualified as a counterintuitive behavior that—if Darwin was right—would quickly have me removed from the gene pool.  
  
  I’d need to improve my odds of survival if I was going to hang out with werewolves. I reached into my pocket, stroking the smooth and familiar surface of my pietersite worry stone. Stunned by the nerve-grating silence, my eyes strained for some clue to Cat’s location. “Cat?” I tried again, eyes wide and wary.  
  
  In a darkness that made the woods unfamiliar, confused and calling a predator out for a chat—yep—I’d definitely be selected against.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  “Catherine!”  
  
  Hurled to the ground, there wasn’t air left in my lungs for a scream. The wolf stood over me, mouth slick, eyes narrow and blazing blood red. Heavy front paws covered in thick sepia fur pressed into my stomach as claws the length of my thumbs prickled through my jacket and shirt.  
  
  “Caaat,” I wheezed.  
  
  Her mouth opened, displaying an impressive set of fangs. Death sat in those slavering jaws and terror tore at my heart as she bent down, her breath so hot it stung. I closed my eyes.  
  
  She was a werewolf. A hellhound, a skinwalker, shape-shifter— a nightmare able to gnaw my neck off.  
  
  In the movies such encounters never ended well.  
  
  She growled; the sound jackhammered through me.  
  
  Then she licked me.  
  
  A big, slobbery kiss of canine proportions stained my cheek with saliva. She sprang up, yipped like a playful pup, and stood on her hind legs to summon the change.  
  
  Sitting, my arms folded across my chest, I said, “Not funny, Cat.”  
  
  “What?” she asked, all wide-eyed innocence.  
  
  “You shouldn’t sneak up on someone.”  
  
  She cocked her head.  
  
  “Not when you’re—”  
  
  “Wolf?”  
  
  I nodded. Vigorously.  
  
  “But I am always wolf,” she said. “I am oborot.”  
  
  “Obor-what?”  
  
  “Oborot. One transformed.” She smiled ruefully. “Can I not have fun with what I am bound to be?”  
  
  I groaned. “Can we at least agree that you won’t pounce me? Or slaughter me? Or—”  
  
  Her laugh trilled through the trees. “Jessie. You must trust I will never hurt you. None of us would.” She knelt, reclining in the rolling leaves, at home in the woods.  
  
  My shoulders sagged, and my hands fell loosely into my lap. I stared at them. “Pietr’s hurting me—confusing me.”  
  
  “Pietr is just a boy.”  
  
  “Right. And you obviously aren’t. Speaking of which—aren’t you freezing? Where are your clothes?” I tried not to look at Cat as she rested—naked—nearby.  
  
  “Oh. Eezveneetcheh. I am sorry, Jessie. My temperature runs higher with the change. Alexi thinks it is because we cross from aerobic cellular respiration to anaerobic much more efficiently. Something about leaky mitochondrial membranes … ours versus yours.…” She made a show of yawning, her hand fluttering before her open mouth.  
  
  “Oh.”  
  
  “Does my nudity offend you?”  
  
  How could I explain that Cat’s nudity couldn’t offend anyone. She looked so much like a classical Greek statue come to life. The only thing Cat’s nudity offended was my self-esteem.  
  
  “In Europe, nudity is no big deal,” she assured. “The things I saw over there…” She smiled, eyes sparking. “But we are so different here, pravda?”  
  
  I had to believe Russian-American werewolves were different no matter where they were. But I agreed with her. “Da. Pravda. True.”  
  
  She giggled. “The boys carry their clothing in their mouths, but I prefer to run as nature intended. Besides, I have yet to develop a taste for denim.” Shrugging, she added, “I almost always return  
home before changing back.”  
  
  I zipped my jacket up and pulled my knees to my chest. Seeing perfection sprawled out in front of me was making me reassess my feminine attributes. “So you guys never, like, explode out of your clothing, right?”  
  
  She laughed. “Would that not be spectacular? An expensive habit, though—at least if one had a sense of style.” Her nose wrinkled and she leaned forward, cupping her hand around her mouth so the owls and rabbits didn’t overhear. “I did once hear Max exploded out of his, but the circumstances were far different from what you are asking about,” she quipped, adding a wink for good measure. She watched for my reaction, basking boldly under the thin moonlight.  
  
  I blinked.  
  
  “I do not mean to disturb you, Jessie,” she repeated with a melodramatic sigh. “I could shift again, but it would greatly decrease the odds of my half of the conversation being understood.” She grinned. “And God help us if I scent a squirrel while in my wolfskin. My attention span is … utter crap.”  
  
  “It’s okay, Cat. I’ll cope.”  
  
  “Eyes up here, Jessie,” she teased, pointing to her face.  
  
  “Funny girl,” I muttered. “So.”  
  
  “Da. So. What is my little brother doing that has you confused and hurt?”  
  
  “Ugh. He doesn’t kiss me as much as he did. He doesn’t reach for my hand.… It’s like we’re fizzling.”  
  
  “Fizzling?” The smile slid off her face when she tilted her head in wonder. “The change makes things difficult for the boys. Their brain, their communication is no longer clear. Look at Max. Nearly eighteen and stupid.”  
  
  I choked and she smiled again.  
  
  “The brain of the wolf and the brain of the boy do not cooperate well. Girls mature more quickly. Our brain—our emotions—are more advanced when the change comes. Boys are beastly at seventeen whether wolves or not.” Again her nose scrunched up. “He is struggling to adjust. Trying to become comfortable with you seeing him as he is. Trying to become comfortable with who he is.”  
  
  “He seems comfortable enough around Sarah.”  
  
  Cat laughed. “It is easy to seem comfortable when you do not really care.”  
  
  “Seriously? It’s that simple? He doesn’t care about Sarah, so he can be”—taking a breath I steadied my voice—“affectionate with her?

1mwjb0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1mwjb0j/find_out_if_the_best_countertop_dishwasher_hava/,Find Out if the Best Countertop Dishwasher HAVA TDJR09 Is Worth It,"The HAVA TDJR09 countertop dishwasher has been a convenient addition to my daily kitchen routine. I wasn’t expecting to love it so much, but here I am, singing its praises—or at least most of them. It's a freestanding, compact unit with a glossy white finish, and it has quickly proven to be a lifesaver in a small apartment environment. Setting it up for use was almost too straightforward. With no installation required, I simply filled the built-in water tank, connected the outlet hose, and voilà! It was ready to go.  

**Ease of Use and Compact Design**  
Space is at a premium in my tiny kitchen, so the size of this dishwasher makes it a dream. It measures just 16.86 x 16.75 x 18.05 inches, which means it fits snugly on my counter without hogging valuable prep space. The bright LED display and responsive touch controls made the learning curve almost nonexistent. The inclusion of an integrated handle gives it a sleek, modern finish, which matches other appliances well. However, despite the relatively small footprint, it’s surprisingly roomy inside. It cleaned my cereal bowls, dinner plates, and coffee mugs effortlessly, even with the redesigned adjustable dish rack maximizing its capacity.

**Merits**  
- Energy-efficient with an eco-mode to save water and power.  
- Portable, requiring no installation, making it suitable for RVs and compact kitchens.  
- Touch-screen with 8 different wash cycles to cater to various dishwashing needs.  

[View HAVA TDJR09 sale info on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b0dms6821r/)

**Comprehensive Wash Programs**  
The dishwasher comes with eight wash options, and I’ve played with nearly all of them. The ""intensive"" cycle has become my go-to for pots and pans with stubborn grease, while the “rapid” one is perfect for mornings when I need a quick scrub-down for lighter loads. The heated drying feature ensures everything comes out spotless and nearly cabinet-ready—though a few sharper-edged cups needed a quick wipe to eliminate leftover water droplets.  

Its built-in water softener takes care of my hard water issue, which used to leave unsightly white streaks on glassware. After a few weeks of use, I noticed no limescale buildup in the unit, which speaks volumes about its efficiency.

**Noise Levels**  
At around 60 dB of noise during operation, this countertop appliance hums in the background without disrupting conversations or making me raise the volume on my TV. I’ve even left it running overnight without much worry. A small price to pay for quiet and effective convenience.

**Drawbacks**  
- Some utensils, like tall spatulas, can be a tight fit due to the interior layout.  
- Occasionally, the dishes on the upper rack don’t get as dry as items on the lower rack.  
- The hose connections sometimes feel a bit loose; I wish they had a firmer locking mechanism.  

**Other Options**  
Compared to other countertop models like the BLACK+DECKER Compact Dishwasher or the Farberware Portable Countertop Dishwasher, this unit stands out for its built-in water tank and the child lock feature—a necessity in homes with curious toddlers. Where other models require direct plumbing, making them less portable, this one offers the flexibility to move between spaces like dorms or RVs. Additionally, while some competing models match the price point, HAVA’s adjustable dish rack design makes better use of limited interior space.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Though the price is mid-range for portable dishwashers, I feel the energy-saving features and high functionality justify the investment. Saving water compared to handwashing dishes underscores its value for frugal, eco-conscious users like me. Appliances in this category, especially those without installation requirements, usually cost the same or more without offering features like a built-in water softener and delay-start options.

1mwj9tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/uichicago/comments/1mwj9tv/uic_advice_if_you_need_it_by_someone_who_made_all/,UIC advice if you need it - By someone who made all the mistakes.,"Hello UIC People:

I've had a lot of ups and downs in my first year. Family emergencies, mental heath episodes, club drama, psych ward 72 hour holds, etc. So as I sit here eating my meal in the dining hall, I'm just gonna try and say as much advice about here as I can to first years - but also some people who may not know some tips and tricks. I will go from top priority to least.

Taking care of yourself and others:  
\- 1) Give your all at work, never give your all TO work.   
I got straight As many semesters as well as juggling a URA (undergraduate Research Assistant) and being involved in competitive sports. People thought I was a very accomplished student - let alone in my first year. Wrong, because since I did all that I crashed, burned, and sent my ass straight to a psych ward. You work to live, not live to work. Always git it your best shot, but never really give anything your all in a literal sense. I was always a hard worker, but never sacrifice your sleep, eating, and especially time for you to grow and be yourself.   
\- 2) Everyone ESPECIALLY STEM MAJORS. SHOWER. EAT. SLEEP. DEODORANT.   
  
Some of y'alls nasty asses are so bad we put showers in the new buildings now. (Wish that was a joke, there is one outside the cafe in the new CS building cuz we stink.)  
  
\-3) SHUT THE FUCK UP IN LECTURE  
My biggest pet peeve on campus. We PAID to be here, you are wasting everyone's time and money chit chatting away in lecture. If you need to talk somebody, do it in the hall or whisper. I can never understand why people go to class AND JUST TALK. DO THAT SHIT OUTSIDE.

Classes/Professors:  
\- 1) Network, rate my professors, and grade distribution is key.   
At UIC we publish the grades of every class online, all you need to do is google and sign in with your UIC credentials. This is a good sign to see which teachers are more lenient with grading than others - especially good if there are multiple sections of the same class. Do this in conjunction with Rate My Professor Scores, and pay special attention to those in detail as it shows people put more effort into it. Sadly, RMP does not have any verification methods for their reviews so someone could be lying or even using a bot to spam bad or good reviews. If you can then, ask around the school/class about what teachers you should get. For me, I would walk around the CS lounge for CS professor recommendations. Just know there also could be a bit of bias there too: Ex, most teachers are going to say ""They are both good options"" if you compare two teachers in front of them.

\-2 ) Spend some time to walk around campus a the day or days before school starts.   
This way you will know where most of the classes are without rushing to class out of your mind.

\-3) If you do miss class / switch classes your first year here, no one really cares.   
We all planned for some hiccups whether it be missing the first day of class, needing to switch courses around, etc. Every single class has a 2 week grace period where you can figure out what your schedule looks like and if you like the class. Speaking of resources...

\-4) Don't buy all your books now. Keep a few hundos until the first few days.  
Teachers will provide all your resources the first two weeks of school - again, we give grace for the first two weeks. Teachers will also say the first day straight up you need XYZ. Don't go out and get this specific book with a specific edition instantly when you could wait and the professor could say ""I have a PDF"" of it. Example: I took calc 2 first semester, and my teacher suggested we go to the bookstore and ask for a discount so the Pearson book guy across the cashier could activate the code. I saved $80 just by waiting. 

\-5) You're gonna mess up, and that's ok!  
I know a lot of people who failed classes, had to drop out, me specifically I had to change my major. Embrace it! Everyone wants to hear the rags to riches story than the super senior who realized their passion for engineering after 4 years of art but chose to ignore it, and now is in a bunch of debt and is their 7th year here. Not saying you are bad if you are the latter, but best to figure and mess up stuff now than later.

Food  
\- 1) Go to the dining hall frequently, and take advantage of the box program   
Especially if you don't have a job, you will save yourself a lot of dish cleaning, money, time, and all the above if you dine on campus. There is also a reusable container program. If you hand the cashier $18, they will give you a reusable container to fill up your food with and leave. Then, you can put it inside a kiosk to get a coin, give to the cashier, and repeat the process. UIC is a really sustainable school, especially in regards to carbon footprint and food waste. Take advantage and get yourself an extra meal or save in case you got too much!  
\-2) Frequent coffee drinkers? Get the app.  
If you are rushing to class, get a Dunkin or Starbucks app and skip the line. That way you can just go to the shelf, grab and go vs the other students fighting in line to get their coffees. 

\-3) Don't get Panda Express  
They increased their prices by a few dollars the past few years, and they have less than a 2 star rating on google. Avoid the food poisoning. 

Transportation  
\- 1) Consider public transport  
I am a resident every school year and a commuter in the summers. Those who drive on the I-90 Edens can attest everyone drives on it like fucking MarioKart. Plus, UIC parking is in the thousands of dollars. If you can, pick up a UPASS for a $120 or if you live really far UPASS+ for a bit more. UPASS is CTA, while UPASS+ is Metra and CTA. Pace is only if you purchase credit yourself. I personally must have saved $500 this summer by taking public transport. 

\- 2) Be smart about where you park.  
UIC isn't too big like Urbana, or small like NLU. You don't want to park on the other side of the campus, then realize your class is on the exact opposite side. 

\-3) Bike riders, GET THE BEST LOCKS YOU CAN  
My bike got stolen the second week of class. And yes IT WAS LOCKED AND I HAD A U LOCK. The U Lock was cheap, so it broke down. I had a backup cable lock, and that got snapped and the thief got away with my bike. Now I have a cable and a hella good U-Lock. They are basically giant locks made of steel that lock onto your bike.

Working on campus/Getting a job past school/Research:  
\-1) Handshake is a scam.   
Unless you were told specifically by a recruiter or someone at the workplace you need to go through Handshake, it's basically a glorified LinkedIn for colleges. Not useful unless someone explicitly mentioned it to shoot your shot.

\-2) Networking is key.  
The reason why I was able to become a Research Assistant my first year is because my teacher was the lab supervisor after I saw a poster board of his team on the symposium. Unless you already have connections to a researcher here Ex: I used to be a RA at Loyola/NLU/NW/similar colleges, that professor knows this other professor here at UIC. 

\-3) Consider Honors College  
I know so many people who are so polar opposite about Honors College. Some students are like I love it so much it has helped with my professional and academic journey! And some are saying a glorified NHS. As a former VP for NHS and current Honors College Student I would say the following: If you are doing Study Abroad, Research, or Graduate School. Do Honors College. They are an amazing network of students and faculty who will raise you in those regards. Without Honors College, I would have not been able to be a research assistant - let alone in my first semester here. However, if you are looking for scholarships, professional networking outside graduate school, or not like what the mandatory courses they offer for students are - then it will be a waste of time. Most engineers for example won't benefit from Honors College unless they want to do research under a certain professor. In fact, me and a couple of engineers I met are in Honors College - compared to the dozens of others who said no.

Making friends  
\- 1) Just talk whenever you have the chance.   
People in your classes - talk. (Unless lecture is happening, which in that case STFU). You like reading, sports, martial arts, etc? Probably a club for that. Join the clubs there! Yes UIC is mainly a commuter school and people get in and out quick, but there are a lot of people who live and breathe on campus. I know I do being involved in so many things + dorming. Anyone can shoot me a text and hmu anytime. 

And I think that's all? At least I have at the moment. Please HMU if you guys have any more questions! I gotta go to work again

It ended horriblly after a number of large verbal fights. And eventually led to my mental breakdown, during the first stages of the break up she would consistently send call and video chat requests to me. 
Not to talk rationally but to continue arguing, dispite her knowing I was in a mental crisis. 

It took me years to recover but I havent been in a full timer relationship since, deep down im scared of repeating the trauma. 

Anyways, 2 weeks ago we matched on tinder (she has been abroad since we separated). I reached out first to wish her all the best and to suggest a coffee meet to catch up.

This has brought up so many memories of out relationship, and for the first time in years im longing for again. 

Ive reflected on this a lot the last 2 weeks, and now realise that im actually longing for companionship and a partner not specifically her. I think my mind automatically pictures her as a default partner when im lonely. 

To make things worse, im on a journey of quiting weed after 15 years 10 of which was daily use. Currently on day 51 💪

Has anyone else experienced something like this ? How did you cope with the renewed feelings of longing and nostalgia? ",1,1755801154.0,lonely,4,0.67,False

1mwj6je,https://www.reddit.com/r/HacksAndRiddles/comments/1mwj6je/why_hackers_dont_even_bother_hacking_anymore/,Why Hackers Don’t Even Bother Hacking Anymore,"I just stumbled on [this](https://www.cybersecurity-insiders.com/from-dark-web-to-jackpot-how-cybercriminals-exploit-stolen-credentials-in-igaming/) gem of an article by Artem Bychkov from [SOFTSWISS](https://www.softswiss.com/), and honestly—it reads like a how-to guide for the lazy hacker of the future. Forget about zero-days or Hollywood-style hacks. Today’s cybercrime is powered by one thing: logging in.



Here’s the gist: credential stuffing is the perfect lazy man’s attack. Hackers scoop up leaked usernames and passwords from data dumps, dump them on the dark web, and then spray them across platforms until someone logs in. And lo and behold, they do—because people still use the same password from their early Facebook days on everything from forums to financial apps.



The real magic, though, isn’t the hack—it’s the economy behind it. The dark web has turned stolen credentials into a retail product. Want account credentials? There’s a shop for that. Full browser sessions, screenshots, tokens—you name it, they’ve got it—for the price of a cup of coffee. Reviews, refunds, seller ratings—it’s all disturbingly organized.



Bychkov’s point is sharp: credential stuffing preys on laziness and weak security. Platforms and users both drop the ball by treating passwords like disposable trinkets. And let’s not forget the rise of infostealer malware, quietly siphoning cookies, tokens, and screenshots off your device so hackers don’t even need your password—they have everything they need.



And yet, companies seem asleep at the wheel. MFA is often a polite suggestion, not a requirement. Dark web monitoring is still optional. And users? They’re still using the same password as their childhood diary entries.



If this trend doesn’t set off alarms, nothing will. Hackers don’t need to work hard—they just wait for the next dump, run a script, cash in.



So here’s the burning question: are you using a unique password, or do you like giving hackers an easy payday?

So i continually tried methods of loss I hated and then didn't stick to them. I gained and lost \~60lb 3 times before I decided to just do what worked for me, no matter how weird it was. I finally lost and maintained. Here is what worked:

0. I firmly believe that weight loss for women doesn't happen in the kitchen or on the sports field. It happens in therapy. Unpacking my shame over doing things in a 'weird' or the 'wrong' way and my shame at listening to my body helped more than any other advice I read here. I learned to see regaining weight as a sign that i had more to discover about my body and just hadn't found what worked for me yet, rather than a failure. After 3 gain and loss cycles, i managed to maintain because I started sticking to habits that brought me joy. I'm now an expert on my body. Instead of weight loss being about fixing a failure, make it about finding what works for you and makes your soul sing.

1. I am a 5'4"" overweight woman with PCOS, IR, and chronic illness. Reddit advice was consistently inaccurate for me. For instance, the commonly repeated mantra of ""CICO is the ONLY answer and if you don't lose with a 500cal deficit you're DOING IT WRONG, MEASURE HARDER"" ignores context and mountains of science. While it's true that some kind of a calorie deficit is required, what your body is doing metabolically with that deficit and whether you can reasonably and joyfully maintain that deficit matters way more.

To lose weight with severe Insulin resistance I had to consume starvation levels of calories which is dangerous and just isn't reasonable when I'm out living life, and more importantly it's unnecessary. 44% of the US has some level of insulin resistance. If you have PCOS you are almost definitely in that category. I had to resolve the insulin resistance first. Once i did, weight loss was 10x easier and felt more natural. MAKE your doctors do their job and then do what works for YOU.

2. I learned that movement should feel natural and fun. It should feel good and result in a small 'high' afterwards. Sometimes now i even get a small high during. If this isn't happening, it's probably why you hate to move. Something is wrong. MAKE your doctors do their job. Then find what works for you.

3. I didn't want to feel hunger or otherwise uncomfortable while I lost. So I figured out how to do not feel that. If you don't want to feel hunger while you lose, don't.

4. For me, the research supports that consuming meals that are 400-450cal, \~25-35g protein, 10-30g net carbs, 8-15g fiber, and a little fat should be satiating. If you eat your equivalent and still feel hungry, something is wrong. Fix that first. This equates to \~ a fistful of protein, a fistful of starch, and 2 fistfuls of green vegetables + sauce fyi.

5. If you hate daily calorie counting, don't. (seriously). My weight loss started once I'd given up counting. I found a way of eating that brought me joy, and a way of moving that I was happy to stick to. The rest came out in the wash and now i'm just sorry i wasted so much time and energy doing things i hated.

6. If you need a metric to motivate you, that's ok! Looking in the mirror, measuring your waist, standing on a scale, tracking how you feel every day, counting how many times you smile per week... All of these are valid. Or do none of these things. I solely track how i feel and how much energy I have. If i eat more than I need i feel sluggish and blegh. I notice that the following day I naturally want to eat less and move more. **This is how it should feel**. Do what works for you.

7. If you primarily want to lose weight for aesthetic reasons, that's ok. If you want to feel healthy and energetic and lose no weight, that's ok too - it's your life and your body. Do What Works for You.

8. If you hate walking - Don't. If you hate exercise or find it tough to stick to a routine, that's ok. Use the time and energy you'd otherwise be using to beat yourself up over not exercising to try new forms of movement until you find one you love and do it until you want to stop. Make your journey about finding all the things you love or about creating experiences you remember.

I remember the time i lost spectacularly at pickleball. The time i sat behind a waterfall with a friend. The time i impulse decided to captain a frisbee team of my friends and we lost every game. Those were all forms of movement but the point was to chase the experience. I don't even remember my ""failures"".

I learned that I love swimming holes. I love gentle lifting with weight machines. I love novelty. I love hikes with interesting or beautiful destinations. I love gardening.

I hate running sports. I hate boring hikes. I hate heavy lifting with bars. I hate walking. I hate exercise classes. I hate ""going"" to a gym. I f'ing hate yoga. So i don't do those things.

Once i stopped trying to force myself to do what I hated I found i could fill my time with something I loved and i had the mental energy to stick to it. I do it on days I want to do it and don't on days I don't. Guess what? It worked. Do what works for you.

9. Start to unpack your resistance to doing things ""wrong"". This was the single most impactful advice I followed. It took me years to sustain an exercise routine because I thought lifting 15 min and only with machines was ""wrong"". I was ashamed that i couldn't jog for 10 minutes without stopping, and that i need breaks every minute. I thought the only valid exercise was one that came with a ""routine"" that I ""completed"" or I was a ""failure"".

I still can't jog for more than a minute or too without a break, chronic illness sucks, but that's ok. I did what worked for me and found a whole new set of activities i loved.

10. There is nothing wrong, shameful, unfair, cheating or otherwise about any form of medication or supplementation to reach your goals. We in the modern english-speaking world live in a heavily puritan culture centered on shame and sacrifice. If it works for you, DO IT. Nobody gets this up in arms about heart medication lmao.

11. I hate traditional meal prepping or spending lots of time in the kitchen. This made me not cook. So instead I started prioritized quick meals with finger foods because I enjoy eating those.

I also came up with 10 or so balanced (protein+fiber+fat+starch) recipes that are 30min or less end to end (with dishes). I pair everything with a sauce.

I use a veggie steamer that sits on top of my rice cooker and throw some pre-made protein on top with a sauce when it's done. My pressure cooker makes shredded chicken from a frozen thigh in <20 min. While i'm shredding it cooks the rice. ONE DISH. Your girl is LAZY and proud of it.

I fill bento boxes with easily grabbable healthy snacks. (One part of the bento box is always the sauce, your girl loves bougie). I eat these in front of the TV after work (bring on the hate, haters). Does that make me childish? I don't care. I have fully embraced girl dinner.

I eat a lot of salmon, tuna, hardboiled eggs (i LOVE my egg genie), berries, fruit, broccoli, carrots, cucumbers, pre-cooked chicken strips, lentil paddies, tempeh, and nuts. All of those easily fit in a bento box. All are anti-inflammatory ( which is helpful for PCOS )

Sweet Chili garlic hummus with lentil paddies or tempeh dipped in is BOMBIN'. Coffee yogurt slaps.

I consume bougie salad kits like it's my job. I love everything that i eat. Ultimately I found that when i stopped forcing my body to eat things it didn't want, food stopped rotting uneaten in the fridge, my grocery bill plummeted and i had more mental space and energy and desire to maintain a healthy diet \[and there is science to support all of this\]. Grocery shopping is much easier now too.

I slowly migrated into an eating pattern full of nutrient dense, balanced, fresh and tasty foods I actually like because they weren't hidden behind all the rotten food i didn't actually want and i wasn't so stressed swimming through a seat of shame that i was craving carbs.

I spent time in therapy unpacking WHY i felt so much shame for eating like a toddler.

It worked for me. Meal prepping works for others. Do what works for you.

12. I still eat desert sometimes. However, i also use inositol prior to eating it and i eat it after fiber and protein. I will probably always have to do this bc PCOS, but it's a habit I can stick to because I feel so much better when I do it and the rest of my life contains so much joy.

tl;dr Living like a toddler worked for me. What are your finger food favorites?",8,1755800850.0,WeightLossAdvice,7,0.91,False

My eyes fluttered closed and the sounds of the busy café washed over me. The smell of burnt bacon lingered in the air as I leant against the counter waiting for Dave, the fry cook, to finish plating up the order for table seven. I could have done with not working today, if I was honest. I’d been bartending at my local pub until just before midnight last night, so the five o’clock wake-up to come and serve food to hungry patrons wasn’t something that I needed. Right now it was the mid-morning brunch rush at the greasy spoon café that I worked at, so I still had another three hours to work before I could go home and wash the fried lard smell out of my hair. My tiredness was only going to get worse as the day went on. The thing was, as a mother of a five year old child, my duties didn’t even stop once I clocked off.  
  
  “Order up,” Dave announced, setting down four plates onto the serving counter.  
  
  Without speaking, I slipped my foot back into my shoe and picked up the orders, balancing the four plates along my arms. I sighed deeply, pushed myself away from the counter and struggled across the busy café towards the table. As I got halfway to the desired table, a pinch to my behind had me gasping and whirling in shock, almost dropping the customers’ food all over the floor.  
  
  “We’re ready to order when you are, little darlin’,” Rex purred, winking at me.  
  
  I forced a polite smile even though I wanted to grab the greasy fry-up I was holding and shove it into his face. Rex was a regular; he also left a nice tip, so I couldn’t afford to be rude to him. “Sure thing, I’ll be right back,” I replied, sidestepping his hand that was dangerously close to my backside.!  
  
  He smiled his predatory smile and I tried not to cringe at his teeth – permanently stained a yellowy-brown colour because of too much coffee and smoking. Before he could say anything else or flirt with me again, I turned on my heel and delivered the food to the waiting family in my section.  
  
  After a round of pleasantries and telling them if they needed anything to call me, I headed back to Rex’s table and tried not to act like I would rather be shovelling horses’ poop than working here. Rex was with his brother and his friend today, they all had the same flirtatious smiles on their faces as I stopped at their table and pulled out my order pad.  
  
  “What can I get you today?” I asked, trying not to let any of the frustration leak into my voice. I put on a smile, pretending that I didn’t resent waiting tables in a pink uniform that was made from cheap, scratchy polyester, and that I didn’t think I had wasted my life.  
  
  Instantly I was pulled down into the booth next to Rex and his heavy arm slung across my shoulders as he smiled at me. “When you gonna accept my offer to take you out, Bronwyn?”  
  
  I laughed and secretly tried not to envision grabbing his face and smashing it onto the table. “I’m married, Rex. Not gonna accept any time soon. Maybe you should stop asking?” I suggested.  
  
  He grinned and shook his head confidently. “Nah, one day I’ll ask and you’ll say yes.”  
  
  Yeah, and one day pigs might grow wings and fly off! “So, what can I get you guys today?” I repeated, pushing his arm off me and standing up, straightening my awful pink uniform.  
  
  Rex sighed, and the guys he was with reeled off their orders to me one at a time. I really wasn’t in the mood for this today. I shouldn’t have even been at work today at all, Fridays were my day off from the café because I worked at the pub on Wednesday and Thursday nights, but a shift had come up this morning and I’d needed the money too badly to refuse.  
  
  After I’d put their order in to the cook, I smiled at Marina and motioned with my head that I was going to take my break. On the way through to the back room, I poured myself a strong black coffee and then almost fell onto the uncomfortable iron chairs because I was exhausted. It just seemed never-ending; every day was so long that, by the time I got home, all I wanted to do was go to bed. That couldn’t happen though, I had responsibilities after all. No one ever told me that life was supposed to be this hard; even if they did I’m sure I would have thought they were exaggerating.  
  
  While I sipped my coffee, my mobile phone buzzed in my apron pocket. I frowned and pulled it out, hoping it wasn’t going to be Finn, my husband, telling me that he was going out gambling with his friends again tonight. I was pleasantly surprised to see my mum’s picture on my screen.  
  
  “All right, Mum?” I greeted, taking another sip from my mug, letting the caffeine seep into my system.  
  
  “Bronwyn, guess what?!” she chirped without even saying hello.  
  
  I raised one eyebrow, curious about what had put her in such a happy mood. “What?”  
  
  “You’re now an auntie!” she practically screamed.  
  
  My body jerked as my heart leapt in my chest. A little squeal escaped my lips at the news that my older sister had given birth. “Oh my God! What did she have? When? Is Skye OK? What time, weight?” I jumped from my seat, grinning from ear to ear. It was a little early for this, Skye was only just over eight months pregnant, but they had told her she was carrying low last time she went for her midwife appointment.  
  
  “Little girl. She went into labour in the early hours of this morning, but there were some complications, so she had to go down for an emergency caesarean. She’s such a dear little thing; she’s only six pounds and two ounces. They’ve called her Evie Lou. Skye’s awake already and laughing so she’s all good too.”  
  
  A happy sigh left my lips at the news. “Evie Lou Hanklin,” I tested out the name. “I love it!”  
  
  My mum giggled like a giddy little girl. “I know, it’s perfect!” she agreed. “So, when are you coming? They’re going to be in the hospital for a few days at least. Why don’t you all come stay with me for a couple of days? I haven’t seen you and Theo for months.”  
  
  My mind was already whirling with thoughts of that. I had to go there as soon as possible, visit the baby and give my big sister a hug. But that meant I had to get tomorrow off work at the café. It shouldn’t be too hard though, after all, it was extenuating circumstances. It wasn’t every day that your big sister gave birth to a baby that she’d been trying for five years for.  
  
  “That sounds great. I’ll definitely come tonight. What time’s visiting?” I could barely wait. My heart ached with happiness and excitement. Being an auntie was something I was going to kick arse at for sure. I loved kids.  
  
  “Seven until nine.”  
  
  I nodded, committing it to memory. “I’m so excited I can barely stand still!” I laughed at myself and bit into my bottom lip. “I’d better go call Finn and get things arranged. I’ll speak to you later and see you tonight up the hospital.” I ignored the distasteful little sound my mum made in the back of her throat at the mention of my husband’s name.  
  
  “Bye, Bronwyn, see you soon.”  
  
  My coffee and the much-needed caffeine boost were long forgotten as I practically skipped out to speak to Dave. I was going to need to flutter my eyelashes a lit  
tle to get the day off tomorrow.  
  
  As I leant on the counter and grinned over at him, he looked up at me and raised one eyebrow in question. “What you giving me that sweet smile for? You can’t have another advance on your wages; you’re already two weeks ahead. Sorry, Bron,” he said, shaking his head apologetically.  
  
  I grinned happily; nothing was bringing my happy mood down right now. “No, no, I don’t want an advance,” I assured him. “My mum just called. Skye had her baby!” I chirped excitedly. He grinned too. “I really need to go there. I’m supposed to be working the morning shift tomorrow. Is there some way I could get the day off so that I can stay over with my mum?” I asked, pleading with my eyes. Dave was a bit of a soft touch, so I was praying that the begging would work.  
  
  He sighed and rubbed the back of his neck. “I need a waitress.”  
  
  I winced. “What if I asked someone else to cover?” I begged.  
  
  He frowned and then rolled his eyes. “As long as I have a waitress then I don’t care who comes in and who doesn’t. Just sort it out amongst yourselves then, all right?”  
  
  I squealed and nodded, immediately grabbing my mobile and calling Karen to ask her to trade shifts with me, tomorrow for Sunday instead. It took a little convincing, but finally she agreed, so I was now free to go.  
  
  Next, I put in a call to Finn to tell him the good news. “Hey, buttercup,” he greeted as he answered. The sounds of a video game in the background only meant one thing – that he was round his friend Doug’s place. I sighed. Sometimes, Finn was like an overgrown man-child.  
  
  “Hey, where are you?” I enquired, leaning up against the wall of the staff room.  
  
  He laughed. “You keeping tabs on me again? I’ll be home later, don’t you worry about that,” he replied, skilfully deflecting my question.  
  
  I sighed and closed my eyes. I hated my life. It was so hard not to resent Finn, it really was. I was holding down two jobs, on my feet all day practically every day, and yet he was still ‘looking for a new job’ after he got laid off a couple of months ago. I knew jobs were hard to find, I knew that he tried, but that didn’t stop me from getting angry with him that he was sitting at his friend’s house fooling around instead of doing something practical. Even just something small like running the hoover around our small, tired flat would take some of the pressure off me. But no, things like that didn’t happen.  
  
  “Skye had her baby. A little girl. She’s called her Evie,” I announced.  
  
  Finn, as I expected, wasn’t overly bothered by the sound of his response. “That’s nice.” He was still playing the game in the background; I could hear guns blazing and Doug shouting things at the TV.  
  
  I frowned, trying not to let him ruin my happy mood. “Yeah. So, can you go home and pack up some overnight things for the three of us? That’ll save some time. I finish work at half past two so I’ll go pick up Theo from school, and you can meet us just outside the school gates. I’ll snag us some food to eat in the car. It shouldn’t take more than an hour and a half to get there.”  
  
  “What, car, what you talking about?” he asked, now obviously tuning in to what I was saying.  
  
  I sighed deeply. “Visiting hours start at seven tonight. Mum said we could stay at hers for a couple of days, but I’ve just switched shifts with Karen so I need to be back here for Sunday morning. We can stay there tonight though and then drive back tomorrow or something,” I explained.  
  
  “That sounds like a great plan,” Finn replied. I smiled and nodded, but the smile fell from my face as he continued, “But I’ve been drinking so I can’t drive.”  
  
  My heart sank. “You’ve been drinking? Seriously? It’s not even lunchtime!” I stated incredulously.  
  
  “I’ve only had two beers, but I’ll be over the limit. I can’t drive. Plus, I have plans tonight anyway,” he answered.  
  
  I scowled down at the floor at the word ‘plans’. I didn’t need him to tell me what his ‘plans’ were, I would bet last week’s pay cheque that it involved him getting drunk, losing money at cards and, if he was drunk enough, sleeping with some slut who happened to look in his direction. I tried to keep my cool and not shout at him. I was used to things like this; he’d been cheating on me with anything that moved for the last four years. At this point, I genuinely couldn’t care less. I was with him because I didn’t want to be on my own and because Theo deserved a dad.  
  
  Of course, I’d broken it off once. Three years ago I got it into my head that I didn’t deserve to be treated like that, and I’d left him. I was strong for a while, and Theo and I coped on our own for almost a month. Then the unthinkable happened. One night, while Theo and I slept, a man broke into the poky little flat that we lived in. I’d woken to find him raiding my living room, looking for cash or anything that he could pawn to buy drugs if looking at him was anything to go by. He hadn’t hurt us; he’d actually looked just as startled as I had felt when I stumbled upon him with my handbag in his hand and my mother’s china figurine in the other. He’d run out of there as fast as his legs could carry him, barely getting away with anything – but that encounter had struck a deep terror into my heart because I knew, deep down, that if he’d wanted to hurt us, he could have done. If hurting us had been his intention, I would have been powerless to stop him. I hadn’t slept right for days after; nightmares of me being unable to protect my defenceless young baby plagued my mind. That was when I made the decision that I regretted almost every day – I took Finn back. But, admittedly, having a man there at night time gave me that safe feeling back that I so desperately needed after seeing someone force their way into my home. Having Finn there kept me and my son safe, and stopped me worrying about things that would have played on my mind otherwise.  
  
  There was no longer any love between us; hell, we barely even tolerated each other at times. Sometimes I even struggled to remember what it was that I saw in him the first place. Usually I convinced myself that it was his looks that I fell for, though even those had lost their appeal to me because I knew he’d rather be off sleeping with other girls than me. Ours was a marriage of convenience, even though it was inconvenient most of the time. Another reason I was with him was because I didn’t have the energy to find anyone else. I’d been young when we’d gotten together, merely seventeen, and I knew that the dating scene had moved on pretty rapidly since I was last a part of it. In my opinion, I was too old to be single again, so I’d just have to suffer and grin and bear it. Many women went through their lives in an unhappy marriage. I was no different to any of them. Not everyone found their Mr Darcy and lived happily ever after, some people just had to take what they could get and be thankful. Clearly I was one of those people.  
  
  “But I need to go there tonight. That’s my sister and my niece,” I grumbled, kicking the toe of my shoe against the wall in anger.  
  
  Finn sighed dramatically. “If you really have to go there tonight then take a train or something. It’s a waste of bloody money but just do what you want. I guess I can cancel my plans and have Theo.”  
  
  I recoiled, shocked at his words. He never usually did anything for me, but now he was offering to cancel his plans and stay home with our son? “Seriously?” I hadn’t considered a train, but I could easily do that.  
  
  “Yeah, whatever. You’ve been banging on about this baby for months. I honestly can’t take the pouting and whining you’ll do if you don’t get to go there. I’ll get the blame all night long because I had a couple of beers to unwind.”  
  
  I smiled weakly. So he wasn’t suggesting that I go for me, he was suggesting that I go because I’d be complaining and blaming him if I didn’t. Typical Finn, something that benefitted him again.  
  
  “Will you come tomorrow and pick me up? Bring Theo so he can see my mum?” I asked hopefully. My mum would be upset if she didn’t get to see her grandson too.  
  
  He groaned loudly. “Can’t you just buy a return ticket?”  
  
  “Finn, please?” I begged. “My mum would love to see you two.” That wasn’t strictly true, she would probably rather not see F  
inn. “Please? If you come and pick me up in the morning we can spend the day down there or something?” Finn’s relationship with my family wasn’t exactly a good one – they were amicable enough, but it was a polite front that they all kept up. My parents had never thought he was good enough for me after he accidentally got me pregnant when I was seventeen. When my father had died two years ago of cancer, Finn hadn’t even bothered to go and say a final goodbye, and had been drunk at his funeral. That hadn’t gone down well and would probably never be forgotten.  
  
  “Ugh, fine! I’ll spend three bloody hours in a car tomorrow, just to see your flippin’ family, does that make you happy?”  
  
  I gritted my teeth in frustration. “Yes, actually,” I admitted. “Thank you.” Silence rang out as I struggled to find something to say to diffuse the tension. My happy mood was now gone. “I’d better go see about a bus ticket or something. Make sure you pick up Theo from school at half past three because I won’t be here to do it.” I frowned, praying he wouldn’t forget to pick up our son. “And don’t drink any more if you’re going to be in charge of him,” I added as an afterthought.  
  
  “I’ll be there. Call me later.” He hung up before I even got to answer and drum into him how important it was for him to arrive at the school on time. Deep down, I knew that Finn would be there on time – although he was a terrible husband, he actually wasn’t a bad dad.  
  
  By the time I finished my shift, cleared my section after a particularly rowdy group of teenagers had been in, and clocked out, it was past three in the afternoon. I was now running late. The train that I needed to catch to Bath left in just over half an hour – and I hadn’t even packed yet.  
  
  After a mad dash home, I threw a few things into a bag, and then scribbled a note for Finn telling him that I’d put some beef casserole into the fridge from the café for them to have for dinner. After I’d written my note, I practically ripped off my work uniform and changed into jeans and a black, stretch t-shirt. Before leaving my flat, I headed over to the food cupboard, going up on tiptoes and reaching into the back. My hand closed around the jar of money that I kept there. As soon as I picked it up and heard the pitiful tinkle of the change in the bottom of the jar, I knew something wasn’t right. When it came into view, I groaned. It was supposed to be our emergency money, something I put into each week from my wages in case something went wrong. It looked as though Finn had had a few emergencies and had neglected to tell me.  
  
  After unscrewing the top and tipping the meagre contents out onto the kitchen counter, I counted out thirty-seven pounds and seventy-two pence. I’d already been told over the phone when I called about the trains that it was forty two pounds for an off-peak ticket from Paddington to Bath. I ground my teeth, picking up the crumpled notes and change, shoving it into my purse, before stomping over to the sofa and thrusting my hand down the back of  the cushions, looking for anything that might have dropped out of a pocket by accident. I needed another five pounds for the train ticket. The clock on the wall suddenly caught my eye and I gasped. If I didn’t leave this very second, I wouldn’t even need to worry about being short on cash because I’d miss the train.  
  
  After swinging my overnight bag onto my shoulder and picking up my handbag, I ran the whole way to the station. Sweat trickled down my back by the time I arrived. The whole time I’d been running, I’d kept my eyes peeled on the floor, searching for any cash or change that someone might have accidentally dropped. Just my luck though, it seemed that the streets were clean for once.  
  
  Once I got to Paddington station, I got in the queue to buy the ticket from an actual person rather than the automated machine. My mouth was dry as I tried my best to come up with an excuse why I didn’t have enough money to pay. This was going to be embarrassing, to say the least. I gulped as I got to the front; the haughty-looking woman eyed me expectantly as I stepped forward. As I expected, when she rang my fare through the price was forty-two pounds exactly. I didn’t have enough.  
  
  Time to bring out the bad acting…  
  
  I opened my purse, pulling out the money I had, and then gasped, pretending to be shocked. “Damn it, I swear I had another ten in here,” I lied, shaking my head and pulling open all of the sections.  
  
  “Ma’am, do you want the ticket or not?” she asked with no compassion in her voice at all. She’d probably she’d seen this act thousands of times before.  
  
  I nodded eagerly. “Yeah, I really need the ticket. My sister just had a little baby, and I need to go and see them. I don’t get to see them very often; I need to get on that train. Is there some way you could let me off of the five quid?” I asked, looking at her pleadingly.  
  
  She sighed and shook her head. “It doesn’t work like that. My till would be wrong at the end of the day; I need all money accounted for. If I discounted your ticket I’d have to discount all the people in the queue,” she stated, waving her hand behind me for dramatic effect.  
  
  “Please? I really need to get on that train. Maybe I could drop in the other six quid tomorrow night when I get back?” I suggested. I would do it, I wasn’t one to lie.  
  
  She raised one eyebrow as if I had suggested something ridiculous, and I felt my heart sink as my eyes prickled with tears. I desperately wanted to see my sister and niece tonight. I didn’t want to be the last one to see her.  
  
  “Bronwyn?”  
  
  I turned curiously, wondering who had called my name. Rex stood there in his black security guard uniform with his little shiny gold badge pinned to his breast pocket. I smiled weakly. “Hi, Rex.” I’d forgotten he once told me he worked security at the station.  
  
  “Something wrong?” he asked, walking to my side and looking from me to the ticket lady.  
  
  “She doesn’t have enough to pay her fare,” the lady stated heartlessly.  
  
  Heat crept up my neck and over my cheeks because someone that I knew had witnessed my shameful attempt to beg my way onto the train. “I thought I had another ten in my purse, but Finn must have taken it or something. I’m just under five quid short,” I muttered, snapping the clasp of my purse shut angrily. I would just have to go tomorrow morning with Finn in the car; there was no alternative because I didn’t drive so I couldn’t get there any other way.  
  
  Rex smiled and shoved his hand in his pocket before holding out a ten pound note to me. “Here. Call it your tip for the next couple of weeks, huh?” he offered.  
  
  My heart leapt in my chest at the gesture. “Seriously?” I gasped as he pushed the money into my hand.  
  
  He nodded and smiled. “Seriously,” he confirmed.  
  
  My shoulders relaxed as I grinned in thanks, turning and sliding the total through to the lady at the ticket booth. “Oh God, thanks so much, Rex. I really, really appreciate it,” I gushed. Maybe he isn’t such a bad guy after all!  
  
  He laughed and pulled out a set of keys, unlocking the door to the ticket office. “No worries. Maybe next time I ask you out, you’ll consider it for a split second before you turn me down,” he joked. I laughed, knowing it wouldn’t happen because I was married. He winked at me playfully before heading into the ticket office and settling himself into a chair.  
  
  “Rex, you’re a star! Dessert is on me next time you come to the café, OK?” I grinned happily as the lady slid my ticket across to me. “Thanks again. See you next week!” I called over my shoulder as I sprinted for my platform.  
  
  The train ride was long, but luckily I had found a magazine on one of the empty seats so I kept myself amused by perusing that. To keep myself busy I made a call to Finn, double-checking that he’d picked up Theo and that he’d feed and bathe him before bed. He agreed to leave London the following morning early, so would be at my mum’s house a little after ten in the morning. That would give Theo a fair few hours with his grandmother.  
  
  When the train finally rolled to a stop, I couldn’t keep the ecstatic grin off my face. It felt nice to be going home. Bath was where I grew up as a kid. We all moved away when I was in my early teens, but in the last few years my sister and mother had moved back to be closer to other family members. I’d elected to stay in London with Finn. As I stepped out of the train and onto the platform with my overnight bag on my back, I wasn’t expecting to see my mother standing there with a huge grin on her face. My heart leapt into my throat as my eyes prickled with happy tears. It had been way too long since I’d seen that smile.

Except that more of them are dressed in the greys and blacks of widowhood, the aunts seem little changed since five years ago when Yolanda was last on the Island.  
  
  Sitting among the aunts in the less comfortable dining chairs, the cousins are flashes of color in turquoise jumpsuits and tight jersey dresses.  
  
  The cake is on its own table, the little cousins clustered around it, arguing over who will get what slice. When their squabbles reach a certain mother-annoying level, they are called away by their nursemaids, who sit on stools at the far end of the patio, a phalanx of starched white uniforms.  
  
  Before anyone has turned to greet her in the entryway, Yolanda sees herself as they will, shabby in a black cotton skirt and jersey top, sandals on her feet, her wild black hair held back with a hairband. Like a missionary, her cousins will say, like one of those Peace Corps girls who have let themselves go so as to do dubious good in the world.  
  
  A maid peeks out of the pantry into the hall. She is a skinny brown woman in the black uniform of the kitchen help. Her head is covered with tiny braids coiled into rounds and pinned down with bobby pins. “Doña Carmen,” she calls to Yolanda’s hostess aunt, “there are no matches. Justo went to Doña Lucinda’s to get some.”  
  
  “Por Dios, Iluminada,” Tía Carmen scolds, “you’ve had all day.”  
  
  The maid stares down at the interlaced hands she holds be-fore her, a gesture that Yolanda remembers seeing illustrated in a book for Renaissance actors. These clasped hands were on a page of classic gestures. The gesture of pleading, the caption had read. Held against the breast, next to the heart, the same interlaced hands were those of a lover who pleadeth for mercy from his beloved.  
  
  The gathering spots Yolanda. Her cousin Lucinda leads a song of greeting with an off-key chorus of little cousins. “Here she comes, Miss America!” Yolanda clasps her brow and groans melodramatically as expected. The chorus labors through the first phrase and then rushes forward with hugs, kisses, and—from a couple of the boys—fake karate kicks.  
  
  “You look terrible,” Lucinda says. “Too thin, and the hair needs a cut. Nothing personal.” She is the cousin who has never minced her words. In her designer pantsuit and frosted, blown-out hair, Lucinda looks like a Dominican magazine model, a look that has always made Yolanda think of call girls.  
  
  “Light the candles, light the candles!” the little cousins say, taking up a chant.  
  
  Tia Carmen lifts her open hands to heaven, a gesture she no doubt picked up from one of her priest friends. “The girl forgot the matches.”  
  
  “The help! Every day worse,” Tía Flor confides to Yolanda, flashing her famous smile. The cousins refer to their Tía Flor as “the politician.” She is capable of that smile no matter the circumstances. Once, the story goes, during who-knows-which revolution, a radical young uncle and his wife showed up at Tía Flor’s in the middle of the night wanting asylum. Tía Flor greeted them at the door with the smile and “How delightful of you to stop by!”  
  
  “Let me tell you about the latest at my house,” Tía Flor goes on. “The chauffeur was driving me to my novena yesterday. Suddenly the car jerks forward and dies, right there on the street. I’m alarmed, you know, the way things are, a big car stalled in the middle of the university barrio. I say, César, what can it be! He scratches his head. I don’t know, Doña Flor. A nice man stops to help, checks it all—and says, Why, señora, you’re out of gas. Out of gas! Can you imagine?” Tia Flor shakes her head at Yolanda. “A chauffeur who can’t keep a car in gasoline! Welcome home to your little Island!” Grinning, she flips open her fan. Beautiful wild birds unfold their silver wings.  
  
  At a proprietary yank from one of the little cousins, Yolanda lets herself be led to the cake table, festive with a lacy white tablecloth and starched party napkins. She dumb-shows surprise at the cake in the shape of the Island. “Mami thought of it,” Lucinda’s little girl explains, beaming.  
  
  “We’re going to light candles all over,” another little cousin adds. Her face has a ghostly resemblance to one of Yolanda’s generation. This one has to be Carmencita’s daughter.  
  
  “Not all over,” an older brother says, correcting her. “The candles are just for the big cities.”  
  
  “All over!” Carmencita’s reincarnation insists. “Right, Mami, all over?” She addresses a woman whose aging face is less familiar to Yolanda than the child’s facsimile.  
  
  “Carmencita!” Yolanda cries out. “I wasn’t recognizing you before.”  
  
  “Older, not wiser.” Carmencita’s quip in English is the product of her two or three years away in boarding school in the States. Only the boys stay for college. Carmencita continues in Spanish: “We thought we’d welcome you back with an Island cake!”  
  
  “Five candles,” Lucinda counts. “One for each year you’ve been away!”  
  
  “Five major cities,” the little know-it-all cousin calls out.  
  
  “No!” his sister contradicts. Their mother bends down to negotiate.  
  
  Yolanda and her cousins and aunts sit down to await the matches. The late sun sifts through the bougainvillea trained to climb the walls of the patio, to thread across the trellis roof, to pour down magenta and purple blossoms. Tía Carmen’s patio is the gathering place for the compound. She is the widow of the head of the clan and so hers is the largest house. Through well-tended gardens beyond her patio, narrow stone paths diverge. After cake and cafecitos, the cousins will disperse down these paths to their several compound houses. There they will supervise their cooks in preparing supper for the husbands, who will troop home after Happy Hour. Once a male cousin bragged that this pre-dinner hour should be called Whore Hour. He was not reluctant to explain to Yolanda that this is the hour during which a Dominican male of a certain class stops in on his mistress on his way home to his wife.  
  
  “Five years,” Tía Carmen says, sighing. “We’re going to have to really spoil her this time”—Tía cocks her head to imply collaboration with the other aunts and cousins—“so she doesn’t stay away so long again.”  
  
  “It’s not good,” Tía Flor says. “You four girls get lost up there.” Smiling, she indicates the sky with her chin.  
  
  “So how are you four girls!�  
�� Lucinda asks, a wink in her eyes. Back in their adolescent days during summer visits, the four girls used to shock their Island cousins with stories of their escapades in the States.  
  
  In halting Spanish, Yolanda reports on her sisters. When she reverts to English, she is scolded, “ien español!” The more she practices, the sooner she’ll be back into her native tongue, the aunts insist. Yes, and when she returns to the States, she’ll find herself suddenly going blank over some word in English or, like her mother, mixing up some common phrase. This time, however, Yolanda is not so sure she’ll be going back. But that is a secret.  
  
  “Tell us now exactly what you want to do while you’re here,” says Gabriela, the beautiful young wife of Mundín, the prince of the family. With the pale skin and dramatic dark eyes of a romantic heroine, Gabriela’s face reminds Yolanda of the lover’s clutch of hands over the breast. But, Gabriela herself is refreshingly straightforward. “If you don’t have plans, believe me, you’ll end up with a lot of invitations you can’t turn down.”  
  
  “Any little antojo, you must tell us!” Tía Carmen agrees.  
  
  “What’s an antojo” Yolanda asks.  
  
  See! Her aunts are right. After so many years away, she is losing her Spanish.  
  
  “Actually it’s not an easy word to explain.” Tía Carmen ex-changes a quizzical look with the other aunts. How to put it?  
  
  “An antojo is like a craving for something you have to eat.” Gabriela blows out her cheeks. “Calories.”  
  
  An antojo, one of the older aunts continues, is a very old Spanish word “from before your United States was even thought of,” she adds tartly. “In fact, in the countryside, you’ll still find some campesinos using the word in the old sense. Altagracia!” she calls to one of the maids sitting at the other end of the patio. A tiny, old woman, her hair pulled back tightly in a white bun, approaches the group of women. She is asked to tell Yolanda what an antojo is. She puts her brown hands away in her uniform pockets.  
  
  “U’té, que sabe,” Altagracia says in a small voice. You’re the one to know.  
  
  “Come now, Altagracia,” her mistress scolds.  
  
  The maid obeys. “In my campo we say a person has an antojo when they are taken over by un santo who wants something.” Altagracia backs away, and when not recalled, turns and heads back to her stool.  
  
  “I’ll tell you what my santo wants after five years,” Yolanda says. “I can’t wait to eat some guavas. Maybe I can pick some when I go north in a few days.”  
  
  “By yourself?” Tía Carmen shakes her head at the mere thought.  
  
  “This is not the States,” Tía Flor says, with a knowing smile. “A woman just doesn’t travel alone in this country. Especially these days.”  
  
  “She’ll be fine.” Gabriela speaks with calm authority. “Mundín will be gone if you want to borrow one of our cars.”  
  
  “Gabi!” Lucinda rolls her eyes. “Have you lost your mind? A Volvo in the interior with the way things are!”  
  
  Gabriela holds up her hands. “All right! All right! There’s also the Datsun.”  
  
  “I don’t want to put anyone out,” Yolanda says. She has sat back quietly, hoping she has learned, at last, to let the mighty wave of tradition roll on through her life and break on some other female shore. She plans to bob up again after the many don’ts to do what she wants. From the corner of her eye she sees Iluminada enter with a box of matches on a small silver tray. “I’ll take a bus.”  
  
  “A bus!” The whole group bursts out laughing. The little cousins, come forward to join the laughter, eager to be a part of the adult merriment. “Yolanda, mi amor, you have been gone long,” Lucinda teases. “Can’t you see it!?” She laughs. “Yoyo climbing into an old camioneta with all the campesinos and their fighting cocks and their goats and their pigs!”  
  
  Giggles and head shakings.  
  
  “I can take care of myself,” Yolanda reassures them. “But what’s this other trouble you keep mentioning?”  
  
  “Don’t listen to them.” Gabriela waves her hand as if scaring off an annoying fly. Her fingers are long and tapered; her wedding and engagement rings have been welded together into one thick band. “It’s easier this way,” she once explained, handing the ring over to Yolanda to try on.  
  
  “There have been some incidents lately,” Tía Carmen says in a quiet voice that does not brook contradiction. She, after all, is the reigning head of the family.  
  
  Almost as if to prove her point, a private guard, his weapons clicking, passes by on the side of the patio open to the back gardens. He wears an army-type khaki uniform, a gun swung over his shoulder. A tall wall has surrounded the compound for as far back as Yolanda can remember, a wall she believed as a child was there to keep the sea back in case during a hurricane it rose up to the hillside the family houses were built on.  
  
  “Things are looking ugly.” Tía Flor again smiles brightly. In the Renaissance book of acting, this grimace of a smile might be captioned, The lady is caught in a smile she cannot escape. “There’s talk, you know, of guerrillas in the mountains.”  
  
  Gabriela crinkles her nose. “Mundín says that talk is only talk.”  
  
  Iluminada has now crept forward to the edge of the circle to offer the matches to her mistress. In the fading light of the patio, Yolanda cannot make out the expression on the dark face.  
  
  Tía Carmen rises to approach the cake. She begins lighting candles and laying the spent matches on the tray Iluminada holds out to her. One light for Santo Domingo, one for Santiago, one for Puerto Plata. The children plead to be allowed to light the remaining cities, but no, Tía Carmen tells them, they may blow out the candles and, of course, eat the cake. Lighting is grownup business. Once the candles are all ablaze, the cousins and aunts and children gather around and sing a rousing “Bienvenida a ti,” to the tune of “Happy Birthday.”  
  
  Yolanda gazes at the cake. Below her blazes the route she has worked out on the map for herself, north of the city through the mountains to the coast. As the singing draws to a close, the cousins urge her to make a wish. She leans forward and shuts her eyes. There is so much she wants, it is hard to single out one wish. There have been too many stops on the road of the last twenty-nine years since her family left this island behind. She and her sisters have led such turbulent lives—so many husbands, homes, jobs, wrong turns among them. But look at her cousins, women with households and authority in their voices. Let this turn out to be my home, Yolanda wishes. She pictures the maids in their quiet, mysterious cluster at the end of the patio, Altagracia with her hands in her lap.  
  
  By the time she opens her eyes, ready, a half dozen little substitute puffs have blown out all the candles. There is a burst of clapping. Small arguments erupt over dividing the cake’s cities: Lucinda’s two boys both want Santiago since they went gliding there last weekend; Lucinda’s girl and Carmencita’s girl both insist on the capital because that’s where they were born, but one agrees to cede the capital if she can have La Romana, where the family has a beach house. But, of course, La Romana has already been spoken for by Tía Flor’s little goddaughter, who suffers from asthma and shouldn’t be contradicted. Lucinda, whose voice is hoarse with disciplining the rowdy crew, hands Yolanda the knife. “It’s your cake, Yoyo. You decide.”  
  
  The road up through the foothills is just wide enough for two small cars, and so at each curve, as she has been instructed, Yolanda slows and taps her horn. Just past one bad curve, a small shrine has been erected, La Virgen surrounded by three concrete crosses recently whitewashed.  
  
  She pulls the Datsun over and enjoys her first solitary moment since her arrival. Every compound outing has been hosted by one gracious aunt or another, presenting the landscape as if it were a floor show mounted for her niece’s appreciation.  
  
  All around her are the foothills, a dark enormous green, the sky more a brightness than a color. A breeze blows through the palms below, rustling their branches, so they whisper like voices. Here and there a braid of smoke rises up from a hillside—a campesino and his family living out their so  
litary life. This is what she has been missing all these years without really knowing that she has been missing it. Standing here in the quiet, she believes she has never felt at home in the States, never.  
  
  When she first hears it, she thinks it is her own motor she has forgotten to turn off, but the sound grows into a pained roar, as if the engine were falling apart. Yolanda makes out an undertow of men’s voices. Quickly, she gets into the car, locks the door, and pulls back onto the road, hugging her right side.  
  
  A bus comes lurching around the curve, obscuring her view. Belching exhaust, the driver saluting or warning with a series of blasts on his horn, it is an old army bus, the official name brushed over with paint that doesn’t quite match. The passengers see her only at the last moment, and all up and down her side of the bus, men poke out of the windows, hooting and yelling, holding out bottles and beckoning to her. She speeds up and leaves them behind, the quiet, well-oiled Datsun climbing easily up the snaky highway.  
  
  The radio is all static—like the sound of the crunching metal of a car; the faint, blurry voice on the airwaves her own, trapped inside a wreck, calling for help. In English or Spanish? she wonders. That poet she met at Lucinda’s party the night before argued that no matter how much of it one lost, in the midst of some profound emotion, one would revert to one’s mother tongue. He put Yolanda through a series of situations. What language, he asked, looking pointedly into her eyes, did she love in?  
  
  The hills begin to plane out into a high plateau, and the road widens. Left and right, roadside stands begin appearing. Yolanda keeps an eye out for guavas. Piled high on wooden stands are fruits Yolanda hasn’t seen in years: pinkish-yellow mangoes, and tamarind pods oozing their rich sap, and small cashew fruits strung on a rope to keep them from bruising each other. Strips of meat, buzzing with flies, hang from the windows of butcher stalls. It is hard to believe the poverty the radio commentators keep talking about. There seems to be plenty here to eat—except for guavas.

The fruit stands behind her now, Yolanda approaches a compound very like her family’s in the capital. A high concrete wall continues for about a quarter of a mile. A guard rises to his post beyond an iron grillwork gate. He seems—glimpsed through the flowering bars—a man locked in a strangely gorgeous prison. Beyond him up the shady driveway is a three-story country house, a wide verandah all the way around it. Parked at the door is a chocolate brown Mercedes. Perhaps the owners have come up to their country home to avoid the troubles in the capital. They are probably relatives. The dozen rich families have intermarried so many times that family trees are tangles of roots. In fact, her aunts have given her a list of names of uncles and aunts and cousins she might call on along her way. By each name is a capsule description of what Yolanda might remember of that relative: the one with the kidney bean swimming pool, the fat one, the one who was an ambassador. Before she even left the compound, Yolanda put the list away in the glove compartment. She is going to be just fine on her own.  
  
  A small village spreads out before her—ALTAMIRA, say the rippling letters on the corrugated tin roof of the first house. A little cluster of houses on either side of the road, Altamira is just the place to stretch her legs before what she has heard is a steep and slightly (her aunts warned “very”) dangerous descent to the coast. Yolanda pulls up at a cantina, its thatched roof held up by several posts, its floor poured cement, and in its very center, a lone picnic table over which a swarm of flies hover.  
  
  Tacked to one of the central posts is a yellowing poster for Palmolive soap. A creamy, blond woman luxuriates under a refreshing shower, her head thrown back in seeming ecstasy, her mouth opened in a wordless cry.  
  
  “¡Buenas!” Yolanda calls out.  
  
  An old woman emerges from a shack behind the cantina, buttoning up a torn housedress. She is followed closely by a little boy, who keeps ducking behind her whenever Yolanda smiles at him. Asking his name drives him further into the folds of the old woman’s skirt.  
  
  “You must excuse him, doña,” the woman apologizes. “He’s not used to being among people.” People with money who drive through Altamira to the beach resorts on the north coast, she means. “Your name,” the old woman repeats, as if Yolanda hasn’t asked him in Spanish. The little boy mumbles at the ground. “Speak up!” the old woman scolds, but her voice betrays pride when she speaks up for him. “This little know-nothing is Jose Duarte, Sanchez y Mella.”  
  
  Yolanda laughs. A lot of names for such a little boy—the surnames of the country’s three liberators!  
  
  “Can I serve the doña in any way?” the old woman asks.  
  
  “¡Un refresco! ¡Una Coca Cola!” By the pride in her voice, Yolanda understands the old woman wants to treat her to the best on her menu.  
  
  “I’ll tell you what I would like.” Yolanda gives the tree line beyond the old woman’s shack a glance. “Are there any guavas around?”  
  
  The old woman’s face scrunches up. “¡Guayabas!” she murmurs, and thinks to herself a second. “Why, they grow all around, doña. But I can’t say as I’ve seen any lately.”  
  
  “With your permission—” José Duarte has joined a group of little boys who have come out of nowhere and are milling around the car, boasting how many automobiles they have ridden in. At Yolanda’s mention of guavas, he springs forward, pointing across the road towards the summit of the western hills. “I know where there’s a whole grove of ripe ones.” Behind him, his little companions nod.  
  
  “Go on, then!” His grandmother stamps her foot as if she were scatting an animal. “Get the doña some.”  
  
  A few boys dash across the road and disappear up a steep path on the hillside, but before Jose can follow, Yolanda calls him back. She wants to go along too. The little boy looks towards his grandmother, unsure of what to think. The old woman shakes her head. The doña will get hot, her nice clothes will get all dirty. Jose will bring the doña as many guavas as she is wanting.  
  
  “But they taste so much better when you’ve picked them yourself.” Yolanda hears the edge in her voice. The old woman has turned into the long arm of her family.  
  
  The few boys who have stayed behind with José have again congregated around the car. Each one claims to be guarding it for the doña. It occurs to Yolanda that there is a way to make this a treat all the way around. “What do you say we take the car?” The little boys cheer.  
  
  Now that is not a bad idea, the old woman agrees. If the doña insists on going, she can take that dirt road up ahead and then cross over onto the road that is paved all the way to the coffee barns. The old woman points south in the direction of the big house. Many workers take that shortcut to work.  
  
  They pile into the car, half a dozen little boys in the back, and José as co-pilot in the passenger seat beside Yolanda. They turn onto a bumpy road off the highway, which grows bumpier and bumpier as it climbs up into wilder, more desolate country. Branches scrape the sides and pebbles pelt the underside of the car. Yolanda wants to turn back, but there is no room. Finally, with a great snapping of twigs and thrashing of branches across the windshield, as if the countryside is loath to release them, the car bursts forth onto smooth pavement and the light of day. On either side of the road are groves of guava trees. The boys who have gone ahead on foot are already pulling down branches and shaking loose a rain of guavas.  
  
  Yolanda eats several right on the spot, relishing the slightly bumpy feel of the skin in her hand, devouring the crunchy, sweet white meat. The boys watch her.  
  
  The group scatters to harvest the guavas. Yolanda and Jose, partners, wander far from the path that cuts through the grove. Soon they are bent almost double to avoid getting entangled in the thick canopy of branches overhead. Each addition to Yolanda’s beach basket causes a spill from the stash already piled high above the brim.  
  
  The way back seems much longer than the way there. Yolanda begins to worry that they are lost, and then, the way worry sprouts worry, it strikes her that they haven’t heard or seen the other boys in quite a while. The latticework of branches reveals glimmers of a fading sky. The image of the guard in his elaborate flowering prison flashes through her head. The rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: you will get lost, you will get kidnapped, you will get raped, you will get killed.  
  
  Just ahead, the thicket of guava branches clears, and there is the footpath, and beyond, the gratifying sight of the car still on the side of the road. It is a pleasure to stand upright again. Jose rests his burden on the ground and straightens his back to full measure. Yolanda looks up at the sky. The sun is low on the western horizon.  
  
  “The others must have gone to gather kindling,” Jose observes.  
  
  Yolanda glances at her watch—it is past six o’clock. At this rate, she will never make the north coast by nightfall. She hurries Jose back to the car, where they find a heap of guavas the other boys left behind on the shoulder of the road. Enough guavas to appease even the greediest Island santo for life!  
  
  They pack the trunk quickly, and climb in, but the car has not gone a foot before it lurches forward with a horrible hobble. Yolanda closes her eyes and lays her head down on the wheel, then glances over at Jose. His eyes are searching the inside of the car for a clue as to what could have happened. This child won’t know how to change a flat tire either.  
  
  Soon the sun will set and night will fall swiftly, no lingering dusk as in the States. She explains to Jose that they have a flat tire and must go back down the road to the big house. Whoever tends to the brown Mercedes will surely know how to change a tire.  
  
  “With your permission,” Jose offers. The doña can just wait in the car, and he will be back in no time with someone from the Miranda place.  
  
  Miranda, Miranda…. Yolanda leans over and gets her aunt’s list out of the glove compartment, and sure enough, there they are. Tía Marina y Tio Alejandro Miranda—Altos de Altamira. A note elaborates that Tio Alejandro was the one who used to own English saddle horses and taught you four girls to ride. “All right,” she says to the  
boy. “I’ll tell you what.” She points to her watch. “If you’re back by the time this hand is over here, I’ll give you”—she holds up one finger—“a dollar.” The boy’s mouth falls open. In no time, he has shot out of his side of the car and is headed at a run toward the Miranda place. Yolanda climbs out as well and walks down a pace, until the boy has disappeared in one of the turnings of the road.  
  
  From the footpath that cuts through the grove on the opposite side of the road, she hears the sound of branches being thrust aside, twigs snapping underfoot. Two men, one short and dark, and the other slender and light-skinned, emerge. They wear ragged work clothes stained with patches of sweat; their faces are drawn. Machetes hang from their belts.  
  
  The men’s faces snap awake at the sight of her. Then they look beyond her at the car. The darker man speaks first. “Yours?”  
  
  “Is there some problem?” he speaks up again. The taller one is looking her up and down with interest. They are now both in front of her on the road, blocking any escape. Both—she has sized them up as well—are strong and quite capable of catching her if she makes a run for it. Not that she can move, for her legs seem suddenly to have been hammered into the ground beneath her. She considers explaining that she is just out for a drive before dinner at the big house, so that these men will think someone knows where she is, someone will come looking for her if they try to carry her off. But her tongue feels as if it has been stuffed in her mouth like a rag to keep her quiet.  
  
  The two men exchange a look—it seems to Yolanda—of collusion.  
  
  Then the shorter, darker one speaks up again. “Senorita, are you all right?” He peers at her. He is a short man, no taller than Yolanda, but he gives the impression of being quite large, for he is broad and solid, like something not yet completely carved out of a piece of wood. His companion is slim and tall and of a rich honey-brown color that matches his honey-brown eyes. Anywhere else, Yolanda would find him extremely attractive, but here on a lonely road, with the sky growing darker by seconds, his good looks seem dangerous, a lure to catch her off her guard.

1mwiz1l,https://www.reddit.com/r/december2024babies/comments/1mwiz1l/small_babies_small_problems_but_im_already_losing/,Small babies - small problems but I’m already losing my mind,"Rant here. Yes, I have PPA, I know that and I am working as hard as I can. And I spend a fortune on therapy. Just doesn’t work for me. So, I decided to sort of give up and better spend money on something really nice for my baby and learn to work on myself with myself. 

Long story short I was always afraid of my baby getting sick. This is my worst nightmare. I was to this point where my hands are cracking and bleeding from small cracks because of excessive washing. So I decided to work on allowing my baby to get more “exposed” to the world to make myself realize is not that bad. Well, first human interaction he contacted Covid. Slap on my face. We don’t even know for sure from who he got the virus because still, no one had symptoms. I thought his first sickness will probably be some sort of a cold but no. Hospital, IV fluids because he refused eating for 2 days, tones of injections and broken veins. It was terrible. I was at the point when I got high blood pressure so I had to ask my husband stay with him in the hospital because I felt like I was going to do something bad to myself. Luckily I meet a very nice random person next day who decided to spend some time with me and teach me how to be positive just for a cup of coffee. So I am working on being positive now and literally reset my brain. Is hard as f. not gonna lie. I still have days when I feel like I am losing my mind. 
My baby has been diagnosed with some sort of benign external hydrocephalus which has to be monitored and for an over-thinker this is very hard job to stay sane 😅. I am also continuing to let my baby more exposed to the world however me and my husband are so traumatized after this experience. 

So I wrote this rant mostly to get it out of my chest and tell to mothers out there you are literally warriors! ",2,1755800637.0,december2024babies,2,1.0,False

For five years, Maris was nothing more than a stand-in Luna—a replacement for her twin sister who fled her mating ceremony. Alpha Ronan Duskbane claimed her only to salvage his pride, while her three brothers loved her only as a consolation prize.  
  
Then Lyanna returns. Beautiful, manipulative, and allegedly dying. And just like that, every scrap of love Maris thought she'd earned gets ripped away.  
  
Frame jobs. Murder attempts. Brutal punishments for crimes she never committed...  
  
But the real betrayal?  
  
Watching the four men who once cherished her stand by and let her die—all to keep their precious Lyanna happy.  
  
\*""The living can never compete with the dead.""\*  
  
So Maris makes a choice that destroys them all: she gives them exactly what they want. Her death.  
  
Buying a remote island, she thinks she's found peace. Until a mysterious Alpha washes ashore...  
  
Meanwhile, back home, four broken Alpha are learning the cruelest truth:  
  
\*""We killed Maris together. We're all murderers.\*  
Chapter 1  
  
  
Five years of mating, Ronan Duskbane had never officially claimed Maris Veylor as his Luna before the Moon Goddess.  
  
  
""Pack business keeps me swamped,"" he’d always say. ""I don’t have time for all that ceremonial crap. It’s not gonna change anything between us.""  
  
  
Maris had always believed him—until today.  
  
  
Ronan emerged from the Council chambers with her twin sister, who had vanished five years ago. They'd just completed their official mating ceremony.  
  
  
Lyanna Veylor threw herself into Ronan's arms, tears streaming down her face.  
  
  
""Ronan, I was wrong to run from our bonding ceremony all those years ago..."" Lyanna’s voice broke.  
  
  
""I know you’re only agreeing to make me your Luna now because the wolfsbane poisoning is killing me. But I still need to know—after all this time, have you truly forgotten me… and fallen for Maris?""  
  
  
Ronan went dead silent.  
  
  
Long enough for Maris to dig her nails so deep into her palms they drew blood.  
  
  
""No. Never.""  
  
  
Lyanna's face lit up with a smile. She shot up on her toes and kissed him. Ronan's hands hung in the air for a heartbeat before wrapping around her waist, pulling her closer.  
  
  
Standing across the street, Maris felt like her entire world had just been ripped apart.  
  
  
If he never got over Lyanna, then what the hell was she?  
  
  
""BEEP—""  
  
  
Honking cars snapped her out of her spiral. Three black cars rolled up, and the Veylor brothers climbed out in black suits.  
  
  
""All done with the ceremony? We booked a place to celebrate,""she elder brother Cassian said.  
  
  
Maris started shaking.  
  
  
These were the same brothers who'd made her breakfast this morning...  
  
  
""Cassian! Dorian! Theron!"" Lyanna threw herself at them, sobbing. ""I thought you guys would never forgive me...""  
  
  
The three brothers shared a look. Finally, Theron messed up her hair. ""Come on, Ly. We’ve had your back since we were pups.”  
  
  
Lyanna laughed through her tears, linking arms with all three like old times.  
  
  
The four of them piled into the cars, all smiles and family reunion vibes.  
  
  
Not one of them even noticed Maris.  
  
  
Long after the convoy disappeared, Maris stumbled against a tree. The rough bark tore into her arm, but it was nothing compared to the agony ripping through her chest.  
  
  
Lyanna had always been everyone's precious little princess.  
  
  
They were twins, but their three brothers only ever gave a damn about Lyanna.  
  
  
Maris lay burning with fever while they were off enjoying the theme park with Lyanna.  
  
  
On her birthday, she'd sit alone until midnight while they threw parties for Lyanna.  
  
  
She'd been crazy about Ronan for ten years, only to watch him choose Lyanna as his mate.  
  
  
She once thought the Moon Goddess had destined her to live without love.  
  
  
Until that mating ceremony five years ago—  
  
  
Lyanna had bolted, running off with some rogue asshole.  
  
  
Both packs were completely humiliated. Her three brothers swore on the spot: ""From now on, Maris is our only sister!""  
  
  
That night, Ronan stumbled into her room, drunk off his ass.  
  
  
He slammed her against the wall, fingers rough on her face. ""You and her... fuck, you share the same face.""  
  
  
Then he shoved the ring meant for Lyanna onto her finger.  
  
  
""She bailed on me. So...you'll be my Luna instead, right?""  
  
  
She should've said no. But she'd wanted him for so long.  
  
  
These past five years, Ronan had spoiled her rotten—made her the most envied she-wolf.  
  
  
He'd drop serious cash at auctions for jewelry she barely glanced at. He'd rent out entire rooftop restaurants, lighting up the skyline with fireworks just for her. Every time she had nightmares, he'd ditch pack meetings to hold her and whisper sweet words until she fell asleep.  
  
  
Her brothers had changed too.  
  
  
Cassian picked her up from work every single day. Dorian remembered she was allergic to shellfish, checking every ingredient. Theron would pull all-nighters helping with her design projects, grinning as he said, ""Our little Maris comes first.""  
  
  
She actually thought they loved her.  
  
  
Until today. Lyanna came back.  
  
  
And everyone's love just... vanished. Like it was never real.  
  
  
Maris watched those taillights fade and started laughing.  
  
  
Quiet at first, then louder, laughing until she was doubled over sobbing. People stared, but nobody knew why this gorgeous woman was having a complete breakdown on the sidewalk.  
  
  
She'd been nothing but a thief.  
  
  
Stealing love that belonged to Lyanna. Now the real deal was back. Time for the stand-in to get lost.  
  
  
""You all only want her anyway..."" Her voice cracked, chest so tight she could barely breathe. ""Then I don't want any of you either!""  
  
  
She flagged down a cab. ""International Private Island Sales. Downtown.""  
  
  
Thirty minutes later, she walked into the sleek office building.  
  
  
""I want to buy a private island.""  
  
  
The receptionist's jaw dropped. She quickly called over some manager guy.  
  
  
""Luna, this particular island is... intense. Yeah, it's gorgeous, but there's zero cell service. No boats, no supply runs except every three months.""  
  
  
He leaned forward. """"Once you choose the island, you choose to disappear from the world. You sure about this?""  
  
  
""Yeah, I am sure.""  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
  
The manager saw her red-rimmed eyes and didn't dare ask any more questions.  
  
  
He quickly shuffled the paperwork together. ""We'll rush the process. You'll hear from us soon about departure times.""  
  
  
Maris signed everything without hesitation and paid with her black card.  
  
  
By the time she got home, it was pitch black outside.  
  
  
Maris pushed open the front door to warm light spilling from the living room, illuminating the perfect little family scene on the couch.  
  
  
Ronan was peeling an apple for Lyanna, his long fingers working the knife like he was carving art. Her three brothers clustered around the sofa—Dorian holding a medicine bowl, coaxing gently: ""Lyanna, time for your meds.""  
  
  
""It's so bitter..."" Lyanna wrinkled her nose, pouting. ""I want candy.""  
  
  
Theron immediately dug a caramel out of his pocket. ""Your favorite since we were pups—been saving it for you.""  
  
  
Maris stood frozen in the entryway, nails digging crescents into her palms.  
  
  
""Maris?"" Ronan spotted her first, setting down the knife. ""Where've you been all day?""  
  
  
His voice was still gentle, like he hadn't been tongue-deep with Lyanna outside the Council chambers this afternoon.  
  
  
Maris didn't answer, just stared past him at Lyanna.  
  
  
Ronan followed her gaze and explained casually, ""Lyanna’s running out of time. All she wants is for us to be there when it ends.""  
  
  
He paused. ""Look, running from our mating ceremony was shitty, but she's still your sister. For your sake...""  
  
  
""For my sake?"" Maris laughed harshly. ""Or because you never got over her?""  
  
  
Ronan's jaw tightened. ""Maris...""  
  
  
""Maris!"" Cassian walked over, reaching to ruffle her hair out of habit before stopping mid-air and awkwardly patting her shoulder instead. ""Lyanna doesn't have long left. It's no big deal having her here.""  
  
  
""Exactly,"" Dorian chimed in. ""She was immature when we were pups, but she's learned her lesson out there. We're still family.""  
  
  
Theron joined. ""Come on, Maris. You've always been the understanding one, right?""  
  
  
Maris listened to them tag-team her, her heart going numb from the pain.  
  
  
Finally, she nodded quietly. ""Fine.""  
  
  
All four men visibly relaxed, relief flooding their faces.  
  
  
""You stay with Lyanna,"" Ronan said softly. ""We'll go set up her room.""  
  
  
Once their footsteps faded upstairs, Lyanna slowly approached.  
  
  
She was pale, but her eyes sparkled with triumph. ""Maris, it's been five years. I brought you a present.""  
  
  
Maris instinctively stepped back.  
  
  
Lyanna's ""presents"" were always stuffed animals with needles inside or cakes laced with laxatives.  
  
  
""Relax,"" Lyanna smiled sweetly. ""I won't hurt you.""  
  
  
She shoved the gift box into Maris's arms and helpfully lifted the lid.  
  
  
""Ah!""  
  
  
A pitch-black viper shot out, sinking its fangs deep into Maris's wrist!  
  
  
Searing pain exploded up her arm. Maris reflexively hurled the box away—it smacked right into Lyanna's shoulder.  
  
  
Lyanna collapsed to the floor with a scream. ""Ahh!""  
  
  
""What the hell happened?!""  
  
  
The four men came thundering downstairs to see Lyanna collapsed on the floor in tears while Maris clutched her bleeding wrist.  
  
  
Ronan rushed over first, shoving Maris aside. ""What did you do?!""  
  
  
Maris staggered backward, slamming into the coffee table. Sharp pain shot through her.  
  
  
""Lyanna was being nice, bringing you a gift,"" Cassian said coldly, helping Lyanna to her feet. ""And this is how you treat her?""  
  
  
""There was a snake..."" Maris broke out in cold sweats from the pain. ""She put a viper in the box... it bit me...""  
  
  
""Bullshit!"" Theron snapped. ""Lyanna can barely walk right now. Where would she get a damn snake?""  
  
  
Lyanna sobbed pitifully. ""Ronan, Cassian, Dorian, Theron... I just wanted to give her a gift so we could make up. I never thought she'd hate me this much. Why is she saying such horrible things about me?""  
  
  
Maris couldn't believe Lyanna was still this good at playing victim after five years. Fighting through the agony, she tried to grab the gift box. ""I'm not lying! Look, you can see—""  
  
  
""Enough!"" Ronan grabbed her wrist right over the bite marks. Fresh blood gushed out. ""She's your sister, and she's dying! How can you be this fucking cruel?""  
  
  
Dorian was already scooping Lyanna up. ""We need to get to the hospital. She can't handle this stress.""  
  
  
All four of them rushed out without a backward glance at Maris.  
  
  
""It really was... a snake...""  
  
  
Maris collapsed to her knees as the venom spread through her system. Her vision started blurring.  
  
  
She saw the housekeeper rushing over in a panic, heard her terrified screams, but her consciousness was already fading.  
  
  
""Luna Maris! Luna!"" Martha knelt beside her, frantically patting her face. ""Stay awake!""  
  
  
The ambulance sirens wailed as they rushed her to the hospital, but the moment they wheeled her into the ER, all the doctors were pulled away.  
  
  
""I'm sorry, all our doctors have been reassigned to the VIP ward,"" the nurse said helplessly. ""Alpha Cassian Veylor's sister Lyanna's condition suddenly got worse. Orders from the top—every doctor has to focus on her today. You'll have to try another hospital.""  
  
  
Martha's voice cracked with desperation. ""No, please! If we move her now, she won’t make it!""  
  
  
Maris lay on the gurney, consciousness flickering in and out. The pain was excruciating, but her heart hurt even worse.  
  
  
She fumbled for her phone and used her last bit of strength to call Ronan.  
  
  
It rang forever before he picked up.  
  
  
""Ronan..."" Her voice was barely a whisper. ""I got bit by a snake... can you send... just one doctor...""  
  
  
""Maris!"" Ronan's voice was ice cold. ""Lyanna's condition crashed because you SHOVED her! The wolfsbane poisoning is killing her wolf, and you're still playing victim? Just CUT the DRAMA!""  
  
  
""No... I'm really...""  
  
  
He hung up on her.  
  
  
Maris stared at the phone as silent tears rolled down her cheeks. She curled up in a ball, consciousness slipping away.  
  
  
""Luna! Luna!"" Martha sobbed, shaking her. ""Don't close your eyes! Stay with me!""  
  
  
But she couldn't hold on anymore. Everything hurt so much, and she was so tired...  
  
  
Her eyes slowly fluttered shut.  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
  
She woke up again the next day.  
  
  
Maris slowly opened her eyes to the sharp smell of disinfectant.  
  
  
""Luna! You're finally awake!"" Martha rushed to her bedside with swollen eyes, gripping her cold fingers with rough, warm hands. ""You scared me!""  
  
  
""How..."" Maris's voice came out as a rasp. ""How am I... still alive?""  
  
  
Fresh tears streamed down Martha's face. ""Some doctor couldn't bear to watch you die. He snuck you the antivenom. Said if we'd been ten minutes later, you would've been gone.""  
  
  
Her voice broke completely. ""Luna, I begged Alpha Cassian, told him you really got bit by a snake. He said you were faking it. Beta Dorian wouldn't even see me. And Gamma Theron... he said you deserved it...""  
  
  
Martha wiped her tears, shaking harder. ""Alpha Ronan was the worst! I got on my knees begging him to come see you. He... he said you were making everything up and that I was helping you lie to him!""  
  
  
""Luna..."" Martha suddenly grabbed her hand, warmth flowing between their palms. ""You've been so good to them! Last winter when Alpha Cassian had pack meetings until 3 AM, you'd be in that freezing kitchen making soup in just your nightgown. You got sick yourself.""  
  
  
""When Beta Dorian's pack investments went south, you secretly sold your grandmother's bracelet.""  
  
  
""When Gamma Theron had that fever, you stayed up three days straight taking care of him until you collapsed.""  
  
  
Martha's voice rose with emotion. ""And Alpha Ronan! His favorite tie brands, the coffee he likes—even his own mother doesn't remember, but you know it all by heart.""  
  
  
""But now they're all circling around Lyanna. But she abandoned Alpha Ronan at their mating ceremony!  
  
  
Your sister had bullied you since you were pups. Now she gets everyone's love while you... how is this world so unfair...""  
  
  
Maris listened quietly, her heart feeling like it was being crushed by an invisible fist.  
  
  
Tears slid silently down her cheeks, soaking the pillow.  
  
  
That pain cut a thousand times deeper than any snakebite.  
  
  
But it didn't matter. Soon, all of this would be over.  
  
  
She'd be on that island soon.  
  
  
No fake love there. No substitute games. And no... them.  
  
  
Maris came home from the hospital two days later.  
  
  
Happy birthday songs and laughter hit her in the face the moment she opened the door.  
  
  
Pack members and allied alphas filled the living room, clinking glasses under crystal chandeliers. Ronan and her three brothers surrounded Lyanna, celebrating her birthday.  
  
  
Lyanna wore an elegant dress, smiling sweetly—looking nothing like a dying wolf.  
  
  
All four men's smiles froze when they saw Maris.  
  
  
""Thought you were dying?"" Cassian looked her up and down coldly, his eyes sharp as blades behind gold-rimmed glasses. ""Seems pretty alive to me.""  
  
  
Dorian frowned, his wine glass catching the cold light. ""Lyanna doesn't have much time left. Can't you just be reasonable for once?""  
  
  
Theron played with his watch, sounding annoyed. ""Could you stop lying all the damn time?""  
  
  
Ronan walked over, his tone gentle but final. ""Lyanna's time is running out. Stop picking fights with her.""  
  
  
He paused. ""I know you're bothered by my past with Lyanna, but you're my Luna now.""  
  
  
Maris's heart clenched violently.  
  
  
Luna?  
  
  
She was the one who'd stood by his side all these years. She was the one who helped him through his lowest point.  
  
  
She was the one who spread her legs for him whenever he wanted—in his office, at pack events...  
  
  
But the second Lyanna came back, she became the one completing that official mating ceremony with him!  
  
  
And he had the balls to lie to her face, saying she was his Luna now!  
  
  
Her eyes gradually turned red, but her lips curved into a smile. Ronan had never seen her like this before. Something twisted in his chest, and he was about to speak—  
  
  
But Lyanna's sweet voice suddenly rang out behind him. ""Ronan, Cassian, Dorian, Theron, come help me cut the cake.""  
  
  
The big screen in the living room lit up, starting to play birthday video messages.  
  
  
The first half showed guests giving warm, touching wishes.  
  
  
But halfway through, the screen suddenly switched to explicit photos of Lyanna with some low-life rogue!  
  
  
It ended on a line of blood-red text:  
  
  
【My special birthday gift for you. Hope you love it, dear sister.】  
  
  
The entire house exploded into chaos.  
  
  
""Turn it off! Turn it off right fucking now!"" Cassian's furious roar made the crystal chandelier shake.  
  
  
Dorian yanked the power cord while Theron rushed to the guests, warning each one: ""Everyone hands over your phones. Anyone leaks this shit, you're dead.""  
  
  
Lyanna was shaking all over, her carefully styled hair falling apart.  
  
  
Her face went ghost white, fat tears streaming down. ""Maris, you already stole Ronan from me, stole my brothers' love... I'm dying, and you still want to destroy me?""  
  
  
She stumbled backward, then collapsed—  
  
  
""Lyanna!"" Ronan lunged forward, catching her in his arms.  
  
  
Panic flashed across his usually cold, composed face for the first time. ""Get a doctor! Now! Right fucking now!""  
  
  
Before rushing out, he shot Maris one last look—ice cold, cutting right through her.  
  
  
Her three brothers instantly surrounded her.  
  
  
""Maris!"" Cassian grabbed her wrist, nearly crushing bone. ""Look what you've done! We told you she's DYING, and you still pull this shit?""  
  
  
""It wasn't me!"" Maris shook her head frantically, voice trembling. ""I didn't put those photos up there!""  
  
  
""The evidence is right fucking there and you're still lying?"" Dorian laughed coldly. ""You need pay for your mistakes.""  
  
  
Pay for her mistakes?!  
  
  
Those words hit her hard.  
  
  
She remembered Lyanna pushed her down the stairs when they're twelve. But her brothers said ""Lyanna didn't mean it.""  
  
  
At her eighteenth birthday, Lyanna threw her cake in the trash, and her brothers said ""she was just playing around.""  
  
  
She remembered that cold winter night, Lyanna locked her on the balcony. And they said ""Lyanna's been going through a rough patch.""  
  
  
Lyanna had screwed up countless times and always got forgiven.  
  
  
Now they wanted to punish her?

  “Never thought we’d ever see this place again.” Sophie Newman grinned and looked at her brother.  
  
  “Never thought I’d be so happy to see it,” Josh said. “It looks … I don’t know. Different.”  
  
  “It looks the same,” his twin answered. “We’re the ones who’ve changed.”  
  
  Sophie and Josh were walking down Scott Street in Pacific Heights, heading for their aunt Agnes’s house on the corner of Sacramento Street. They had last seen the house six days earlier—Thursday, May 31—when they had left for work, Sophie at the coffee shop, Josh in the bookstore. It had started as just another ordinary day, but it had turned out to be the last ordinary day they would ever experience.  
  
  That day their world had changed forever; they too had changed, both physically and mentally.  
  
  “What do we tell her?” Josh asked nervously. Aunt Agnes was eighty-four, and although they called her aunt, she was not actually related to them by blood. Sophie thought she might have been their grandmother’s sister … or cousin, or maybe just a friend, but she had never been quite sure. Aunt Agnes was a sweet but grumpy old lady who fussed and worried if they were even five minutes late. She drove both Sophie and Josh crazy and reported back to their parents about every single thing they did.  
  
  “We keep it simple,” Sophie said. “We stick to the story we told Mom and Dad—first the bookshop closed because Perenelle wasn’t feeling well, and then the Flamels …”  
  
  “The Flemings,” Josh corrected her.  
  
  “The Flemings invited us to stay with them in their house in the desert.”  
  
  “And why did the bookshop close?”  
  
  “Gas leak.”  
  
  Josh nodded. “Gas leak. And where’s the house in the desert?”  
\>  
  “Joshua Tree.”  
  
  “OK, I got it.”  
  
  “Are you sure? You’re a terrible liar.”  
  
  Josh shrugged. “I’ll try. You know we’re going to get grilled.”  
  
  “I know. And that’s even before we have to talk to Mom and Dad.”  
  
  Josh nodded. He glanced over at Sophie. He’d been mulling something over for the past few days, and figured this would be the perfect time to bring it up. “I’ve been thinking,” he said slowly. “Maybe we should just tell them the truth.”  
  
  “The truth?” Sophie’s expression remained unchanged and the twins continued walking, crossing Jackson Street. They could see their aunt’s white wooden Victorian house three blocks away.  
  
  “What do you think?” Josh asked, when his sister said nothing more.  
  
  Finally Sophie nodded. “Sure, we could.” She brushed a few strands of blond hair out of her eyes and looked at her brother. “But just let me get this straight first. We’re going to tell Mom and Dad that their entire life’s work has been for nothing. That everything they have ever studied—history, archaeology and paleontology—is wrong.” Her eyes sparkled. “I think it’s a great idea. But I’ll let you go ahead and do it, and I’ll watch.”  
  
  Josh shrugged uncomfortably. “OK, OK, so we don’t tell them.”  
  
  “Not yet, in any case.”  
  
  “Agreed, but it’ll come out sooner or later. You know how impossible it is to keep secrets from them. They always know everything.”  
  
  “That’s because Aunt Agnes tells them,” Sophie muttered.  
  
  A sleek black stretch limousine with tinted windows drove slowly past them, the driver leaning forward, checking addresses on the tree-lined street. The car signaled and pulled in farther down the block.  
  
  Josh indicated the limo with a jerk of his chin. “That’s weird. It looks like it’s stopping outside Aunt Agnes’s.”  
  
  Sophie looked up disinterestedly. “I just wish there was someone we could talk to,” she murmured. “Someone like Gilgamesh.” Her blue eyes magnified with sudden tears. “I hope he’s OK.” The last time she had seen the immortal, he’d just been wounded by an arrow fired by the Horned God. She looked at her brother, irritated. “You’re not even listening to me.”  
  
  “That car is stopping outside Agnes’s house,” Josh said slowly. A vague warning tingled at the back of his skull. “Soph?”  
  
  “What is it?”  
  
  “When was the last time Aunt Agnes had a visitor?”  
  
  “She never has visitors.”  
  
  The twins watched a slender black-suited driver get out of the car and climb the steps, his black-gloved hand trailing lightly on the metal rail. Their Awakened hearing clearly heard the knock on the door, and unconsciously they increased their pace. They saw their aunt Agnes open the door. She was a slight, bony woman, all angles and planes, with knobby knees and swollen arthritic fingers. Josh knew that in her youth she had been considered a great beauty—but her youth had been a long time ago. She had never married, and there was a family story that the love of her life had been killed in the war. Josh wasn’t sure which one.  
  
  “Josh?” Sophie asked.  
  
  “Something’s not right,” Josh muttered. He broke into a jog; Sophie fell into step beside him, easily keeping up.  
  
  The twins saw the driver’s hand move and Aunt Agnes take something from him. She leaned forward, squinting at what looked like a photograph. But when she bent closer to get a better look, the driver immediately slipped around behind her and darted into the house.  
  
  Josh took off at a sprint. “Don’t let the car leave!” he shouted at Sophie. He raced across the street and up the steps into the house. “Hi, Aunt Agnes, we’re home,” he called as he ran past her.  
  
  The old woman turned in a complete circle, the photograph fluttering from her fingertips.  
  
  Sophie followed her brother across the street but stopped behind the car. She stooped and pressed her fingertips against the rear passenger tire. Her thumb brushed the circle on the back of her wrist and her fingers glowed white-hot. She pushed; there was the stink of burning rubber, and then, with five distinct popping sounds, the rubber tire was punctured. Air hissed out and the tire quickly settled onto its metal rim.  
  
  “Sophie!” the old woman shrieked as the girl ran up the steps and grabbed her confused aunt. “What’s going on? Where have you been? Who was that nice young man? Was that Josh I just saw?”  
  
  “Aunt Agnes, come with me.” Sophie drew her aunt away from the door, just in case Josh or the driver came rushing out and the old woman was accidentally knocked down. She knelt and picked up the picture her aunt had dropped, then helped the older woman a safe distance away from the house. Sophie looked at the photograph: it was a sepia image of a young woman dressed in what looked like a nurse’s uniform. The word Ypres and the date 1914 had been written in white ink in the bottom right-hand corner. Sophie caught her breath—there was no doubt who the person was. The woman in the photograph was Scathach.  
  
  Josh stepped into the darkened hallway and pressed flat against the wall, waiting until his eyes had adjusted to the gloom. Last week he wouldn’t have known to do that, but then, last week he wouldn’t have run into a house after an intruder. He would have done the sensible thing and dialed 911. He reached into the umbrella stand behind the door and lifted out one of his aunt’s thick walking sticks. It wasn’t Clarent, but it would have to do.  
  
  Josh remained still, head tilted to one side, listening. Where was the stranger?  
  
  There was a creak on the landing and a young-looking man in a simple black suit, white shirt and narrow black tie came hurrying down the stairs. He slowed when he spotted Josh, but didn’t stop. He smiled, yet it seemed more of a reflex than a voluntary gesture—it didn’t move past his lips. Now that the man was closer, Josh saw that he was Asian; Japanese, maybe?  
  
  Josh stepped forward, the walking stick stretched out in front of him like a sword. “Where do you think you’re going?”  
  
  “Past you or through you, makes no difference to me,” the man said in English tinged with a strong Japanese accent.  
  
  “What are you doing here?” Josh demanded.  
  
  “Looking for someone,” the man answered simply.  
  
  The intruder came off the bottom step into the hall and moved to walk out the front door, but Josh barred his route with the stick. “Not so fast. You owe me an answer.”  
  
  The black-suited man grabbed the stick, yanked it from Josh’s grip and snapped it across his knee. Josh grimaced; that had to hurt. The man tossed the two pieces on the floor. “I owe you nothing, but you should be thankful that I am in a good mood today.”  
  
  There was something in the man’s voice that made Josh step back. Something cold and calculating that made him suddenly wonder if the man was entirely human. Josh stood in the doorway and watched the man move lightly down the steps. He was reaching for the car door when he spotted the back tire.  
  
  Sophie smiled and waggled her fingers at him. “Looks like you have a puncture.”  
  
  Josh hurried down the steps and joined his sister and their aunt. “Josh,” Agnes said querulously, “what is going on?” Her gray eyes were huge behind thick glasses.  
  
  The rear passenger window eased down a fraction and the Japanese man spoke urgently into it, gesturing toward the tire.  
  
  Abruptly the door opened and a young woman climbed out. She was dressed in a beautifully tailored black suit over a white silk shirt. There were black leather gloves on her hands and a pair of tiny round black sunglasses perched on her nose. But it was her spiky red hair and pale freckled skin that gave her away.  
  
  “Scathach!” both Sophie and Josh cried in delight.  
  
  The woman smiled, revealing a mouthful of vampire teeth. She pushed down the glasses to reveal brilliant green eyes. “Hardly,” she snapped. “I am Aoife of the Shadows. And I want to know what has happened to my twin sister.”  
  
  CHAPTER TWO  
  
  “Never thought I’d see this place again,” Nicholas Flamel said, pushing open the rear door t  
o the Small Bookshop.  
  
  “Nor I,” Perenelle agreed.  
  
  The bottom of the door stuck and Nicholas pressed his shoulder against it and shoved hard. The door scraped on the stone floor and the stench hit them immediately: the slightly sweet stink of rotten wood and moldering paper mixed with the cloying rancid odor of decay. Perenelle coughed and pressed her hand to her mouth, blinking sudden tears from her eyes. “That’s foul!”  
  
  Nicholas inhaled cautiously. He could still smell traces of Dee’s brimstone odor on the dry air, the rotten-egg smell of sulfur. The couple moved down a dark corridor piled high on both sides with boxes of secondhand books. The cardboard boxes were streaked with black rot and the tops had started to curl. Some had burst apart, spilling their contents onto the floor.  
  
  Perenelle brushed a fingertip against one and it came away black with mold. She held it up for her husband to see and said, “Tell me?”  
  
  “The doctor and I fought,” he said softly.  
  
  “I can see that,” Perenelle said with a smile. “And you won.”  
  
  “Well, winning is a relative term.…” Nicholas opened the door at the end of the corridor and stepped into the bookshop. “I’m afraid the shop did not fare too well.” Reaching back, he took his wife’s hand and led her into the large book-filled room.  
  
  “Oh, Nicholas …,” Perenelle breathed.  
  
  The bookshop was ruined.  
  
  A thick layer of furry green-black mold covered everything, and the smell of sulfur was overwhelming. Books lay everywhere—pages torn, covers shredded, spines broken—among the crushed and splintered tables and shelves that had held them. A huge swath of the ceiling was missing, the plaster hanging like tattered cloth, revealing wooden joists and trailing wires, and where the entrance to the cellar had been was now a gaping hole, the wood around it rotted to a foul black mess speckled with mushrooms. Tiny wriggling white maggots crawled through the muck. The brightly colored rug that had once covered the center of the floor had shriveled to an ugly gray threadbare cloth.  
  
  “Destruction and decay,” Perenelle murmured, “Dee’s calling card.” The tall elegant woman picked her way carefully into the room. Everything she touched either crumbled to dust or dissolved into a powder that gave off spores. The floorboards were spongy and sticky and creaked ominously with each step, threatening to send her into the basement below. Standing in the middle of the room, she put her hands on her hips and turned slowly. Her huge green eyes filled with tears. She had loved this bookshop; it had been their home and their life for a decade. They had worked at many careers through the centuries, but this bookshop more than any other reminded her of her early life with Nicholas, when he had been a scrivener and bookseller in Paris in the fourteenth century. Then, they had been simple, ordinary people, living unremarkable lives, until that fateful day when Nicholas had bought the Codex, the Book of Abraham the Mage, from the hooded man with astonishingly blue eyes. That was the day their mundane lives ended and they entered the world of the extraordinary, where nothing was as it seemed and no one could be trusted.

 She turned to look at her husband. He hadn’t moved from the door and was staring around the shop with a stricken expression on his face. “Nicholas,” she said softly, and when he looked up, she realized just how much the last week had aged him. For centuries, his appearance had changed very little. With his close-cropped hair, unlined face and pale eyes, he’d always looked around fifty years old, which was the age he’d been when they started to make the immortality potion. Today, he looked at least seventy. Much of his hair was gone, and there were deep wrinkles on his forehead; more lines were etched into the corners of his sunken eyes, and there were dark spots on the back of his hands.  
  
  The Alchemyst caught her looking at him and smiled ruefully. “I know. I look old—but still, not too bad for someone who’s lived for six hundred and seventy-seven years.”  
  
  “Seventy-six,” Perenelle corrected him gently. “You’re not seventy-seven for another three months.”  
  
  Nicholas stepped forward and gathered Perenelle into his arms, hugging her close. “I don’t think that’s a birthday I’ll be celebrating,” he said very softly, his mouth close to her ear. “I’ve used more of my aura in the past week than I’ve done in the last two decades. And without the Codex …” His voice trailed away. He didn’t need to finish the sentence. Without the immortality spell that appeared once a month on page seven in the Codex, he and Perenelle would both begin to age, and death would follow quickly afterward as their accumulated years caught up with them.  
  
  Perenelle suddenly pushed her husband away from her. “We’re not dead yet!” she snapped, anger making her revert to the provincial French of her youth. “We’ve been in bad situations before—we survived.” The merest suggestion of her aura crackled around her, icy tendrils smoking off her flesh.  
  
  Nicholas stepped back and folded his arms across his narrow chest. “We’ve always had the Codex,” he reminded her in the same language.  
  
  “I am not talking about immortality now,” Perenelle said, her Breton accent thickening. “We have lived centuries, Nicholas, centuries. I am not afraid to die because I know that when we go, we will go together. It is living without you that would be unbearable.”  
  
  The Alchemyst nodded, not trusting himself to speak. He could not imagine a life without Perenelle.  
  
  “We need to do what we have always done,” she insisted, “fight for the survival of the human race.” Perenelle reached out and caught her husband’s arms, her fingers biting painfully into his flesh. “For six hundred years we have protected the Codex and kept the Dark Elders off the earth. We will not stop.” Her face turned hard. “But now, Nicholas, we have nothing to lose. Instead of running and hiding to protect the book, we should attack,” she said fiercely. “We should take the fight to the Dark Elders.”  
  
  The Alchemyst nodded uncomfortably. It was at times like these that Perenelle frightened him. Although they had been married for centuries, there was still so much he didn’t know about his wife and the extraordinary gift that allowed her to see the shades of the dead. “You’re right, we have nothing to lose,” Nicholas said softly. “We have lost so much already.”  
  
  “This time we have the advantage of the twins,” Perenelle reminded him.  
  
  “I am not sure they will entirely trust us,” the Alchemyst said. He took a deep breath. “In London, they learned about the existence of the previous twins.”  
  
  “Ah,” Perenelle said. “From Gilgamesh?”  
  
  The Alchemyst nodded. “From the King. Now I’m not sure they will believe anything we tell them.”  
  
  “Well then,” Perenelle said with a grim smile. “We tell them the truth. The whole truth,” she added, looking hard at her husband.  
  
  Nicholas Flamel held her eyes for a moment and then nodded and looked away. “And nothing but the truth.” He sighed. He waited until she had left the room and then added softly, “But the truth is a double-edged sword; it is a dangerous thing.”  
  
  “I heard that,” she called.  
  
  CHAPTER THREE  
  
  “You phone your parents right now.” Aunt Agnes glared nearsightedly at Sophie and then turned to Josh, who was closer. “They’ve been worried sick about you. Phoning me every day, twice, three times a day. Only this morning they said if you weren’t home today they were going to contact the police and report you as missing.” She paused and then added dramatically, “They were going to say you’d been kidnapped.”  
  
  “We weren’t kidnapped. We talked to Mom and Dad a couple of days ago,” Josh muttered. He was desperately trying to remember just when he’d talked to his parents. Was it Friday … or was it Saturday? He glanced sideways at his sister, looking for help, but she was still staring at the woman in black who looked so astonishingly like Scathach. He turned back to face his aunt. He knew he’d gotten an e-mail from their parents on … was it Saturday when they were all in Paris? Now that he was back in San Francisco, the last few days were beginning to blur together. “We just got back,” he said finally, settling on the truth. He kissed his aunt quickly on both cheeks. “How have you been? We missed you.”  
  
  “You could have called,” the tiny woman snapped. “You should have called.” Flint-gray eyes magnified behind enormous spectacles glared up at the twins. “Worried sick, I’ve been. I phoned the bookshop a dozen times looking for you, and you never answered your cell. Not much point in having a cell if you don’t answer it.”  
  
  “We had no reception most of the time,” Josh said, sticking to the truth, “and then I lost my phone,” he added, which was also the truth. His phone and most of his belongings had disappeared when Dee had destroyed the Yggdrasill.  
  
  “You lost your good phone?” The old woman shook her head in disgust. “That’s the third phone this year.”  
  
  “Second,” he muttered.  
  
  Aunt Agnes turned and climbed slowly up the steps. She waved away Josh’s offer of help. “Just leave me be; I’m not helpless,” she said, and then reached out to grip his arm. “You could help me, young man.” When they reached the door, she turned and looked down to where Sophie was still standing in front of the red-haired woman. “Sophie, are you coming?”  
  
  “In a minute, Aunty.” Sophie looked at her brother, then her eyes drifted toward the open door. “I’ll be there in a minute, Josh. Why don’t you take Aunt Agnes inside and make her a cup of tea?”  
  
  Josh started to shake his head, but the old woman’s fingers bit into his arm with surprising strength. “And while the kettle is boiling, you can phone your parents.” She squinted at Sophie again. “Don’t be long.”  
  
  Sophie Newman shook her head. “I won’t be.”  
  
  As soon as Josh and Aunt Agnes had disappeared inside the house, Sophie turned to the stranger. “Who are you?” she demanded.  
  
  “Aoife,” the woman said, pronouncing the name “E-fa.” She bent and ran black-gloved hands over the limo’s punctured tire, then spoke in a language Sophie recognized as Japanese. The young-looking man Josh had encountered in the house took off his jacket, flung it onto the front seat and then popped the trunk and pulled out a brace and jack. Fitting the jack under the heavy car, he levered it up with ease and started to change the tire.  
  
  Aoife brushed her gloved hands together, then folded her arms across her chest and tilted her head to look at Sophie. “There was no need to do that.” There was a hint of a lilting foreign accent in her voice.  
  
  “We thought you were kidnapping our aunt,” Sophie said quietly. The name Aoife had sent a dozen strange thoughts and images whirling through her brain, but Sophie was finding it hard to distinguish between memories of Scathach and those of Aoife. “We wanted to stop you.”  
  
  Aoife smiled without showing her teeth. “If I had wanted to kidnap your aunt, would I have turned up here in the middle of the day?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” Sophie said, “would you?”  
  
  Aoife pushed her small dark glasses up her nose, covering her green eyes, and considered for a moment. “Perhaps. Perhaps not. But,” she added with a smile that exposed her vampire teeth, “if I h  
ad wanted your aunt, I would have taken her.”  
  
  “You are Aoife of the Shadows,” Sophie said.  
  
  “I am Scathach’s sister. We are twins. I am the elder.”  
  
  Sophie took a step back, the Witch’s memories of Aoife finally falling into place. “Scathach told me about her family, but she didn’t say anything about a sister,” she said, unwilling to reveal to the woman that she knew about her.  
  
  “No, she wouldn’t. We had a falling-out,” Aoife muttered.  
  
  “A falling-out?” Sophie asked although she already knew they had fought over a boy, and even knew his name.  
  
  “Over a boy,” Aoife said, with just a hint of sadness in her voice. She looked up and down the street before turning back to Sophie. “We’ve not spoken in a very long time.” She shrugged, a quick roll of her shoulders. “She disowned me. And I her. But I’ve always kept an eye out for her.” She smiled again. “I’m sure you know what it is like to look out for your sibling.”  
  
  Sophie nodded. She knew exactly what Aoife was talking about. Even though Josh was bigger and stronger than she was, she still thought of him as her baby brother.  
  
  “He’s my twin.”  
  
  “I did not know that,” Aoife said slowly. Dipping her head slightly, she looked at Sophie over the top of her dark glasses. “And you are both Awakened, too,” she added.  
  
  “What brought you here?” Sophie asked.  
  
  “I felt Scathach … go.”  
  
  “Go?” Sophie didn’t understand.  
  
  “Vanish. Leave this particular Shadowrealm. We are connected, my twin and I, by bonds similar to those which undoubtedly exist between you and your brother. I have always known when she was in pain, when she was hurt or hungry or frightened.…”  
  
  Sophie found herself nodding. She had felt her brother’s pain at times: when he had broken his ribs playing football, she’d felt the sting in her side, and when he’d nearly drowned in Hawaii, she’d woken up breathless and gasping. When she’d dislocated her shoulder in tae kwan do, her brother’s shoulder had swelled up and discolored with a bruise that matched hers precisely.  
  
  Aoife barked a question in rapid-fire Japanese, and the driver answered with a single syllable. Then she turned to Sophie. “We can stand here and talk in the street,” she said, smiling, flashing the tips of her canines, “or you can invite me inside and we can talk in comfort.”  
  
  A tiny alarm bell went off at the back of Sophie’s head. Vampires could not cross a threshold unless they’d been invited to do so, and she instantly knew she was not going to invite this vampire into her aunt’s house. There was something about her.… Slowly and deliberately, Sophie allowed the remainder of the memories that had been crowding at the back of her head to come surging forward. Suddenly—shockingly—she knew everything the Witch of Endor knew about Aoife of the Shadows. The images and memories were terrifying. Eyes wide with horror, Sophie took a step back, away from the creature, realizing just in time that the driver was behind her. Immediately, she reached for the trigger tattoo on her wrist, but the man caught her arms, holding them to her sides, before she could make the connection. Aoife stepped forward, caught Sophie’s wrists and twisted them to expose the design Saint-Germain had burned into her flesh. Sophie tried to struggle, but the driver held her tightly, squeezing her arms so hard that she could feel her fingers begin to tingle. “Let me go! Josh will—”  
  
  “Your twin is powerless.” Aoife pulled off one leather glove and took the girl’s hand in her cold fingers. Filthy gray smoke coiled off the vampire’s pale skin. She rubbed her thumb across the ornate Celtic-looking band that wrapped around Sophie’s wrist, and stopped on the underside at the gold circle with a red dot in the center. “Ah, the sign of tine. The Mark of Fire,” Aoife said softly. “So you would have tried to burn me?”  
  
  “Let me go!” Sophie tried to kick out at the man holding her, but his grip on her arms tightened and she suddenly grew frightened. Even the Witch of Endor was wary of Aoife of the Shadows. The vampire turned Sophie’s wrist painfully and bent forward to examine the tattoo. “This is the work of a master. Who gave you this … gift?” Her lips curled in disgust as she said the word.  
  
  Sophie pressed her lips together. She wasn’t telling this woman anything.  
  
  Aoife’s glasses slipped down her nose, revealing eyes that were like chips of green glass. “Maui … Prometheus … Xolotl … Pele … Agni …” Aoife shook her head quickly. “No, none of those. You have just returned from Paris, so it is someone in that city.…” Her voice trailed away. She looked over Sophie’s shoulder at the black-suited driver. “Is there a Master of Fire in the French capital?”  
  
  “Your old adversary, the count, lives there,” the man said softly in English.  
  
  “Saint-Germain,” Aoife snapped. She saw Sophie’s eyes widen and she smiled savagely. “Saint-Germain the liar. Saint-Germain the thief. I should have killed him when I had the chance.” She looked at the driver. “Take her. We will continue this conversation in private.”  
  
  Sophie opened her mouth to scream, but Aoife pressed her forefinger to the bridge of the girl’s nose. The vampire’s gray aura leaked from her fingers, the smoke curling around the girl’s head, seeping into her nostrils and mouth.  
  
  Sophie tried to bring her own aura alight. It crackled faintly about her body for a single heartbeat before she slumped unconscious.  
  
  CHAPTER FOUR  
  
  Agnes hit a speed-dial number on the phone and handed it to Josh. “You speak to your parents, right now,” she ordered. “And where is Sophie? Who is that girl she’s talking to outside?”  
  
  “The sister of someone we know,” Josh said, pressing the phone to the side of his face. The line rang only once before it was answered.  
  
  “Agnes?”  
  
  “Dad! It’s Josh.”  
  
  “Josh!”  
  
  The boy found himself smiling—the relief in his father’s voice was clearly audible—and then a wave of embarrassment washed over him and he felt guilty for not getting in touch with his parents sooner.  
  
  “Is everything all right?” Richard Newman’s voice was almost lost in a crackle of burbling static.  
  
  Josh pressed his finger to his ear and concentrated hard on the sounds. “Everything is fine, Dad. We’re OK. We just got back to San Francisco.”  
  
  “Your mother and I were starting to get worried about you. Seriously worried.”  
  
  “We were with the Fla—Flemings,” Josh quickly corrected himself. “There was no cell-phone reception,” he added truthfully, “though we did manage to get your e-mail on Sunday night. I got the jpeg of the shark teeth. I didn’t recognize the type, but from the size, I’m guessing a freshwater shark?” he asked quickly, deliberately changing the subject.  
  
  “Well done, son. It’s a Lissodus from the Upper Cretaceous period. It’s in very nice condition too.”  
  
  “Is everything OK with you?” Josh pressed on, trying to keep his father talking. He glanced at the door, wishing his sister would come in. He could distract his father with questions, but the same trick wouldn’t work with his mother, and he guessed that she was hovering at his father’s shoulder and would pluck the phone from his fingers at any moment. “How’s the dig going?”  
  
  “It’s been great.” Wind howled at the other end of the line, and dust and grit crackled against the phone. “We discovered what we think is a new ceratopsid.”  
  
  Josh frowned. The name was familiar. When he’d been younger, he used to know the names of hundreds of dinosaurs. “Is that a horned dinosaur?” he asked.  
  
  “Yes, from the Cretaceous, about seventy-five million years old. We also found a small and possibly untouched Anasazi site in one of the canyons, and some extraordinary Fremont-culture petroglyphs outside of the Range Creek Canyon site.”  
  
  Smiling at his father’s bubbling enthusiasm, Josh walked toward the window. “Which race are called the Ancient Ones in Navajo?” he asked, although he already knew the answer. “Fremont or Anasazi?” He wanted to keep his father talking, to give Sophie more time.  
  
   
“Anasazi,” Richard Newman said. “And actually, the proper translation is ‘Enemy Ancestors.’”  
  
  The two words shocked Josh to a standstill. A couple of days ago, the name would have meant nothing to him, but that was before he’d learned of the existence of the Elders, the race who had ruled the world in the distant past. He had come to realize that there was more than a grain of truth to every myth and legend. “Enemy Ancestors,” he repeated, trying to keep his voice steady. “What does that mean?”  
  
  “I don’t know,” Richard Newman said, “but I prefer the term Ancient or Ancestral Pueblo or Hisatsinom.”  
  
  “But it’s such a strange name,” Josh persisted. “Who do you think used it? They wouldn’t have referred to themselves that way.”  
  
  “Probably another tribe. Strangers, outsiders.”  
  
  “And who came before them, Dad?” Josh said quickly. “Who came before the Anasazi and the Fremont?”  
  
  “We don’t know,” his father admitted. “That’s known as the Archaic period. Why the sudden interest in ancient America? I thought archaeology bored you.

1mwixic,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1mwixic/travel_memoir_fiction_very_first_draft_thoughts/,"Travel Memoir -> Fiction! Very First Draft, Thoughts & Feedback?","Hi all! Earlier this year, I took an 8-week solo trip across Europe, and it was the greatest experience of my life! It taught me so much that I've been itching to see it manifest in some physical/ creative form. I was debating using it as my inspiration to delve into a new professional field via a Master's or enter a PhD program, but that's just not fiscally realistic for me right now. I've been looking for a novel that takes place in the places I traveled to revisit that time and have come up dry, so, with the inspiration to do *something* long rattling around in my brain, I thought that maybe I could write about it? 

What you'll find below is a **first** first draft; A train of consciousness if you will. I have the entire plot/structure in mind already, as I'm just going to write my experience as I remember it, but fictionalized for detail/interest. I know that there is much to be edited below, but what I'm looking for is just more of any thoughts/feedback/if you think I have anything here? Or if this type of book doesn't exist for a reason haha. I hope this type of pitch is allowed, and TIA for any thoughts/ feedback!

  


>The new Boeing 787s have dimming windows. Far gone are the archaic days of window shades; fighting with your neighbor over the light seeping in to Row 27. When the plane departs at night, you have no control over the opacity of your window; all of a sudden, it just begins to brighten showing the whole new world soon to be at your fingertips. It’s comical really, how metaphorical it all is, its similarity to being truly reborn. How fast your world can go from the ordinary, to the vast expanse of rolling Tuscan hills as the become the rolling blue waters off the coast of the Lazio region. The last time she looked out this small window, what she saw was the blinking light of the plane wing as it began it’s departure from New York City at 12:37 AM. This was what she imagined it had felt like to see the *Wizard of Oz* in theatres 86 years ago. The raw emotion of seeing in Technicolor for the first time; how Dorothy felt seeing in color for the first time. 

>Fiona leaned back in her cramped budget airline seat, allowing those in her row to sneak a peek out the window as well, as she blinked out against the sudden harsh sun. Who were these two strangers she had just spent six hours cuddled up next to? Was this their first time seeing the Land of Oz as well? Or perhaps, they were returning from a trip to America, and this was their ordinary? While the plane continued its steady descent, she took note of the horse farms and lush greenery that stood in stark contrast to the life she’d just left behind. She took dozens of photos to send to her family, though she’d never actually look at them again. Returning to this moment, the beginning of it all, she’d find, would come to hurt too much.

>*“Signore e signori*, the crackle of the plane's intercom grabbed her attention from their shadowy winged reflection against the lapping waters of the Mediterranean, *“Benvenuti in Italia. Benvenuti a Roma, la Città Eterna.”* Her stomach gurggled, hearing the unfamiliar words for the first time. She continued to look out into this alien world she had found herself in. A slight smirk graced her lips, she couldn’t help but be amused by whatever had gotten into her to land in this position.

>Six hours ago, she was in the corner of Terminal 4, JFK. They say get to the airport three hours early for an International flight, and she always did. Call her an airport dad, but she enjoyed the liminal space that was an Airport. Time wasn’t real, a beer at 6am was just as normal as tying your shoes. However, nobody reminds you that the airport does in fact close, and you end up paying $17 for Cheez-Itz and watching the families you stood next to in TSA wrangle their young.

>Eight hours ago, she was lugging her suitcase to 42nd street and Lex, standing outside *Cipriani* waiting for her Uber shuttle to arrive. She talked to her mom about how her life was never going to be the same again, “Who needs Mars”, she joked.

>One day ago, she was packing.

>Two days ago, she was sitting in her favorite midtown coffee shop enveloped in the deep deep folds of a worn leather chair. Pieces of her $7 PB&J cinnamon bun were still stuck to her fingertips, she’d come here to work on her LinkedIn profile. Instead, she found herself staring at her computer screen in a mix of shock, horror, humor, and awe. Her Discover card laid haphazardly on the arm of the chair. She picked up her phone to capture the look on her face, “So,” she said to the video that would soon be on her Instagram story announcing her predicament to the world (the 27 people on her close friends story). 

>There on her computer screen read the words: 

>**“Confirmation of Purchase: JFK to FCO. One-Way”**

>The pilot came back onto the intercom, his gravely voice began speaking English, though his words were laced with his heavy Italian accent. 

>“Ladies and gentleman. Welcome to Italy. Welcome to Rome, The Eternal City.”

\----

>I don’t recall exactly what time it was when the plane finally touched down. 9 AM? 4 PM? Time zones and the numerical processing of it all escapes me. But eventually, the plane did land. I don’t recall all of the details of disembarking and collecting my luggage. I remember getting changed in a cramped bathroom, my Alo set was acceptable for the journey but I wouldn’t be caught dead looking *American* now. I recall trying to figure out how to purchase my train ticket to Roma Termini, a small flush gracing my cheeks when I pressed “English” on the ticketing machine. 

>I don’t know why we, as Americans, tend to try to instantaneously assimilate in a foreign country. Why, when people automatically assume you hold an EU passport before opening your mouth your chest puffs up with pride. Is it due to the current political climate, the stereotypes of Americans, the desire to be part of the glittery, shiny, opalescent utopia that is Europe? 

>With my ticket in one hand and my matching overpriced luggage set in the other, I found my way onto the sticky, quiet train. It was only March 31st, but oh, it felt like a sticky June day. The train slowly pulled out of the airport station, and we began our journey to Oz. I shed my coat and stuffed my daily Adderall into my mouth, taking silly selfies and photos to send to my friends back home. I couldn’t stop quietly giggling to myself, had I really just done this? 

>Before March 5th, 26 days ago, I’d never left America. Puerto Rico once, Spring of 2021. Tickets were dirt cheap thanks to COVID. I was almost abducted on Vieques, and then caught my ex cheating on the drive back to my college apartment. I’d been to Arizona, Texas, Indiana for work. New England to visit family. I’d even lived in a central Florida town so rural I was ostracized for having a college degree. But 26 days ago I left America for the first time. I flew to Paris, with my mother. We had a whirlwind 7 days. Paris, London, Dublin. Flying home a week later, I almost got stuck overnight in Madrid, but I made it back to the US in one piece. It was the week of a lifetime, my mother and I had never been closer. I even got her to take her first shot ever, thanks to a Lehigh frat boy who offered to buy us a shot in Temple Bar. But I came home, basked in the glory of my adventure, and got ready to get back to work. 

>I had on a handwoven Irish knit sweater as I walked into my first meeting back. It was navy overed in cute little sheep, with one black one on the side; inspired by Diana of course. I couldn’t wait to get back to work, pay my dues, and earn my next trip overseas. Then I got fired.

>So, now here I was. 18 or so days later, pulling into Roma Termini station. With $18,000 to my name, six figures of student debt, an apartment back home that would be costing me $2k a month whether I lived there or not, and a map of my trip (which quickly fell to the wayside). It was fine, though I told myself, my father, my best friend, whose dad was guaranteeing our overpriced luxury apartment.

> “I booked a one-way, but I have a one-way return flight booked I’ll be back soon!” *(Lie).* 

>“I’m only going to spend $2,000. $3k max.” *(Lie).* 

>“I’m going to apply for jobs the whole time I’m traveling! Why apply in NYC and be sad when I can apply in the Swiss Alps!” *(My laptop actually broke at the gate while I was waiting to board. Lie, but I like to pretend I would have otherwise.)*

>“I’ll have enough money to get through the rest of the lease even if I don’t get a job, which I easily will!” *(I’m still unemployed; it’s been 6 months. So... You guessed it)*",1,1755800541.0,writers,1,1.0,False
