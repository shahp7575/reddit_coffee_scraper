A couple of hours later, decided to sleep a bit more. I wasn’t staying in bed while awake. Actually, drank coffee and moved around the house a lot. After this additional sleep, the overall ""time in bed"" increased, as well as the awake time and the sleep score lowered significantly. Why does the time asleep in mornings considered as a prolongation of the night sleep and not as a nap? It happens every time for the sleeps before 12pm and is a little bit frustrating.

In the heart of a city filled with hustle and bustle, *Chunkle Café* stands as a haven of warmth, familiarity, and creative indulgence. Not just another coffee shop, this quirky, offbeat café offers an escape from the ordinary. Its name, *Chunkle*, might evoke a smile or a raised eyebrow at first, but once you step inside, it all makes sense. From the carefully crafted menu to the eclectic design, everything about Chunkle Café is a celebration of nostalgia, creativity, and the kind of food that feels like a hug in a bowl. The best part? It’s a place where everyone feels like family, whether you’re there to chat with friends or escape into the world of your favorite novel.

But what exactly makes Chunkle Café so special? It’s more than just coffee and pastries—it’s a celebration of the unexpected, where comfort food gets a modern twist, and every corner of the café tells a story. Let’s take a deeper dive into what sets this community gem apart.

# The Birth of Chunkle Café: A Leap of Faith

The story of Chunkle Café began with a leap of faith and a shared dream. Founded by *Elliot Turner* and *Lila Harrington*, the café was born out of a mutual love for food, travel, and the simple joys of everyday life. Neither of them came from the typical background of seasoned restaurateurs or café owners; in fact, they had spent much of their careers in completely different fields. Elliot had a background in graphic design, while Lila was a freelance writer. However, their paths converged over a shared passion for food and a desire to create something truly unique.

“We didn’t want to create just another café,” says Lila, looking around the café with pride. “We wanted to build a space that felt like a home away from home—a place where people could come as they are, relax, and truly enjoy the little moments.”

And so, after months of planning, sketching ideas, and securing a location in a charming neighborhood with a strong sense of community, Chunkle Café came to life. The name itself came from an inside joke between the couple—an amusing term they used to describe the comfort food they’d experiment with while traveling. ""Chunkle"" became a symbol of their shared vision: to take classic comfort food, add a little bit of whimsy, and present it in a way that felt both nostalgic and fresh.

# An Atmosphere Like No Other: Warmth and Whimsy

As soon as you step through the door, it’s clear that Chunkle Café is not your typical coffeehouse. It has a warm, inviting vibe that feels like stepping into someone’s cozy living room—if that living room had exposed brick walls, floor-to-ceiling windows letting in natural light, and mismatched yet charming furniture that beckons you to stay a while. The café’s design is a mix of vintage and modern, with elements like mismatched chairs, a large chalkboard wall featuring daily specials in colorful chalk, and an open kitchen where patrons can watch the magic unfold.

One of the most striking features is the “Chunkle Wall” near the café’s entrance. This mural, created by a local artist, tells the story of comfort food through whimsical illustrations of oversized burgers, bowls of soup, and cups of coffee. The vibrant colors and playful details invite you to explore, and there’s always something new to notice, no matter how many times you visit.

Whether you’re perched at one of the high-top tables by the window, curled up on a plush armchair in the corner, or sharing a long communal table with friends, Chunkle Café feels like a space that was designed with intention. It’s not just a place to grab a cup of coffee and go—it’s a place to linger, reflect, and connect.

**The Menu: Where Nostalgia Meets Innovation**

While the atmosphere might draw you in, it’s the menu that keeps you coming back. Chunkle Café’s food offerings are a fusion of the familiar and the unexpected, with an emphasis on local, fresh ingredients and dishes that are designed to make you feel good, inside and out.

**Coffee with a Personal Touch**

At the heart of the café is its coffee—a product that Elliot and Lila have spent years perfecting. The café’s coffee menu is a thoughtful mix of the classics and the unconventional, with each drink crafted to showcase the rich, deep flavors of locally sourced beans. Their signature brew, the Chunkle Brew, is a smooth, bold dark roast with notes of caramel and dark chocolate, perfect for the discerning coffee lover.

For those seeking something a little different, the Pumpkin Spice Affogato—a seasonal favorite—combines the richness of espresso with a creamy scoop of pumpkin ice cream, topped with a drizzle of caramel. And for the true adventurers, there’s the Bacon Bourbon Latte, a smoky, savory twist on the classic latte with a hint of bourbon and a crispy strip of bacon for garnish.

Lila insists that the key to their coffee success lies in the small batch, hand-roasted beans they use. “We source our beans from local roasters who share our commitment to quality,” she explains.Every cup is meticulously crafted to bring out the distinct character and nuances of the beans. It’s like a little work of art in every cup.”

**Hearty, Hearty, and More Hearty: The Food Menu**

When it comes to food, Chunkle Café embraces the concept of “hearty” without ever veering into the realm of greasy or unhealthy. The café specializes in dishes that comfort the soul, with an emphasis on balanced flavors and fresh ingredients. There’s something undeniably homey about the menu—it’s as if the dishes are an ode to the comfort food your grandmother used to make, but with a creative twist that reflects the contemporary tastes of today.

Start your day with the *Chunkle Classic Breakfast*—a plate stacked high with scrambled eggs, roasted potatoes, sautéed greens, and a warm slice of sourdough toast. It’s a simple, satisfying way to kick off the morning. For those with a sweet tooth, the *Cinnamon Swirl Pancakes* are a must-try, drizzled with maple syrup and topped with a dollop of whipped cream.

If you’re in the mood for lunch, the *Chunkle Club Sandwich* will hit the spot. It’s made with freshly roasted turkey, smoked bacon, avocado, and homemade aioli, served on toasted whole-grain bread. But it’s not all about sandwiches—the *Vegetable & Quinoa Bowl*, featuring roasted seasonal vegetables, quinoa, and a tangy tahini dressing, is a lighter yet equally satisfying choice.

Chunkle Café isn’t just about breakfast and lunch. The café’s *Dinner Nights* are becoming a beloved tradition, where patrons can enjoy a rotating menu of homemade comfort food, from *Beef Stew with Cheddar Biscuits* to *Chicken Pot Pie*. There’s also a rotating selection of homemade soups served with buttery garlic bread, the perfect antidote for a chilly evening.

For dessert, the *Chunkle Chocolate Cake* is an undeniable favorite—dense, rich, and decadent with layers of smooth ganache. Paired with a *Vanilla Bean Latte*, it’s the kind of treat that will make you close your eyes and savor every bite.

# A Place for Special Diets

Chunkle Café is also known for being particularly accommodating to dietary preferences. Whether you're vegan, gluten-free, or have any number of food sensitivities, the team is more than happy to offer alternatives. The *Vegan Mac & Cheese* is a favorite, made with a creamy cashew-based sauce that’s just as satisfying as the dairy version. Similarly, their gluten-free *Avocado Toast* is a crowd pleaser, made on fresh gluten-free bread and topped with a zesty chili-lime dressing.

The café offers plant-based milk options, including almond, oat, and coconut milk, ensuring that everyone can enjoy their favorite drinks without compromise.

# Beyond the Food: The Culture of Connection

But beyond the food and drinks, Chunkle Café is about something deeper—a culture of connection and community. The couple’s vision has always been to create a space where people can gather, exchange ideas, and feel like they’re part of something larger than themselves.

To foster this environment, Chunkle Café frequently hosts events such as open mic nights, community book clubs, and “Local Artist Thursdays,” where local musicians and creators are invited to share their work. These events aren’t just about entertainment—they’re about building relationships and offering a platform for creative expression.

The café has also formed meaningful partnerships with local charities, providing meals to homeless shelters and organizing community food drives. For Elliot and Lila, these initiatives hold just as much importance as offering exceptional food.

“We aim for our café to be more than just a stop for coffee,” says Elliot.  “Let me know if you'd like more variations or further adjustments!



**The Future of Chunkle Café: Growing with the Times**



As Chunkle Café continues to grow in popularity, Elliot and Lila remain focused on staying true to their mission. While they’re exploring the possibility of opening additional locations, their goal is always to maintain the personal, intimate feeling that defines the café. They are constantly evolving the menu, introducing seasonal offerings and new twists on old favorites, but always with the same commitment to quality and creativity.

Their dream is to make Chunkle Café a place where you can’t help but feel at home, whether you’re grabbing a quick cup of coffee or.

Now I know what some of you are no doubt thinking, it sounds a little too... rural.  I have a solution for that.  We need to find a way to pour in massive capital that will be a magnet for liberals.  Get a bunch of elite ivy league universities and top public colleges to create a combined overflow college where professors from those colleges rotate in and out at this satellite college.  Construction and buildout can radiate out from there and we can grant stipends to people who stay in the area each year up to 5 years and for people to come there and build.  Bring starbucks, coffee bean, whatever other amenities to make Montana a liberal oasis.  We can build defenses if the locals try to run us out.

  
I'm basically a hermit, all I need is gig+ fiber and some coffee shops.

  
Now the main issue is that this liberal honey trap will bring some conservatives too, we can't prevent that entirely.  But we can just keep growing until the difference gets us the votes we need and build a modern city in Montana in the process.

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response—or lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly—the Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

**Response to Prompt 27: Symbolism**

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

**Response to Prompt 33: Catachresis**

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me—an eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed—a pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1731058217.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

1gmehs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Pretty_Reaction4626/comments/1gmehs7/effective_ways_of_managing_waste_in_apartments/,Effective Ways of Managing Waste in Apartments,"Managing waste in an apartment is essential for keeping our living spaces clean and environmentally friendly. As cities grow, so does the amount of waste produced, making good waste management strategies increasingly important. Simple efforts such as waste sorting, reducing single-use items, and composting can have a significant impact. Residents can help ensure that more materials are recycled and less waste ends up in landfills by sorting recyclables from normal trash. Reducing single-use products such as plastic bags and cutlery promotes a more sustainable lifestyle. Composting food scraps can convert trash into fertilizer for plants. Getting to know your neighbors and sharing waste management strategies can help the community work together more effectively. Overall, little measures performed by apartment residents can lead to a cleaner environment and a healthier neighborhood.



**1. Separate Waste into Categories**



* Recycling :Create properly labeled containers for various recyclable materials such as plastic, glass, paper, and metal. Many recycling programs demand that goods be clean, so rinse containers before depositing them in the bins. Clean recyclables prevent contamination and boost their chances of being recycled.
* Organic Waste:Use a small compost bin to collect kitchen scraps such as fruit peels, vegetable cuttings, and eggshells. Even if you don't have a garden, compact indoor composters are available that take up little space and produce nutrient-rich compost that may be used to fertilize potted plants or donated to community gardens.
* General waste :Set aside one bin for materials that are not recyclable or biodegradable. Separating this garbage from recyclables and compostable ensures that each form of waste is correctly treated and reduces contamination in recycling streams.



**2.Reduce Single-Use Items**



To reduce waste, avoid using single-use goods such as plastic bags, disposable cutlery, and straws. Instead, choose reusable options like cloth bags, stainless steel or glass containers, and metal straws. Making these easy changes will drastically reduce the amount of plastic and other debris that ends up in landfills and seas. Furthermore, utilizing reusable items not only benefits the environment but also save you money in the long run by eliminating the need to replace disposable products on a regular basis.

  


**3. Composting** 

Composting is a simple and effective approach to reduce kitchen waste by converting it into nutrient-rich soil for plants. You can put up a tiny compost bin in your flat to collect organic waste such as fruit and vegetable peels, coffee grounds, and eggshells. These materials decompose naturally over time, producing compost that can be used in the garden or with houseplants. For the best results, balance your green waste (such as fruit leftovers) and brown garbage (such as dried leaves). Composting helps to minimize trash in landfills and promotes a healthier environment, making it an excellent option for sustainable living.

  


4. **Avoid Paper Waste**



Reducing paper waste is simple and can make a significant difference. To eliminate unneeded printing, start by converting to digital bills and statements, taking notes with apps, and purchasing e-books and digital subscriptions. When you do need to print, attempt to use both sides of the page. To save waste, reuse scratch paper for lists or reminders and use cloth napkins instead of paper ones. Avoid printed receipts if feasible, recycle any old paper, and select products with little packaging. These minor improvements can help maintain your flat clean and environmentally friendly.

  


5. **Declutter Regularly** 

Regular decluttering of your residence is an excellent strategy to manage waste and keep your area organized. Set aside time every few months to go through your stuff and remove anything you no longer use or use. Instead of throwing things away, consider donating usable goods, recycling what you can, or finding new uses for them. Decluttering not only eliminates trash, but it also makes your living space cleaner and more tranquil, making it simpler to enjoy the things you genuinely value. Furthermore, it helps you be more conscious of what you bring into your home in the future.

  
  


6. **Bulk in Buying**

Buying in bulk is a great strategy to cut waste and save money. It reduces packaging waste because larger amounts typically require less packaging than several smaller goods. Residents can utilize reusable containers to store bulk supplies, significantly reducing trash. Bulk buying also encourages planning ahead of time, which helps to reduce food waste by purchasing only what is needed. Participating in community bulk buying programs can also help residents combine their resources and save money. By focusing on core commodities with lengthy shelf lives, such as grains and beans, residents may make sustainable choices while reaping the benefits of bulk buying.

  
  


**7. Use- Friendly Products**

  

Purchasing eco-friendly items is a simple approach to help the environment and minimize waste. These products are often made from natural, biodegradable, or recycled materials, making them environmentally friendly. For example, you can use biodegradable soaps for cleaning, bamboo toothbrushes for personal hygiene, and products with minimum or recyclable packaging. Supporting firms that value sustainability reduces waste while also encouraging others to make environmentally beneficial choices. Using eco-friendly items in your daily life helps to create a healthier planet for everyone.

  
  


8. **Use Cloth Bags Instead of Plastic Bags**



Moving   from plastic to cloth bags is an easy and practical strategy to decrease plastic waste. Cloth bags are long-lasting, reusable, and may be used for a variety of reasons, including grocery shopping and carrying personal things. Unlike plastic bags, which frequently wind up in landfills or seas, cloth bags can be washed and reused for many years, making them an environmentally beneficial option. Many establishments even provide incentives or discounts for utilizing reusable bags. Making this tiny modification helps to clean up the environment while also lowering single-use plastic usage.



9. **Awareness and Education**



Raising awareness of trash management is critical in an apartment community. Begin by arranging informational  campaigns, such as workshops and flyers, to teach residents about recycling, composting, and trash reduction. This helps everyone realize how they can contribute. Encourage residents to participate in waste reduction efforts by organizing community clean-ups or recycling drives. Recognizing people that engage through newsletters or social media can encourage others to join in. By combining education and active participation, you can create a more sustainable and cleaner living environment for all.



**10. Dispose of Hazardous Waste Properly**

To prevent harm to the environment and human health, hazardous trash must be disposed of correctly. Batteries, devices, and chemicals all be hazardous if discarded carelessly. 

* Identify Hazardous Waste: To properly dispose of hazardous waste, it's crucial to identify the specific objects that are harmful. 

* Batteries:  contain heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, and mercury, which can contaminate the land and water.
* Electronics: Old electronics, such as smartphones, computers, and televisions, frequently contain hazardous materials such as lead and cadmium.
* Chemicals: Household cleaners, paints, insecticides, and automotive fluids can be harmful and should never be poured down the drain or discarded.

* Find Local Disposal options: To dispose of hazardous material, contact your local waste management organization. Many communities have designated drop-off locations for these products.
* Store Waste safely : To properly store hazardous materials, keep them in their original containers, away from children and pets, and in a cold, dry place.
* Spread Awareness : Share information about safe hazardous waste disposal with your friends and family. This will help more individuals comprehend its significance.

11. **Segregation at Source:**

* separate bins: Effective trash management requires distinct bins for different sorts of waste. You should have separate bins for dry waste (plastics and paper) and wet waste (food scraps and organic stuff). Placing these bins in convenient locations, such as common areas and near kitchens, encourages residents to properly dispose of their waste. Making it easier to sort rubbish encourages everyone to help keep the apartment clean and promotes recycling and composting initiatives.
* Color-Coding : Color-coding waste bins is an excellent approach for homeowners to readily identify the appropriate bin for their waste, hence simplifying the segregation process. 

* Blue Bin for Recyclables

* This bin is designated for dry waste that can be recycled.
* Common things include plastic bottles, metal cans, glass jars, newspapers, cardboard, and other recyclable materials.
* Using a blue bin reminds homeowners that they should only store goods that can be recycled, which helps to keep recyclable materials clean.

* Green Bin for Wet Waste (Compost)

* This bin is meant for organic waste that can decompose.
* Fruit and vegetable scraps, eggshells, coffee grounds, garden debris (such as leaves and grass clippings), and other biodegradable items are appropriate for this category.
*  A green bin promotes composting, which lowers garbage transported to landfills while generating nutrient-dense compost for gardening.

  


* Black Bin for General Waste

* This bin collects non-recyclable and non-compostable waste  
* collects plastic wrappers, broken household goods, and other debris that cannot be recycled or composted.
* Using a black bin allows residents to distinguish what should be dumped as general waste, reducing the possibility of putting recyclable or compostable products in the wrong bin. 



By implementing these waste management practices, apartment members may help to create a cleaner, greener neighborhood while decreasing their environmental effect. Small modifications in daily behaviors can lead to large gains in waste management, resulting in a healthier living environment for all.

lately, she had been saying she felt really really anxious. She’s at a shit point in life atm - finished uni and stuck working in a coffee shop with no idea what she wants to do in life. She’s stressed about a whole bunch of stuff, so i assumed she was anxious about that. 

I continuously checked up on her and asked what she was anxious about - she always talked about her job and still not being able to drive etc 

yesterday she lets me know that she’s anxious about us - took me a bit by surprise. She wanted to chat and it ended up with us breaking up. i won’t go into detail but it was honestly really wishy washy stuff. 

I drove her back home - the whole time, she kept saying

“this doesn’t feel right” 

“it’s not even a big thing and we’ve broke up, it doesn’t feel right”

Then why tf did you break up with me?

She’s done this a few times this year and each time previous, we got back cause i love her but honestly, i can’t do that again. 

I love her but i have this anxious feeling she’ll out break up with me out of nowhere, realise she fucked up, then try to come back.

Hey so I know everyone's neck deep in political posts here and doubtless it'll continue in the coming days and months. What I want to address in this post is the feeling expressed by many that the outcome of the election has solidified their feelings about their church community and to varying extents Christianity itself. If you sincerely feel that your church is now lost and given into forces that are incompatible with your values then I don't see any reason not to leave. That's what I did more than a decade ago during the Bush years.



I was raised in in the church, my family volunteered, hosted bible study, I was a camp counselor, and a small gorup leader. I went to a private Christian school and read the bible cover to cover multiple times. I was a boy scout, and was raised in a very red district and was taught to see Regan style conservatism as the only real valid christian position. At first I believed that America's role in the world was positive and indeed God ordained. My family while consistently conservative in politics still taught me to love others. My father balked at hateful statements being made about gay people. My mother who had family members placed in concentration camps in the eastern sierras was openly dismayed when conservative pundits defended those policies when they were compared to Bush's treatment of Muslims. Like a lot of teenagers I had issues with self-worth but found comfort in my faith and in the life and teachings of Christ. If I remained steadfast in the belief that God loved all, and if I could believe that, then I didn't have to see myself as deficient or worthless because that's not how God saw me or the least among me. 



 I was also very much a new junkie, still am, and I followed the wars in the aftermath of 9/11 closely. From the pulpit and my circles at church, things were unified around a message that the wars on terror was a godly one and that the weak willed liberals were in the wrong for bringing up things like human rights or war crimes. But to me, seeing the videos leaked showing american attack helicopters blowing up ambulances and mowing down people in the streets. I couldn't square that circle. I was very civically engaged and believed full-heartedly that the rights afforded to American citizens were God given rights to all people. I couldn't read the sermon on the mount or Christ's parables and support the war. I couldn't say that I was willing to treat muslims or gay people as less than because I knew the gospels backwards and forwards, and knew deep down that my faith did not excuse ignorance or complacency. I couldn't just hand wave away lies and slander towards whole groups of people. I wasn't affirming yet but I couldn't follow the logic of denying civic rights to gay people, if we were indeed equal under the law.



It took me some time. I admit I felt very lost for a long time. I went away for university, but felt increasingly astranged from the typical church spaces I used to inhabit. I had a close friend who I knew was gay and my own family's history of being in japanese internment camps. And that made just standing around at coffee hour after church hearing all kind of unfiltered hatred towards gays and muslims made me sick to the stomach. It was hard, for most of my life church was home, it's where I made friends, it's where I found a sense of belonging and comfort. But it was no longer that, so I left. 



One day I was down a wikipedia rabbit hole when I first started to encounter articles about historic Christian responses to war. Being a bit of a history nerd, I was aware of groups in the US like the Quakers and the work of MLK, but getting bit more broad I read about groups like the anabaptists and liberation theology from latin america. The later I dismissed as communists at first, but the ideas of the radical reformation felt validating and especially their links to the early church fathers who were sharply critical of the roman empire and it's militarism and violence. This searching also led me to Leo Tolstoy, yes the guy who wrote War and Peace (still haven't finished it). In Tolstoy's later life the once nhilitistic Tolstoy noted the faith of the peasents among him and re-examined Christ's teachings. Tolstoy was particularly struck by the Sermon on the Mount and it's radical meanings when taken at face value. I read from cover to cover, Tolstoy's The Kingdom of God Is Within You and found that much of his critiques of church state fusion, militarism, retributive justice, and the state itself a perfect companion to the struggles I myself had at the time. The book is dense but if anything I would recommend the final chapters where Tolstoy documents how the Russian State and Church had inflicted evil upon it's people (and still does today).  Tolstoy being the good writer that he is lays into the outright hypocrisy and evil that arises when the powers that be pit people against each other with lies and violent rhetoric. Tolstoy points to Chrsit's example and commandments to love one another and to deny the validity of violence as a tool. A literal and honest application of Christ's teachings is what is required of a Christian and if that means to defy the church and/or the state then that's the path Christ has laid out, that's the path of love and compassion that will sustain us all. And it was that message that still moves me forward today and I hope can move you forward as well. 



The main points and message of what Tolstoy was writing about felt every bit as relevant today as it did back in Russia during the late 19th century. For me reading Tolstoy in the midst of the financial crash of the later 2000s and it's aftermath was the road to Damascus meeting I had to have with Christ. Since then through days of doubt, sorrow, disbelief, and radical belief I am still someone growing in faith. But I am far past the Dominionism (or as it's commonly called Christian Nationalism) of my former community and I would encourage everyone to do the work of moving forward as well. None of this is new, the prophets of old in Israel were frequently attacked for advocating for the God's love and justice. Christ was politically transgression and His teachings on the Kingdom of God where the last shall be first, and first shall be last, where accurately seen at His time as a direct threat to a religious establishment. That like nearly all establishments was hypocritical and cared only for power. The apostle Paul once a figure who opposed Christ's universal message, was transformed into it's greatest champion. And in Paul we see a model of someone who in reexamining his religious roots could identify the truth and could do away with the chaff. What is Christianity other than a shift from the hypocritical and unworkable forms of religion as it was practiced at the time? Deconstruction is a necessary part of Reformation. There's a reason why Christ consistently puts forth his teachings in relation to what had come before. We all inherit a world that is broken and in need of healing. But what was once worn and broken can be transformed in Christ back to which reorients to the truth: love of neighbor is tied to love of God. You cannot have one and not the other, even if you might get some supreme court nominations in the process. 



I get it, you might feel tired, you might feel despondent. There's plenty of Pslams for that. I am praying for you those who are in the direct line threat from a second Trump administration. I hope the work I aim to do will bring justice and deliverance though I am just one guy. And I ask for your forgiveness that I have not done enough to be the salt that is needed to create a just and peaceful world for all. But if people like Toyohiko Kagawa can continue the Christian mission even from prison, we can too. I can't promise you that your next church will be big, fancy, have job networking opportunities, big social functions, and not wracked by constant budgetary problems. But I pray that you find one that preaches the Gospel which is good news for all the people. Regardless of papers, sexual orientation, gender, or the countless ways we seek to divide and scapegoat one another the only viable path for us is together. Look to Christ, the only thing Christ ever excluded was the concept of exclusion itself. The church must be a home for all, and if it isn't then dust the sandals off your feet, calmly state your concerns and move on. The cost of discipleship is high, but in the end as Christ said ""My yoke is easy, and my burdens light"". Practice compassion and love towards others, and you'll see that life on the other side is easier. 



So yeah, none of this is new. Regimes come and go, but you can be a part of undoing wrongs and realizing the world Christ preached. Be the hands and feet of the body of Christ, even if the powers that be seek to co-opt religious imagery for it's own hateful purposes. Sadly many would rather see you leave and remain despondent while they continue their evil work. Don't grant them that, there's too much work to be done. ",2,1731056941.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

I’m at the end of Act 2 and just really needed to vent somewhere. The more I think about it, the more I’m convinced he got seriously butchered as a character.

Lucanis is cool and had such potential to be so much more than what he turned out to be. The writers had so much to work with and yet, the fact that he’s Antivan; the fact that he’s a Crow (not to mention having the chance to develop everything that Zevran had already set up with his stories in DAO about their faction); hell, EVEN the fact that he has A DEMON inside of him; EVERYTHING is completely glossed over. 

It seems like the writers actively chose to reduce him to an overly apologetic/regretful man that loves coffee and cooking (and who, quite frankly, talks only about that). Nothing about him having a demon inside of him develops any further than: “Yeah, Spite. He’s there.” Sure, he has some talks with the companions and Rook about it, but again, these conversations/banters are noticeably repetitive, skin deep and not going anywhere in the long run. The funny part is - while every single companion is obviously uncomfortable to be around him because of the demon, Lucanis never has any problems with controlling Spite inside of him, nor we ever see the real consequences of him not sleeping enough to keep Spite contained, for example. (Yes, i am aware Spite tried to run away through the Eluvian - something that you convince him not to do with a simple talk. Boo-hoo, very serious business, right.) How am I supposed to take his problems seriously if I don’t see the significance of them throughout the story’s progression?

Apparently, at the end of his personal quest, having a demon inside of you, feeding off your (in this case) spite, malice - you name it, is just a quirky little inconvenience which gets dealt with through… the power of friendship? The understanding and teamwork between a demon and its host?… What?… How they managed to write a demonic possession this lukewarm is beyond me.

I'm sitting in Starbucks yesterday, applying to some jobs when four ""Dude-Bro-Man-Childs"" walk in. They get their coffee and sit down behind me.

Que Litany of Rogan, Bannon, Trump mouth diarrhea. I ignore it. Gonna have to for the next four years right?

Then they start shitting on Veilguard as they take out their laptops. This gives me an idea. No idea where It came from, but an idea.

I turn around and say, ""Actually. Not a bad game. But I guess if you hate WWE kind of stuff, it makes sense.""

They all stop talking and stare at me. ""What?""

""Well, yeah. I can understand that if you hate WWE the idea of unleashing wrestling moves in fantasy armor while pyrotechnics go off would be something you want to play.""

I start to turn around when I get a ""hold up!""

I explain the Grey Warden speciality to them, then spin up Veilguard on my laptop and proceed to dropkick+firebomb, etc moves.

You should have seen them leaning in.

Then one of them entered their Trump mind again.

""Yeah? What about all the gay relationships?

I shrugged as I switched over to my Mage save for another. ""I don't get into a gay relationship.""

He pushed ""What about the non-binary stuff they shove down your throat?""

""Taash? They're pretty cool, I missed all of it on my first play through, second after that? Eh? It's a quest? I just remember Them being snarky, but hey look at this...""

I chose Taash and let them loose. ""They're basically the angsty baby of Trogdor and the Diablo Barbarian.""

""Now who wants to see the reverse ghost buster that is the mage?""

Shadows flash by--a car, a tree, maybe even a roof--ripped from somewhere I used to recognize. Now they’re just scraps, caught in it's orbit, pulled deeper and deeper into its endless spiral.

When this all started, I didn’t understand. There was a low, angry rumble in the distance, something like thunder, but it never faded. Then came a shift in the air, something I felt in my bones, a strange pressure that made it hard to breathe. The sky turned dark, twisting as if the clouds were folding in on themselves, and within hours, the world outside had vanished into a churning, endless dark.

Time feels hollow now. The hours blur together, and I can’t tell if it’s been days, or weeks. Sometimes I just stare at the walls, remembering ordinary things that now feel like they happened to someone else: the quiet mornings with coffee, the familiar rhythm of footsteps on the sidewalk, the easy conversations with neighbors. 

Once, I thought I’d be brave enough to leave, to try and find something familiar. I opened the door and felt the weight of the wind hit me. Each step forward was like moving through mud, every breath was a struggle against the pressure, and don't get me started on the rain. I stumbled back, gasping, and slammed the door shut. I haven’t tried again since.

It starts to wrap tighter and tighter, forever pressing in. Every part of the house shakes and creaks, like it’s straining to hold together. The noise is loud and endless, rattling through the walls and floors, vibrating through everything I touch. I can barely sleep, and when I do, I dream of people I miss—friends, family, faces I haven’t seen in a while. Sometimes I think I hear their voices in the wind, and I almost go to the door, almost open it, before reality quickly pulls me back.

I try to remember what sunlight felt like, the warmth on my skin, the brightness in the sky, but it’s like reaching for something that was never real in the first place. It has stripped away everything, reducing the world to this endless, spiraling, forever dark.

I open the door, one last time. Outside, there’s nothing but the wind, the sky, and the pull of something far beyond my reach, spinning on and on. Trees. Houses. Lives. All swallowed by a force that feels eternal.

This isn’t just a storm.

It’s something that will never end.

I don't know how this post will be received but here it goes:
I am from the states and my dad was born in Morocco. I've gone there a few times in my life with my dad to see our family and I did love it every time I was there. The food, the beach, the buildings, the coffee shops, that little horse rush line activity? So much to love 💜

(Ive been to Marrakech, Mohammedia Fez and in the mountains by Fez? 😅 sorry I don't remember the name)

With everything going on here since the election; I've considered moving out of the country some place (I don't know how I'd do it, I don't have much money or any skills on paper other than video making and selling items sometimes)
Morocco did cross my mind of course..

I haven't been back since 2016, my Dad and I don't talk now (his choice)..
because I'm a transgender woman, and he doesn't understand/message/call me anymore at all.

I do understand the culture and how that's not really acceptable there, like at all I get it and that's why I'm writing this here I suppose, like a safe little window into Morocco for me to say hello and Essalamo 3alikom.

A thought occurs to me though.. what if I did do it? I could either be a trailblazer or a martyr depending on what would happen. Probably not much in between. I can blend in but I'd always be looking out for others who might not be able to be themselves yet (maybe someone will see this and be inspired? Who knows..)

I don't even know if this post will be allowed here or not.. I dont know how many people would actually silently support me in being who I am while I go about my life if I did live there. Granted I could be stealthy style but I'm not perfect and there may be times where you can tell I'm transgender for whatever reason. I have a new legal name so that's good and I changed my marker from M to F (on my drivers license anyway)

I guess my question is.. 
what do you think?
Could I maybe do it or am i cooked if i go? 
How tough do you think it would be from an inside perspective?
Do people ever really get prosecuted there for similar?

Finally this year the plant flowered and I finally had a chance to experiment with the seeds. I’m not usually much of a baker but lately I’ve had abit of an obsession with Portuguese tarts. 

Wattle or acacia plants were an important resource for indigenous Australians. From the bark to the timber to the seeds these plants served a variety of functions for indigenous people. They also are some of the first plants to return in burnt or cleared areas so play an important role in the rebound of the land in the burning process. Indigenous Australians utilised the seeds to make a kind of flour which was turned into bread. 

This one I’ve been growing is known as acacia longifolia or Sydney golden wattle. After flowering a few months ago it developed seed pods and they finally dried out and were ready to be harvested. Roasting the seeds in a pan you get this woody, earthy toasted smell, people say like coffee or nuts but it’s not really like either to be honest it’s its own kind of thing.  The seeds also popped, split and jumped around the pan kinda like popcorn without the tripling in size. From here you can do a variety of things some people make a drink by steeping the ground seeds, other people infuse into sweets or pastries like I’ve done.

It’s now been 2.5 months since the final discard, and none of my friends talk to me anymore. I’ve gone completely no contact; she didn’t even come back for her stuff.

I’m attending therapy weekly and taking a very low dosage of Xanax, which has been surprisingly helpful. I recently finished reading Whole Again by Jackson MacKenzie—twice.

Most of my work in therapy has focused on understanding why I stayed in a 7-year relationship despite the intense and unbearable abuse. Deep down, it all stems from childhood wounds: very early on, I must have learned that being alone was the worst possible scenario, and that enduring abuse to be loved was a necessary survival skill—perhaps because of my abusive parents.

After all the emotional wreckage from being discarded—the crying, gasping for air, panic attacks, deep depression, anger, and sense of betrayal—I’m now in a far better place.

I’ve come to terms with the fact that I stayed purely out of fear of being alone forever. I value myself so little that I felt I didn’t have a choice: I thought no one would ever be “stupid” enough to love someone as “pathetic,” “ugly,” and “unremarkable” as me. So I stayed, offering endless forgiveness, having no limits. My love was so unconditional, it ended up destroying me.

I now know I could be alone for a while. I know I might never get to be a dad. And that’s okay. I’m the one person I’ll spend my entire life with, so I have to take care of myself, heal properly, move on, and make sure I never suffer like this again. I need to provide for myself, protect myself, and love myself.

I still cry—a lot. What I’m grieving is the life I so desperately wanted, not her. The passive suicidal ideation seems to be temporarily gone. Coffee tastes the same, skies are blue, sunsets are still beautiful. I’m still the creative, sweet, funny, romantic little soul she once fell in love with.

1gme1a1,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1gme1a1/i_havent_finished_a_book_since_my_grandmother/,I haven't finished a book since my grandmother died 2 years ago.,"My grandmother died of COVID complications. She was 74, a lifelong smoker with COPD among other conditions related to her smoking. I spent a lot of time with her growing up. I lived with her for a period of time as a child when my parents were occupied with my sister's severe childhood illness. She encouraged my passion for reading. I was living with her again at the time of her passing. I was working in customer facing retail and brought COVID home from work with me. She had her vaccines. I had my vaccines. Everyone says they don't blame me and I'm trying to not blame myself as well.

She was a widower and had two children, my dad and my aunt. The estate proceedings were traumatic for all involved and I'll try to spare the dirty details. I don't know all the details anyways. The important context is that the basic extent of her last wishes were that the money was to be divided evenly between my aunt and my father, they would have to decide on the rest of her assets but in the case of disagreement, they were to sell it and split it evenly. My aunt was concerned with the house and the cars and wanted the rest donated.

She had a massive library of books. She had an even greater collection but it was lost to a house fire in the 90's. After the fire, they'd pick up the books and all of the pages would fall out of the binding. My grandfather kept buying books for her until she could bear to crack one open again.

She had hundreds of the reader's digest condensed books. She had the Franklin Library's 100 greatest books collection and the 100 greatest masterpieces of American literature. Scores of mystery novels. Some antique books.

I came home from work one day to find my aunt and my father at the tail end of going through the books. My father kept the antique books and a few coffee table books. The rest were boxed up and being loaded into my uncle's pickup truck to be donated.

They were surprised that I was upset to see the books go. I said I wanted to look at them and I wanted the Franklin Library books. They said I could go through them but they don't know what box they're in and I would have to unload the truck myself. I was tired. It was a long, grueling shift at a franchise thrift store. It's hard work. I hurt. It was already starting to rain. This was after things started breaking bad between my aunt and my father. I felt like my aunt was angry with me and my dad was exasperated. I told them to go, but consider taking them to Half Price Books instead. My uncle said it's not worth the $20 they'd get for them.

I looked up some of the prices a few months later. He probably had 10 grand in resale value in the back of his truck (if they weren't in cigarette smoke damaged condition). Obviously they wouldn't get that much from HPB. I know that.

I tried to rationalize it with myself. Everything she owned smelled like it came from a lifetime smoker's house because it did. I told myself they probably would smell horribly of smoke. They'd make my hands stink to even pick them up. I'm going to have to live with my parents after this and it would be selfish of me to make them deal with all of these books.

I haven't been able to get past the start of a book since she passed. I think about the books debacle. I feel guilty and selfish for considering the monetary value of her collection. That's not even why I wanted them. I pick up Pride and Prejudice and all I can think about is her beautiful copy. I feel angry for her children not valuing her passion and her belongings like they should have. I feel angry that she didn't will them to me, the only reader in the family. I'm angry for feeling entitled to her books when I'm the one who brought home an illness that was always going to be lethal for her. I'm angry that she never quit smoking and I'm angry that she signed herself out of the hospital against medical advice. I'm angry she spent her last year oxygen starved and a little foggy. She was sharp as a whip when I was younger. I miss her. I'm building my own collection and I want to read again but I don't know how to hold all of these emotions in my body and they come up to the surface when I try to read.

I just got this kitty from our local shelter on Monday, it is now Thursday 
She's using the litter box just fine and drinking water.
She sleeps in our bed with us and when we're not at home she hides under a coffee table

I've noticed she won't eat her food anymore, she ate the first day and a little bit yesterday and the day before but I haven't seen her eat very much. And she hasn't really eaten today either.
I have Purina cat chow gentle for her as well as some canned food 
I've tried softening the kibble and mixing it with the wet food.
She won't eat any of these.
She nibbled a little of the wet kibble when my boyfriend was holding it for her but that was all she ate.
I'm aware she may have some dental issues but the shelter wasn't clear on what that may be. 
Is this just stress from being in a new environment? As far as Im aware she only had one other owner and she's 5 years old.

**Audio Recording Transcript**

**Date:** \[Redacted\]

**Researcher’s Name:** Dr. Eva Frazier

**Location:** Research Site BU-9



\---



*07:17:04*

*\[Shuffling sounds. A low hum, likely equipment.\]*



**Dr. Frazier:**

It’s… Day 6, 07:17. I woke up to a strange hum just outside the truck. I think I’m the only one who heard it—everyone else is still asleep. How they can sleep after what happened to Ramon, I have no idea. I checked the exterior cameras, and like I thought, there was nothing. I could’ve sworn I saw boots at the edge of the light, but when I pointed the spotlight there—nothing.  

I need to talk to Henry about starting the antipsychotics again. I know he said we should wait, our supply’s running low, but… I’m seeing things. 



*07:18:46*  

*\[Pause. Ceramic clinks against metal. Soft sipping sound as she drinks. A long exhale follows.\]*



**Dr. Frazier:**

At least we still have coffee. That’s something.  

End tape.



*\[End Recording\]*



\---



*12:58:25*

*\[Shuffling. Low hum.\]*



**Dr. Frazier:**  

I know what I saw, Henry. It was him. I'm telling you.



**Dr. Carter:**

It was probably just a mannequin in a similar outfit. Or you’re imagining things. If it was really him, why would Ramon run?



**Dr. Frazier:**  

I don’t know! But it was him. Ask Lucia, she saw him too!



**Dr. Carter:**

She said she didn’t know what she saw.



*12:59:53* 

*\[Exasperated groan. Heavy breathing.\]*



**Dr. Carter:**

I know you’re worried about him. We all are. But you can’t just run off like that. We almost lost you too.  

*\[Pause.\]*  

I’m starting the antipsychotics. We’re taking them, all of us. Okay?



**Dr. Frazier:**

...Okay.



*13:01:05*

*\[Shuffling. Footsteps moving away from the mic.\]*



**Dr. Frazier:**

Hm? I must’ve bumped the record button.



*\[End Recording\]*



\---



*21:32:19*

*\[Shuffling. Low background chatter.\]*



*Dr. Frazier:*

Day 6, 21:32. Sophie’s gone.  

We don’t know when. At some point during her watch, she must’ve stepped out. The truck door was cracked open, and she was nowhere to be found. No note. Just... gone.  

*\[Deep sigh.\]*  

Maya found out first—woke the rest of us. She heard footsteps around the truck and got up to check. We reviewed the tapes. About half an hour after we all went to bed, Sophie spotted something outside. She might’ve said something, but the mic’s still busted. She grabbed her coat and ran out. The camera caught her disappearing into the darkness.



**\[Audio Fragment Corrupted: Intermittent static and distortions. Indecipherable noise.\]**

**\[Noise continues for several seconds before abruptly cutting off.\]**  



**Dr. Frazier:**

She’s with Ramon now, wherever that is. I *know* it.



*\[End Recording\]*



\---



*22:40:03*

*\[Shuffling. A loud humming, like an engine rumbling.\]*



**Dr. Frazier:**

We’re done. Scrapping the mission. First Ramon, now Sophie? I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to stick around to see who vanishes next. The crew agrees—we’re leaving. Now.  

We’ll just sit inside the elevator and wait for it to bring us out. I don’t care what \[REDACTED\] says. None of this is worth it. It never was.  



*\[Pause. Yawn.\]*



**Dr. Frazier:**

Somehow, even after everything I’ve seen today, I’m still tired. Must be a side effect of what Henry gave us. He did mention feeling exhausted or something like that.  

*\[Pause.\]*  

Tomorrow we should reach the elevator. After that, it’s just waiting.  

End recording.



*\[End Recording\]*

**\[Audio Fragment Corrupted: Complete silence for several seconds. The sound is faint but something unnatural is in the static.\]**

**\[Fragment ends abruptly.\]**

That’s all I could recover for now. As far as I know, and from what I pieced together, these logs document the first expedition into the bunker—specifically, Entrance 9, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, I think. The logs date back to the 1980s and were found about a decade ago by another team on their own expedition. The recordings were made on an old cassette tape machine, but most of the tapes were damaged beyond recognition over the years. This is all I’ve managed to salvage so far.

I’ll see if I can dig up more, but no promises.

1gmdq5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/KenduInu_Ecosystem/comments/1gmdq5k/why_kendu_will_be_the_biggest_memecoin_community/,Why $Kendu will be the biggest memecoin - COMMUNITY,"
A real community never fades. These are the people who believe in the project, are loyal, dedicated, work hard to make it a success & never abandon the project. The community fuels organic growth, spread the word both in & outside DeFi. They have a sense of purpose & belonging that turns a simple coin into a full blown movement! A strong community eventually evolves into a “cult” following when members develop a deep commitment to the memecoin’s vision, making it a part of their identity. This “cult-like” loyalty drives them to passionately promote, defend, & grow the project. This level of dedication creates unstoppable momentum that propel the memecoin to success.

Why $Kendu is the best COMMUNITY?

1. Majority members who joined the community, never left. Their belief, loyalty & dedication towards $kendu is unbelievable. Most of the early members are still there. The conviction is unreal. Over 11 members have $Kendu tattoos already.

2. $Kendu community survived the test of time. Over the last 8 months, it steadily grew to ~15k on-chain holders plus ~18-20 Cex holders while having 2 ~90% retracements.

3. $Kendu community believe in the ethos of working hard for their bag & not relying on outside force to drive its success. The $Kendu mantra of “we dont gamble, we work” has been deep instilled in the community. Hence you will see $Kendu army working harder than any other community.

4. $Kendu community is filled with members who came from IRL shilling. These are family, friends, neighbours, colleagues, etc whose first crypto investment is $Kendu & they believe in the $Kendu dream & hardworking community members who shilled them. They know they will never turn on them & trust their work and determination. They are DIAMOND holders, who are not trading shitcoins.

5. Unique $Kendu IRL business. The community members are taking the $Kendu brand no other crypto ever has, directly to Web2 & retail. $Kendu Energy Drinks, $Kendu Nights, $Kendu Coffee, $Kendu Supplements, $Kendu Kush, $Kendu Jewellery, $Kendu Merch, etc are business formed by community members to spread the $Kendu brand in real world. You need to understand they are putting their own self, name, reputation, money, time on line to promote $Kendu brand. These business are not being started for a cycle, but for eternity. The $Kendu brand will survive beyond a typical cycle. This has NEVER been done before. 

6. $Kendu community earns the recognition by working hard & not paying for it. They community works relentlessly on social platforms like X, Reditt, & Telegram, to gather attention and recognition. We don’t pay kol/influencers, but work our way through it. Any kol/influencers that you see supporting $kendu has been earned via our sheer hardwork!

7. $Kendu community is led by the greatest leader the memecoin landscape has ever seen. In a short span of time, @KenduMiazaki has not just built this huge community, but instilled the $Kendu vibe amongst its members. He works harder than all of us & continues to inspire us. He supports us in any initiative we take, shares his wisdom, guides us, & makes us grow. He wants the $kendu community members to become the leader in DeFi space. He believes that we, the community members are the catalyst that will take $Kendu to success. We are like his kids & he is like our dad. We all respect him, & he never disappoints that respect and trust! Also, he is savage & no one, i repeat no one can match his swag! Also, it helps that he is experienced & very very very well connected. 

$Kendu is the best community. We invite you to come and become a part of this growing community & become one of us, become a part of this cult & provide a safe heaven for people in DeFi, to feel safe about their investment, to work for their investment, to be a part of this GIANT EMPIRE @KenduInu ECOSYSTEM.

1gmdpwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1gmdpwj/gave_a_girl_my_number_after_she_expressed_interest/,Gave a girl my number after she expressed interest ,"Hello 👋 

I sometimes go to this local cafe to get my caffeine fix in the mornings. Have been going there for a couple of months now every other week or so. The setup in the restaurant/cafe is as you enter you’re greeted by a sign that says ‘please wait to be seated’. Now as I am just after my coffee (takeout) I usually go straight up to the bar at the back to order. 

Last week, it was slightly busy and as I was approaching a waiter came up to ask me if I’d like to be seated, and I said no I’m just after my coffee and waved at the cute girl that usually serves at the coffee bar (basically showing the waiter that I’m a regular). Now this girl waved back frantically with a massive smile. I’ve never really had any conversation with her apart from, ‘how would you like your coffee, or would you like a biscuit with that’? She smiled and said your regular? She seemed a bit flustered whilst taking the payment and handing me over the coffee. As I exited, I noticed she had hand written a really nice message on the cup, ‘wishing me a lovely day’. 

Now, this girl is really cute and there’s definitely physical attraction. Long story short, I work in a different city so was away for a few days, but I did think about how I could maybe get her number without making it awkward for her in front or her colleagues or her manager (depending on who is there). Anyway, I went in after about a week in between remote work meetings at lunch, and quite hurriedly wrote a message thanking her for her gesture and that I’d like to return the favour,  with my number on a piece of paper.  

It was quite crowded as I entered and she was busy working with the machines so didn’t immediately notice me. As I approached the bar, she turned around and smiled, somewhat flustered and said coffee? She then began to engage in conversation asking me how I’d been, how’s my day going etc? I responded in turn, saying I work in a different city to which she said ‘oh nice, I’ve never been there.. I’ve heard it’s nice etc’ - this was the first time we’ve really had a conversation of sorts, and she really seemed to be engaging with me, initiating the conversation. 

As I paid, I took out the note from my pocket and said, ‘this is for you’ which surprised her slightly as you can expect. Usually,  I’m always on the go, on phone calls whilst waiting for my coffee, and it really was her that made the effort to get my attention. Now, this all happened on Wednesday (day before yesterday) and I still haven’t received a text from her. I feel like I may have went about this the wrong way as it’s once again making her reach out first, rather than me ask for her number direct. Without blowing my own trumpet, I do attract quite a bit of female attention, I dress well, well-mannered, and generally very particular on my appearance, but at times I’m a bit reserved (traditional upbringing), which I think she noticed hence she gave me the nudge. This girl did have to put in most of the effort, and it was she that initiated this whole thing to get my attention, and I’m thinking I maybe didn’t respond in the best way? She is really cute as I said and I’d love to take her out but I’m wondering whether she’ll message me now or that she may message over the weekend/early next week so to avoid showing that she’s too keen (bearing in mind I came in a week after she left that note on the cup). 

Appreciate any advice from you guys. ",0,1731053563.0,dating_advice,5,0.5,False
