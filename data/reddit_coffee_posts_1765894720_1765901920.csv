I have applied to many coffee shops in Calgary, but despite my applications and some experience I gained through a short class on brewing the perfect cup of coffee and maintaining machine hygiene, I have been repeatedly rejected. I don’t understand why, as I was told that approaching a company with relevant skills or experience is a positive sign.

I am eager to expand my skill set and grow with a team that gives me the opportunity to learn. I understand that many applicants send resumes and cover letters, and that some candidates may have more experience than I do. However, how am I supposed to start my career if I am continuously rejected? Everyone has to start somewhere, and I am a motivated individual ready to gain experience and contribute to a team willing to invest in me.

You want a team member who approaches your company with excitement, comes to work every day, brews the perfect cup of coffee for your customers, and helps create a relaxing experience for them.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Trabzonspor vs. Gençlerbirliği: A Tale of Fresh Legs and AFCON Exiles**

Ladies and gentlemen, buckle up for a Süper Lig clash that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “here’s some players, good luck.” Trabzonspor, Turkey’s answer to a luxury yacht (sleek, expensive, and occasionally prone to leaks), hosts Gençlerbirliği, the underdog with the charming moniker “Youth Union” but the on-field energy of a group of teenagers awkwardly navigating a school dance. Let’s break this down with the precision of a Turkish timekeeper and the humor of a stadium announcer who’s had one coffee too many.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (But They Might Yawn)

The odds tell a story of Trabzonspor as a slight favorite, with decimal lines hovering around **1.91–1.95** (implying a **52–53% implied probability** of victory). Gençlerbirliği sits at **3.6–3.65** (roughly **27–28%**), while the draw hovers near **3.5** (about **29%**). These numbers suggest Trabzonspor’s edge, but not a landslide—think of it as a seesaw where Gençlerbirliği’s end is held down by a stack of textbooks labeled “Hope.”

The over/under is set at **2.5 goals**, with slightly lower odds on the over (**1.82–1.88**) than the under (**1.79–1.95**). Given Trabzonspor’s recent 3-3 draw with Beşiktaş and Gençlerbirliği’s 0-0 draw with Kasımpaşa, expect a game where both teams take turns being “meh.”

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Rotations, and AFCON Absences

Trabzonspor’s head coach, Fatih Tekke, is playing chess with his squad. Key strikers **Onuachu** and **Oulai** are AWOL, off to the Africa Cup of Nations, leaving a hole in the attack bigger than a Turkish simit. But fear not! Tekke’s rotation policy means players like **Arsény Batagov** and **Daniil Sikan** (yes, the same Sikan who once scored a goal with his elbow during a power outage) get a shot. Think of it as a “try-before-you-buy” sale at the Trabzonspor talent shop.

Gençlerbirliği? They’re the team that

1po5vrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1po5vrh/advice_needed_multiple_cancellations_and_text/,Advice needed: multiple cancellations and text drying up…end it?,"I’m looking for some advice on whether or not I should continue a relationship I’m in. I’ll share the backstory and where we are now. It’s just confusing to me because her actions and words aren’t matching up, but when we discuss things, she is crazy apologetic and states she wants to stay together. . For reference I’m 45M and she’s 45F.

We started dating at the beginning of November and it started off well. We had coffee, then had a couple of mid-week dinner dates and over the next few weeks really spent a lot of time together (2-3 dates per week). It came up that I had a work trip to LA near the end of November and she joked that she could join me and we could hang out at night. We talked about how it could actually be fun, though a crazy idea. I slept on it and thought “why not? It’ll either be fun or a great story.” I did make it clear that I wouldn’t do the trip or sleep together unless I knew we were exclusive. She agreed that we would be exclusive. 

We spent those few days in Los Angeles and got closer. It was honestly a really great time. However, during the trip she was showing me something on her phone when a guy texted her and she swiped it away. I told her “make sure you get back to John (or whatever his name was),” and she explained it was a guy she was dating before me and he was wishing her a happy birthday. To be fair, it was her birthday. She said he did also say “you replaced me already” and then told me she gets messages from past boyfriends often. I asked why she kept their contact info in her phone if they were broken up and she had no explanation. She also got a lot of WhatsApp messages while we were there, which is strange to me as an American; we don’t really use WhatsApp. That was explained that the doctor she works for (she’s a nurse practitioner) uses it. However she had also told me this guy is super old and ready to retire. Seems weird he’d be a WhatsApp user as a very old guy. She explained that lots of medial people use WhatsApp for communication because it’s encrypted across different devices types. Ok. Seems plausible. But still a few weird things that made me pay closer attention. 

These past two weeks she’s been distant and has cancelled plans four times. One was just a cancellation, no explanation. That’s fine; it happens. The second was a phone call that she asked us to have in the evening after the first cancellation so we could stay connected. We agreed on 8pm. When I tried to contact her that evening she didn’t answer and I didn’t hear from her until the next morning. This is extra strange because she works overnights a few days a week answering medical-type calls from a bunch of nursing homes, and even did that overnight job while we were in LA. Surely she was awake. She said she took the evening off from that job to sleep, which, again, she didn’t even do when we took a trip together. The third time she asked me to meet for a drink because she missed me and wanted to see me. This was spontaneous, and brought up like an hour before she wanted to meet up. I was helping my son look for something he lost and asked if she could pick a place for us so I’d be ready to go when finished. A half hour later I was putting my shoes on and asked her where she picked. Her response was, “I’m just going to order food and stay in. You’ve got a lot going on tonight.” We had a discussion the next day about cancellations and how it appears to me as disinterest. And also that she could’ve asked me if I wanted to cancel, not just made up my mind for me. She apologized and told me she’s not used to an emotionally mature man who communicates and expects communication back, and she should’ve explained better why she cancelled. 

The last straw (maybe): I had tickets to a play and she agreed to go. This is an obligation for work on my end because it’s a theater project that helps kids who live in rough neighborhoods, and I make funding decisions on projects like this. About a week prior to the play I reminded her and her response was one of surprise. She didn’t think we had firmed up those plans, but she was happy to go. The night before I sent her the name of the wine bar where I made reservations prior to the play. She gave a short answer thanking me for making plans, and added that she was going to bed early because she felt a cold coming. The day of, she cancelled, but really wouldn’t come out and say she was cancelling. She also said “I don’t want you breaking up with me” since we had discussed how her cancellations felt like lack of interest. She kind of positioned it as ”just take your son instead” but wanted me to make the decision, likely because we had just discussed cancellations. I didn’t hear from her all night and assumed she was sleeping. The next day maybe three texts the entire day, all very short. I feel like she had made other plans and then lied about it the day of. That was this past Saturday. 

Since then it’s been dry. Usually we will communicate throughout the day and in the morning. Today I didn’t send any kind of a good morning text and still haven’t heard from her. Yesterday we exchanged a few messages but they were all about how cold it is out. 

I feel like I was patient with the cancellations, and even had a clear discussion with her about my expectations in regards to this. I also still think abut the sketchy text and WhatsApp messages, and feel like she’s not being super honest with me. Just curious how people with an outside perspective see this. I’m not crazy invested in this, but I don’t want to eliminate someone who is a good partner on paper if I’m just misreading things.",1,1765901426.0,datingoverforty,1,1.0,False

For the first time since a child, I started to treat my ADHD with medication. I am a stay at home mom right now and my thinking has been so disorganized, forgetting things and not able to manage my daily tasks. So far,  my mind feels more quiet and I can focus easily but I do find I feel kind of dopey/ slight brain fog. This is my first dose and I was not expecting to feel this as it wasn't discussed with my physician. We just talked about common side effects but that's all.  I woke up a little tired and had an extra cup of coffee, maybe that's why ?

Tooth likely infected, top right wisdom tooth, quite painful but not so bad I'm comfortable blaming it for the sudden vomiting

Last night around 2am, I woke up after having passed out (highly, highly unusual. sleep usually doesnt come to me til around 6am) at an unknown time. Felt a little nauseous, it built up over about an hour til I got sick. Felt perfectly fine after, blamed the tinned chicken soup i'd eaten the previous evening, tried to have some cannabis to go to sleep fully but it immediately brought the nausea back and I vomited again. I then passed out again until 4:30am, woke back up still a little sick feeling, and then properly went to sleep a few minutes later.

I cannot stress enough how odd this is. The only thing different to usual was the two codeine/paracetamol tablets I'd taken, and my toothache. I take codeine containing painkillers semi regularly (as in for a couple days every few months) for various things and have never once experienced anything as far as even signs of fatigue after taking it. This includes at night if I then consume cannabis ontop of it, though I make a point of not taking more painkillers once I'm in bed-time mode (i.e. under the influence of thc).

Although cannabis helps me sleep, mostly by preventing nightmares, it absolutely does not knock me out like that. The two in combination never have either, nevermind making me get sick, so I worry it may be entirely unrelated.

Over the course of my whole non-toddler life, I've never gotten sick so suddenly like that and been this fine afterwards. Stomach is a little tender today. Coffee stayed down fine, no nausea, so I reckon it's gone. Do I even need to worry?

How do I move forward?","I’m looking for outside perspective because this situation has gone on for so long that I genuinely don’t know how best to handle it anymore.

In July 2024, I (27/F) met my now-partner of a year, Anthony (27/M), through Sam (27/M), my sister Jemima’s (25/F) fiance and Anthony’s best friend. We all went out together regularly as a group. From the first day Anthony and I met, there was a strong connection between us (the kind you only read about in books or see in films) but nothing happened initially. Sam would constantly joke *separately* to both of us about us being into each other, and we always dismissed it.

In November 2024, a group of us (me, Jemima, Sam, Anthony, and my close friend Bella (26/F) and Sam's close friend, Nathan (28/M)) went on a three-week trip to Australia. From the start of the trip, Anthony and I were very close. About a week in, after everyone else had gone to sleep one night, Anthony admitted he had feelings for me and said he’d felt them since we first met back in July. I felt the same. We agreed not to act on anything until we were back home in New York and could handle it properly, including telling Jemima and Sam.

About a week later, after a heavy night of drinking at a party (Jemima and Sam stayed home), Anthony and I kissed. Bella and Nathan saw it and encouraged us to be honest with Jemima and Sam, they were happy for us and said they’d always thought we’d make a great couple.

The next day, I told my sister Jemima, who was genuinely happy for us. She then told Sam. Initially, Sam said he was happy too.

The very next day, Sam completely changed. He began ignoring both of us and refused to speak privately when Anthony asked to clear the air. The final week of the trip was extremely tense. On the last day of the trip, Nathan (Sam’s friend) was present to help mediate a conversation between Sam and Anthony. During that conversation, things got pretty heate and Sam said he was furious, that Anthony had broken “bro code,” and that he would never be friends with him again.

Since returning home to New York in December 2024, Sam has:

* Refused to speak to Anthony
* Removed him from all social media
* Ignored multiple attempts by Anthony to meet and talk

In May 2025, I sent Sam a long, thoughtful message apologising for the hurt caused, explaining that nothing was planned or intended to be deceptive, and asking to meet in person to clear the air. He agreed, cancelled on the day, rescheduled, and then ignored me entirely. That was honestly devastating.

The situation has since affected my entire family:

* My mum noticed distance between me and Jemima (we were always very close)
* She organised a coffee with me, Jemima, and Sam to clear the air, it turned into shouting and resolved nothing
* Sam believes my family hates him and now avoids coming to our house
* Birthdays have been ignored on both sides
* At a family wedding abroad, Sam continued to blank Anthony despite Anthony trying to be civil

Most recently, Sam believes I blocked him (I didn’t, I just unsaved his number, which affects WhatsApp visibility), and he told Jemima that I’d blocked him.

At this point, I’m not looking to judge who’s right or wrong, or to force reconciliation. I’m not expecting Sam and Anthony to be best friends again. I’m just trying to figure out how to handle this going forward in a way that protects my relationship, my mental health, and most importantly, my relationship with my sister.

Specifically, I’d really appreciate advice on:

* How to approach future family events when Sam refuses to engage or acknowledge us
* Whether it’s healthier to stop trying to resolve this and focus on firm boundaries instead
* How to accept that Sam may never change, without letting it permanently damage sibling and family relationships

Anthony and I are very serious (we’ve spoken about marriage and children), so this isn’t a temporary situation. Any practical advice on how to move forward would really help.

**TL;DR:** I (27F) started dating my sister’s fiancé’s best friend (27M) after mutual feelings developed. My sister (25F) was supportive, but her fiance (27M) initially said he was happy and then cut us off completely, citing “bro code.” A year later, despite apologies, mediation, and multiple attempts to talk, he still refuses to acknowledge our relationship, and it’s now affecting my family. I’m looking for advice on how to move forward and set boundaries, not on who’s right or wrong.",0,1765900943.0,relationship_advice,4,0.5,False

For a while I struggled with my medication compliance and let this junk accumulate for God knows how long, to the point where I just didn't use my table or look at this part of the room.

1. Put everything into cardboard boxes

2. Vacuum the floor

3. Replace my old broken wobbly table legs with new solid metal hairpin legs that screw directly into the table (original ones were attached with brittle plastic brackets that broke over time)

4. Swept off the table and wiped it down with cleaning solution. Had a lot of old coffee stains and dust from old projects.

5. Sorted through one box at a time. I had a trash can next to me and threw away any garbage that got mixed in. I made piles of stuff based on category (soldering stuff, electronics components, art stuff, mail, cables, pens and pencils, etc) and went from there.

I have been recently diagnosed with Combined ADHD..

Since moving in with my partner, i do not struggle to clean or keep the house tidy. I find cleaning in my own home therapeutic.. 

(I was a super messy person when i lived with my Mum. Loads of cups left in my room, forgetting things, late for appointments, ADHD paralysis etc)

Soon as i wake up on the weekends, i sip my coffee and off i go!   
Don't get me wrong.. It takes me all day to complete it all because i divver off to do other tasks in the house.. but i now oddly find cleaning therapeutic for my ADHD??

My new job is suuuuuper dead. I mean DEAD. No customers... No nothing.. I have nothing to focus on.. nothing.. So me popping this pill at 6am before i work at 8am.. to hyper focus on what? The wall?

I cope well with 1 coffee in the Morning (I reduced my coffee intake so much throughout the years) and off i go! I personally feel i don't need the meds..

I don't feel my psychiatrist listened to me when i was telling him this... as he first said ""Take them when you need them"" then he changed his mind and said ""Take them daily"" to help with my hyperactivity brain...

The way i see it,  
When i drink coffee my brain hyper focuses.. then once it wears off, i become groggy and sleepy.. and want to eat.. then i sleep fine...

So, why do i want to take a pill that does the same thing, but maybe make my BPD and PMDD worse once the high drops??

When i abused class A's and coffee, i had the best shut off brain.. i'd focus on conversations around me.. but Christ the comedown was awful...  
I wouldn't eat, insomnia was awful, my depression got worse and my anxiety was heighted.. Until i got my fix again..

Thats what the meds will do..  I'll get ratty, not eat, lower moods.. until i get my medication fix again (or topper).

I just want to keep trying other things to help naturally with my ADHD brain.. ADHD is still going to be there, no matter how much i put a pill in my body daily.. So instead of blocking it, i want to face it and help it and better it..

Since the Pickleball place opened up next door I literally can't find a parking spot anymore, that place is crazy. Along with that tons of random people I know started playing pickleball and trying to get others into it. This got me thinking Peter Lynch style about if there was any way for me to get Pickleball exposure and I think I found a good one.

LTH Life Time Group Holdings. They operate suburban lifestyle/fitness supercenters. They try to be a 3rd place people go on top of home and work where you can work out, eat, socialize, get coffee, go to the spa, play sports, send some emails, meet up with friends. They charge a membership fee then upsell people on things while they spend time there like training or healthy snacks or whatever. Most of their costs are fixed which means one a location hits breakeven any revenue growth is almost pure profit. This is how they had 73% earnings growth last year with 23% revenue growth.

In 2021 they jumped on the pickleball bandwagon re-allocating space to put pickleball courts in their centers. This brought in a ton of new business, brought in a younger crowd, and lead to people spending more time and money there.

Their moat is in theory people start spending time and building connections. Also cancelling the membership would require then going out and subscribing to multiple smaller memberships. Since it isn't a need it would be something to get cut earlier on people's budgets in a recession but their average client is well off enough they probably won't be needing to make those calls.

They are also switching to a more asset-lite model, changing from owning the buildings to leasing them, this will likely change their balance sheet as they get rid of assets and pay off the associated loans. We will talk about the debt later but it seems fine in my opinion.

So what are the numbers? What do we get for our money. 73% historical earnings growth, 23% revenue growth. The forecast is 14% earnings growth 10% revenue growth (they have a good record of beating forcasts). 20 P/E, 17.5 foreward P/E. P/S of 2, P/B of 1.9, PEG of 1.4x. Their FCF is down this quarter so only P/FCF of 81 or so, but it just looks like a weird year for cashflow. 

They have a debt to equity of 50% and pay 20% of their EBIT to debt. $1.5B total debt. Things seem to be moving in the right direction and they are fully capable of outgrowing that interest payment. https://i.imgur.com/MEnv2sd.jpeg 

The only other not amazing stats are return on equity/return capital employed but the switch to leasing would likely change those numbers too.

well i know she didn't mean to hurt me, all she wants is me to feel good about myself and not regret my choices in future but the way she do all this just hurts me a lot

Like genuinely checking analytics every hour consumed. I'm talking 12 hour days analyzing what goes viral, testing different hooks, rewriting scripts, trying new editing approaches, the whole thing.

Why the obsession? Because I truly think video is where all the leverage is now. Growing audiences, building opportunities, creating income, getting noticed, everything hinges on whether you can capture attention for under a minute.

But here's what nearly destroyed me: despite posting every single day, nothing was connecting. I'd spend 6 hours on a video just to watch it die at 340 views. Tested every tactic from every content coach. Bought courses. Followed ""proven frameworks."" Still stuck.

I was genuinely starting to believe some people just have it and I don't. Like maybe I was just missing whatever makes content click.

Then I had this realization where it hit me, I'm grinding nonstop, but I'm doing it blind. I don't actually know what's wrong. I'm just throwing things out and praying.

So I stopped chasing some mythical algorithm and started tracking real data. Analyzed my last 50 videos frame by frame, documented every single drop off point, and found 5 patterns that kept destroying my retention:

**Vague hooks get scrolled immediately.** ""Wait for it..."" gets skipped every time. But ""Used my left hand for everything for a week and spilled coffee 11 times"" stops the scroll. Specificity beats mystery.

**Second 5 decides if they stay.** Most people bail between 4-7 seconds if you haven't proven it's worth watching. I was building suspense like an idiot. Now I hit them with my best visual or payoff right at second 5. That's your real hook.

**Silence longer than 1 second destroys everything.** Seriously tracked this, anything longer than 1.2 seconds and people think the video froze. What feels like good pacing to you reads as ""boring"" to someone scrolling. Cut way tighter than feels natural.

**Static visuals lose viewers within seconds.** If your video looks the same for more than 3 seconds, people zone out. I started switching camera angles, adding b roll, changing text placement, anything to create visual variety. Went from losing 54% at the midpoint to keeping 70%.

**Rewatch rate matters way more than people realize.** Videos people watch twice get pushed way harder. Started adding quick text that's easy to miss, faster cuts, little details you catch on second viewing. Rewatch rate went from 13% to 37% and views exploded.

Honestly the biggest shift was stopping the guessing game and actually measuring what was happening second by second.

I found this tool called TikAlyzer that analyzes your videos and tells you exactly where people drop off and why. Like it doesn't just show the dropoff point, it explains the actual reason people left and how to fix it next video. That's when things actually changed. Went from 340 average views to 17k in roughly 3 weeks.

Native analytics show you people are leaving. This shows you the exact moment, why it's happening, and what to change next video.

If you're posting consistently but can't break 1k views, it's not your content that sucks, you just don't know what's actually working vs what you think is working.

Putting this out there because figuring this out took way more trial and error than it should have. Wish someone had just explained the actual mechanics when I was stuck. Could've avoided months of frustration and self-doubt. So I'm laying it out for whoever's in that position right now.",1,1765900813.0,TikTokMarketing,0,1.0,False
1po5iiv,https://i.redd.it/24cgmhh29l7g1.jpeg,Hello? (Chapter 2),"Part 3: The Hike to The Cabin.

I set out on my journey to the cabin. The pull along cart they had given me, well. it wasn’t ideal. It had an awkward handle to hold on to, that made a little difficult to pull. but thankfully it had big wheels and handled the weight of a year’s worth of supplies without much issue. The trail was mostly flat and smooth, nothing too challenging yet.

From the station to the cabin, I had about a five hour hike ahead, giving me a chance to preview the area I’d patrol.

A nice introduction.

I passed a few small creeks Rich mentioned, stopping to note landmarks like distinctive rocks and trees, water flow, and small animals drinking. Nothing unusual for the woods.

After two and a half hours, I needed to take a break, the cart was wearing on my legs, a reminder of my last two years glued to a desk. I pulled out a snack from the cart and drank some water from my thermos, enjoying the views while eating a candy bar.

Taking in the sights and sounds of nature, I suddenly noticed something odd. The normal woodland noises, wind rustling leaves, birds chirping, animals scurrying, faded gradually. It took me a minute to notice it all cause it happened so slowly.

No birds, no critters, not even the distant creek.

Just absolute silence. For a good few minutes it lasted.

Then, faintly, something whispered through the air, growing closer until it was right by my ear, a gentle “Hello?”

My heart skipped. I froze, candy bar halfway to my mouth. “I’m hearing things. No way that was real, especially so close,” I thought. But the voice had been clear, soft, almost curious, like it was testing me. I glanced around, I saw nothing, but trees and the trail, no one in sight.

My mind raced. Why would something out here say “Hello”? Was it mimicking the rule everyone kept insisting on? I remembered the girl during my interview, Jonah mentioning it at the gate, Josh’s vague warning, and Rich’s intense stare when he drilled the rule into me.

They all acted like saying “Hello” was life or death, but no one explained why. Was it some local superstition like back home? A park tradition? Or something else entirely, something tied to this unnatural silence?

I swallowed hard, feeling exposed. I hadn’t said “Hello” when I stopped here, and now the woods felt… watchful. “Okay, fine,” I muttered, following their instructions. “Hello? Sorry I didn’t say that earlier. New around here.”

As subtly as the silence had crept in, the sounds returned: wind, water, birds, squirrels. All normal again. I exhaled, tension easing, but questions gnawed at me. What was that voice? Why did saying “Hello” seem to reset the world around me? It wasn’t just politeness, there seems to be weight to it, like a key to something I didn’t understand.

I made a mental note to press Josh or Rich later, though their cagey responses so far didn’t promise answers.

“Okay, I have to remember to say ‘Hello’ anytime I enter a new area,” I told myself. “Apparently, something out here needs to hear it.” But what? And why did it feel like the woods were listening, waiting for me to slip up?

I finished my candy bar, packed my trash, checked my map and compass, and continued for the remaining two and a half hours.

I reached the cabin just before nightfall, with the sun low enough to cast a golden glow on a small, picturesque log cabin, like a postcard. Trees formed a canopy overhead, a clean walkway led to the door, birds and animals bustled, wind and water whispered sweetly. It was perfect.

I pulled the cart to the front door, then I start to search for a lockbox Rich mentioned, around back, hanging under a foundation leg I think he said. I retrieved the key, returned to the front, and as I unlocked the door, it happened again.

The silence crept in, birds stopped, animals hushed. My stomach twisted. Not again. Was this going to happen every time I forgot their damn rule? I thought of that faint “Hello” on the trail, the way it seemed to come from nowhere.

Was something out here enforcing this ritual, waiting for me to acknowledge it? I didn’t know if I was being paranoid or if the woods were playing tricks, but I wasn’t about to test it.

“Hello out there!” I called, louder than necessary, my voice echoing slightly.

The sounds returned, just like before. I stood there, key in hand, staring into the darkening forest.

“Why does this keep happening?” I muttered. “What’s causing it? And why the hell does something out here say ‘Hello’ first?”

I wanted to chalk it up to exhaustion or my imagination, but the voice on the trail felt too real, too deliberate. It wasn’t human, not quite, but it wasn’t an animal either. It felt… expectant. Like it was part of some unspoken pact I’d stumbled into. I shook my head. “Only time will tell, I guess.”

I opened the door, dust billowed in the fading sunlight, visible through the windows. Clearly, no one had been here in a while. I stepped in and said, “Hello, I’m new here! I’ll be staying for a while, hope that’s okay?” My voice sounded small in the cabin, but I wasn’t taking chances after the trail. If saying “Hello” kept the silence at bay, I’d do it, even if I didn’t understand why. Maybe it was just a quirk of the job, but the way Rich’s eyes had bored into me when he said it made me think there was more to it, something he wasn’t telling me.

Nothing responded, so maybe the “Hello” I said outside sufficed. I began unloading the cart, brought everything inside, and got settled in. I checked the computer, tried to figure out the old oven (knobs worn, hard to read temp and timer), I inspected the bathroom (shower with running water, but the toilet was an outhouse-style seat over a deep hole, no strong smell, given the vacancy). After unpacking into drawers and the closet, it was dark out. I radioed Rich and logged today’s findings.

“This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone copy?”

After a moment, Josh replied. “This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance. You make it out there safe? Over.”

“Yup, safe and sound, I just got settled in. Over.”

“Good. Glad you’re safe. What do you think of it, Alex? Over.”

“So far, so good. Gorgeous views, plenty to explore. The Cabin’s a little more Rustic than your dad let on, but it’s home now. I’ll make the best of it. Over.”

“Yeah, they’re run-down, need updates. But it’s shelter. How was the walk? Over.”

Rich said report anything, but not to discuss the “Hello” rule. How do I explain the silence and faint voice? I needed answers. “On my way, I stopped halfway for a break—”

Josh cut in before I could finish, “Did you make sure to, well, you know? Over.""

Knowing he understood, I pushed for clarity. “Not at first. I sat, ate, and everything went dead quiet. Then I swore I heard a faint ‘Hello’ by my ear. I said it back, and things normalized. Same thing happened when I got to the cabin, but I remembered in time. Josh, what’s the deal? Why does something out here say ‘Hello’? What am I dealing with? Over.""

He let out a sigh, his voice sharp with urgency. “Make sure, I mean 100% sure, you say it! Every time you enter your zone. No matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.”

I didn’t fully trust him, not when no one would explain, but what choice did I have? “Okay, I trust you. I’ll keep it up. But besides that, the walk was uneventful. Copy that? Over.”

“copy, 12. Have you filled your report yet? And is everything working? Power, water, fridge, oven? Or anything need repairs? Over.”

“All good. Oven’s a bit tricky, but I’ll manage. My Report will be finished soon and then I'm heading to bed. How Copy, Over.”

“Good copy, and hey Drop the extra radio lingo, no need. But good to hear. Make sure to radio in if you need anything. Oh, also get up sometime tonight for a quick peek outside. Fire crossed our line unexpectedly. Over.”

“Can do. I'll have an alarm set for three hours from now. I’ll radio in if it’s important. Over.”

“Sounds good. I’m signing off. Sleep well, stay safe. Josh out.”

“Night, Josh. Alex out.”

I turned off the radio, grabbed a snack, and  sat down at the computer to log my report, omitting the silence and voice, but including notes and observations. Submitted it to the board's and Rich’s email.

Now With that done, I checked out the games on here. There was three. Tetris, Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold ’em. Better than absolutely nothing, I guess.

I started to play the poker game, turned some music on from my phone. And got lost playing for awhile. Then after some time. Without warning, silence fell. Absolute quiet, no music, no outside sounds, not even my own breath. fear hit, as I did begin to hear... multiple loud knocks at the door… Followed by a deep, gentle… “Hello?”

End of Part 3.

Part 4: The Knocking.

Loud, continuous knocking shook the door, followed by a deep, gentle “Hello?”

“What the fuck?” I thought, heart pounding.

Rich had said no one was allowed in the 20, mile zone. And especially with the fire going on near by. staff only. A lost hiker, maybe? I didn’t know, but the knocking grew louder, harder, insistent.

I stood, glancing at the machete by the desk. Better be safe than sorry. I slowly get up to grab it, then tucking it behind me to avoid scaring a potential hiker, and I then crept to the door. Just in case, I called out, “Hello?”

The knocking stopped. Dead silence.

I gripped the knob, turned it slowly, and pulled the door open. Nothing. Not a soul, not a footprint in the dirt. The woods stared back, still, like they were holding their breath. I grabbed the flashlight from the desk and circled the cabin, staying close to its walls. Crickets chirped, owls hooted in the distance-peaceful, normal. But something felt wrong, like the silence was waiting to return.

“What the actual fuck was that?” I muttered, heading back inside. I locked the door, checked every window, and shut off the lights. It was nearly 1:30 a.m. I’d done my nightly check outside, as Josh had asked, and everything seemed fine except for that knocking.

Exhausted and ready for a new day. I decided to get ready for bed and ignore what happened. I went to the bathroom and brushed my teeth, washed my face, grateful for the heated water when leaving the bathroom, The outhouse hole caught my eye as I passed. It was too deep, too dark, like it led somewhere beyond dirt. I shivered, avoiding it.

I got changed and then climbed into my sleeping bag on the twin bed, old and well worn, its sheets being clean was questionable. The cabin was a bit chilly, so that and maybe not clean sheet, made bringing the sleeping bag a smart choice. I got zipped up inside and got all good and comfortable, and passed out, the woods’ peaceful sounds lulling me to sleep. A good night, despite everything.

I woke around 8:30 a.m. the next morning. Not having slept well from last night. I unzip my sleeping bag, the cold air biting me. Getting out of my sleeping bag took serious effort, who likes waking up freezing?

I started my daily routine, start the coffee, brush my teeth, put on clean clothes, have my coffee, and be ready for my new life ahead.

(Several months later)

Time had flew by out here.

When I arrived, it was chilly, leaves just falling. Now, a blanket of snow draped everything, turning my zone into a breathtaking wonderland. The beauty of the woods never ceased, but I couldn’t shake the memory of that first night’s knocking, or the way the silence felt alive, waiting.

I spent my days patrolling, mapping out landmarks, distinctive rocks, creeks, trees. I noted animal patterns. a massive buck with an impressive rack leading a deer herd, squirrels scurrying, a colorful duck flying overhead with a unique neck band. I snapped a photo of two chipmunks on a snow dusted log, snowflakes falling gently past them.

My reports to Rich and headquarters were detailed, sent via the cabin’s ancient computer. I was getting pretty damn good at Texas Hold ’Em in my downtime, I started one of my puzzles and I'm almost done with one of my books.

though the oven’s worn knobs still baffled me, I set it and wait for it to warm up, and then cook by guesswork and pull it out before it gets to burnt.

No more silences or ghostly visitors since that first night. I said “Hello” every time I stepped outside, entered a new area, or returned to the cabin. It was second nature now, a ritual to keep whatever haunted these woods at bay.

Things felt normal... for a while.

Then one morning, I woke late, around 10 a.m. Something was wrong. Silence. Absolute, suffocating silence. No birds, no wind, nothing.

“Maybe I’m still half asleep,” I told myself, heading to the bathroom. I peed, couldn’t hear it. Brushed my teeth, washed my face, no sound of water, no clink of the sink. It was like the woods had swallowed sound itself, just like that first night.

Had I forgotten to say “Hello” yesterday? I didn’t think so, but I wasn’t taking chances. “Hello!” I called, waiting for the woods’ sounds to return, like before.

Nothing. No gentle “Hello” echoed back, just deafening silence. I couldn’t even hear my own voice.

Panic crept in. I threw on a pair pants, a shirt, and some slippers I brought, stepped outside, and yelled, “Hello!” Still nothing.

“Oh shit, this can’t be good.” I hurried back inside, sat at the computer, and emailed the station: “Rich, Josh, you there? I just woke up and I can’t hear anything. What’s going on?”

Minutes later, Jonah replied.

""Alex, it’s Jonah. Rich and Josh are meeting with the neighboring rangers about downed trees blocking some roads. I’m holding down the station. Have you been saying ‘Hello’?”

“Yes, every damn time I move or breathe! I’ve been religious about it. Are you saying it?” I typed, frustrated.

“Of course,” Jonah wrote. “Four years here, never slipped up once. I can hear fine, the station’s safe. The fence keeps it out. You sure you’ve been saying it?”

“YES, I SWEAR! If we’re all saying it, why’s this happening?”

Jonah took a while to respond.

""It happened once before, a year ago, off-season. A homeless man wandered into the zone. Silence hit, stayed for a week. In the station it was fine, but in the zone, We couldn’t hear a thing, Police came and took him, he couldn’t speak, just stared blankly. We never learned why it lifted, but it didn’t stop until he was gone, maybe he's not even alive.""

My stomach dropped.

""So, someone’s out here, lost, causing this? Was he deaf or mute?”

“Probably, one or the other."" Jonah replied. “Couldn’t talk, wouldn't write, or even sign. Just stared. If someone’s in the zone who can’t say ‘Hello,’ it stirs things up.""

""What happened to him?""

""No idea. One the police took him, we never heard more. But If you can’t hear, that has to mean someone’s out there.”

“Should I head to the station, and we search together?”

“No, I can’t leave. Rich’s orders: someone stays for radio and messages. Start at your cabin, search east toward the station, check in before heading back.”

Great. I had to find a lost person in this silent hell, alone, without hearing. Whatever was out here didn’t just want ‘Hello’ it needed it, and someone’s silence was breaking everything.

""Okay,” I typed. “I’ll pack a few things and start east. What’s the safe code for the gun?”

Jonah hesitated. “Not allowed to give it out, unless it’s an absolute emergency.”

“THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE FUCKING EMERGENCY, JONAH! GIVE ME THE DAMN CODE!”

“2709. there's Shells inside a bag next to the gun. Be safe, bring your radio. If you’re not here by nightfall, I’ll come looking.”

“I’ll do my best,” I replied.

I threw on cold-weather gear, packed food, water, an extra jacket, flashlight, batteries, and radio. I opened the safe, loaded the 12-gauge, slung the ammo bag over my shoulder, grabbed my map, and headed east.

The silence felt heavier, like it was watching. I had 10 miles to cover before dark, hoping to find whoever was causing this and stop it, for their safety and ours.

Five miles in, around 2 p.m., I made good time despite the silence. Dark clouds rolled in, and snow fell hard, blanketing the trail. I neared a pond I’d marked, expecting it frozen, empty of animals.

I was wrong.

The massive buck I’d noted was thrashing in the pond, breaking ice, covered in blood. Around it, the bodies of his herd lay scattered, torn apart. The silence wasn’t just quiet—it was driving the woods to slaughter.

“What the hell is going on?” I thought, standing frozen, watching the buck’s frenzied destruction.

It stopped, than it turned, it locked eyes with me, and charged at me.

Hindi naging madali pagapply niya since wala siyang backer aside from credentials niya. Kasi ang mga relatives namin maliit talaga tingn sa family namin. She was hired after months in private school. Ngayon since may mga anak na ate namin, as “we” their Tita natretreat na namin sila ng mga gusto nila. Years passed by, one of our pamangkin graduated from college this year lang with the support of titas. Widowed na si Ate ko so wala na silang father. Yes my family na rin ako pero I still helped pur pamangkins.

Now here’s the shocking issue, buntis yung pamangkin ko. 7months, tinago niya ng 7 months samin. She stayed in my house for few weeks and I noticed na iba yung taba niya pero I didn’t mind to ask kasi lagi namin silang binibilin about sa bf bf na yan. Today ko lang nalaman sa ate ko na recently lang din niya napaamin, tapos nanlamig talaga ako ng sobra. Honestly, hindi pa agad agad nagprocess sakin kasi working and periodical test ng anak ko. While asa coffee shop ako kanina, working ng konti at naghihintay then nagbreakdown si bakla kasi dun pa lang nagsink in lahat sakin. 😭 Sobrang disappointed ako kasi naispoil sila samin and todo bilin kami pero hindi namin sila hinigpitan ng sobra sobra pero hind rin nagkulang sa bilin. Kasi gusto namin naeenjoy nila yung mga bagay na di namin naenjoy dati habang kami estudyante kasi nga ang hirap ng buhay.

Siya ang eldest ng ate ko and before mamatay bayaw ko bilin niyang makakapagtapos kasi pangarap nila yun. Pero habang binibilang ko yung buwan backward, buntis na siya before pa ang graduation niya.  Nakakasama ng loob sobra. Hindi pa kami mayaman pero hindi na rin kami naghihirap ngayon, their student life is far from our experience na 30pesos lang ang baon sa college. Hindi ko alam kung saan kami nagkulang sa bilin. 😭 Sobrang sakit saming mga Tita. 😭",3,1765900325.0,RantAndVentPH,0,1.0,False

JB Pritzker’s rise to political prominence.  But the story pulls one pressing question into focus as he looks beyond Springfield: Can a Democrat win over the 99 percent as a 1-percenter?,"By [Maeve Reston](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/maeve-reston/)

SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — On a late summer afternoon at the Illinois State Fairgrounds, hundreds of Democrats sipped cold beer from clear plastic “JB” party cups as they waited under a large tent to hear their governor’s fiery populist attacks on President Donald Trump’s agenda.

Cutting a broad figure in a casual short-sleeved button-down, Jay Robert “JB” Pritzker, 60, thundered from the stage about Medicaid, Medicare, voting rights, civil rights and food assistance, accusing Trump and his party of demolishing the social safety net.

“MAGA Republicans are trying to take away everything that matters to working families,” said Pritzker, who is seeking a third term next year. “Are you ready for the fight?”

Left unsaid by Pritzker that day in August: He is the wealthiest officeholder in the United States, other than Trump, as a scion of the Hyatt Hotels family with a personal fortune worth $3.9 billion, according to [Forbes](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.forbes.com/profile/jb-pritzker/). For years, Pritzker has bankrolled an array of liberal causes and his own political career at a nearly unrivaled clip, pouring more than $508 million into state and federal elections since 2015, including at least $348 million for his campaigns.

Pritzker’s personal fortune has given him a ready-made war chest that has powered his ascent as a Democratic donor, candidate and officeholder during the past three decades, a close examination of his career shows. His money opened doors to elite fundraising circles and close relationships with Hillary Clinton and other powerful Democrats; instantly turned on a cash spigot in his first run for governor; endeared him to abortion rights activists as he cut checks for ballot measures in a raft of states; and covered the costs of travel on private jets — all without the time-consuming task of dialing other wealthy patrons to donate to him.

To some, that makes him an avatar of a problematic combination of money and politics. Many other Democrats argue that his wealth has given him the freedom to champion policies that benefit everyday people without the constraints of owing favors to donors. For years, Pritzker has fended off rivals in both parties who’ve portrayed him as a [“trust fund baby”](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://apnews.com/gubernatorial-elections-af2fc502881b42c584ee1f917ec717a1) who has been [“buying off”](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.sj-r.com/story/news/state/2018/03/10/kennedy-accuses-pritzker-buying-off/13224619007/) elected officials by presenting himself as an advocate for the working class.

Now, he is using that strategy to lay a foundation for what could be his most ambitious political endeavor yet: a run for president in 2028.

As he forcefully challenges Trump’s agenda on immigration, redistricting, domestic military deployments and the economy, Pritzker is testing his party’s appetite for a leader from the same “one percent” that many have railed against in recent years.

While Democrats have a history of falling in love with charismatic aristocrats who take up the cause of the poor, including Franklin D. Roosevelt and Robert F. Kennedy, this might be a different moment. Left-wing Democrats have increasingly villainized wealth, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) blaming the “oligarchy” for the country’s ills and arguing billionaires [shouldn’t even exist](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1176485327336329216), a position fellow democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York, [has adopted](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/zohran-mamdani-says-dont-think-billionaires-rcna215821). The party that has spent years accusing Trump and his wealthy allies of self-dealing is searching for ways to reconnect with working-class voters that it has lost to Trump’s “America First” appeals.

“I can’t see how a billionaire would be a good person to represent this entire country,” said Carmen Borgia, 26, a graphic designer who carried a sign that said “No such thing as an ethical billionaire” at an anti-Trump No Kings rally this fall in Washington. She said she could not support a presidential candidate with that much wealth: “They can’t relate to most Americans. It’s just something I am passionate about.”

Other Democrats see Pritzker as the answer to Trump’s brand of populism. “He’s got a really good opportunity to show that not all billionaires are bad,” said Democratic strategist Joe Caiazzo, a former aide for both of Sanders’s presidential campaigns.

Pritzker has for years sought to deflect concerns about his wealth, using a repertoire of self-deprecating lines, a folksy Midwestern persona, an embrace of raising taxes on the rich to help middle-class people and sharp counterpunches. One of his biggest applause lines at the 2024 Democratic National Convention in Chicago — which he helped land for the city after promising Democratic officials that the more than $80 million affair would be debt-free — was that the audience should “take it from an actual billionaire” that Trump was rich in only one thing: “stupidity.”

He drew laughter at a more intimate Nevada delegation breakfast that week after telling delegates that few Illinois voters were looking for a “White Ukrainian American Jewish billionaire” to be their candidate when he first ran for governor in the 2018 election.

A belief in “kindness and empathy in government,” Pritzker argues, distinguishes him from Trump and his wealthiest allies. He points to his push for policies such as forgiving up to $1 billion in [medical debt](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://gov-pritzker-newsroom.prezly.com/gov-pritzker-announces-medical-debt-erased-for-170000-additional-illinois-residents) for working-class families and raising his state’s minimum wage to $15 an hour as examples of fighting for those who need it.

“That record, I think, belies the idea that every billionaire is a terrible person or is working against the interest of average working folks,” Pritzker said in a March interview with The Washington Post. “Your policies have to be about the people who need government the most.”

That appeal is being tested as Pritzker introduces himself outside Illinois as one of the most forceful critics of Trump. His pitch has done little to quell the criticism of activists who have raised concerns about the intermingling of money and politics and the barriers less-privileged people face to entering public office.

“There’s very few people who can afford to spend even a fraction of the money that Pritzker spent on his campaigns,” said Alisa Kaplan, executive director of Reform for Illinois, a group that advocates for greater transparency and public financing in elections. “You really want a system where that’s your pool of talent for your representatives?”

“I think it’s dangerous,” she said, “because even if you have this exception of the — quote, unquote — ‘good billionaire,’ it’s not a good basis for a political system.”

# Early exposure to business and politics

In the Pritzker family lore, the Illinois governor’s great-grandfather looms large. Nicholas Pritzker emigrated from Ukraine to the U.S. in 1881 when he was 10, after he, his father and his brother Abram fled the [pogroms](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://academic.oup.com/book/38825/chapter-abstract/350458566?redirectedFrom=fulltext) targeting Jews in Eastern Europe, according to Pritzker’s account of an unpublished family history written by his great-grandfather.

For their first eight to nine months in Chicago, the family “eked out a mere existence” and the 10-year-old boy slept many nights in the LaSalle Street Tunnel — avoiding the cold by packing newspapers “around my feet, legs and wrists,” Nicholas Pritzker wrote in another description. That passage was included in a history of the family that a distant Pritzker cousin published in 1962.

“There’s no doubt that I was one of the luckiest people alive,” Pritzker said in a summer interview in the black-walnut-paneled library of the historic governor’s mansion in Springfield, which he and his wife helped restore with $850,000 of their own money. “But it really grounds you when you understand that you came from a family that arrived here with nothing. That it wasn’t always like this.”

Nicholas Pritzker began his career shining shoes and selling newspapers, ultimately going to law school and starting a law firm that his children expanded through the generations into a thriving real estate and manufacturing enterprise, according to court documents and news reports. In 1957, Pritzker’s uncle Jay Pritzker bought a motel near the Los Angeles International Airport. Pritzker’s parents, Donald and Sue Pritzker, moved the family to California to run it. A year later, Pan Am began flying [Boeing 707s](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/707-flight-changed-everything-180971219/), ushering in the jet age of business travel. The Pritzkers expanded into other hotels near airports, laying the foundation for what would become the Hyatt Hotels empire.

Pritzker was from an early age a close observer of his parents’ business pursuits, recalling how his mother immersed herself in the design of each hotel — from the experience each guest had walking through the door to the hospitality services offered to VIPs. At home, the family living room was a hub of liberal social and political activity during the 1970s, when his parents welcomed guests including Nancy Pelosi, Jerry Brown and Barbara Boxer, he said.

Pritzker, the youngest child, said he often accompanied his mother to rallies and meetings in the ’70s as she advocated for abortion rights and gay rights. He remembers her sitting him and his siblings, Penny and Anthony, assembly-line-style at the dining room table to stuff envelopes with political literature, seal them and stamp them.

Tragedy struck when Pritzker was 7. His father died of a heart attack at 39 after playing tennis. His mother struggled with alcoholism and depression after losing her husband, Pritzker said. She was in and out of treatment, and he recalled waiting up some nights to pry the lit cigarette from his mother’s hand after she fell asleep. While Pritzker was away at boarding school, his mother died 10 years after her husband’s death, when she leaped from the moving cab of a truck that was towing her Cadillac, according to news reports from the time.

Pritzker went on to major in political science at Duke University and got an early taste of campaigning in North Carolina while he was still in school as a logistics aide for the U.S. Senate campaign of Terry Sanford, a former governor who had served as Duke’s president.

Mark Poole, a North Carolina contemporary who became close friends with Pritzker and would later manage his first run for office, recalled how Pritzker threw himself into the work — driving in his Saab from one end of the state to the other, gathering the concerns of North Carolina voters so he could brief Sanford before each event.

After Sanford won his Senate seat, Pritzker worked in Washington as his legislative assistant. He met his wife, Mary Kathryn — who came from a prominent Democratic South Dakota political family and is known as MK — on a 1988 blind lunch date at a cafe in the U.S. Capitol complex while he was working for then-Sen. Alan Dixon (D) of Illinois and she was working for then-Sen. Tom Daschle (D) of South Dakota, according to a Pritzker spokesperson.

Pritzker showed a continued interest in politics, founding Democratic Leadership for the 21st Century, a group that was focused on bringing more young leaders into Democratic politics, in 1991 while he was a student at Northwestern University School of Law. The internet was taking off in 1993 when Pritzker graduated, and in 1996, he started New World Ventures, a tech-focused venture capital firm that focused in part on Chicago-based start-ups. He avoided taking a job in the family business, inspired, he said, by his father’s example of striking out on his own.

In 1997, when the incumbent retired in Illinois’ 9th Congressional District, which included the North Side of Chicago and had a significant Jewish population, Pritzker saw an opportunity. He entered the 1998 race at 32 with long odds, facing two Democratic opponents with more established political networks. Rep. Jan Schakowsky was then a state representative and Pritzker’s other main rival, Howard Carroll, was a state senator.

Because the Pritzker family business and the Hyatt Hotel Corp. had been headquartered in Chicago, and because the family was involved in philanthropic endeavors, many voters revered the Pritzker name. Pritzker, however, quickly encountered critics skeptical of his thin résumé. Thom Mannard, who managed Carroll’s campaign, recalled a forum in which a student quizzed Pritzker about why “internships” in Washington qualified him to be a member of Congress.

Pritzker often found himself questioning “whether people were in it because they wanted to be in the gravitational pull of a Pritzker or because they were truly loyal to him,” according to Poole, who recalled receiving some asks that were off-putting to Pritzker.

“There’d be a group that would come to us and say, ‘We’d like to honor your candidate as Man of the Year, and it’s only going to cost you $50,000,’” Poole said. “We were trying to cut into what we knew were difficult dynamics with the race — without being seen as buying the election.”

Pritzker raised about $660,000 for his campaign and lent nearly $1.2 million of his own money to the effort, according to campaign finance records, but Mannard said the other two rival campaigns never felt “overwhelmed” by Pritzker’s spending and were surprised that his campaign did not go on air with television ads sooner than they did.

Pritzker finished third in the Democratic primary, with a little over 20 percent of the vote. Inexperience was the central hurdle for Pritzker, Mannard said. “There was a sense that Congress — as the first office that he was running for — it was a bit of a reach,” he said.

Mannard’s former colleague on Carroll’s campaign argued that Pritzker’s wealth has, beginning with that first race, shaped voters’ image of him more than anything else.

“The primary selling point of JB Pritzker — when he first ran for the offices that he ran for in challenger races — was that he has money,” said David Sirota, who was a researcher for the Carroll campaign and later served as adviser to Sanders’s presidential campaign. “It wasn’t like, ‘Oh he’s the guy who did X,’ or, ‘He’s carrying the torch for this or that cause.’ It was like, ‘He’s the guy who can write an unlimited check.’”

# ‘Does anybody want a wealthy guy on the Democratic side?’

After the loss, Pritzker focused on his venture firm as he and his wife became influential figures in Chicago’s philanthropic circles. The 1999 death of the family patriarch, his uncle Jay, led to the division of the family assets — a lengthy legal process that began in 2001 and ended about 2011. Each of the 11 Pritzker cousins, including JB, inherited $1.3 billion, according to court documents. (He has nearly tripled that fortune, according to his net worth as tracked by Forbes.)

As a couple, the Pritzkers founded the Pritzker Family Foundation in 2001 and put their money into efforts to improve early-childhood education and other causes, which raised their profile in Democratic circles. MK Pritzker became well-known for her advocacy for the rights of women in the criminal justice system. The Pritzkers also advocated for a state [assault weapons ban](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.cbsnews.com/chicago/news/pritzker-signs-illinois-assault-weapons-ban/) that Pritzker would later sign as governor in 2023.

In 2002, Pritzker and his brother Anthony formed the Pritzker Group, combining the venture firm with the acquisition of manufacturing and industrial service companies, including companies that developed the protective sleeves that slide onto coffee cups and the clamshell containers used to package fast-food burgers.

Politics continued to interest Pritzker. He was an early supporter of Hillary Clinton in the 2008 campaign, at a time when many of his state’s most prominent political Democrats — including his sister Penny Pritzker — were lining up behind then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois. The Pritzkers had bonded with Clinton, then a senator from New York, in 2006 after they were connected by a mutual friend and offered to host a fundraiser for her reelection campaign at their home in Evanston, according to his spokesman.

During the event, Pritzker was surprised by how his young daughter was captivated by Clinton, according to an aide familiar with this thinking, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private interactions. As he walked Clinton out, she asked to say goodbye to his daughter, kneeling down at eye level to talk to her and hug her, the aide said.

Clinton asked Pritzker to serve as national co-chair for her 2008 presidential campaign. When Clinton ran a second time in 2016, Pritzker and his wife were some of the largest donors to her effort, giving more than $17.5 million, including over $15 million to an allied super PAC. The size of the investment was made possible by a Supreme Court decision that erased limits on contributions to political committees that make independent expenditures, empowering wealthy financiers such as Pritzker.

On the night Trump defeated Clinton, Pritzker and his wife were surrounded by stunned Clinton supporters at her gathering at the Javits Center in New York. While some said they were swearing off politics, Pritzker recalled being even more determined to stay involved.

In 2017, Pritzker decided to challenge Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, another wealthy businessman who was [backed](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://abc7chicago.com/post/ken-griffin-gives-gov-rauner-$20-million-for-campaign/2009639/) by billionaire hedge fund mogul Ken Griffin, one of Pritzker’s rivals. The state was in a financial crisis, and Pritzker said his allies in the business community nudged him to take on Rauner, seeing him as the rare Democrat with the means to match the tens of millions of dollars of spending by Rauner and Griffin.

Pritzker saw Rauner as a multimillionaire “who was failing the state,” he said during the summer interview, and Trump “was maybe a billionaire failing the country.” He felt he could make an effective working-class pitch to counter Trump’s appeals, which had resonated across wide swaths of the Upper Midwest in 2016.

But he also remembered asking himself: “Does anybody want a wealthy guy on the Democratic side?”

Pritzker entered and ran on a platform of lifting families struggling economically, touting his business acumen and vowing to resolve Illinois’ fiscal crisis — in part by raising taxes on the rich. The state was in the midst of a two-year budget standoff between Rauner and the Democrat-dominated legislature that had resulted in a backlog of more than $16 billion in unpaid bills. To this day, the state faces financial challenges, including significant public pension debt.

His family wealth became a major issue in the 2018 Democratic primary, when Pritzker faced Daniel Biss, then a state senator, and Chris Kennedy, the son of former attorney general Robert F. Kennedy. They targeted the ways that prior generations of Pritzkers had, according to legal documents, sheltered some of the family’s money in about 1,000 foreign and domestic trusts and 250 companies. Pritzker pushed back by noting that the trusts were set up by his grandfather decades ago and involved the assets of multiple cousins and relatives.

“We are in this unique moment in America with massive income inequality, a failed billionaire president, a failed billionaire governor,” Biss said in a debate, referring to Trump and Rauner as he and Kennedy accused Pritzker of trying to “buy an election.”

Kennedy said in a recent interview that those attacks ultimately didn’t land in part because of what he saw as Pritzker’s everyman appeal — which he described as a “lack of arrogance and entitlement” — and an “ability to bond with people immediately.”

“His face is open, and it lights up when you meet him,” Kennedy said. “He’s physical. He’s not afraid to hug and to grab somebody with both hands, one on the hand and one on the shoulder, and embrace that moment when he first meets someone.”

In the general election, Rauner accused Pritzker of being a “tax cheat,” pointing to more than $330,000 in tax breaks that Pritzker and his wife sought after purchasing of a $3 million house next to their own on Chicago’s Gold Coast. The Pritzkers removed the toilets and argued the property was “uninhabitable,” prompting criticism from a county watchdog agency, according to documents revealed by local media. Ads from Rauner declared him “Chicago’s Porcelain Prince of Tax Avoidance.”

The Rauner campaign held news conferences with toilets next to the lectern and rented a “Pritzker Plumbing” van with a phone number on the side that would travel through Chicago and other cities when it rained. After dialing the number, people would hear a recorded message accusing Pritzker of taking advantage of the system and warning that he would raise taxes. It signed off with the flushing sound of water going down the drain.

A spokesperson for Pritzker noted that the assessor’s office had found multiple reasons the house was uninhabitable, including mold, structural issues and 2,300 square feet that was not livable.

During the campaign, Pritzker responded to Rauner’s portrayals of him as an out-of-touch plutocrat with ads that highlighted the Republican governor’s nine homes. One spot noted that Rauner had appealed his property taxes nearly two dozen times, questioning why he was attacking Pritzker for doing the same.

Rauner sought to argue that “this is an extremely wealthy man who doesn’t even want to pay the taxes that he owes,” said Ed Murphy, a former adviser to the Rauner campaign. “But it wasn’t enough.”

Pritzker won by nearly 16 percentage points. By the end, he had used more than $170 million of his own money in the campaign.

The spending enabled him to hire some 200 staff members, open nearly three dozen field offices and build a 2-to-1 ad spending advantage over the competition toward the end of the campaign.

Some expenditures still stick in the minds of rival operatives. Campaign finance reports showed the Pritzker team had spent more than $27,000 on Dunkin’ Donuts. “There were just things like that where it was astronomical,” said Betsy Ankney, a Republican strategist who was Rauner’s campaign manager in 2018.

“In any campaign, the budget is a total game of triage and prioritizing” Ankney said. “They just didn’t have to make those tough decisions. If they wanted to do something, they did it.”

# Clashing with Trump and venturing beyond Illinois

After taking office, Pritzker spearheaded an ultimately unsuccessful ballot campaign to change Illinois’ tax structure that would have given him more freedom to raise taxes on the wealthy, contributing $58 million of his own money to the ballot campaign and urging voters to tax people like him more. (Griffin once again served as his chief adversary, spending nearly $54 million to defeat Pritzker’s proposed amendment).

The governor’s legislative moves had pleased liberals: The first big bill that he pushed through the legislature with Democratic lawmakers after being elected governor was to raise the state’s minimum wage from $8.25 an hour to $15 an hour.

After spending $152 million on his reelection bid, Pritzker easily won a second term in 2022. He drew accolades for addressing the state’s fiscal stalemate after a budget impasse, reducing the backlog of state bills and notching credit upgrades for Illinois.

As he runs for a third term as governor of Illinois, Pritzker has pushed off questions about whether he will run for the White House in 2028 but has also said he won’t rule it out.

In recent years, Pritzker has sharpened his focus on causes beyond Illinois. After the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned *Roe v. Wade,* which had guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion, he founded the tax-exempt nonprofit Think Big to promote access to abortion and advance ballot measures enshrining abortion rights in states attempting to restrict them.

The Illinois governor seeded the group, which is not required to reveal its donors, with his own money. In its filing for the 2024 fiscal year, the most recent available from the IRS, Think Big reported $6.8 million in revenue. The group contributed more than $3.6 million to abortion-related causes, the filing showed.

Pritzker also vowed to make Illinois a [safe haven](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.mystateline.com/news/local-news/pritzker-signs-laws-to-ensure-illinois-remains-an-abortion-oasis/) for abortion, in part because it was surrounded by states that have restricted the procedure. In 2023 and 2024, Think Big contributed to abortion rights groups that were advancing ballot measures in nine states including Ohio, Nevada, Arizona, Montana, Nebraska and Florida, spending millions on ads, organizing campaigns and mailings. They were on the winning side in seven.

Pritzker has been an unusual “partner,” said Mini Timmaraju, the president of Reproductive Freedom for All, one who has helped her organization think through strategy on ballot measures and gotten directly involved in the field work.

“They’re not just writing checks,” Timmaraju said. “They’re getting in the states. Their strategists are working hand and glove with our staff in all these places.”

As part of Pritzker’s effort to bolster abortion rights and other Democratic causes, Pritzker and his wife have personally given at least $9 million to state Democratic parties since 2015 — both in battlegrounds that determine midterm and presidential races and red states such as Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky and Ohio. Of the $348 million Pritzker contributed to his first two gubernatorial campaigns, he disbursed more than $60 million to other candidates and political committees to help lift Democratic candidates, according to an analysis of campaign finance records.

Some say they see a troubling dynamic resulting from Pritzker’s wide net of political investments.

“He’s used the money to build political relationships for himself,” Sirota said. “If somebody’s been funded by JB, or been helped by JB, will they help him because they feel sort of an obligation? There’s the other layer of somebody’s been helped by JB — and if they don’t help him, they’re not going to get any more help in the future, right?”

Pritzker has deployed his wealth in other ways that have drawn attention. He has supplemented pay increases for his aides. And he used his personal and campaign funds — $4.5 million of the latter from 2017 to 2024, according to records — to pay for flights on private jets for political and official business.

Pritzker’s wealth came under a renewed spotlight this fall when his campaign released tax summaries [revealing](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/10/16/pritzer-gambling-earnings-las-vegas/) $1.4 million in blackjack winnings from a 2024 trip to Las Vegas. His office said he would donate his recent winnings to charity.

This year, Pritzker has sought to introduce himself to audiences in some early presidential states. In April, he fired up a room of hundreds of Democrats in New Hampshire, tearing into Trump for what he called his “authoritarian power grabs” and castigating those in his own party who believe they can “reason or negotiate with a madman.”

Pritzker’s scathing attacks on Trump and “do-nothing” Democrats have attracted attention in the party — especially because he started them in the days after Trump’s election, when other top Democrats, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, were still counseling caution or voicing hope that they could work with Trump.

Before the New Hampshire speech, more than a dozen Democrats in the room said they knew little about Pritzker beyond his wealth. But many left with a positive impression.

“Maybe it’s even nice to have someone who can pay for his own campaign, then the rest of us don’t have to pay for it,” said Patrick Long, a 37-year-old attorney from Manchester.

Howard Wolfson, a longtime adviser to former New York mayor and presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire who self-funded his short-lived 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, predicted that Pritzker’s wealth “will be a barrier for some voters.” But he added: “In a time when there is an enormous amount of corruption in government and concerns about special interest power, the idea that you have somebody who is free and clear of that is potentially very attractive to some people.”

Trump, who has built a national movement with many working-class supporters, has frequently attacked Pritzker, insulting his weight during the annual White House turkey pardoning and suggesting earlier in the fall that he should be “in jail” for his treatment of federal immigration agents. The administration launched [an immigration enforcement operation](https://archive.is/o/KPiy3/https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/09/08/ice-midway-blitz-chicago-trump/) in Chicago in September as part of a crackdown on violent crime and illegal immigration.

This summer, when Trump first talked about deploying the National Guard in Chicago, Pritzker called the president “a bully” with “dementia.” He mocked Trump’s dark descriptions of his state by playing the role of vest-wearing combat zone correspondent “reporting from war-torn Chicago” on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”

Teri Ricci, a 65-year-old retired university employee from Carbondale, Illinois, said she initially had no interest in backing “just another gazillionaire,” but ended up volunteering for Pritzker’s gubernatorial campaigns.

“He’s not in it for the money. He’s already got the money,” Ricci said in an interview at a Pritzker campaign event this summer as he launched his reelection bid. The first time Ricci heard him speak, Pritzker told the crowd that the good thing about having a lot of money was that he was not beholden to anyone.

1po5ang,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoShillReviews/comments/1po5ang/review_of_apple_magic_keyboard/,Review of Apple Magic Keyboard,"Three thousand people just dropped a Benjamin on a keyboard that looks like it was carved from a single bar of soap, and somehow most of them seem thrilled about it.

Let's call the elephant in the room what it is: you're paying laptop prices for something that just types letters. Ninety-five bucks could buy a decent graphics tablet, a month's worth of coffee, or literally any other Bluetooth keyboard on Amazon with change left over for tacos.

Yet the reviews keep rolling in at 4.6 stars, which suggests either Apple has perfected mind control or this thing actually just works without drama. The ""pairs automatically with your Mac"" claim isn't marketing fluff - it's Apple leveraging the same ecosystem lock-in that makes AirPods feel magical and makes your wallet feel lighter.

That ""month or more"" battery life claim deserves the raised eyebrow emoji we can't use. Real-world usage probably lands closer to three weeks if you remember to turn it off, which nobody does because who turns off a keyboard?

Here's where it gets interesting: the people leaving five-star reviews aren't comparing this to other keyboards. They're comparing it to the nightmare of cheap $30 plastic slabs that die after six months, require AAA batteries, and feel like typing on stale marshmallows. The Magic Keyboard becomes the least frustrating option by default.

The single product image tells you everything about Apple's confidence. They know you already know what this looks like. It's the same keyboard that ships with every iMac, just untethered and marked up like concert tickets.

Justifiable purchase? Sure, if you're a writer who stares at words for eight hours daily and values your wrists more than your weekend entertainment budget. Or if you already live in Apple's ecosystem and want devices that talk to each other without downloading seventeen different apps and drivers.

Everyone else should probably buy the $40 Logitech and spend the remaining $55 on therapy for the guilt they'll feel about not buying the Apple version.

1po55rh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPOinPH/comments/1po55rh/keywords/,Keywords,"honestly we don’t really get why Keywords Studios Manila was included in Great Place To Work. It doesn’t feel like the stress-free company they used to claim they were.

There’s a one project right now that’s extremely stressful, and keywords doesn’t really listen to agents’ concerns. It’s so intense that it’s already affected the mental health of some agents who are actually performing well. Even when you’re doing your job properly, the pressure never stops.

this December, some agents wanted to use their leave to spend Christmas with their families, but on one project, management didn’t allow it. Instead, they were required to report to work and were offered higher daily pay in exchange for not taking their leave. That doesn’t really feel like a choice.

Before, Keywords allowed employees to work on laptops and even work outside their homes, which helped a lot especially for those who felt suffocated or just needed a change of environment. Now everyone is required to use PCs and work strictly from inside their homes. I get the security concerns, but it would be nice if they at least gave agents the option to use personal laptops with proper admin controls or security software. A lot of agents would even be willing to buy their own laptops and have them configured just to be able to work somewhere else, like a coffee shop.

On top of all that, employees are being pressured to respond positively to the Great Place To Work survey so the company can win again. I just hope management eventually learns to listen to the employees too, not just the surveys.",4,1765899764.0,BPOinPH,1,1.0,False

Lassiter drove her relentlessly.  A perfectionist with little patience for mistakes, he was not an easy man to work for.

Her office on the third floor of the Treasury Building soon looked like the quarters of some demented terrorist determined to bring down the American financial system. It was packed with strange-looking equipment, the ornate walls covered with her family-tree style interconnection diagrams and greatly magnified sections of fake one hundred dollar notes.  One day there were so many half-full coffee cups lying around that it reminded her—painfully—of Nick’s office.

She was a neat and orderly person, but there was no time to tidy it up.

“You can clean up the mess later,” Lassiter would scold, “when this goddam project is finished.”

Her days became an endless blur.  All the data was kept on a secure data key the size of a salt shaker, which they appropriately called, “the salt shaker.”   Coming into work, Lassiter taking the bills and salt shaker out of his safe, going to her office, endlessly comparing the notes to each other with all her technological aids, going back to Lassiter’s office each evening, returning the fake bills and the salt shaker to the safe, and going back to the hotel.  Her vision seemed blurry most of the time, her eyes bloodshot, her neck and back aching from bending to look through microscope lenses all day.  She welcomed the exhaustion.

She worked Monday through Saturday.  On Sundays, she took the day off.

She slept all day and treated herself to room service.

Otherwise, she survived on a diet of caffeine and fast food.  She lost five pounds the first month.  

She thought of Nick often.  By the end of October, she still hadn’t said a word to Lassiter about him—she was afraid to speak of Nick.  Lassiter had given her strict orders not to have any further contact with him, or anyone else in the Secret Service.  Elaine was registered at the hotel under a false name provided by Lassiter, and he had given her a new secure cellphone and number to use.  She was sure the old man had taken these precautions so that Nick could not contact her, but he never said as much.  She had a distinct feeling that he knew there had been more than a friendship between the two of them.

A week before Thanksgiving, Elaine finally got the nerve to ask him about Nick.  Lassiter was in her office. He was sitting at her light table, with his back to her, peering through a loupe, going over some of the common defects she had found in the fakes.

“LaGrange?” he said, not moving his head.  “I heard he was arrested a few weeks ago.”

Elaine felt a sharp pang in her chest.  “Is he...in jail?”

Lassiter turned around and glanced at her.  “From what I understand, he’s being held by Interpol in Brussels.  When they’re done interrogating him, he’ll be sent to one of the CIA centers and then...I don’t know.  He’ll eventually face a criminal trial here in the States.”

“So I guess they caught him accepting a bribe or something...”

“I suppose,” Lassiter said vaguely.  “I only know he was arrested.”

Elaine felt sick.  An image flashed before her—her father, standing on the other side of the glass in the prison visitor’s room, his face sallow, dark circles under his eyes.   Nick would probably be in captivity the rest of his life, unless he could somehow escape.  

She told herself she would put Nick LaGrange out of her mind, once and for all.



\* \* \*

Gene Lassiter entered the lobby of the hotel about three p.m., as he did each and every day.

“Anything for me?” he said to the manager on duty.

“Another one of these,” the man said, discreetly handing over an envelope.

Written across the front in handwriting that Lassiter recognized were the words DELIVER TO ROOM 628.  PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL.

It was the third one that had been received.

Later that night, Lassiter sat down in the den of his comfortable Georgetown home, the fire crackling in front of him.  Leaning his cane against the couch, he pulled the envelope from his suit pocket.  He tore it open and he began to read.

*Dear Elaine...*

There was only one heartfelt-written paragraph, and then Nick’s signature.

*How touching*, Lassiter thought.

He tossed it into the fire.

The issue is that next term they’re only offering A1 or B1, no A2.

I’m currently a low A2. I’ve been learning Spanish for about three months, basically since I moved here for school. I spoke to the EOI and I don’t need to fully pass the B1 placement test.  I just need to get close enough to be placed in the class. My plan is to place into B1 and then fill in the gaps as I go.

Extra context: My school term ends this Friday, so after that I’ll be able to throw myself into Spanish much more intensely. I’m basically planning a short-term Spanish bootcamp to maximize my chances of placing into B1 class.

Current level / skills

* Reading: strong for my level. I love reading and absorb vocab/grammar well. Currently reading El lugar más bonito del mundo by Ann Cameron.
* Writing: decent, but spelling is weak.
* Speaking: by far my weakest skill.  I’m working on it through language exchanges with Spaniards.

Right now i am doing, Language Transfer (on track to finish around Jan 10, Coffee Break Spanish (just finished Season 2; planning to do more listening-focused content like Coffee Break To Go / Magazine) → \~1.5 hours/day total, Reading: \~1 hour/day Dreaming Spanish: \~30 minutes/day (I really don’t love TV, but I’m pushing through) and Kwiziq for grammar,  finishing up A2 (currently \~60%) also doing Duolingo but mostly for vocab and “thinking in Spanish” time

I am going to add speaking out loud for 3 minutes/day on a topic, journaling, actively thinking in Spanish and narrating what I’m doing and asking Spanish friends to help me practice speaking with prompts. 

I also kinda have a subject for each week, this week: connectors (porque, aunque, mientras, etc.) Next week: sentence building / restructuring (kind of sentence mining)

At the moment, though, it honestly feels like I’m just swinging a bat in the dark and hoping to hit something. I’m putting in the hours, but I don’t always know if I’m targeting the right things for a B1 placement test.

Also, just to be clear: I’m a broke college student, so private one-on-one classes or tutors aren’t really an option. I’m trying to make the most of free or low-cost resources and native speaker friends.

1. What should I be prioritizing specifically to get close enough to B1 in a month?
2. Is there a clear checklist of B1 requirements (especially for EOI-style placement tests)?
3. For speaking, what kind of prompts should I practice that are realistic for a B1 placement test?
4. If you had one month, decent reading skills, weak speaking, and no money for tutors — what would you focus on?
5. Is there anything I should drop, even if it feels productive?

I’m not trying to magically be B1 in a month,  I just want to be good enough to place into the class and survive it.

Its been two months since I finally went NC with my pwBPD. I had known them my whole life, over 3 decades, and was in love with them the whole time. The last 6 years we were actually, finally, together and I thought I had found my home at last.  
     
But you dont really know a person until you see them at their worst. Or until you see their  best is actually a practiced routine you only get to see from the outside. Once your in, the mask starts to drop.  
    
Eveeytime I tried to leave they would say ""what? Are you just going to die alone?"" like they were my best option  to grow old with somebody. But I was growing old with them in real time. I have probably aged 15 years in the face and my body in the 6 we were together.  
    
Its been 2 months since going NC for real. Im better at my job. Im more present for other people. Im back to being good at my job. Im not constantly worried of setting another person off by just speaking a single word wrong. I might die alone but it will at least be as a free person with my own wants and needs.  
    
So for all if you I promise its better to be alone than with the wrong person. I had the quentisential dream come true relationship and it killed me watching it disappear slowly. It still feels like I lost a big chunk of myself. But sometimes you have to cut a part of yourself off so the rest can survive.     
    
The first month it was doom and gloom. Then another month of adjusting, rebuilding, surviving. Now it feels like the clouds are starting to part. I woke up with my pets. I did my routine. I drank my coffee. And I was at peace.  
    
No worries of dying alone. No hearing their voice disparaging  me. Just the thought of the things I can do now without them and the memory of all the things they did to me.  
     
So hold out. Your brain adjusts. You're going through person withdrawals. You will get to a place of peace if you just focus on you and where you are going by making steps in a direction. Any direction. And they dont have to be big steps. They just have to be a step. They add up and you find yourself in a better place no matter which way you go.

There are moments when we

must stop

and look

and tend to

the unexpected and

deeply welcomed,

simply because

we live.

  


A lemonade stand

at the edge of the road,

cardboard sign wavering

between LEMONADE and LEMONAED.

The coins wait in a jar,

oblong ice accepts its fate

as tiny fingers stir

through mostly water.

Engines reconsider.

Appointments learn patience.

Briefcases bloom with splashes of sugar

any bee would envy.

  


My cat arrives

with the object he loves most.

Not the clean one.

The true one.

He sets it down carefully,

then looks up,

as if to say:

you’ll want to see this.

And I do.

The afternoon brightens,

pleased with itself.

Thoughts wander off

without wearing their shoes.

  


My eyes squint

in mixed morning light—

the bulb above the kitchen sink

and ribbons of sunrise through open blinds.

Coffee steams.

I smell it before I see it,

and then I do—

steam lifts

just as light

reaches the window.

Waking,

and God,

and refreshment

keep company

1po4yt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1po4yt5/alcohol_can_be_just_as_bad_if_not_worse_than/,"Alcohol can be just as bad, if not worse than Marijuana.","So today would be the birthday of one of my favorite comedians whose name is Bill Hicks, bill was about my age or not at all much older when he passed away in his early thirties, and I'm in my early thirties now. 

Alcohol was so socially acceptable when I was younger, and I would estimate about 90% or even higher of my friends group we're using drugs and alcohol at least on a weekend basis. 

I often get frustrated when more people will point out that I'm drug addict because of marijuana when the reality is alcohol was no better, and that's why I think giving up these things again would absolutely better my life just like it did 4 years earlier when I stopped in December of 2021. I remember how much fun I had when I gave up alcohol because I wanted to do a particular amount of days which I remember being 145, I also went 1,672 days without cigarettes. 

I'm pretty sure that if I quit using all these things, it would better my life and when I did all that, I didn't even need rehab or therapy because I was doing it myself and put in the work and effort in and I remember how proud I was of at the time. 

I was drinking no beer, smoking no weed or cigarettes, and even though I was binging on the caffeine pretty hard with the 22 jump Street circa April 1, 2022. I still felt great and my dreams were so awesome because when you smoke a lot of weed, it can negatively affect the REM cycles and I can never remember my dreams but whenever I quit my dreams become absolutely wild and I absolutely love it like on the star of my own movie, that is why the biggest three breaks I had off weed that were all above 50 days were so much better qualities of life, and it's sad that I ended up going back each time and addiction will forever be a battle where I won that battle, but absolutely failed the war in a sense. 

I will also mention that I do have CHS, and a lot of people probably don't know what that is but it's a rare condition that causes cyclic vomiting from smoking too much marijuana. These episodes are absolutely hell and I've had the displeasures of living through them. 

My first episode was on January 4, 2017. I have had about 40 episodes in that time. 

I also fucked up when I was out west 3 years earlier, taking a bus from Calgary to Edmonton and I remember distinctively having two beer cans with me for the 4-Hour bus ride and when we were at the Red Deer stop and unfortunately the driver call me drinking the second can. 

This was stupid of me, and I remember feeling horrible about it and I remember that there was a 35-45 year old woman who was a hard right-winged Republican just like me, but what she didn't like was how I was drinking beer on the bus and she had an alcoholic husband and she would have to deal with his shit so I understand why she lost it on me at the station. 

My bus ticket from Calgary to Edmonton was only about $30 but I had to pay $55.28 on November 8, 2022, the bus ticket was twice the price for half the distance, as Red Deer is exactly halfway between the South and North Alberta centers (Calgary and Edmonton). 

Also when I pulled out my weed pen and told her that I'm addicted to other shit too she literally did not give a shit. Cool pen kid... I really don't care... 

What she did care about was that I had two beers on the bus, and yes, I know it was a stupid thing to do, but I got really scared when she started screaming at me in the station. 

I apologized profusely, and I knew my mistake was having the two beers on the bus, when I should have had the two energy drinks because that wouldn't have been a problem. 

It's also worse for me because when I was in Alberta 9 months earlier, that was during my 168 day no alcohol streak and I wasn't drinking at that time and I remember my hotel room at the Empire suites in gasoline Alley at the south end of Red Deer had a liquor store in it and I didn't go there even once. 

The place that I worked at was a fast food place called Carl's Jr. they also never paid me and there was nothing I could do about it because I'm a guy from Ontario and they're in Alberta so unfortunately I was a case of shit out luck. 

And holy fuck that train ride from Edmonton back to Toronto and home was an absolutely insane roller coaster of both highs and lows. 

We were going almost 100 miles an hour past train cars and I knew about the Hinton rail disaster that happened in 1986 and my anxiety was really fucked and I remember too we had the wear masks and they were always catching me sipping my drink and kept on calling me out for not having it on and it was super annoying and when I was in Winnipeg because they caught me without my mask drinking my coffee for a third time because I can't drink my coffee when I have my mask on they were threatening to throw me off the train and in Winnipeg when it was -36'C.

I’m a guy in my early 30s working in Europe. A male coworker from Brazil (also early 30s, very introverted engineer type from south brazil) joined our lab less than a year ago. At first we were friendly but not close. Early on, he declined a suggestion to travel together.

Over the last few months, things changed. We started working more closely, and now:

* He asked me to see a Brazilian movie **one-on-one**
* He put it in his calendar and said he’s looking forward to it
* We also went together to a Christmas market, just the two of us, for a couple of hours
* He asked if I’d be staying here for Christmas and seemed genuinely happy when I said yes
* Recently, almost any one-on-one suggestion I make, he replies “I’m in”
* Even for coffee breaks, he’ll sometimes join just to chat

He used to have ex-girlfriend. He’s much warmer one-on-one but very reserved in group/work settings. Since we’re coworkers, I’m cautious about misreading signals.

**Does this sound more like romantic interest, or could this still reasonably be close friendship — especially given cultural differences and his introverted personality?**

I do water them once per week well, and I let the soil dry out in-between watering. I noticed most of this glossiness occurred after I added fertilizer to it. I added a tiny bit of coffee grounds and eggshells about month ago to the top of the soil and noticed the increase in growth. I know its not plant rust on the leaves making the orange color as the color changes depending if I change the location of the plants.

My father is dying and planning on giving me 250k in his will. He has 3 children, but I'm the only one he wants to leave money too because they are not in his life. He was abusive to them growing up and they rightfully decided he doesnt put effort enough to be apart of their adult lives. My sister has loads of debts, but has a stable career, two kids, and doing okay living check to check. Albeit stressful. My brother is more than okay, great career in the medical field, retiring from military, and married to a trust fund baby with two kids as well.

I am in my early thirties, I've recently ran into legal troubles and am currently with no career, no home, no kids, no reliable car, and really no current prospects for any of the above mentioned. I have a broken down car that my mom not only purchased, but put at least 7k worth of work into. I have an associates degree and about 90 transferable college credits, about 120 total. About 60k in debts(loans and credit cards combined), but I also own everything I need to make a livable home. A bed, and couch, kitchen appliances, coffee/end tables, desk, bookshelves, anything I really want or need. 

My dilemma is I feel guilty if i don't share this money with my siblings, or even my mother. I feel my brother is okay, but my sister could use some financial help and there have been many of times my mom helped me with her own retirement funds, jeopardizing her own retirement to where she has now had to look for a job to get back to even earing a part time income. Although she isnt having any luck, she has been able to substitute on rare occasions this year and her husband(my stepdad) still works and pays all the main home bills for her to be okay.

With my plans, I want to maybe finish my bachelor's to a career that can sustain me. I have an associates in electronics technology, but the world and AI makes me question which direction I want to go as working hard labor doesn't feel like the direction I want to take(I have terrible back problems and leg nerve pains and arthritis developing in my hands and forearm from it). I want to also find a cheap home/land. Whether its a trailer, tiny home, or even an RV. And hopefully afford a reliable car, something that could last me about 10-15years. Maybe a reliable car or another cash car(but that could come with its own costs fixing it up, but a reliable car I feel would cost more).

To accomplish this long term, my partner that we are planning a life together with, is now in a stable career, but he doesn't make much money. He has 5 kids from a previous marriage, with back pay child support debt of his own. Although we are planning on getting a home that he can afford the mortgage on his salary alone, I would still more than likely need to help with the down payment or a lump some to get us into something more affordable long term(low monthly payment/low interest hopefully).

To add to the dilemma, my partner has his own debts about 40k including the back pay, and has been trying for years and hoping we could make it possible to fix his teeth with this money. He has never had dental and in his early 20s, he busted his face and mouth on pavement, and his teeth have always been his biggest insecurity. He's actually a super talented singer too, and would do music on the side, but he's too ashamed of his teeth to be confident and comfortable enough to sing. He did professionally sing in a band in his late teens and early twenties before this happened.

As you can see, all this has added up already to a point where I would feel shame not giving my sister or mother some funds out of this money, but I feel I need every penny. My financial literacy was never the best growing up, but I used to be able to afford my monthly bills with never a missed payment until this legal trouble where I lost my career which occurred this past year.

I need advice of what you would do in this situation. I wanted to start off with giving 10k to both my mom and sister, maybe my brother like 5k. Pay down my debts about 80-90% down. Limit about 10k for a first home buyers loan for a property/place. And frankly, if I could get the back pay of my partners child support paid(we would have a larger monthly income), 2 years for one to turn 18 and 4 years for another to turn 18, so that monthly income will grow over time. Then start an online bachelor's course that I can afford to get a decent job with(something with great career placement and job security).

I feel like if I'm willing to fix my partners teeth, I should be willing to give my sister the same amount too. My own want, if anything, would be the ability to get liposuction. I could always do an ozempic alternative, but I've always wanted a breast reduction and to perk and sculpt things up a bit. It's not a need, but a want, as I've unfortunately gotten depressed this past year and just let myself go in the worst way. All in all, if I have stability in my life(home, career, mental health) then I can be in a better place to always help my mother when needed in the future when her retirement funds run out(which unfortunately is already very close due to all the assistance she's given me this past year). I also feel like I should invest some, or start a business of some sort, or pay my debt off fully. 


Please please tell me, what would you do if you were me? I'm sure I'm not considering the taxes I'll have to pay in this money as well so if anyone has any experience or any expectations I should have on this, that would also be helpful. Sorry for the long read!",1,1765899055.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

I've always wondered what's wrong with me? Now I have recently learned about hypervigilance and I think that it close to how I feel all the time.

I'll explain my situation and hopefully someone can understand and clarify what is happening with me.

For as long as I can remember, I've always felt very self conscious out in public. I don't actually think that people are looking at me but I just feel very uncomfortable in public spaces. I just can't seem to relax and be in my own space.

One of the most telling traits is that I am acutely aware of everyone and everything around me. I don't actually perceive them as a threat but I have just this constant heightened awareness that makes me feel so uncomfortable and anxious. 

Even when I am at home alone I find myself looking out the window to see what is happening in my street or what my neighbours are doing.

Like I really only leave the house if I have an actual purpose. I have a full time job and it brings me into contact with people but outside of work I just don't want to be outside.

I talk to people who say that they would happily sit in a coffee shop alone and relax. The thought of me doing that is so far out of my comfort zone it's ridiculous. 

I can't use a public toilet unless I know that it's pretty empty or I can go to a cubicle.

I can't explain how it makes me feel. It's not an actual fear, more like self conscious, hypervigilant uncomfortable awareness. 

Can someone explain what this is and more importantly how do I get over it? The brute force method of doing the uncomfortable thing hasn't worked but it's the only option that I have at my disposal at the moment.

1po4qbe,https://v.redd.it/thyxy1wz2l7g1,I built a small productivity app because I kept falling back to pen & paper — doing a $7/year New Year deal,"Hey everyone,

I’m an indie dev and over the last year I’ve been building a productivity app called **Zenleaps**.

Honestly, this started because my partner and I couldn’t stick to tools like Todoist, Evernote, or Obsidian. We’d get excited, over-organise everything… and two weeks later end up back on pen and paper or WhatsApp notes 😅

So Zenleaps is intentionally **simple**:

* notes, tasks, and lists in one place
* offline-first (works without internet)
* clean, minimal UI
* no pressure to “set it up perfectly”

You can just write things down and let structure emerge later.

For New Year’s, I’m running a **$7 for the entire year** deal (basically coffee money) to get more real users in and feedback while I keep improving it. There’s also a solid free tier if you just want to try it first.

I’m not trying to compete with the big players — just building something that finally worked for us, and maybe helps someone else start 2025 a bit more organised.

If you’re curious, search [Zenleaps](https://zenleaps.com/redirect) on the App Store / Play Store.  
Happy to answer questions or take feedback (good or bad).

Cheers 🙌

During the time we were closest she had a “roster” of boys that she didn’t really like and just liked the attention of and she was pretty fresh from a year long breakup.

We eventually decided that after a year of being friends and having a few meet ups that in retrospect were definitely just dates (coffee and long walks, playing games in the same bed ect.) we would have a month to try it out and I was so determined to be a great partner and I already had her Christmas gifts planned which were gonna be her favourite flowers. 

We told people fast that we were together even though I was hesitant because I wanted to just enjoy being a couple and we were just in a trail phase but over the course of the next week she slowly got distant and started like getting less and less committed.

I went from being her girlfriend, to then her partner then to not even having a title and wanting space and then breaking up entirely and she told all of our friends it was a mutual breakup even though it wasn’t. She said the reason we broke up was because she wasn’t ready for a relationship, bringing up her mental health issues and then the next Monday she went on a date with a boy.

I’m a trans woman who presents largely androgynous but like I don’t pass 9/10 times so I can’t help but feel that she broke up because she didn’t want to be with either a woman (even though she’s bi) or she felt fine with me because I’m androgynous enough. When I’ve spoken to my friends about it apparently shed misgendered me behind my back and they think that she only agreed with a trial month to get it over with… which didn’t even make it into two weeks.

1po4myj,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Prize-Drive1781/comments/1po4myj/cold_brew_at_home_in_5_minutes_the_busy/,Cold Brew at Home in 5 Minutes: The Busy Professional's Guide to Iced Coffee Perfection,"Let's be honest: true cold brew takes 12-24 hours to steep. But here's the thing: the actual *work* takes just 5 minutes. The rest happens while you're sleeping, working, or binge-watching your favorite show. [www.coffeeduke.com](http://www.coffeeduke.com) 

As a busy professional, you need coffee solutions that fit your schedule, not the other way around. Here's how to master the art of effortless iced coffee that saves you time and money.

# The Reality Check: Two Paths to Iced Coffee Perfection

**Path 1: Traditional Cold Brew** (5 minutes prep, 12+ hours brewing)  
**Path 2: Instant Iced Coffee** (Literally 2 minutes from pod to cup)

Both have their place in your busy life. Let's break down when to use each.

# Traditional Cold Brew: Sunday Prep, Week-Long Rewards

# What You Need

* 1 cup coarsely ground coffee (Coffee Duke's freshly roasted beans work perfectly)
* 4 cups filtered water
* Large mason jar or pitcher
* Fine-mesh strainer or coffee filter

# The 5-Minute Setup

1. **Grind coarse** (like sea salt texture)
2. **Mix** coffee and water in your container
3. **Stir** well: 30 seconds max
4. **Cover** and forget about it
5. **Set a phone reminder** for tomorrow evening

That's it. You've just invested 5 minutes for a week's worth of premium iced coffee.

# The Next Day: 2-Minute Strain

Pour through your strainer into a clean container. Store in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Mix 1:1 with water or milk when serving.

**Pro tip:** Make a double batch on Sunday. Your future self will thank you when Wednesday hits and you're running on fumes.

# The Instant Route: K-Cup Pods for Maximum Speed

Sometimes you need iced coffee *now*. This is where Coffee Duke's K-Cup pods shine.

# The 2-Minute Method

1. **Brew strong** over a cup half-filled with ice
2. **Add cold water or milk** to taste
3. **Stir and go**

The ice melts just enough to create the perfect dilution. No waiting, no planning, just instant satisfaction.



# Why Busy Professionals Are Switching to At-Home Cold Brew

**Time savings:** 15 minutes in coffee shop lines vs. 30 seconds pouring from your fridge

**Cost savings:** $4.50 daily coffee shop habit = $1,350 yearly. Home brewing costs about $0.50 per cup

**Consistency:** Your coffee, your strength, your schedule

**Quality control:** You know exactly what's in your cup

# Making It Work with Your Schedule

# Monday Motivation

Start strong with pre-made cold brew concentrate. Add a splash of your favorite milk and head out the door.

# Midweek Madness

When time is tight, K-Cup pods over ice are your lifeline. Consistent, fast, and still way better than gas station coffee.

# Friday Wind-Down

Mix cold brew with a splash of vanilla or cinnamon. You've earned it.

# The Coffee Duke Advantage

Here's why switching to Coffee Duke makes sense for your busy lifestyle:

**Freshly roasted in the USA:** Your coffee arrives at peak flavor, not months old like grocery store brands

**Free shipping:** No more ""quick"" coffee runs that turn into 20-minute detours

**K-Cup compatibility:** Works with your existing single-serve machine: no new equipment needed

**Bulk options:** Stock up once, coffee sorted for months

# Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

**Using fine grounds for cold brew:** Creates bitter, over-extracted coffee. Stick to coarse.

**Wrong ratios:** Too weak? Use more coffee, not less water. Too strong? Dilute when serving, not during brewing.

**Forgetting to make more:** Set recurring phone reminders. Sunday = cold brew prep day.

**Overthinking it:** This isn't rocket science. Good coffee + water + time = great results.

# Level Up Your Game

Once you've mastered the basics, experiment:

* **Add spices** during brewing (cinnamon stick, vanilla bean)
* **Try different milk alternatives** (oat milk creates incredible creaminess)
* **Make coffee ice cubes** from leftover coffee to prevent dilution

# Bottom Line

You don't need to sacrifice quality for convenience. With 5 minutes of Sunday prep or Coffee Duke's premium K-Cups, you can have café-quality iced coffee that fits your schedule and budget.

The best coffee habit is the one you'll actually stick to. Whether that's cold brew concentrate waiting in your fridge or K-Cups ready for instant gratification, the choice is yours.

Things were fine the first two years, but on year three things have gotten way worse. I became a team lead not because I wanted to but because I knew they were going to force me to train anyway so might as well get paid for it right.

There was a period of time lately where they made me and a few others close cash and dining as one position because we “couldn’t afford a dining person”…… yet we are on of the busiest cafes in the area we get hit hard most nights. I would have to run around like a mouse do the bubblers make sure bathrooms are done tables clean floors clean all the stocking all the trashes all the coffees etc. some nights I wouldn’t get out till 10:30 because there is just so much to clean at the end of the night when you out cash and dining together the job isn’t necessarily “hard” it’s just really aggravating.

Doing two jobs for the pay of one trying to run around do everything, and constantly running back to get customers add on the new cookie system and bread system where all the bread had to now be cut by cash at the end on the night and bag and sticker all the cookies not gunna happen some night I have to cut over 20 bread loafs which between customers takes forever.

I have been getting a dining person 3 out of 4 nights which is nice but they are minors and have to be out by 9 which leaves me to finish the job I have had them only leave me the mopping most nights which has been good. Except when they start because they were never trained on it so I have to do cash basically do dining and train them.

A couple really bad nights were when we had a busy busy Tuesday like on the door like church fundraiser bad… ppl complaining about. Dirty tables people getting mad at me a full screen in barista I had to walk into the freezer and have a panic attack my manager had to take orders for me for like 5 minutes. It was just too much way way too much. Another was when they had me closing cash dining and training on dining it sucked we didn’t even finish dining but the manager rushed us out I cried in my car after that shift and texted my manager says how I couldn’t possibly train and close two positions 🤦‍♀️

Then they want us to close the dining room to the same standard as if we had a cash and dining person…. What and get out on time I don’t think so. Then if I go away for a few days half the time I’d come back and the period garbage not empty or bunkers clean…. Like what.

Can’t tell if I’m being dramatic but I know I’m a good worker I’m just done staying past my time to do two jobs pay if one with the same standard…

Edit: forgot to add that all the cleaning tasks for the day the morning crew never does them no one enforces them to do them so they always fall on the closing crew",2,1765898430.0,PaneraEmployees,2,1.0,False

I've been drinking decaf as an alternative everyday since my OB told me to limit me caffeine intake at 8 weeks, and now I'm 27w+5d! Someone mentioned decaf chemical processes to me offhand and now I'm down the internet rabbit hole worrying because I already drank a pound of it.

From what I've found the FDA have deemed the trace chemicals found in decaf are safe for consumption but of course there's no studies on whether this can affect a baby. Tuna and sushi and cold cuts are also safe for consumption normally, but they warn us up and down to avoid these things, why was decaf coffee not one of the things we're warned about. If I was told about it I might have stuck to normal caffeine or tea or just done the research to find one of the decaf's that use one of the non-chemical processes.

**Ingredients**:

 

 

*Ingredients listed in order of use during cocktail preparation. Marshmallows should be prepared at least 12 hours in advance!*

 

 

• 100 grams strong coffee with chocolate notes (I used an Aeropress with 10.5 grams of medium fine coffee and 120 grams of 95 °C water, bloomed and then brewed for 5 minutes)

 

 

• 2 heaping Tbsp Dutch Process 100% cocoa powder (*ca*. 12 g)

 

 

• 1 heaping Tbsp Organic Cane Sugar (*ca*. 16 g)

 

 

• 1.0 oz Buttermilk

 

 

• 4.0 oz Whole milk

 

 

• Pinch of cinnamon powder

 

 

• Pinch of cayenne powder (optional)

 

 

• 2 dashes of Angostura Bitters

 

 

• 2 dashes of Peychaud’s Bitters

 

 

• 1.25 oz [Worthy Park 109 Proof](https://worthyparkestate.com/liquors/worthy-park-109-proof/)

 

 

• Garnish: Absinthe and peppermint marshmallows, placed into two piles on each half of the drink, so that when held by the handle you can sip from either the left or right side.

 

 

**Preparation:**

 

 

To a saucepan, add the cocoa powder (2 Tbsp), cane sugar (1 Tbsp), and buttermilk. Use a fork to vigorously combine the ingredients and break up any fatty lumps from the buttermilk. Add the coffee (100 grams) and place the saucepan over low heat, whisking with the fork to homogenize. Then add the whole milk (4 oz), Angostura Bitters (2 dashes), Peychaud’s Bitters (2 dashes), cinnamon (pinch), and cayenne (optional, pinch) and whisk with the fork. Turn up the heat and use a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the drink. Once the temperature of the liquid is 170 °F (77 °C), turn off the heat, add the Worthy Park 109 (1.25 oz) and whisk to homogenize. Transfer to a pre-warmed mug, then top with flavored marshmallows divided perpendicular to the handle.

 

 

**Notes/Profile:**

 

 

Heavenly Worthy Park banana and sugar caramel, layered with warm cocoa, fills the whole room. As you grab your warm mug and bring it to your lips, the intensity of the anisole from the absinthe marshmallows surprises you, but the peppermint eases you in with familiar holiday flavor. The hot cocoa is luscious, bitter, and dominant; the burn of the Worthy Park is intensified by the heat but it’s not enough to pull you out of the experience. The coffee provides you with a bitter throughline but is otherwise indistinguishable from pyrazine(y?) nuttiness of the chocolate. The mélange of cinnamon, Angostura, Peychaud’s, and cayenne accentuate, but don’t overwhelm the spicy, orange, floral character of the hot chocolate. When you sip from the peppermint marshmallow side, there is a pleasant cooling effect, and when you sip from the absinthe marshmallow side, the licorice becomes almost piney.

 

 

**Absinthe and Peppermint Marshmallows:**

 

 

Follow the Serious Eats recipe for [Classic Marshmallows]( https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-marshmallows-recipe), but at step 5, divide the gelatin syrup into two portions, then split the whipped egg whites. For the absinthe marshmallows, use one Tbsp of absinthe, and 4 drops of green food coloring. For the peppermint marshmallows, use 1.5 Tsp of peppermint extract, and four drops of red food coloring. Note that these amounts are effectively double the recipe and they do negatively impact the texture. A more attractive, but less flavorful alternative would be to mist absinthe and mint extract over store bought marshmallows. A more practical option for an actual bar would be to use an iSi whipper, but you won’t catch me dropping that much cash for such an extremely niche product anytime soon.",1,1765898264.0,cocktails,1,0.67,False

But over the past year, I’ve noticed a trend with her that has me feeling down.

It started when she wanted to do a trip away for her birthday at the beginning of the year, I couldn’t afford to go unfortunately. She still lives at home and has a solid income with practically no bills, meanwhile I have moved out and have a very limited income. I budget extremely well but I just don’t have the discretionary income that she does. Anyway I couldn’t go on the trip with her and another friend, but did go to her party. She also invited a friend to this party that we haven’t seen since our school days and honestly I thought we both agreed we didn’t like her much back then, but who am I to judge.

The year goes on and we only see each other two or three times the whole year, everytime just for a coffee because she doesn’t suggest anything else, and every time I do see her I notice she just doesn’t ask about me or my life at all other than the obligatory “how are you” when we first sit down. Once I realised this I look for it each time and it’s consistent. She just talks about herself and lets me ask questions for several hours. The frequency of us hanging out may be partially my fault, but honestly when I realised she doesn’t seem to care about what I’m up to, and also that she doesn’t care to suggest what we should do together, I just didn’t feel like reaching out much? That paired with the fact that she and this old friend plus a mutual friend of ours have been hanging out like crazy, going on multiple holidays together, cocktails, nights out, and they just had a “gals christmas”, just so much time spent together when it feels like even getting a coffee with me is a chore for her?

I feel like saying something about how this is making me feel, as I know I’m withdrawing even more from the friendship because of it and I know that’s making it worse, but I’m so bad with confrontation. I won’t go into it but in my past any confrontation has been met with gaslighting (from someone else) that as a result always makes me question if I’m imagining things. and I’ve never had a fight with this friend before so I don’t know how it will go. I’m convinced it’ll ruin the whole friendship or she’ll just deny it or blame me. How do I approach this? I feel like I’ve grown up and am getting on with being an adult, and I’ve just now noticed she hasn’t been maturing with me. I still love her as a friend, I just wished she seemed to care about me.",1,1765898248.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

He does a pour over every morning and relishes the precision and experimenting that comes with it: he starts with whole beans, uses a scale, grinds, uses a timer, etc. Not only does he love coffee, he loves the experience of learning and tweaking the process ever so slightly.

I want to be in a relationship with someone, but it seems that every girl I have ever met and became friends with since starting college, I have never been able to go past becoming more than just friends. I feel like I have blown NUMEROUS chances to be with a girl, but I am just blind, or just don't know how to make my intentions/motive clear.

I see a bunch of people my age being in relationships or are moving on to the next steps which is marriage including three of my close buddies whose weddings I have been in. I know I am not a bad person and have quite a number of girl friends I talk to regularly as friends. In fact, I am quite certain I have more girl friends than guy friends I talk to more.

I know I am not an ugly guy either, I just don't know how to make my intentions clear with girls to let them know that I like them or are interested in them. My girl friends have told me that I am too platonic. I honestly don't even know how to make intentions or be deliberate that I am interested in them. 

Like is it as simple as straight up asking ""Hey do you want to go on a date? Maybe get coffee?"". If they say no, move on? When I meet a new girl that I find I am interested in, how should I act around them? Do I compliment them? What do I do? Because whatever I have been doing for the past 7 or so years clearly has not worked at all (should I be surprised SMDH). I went through college (unfortunately) not getting hookups, laid, nothing. It is really depressing seeing men who are shitty people having girlfriends, getting married, etc. because I know quite a few people who I would say fit that category and still somehow have gotten through those steps.

We're not close - I only see her at family events, but when her baby was born she invited by husband and I in to visit them in the hospital - we brought coffee and chocolate, stayed about half an hour and left. 

I had my daughter about 3 months later. I was very certain that I didn't want people visiting me in the hospital but I invited my dad and sister and my parents in law call in because I knew they really wanted to be there and well, I didn't want to be a jerk. My sister in law travelled to the town where the hospital is with her parents (only about 15 mins from her house) and had coffee at a nearby cafe with my husband and toddler while her parents visited. When they left, my husband told me she wanted to come visit me and the baby. I said I didn't want any more visitors but that we'd see her soon. 

I didn't think of it again. As far as I was concerned, she had a nice coffee with her brother, got to see her parents and that was it - I didn't realize she was expecting a visit. Apparently though, she was super annoyed that I wouldn't allow her up to my ward. I felt bad as I hadn't meant to cause offense so I asked my husband to explain that I hadn't wanted any visitors, that it was a traumatic birth with a major haemorrhage and a retained placenta requiring theatre intervention (I still had a catheter and IV antibiotics at this stage), and it was extremely emotional as my mother recently died and would obviously not be visiting her new granddaughter. The whole time I was assuming that she'd understand that this was a vulnerable time and that I didn't owe anyone a visit.

I didn't have much interaction with her over the past few months but coming up to Christmas our paths are crossing more and she seems so angry at me. I'm constantly getting snide comments, especially about my parenting, and her general tone towards me is barely veiled distain. 

This culminated over the past few days when we told my inlaws that the 2 month old baby and I would be staying at home for Christmas due the risk posed by the especially bad flu season. She took this really poorly, telling me I'm unreasonable, accusing me of really disappointing everyone and being disrespectful to the family.
 
I don't want there to be bad blood, but nor do I want to apologize for not allowing her to see us in the hospital when she hadn't been invited. However, if I had, even for a few minutes, this negative atmosphere may have been avoided.

1po483r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anti_Opus_Dei/comments/1po483r/what_i_knew_about_the_domestic_servants_of_opus/,What I knew about the domestic servants of Opus Dei when I was in,"I will assume readers are familiar with the class of female Opus Dei members initially called domestic servants, now ""assistant numeraries"". Their job was to shop, cook, clean, do laundry etc. in the centres of Opus Dei. I was a numerary living in men's centres in Scotland and England between 1995 and 2004.  All but one of these centres had an ""administration"", composed of domestic servants, supplemented in some centres by paid staff. I did not know which women were in Opus Dei or paid staff. 

**My knowledge of domestic servants**

I never once spoke to a domestic servant. If I saw them, I would not make eye contact. The main mentions of them were as ""our sisters"" or ""the administration"" in talks from fellow numeraries and meditations from priests when we were encouraged to be considerate of them in e.g. keeping our rooms tidy. 

I remember once a Spanish numerary suggesting that I think of what ""our sisters"" had done for me as a way to bat away ""temptations against persevering in my vocation"".  

**What domestic servants did for us numeraries**

At some point in my 9 years in Opus Dei, I was living for a year on weekdays in a house with just one other numerary because of my work location. We did all the chores without problem. In the centre where there were no domestic servants, I laid tables and washed up. However, apart from these times, I was living in houses with an administration, where I never once cooked a meal, shopped for food or household items, lifted a cloth or vacuum cleaner, nor used an iron or washing machine. We had no kitchen on our side of the house, and not even a kettle. 

We literally could not invite a friend for a cup of tea spontaneously or without asking the director's permission. He would then phone through to the administration to order a tray with tea and coffee, immaculately presented.

**""Bad spirit"" to ask questions**

As with absolutely other aspect of Opus Dei's practices, the separation of men and women in Opus Dei was from God because Escriva said so. Escriva was a saint approved and the church had approved Opus Dei. So the way of working was something completely set in stone and no discussion was necessary. 

It was ""bad spirit"" to ask questions about the administration or could indicate ""temptations against purity"". There were no discussions between numeraries about the administration, at least none that I was aware of. And an attempt to initiate such a discussion would have been ""bad spirit"", likely to result in a fraternal correction. 

**Recruitment when young and trafficking**

Looking back, I knew that many domestic servants were young and that the older ones probably joined when young. The majority of numerary priests and numerary directors who I was led by had been recruited between 14.5 and 16. So it was just a basic (and correct) deduction to imagine the same went on on the women's side. Remember that discussing one's vocation in anything except positive terms was not acceptable and when I admitted temptations against vocation in the fraternal chat, I got given direct advice to bat them off spiritually. God had called us from all eternity to Opus Dei and some of us when we were younger. So given that almost all of us were coerced vocations with no inner freedom to consider that coercion, it was unthinkable to imagine that any of the women had been coerced. 

Looking back, I knew that some of the domestic servants who served me were not British. This was unremarkable as on the men's side, I knew numeraries who had been sent from Spain to England as teenagers. Once you said yes to God in Opus Dei as a numerary or domestic servant, you then obeyed. It did not occur to me then that these movements could be illegal trafficking of minors. 

**Drudgery**

Looking back, I knew that domestic servants worked incredibly hard. This was because the standard of cleanliness and catering was exceptionally high - to be honest, stupidly perfectionistic. They served us for lunch and dinner on all weekend days and dinner on weekdays. They laid out breakfast every day. On feast days, they provided aperitifs before dinner. 

When I lived in 8 Orme Court, my bedroom was on the 5th floor and there were no steps. I knew they would have had to lift a vacuum cleaner up and down a lot of steps. I picked up a lot of negative vibes from some priests that I was not doing enough ""apostolate"" i.e. recruitment to justify the immense effort of the domestic servants. I felt guilty then but it is a blessing that I was such a troubled numerary as I did not recruit anyone or f\*\*\* up the lives of other members.  

**Deception in recruitment**

I did not know what I know now about the deception involved in the recruitment of domestic servants in poor Catholic areas e.g. the advertisement of hospitality boarding schools without mention of Opus Dei, and instructions not to tell parents that one had joined Opus Dei. I did not know the extent of the isolation of domestic servants, how rarely they left their house. I did not know the extent of the drudgery though like a hotel guest, I had enough information to deduce this in general without knowing the details. 

It is possible that only a certain proportion of the numerary priests - the older and more senior ones - knew about the level of deception involved in the recruitment of domestic servants. However, they all would have known about the extent of the drudgery. 

**Sworn to secrecy**

The Regional Vicars of each region as well as some very senior numeraries are ""inscritos"", which involves making promises to Opus Dei of secrecy. So I suspect that senior numerary priests who found out later the deception were told to keep quiet for the sake of the institution, which is is a scandal of the highest order. 

There's a lot of Aufarbeitung and ""Truth and Reconciliation Processes"" to be worked through on these issues in the coming years. Numeraries and exes like me who benefited from the blood, sweat and tears of domestic servants need to play a part.",3,1765897539.0,Anti_Opus_Dei,0,1.0,False

Sat you down, poured you a cup, and told you what you've always needed to hear.

COFFEE WITH THE UNIVERSE: THE OFFICIAL GUIDE TO THIS MESSY EXISTENCE is a 35,000-word spiritual self-help book written in the voice of the Universe itself, answering the questions you've had all your life: Who you really are. Why you're here. How to be happy. And how to deal with the other 8 billion confused humans who are figuring it out as they go. It's like the Universe handing you the instruction manual you should have received at birth, all over a cup of coffee.

Think *Conversations with God* by Neale Donald Walsch (1995) for the modern generation, or *The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F\*ck* by Mark Manson (2016) narrated by the cosmos.

Right now, thousands of disjointed voices across TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube claim to speak for the Universe. On TikTok alone, #messagesfromtheuniverse has over 425 million views. Millions scroll daily, longing to hear from something larger than themselves. But no book has captured that voice yet.

We're claiming that voice. And we're converting that viral hunger into a book before anyone else does.

Books like *The Mountain Is You* by Brianna Wiest (2020) and *Don't Believe Everything You Think* by Joseph Nguyen (2022) proved that accessible spiritual wisdom translates into massive sales. But while those books talk *about* the Universe. This one lets the Universe talk to you. It's what millions have been scrolling for, but couldn't find in bookstores. Until now.

I was set to inherit a multi-million-dollar company, until a crisis turned my world upside down. So I wrote myself a letter from the Universe. It worked. That letter became a daily newsletter now reaching 2,300+ subscribers. Before this, I spent over a decade in marketing and sales, moving more than $15 million in products. Today I lead mindfulness and meditation workshops for companies.

This isn't a book launch. It's the start of a brand, and a spiritual book series for the TikTok generation.

A full proposal and sample chapters are available upon request. Thank you for your time and consideration.

This is a video of my first shot that doesn’t look amazing but it tasted 10 times better than the Breville barista pro shots.

I didn’t precisely measure the dose . It was around 16g as I was using the same dose for the barista pro. I had 3d printed the arms up, some mittens. Those fitted correctly. The tamper part I printed however wouldn’t fit on the tamper so not sure what happened.

Anyway I extracted about 40g coffee in 28secs.

I was amazed at how easy it was and the little mess and clean up. The puck came straight out and a small rinse and wipe and that was it.

The parts all feel so solid.

Any tips to improve my shots?

Making me realise with time Keto does not mean restriction or deprivation, just needs creativity.","I just made an absolutely delicious curry. So delicious, in fact, I decided the people of reddit must know about it.

It was pretty basic, I bought a jar of Thai curry paste with 10g carb per 100g, it was the lowest carbs per gram of the curry pastes I could buy.

I bought double cream, chicken stock which I also salted (I take electrolyte pills but think added sodium helps, you learn to interocept, light headedness, mild irritability etc).

I had pre finely chopped cauliflower which I fried in olive oil till nice golden brown as my substitute for rice.

I lightly fried/browned off my chicken, in olive oil.

I added about 2 scoops of the paste which I estimated at 7g carb probably.

I added the double cream and some chicken stock which I then simmered to reduce.

I then poured my  Thai curry on the bed of cauliflower.

I thought it would taste nice, but I was so pleasantly surprised, it was fucking delicious.

Sometimes in cooking things turn out better than you imagined, and this was one of those occasions.

I'm doing keto to lose weight but also, arguably more importantly, I want to keep to it long term for metabolic/serious mental health issues.

This one meal has made me realise, with time, and the means. Keto does not mean any restriction.. And with all the benefits I get with it? It feels like the perceived negatives of it being ""restrictive"" will be history when I learn to expand my keto cooking repertoire.

I'm so happy.

It's made me think sugar is this addictive white powder which when separated from the real taste pallate of foods, doesn't add much to one's life.. but brings inflammation, ups and downs, turbulence, and it's just, for me, better out my life.

The next keto meal I will cook is an almond keto coffee cake :). I'll definitely be repeating my keto curry again too :D!

1po3v38,https://www.reddit.com/r/stepparents/comments/1po3v38/hcbm_now_claiming_she_is_bipolar/,HCBM now claiming she is bipolar,"My husbands ex wife massively fucked up her life. I have posted here before but when my husband finally caught her in her affair with her married neighbor she admitted to cheating with “only” two different men. Over the years, he had uncovered 12 different affairs. Pretty much one for every year they were together. She was pikachu face shocked when he slapped her with divorce papers and lost her ever loving mind when she found out about me. I knew him during their divorce because I had just moved to their small town and at the time was the bartender at the local watering hole where he was drowning his sorrows. So I have seen him through every part of this ordeal and gave him a lot of emotional support throughout the divorce before it turned romantic. I met him probably 6 weeks after he found out about the cheating.

This woman had chased me down in parking lots while screaming in my babies face, told people in our small town I was abusing her children, played the parental alienation card like an expert, tried to defraud my husband for thousands and thousands of dollars. Tried breaking up my marriage, tried pulling my husband away from the NICU after our son was born, threatened to “go after him for every dollar he has” if he didn’t leave me. She finally Got hit with a cease and desist and then suddenly wanted to go get coffee with me to talk things over (this did not happen). She did apologize to me eventually but the apology was “I’m sorry for everything we did to each other”. I have never done nor said a single word to this woman, even while she was chasing me down in a parking lot (I work in a prison I’m used to high conflict and socially inappropriate behavior and not engaging so I am dead serious when I say I have never given her any type of response or done a single thing to this woman).

Parallel parenting only escalated her more, the cease and desist did work as far as harassment and such but after that was sent she started the alienation hardcore. When I tell you this woman has done everything she possibly can to terrorize us, I mean it. I ended up having to get on psych meds because my depression was so bad during the height of this and had to start seeing a therapist for help. Her abuse permeated every aspect of my marriage and life and I nearly left my husband countless times (I probably packed my suitcase 20 times during all this). I lost myself dealing with this and became someone I never thought I could possibly be.

She has now taken to the internet to create a memorial page for her dog, where every page share she gets she will run a mile for. What is this page for? To announce to everyone that she’s bipolar and is raising awareness for mental health. There’s no professional organization she’s working with or attached to this page. It’s just her being fucking weird. Again.

I am not saying she’s outright lying about this new bipolar diagnosis, and maybe my judgement is a little skewed because I am an RN in a prison that houses a large psych population. So the bipolar patients I know have done things like m\*\*der their own children or committed felony arson. I know there are different levels of bipolar and I deal with the extreme behavioral ones. I have also met people in prior jobs who have lived with this that would never dream of doing any of the above or any of what my husbands ex has done.

But this woman, unmedicated, has held the same job for years and managed a clientele, has had the same house for years, lived in the same town her entire life, no criminal record, no substance abuse, and is able to mask as a godly Christian woman who volunteers with children and that mask only slipped with my husband when she got caught after 12 years of cheating. These are not traits I have ever matched up to an unmedicated person living with bipolar. Maybe I’m wrong. My issue is the fact that she can hold complete stability in every aspect of her life, never drop the mask, can lead dual lives with ease, and that doesn’t check out. The ONLY symptom that checks out is impulsiveness (but only when it comes to married men?) as those were her usual target. She herself said in a text message to my husband during their divorce that she enjoyed what she did and got a high from knowing that she was sleeping with someone’s husband and that she enjoyed the thrill of cheating.

It just feels like instead of just going away and letting this fizzle out into old news, she’s trying to cover up her ruined reputation in this small town by taking on a mental illness. It’s like she’s trying to announce to everyone that “it wasn’t ME that cheated on, abused, and terrorized my husband and then his wife. It wasn’t ME that lied to you all about his wife being a child abuser and tried to convince you that your kids weren’t safe at her house. It wasn’t ME that slept with all of your husbands and triggered a divorce in six different marriages. It was the bipolar that made me do it”. And of course she’s garnering sympathy now after all of the abuse she inflicted on us. She’s “stunning and brave” not an abuser anymore.

1po3u9k,https://www.freedomunited.org/news/slavery-convention-remains-crucial/,"100 years later, slavery continues to evolve","Most of us think slavery is history, but it’s still happening today — just in different forms. Instead of chains, it looks like **forced work, huge debts people can never repay, sexual exploitation, and even forced marriage**.

Traffickers don’t always “kidnap” people. Often, they **promise jobs, safety, or a better life**, then trap people with threats, violence, or control. This happens across industries we all depend on — **food, coffee, mining, construction, fashion**, and more.

Technology has made things worse in some ways. People are now recruited online, and **children face serious risks in digital spaces** — grooming, blackmail, and exploitation that is hard to detect.

The impact on survivors is deep — anxiety, trauma, lifelong shame, and loss of freedom. Even when someone escapes, the psychological scars stay.

**Why does it continue ?**

Slavery thrives where people are vulnerable — low wages, discrimination, weak laws, social hierarchies, or migration without protection. Sometimes entire families are born into systems where exploitation is “normal.”

Some businesses look the other way, and **supply chains often hide suffering**. The materials in a phone or the beans in a coffee can come from places where workers have no freedom.

Governments have created laws to stop this, but **enforcement is slow**, systems are underfunded, and survivors don’t get the support they need. Targets like ending child labor by 2025 have already been missed.

**What we can do ?**

Governments and corporations aren't going to change on their own. The movement to end modern slavery needs pressure from citizens and civil society. Just being aware and **questioning the story behind the products we consume** is a first step. Slavery exists partly because **exploiters act — and most of us don’t realize we’re connected to it through everyday choices.**",1,1765896622.0,u_FreedomUnitedHQ,0,1.0,False

Dive Log – Day 1

I told myself I wouldn’t write these down. Superstition, maybe. Or just not wanting proof of our stupidity. But here I am, pen in hand, salt drying in the creases of my fingers. The ink smudges slightly when I pause, though perhaps that’s more my shaking hand than anything else. The ocean smells heavy tonight, even in my cabin, and the air feels damp with the faint, briny scent of the world below. I suppose it’s the sort of thing you only notice when you’re alone and forcing yourself to think.

The idea was mine. No surprise there. I’d read about the place—a submerged city in the Mariana Trench, sunk long before anyone alive could have named it. The story goes that it was discovered by a deep-sea drilling crew who swore they saw towers through the murk, lit faintly from within. No one believed them. And why would they? Nobody wants to admit they saw something that doesn’t fit neatly into a chart or a diagram. Nobody wants to be called a fool in the face of the infinite.

I told Aaron, and like the best friend he’s always been, he agreed. But it wasn’t just because he believed in my wild, obsessive theories—he always does—but because he knew me well enough to understand that I’d never let this go otherwise. I can be stubborn, and sometimes reckless, but I don’t act without reason. There’s a method to my madness, if you can call it that. The ocean has called me all my life, in ways I didn’t understand until much later.

I grew up in a small coastal town, the kind where the waves are your lullaby and the fog rolls in thick enough to make the world seem like a different place entirely. My father was a diver—a commercial diver, mostly, not the romanticized kind you read about in books. He worked the offshore rigs, dragging himself through depths I could barely imagine as a child, always coming home with stories of pressure and darkness, but also strange, fleeting beauty. He never mentioned ghosts or sunken cities. He spoke of things with precision, matter-of-fact, almost clinical, which made my imagination run wild in rebellion.

Aaron, on the other hand, grew up inland. His family was entirely terrestrial: mechanics, accountants, teachers. Yet somehow, when he met me in school, the ocean became as much his fascination as mine. I remember the first time we met—he had an old telescope he’d found in a garage sale, the kind with brass fittings that made it look ancient and important. He’d pointed it at the harbor, tracing ships in their slow, careful journeys, asking questions that made my stomach clench with excitement. We were thirteen, and I knew immediately that I’d found someone who would follow me into the unknown, or at least humor the idea of trying.

There’s something about being drawn to the water, to what lies beneath, that shapes a person. Maybe it’s the weight, the pressure, or the strange silence that comes when you’re submerged deep enough to feel removed from the world entirely. I spent hours as a child sketching maps, drawing cities I imagined below the waves, placing streets and towers in precise, obsessive detail. Sometimes I would stare at the ceiling at night and imagine floating above those cities, looking down at the forgotten lives that might have existed. Of course, I never told anyone. The other kids would have laughed, maybe even called me insane. But Aaron—he understood, or at least pretended to. And that’s all that mattered.

By the time I was sixteen, my fascination had turned into obsession. I began studying oceanography texts, reading every report I could find of undersea anomalies. There were stories of structures that could not have been natural, formations that defied explanation, sonar images that seemed to show walls and streets. Scientists dismissed most of it, calling it pareidolia, wishful thinking. I wanted to believe. I needed to believe. And I could not shake the feeling that someone, somewhere, had glimpsed the truth.

Aaron’s role in all of this was never minor. While I got lost in theoretical possibilities, he kept our feet—or at least one foot—on solid ground. He was practical, the kind of person who would pack extra oxygen tanks, double-check our dive computers, and always argue the merits of caution. I laughed at his prudence, but deep down, I knew I needed it. Without him, my dreams might have drowned in my own recklessness. With him, I had a tether to reality strong enough to pull me back when I floated too far into fantasy.

Our preparation for this expedition has been long and meticulous. Months of research, sourcing equipment, planning logistics, mapping currents, and tides. We didn’t just throw ourselves into the Mariana Trench on a whim; that would have been absurd. This was deliberate, a carefully considered step in a journey I’ve spent my entire life imagining. I can still recall the first time I saw the trench on a map, a jagged scar in the ocean floor. Its enormity terrified me, its silence promised mysteries deeper than anything I’d dared to dream.

And yet, even with all the planning, there is a thrill to the unknown that can’t be tamed. Every checklist ticked, every safety precaution accounted for, I can feel that same pulse of anticipation that first grabbed me as a child staring at the harbor through Aaron’s telescope. It’s the same pulse that drives explorers, dreamers, and fools alike to risk everything for a glimpse beyond the ordinary.

I remember, when I was twelve, finding a book in the town library tucked into a corner so dark it seemed almost ashamed of itself. It was a thick, leather-bound volume, yellowed and smelling faintly of mildew and ink, titled Sunken Realms of the Ancient Deep. The pages were brittle under my fingers, and the diagrams were intricate, impossibly detailed. Towers, plazas, staircases, even what looked like small ships frozen in time. I read it cover to cover, night after night, hiding it under my pillow so that no one would take it away. I wanted to believe in the impossible. I needed to.

Aaron was there when I first tried to explain it. He listened, nodding, but with that skeptical tilt of his head that I’ve grown to love and loathe in equal measure. “You mean, like Atlantis?” he asked, because that was the only story he’d ever heard that sounded even remotely similar. But it wasn’t Atlantis. Atlantis was a fable, a cautionary tale told to children. This, this I was sure of, was somewhere beyond stories, somewhere forgotten. He didn’t mock me then, not like everyone else would have. That silence, that willingness to just let me talk, meant more than any encouragement could have.

I’ve always been meticulous. I can lose myself in small details, memorizing charts, diagrams, and coordinates until they’re etched into my memory like a map tattooed on my brain. Some people call it obsessive. I call it preparation. The way Aaron organizes his gear, cataloging every tool and double-checking every setting, complements it perfectly. I imagine that together we make a strange sort of perfect machine. He keeps us grounded while I reach for the stars—or, in this case, the dark, suffocating depths.

The room where I write this is cluttered with remnants of my obsessions. Charts of tides, sketches of deep-sea creatures, faded photographs of the harbor at different hours of the day. Each photograph captures something fleeting: a gull frozen mid-flight, a splash against the pier, light refracting off the water in an angle I could swear changes from day to day. Aaron sometimes laughs at my hoarding tendencies. “You’re like a collector of ghosts,” he says. I don’t correct him; he’s not entirely wrong. There is a part of me that believes the ocean remembers, that every wave and every current carries memory, and I am trying, desperately, to decode it.

I’ve had mentors, too, people who nudged me toward this path without fully knowing why. One was a retired oceanographer, a man named Carl, who let me spend hours in his study poring over sonar readings, deep-sea photographs, and old expedition journals. He had a way of speaking that made everything seem urgent, as though the ocean were not just water but an entity with secrets it might share—if you asked the right questions. I think he saw in me what I sometimes see in myself: a stubborn refusal to accept the mundane, a hunger for something beyond the ordinary.

I’ve had failures as well. Trips where equipment malfunctioned, dives cut short, ideas dismissed by professors and peers who thought I was naïve. Those failures have built a kind of resilience, a sense of stubbornness so refined that even fear doesn’t stop me. I’m not fearless—far from it. But I understand fear now. I live with it, and I use it.

Aaron, in contrast, has fewer mentors but an unshakable pragmatism that has saved us both more times than I can count. He approaches problems like a chess player, calculating multiple moves ahead, considering contingencies I would never even see. He has a dry sense of humor, one that catches me off guard more than I care to admit, and when he laughs, it has the effect of grounding me in reality just long enough to stop me from floating too far into fantasy.

Our town is small, coastal, sleepy in most ways, but restless when the tide turns. Nights are thick with fog rolling in from the ocean, the smell of salt so heavy it clings to your clothes, your hair, your skin. The harbor is alive with sounds—the creak of wooden boats, the occasional bark of a dog, the soft lapping of water against the piers. I’ve walked these streets hundreds of times, yet I notice things others overlook: the glint of light off wet ropes, the way the tide drags forgotten debris in a slow, inevitable circle, the rhythm of the gulls as they wheel in the early morning. Aaron notices these things too, though he doesn’t always comment. We share an unspoken understanding about observation.

And yet, as much as I cherish this life, it is tethered to the unknown. That pull is inescapable. Every book, every story, every dive I’ve ever attempted has led me here, to this single point in time when preparation meets obsession. When I imagine tomorrow, the thought is not of danger but of revelation. And yet, I will not write about that tomorrow here. Not yet. Today, I am content to linger in these memories, these fragments of a life lived half in the known world and half in the fathoms below.

Dive Log – Day 3

We’ve been running the final checks on the submersible all day. It’s barely big enough for two, and even with the hatch open, it feels like the walls are closing in. Aaron says it feels like a coffin. I tell him that’s fitting. He laughs, but it’s a little forced, the kind of laugh someone makes when they’re trying to hide a spike of fear. I don’t mock him. I’ve felt it too—the creeping awareness of how tiny we are compared to the ocean, how expendable we could be if a single seal fails.

The sub isn’t big. From the outside it looks like a steel pill bug, rounded plates welded over a frame, paint stripped by years of salt and pressure. From the inside, it feels even smaller. Up front, there’s the viewing dome—not glass but a thick acrylic bubble bolted into the hull. It distorts things a little, like looking through that plastic at the top of a McDonald’s playground, but it gives you the illusion of openness even though the rest of the cabin is as tight as a closet. Aaron always calls it “the eye,” like the sub’s one way of looking out into the world. I don’t tell him, but I hate that name. Makes me feel like something out there could be looking in.

The controls are laid out just behind the dome. Two chairs, bolted to the floor, with old canvas straps across the laps—one for the pilot, one for whoever’s unlucky enough to sit next to the pilot. A forest of dials, knobs, and toggle switches are clustered above, with little hand-painted labels. Half of them I don’t understand. There’s a panel of gauges Aaron watches like they’re holy scripture—pressure, ballast, trim, power reserves—and every time I ask what one means, he gives me an explanation that might as well be a bedtime story in another language. Case in point: the other day I pointed at a dial that just said “FLOW REG,” with a needle twitching between green and red, and asked what it did. Aaron said it tells us how well the compensator handles void displacement during cycle transfer. I nodded like I understood. I didn’t. Still don’t. I figure if the needle points to red, that’s bad, and if it points to green, we’re fine. Beyond that, it’s magic.

Behind the chairs, there’s a narrow bench built into the wall, barely big enough for two people to sit shoulder-to-shoulder. It’s where we dump gear—helmets, tanks, sample jars, the camera rigs. Right now, Aaron’s case of sonar buoys is strapped there, and every time we hit a bump it rattles like bones in a tin can. There’s also an emergency locker, painted orange, with a crowbar, medkit, flare pistols, and something that looks like a harpoon gun. Aaron insists it’s a “line launcher,” but I’ve seen enough movies to know a harpoon when I see one.

To the back is the airlock: a small circular chamber with another hatch leading outside. It takes about five minutes to cycle, which feels like an eternity when you’re standing in there with water rising past your neck. I don’t go in unless I have to. The smell of oil and old metal clings to it, and it always feels colder in there than the rest of the sub. There’s also a storage nook built into the floor—a hidden compartment Aaron showed me once. He popped the panel and revealed ration packs, water canisters, and a box of instant coffee. I asked if he’d packed it for emergencies. He said it came with the sub. The coffee expired in 1998. I told him if we ever have to break that open, I’m eating the ration packs and he can have the coffee. He didn’t laugh.

Lighting’s provided by a strip of LEDs along the ceiling, half of which flicker when we descend too quickly. The hum of the circulation fans fills the silence, and every so often there’s a low thunk as the hull shifts under pressure. It’s like being inside a drum someone occasionally taps with a mallet. For comfort, there’s only one addition: a little patch of velcro on the wall where Aaron sticks a photo of his dog, a golden retriever grinning like it’s in on a joke. I’ve stared at that photo so long I swear I know the dog’s name, though Aaron’s never told me. The picture has water damage creeping in from the corner, and I keep waiting for it to curl and fall off, but it’s held so far.

What gets me most about the sub isn’t the size, though. It’s how everything feels secondhand. The walls are scratched. Some bolts are mismatched. There’s a panel near the dome that buzzes like a hornet if you press it. Nothing feels factory-new. It’s all patched, adjusted, repurposed. And somehow, Aaron trusts it with our lives. I guess that’s the thing: Aaron understands every piece of this machine. He knows what lever to pull, what gauge to tap, what sound means we’re fine and what sound means we’re minutes away from imploding. Me? I just write about it. And honestly—that’s fine by me.

Right now, we’re still above water, the sub cradled in its launch rig, rocking gently with the motion of the platform. The hum of the generators and the salty tang of the air remind me that in a few hours, this open hatch will close, and the world outside will be nothing but black water pressing against steel. “Do you ever get claustrophobic in here?” he asks, rubbing at his wrist like he’s trying to shake the feeling off. “Only when you won’t stop humming that awful tune,” I reply. He narrows his eyes. “Awful?” He frowns. “I’ve been told by professionals it’s soothing. Not that you’d understand.” I snort. “You’re right. I’d never appreciate a tune that sounds like a walrus choking on seaweed.”

He laughs, a real laugh this time, and shakes his head. One day, he says, he’s going to make me regret that, and it won’t be pretty. I tell him I’ve got a lifetime of excuses prepared and that he’s not scaring me. We sit like that for a while, the teasing filling the small space more than the hum of the sub’s systems. It’s easy to forget, for a moment, that we’re about to descend into one of the most hostile places on Earth. It’s these moments that remind me why we work so well together—he keeps me grounded, but he also makes it impossible to take fear too seriously.

Aaron eventually leans back against the hatch, arms crossed, and exhales slowly. He admits he keeps thinking about the city, about what’s down there, and that he can’t decide if he’s excited or terrified. I tell him it’s supposed to be both. He shakes his head and says that’s comforting, as always. I remind him he’s got me, like always. His expression softens. He brings up the time we tried diving off the pier as kids, when I got my suit stuck on the ladder and he nearly drowned laughing. I remind him he was just as much at risk. He grins and says he saved me. I admit he did, even if he laughed the whole time. He bumps my shoulder and promises he’ll save me again, even if we’re dangling miles under the surface of the ocean.

The sub feels alive in its own way. The hum of the systems, the faint vibration of the motors, the slight hiss of pressurized compartments—it all reminds me that we are encapsulated, isolated, dangling in a world that doesn’t forgive mistakes. I run my hand along the walls, tracing rivets and seams, as if feeling the solidity will convince me we’re safe. Aaron complains again about how small it feels, like being trapped in a sardine can with all your fears. I call it efficiency. He rolls his eyes. I tease him for checking the oxygen gauges for the third time in five minutes. He admits maybe it’s both of us, but insists he’s being responsible.

We sit in companionable silence while the sea stretches flat and endless outside, sunlight glinting off the surface in sharp contrast to the darkness that will soon swallow us whole. I watch Aaron adjust a gauge with precise, unflinching movements and feel the familiar reassurance of having him beside me. No matter what the depths hold, no matter the pressure or the dark, we face it together, as we always have.

The day passes slowly. Every adjustment feels magnified by anticipation. Even when we aren’t actively working, our minds churn through procedures and contingencies. The air inside still carries the faint tang of salt from our suits, mingling with sterile metal. Tomorrow presses on us heavier than any depth chart. And yet, beneath the fear, a strange calm settles in—a certainty that this is exactly where we are meant to be, as reassuring in its own way as the steel walls of our little coffin.

The checks continue: oxygen scrubbers cycled and logged, ballast measured to micrograms, lights tested through every beam setting, thrusters pulsed in controlled bursts, sonar run and rerun. Some echoes smear strangely. Some vanish. Nothing we can identify. We test redundancy upon redundancy, record every number, investigate every deviation no matter how small. The glowing dust outside the viewport twists unnaturally in the beams, spiraling where no current should be. I note it. Aaron notices it. We say nothing.

By the time the sun sinks and the water darkens, the sub feels heavier somehow, denser with readiness. Every system has been checked multiple times. Every contingency rehearsed. Above the water, the sub waits. Tomorrow, it will descend.

Here are a few things that really helped me get and stay on track. Hopefully this can help someone else.

1. I deleted all social media and my work email from my phone.
   * I don’t need to be that engaged in what is going on in the world or my work email. If it is important, I can either log on to my phone’s web browser or my laptop.
2. At the beginning of each week, I write down all of the things I want to get accomplished that week. Then I highlight the priorities (either through deadlines or how impactful it will be in my work
3. I have 1 cup of coffee in the morning.
   * After I wake up, I sit in silence for about an hour, sometimes I will write things down, but mostly I just daydream about various things. Then I will make myself a cup of coffee and drink it while I’m getting the kids ready. I DO NOT drink more coffee throughout the day. This was one of the hardest things as I was a big coffee drinker, but I found out that after that first cup, I get anxious and can’t stay on task.
4. After lunch I have quiet time.
   * I go for a walk (everyone needs to do this) and afterwords I sit at my desk, eye closed, screen off, and let my mind relax. If it drifts back to work, I redirect it “we’ll deal with that later John, let’s just relax”",2,1765896466.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

He is tall, but never attempted to climb out of his crib because he has used a sleep sack continuously since transitioning from a swaddle.

We began recognizing that he wasn’t settling as easily in the crib and was outgrowing it. We worked with him on using a small pillow and blanket while he was in the crib, and he took to those changes well.

Thanksgiving weekend, we built his big-kid bed and committed to the transition. It was smooth sailing for bed and nap! We couldn’t believe our luck! He loved his planet-patterned bedding and bed tent (plug for IKEA for making toddler dreams come true!).

Our run came to an end this past Saturday. He refused nap on Saturday, fought bedtime on Saturday night, skipped a good nap on Sunday because of a previously-planned theme park trip, fought bedtime again Sunday (but relented quickly 🙏🏻), and really resisted—like all-out fought—bed last night. 

He has slept around 10 hours a night for the last 1.5 years, and naps once per day for 2-3 hours. Bedtime is around 7:30/7:45pm and wake-up is by 6am (we have to get out the door by 7:15am for drop-off/work).

Fellow toddler parents/caregivers: WTF. We have a few working theories:

1. He’s overtired. He is functioning with a sleep deficit of at least 10 hours over the last few days. (We are also functioning with a sleep deficit, but coffee.)
2. The transition from crib-to-bed is confused by his napping in a pack-in-play when he’s at grandma’s on weekdays.
3. He doesn’t use a sleep sack in his big-kid bed, but he uses a sleep sack at grandma’s.
4. He realizes he can open and close his door freely (power!).
5. He is overtired because of 2-4.
6. He is 2.

We’re deep in it right now and would so appreciate any recommendations or resources. We don’t want to go back to using the crib, since that option really won’t be safe for him much longer, and we’ll have to commit to the bed transition again.

Now for that second cup of coffee…

For the majority of the semester I've taken the brunt with cleaning (dishes, clutter, picking up her trash, picking up her dirty plates off the floor), my roommate is really sensitive and has depression so I've tried my best to be understanding and not expect too much. Over time the stress weighed on me because I have a morning job , classes, projects (stem major), and then coming home to a sink full of dishes cans all over the apartment and dishes on the floor. I really don't have any time for myself to relax aside from a nap. My roommate just has classes (usually 1 or 2 a day) and is always in the apartment, she stopped job hunting so no work or applications. We live in an apartment provided by the school so we don't need rent money just groceries. My point is she has a lot of free time and usually never helps around the house. Her mother is also heavily over bearing and that affects me too. Her mother is entitled and actively tell her to take advantage of me. She'll tell her to just use my things like conditioner when she forgot to bring some to school, she didn't ask me while I was in the room just told her to use it. Her mother expects me to share all my food and personal items, but forbids me from using her things or food. Her mother also expected me to wake my roommate up for her morning classes and make sure she was ready in time, and threw a fit over the fact I wouldn't let her daughter use my PC for loans.

It's winter break now and she already left, the thing is she left me with a sink full of dishes and a coffee she made that morning that she decided not to clean up or take home. On top of making the comment of thinking about taking the trash out before she left but then just not doing it. I was frustrated already over the mess and lack of cleaning before leaving and the fact she knew she was leaving for break and didn't clean up after cooking dinner the night before. I did the dishes after the morning she left because I was working all day-night on a final project. The dishes we absolutely disgusting and they also stunk. There was a pan in there full of whatever she used to cook her crab meat (smelled and looked like seafood boil stuff) which by the time I cleaned it has all separated and became crusty and chunky. It looked like genuine vomit. And a bowl with a chunk of canned tuna with mayo, also looked gross cause the bowl was full of water and it stunk. I'm not good with smell or things that look like vomit, so I ended up throwing up 4 times cleaning it up. I was angry and texted her before I was finished with the dishes

3 - rassasi fattan man i feel like its a underrated perfume, i mean yeah in the opening its a bit synthetic but once it dries down oh man the vetiver with the orange note is really addictive in summers, decent performance 6ish hrs many friends said that it smells like a vape, idk why i dont get that😂

If yall want any specific perfume review pls comment ill definately help describing it.

We are lucky we paid attention in shop class and have had plenty of projects to practice on through the years. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn’t do anything different! Even if we’d had more to spend, I think I’d have made the same choices.

We kept all original cabinets. 
We swapped the over the range microwave for a hood vent that actually vents outside. 
We built a countertop microwave under our coffee bar - no $ for drawer unit 
We moved our fridge out of the crowded “work triangle” 
We built custom open shelving. 
We installed butcher block on the island. 
We kept our dated brown granite 
We built a pull out trash bin & pull out spice rack 
We closed in the open space above the uppers to hide the ductwork 
We installed a brick backsplash 
We installed under cabinet lighting 
All soft close doors/drawers 
We added millwork to make the cabinets look more unique and custom 
We painted the honey oak! We used a cabinet grade industrial finish. Not sorry!

Detail:



They're blocked everywhere. But emails are forwarded to my husband (deleted on my account) so they can get hold of me that way if they want.

  
She gave me silent treatment from before I went NC (I arranged to see her, for easy light hearted coffee in cafe with her husband and mine, she at this catch up tried to guilt me into coming to her house on my own, I just ducked the offer - she then didnt reply to an email i sent to her a few weeks later catching up, i went NC - because I had a severe breakdown when her actions over the previous two years - leading to me not seeing her in her house - suddenly hit me)

  
She then got in touch Sept wanting to see me for my birthday - again on my own, despite her knowing I won't see her without my husband (who up until he stood up for me against her she absolutely adored for many many years).

  
I ignored her message.

Phone while eating, podcast while walking, YouTube while cooking. I hadn't been alone with my thoughts in probably 5 years.

The moment silence hit, I'd panic and reach for something - anything - to fill the void.

Then I stumbled across research showing that our brains literally need boredom to function properly. Creative insights, problem-solving, even basic self-awareness - all happen during mental downtime.

So I made myself a deal: 30 days of deliberately seeking boredom.

What I actually did:

Morning coffee with zero input. Just me, coffee, and whatever thoughts showed up. No scrolling, no news, no podcasts.

Walks without headphones. 20 minutes daily of just walking. And thinking. Or not thinking.

Meals as meals. Food and silence. That's it. Absolutely brutal at first.

Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks. No more scrolling on the toilet. Just sitting there like our ancestors did.

5-minute wait rule. Before grabbing my phone when bored, I'd wait 5 minutes and see what happened. Most times the urge passed.

Day 3: I almost quit

My brain felt like it was vibrating. I was anxious, irritable, couldn't focus. Kept reaching for my phone out of pure habit and finding nothing there.

It was like digital withdrawal. My hands literally didn't know what to do. I'd pick up objects just to hold something.

Day 7: The panic subsided

The desperate need for stimulation started fading. I could sit through my coffee without my leg bouncing. Still uncomfortable, but manageable.

Started noticing how often I'd been using distraction to avoid feeling anything. Bored? Phone. Anxious? Phone. Happy? Phone to share it. Sad? Phone to numb it.

I'd been running from myself for years.

Day 11: Something clicked

During my boring walk, I randomly remembered this project I'd abandoned two years ago. Then I started thinking about why I quit. Then I realized I actually wanted to try again.

That's when it hit me - my brain had been too cluttered to access my own thoughts and memories.

All that input had been drowning out my internal voice.

Day 14: The ideas started flowing

I solved a work problem that had been stressing me out for weeks. Just popped into my head while doing dishes in silence.

Then I got an idea for a side project. Then another. Then a solution to a conflict with my brother I'd been avoiding.

It was like my brain had been waiting for permission to think. When I finally gave it space, it went to work on everything I'd been ignoring.

Day 19: I started craving boredom

This was the weirdest part. I actually looked forward to my quiet coffee. The silent walks felt like therapy.

I'd catch myself getting annoyed when someone interrupted my ""nothing time."" Me. The person who couldn't sit still for 30 seconds a month ago.

Day 23: Everything felt richer

Colors seemed brighter. Food tasted better because I was actually paying attention to it. Conversations went deeper because I was fully present instead of half-listening while thinking about my phone.

I watched my kid play for 15 minutes without documenting it. Just watched. And actually remembered it better than the hundred moments I'd filmed and forgot about.

Day 28: I remembered who I was

Turns out I have opinions that aren't shaped by whatever I scrolled past that morning. Preferences that are actually mine. Ideas that came from me, not from consuming someone else's content.

I'd been outsourcing my personality to algorithms for so long I forgot I had one.

What actually changed:

My attention span came back. Finished three books that month. Me. The guy who hadn't finished one in two years.

Sleep improved massively. Fell asleep by 11pm naturally instead of scrolling until 2am. Woke up actually rested.

Anxiety dropped by half. That constant background hum of ""I should be doing something"" disappeared. I could just exist without guilt.

Creativity exploded. Had more ideas in 30 days than I'd had in the previous year. Not from consuming more content - from giving my brain space to connect dots.

Relationships got deeper. When you're fully present with people, they actually open up. Friends started coming to me with real problems instead of surface chat.

I became interesting to myself again. My own thoughts were worth exploring. My own company became enjoyable instead of something to escape.

Try this today:

Eat one meal without any entertainment. No phone, no TV, no book. Just you and your food.

See what thoughts show up. Don't judge them. Don't push them away. Just notice.

That's it. One meal. 15 minutes of your life.

1po3bih,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1po3bih/rf_wednesday_morning/,[RF] Wednesday morning,"It's 5 am, and my alarm just rang.

I would've hit snooze, but I need to get going. *I don't have time*. Ugh. I kicked my blanket and dragged myself out of the bed. *Fuck, it's just Wednesday.* Wednesday is the worst day of the week. It feels like you've already done a week's worth of work, yet the weekend is still 2 days ahead. Before, I used to give myself a pep talk right after waking up—it kind of gets me through Wednesdays, or you know, every day of the week.

But today is particularly harder. I can't even bring myself to do my dumb stupid pep talk, let alone carry myself to stand up. I mean, I did manage to get out of my bed, but I'm now sprawled on the floor. I really like lying on the floor. It's soothing. There's something about the cold floor that makes me feel safe, despite me needing a jacket once the temperature drops to 24°C.

*Okay. That's enough.* I push myself up, well I tried to. But failed. I just don't have the capacity to become a person right now. Unfortunately, I have no other choice. So I crawled, dragging my whole body across the room, trying to steal a couple of seconds of rest in between my bouts of attempting to get up and get going.

A few more grunts, drag and push, finally, I reached my kitchen. The whole thing felt like forever, even though I live in an apartment, where the kitchen, dining, living and bedroom are all a few steps away. I mean, who am I kidding. They're not just steps away, they're... Well, my TV is on top of the fridge, there's a chair somewhere, I think. I can't remember where it was. My stove, well if you would call it a stove, is in the middle of the room. I can't seem to find a place for it somehow.

*There's my chair.*

It's buried under a pile of clothes—clean ones, I think. Or maybe dirty. Does it matter? The whole place looks like a tornado hit it, except tornadoes are quick and decisive. This mess has been accumulating for weeks, maybe months. Dishes stacked in precarious towers, takeout containers forming their own ecosystem on the counter. The smell is... well, I've gotten used to it. That's probably not a good sign.

The walls are closing in, painted that ugly beige color that screams ""temporary housing"" even though I've been here for three years. Three years of telling myself this was just until I got back on my feet. The single window is covered with a bedsheet because I never bothered to buy curtains. Why would I? I barely look outside anymore.

I need coffee. Or something that resembles coffee. The machine is somewhere under the debris of my former life.

*Wait.*

On the windowsill, barely visible through the makeshift curtain, there are picture frames. Dust-covered and forgotten, but still there. When did I last look at them? I crawl over, each movement a negotiation with my body.

The first frame: me in a cap and gown, Dean's List certificate in hand, surrounded by proud family. I was glowing. Actually *glowing*. I remember that day—how I felt like I could conquer the world, how everyone kept saying I was destined for great things. ""Valedictorian,"" the inscription reads. That girl looks like a stranger now.

Second frame: me in a crisp business suit, shaking hands with some executive at my first job. Employee of the Month, three months running. I was unstoppable then, working sixteen-hour days and loving every minute of it. My boss said I was the most promising hire they'd had in years. That promotion was supposed to be a stepping stone to bigger things.

Third frame: me at some work party, surrounded by colleagues, everyone laughing at something I'd said. I was the one they came to for advice, the one who organized team events, the one who made everything better just by being there. ""Natural leader,"" they called me.

Fourth frame: me presenting to a room full of suits, pointing at graphs and charts with the confidence of someone who knew exactly what she was talking about. That project saved the company millions. *Millions.* I used to be the person who solved impossible problems before breakfast.

I pick up the last frame with shaking hands. It's me receiving some award—Innovation in Business Excellence or something like that. I'm smiling so wide it looks like it might split my face in half. The woman in that photo believed she was invincible.

*Damn, I was good.*

The words come out as a whisper, but they feel like a shout in the silence of my apartment.

*I was good. I was good. I was good.*

Not past tense. Not *was*. *Am*. I am good. I just... wandered. Got lost somewhere along the way. But not so lost that I can't find my way back. The path is still there, maybe covered with weeds and debris, but still there.

I set the frames down carefully and push myself up. This time, I actually make it to my feet. My legs shake, but they hold. I look around the apartment with new eyes—not at the mess, but at the potential. This isn't where my story ends. This is just a really shitty chapter.

I gather my things: laptop bag, keys, the semblance of professional attire I can cobble together. Each item feels heavier than it should, but I manage. I'm ready. For the first time in months, I'm actually ready to face the world.

I reach for the door handle and turn it.

The hallway beyond is empty. Completely empty. No carpet, no other doors, no elevator at the end. Just concrete walls stretching into darkness. A single flickering bulb hangs from a wire, casting eerie shadows that dance like ghosts.

*What the hell?*

I step back inside and close the door, heart hammering. This isn't right. This isn't how it's supposed to be. I live on the fourth floor of a normal apartment building. There should be Mrs. Chen next door with her yapping dog, and the college kids across the hall with their loud music.

I open the door again.

Still nothing. Just that endless concrete corridor that seems to breathe with malevolent life.

That's when I remember. The accident. The hospital. The doctor's gentle voice explaining about traumatic brain injuries, about how sometimes the mind creates elaborate coping mechanisms to deal with trauma. How sometimes people construct entire realities to avoid facing what they can't handle.

I look down at my legs—legs that haven't moved in eight months. Legs that never will again.

The apartment, the job I'm getting ready for, the struggle to be a person—it's all here, in this bed, in this room that smells like antiseptic and false hope. The woman in those picture frames is real. But she's not coming back.

*I was good,* I whisper to the empty room. *I was good. I was good.*

But good doesn't matter when your world ends on a Tuesday afternoon, when a drunk driver runs a red light, when everything you were becomes something you can only dream about being again.

The alarm is still ringing.

It always is.

1po3big,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1po3big/grinder_upgrade_750/,Grinder upgrade [$750],"Have been using the Baratza Sette 30 for a while now. Was initially only drinking filtered coffee but when I bought my Lelit Victoria, I added the Sette 270 adjustment assembly. It’s been great but have always been annoyed by a couple things:

1) sounds like a jet engine

2) granted, I drink more drip than espresso, but it’s super annoying to dose for espresso. Just not built for it and it gets messy and not as mindless as I’d like. I’d probably drink more espresso during the week if it wasn’t such a pain to go back and forth. 

Anyway, I’m looking to upgrade to something that is quieter, has less of a footprint (maybe more aesthetically pleasing), and hopefully is great for both drip and espresso dosing without much of a pain to go back and forth. 

Does such a grinder exist? Would I be better off keeping the Baratza for drip and get something specifically for espresso?

Also, as an FYI, I use a moccamaster for drip coffee. 

Thank you in advance. ",1,1765895335.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1po350h,https://www.reddit.com/r/melbournesocialclub/comments/1po350h/hey_melbourne/,Hey Melbourne,"Hey Melbourne 👋

I’m a 22-year-old guy (turning 22 tomorrow – 17/12 🎂), recently based in Melbourne and honestly just here to meet people and make some real connections.

I moved here just after COVID from Auckland, NZ, and pretty much went straight into work mode. I work as a financial analyst at a Chinese bank. To be real, I never really made friends there — not out of disrespect, but I already see my coworkers enough at work, and half the time I don’t even understand what’s being said anyway 😅. Work is work.

Background-wise, I’m a bit of a mix: half Kuwaiti / Middle Eastern, mum’s Swedish — so yeah, interesting combo.

Outside of work… there isn’t much of a social life, and it’s starting to feel lonely. I’ve always struggled to make friends, and I’ve usually connected better with people a bit older than me (though I’m open to all ages). I want to actually live — do fun stuff like hiking, road trips, concerts, Melbourne Cup, learning footy, even checking out a nude beach (no judgement, just curiosity and good vibes).

The honest part: I get weird anxiety doing things alone. I’ve never gone to a restaurant by myself, and big events solo just feel awkward to me. I want to do these things — I just don’t want to do them alone.

I’m pretty laid-back, no judgement, just trying to live life like it could be my last and spread positivity where I can.
