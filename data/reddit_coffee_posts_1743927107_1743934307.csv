1jsquzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1jsquzr/philips_lattego_5400_4_years_experience/,"Philips LatteGo 5400, 4 years experience","I want to share my experience with Philips LatteGo 5400. I like this coffee machine, and it is still going strong after 10 thousand coffees are made. Few things I would like to point out, which might make your experience is not as enjoyable if you are not handy:

* Initially, the coffee produced is not very strong and watery. Need to wait a bit and it will become better.
* After a year the ground tray sensor started misbehaving. I stuck something under the tray, so the ground container became higher a bit, and now works well.
* After 2 years had to change the O-rings on the valve (5 euros)
* After 4 years I changed the whole valve (15 euros)
* It was not grinding fine enough after 3 years, even in the finest setting, had to remove the bean hopper and adjust the grinder a little bit manually.
* After 4 years also replaced the milk container/frother with one from Amazon, which works like new, no more weird sounds during milk drink-making (35 euros) 
* Put the tray and discarded grounds container in the dishwasher every week
* Do a deep clean and greasing of the brewing group when the filter is on 50% and after replacing the filter. Run descaling the same day as well.

Once this coffee machine gives up totally will look into non-Philips/Saeco machines, just for a change, but as long as this one is alive and has relatively cheap and available spare parts - I am all set.",1,1743934146.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1jsquio,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1jsquio/what_am_i_missing/,What am I missing?,"I began this journey 10 weeks ago. I started the first 2 weeks micro-dosing (because I was scared honestly). My BG usually doesn’t get over 120 on a heavy carb day, so I was a little apprehensive. BG wise, I usually stay under 95 mg/dL. 3rd week I started the 2.5mg. I stayed on that for 3 weeks then went up to 5mg- providers orders. 

Last night was shot 10. Still at 5mg. I’m down 7lbs total. SW: 213 -> CW: 206.  GW: 155
5’ 4.5” female, mid 30’s
No change in how anything fits or mirror difference. 
However, I DO feel less bloated a lot of times! 

I have very little appetite. I have to force myself to eat when I remember or when I really start feeling like crap. Before I started I would forget to eat then binge. #ADHD is so fun! 🤨 
I’m exhausted all the time. 
I try to meal prep/ bring healthy quick snacks. I know I don’t drink enough water some days- but I’m working on it!

Maybe I should add, I’m a newer nightshift RN (graduated 6 months ago). Sometimes I don’t get a lunch or to sit unless it’s after handoff report and I’m catching up on charting before I can leave. My marriage is rocky (sTrEsS). Partially due to my husband being a workaholic with no other real priorities. He started a new job in management 3ish months before I graduated/started working at the hospital, so he’s still “trying to settle” so-to-speak too. 

Anyway. I have protein drinks that I gulp down to supplement. I’ve decreased my energy drink/coffee consumption to 1 per night, no more candy during my shifts or the 1-2 regular cokes per night for quick hits. I do electrolyte packets and take vitamins/collagen/greens to help fill in gaps. I’m constantly on my feet at work hitting all my rings (apple fitness) and I walk whenever I’m off. Although, tbh, most of the time I’m so exhausted I sleep as much as I can. #MomLife

My schedule goes: Sleep from 10am - 2:30pm, go pick up the kids from different schools, home by 3:45pm, help start homework/finish dinner/pack my lunch, get dressed & leave by 5:50 when husband arrives. Shift starts at 6:30pm. I usually leave work between 7:15am - 9am depending on the night/catch up required. Repeat. I do this 3-5 nights a week, depending on the week. 

I think I just answered my own question. My provider said it was “odd” that I’ve not lost more but doesn’t actually seem concerned. And I understand slow and steady wins the race. 
So maybe I’ll ask this... 
Night-shifters who are the main parents and total-household-chore doers, I need all the tips!

Tldr; My schedule sucks as a newer nightshift RN and main parent. Lost 7lbs in 10 weeks. I feel like I’m missing something and I need a real adults help to navigate this journey. ",1,1743934085.0,tirzepatidecompound,0,1.0,False

“做自己”是需要练习的。我也还在练习中。我也遇到了很多失败。但想要穿越人生中的困难和无奈，我们必须在能按自己的意思来的时候按照自己的意思去生活。

1jsqoqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/amipregnant/comments/1jsqoqa/pregnancy_symptoms/,Pregnancy symptoms,"24F. I've been having pregnancy symptoms for the last month and a half. We're talking extreme bloating in the lower abdomen which definitely gets worse with food and drinks (but no matter what I eat or how much of it, meaning I get incredibly bloated also if I drink some coffee and milk for breakfast). The bloating can subside a bit during the day (sometimes when I go to the bathroom, sometimes randomly, especially if it's been a bit since the last time I ate something), but it almost never fully goes away (I think it happened twice in the last 40 days), so even in the morning there's bloating (although a little less than before going to bed). I'm so constipated (which never happened to me before). 

I also have urinary urgency and need to go pee more often. This symptom seemed to get better but then came back. 

I'm also experiencing nipple itching (which in the last week has become worse and I also get sharp shooting pains and discomfort in my nipple).

Now, I'm on the pill (and I have been having spotting as a side effect for the last year). I sometimes forget to take the pill on time, so if I usually take it before bed, I'll take it in the morning (7-8 hours late), and this can happen once or twice a month. I had every withdrawal bleeding as expected (always came on the right day), even though the last two (and especially the last one) were less abundant (I changed my pad twice on the second day and a single pad lasted the whole third day). Mind that I've never had the need to change my pad more than three times a day (morning, mid-day, evening), even with my normal period. 

I tested twice (once on the 10th of March and once on the 15th) and the tests were negative. I'll also add that I took the first one while I was taking biotin 400 mcg (and I took it after holding urine for 6 hours, right after having taken the supplement). For the second one I had interrupted the biotin, I took it in the evening right before bed and the urine was little and very diluted, but the control line was there and normal.

The last time I had sex before these tests was on the 28th of February (so 10 and 15 days before the tests), but by then I was already experiencing symptoms (they started around 10 days before that). We always used the withdrawal method in addition to the pill. 

I'll have an ultrasound next week, but in the meantime, how much should I prepare myself to the possibility of pregnancy? ",1,1743933405.0,amipregnant,3,1.0,False

Where Do I Go From Here?,"I (23F) have been talking to a temporary coworker (24M) for about a month. When I first met him, he introduced himself then mentioned he’d be at my work for a month then he was leaving. Ok. Cool. As time went on, I started to really like him. For context, I’m a bartender, and he’s been working in the kitchen, so we see each other on occasion, but not super frequently throughout the shift. Still, I found ways to go back there, such as offering extra hands to run food or checking to see if the kitchen needs anything (they get a free coffee or redbull every shift)

I ran into him at Taco Bell after work one day, and he bought me a rose from a street vendor. I texted him that night and thanked him for the rose, and we’ve been texting since then. 

I make empanadas for my coworkers once a month, so he came by my place and helped me make them to see how I do them, because he wanted to learn how to fold empanadas, because he just loves food. After that, he kissed me, and told me I’m beautiful. He said I’m so cool and pretty that it makes him nervous. 

Since then, our interactions have been mostly at work. We still text, but mostly if I initiate the conversation, but once I do it’s good convo. We wait for each other to get out of work, and talk in the parking garage too. He always kisses me goodbye, and he’s gotten more and more brave about it. He also told his bosses about me, because he’s only temporarily there since he’s going to be the kitchen manager at our new location, about 20 minutes away from me. He told me he tells them everything, as they brought him over from his old job, and they’re training him for his new position, and we work in the same company so he wanted to make sure everything was “above board,” in his own words. 

Anyways, I’ve mentioned making plans together, but he’s always completely ignored the comment. I really don’t think he’s a fuckboy type, as he’s super awkward and shy, and I think it’s because he’s genuinely busy with work, since he’s getting ready to manage his own place. I guess my question is how to approach the subject of “what’s next?” without scaring him off. He seems to really like me, and he goes out of his way to greet me every shift. He also texts me throughout my shifts to see how I’m doing, and he even made me some food the other day because he noted I didn’t put in my staff meal. 

I did send him a text earlier asking him if he’ll still talk to me after he moves onto his new job in about two weeks (the opening of the new place got delayed). He hasn’t answered since it was a bit after we said goodnight, but I’m just wondering how to move forward in this without seeming desperate or scaring him away.

I’m nervous as my partner is such a beautiful speaker. I have tried to write from my heart and reflect out playful personalities but want to ensure it is still heartfelt and loving. 

“Lucy, I have loved you since I was sixteen. I remember being so nervous to tell you how I much I liked you as you were and still are the coolest person I’ve ever met. Everyday I am so thankful that I did as I cannot imagine my life without you. 

I love how you are always singing and dancing when doing mundane tasks. I love how when you see two cute things together and comment, “that’s me and you.” How you can walk into any room and fill it with an aura of joy. That you confidently meet and talk to any person, leaving them feeling more confident about themselves. You are make ordinary days feel so special. You’re the reason I drink teas every night, why I watch survivor and eat Maccas breakfast. Every time I look at you I realise how blessed I am to have you in my life and I am excited as we continue to spend our lives together. 

I promise to always be patient and helpful when you misplace things. To make you a coffee every morning and a tea every night. To grow old with you without loosing our silliness. I promise to never take you for granted. I promise every single day to make you feel as understood and loved as you make me feel.

You are my best friend and I love you”",2,1743933071.0,weddingplanning,0,1.0,False
1jsqlse,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutoImmuneProtocol/comments/1jsqlse/implementing_modified_aip_slowly_meal_prep_frozen/,"Implementing (modified) AIP slowly, meal prep, frozen meals + 1st week on mAIP - my experience","Hi All! I wanted to share my experience with starting modified AIP elimination phase the slow way. I chose to do it gradually, because going cold turkey would definitely be too much for me to handle, as food is my stim and my comfort amongst being my fuel (and sometimes happiness).

So the way I did it and it may be early to tell after 3 weeks (1 week on full elimination), but so far so good, I've failed other restrictions before in days.

1. my biggest fear was cutting out sugar: I switched to honey/coconut sugar 4 weeks ago and added fruit (raw and dried) back in my diet, then started to lower my sugar intake. Right now I eat around 1-2 tablespoons of sugar every day. I may be able to lower it, but I'm feeling okay with it right now.
2. then I eliminated milk by switching to coconut milk (I only drink milk with my coffee) and eliminated eggs (I ate one egg each morning)
3. (I have never been into seeds/nuts, so that was easy to eliminate) then I eliminated gluten/grains by gradually eating less of them and started looking up fun (modified) AIP recipes so I can be (somewhat) excited for the elimination phase
4. I saved my favourite recipes, tried a few and put together a smaller list as a meal plan for April
5. I've bought the ingredients last Sunday

This Monday/Tuesday I've meal prepped, as I've figured it would be easiest to go on if I have pre-prepped/pre-made meals to reach for + AIP snacks.

For snacks, I have: dried fruit without added sugar, raw fruit, coconut-dried mango cubes (I can share the link, it should be available in Europe), home made preserves without added sugar, fruit juice in moderation or watered down. I make a snack plate for myself to snack on all day with fruits and sometimes my frozen cookies/muffins.

Amazing snack: coconut yoghurt with ""chocolate"" shell! I've found that if I mix melted coconut oil with carob/cocoa powder, drizzle it on top of yoghurt, put it in the fridge, it hardens and the shell can be broken with a spoon. I also put some cut up fruit or sugarfree preserves in the yoghurt before adding the shell on top. It is so good!

Substitutes or ingredients to add to eat whenever or to add to anything: balsamic vinegar, coconut aminos, tamarind, salad mix, canned tuna/sardines/herring, coconut yoghurt (flours/starches: coconut, tigernut, cassava, tapioca, arrowroot - I don't have plantain widely available in my country)

For meals, I've prepped the following:

* coconut chicken curry: cooked fully, frozen in portions
* lemon honey air fryer wings: frozen raw, in marinade
* philly ""cheese""steak: meat cooked fully, frozen
* maple breakfast sausage: frozen raw, in ""links""
* sweet and sour meatballs: frozen raw, in balls
* sweet potato chicken poppers: frozen raw, in nuggets
* air fryer meatloaf: frozen raw, formed
* blueberry crumble: frozen raw, in portions
* cinnamon swirl muffins, apple cinnamon muffins and banana coconut cookies: frozen baked
* apricot protein balls: frozen in balls

On April meal plan and could not prep them to freeze:

* sage pulled pork
* peach glazed chicken
* ""gyros"" wrap
* arroz con pollo
* duck breasts with cherries
* roasted veggie and salmon bowl
* quinoa porridge with coconut milk (I also added apple sauce and fruit on top)
* sides: warm cabbage and apple salad, lemon honey roasted carrots, umami kale, roasted root vegetables, cassa flour tortillas
* desserts: banana foster ice cream, banana pancakes, apple cinnamon cookies, crepes, apple fritters, pina colada candies, pumpkin latte

I can share all recipes of course, I've found them all over the internet on AIP sites.

The one meal I've struggled with the most is breakfast. Right now it's too early to tell, but I'm eating canned fish or breakfast sausage with vegetables, cold cuts wrapped in lettuce with fruit, quinoa porridge with my decaf coffee and it hits the spot

Maybe this is helpful for some :))

It is 6/04/2025 (AUS dates), and it is 5:30 a.m. I woke up to my alarm blaring at me. I turned it off, stretching before I opened my eyes. I sit up for a few seconds before I stand up and stretch a bit more with a yawn.

I went into the bathroom, I washed my face, then I brushed my teeth, I then did my basic make-up, aka eye-liner and mascara, I brushed my hair and I put it into a high pony.

I then get dressed into my black sleeveless crop top, my high-rise cargo pants, my black combat boots, a black cap and my motorbike skull mask...

I walked out of my room and I went to the mess hall to get something to eat, my hands in my pockets the whole way there.

When I got there I saw Ghost, Soap and Price at their table, and when Soap saw me he waved I nodded to let him know I saw him, then I grabbed something to eat which is French toast a cup of cup up fruit and a cup of apple juice because I'm allergic to orange anything, of course not the colour the fruit.

I walked over to Ghost, Soap and Price and when I got there I said ""morning"" Soap patted the chair beside him while saying ""morning, Lass"", Ghost nods and Price smiles while asking ""how did you sleep?"" ""my sleep was good, how did you all sleep?"" I asked, ""That's good to hear, mine was good too,"" Price said.

I started to eat at this point which means that I pulled up my mask a bit it was a tight fitted one with a lot of stretch so it basically stayed under my nose ""Good"" Ghost simply said while taking a sip of his coffee ""I'm too, Lass"" Soap said I nodded.

I took a sip of my apple juice, and Soap was going to say something funny, but Price stopped him before he could and it looked like something in his brain worked again, and he nodded basically saying he won't.

""Where's Gaz?"" I asked, ""Gaz is on a mission with König"" Price said, ""okay then"" I said simply Price and Ghost has black coffees, Soap has a light brown coffee and all of them are eating eggs and bacon.

""Is it your off day today, Skyler?"" Ghost asked, I nodded, ""yeah, it is"", I said after I took a mouthful of French toast ""It's ours too,"" Price said. I nodded, ""Maybe we can do something together if no one has plans"", Soap said.

I nodded, liking the idea a bit. Ghost did the same as me ""That sounds like a good idea, but what would we all do?"" Price asked, now thinking I was thinking as well, and after a few minutes, I thought of something.",1,1743932668.0,writers,2,1.0,False

I also worry I am contributing to businesses being open on Sunday and perhaps encouraging those businesses to continue operating on Sundays.

* Be able to make milk-based drinks like lattes
* Have a built-in grinder for fresh coffee
* Be easy to operate
* Require low maintenance, if possible

I return from holiday, drop him a message and he's ignored it (3+ days). I did update a picture on my profile (not the main one though) and now he has too. Ofc could just be a coincidence, he's lost interest and is focusing on other matches.

I just bought a small Pure Evoke Spot for the kitchen. It plays music from the DAB+ very fine, but when I connect my Spotify music to it, that sounds horrible. Well, maybe not horrible, but I used to have a Tangent Fjord Dock hanging there, a large black cube that has stereo speakers to the side, which gave a great spread of the sound to the room, while the Pure is too directional.  
I swear my music sounded better on the Tangent. Much much better! Well to noone's surprise, perhaps, but what puzzles me is how radio plays so well on the Pure? Do they do something to the sound profile? and what?

We are painting the walls, so the tangent comes back up, but I will miss the features of the Pure. I would love to find a bluetooth/internet/DAB+ player to connect to the Tangent.

However, what I came here for, was to ask if anyone can explain to me how come DAB+ radio can sound so much better than ordinary library music. Even with the same tracks!?

In January, it reported a fourth straight quarterly drop in global same-store sales after attracting fewer customers in the US and China, its second-largest market, where it is being undercut by rivals such as Luckin Coffee.""

Recently the quality of customers service in Indian Starbucks has been declining. With overcharging, and slow service. To temporarily boost sales by overcharging customers, whether conscious or unconscious, corporate strategy or individual mistake, is only going to lead to complaints and declining sales in the mid to long term.

Please help,"Writing this in tears at 4am as my 13w old has woken every 60-90 min for the last several weeks. She is EBF, born on time with no issues, gaining weight great (70th percentile), happy and not fussy during the day. She’s not sick and she seems to be making good developmental progress. I track in the Huckleberry and we keep to around 75-90 min wake windows. She nurses great and I nurse on demand. I always thought she was an above average sleeper because she would sleep in the bassinet pretty well and we never really had to resort to cosleeping or shifts. We bring her to bed around 5am but that’s just because we like the cuddles and it stretches out the last sleep window.

I guess I just thought that she would be the type to naturally go longer stretches by now since we don’t have other sleep issues. I see others talk about their 3m old sleeping 6-8 hour stretches. Her first sleep stretch is usually close to 3 hrs, and then the rest of the night is 60-90 min. She’s slept 4+ hour stretches maybe 5 times total but it’s always after I’ve had a couple glasses of wine earlier in the day. We’ve moved her did switch her to one arm out of swaddle a few weeks ago, but I don’t even know if that is really the main issue.

We’ve moved her to the crib where it’s dark, sound machine, 70 degrees, heating pad trick. We have a calming bedtime routine. I only drink one cup of coffee per day. I’ve done like everything I’ve read in a Reddit post. I want to start ST her with Ferber in a few weeks because I’m starting to dread these evenings.

I took zepbound about for about three weeks. I started very small. On March 20th I went up to .5 and three days later my BP skyrocketed to 177/110. The next day it was around 140/88.   I have mostly felt better since but admittedly didn’t check my BP daily. 

I was flummoxed as to why my BP would suddenly be so high. I’m 49m and I’ve never had BP issues. In searching for an answer I found a few posts here were for some few people the side effect is a drastic increase in Blood Pressure. Possibly due to how zepbound affects the SNS. 

I am aware that Zepbound lowers BP for many people. This post is not for you. 

I’ve read that Zepbound stays in your system for 30 days. I have felt fine the last two weeks. My caffeine intake was initially high the last two days and I had alcohol on Friday. This may sound dumb but I was feeling fine until I saw a scary tense movie with my wife and I felt my BP skyrocket again yesterday while watching the movie.  Took my BP it was 177/100. 

I attribute this to me having a sensitivity to Zepbound particularly with my SNS. I’m not a big drinker; I drink maybe one glass of wine a month and my coffee is one cup per day (two extra cafe lattes over the last couple of days on top of that). Before this weekend, my diet has been very clean the last month. Focused on protein macros and eating very little processed food. 

As Zepbound stays in system for 30 days, I’m hopeful my SNS will revert back to normal in another 15 days. I’m also gonna stop alcohol completely and reduce my caffeine to half a cup, around 45mg caffeine daily. 

My question is specifically for this whose BP was raised on Zepbound and then stopped taking it. Did your BP ever go back to normal after you stopped taking it?

Thank you for your time. I’m hopeful to get a dialogue going so that others who have this rare side effect can get some information too ",2,1743932059.0,Zepbound,2,1.0,False

I want to express that masculine, grounded energy that makes a woman think “Damn… this guy could really take charge, satisfy me, and make me feel wanted.” Not in a pushy way — but in a way that creates tension and chemistry, where she starts thinking about getting closer, making a move, or even kissing me.

I’m trying to figure out how to build that subtle intimacy — the looks, the body language, the way I speak — that says I’m into her, I’m capable, and I know what I want. But without crossing any lines or making things uncomfortable.

Has anyone here learned how to walk that line between friendly and flirtatiously masculine? How do you spark that deeper attraction while still being respectful?

I made a post about how bored I was and hit it off with some of the characters in my scenario under the comments of my post, so we arranged a coffee date at a local coffee shop (trying to be polyamorous). They both agreed to go, but when I actually scheduled the activity, one of them declined and said something about the other person involved.

Both of them seemed on board initially and didn’t complain about each other, but suddenly one declined because of the other person involved. I’m so confused rn. However, when I accidentally hit “start activity” a few minutes ago, it said that both of them showed up to the date, even though only one person actually accepted the invite in-game. This probably has to do with the description I wrote for the activity since I mentioned both of them in it, but still.

I scheduled this date so I could increase my relationships with them, but now I’m scared that the opposite might happen LMAO (like getting jealous or whatever idk 💔). Anyways, my question is simple: How do I get characters to accept my activities consistently? Since we can’t delete activities yet, I’m kinda fawked if they don’t, even though it’s technically realistic. However, in this case, it literally doesn’t make sense.

So, I have two hybrid repeating crossbows based on the Slinghammer. The first holds eight 7.5-inch adder bolts that it shoots at around 150fps with no problem. I've had to epoxy the heads on, but otherwise, no problems at all.

https://preview.redd.it/7dfnoht5n6te1.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2cd7b28b36dade39cb522e5171603ebc1e8ebd05

The second takes the cheaper and smaller 6.3- or 6.5-inch bolt in a 20-shot magazine. 

Because of what these are, I shoot, like, \*a lot\*. I'm generally  by the kettle at the far end of my my kitchen, through the back door, into a target affixed to my back gate - a distance of around 50 feet.

The chronograph clocks the Anglo Arms aluminium and plastic bolts at around 135 fps, and the cheaper bolts with full plastic bodies and metal head, at a little north of 150 fps

As you can see, I have an issue with the bolts becoming damaged. For reference, they're going through a biscuit tin stuffed with foam, them 3-4 inches of play mat, a folded yoga mat, and slamming into an 18mm board at the back.

The Anglo Arms bolts tend to snap the fins off (not always though), while the cheapo bolts very occasionally snap the shaft, but most of the time the tips take damage and bend when hitting the back board.

The 7.5-inch Adder bolts have none of these problems, but a 20-shot mag with those would be ridiculous, and not suitable for using while I wait for the coffee to brew.

What are you guys using for your smaller pistol bolts? How are they faring? Any recommendations for for solid, durable, 6.3- to 6.5"" bolts?

🃏 **Cards Pulled**: Judgment (Reversed) & Four of Pentacles (Reversed)

# 🌙 A Moment from Today:

I spent most of the afternoon procrastinating on something I knew I had to do—taxes. Every year, I tell myself I won’t wait until the last minute, and every year, I still end up staring at a mess of numbers, receipts, and forms, regretting my life choices. I had everything I needed to get started, but for some reason, I kept finding other things to do instead. Cleaned my desk, made coffee, watched a couple of YouTube videos, and somehow convinced myself that organizing my bookshelf was a priority.

Eventually, I forced myself to sit down and at least *look* at the tax forms. The second I did, I felt this weird wave of guilt. Like I had been avoiding more than just paperwork—maybe it was the weight of responsibility itself.

# 🔮 Tarot Reflection:

Judgment (Reversed) is all about avoiding a wake-up call, resisting self-reflection, or refusing to make a necessary decision. And yeah… that hits hard. I knew I needed to get my taxes done, but I kept putting it off, almost as if I could delay reality itself. More than that, there’s a deeper sense of avoidance here—I’ve been dodging a lot of things lately, not just taxes. Personal goals, emotional check-ins, even basic self-care.

Then there’s the Four of Pentacles (Reversed), which often points to financial instability or the need to let go of control. This one stings, too. I realized part of my hesitation with taxes isn’t just laziness—it’s anxiety about money. Even though I’m doing fine financially, there’s this lingering fear that I’m not *secure enough*. Avoidance and scarcity mindset, a deadly combo.

# 🧠 Thought of the Day:

Avoidance doesn’t make things disappear; it just makes them heavier. Maybe it's time to face things head-on—before they turn into something even bigger.",1,1743931290.0,tarotjournal,0,1.0,False

A while back towards the beginning of our relationship she invited me to some after work gathering at a pub.  I shot the breeze with some people there trying to just be friendly with strangers.  One of those people was her proclaimed work-bffl a (25 M) and his girlfriend.  I had a few exchanges with them about coffee roasting and his gfs career, everything seemed like a friendly/ cordial exchange.  Well as it turns out, my gf tried to set up double dates with them and apparently he diverted/ deflected the invitations with me until eventually confessing he’s “not a fan of me” and thought I was rude to his gf and self-centered.  This is out of left field for me as I don’t recall anything close to an interaction that would’ve warranted that response but I’ll take it for what it’s worth, everyone’s entitled to their opinions.  

Well, this situation with her coworker and his dismay for me was kept as a secret for basically a year.  Within that time span, she’s had a meetup with him and his gf where she framed it as meeting up with them while blatantly omitting an invitation to me but I brushed it off not questioning it as I didn’t want to seem petty and didn’t expect any foul play.  Fast forward to a few days ago she mentions in passing that he sent her a bday invitation for Saturday.  Again, just a strange omission of mentioning it as an invitation to both of us but I still don’t question it, assuming maybe there’s a miscommunication with her phrasing.  So, the day of the party comes and she doubles down saying hey so I’m stopping by his party this evening… at this point I just ask straightforwardly; “so are you just not inviting me to come with you?  Tf is up with that?”   Mind you I’ve invited her to basically every one of my family or friends invitations.  She deflects and redirects the conversation into an argument about how I didn’t make plans with her yet and how I didn’t see her the night before and so on.. basically diverting away from the simple question at hand.  After pressing her again she finally spills the beans saying “yeah he’s not a fan of you” and gives me the alleged back story.  I was dumbfounded learning that he was sending her invitations while explicitly requesting to not have me involved, feeling like this guy at her work is basically trying to ostracize me from my own gf.  That’s not really my problem though, the main issue to me is that she catered to this coworker’s request and went to his party and their previous meetup as I’ve just learned solo.  Pretty much ditching me on a Saturday night for a male coworkers bday party who’s explicitly requested me not to come.

I don’t believe a loving partner in a relationship would do that.  I know I wouldn’t, if an opposite-sexed coworker spoke ill of my gf and requested to hang out with just me I’d think that was unacceptable and say hey maybe there’s a way we can all break bread or at least I’d decline her invitations if it meant ditching my gf for it.  So anyways, I told her I think we have different value systems and ideas on how a relationship should be and that it wasn’t going to work for my anymore.  She didn’t really seem to care as she just texted back that my reaction was disproportionate and basically gaslit me saying that I’m “unhinged” despite feeling like she betrayed me.

I’m the receptionist staff/front desk  with one other girl, an assistant manager, and my manager. 

We have three nurses who do the skincare treatments. One of the nurses, let’s call her Jocelyn, has been weird with me since I started and I dread shifts with her.

I learned pretty fast the ropes as my previous job had the same system. My manager and assistant manager have helped me out. My coworker who’s the other receptionist has been very patient and kind enough to pick me up for carpool to train me on how to open personally since I don’t have a key yet.

The two other nurses, let’s call them Autumn and Mary, also very kind.

Jocelyn was very nice to me at first but considering I was new, I was making mistakes. Not huge mistakes where it would affect the nurses at all - just little things seem to set her off and she only says it when nobody is around.

The doors are heavy and I went into the treatment room to give Jocelyn her current numbers. It slammed behind me pretty hard to my surprise. I quickly opened it and apologized. 

“Yeah - no need to slam the doors. It’s loud and everyone can hear it.”

I told her it was an accident and apologized again. I went to the break room and we have a very fancy coffee machine in there.

Jocelyn watched me as I struggled to use it and pressed the button.

She sighed first then said 

“Just press the button once. Not 100 times - or you’ll break it.”

“Good to know - thanks for letting me know.”

“Yeah just be patient or it’ll break.”

I laughed it off and joked “oh no, I wouldn’t want to be known as the girl who broke this.”

In a serious tone she goes “Yeah we all paid for this before you got here so WE want it up and running.” - I haven’t used the coffee machine since.

These are some examples but it’s constantly condescending and she’s not my manager. 

“Don’t have side conversations with a customer, close the door behind you, wipe this.” And as an adult - I just am getting fed up.

I didn’t bring it up with my coworkers and she’s everyone’s favorite. 

Last night it was my first time closing alone and unfortunately Jocelyn had to supervise me closing. She’s been there about 6 months and nurses work from opening to closing.

I have closed with my coworkers but I never see them arm/disarm the alarm.

When the last client left, I shut down the computer systems, turned off the music, emptied the trash into one bag, and charged all the electronics the next day.

We close at 8 PM. Jocelyn had her bag ready and the big trash was ready to be taken to the big dumpster which is about a 1 minute walk.

“Hey Jocelyn - can you wait here just 1 minute and I’ll quickly toss the trash?”

“You’re supposed to take it as you lock the door behind you - everybody knows that.”

I grab my lunch box, my blazer, my purse, and this flipping trash bag with my hands full.

I look at the alarm and its arrows.

“Can I watch you disarm the alarm Jocelyn? I actually realized I’ve never watched anyone do it.”

“What do you mean? Haven’t you closed so many times already? I’ve told the (managers name) how it’s weird you’re not already trained on closing.” 

“I know how to close everything in the front but it’s just the alarm I don’t know.”

“You’re supposed to do it all so you can learn and I’ll just watch you.”

She watches me move these arrows around and it’s not in alarm mode. She fiddles around - it’s very obvious she doesn’t know how to do it either. After 5-6 swipes, she sets the alarm and sighs.

I lock the door behind me, trash bag in hand with all my stuff and with my blazer, purse, lunch box, and trash bag - I head to the dumpster.

I confided in the assistant manager today what a hard time Jocelyn gave me last night and she couldn’t believe it.

“She’s literally the nicest person here - maybe she had an off day.”

It’s constant side remarks and it gets harder to ignore it.

Step-by-Step Guide to Building Your Own Storage Chest from Woodworking Plans
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Click Here to Learn How to Earn With Woodworking: https://app.leadcreator.ai/bu0xk8tha4  
  
Building a storage chest can be a rewarding woodworking project that adds style and functionality to your home. With the right woodworking plans and steps to guide you, you can create a storage chest that is both practical and beautiful. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced woodworker, this step-by-step guide will walk you through the entire process.

### Gather Your Materials

Before you get started, it's essential to gather all the necessary materials. Here’s a list of what you’ll need:

- Solid wood boards (e.g., pine, oak, or plywood)
- Wood screws
- Wood glue
- Sandpaper (various grits)
- Wood stain or paint
- Varnish or polyurethane (for a protective finish)
- Hinges and handles (optional, based on your design)
- A saw, drill, and other essential woodworking tools
 
### Choose Your Design

Select a woodworking plan that suits your style and needs. There are many designs available online, ranging from simple and functional to intricate and decorative. Look for plans that include dimensions, materials, and assembly instructions. Make any adjustments to the design according to your personal needs, like size or functionality.

### Cut the Wood Pieces

Once you have your design, it’s time to cut your wood pieces. Follow the measurements from your woodworking plans carefully. Typically, a storage chest consists of these main components:

- Two side panels
- A front panel
- A back panel
- A bottom panel
- A top (lid) panel
 
Use a saw to make clean cuts and ensure edges are straight. If you are unsure about your cutting skills, consider using a miter saw for precision.

### Assemble the Chest Structure

With all your pieces cut, it’s time to assemble them. Start by attaching the bottom panel to the side panels using wood glue and screws for stability. Make sure everything is square, as this will affect how well the chest opens and closes.

Next, attach the front and back panels. If your design includes any decorative features, like bevels or notches, now is the time to incorporate them. Take your time and ensure everything is secured firmly.

### Attach the Lid

The lid is an essential part of your storage chest. Attach it using hinges to allow for easy opening. If you want a more sophisticated look, consider a weighted lid that will stay open without falling. Make sure to choose hinges that are robust enough to support the weight of the lid.

### Sanding and Finishing Touches

Once the chest is assembled, it’s time for sanding. Start with a coarse grit to smooth the surfaces and work up to a fine grit for a polished finish. Sand the edges carefully to prevent splinters.

After sanding, choose a wood stain or paint to enhance the wood's natural beauty or add color. Apply it evenly and allow it to dry thoroughly. Once dry, finish with a coat of varnish or polyurethane for protection and durability. This step is crucial for maintaining the chest’s look and longevity.

### Final Assembly and Personalization

After the finish has cured, it’s time to add any personal touches such as handles, decorative elements, or stenciled designs. Consider lining the inside with fabric for an added touch of elegance.

Your storage chest is now complete! Enjoy the satisfaction of using and showcasing a piece that you crafted with your own hands. This chest can serve as storage for blankets, toys, or even serve as a coffee table, depending on its design.

Remember, building a storage chest not only helps you organize your space but also hones your woodworking skills. Each step is an opportunity to learn and grow as a woodworker. So gather your materials, follow the instructions, and get started on your woodworking journey!

</div>### Conclusion

Creating your own storage chest can be a rewarding project that combines practicality with personal craftsmanship. When selecting woodworking plans, it's crucial to focus on essential features that enhance both functionality and aesthetics. Look for plans that provide clear dimensions, detailed diagrams, and a comprehensive list of materials to ensure a smooth building process.

Following a step-by-step guide will not only simplify the construction but also empower you to bring your vision to life. As you initiate the building process, remember to take your time with each step. Attention to detail during assembly will guarantee a sturdy and long-lasting storage chest that meets your needs.

Consider personalizing your design with unique finishes or hardware that reflects your style. This not only gives your storage chest a character but also creates a treasured piece that can be passed down through generations.
