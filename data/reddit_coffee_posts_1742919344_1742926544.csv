After years of pining for one, I finally got a Creatista Pro a few weeks ago. One issue I've come across is that it's very difficult to use the keyboard when saving a new recipe. The on-screen keyboard is not very responsive, especially close to the edges. When mistyping one letter it takes dozens of attempts for the backspace key to ""take"" to correct my mistake. When making coffee from a pre-programmed recipe the screen works fine, even when adjusting the parameters. So it's really only when using the keyboard near the edges of the screen. Is this common among Creatista Pros, or should I file a claim under the warranty? 

Another minor thing is that the stainless steel finish surrounding the drip tray suffered damage from the steam wand cleaning process within the first few days. There are spots on the finish which can't be wiped clean, so it looks like the water drops from when the wand sprays water may be too hot for the finish to withstand. Is this common?

1jjq14q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wilmington/comments/1jjq14q/epiphany/,Epiphany,"Hey folks. I became homeless in Wilmington because of a brain injury from an attempted murder. I had to teach myself to read and write all over again, under the 3rd St. bridge. Now, I have made it my mission to let people know what it's like to be homeless in America. Below is an essay I wrote: Epiphany. 


 

When you first become homeless it really takes a little while for your psyche to grasp the full scope of your situation. For a while, your mind will refuse to think it into reality. 



For a day or so, I kept thinking that as soon as someone caught the mistake, found where someone must have overlooked something, everything would get back to normal, and the manager would apologize.
 


Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up and start a pot of coffee. Then, I'll stand over the sink and stare out of the kitchen window for too long, thinking about it even looks cold out this morning. 



I'll wrap my robe up snug against the cold, put my old sneakers on, and walk out of the front door to the end of the driveway, taking time to breathe in the crisp cool air. I'll stop and the end of the driveway and take my time bending over to pick up the morning paper, making it a grander affair than need be. 



I'll open it with the sharp practiced snap of a news professional so I can give the headline a quick glance. I wanted a rundown of the news before I went back into the house, like I would be confronted and tested before I could get my coffee. 



I would search in vain for some sort of headline that change the course of my day, like, ""Aliens Attack Everywhere, And They Mean Business "" or ""Asteroid To Collide With Earth In About An Hour"". 



Seeing that the headlines were the same old lines from yesterday, and the yesterday before, about another billion dollar company thinking about opening another store in the area, or some major league manufacturing jobs were coming next year, or how they were shutting down the rec center and increasing budget for enforcement. Everythings subject to changes if a stiff breeze blows. 



I'll furrow my brow to feel as serious as possible as I slowly look up and down the street for a second or two, pausing for effect, like I always do. 'My turn at guard'. My morning duty to the community. 



I'll notice the Wornicks finally mowed their lawn yesterday and left grass clippings all over the road. They put that birdbath that my wife wants to run over there and clean in the front yard again. 



Looking over I'll see that old Mrs. Brackson forgot to pull her garbage to the road, so I'll walk over there, again, and wheel it to the curb even though I'm thinking I shouldn't after the way she hollered at the kids yesterday. 



In the quiet of the moment I'll be able to hear the humming of electricity in the lines above my head, then I'll turn around and quickly make my way back in and out of the cold and the Columbian warm aroma of my kitchen, pouring myself a cup, and standing over the heat vent I'll let the warmth envelope me. 



I'll know from routine that I have about twenty minutes left before time to wake up the boy and get him, cleaned up a tad, and properly pumped for a day of school. 



The thought of the love I have for my son will fire a flash of dopamine through my brain, and I'll react with a smile of contentment. 
 


Twenty-three years of rinse and repeat. Twenty-three. Rinse and repeat.
 


After a couple of days and it starts to sink in a little more, becoming realer, more tangible. 



Now you're wondering if that second cousin, the one you hated so much still lives in that big old house in, Whereverville. It doesn't matter, anyway. You wouldn't know where, or how to look for her. Your mom was the only one who ever really talked to her, and she hasn't been much help since she passed away. 



If you could just find a way to get a little re-start, some time to catch your breath, plant your feet before plowing forward again. 



In your imagination you keep seeing doorways that open to nothingness, a mirage to a desperate gold miner in the hot Nevada sun. Everyone evaporates as you try to reach for them.
 


You start to understand that this mistake would not be found. There would be no correction. There will be no managers refund or time put back on the clock.
 


The Day of My Epiphany, I was sitting in the back area of the local community college, where just two years earlier I had sat at the exact same picnic table and watched the Cape Fear River swirl and eddy for my enjoyment while I relaxed over lunch between classes. 



In those days, I worried about Algebra. At that time, my biggest concern was if I could get my homework done before dinner so I could hang out with everyone before time we went to bed. 



Sometimes, when I would carry my son to bed, I would be listening as his grumbling morphed its way into soft snores, head back, safe and no concern in the world. 



Would I be able to stay awake long enough to see my favorite show that night? 
 


I thought back about those concerns, realizing more and more that my concerns now had turned to a much more serious nature than any television show that I couldn't even remember now. 
 


All the times over the last couple of days I had been wanting and hoping that this was all a dream, some nightmare that I would wake from and shake off. When the real truth was that my past life had been the dream all along, I had woken into this harsh, cold reality. I once sat staring at the river, and now I was staring into it.
 


My brain was exhausted from constantly trying to either reason this situation away or make some sense of how I got there. 



No one was going to walk by and think that I had any potential. An unrecognizable feeling washed over me, drenching me, as sure as it had been poured from a bucket. The wind felt crisper, colder, and every little sound became louder and clearer.
 


The city sidewalks were busy, and every noise was foreign, undistinguished from all the others. An auditory blur. Emotions were threatening to well up from a part of my stomach that felt empty and flat upon itself.



I was alone, totally alone, and none of the faces that I could see appeared to be sympathetic in the least. No friendlies in sight. Desolation.
 


I wanted to tell someone, just call them up, get some advice from Pops, but I couldn't think of anyone I could call, and Pops had fielded his last question. What would I even say? What would I ask?



I was so numb by the acknowledgment that I didn't even notice the first few tears. When I did notice, it took me a bit too long to turn them off. I once did it so easily, before. Dad strong for the family. A life so far away, an alien world or distant dream. Or maybe just something in the corner of my eye. 
 


I noticed that the dirty blanket draped over my shoulders had lost the battle to keep me warm hours ago, just like it had lost the battle to stay raveled at some point.
 


It wasn't long before I started to recognize, spot the social cues, the little and not so little clues people give you. Some to let you know that you are not a friend they haven't met, but rather a blight they would like to avoid. 



Strangers no longer nodded their heads with a smile of quiet salutations when I passed walking on the sidewalk. I couldn't remember the last time someone actually smiled or spoke. 



I started to notice the ladies who clutched their bags tight against their bodies, then I realized that it was because of me, not some danger that I didn't recognize or couldn't see. People now thought that I was the danger. Me. From most trusted to checking to see if the revolver is loaded.
 


My view of the world started changing as well, piece by piece, bit by bit, perception by perception. Instead of being my outgoing gregarious self, I attempted to become invisible, to fade into the background of the streets around me. I had to become something that I wasn't.
 


Those first couple of days, I wandered a lot. Confused, disheveled, and stunned looking for places that I could hide and maybe try to sleep, just maybe catch a nap, just blink for a little longer. 



I had never been so exhausted. I would have never dreamed of being so exhausted. I only got to sleep when sleep overtook me. Sitting on a bench or picnic table somewhere. Nowhere comfortable, of course.
 


It didn't take long for me to see that I wasn't allowed to get comfortable. I had no idea before becoming homeless just how offensive sleeping is to the general public. Never knew anybody who felt traumatized by seeing someone asleep. 



It occurred to me that I could sit at any bench with my underwear on my head while singing crude sailor songs as long as I didn't fall asleep.



Another law passed one day when some legislator saw a man asleep on a bench and thought that mans existence to be unsightly. 
 


People shooing me away, playing loud music, putting up no loitering or trespassing signs, segmented benches, and spikes in the sidewalks to keep us away from the safest places to sleep. I now belonged to a social class that wasn't allowed to rest. 



It had never dawned on me before, the lengths companies go through to deprive the homeless of sleep. If I slept over three or four hours I would wake up in a panic about where I was. Was anyone looking?
 


All the things I had taken for granted through the years, the ability to rest on a regular basis, on schedule most every time never really crossed my mind. Now I moved on auto pilot. Trying to avoid any obstacles or not to run any red lights. Cruise control until the gas just runs out. 



So many things to were no longer even options on the homeless menu. 



When I felt hungry, I couldn't just walk into a store and get food or slide through the drive thru in secret an hour dinner. I rarely even got to choose my own dinner. I couldn't just get in the shower or throw my clothes in the washer, or even get myself a glass of water. 



No matter how exhausted or sleepy I was, I had nowhere comfortable or even safe to grab some quick shut eye. Eight hours had become some abstract illusion. 



Even the very call of nature now required planning and execution. Instead of closing the door and locking it, I had to wonder if my position was concealed enough. There are no provisions in the law for ""I simply couldn't hold it anymore.""
 


When I realized that my very biological functions were now under scrutiny and under threat of arrest, the delusions that had been propping me up began to crumble and fall. None of my family would magically come back to life and reach out to me, no one was going to talk to me, think I was special, that I didn't belong here and escort me down to a path of prosperity. 



I wasn't going to suddenly remember the phone number of a friend that might help a brother out. No cavalry is coming in the nick of time. 
 


Sitting at that picnic table, staring at the Cape Fear River, it finally came to me that no one was going to find the mistake because there had been no mistake. Just an unfortunate compilation of tragic events coming to its ultimate conclusion. 



The winds of fate had swept me up and deposited me here, and most importantly, here I was.

It's a hybrid office/warehouse setting and their are two vending machines on the office side of the building. I bought a soda from the drink machine and it tasted kind of weird, when I mentioned it to one of the guys here he said, ""Ahh man I don't remember when the last time they restocked those machines was"". Friday of last week I bought a double decker creme pie and it was pretty decent taste. So this week I bought one on Monday and again it didn't taste bad, so today I bought another one. I noticed it was the last one in the line so I kind of just stared at it a little bit when I received it. I ended up eating it with a coffee I bring everyday from the house. When I took the first bite their was a peculiar taste but I just chalked it up to it mixing with the coffee and that's where that was coming from. It wasn't too bad so I eventually got over it and finished the whole thing. Welp, it's pretty safe to say that I now have the bubble guts. Which really sucks because theirs only 3 of us that work in this building and I keep having to go to the restroom and since I just started it looks really bad on my part to constantly get up and go to the restroom.

‚∏ª

Alright, get comfortable, grab a coffee, take a deep breath, because we‚Äôre about to talk about a subject that, clearly, goes beyond absurdity: the people who‚Äôve decided that seeing Est shirtless is a national priority.

I‚Äôll ask a very simple question: is this normal to you? No, seriously. Since when are we supposed to go into collective trance, chant incantations, and beg as if our lives depend on seeing an actor without a shirt? Do you think this is some sacred ritual? A new currency? A fundamental right written into the Constitution?

Tell me if it‚Äôs just me not understanding the world we live in anymore.

Because, in case some people (meaning those who humiliated themselves by starting this dubious trend) missed it, Est doesn‚Äôt want to show his body. Have you seen his recent posts? Seen how he covers up? This is no coincidence. He made that choice, maybe he‚Äôs not comfortable, and that‚Äôs his right. So why force it?

Why do you think your unhealthy desire to see him shirtless takes precedence over his comfort? Why, in 2025, do we still need to explain that men can feel uncomfortable with their bodies? That they can have insecurities? That they‚Äôre not here to be consumed like pieces of meat on a shelf?

Because, let‚Äôs be honest, what we‚Äôve seen these past few days is harassment, plain and simple.

And the worst part? It‚Äôs often coming from the same people who spend their lives shouting about protecting rights, respect, and human dignity. But strangely, when it‚Äôs an actor they like, all of that disappears. Suddenly, it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe want to see,‚Äù ‚Äúwe want a photo,‚Äù ‚Äúwhy is he hiding?‚Äù ‚ÄúIs he insecure?‚Äù ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs an actor, he has to deal with it.‚Äù

Excuse me? Deal with what exactly?

He‚Äôs an actor, not a stripper, not a Calvin Klein model, not an action figure you can dismantle and rebuild according to your desires. He owes you nothing.

But no, we keep going. We force him. We insist. We make it a trend on Twitter. We create hundreds of tweets, videos, montages. To see what? A chest. A chest, ladies and gentlemen. Do you realize the level of degradation?

And I‚Äôm going to take it a step further, because I see some people coming with their ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that serious.‚Äù Okay, imagine for a second that we do exactly the same thing with an actress. Imagine a group of straight guys starts yelling everywhere, ‚Äúshow us your legs,‚Äù ‚Äúmake us happy,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs not mean, we just want to see.‚Äù Everyone would be freaking out, and rightly so.

But when it‚Äôs a man, strangely, it‚Äôs not a big deal. It‚Äôs even funny.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not mean.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a trend.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe knows he‚Äôs good-looking.‚Äù

Right. So men don‚Äôt deserve respect? So we can objectify them without any problem? They just have to take it because ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù?

You know what? You disgust me.

And honestly, I‚Äôll be tough, but it‚Äôs necessary: you‚Äôre perverts.

Yeah, it‚Äôs been said. Because there‚Äôs no other word for it. We don‚Äôt behave like that with someone we respect. And the worst part is that these same people will still dare to say they ‚Äúlove‚Äù Est, that they ‚Äúsupport‚Äù him, that they‚Äôre his ‚Äúfans.‚Äù Oh yeah? Well, I hope I never have fans like that. Because if this is what support looks like, I‚Äôd rather have haters.

In fact, all this is just fantasies from frustrated heterosexual people who have nothing else to do but turn actors into sexual objects. It‚Äôs unhealthy.

And you know what? I‚Äôm tired.

Tired of seeing the same patterns repeat. Tired of seeing people treat actors like accessories. Tired of seeing that some people refuse to understand that respect is not flexible.

Est doesn‚Äôt want to show his body. Period.

And if you have a problem with that, I suggest you turn off your phone, go get some fresh air, and most importantly, go see a therapist.",1,1742926004.0,JoongEstPlanet,0,1.0,False

1jjpw3e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dublin/comments/1jjpw3e/a_memorable_encounter_on_grafton_street/,A memorable encounter on grafton street,"Last weekend, I was wandering along Grafton Street when I noticed an older homeless gentleman sitting quietly by the curb. Moved by a sudden impulse, I reached into my pocket and handed him a few coins. He looked up and said, ‚ÄúFunny thing about Dublin, lad‚Äîone day you‚Äôre on top of the world, giving the homeless spare change, the next, you‚Äôre the one receiving it, watching everyone pass you by.

I sort of laughed but then asked him how he ended up where he is. Knelt down beside him. He began sharing stories from his youth‚Äîhow he once played music in the cozy pubs off Camden Street, filling Dublin pubs with song. He spoke about how he Had a job, a house, a family.

It is a long story, just typing this out quickly so sorry for any grammatical mistakes. Please I need help.

In 2023, I met this resident physician through a dating app. Let's call him John. When I met him, I thought I had found my husband. He was very charming, super intelligent, and also very cultured. The thought that I could be bringing a physician into my family was exciting, and felt like I would be making my parents proud, as they value academic success highly. When I met him, he was applying for an emergency medicine fellowship. During my time of knowing him, he was very busy and going through residency. He was working long and hard hours, was often away in other cities for work, and I barely was able to see him physicially. Despite this, we spoke often. He would give me every minute he could possibly afford, at the same time while dealing with lack of sleep, not eating well, and just overall living through the mental and physical demands of residency. Despite our closeness and because of the lack of energy/time/mental clarity he had due to residency, John was unable to get into a commited relationship with me, despite me really wanting one. Everytime I would ask him about his thoughts on any updates with our relationship, he would say there were things he still needed to explore within our dynamic before he could fully commit. For example, he felt often there was a gap in maturity and experience due to our age (we are 4 years apart), he felt like he wasn't able to be emotionally vulnerable with me (but wasn't sure if this was just with me or in general, as a person). He is a super intelligent person and has often stated that he has not been mentally stimulated in conversation, and that is something he would like to have in a partner. He also mentioned that having a partner who is also a high earning would be admirable (I work a $70k job as a new grad). The traits he would describe for his ‚Äútrue love‚Äùwere often a picture not of me. John often has described me as not his dream woman, and not the person he sees sharing his future with and because of this, he also needed to explore more of me. This required breaking a lot of personal boundaries for me. For example, he wanted to explore sex because it‚Äôs an activity of emotional vulnerability and something that makes him feel close to me -  particularly sex without a condom. Sex is sacred to me and something I am uncomfortable exploring so openly, as I‚Äôve wished to keep those things reserved for just my future husband. Despite this, I engaged and pushed myself to break these boundaries because I loved him and wanted to give him a chance to fully explore his needs, in hopes he would commit to me. We pursued an uncommitted, but implied exclusive (despite me practically begging for exclusivity) situationship for just under two years. During this time, I lied to my friends and told them we had stopped seeing eachother, as they did not approve of me being in this uncommitted relationship for so long and worried for my wellbeing, but I still saw John in secret because I loved him. Towards the end of the two years, I started to feel myself becoming burnt out from pining after someone who didn't seem to feel the same about me and slowly started to draw away from him.

During the latter half of this time, I would hang out with my tight-knit group of friends, of which one is named Hector. Hector was introduced to my highschool friend group through my friend Emily. Hector and Emily dated for 5 years, until a couple months ago, when Hector shockingly broke up with Emily. Over the last year, we learned that Emily was going through a huge mental health crisis, where she periodically was admitted to a mental institution. We learned over the 5 years of their relationship, Emily was secretly mentally and physically abusive towards Hector. Hector recounted stories of how Emily would hit him - one time they were driving and Emily was hitting his face having a mental health breakdown/episode, and how onlookers witnessed this and called the police. On top of this, Emily‚Äôs mom is also mentally unwell and her family was going through severe debt, and came to rely on Hector for financial assistance. Hector, who was only a young undergraduate student at the time, and his family, spent over $50k CAD to help Emily. This ranged from paying off their credit card statements, bills, and even buying Emily MULTIPLE laptops and iPhones because she would break them during her mental health breakdowns. Hector felt like Emily‚Äôs caregiver. During Emily‚Äôs mental health crisis, she became distant from the friend group, her mentally unwell mom did not allow her to go outside due to paranoia. After the breakup, Hector who distanced himself while going through this turmoil with Emily, re-integrated himself into the friend group, and this was well-received and even brought the friend group closer. Many of us have tried to reach out to Emily to hangout because we feel bad, but the effort does not seem reciprocated, as Emily has mentioned the attempts to reach out to her seem ""fake"". Personally, despite Emily being in the same friend group as me, I was never the biggest fan of her. I felt we often collided heads and she was difficult to talk to. However, we remained friends on a superficial layer due to our mutual friend group, and physicially being in the same space.

A couple months ago, Hector got a new condo and would often invite us over. This was an amazing time as he was the first in the friend group to get his own place, and allowed us a small space of privacy and room to have fun. We would do activities, throw parties, eat, drink, etc and formed a lot of memories there. During this time, Hector and I would speak more and got closer. During our 5 years of knowing eachother, we never spoke outside any means of necessity, thus it felt like I had discovered a new friend. We instantly clicked and bonded on common interests, common similarities of values and our upbringings. Hector felt like the male version of myself. During the 5 year relationship between Hector and Emily, I would often look up to how Hector treated Emily and admired how much he did for her and loved her. I would often wish my boyfriend at the time would do similar things, such as bringing flowers, going out on dates, being complimented, etc. All of a sudden, I found Hector doing nice things for me. For example, he would make me coffee at 3am without me asking just because I mentioned it. We go to the gym one on one, go out to eat, and talk to eachother on a daily basis. One day we both wanted to go to the club (something I‚Äôve always wanted to do more but none of my friends would be free) and in a drunken state, Hector revealed he had feelings for me. I immediately told him no, because despite her not really being in the friend group, he still dated Emily from my friend group from highschool for 5 years, and I thought dating a ‚Äúfriend's‚Äù ex would be great betrayal, especially as Emily was already going through a mental health crisis. I thought to distance myself from Hector after this, however, as much as I really wanted to, I wasn't able to. I missed him and constantly wanted to talk to him.

During this time I was still seeing John secretly and asked him for a break, but for one specifically where we could talk to other people if the opportunity arose because I wanted to explore the circumstances with Hector. During this time, I went out on dates with Hector. Hector took me to places I always wanted to go. He brought me flowers, he cared for me. He planned a whole valentines day date under the stars, which was never done for me before. Doing things for me came so easily to Hector. Hector made it known he felt I was the one. He was ready to commit to me, he saw me as his dream woman. However, he knew I felt guilty doing this behind Emily‚Äôs back, and also the feelings I had for John, so he told me to take my time and did not coerce me into anything. I felt myself start to develop feelings for Hector.

John in the meanwhile, called me two weeks into the break. He said that the short time we spent apart made him realize that he loved me - That beforehand he was acting on logic, however his residency blocks were a bit more calm now, which gave him more time and mental clarity to think, and he was able to sort out his feelings and he realized he was in love with me. I told him about Hector and he reacted very negatively, disgusted that I could explore something like that with not only a close friend and staple person in my friendgroup, but with an ex to someone who was ‚Äúa close friend‚Äù. John said that he called me because he wanted to surprise me with flowers and ask me to be his girlfriend, but because of the situation with Hector, he has trust issues (John also has PTSD about a situation where another guy is in the picture because he was cheated on by his ex). John still wanted to give me a chance and asked me to work out my feelings for Hector. John then mentioned he wanted to go on trips with me, wanted me to be his girlfriend, wife and then mother of my children. He wanted to commit to me, and build a future with me. He told me he loved me. These were all things I dreamed of hearing at one point, but when John said these things, I felt overwhelmed.

I told Hector that John was back in the picture this way. This made Hector scared that he would lose me, but didn't pressure me to choosing him. Hector said he would wait for me, and to make a decision that would be best for me and to not think about worrying about hurting him. He told me to follow my heart. I have been torn apart mentally because of being put in this situation. At one point I told Hector I would just walk away despite having feelings for him, because I hate keeping him in this situation. Despite this, Hector  constantly fought for me, saying that I am the love of his life and he didn't want to lose me. Hector stated multiple times that he would take care of me, no matter what. He just wanted me to commit to him.

John on the otherhand is a bit more emotionally volatile, he often said that he wouldn't think twice about me if our situation was to end, and wouldn't talk nor want to know what's going on in my life out of respect for his future partner. He is 4 years older than me so he would be getting married even in the next year or so. John also mentioned how he is only a couple months away from finishing residency, and how once he's done he'll have more time to be a loving and dedicated partner. He also states that I was patient and with him for almost the whole duration of his residency - that if he doesn't end up with me, the next girl basically reaps the benefits I sowed due to the progress in emotional exploration he‚Äôs made. However, John is suddenly being so loving towards me, he brought me roses the other day. He often talks about a relationship and marriage. To me, it is so sudden as there wasn't a gradual progression into this. He suddenly came back a changed person, and feeling more like a boyfriend. He says he is ready to commit and just waiting on me to make a firm decision to be in this with him, however he still has some trust issues with Hector. He says this may mean  that in order to trust me fully means I do not see Hector, not even in a group setting.

I am torn because as superficial as it is, status and prestige also mean a lot to me. Choosing John  basically guarantees financial freedom as he will be a physician making $300-500k CAD even within the next year. John also claims/shown with some more time (which he claims he will have more of after residency), he can be a caring and loving partner and do things for me. The idea of bringing a doctor, in the same culture as me, into my household is something that would wow my parents, family and friends. However, I know as a working physician he will be busy and not available all the time. I continue to be in awe of his intelligence and often look forward to our mentally stimulating conversations. i feel i can often ask him for advice, guidance, and even an alternative perspective. However, i find his ultra-logic personality and sometimes lack of emotion difficult to navigate, as I often feel I have to argue with him to get him to understand how I feel. On the other hand, Hector  accepts me for who I am. I did not have to break down any boundaries for him. He readily plans dates, understands me in a way he can just understand me without me having to say things. He constantly wants to take care of me, and would go to the ends of the earth for me. Hector is very trusting of me despite my situation with John, and ready to pursue a relationship as soon as I would say I am ready. He comes from a very loving and well-off family, with a mother who I know would love me unconditionally. His father is a senior scientist at a university and makes good money. Hector is currently doing his masters and will go on to get a PHD in a field related to AI. He claims he will eventually get a good job that earns well (maybe around the $200k mark). My parents know of him as he was part of my friend group, and I know they would like him. I am just afraid of the guilt of pursuing a relationship with Hector because he is the ex of a longterm ""friend"" Emily  who is now no longer really part of our friendgroup. Hector and Emily dated for 5 years and were well-known in our community as well, thus I am afraid of drama and rumours of being a home-wrecker from people who don't know the history. On top of this, if Hector and I break up in the future for any reason, it could mean putting our friends in a place where they need to choose between us, and potentially losing my closest friends. Hector also is becoming more of a conversationalist, but is not capable of mentally stimulating conversation/challenging in the same way John is. However, doing and caring comes very easily for Hector.

I am torn because I have feelings for two people - I am deeply afraid of regret. I am afraid I will choose Hector and then think about how John is probably treating his next girl right, and she will get to live a prestigious and lavish lifestyle due to the money he brings in, despite me being the one who allowed John to progress on emotional exploration. However, I don't know how much ""trust"" John needs to see in me first before he can fully commit. If I choose John, then I would think about how loving Hector would also be so understanding and loving of his next partner. Hector would also introduce his new partner into the friend group and that is something I'd have to live with. Please provide any insight and guidance you have, now knowing this situation.

So elephants have religion. Except she didn't care for religion, Pentecostals especially, but she respected the elephants for it. How they ritualize death and visit their graves. She said she thinks its even a mammalian thing. Latent from our generational trauma stretching back to the Cretaceous when the firmament ripped divine wrath, or was it our preternature for empathy?

The diagnosis explained a lot. So they recommended I try taking Ritalin. Initially it felt amazing..so experimented with doses for about 6 months. But I was also drinking coffee and the seam to make me a bit jittery. So I stopped drinking coffee cold turkey and restarted on the ritalin. Now, I've been drinking coffee since I was 16. My favourite is filter coffee. I could have anywhere between three and five coffees a day. 

So I had another 4 months on Ritalin and no caffeine, then as of 2 weeks ago, stopped taking the ritalin. I've never felt better - more focused, better energy, no anxiety and just a great sense of calm.

I smoked cigarettes and weed from about 16 to 30. So this really is for the first time in my life I've never had 'stimulants'. 

Has anyone else tried this and what effect did it have on your ADHD? 

I do miss coffee but will never drink caffeine again as I'd be too tempted with lovely tasting coffee.",1,1742925638.0,CaffeineFreeLife,0,1.0,False

In 2023, I met this resident physician through a dating app. Let's call him John. When I met him, I thought I had found my husband. He was very charming, super intelligent, and also very cultured. The thought that I could be bringing a physician into my family was exciting, and felt like I would be making my parents proud, as they value academic success highly. When I met him, he was applying for an emergency medicine fellowship. During my time of knowing him, he was very busy and going through residency. He was working long and hard hours, was often away in other cities for work, and I barely was able to see him physicially. Despite this, we spoke often. He would give me every minute he could possibly afford, at the same time while dealing with lack of sleep, not eating well, and just overall living through the mental and physical demands of residency. Despite our closeness and because of the lack of energy/time/mental clarity he had due to residency, John was unable to get into a commited relationship with me, despite me really wanting one. Everytime I would ask him about his thoughts on any updates with our relationship, he would say there were things he still needed to explore within our dynamic before he could fully commit. For example, he felt often there was a gap in maturity and experience due to our age (we are 4 years apart), he felt like he wasn't able to be emotionally vulnerable with me (but wasn't sure if this was just with me or in general, as a person). He is a super intelligent person and has often stated that he has not been mentally stimulated in conversation, and that is something he would like to have in a partner. He also mentioned that having a partner who is also a high earning would be admirable (I work a $70k job as a new grad). The traits he would describe for his ‚Äútrue love‚Äùwere often a picture not of me. John often has described me as not his dream woman, and not the person he sees sharing his future with and because of this, he also needed to explore more of me. This required breaking a lot of personal boundaries for me. For example, he wanted to explore sex because it‚Äôs an activity of emotional vulnerability and something that makes him feel close to me -  particularly sex without a condom. Sex is sacred to me and something I am uncomfortable exploring so openly, as I‚Äôve wished to keep those things reserved for just my future husband. Despite this, I engaged and pushed myself to break these boundaries because I loved him and wanted to give him a chance to fully explore his needs, in hopes he would commit to me. We pursued an uncommitted, but implied exclusive (despite me practically begging for exclusivity) situationship for just under two years. During this time, I lied to my friends and told them we had stopped seeing eachother, as they did not approve of me being in this uncommitted relationship for so long and worried for my wellbeing, but I still saw John in secret because I loved him. Towards the end of the two years, I started to feel myself becoming burnt out from pining after someone who didn't seem to feel the same about me and slowly started to draw away from him.

During the latter half of this time, I would hang out with my tight-knit group of friends, of which one is named Hector. Hector was introduced to my highschool friend group through my friend Emily. Hector and Emily dated for 5 years, until a couple months ago, when Hector shockingly broke up with Emily. Over the last year, we learned that Emily was going through a huge mental health crisis, where she periodically was admitted to a mental institution. We learned over the 5 years of their relationship, Emily was secretly mentally and physically abusive towards Hector. Hector recounted stories of how Emily would hit him - one time they were driving and Emily was hitting his face having a mental health breakdown/episode, and how onlookers witnessed this and called the police. On top of this, Emily‚Äôs mom is also mentally unwell and her family was going through severe debt, and came to rely on Hector for financial assistance. Hector, who was only a young undergraduate student at the time, and his family, spent over $50k CAD to help Emily. This ranged from paying off their credit card statements, bills, and even buying Emily MULTIPLE laptops and iPhones because she would break them during her mental health breakdowns. Hector felt like Emily‚Äôs caregiver. During Emily‚Äôs mental health crisis, she became distant from the friend group, her mentally unwell mom did not allow her to go outside due to paranoia. After the breakup, Hector who distanced himself while going through this turmoil with Emily, re-integrated himself into the friend group, and this was well-received and even brought the friend group closer. Many of us have tried to reach out to Emily to hangout because we feel bad, but the effort does not seem reciprocated, as Emily has mentioned the attempts to reach out to her seem ""fake"". Personally, despite Emily being in the same friend group as me, I was never the biggest fan of her. I felt we often collided heads and she was difficult to talk to. However, we remained friends on a superficial layer due to our mutual friend group, and physicially being in the same space.

A couple months ago, Hector got a new condo and would often invite us over. This was an amazing time as he was the first in the friend group to get his own place, and allowed us a small space of privacy and room to have fun. We would do activities, throw parties, eat, drink, etc and formed a lot of memories there. During this time, Hector and I would speak more and got closer. During our 5 years of knowing eachother, we never spoke outside any means of necessity, thus it felt like I had discovered a new friend. We instantly clicked and bonded on common interests, common similarities of values and our upbringings. Hector felt like the male version of myself. During the 5 year relationship between Hector and Emily, I would often look up to how Hector treated Emily and admired how much he did for her and loved her. I would often wish my boyfriend at the time would do similar things, such as bringing flowers, going out on dates, being complimented, etc. All of a sudden, I found Hector doing nice things for me. For example, he would make me coffee at 3am without me asking just because I mentioned it. We go to the gym one on one, go out to eat, and talk to eachother on a daily basis. One day we both wanted to go to the club (something I‚Äôve always wanted to do more but none of my friends would be free) and in a drunken state, Hector revealed he had feelings for me. I immediately told him no, because despite her not really being in the friend group, he still dated Emily from my friend group from highschool for 5 years, and I thought dating a ‚Äúfriend's‚Äù ex would be great betrayal, especially as Emily was already going through a mental health crisis. I thought to distance myself from Hector after this, however, as much as I really wanted to, I wasn't able to. I missed him and constantly wanted to talk to him.

During this time I was still seeing John secretly and asked him for a break, but for one specifically where we could talk to other people if the opportunity arose because I wanted to explore the circumstances with Hector. During this time, I went out on dates with Hector. Hector took me to places I always wanted to go. He brought me flowers, he cared for me. He planned a whole valentines day date under the stars, which was never done for me before. Doing things for me came so easily to Hector. Hector made it known he felt I was the one. He was ready to commit to me, he saw me as his dream woman. However, he knew I felt guilty doing this behind Emily‚Äôs back, and also the feelings I had for John, so he told me to take my time and did not coerce me into anything. I felt myself start to develop feelings for Hector.

John in the meanwhile, called me two weeks into the break. He said that the short time we spent apart made him realize that he loved me - That beforehand he was acting on logic, however his residency blocks were a bit more calm now, which gave him more time and mental clarity to think, and he was able to sort out his feelings and he realized he was in love with me. I told him about Hector and he reacted very negatively, disgusted that I could explore something like that with not only a close friend and staple person in my friendgroup, but with an ex to someone who was ‚Äúa close friend‚Äù. John said that he called me because he wanted to surprise me with flowers and ask me to be his girlfriend, but because of the situation with Hector, he has trust issues (John also has PTSD about a situation where another guy is in the picture because he was cheated on by his ex). John still wanted to give me a chance and asked me to work out my feelings for Hector. John then mentioned he wanted to go on trips with me, wanted me to be his girlfriend, wife and then mother of my children. He wanted to commit to me, and build a future with me. He told me he loved me. These were all things I dreamed of hearing at one point, but when John said these things, I felt overwhelmed.

I told Hector that John was back in the picture this way. This made Hector scared that he would lose me, but didn't pressure me to choosing him. Hector said he would wait for me, and to make a decision that would be best for me and to not think about worrying about hurting him. He told me to follow my heart. I have been torn apart mentally because of being put in this situation. At one point I told Hector I would just walk away despite having feelings for him, because I hate keeping him in this situation. Despite this, Hector  constantly fought for me, saying that I am the love of his life and he didn't want to lose me. Hector stated multiple times that he would take care of me, no matter what. He just wanted me to commit to him.

John on the otherhand is a bit more emotionally volatile, he often said that he wouldn't think twice about me if our situation was to end, and wouldn't talk nor want to know what's going on in my life out of respect for his future partner. He is 4 years older than me so he would be getting married even in the next year or so. John also mentioned how he is only a couple months away from finishing residency, and how once he's done he'll have more time to be a loving and dedicated partner. He also states that I was patient and with him for almost the whole duration of his residency - that if he doesn't end up with me, the next girl basically reaps the benefits I sowed due to the progress in emotional exploration he‚Äôs made. However, John is suddenly being so loving towards me, he brought me roses the other day. He often talks about a relationship and marriage. To me, it is so sudden as there wasn't a gradual progression into this. He suddenly came back a changed person, and feeling more like a boyfriend. He says he is ready to commit and just waiting on me to make a firm decision to be in this with him, however he still has some trust issues with Hector. He says this may mean  that in order to trust me fully means I do not see Hector, not even in a group setting.

I am torn because as superficial as it is, status and prestige also mean a lot to me. Choosing John  basically guarantees financial freedom as he will be a physician making $300-500k CAD even within the next year. John also claims/shown with some more time (which he claims he will have more of after residency), he can be a caring and loving partner and do things for me. The idea of bringing a doctor, in the same culture as me, into my household is something that would wow my parents, family and friends. However, I know as a working physician he will be busy and not available all the time. I continue to be in awe of his intelligence and often look forward to our mentally stimulating conversations. i feel i can often ask him for advice, guidance, and even an alternative perspective. However, i find his ultra-logic personality and sometimes lack of emotion difficult to navigate, as I often feel I have to argue with him to get him to understand how I feel. On the other hand, Hector  accepts me for who I am. I did not have to break down any boundaries for him. He readily plans dates, understands me in a way he can just understand me without me having to say things. He constantly wants to take care of me, and would go to the ends of the earth for me. Hector is very trusting of me despite my situation with John, and ready to pursue a relationship as soon as I would say I am ready. He comes from a very loving and well-off family, with a mother who I know would love me unconditionally. His father is a senior scientist at a university and makes good money. Hector is currently doing his masters and will go on to get a PHD in a field related to AI. He claims he will eventually get a good job that earns well (maybe around the $200k mark). My parents know of him as he was part of my friend group, and I know they would like him. I am just afraid of the guilt of pursuing a relationship with Hector because he is the ex of a longterm ""friend"" Emily  who is now no longer really part of our friendgroup. Hector and Emily dated for 5 years and were well-known in our community as well, thus I am afraid of drama and rumours of being a home-wrecker from people who don't know the history. On top of this, if Hector and I break up in the future for any reason, it could mean putting our friends in a place where they need to choose between us, and potentially losing my closest friends. Hector also is becoming more of a conversationalist, but is not capable of mentally stimulating conversation/challenging in the same way John is. However, doing and caring comes very easily for Hector.

I am torn because I have feelings for two people - I am deeply afraid of regret. I am afraid I will choose Hector and then think about how John is probably treating his next girl right, and she will get to live a prestigious and lavish lifestyle due to the money he brings in, despite me being the one who allowed John to progress on emotional exploration. However, I don't know how much ""trust"" John needs to see in me first before he can fully commit. If I choose John, then I would think about how loving Hector would also be so understanding and loving of his next partner. Hector would also introduce his new partner into the friend group and that is something I'd have to live with. Please provide any insight and guidance you have, now knowing this situation. If you were in my shoes, who would you choose?",1,1742925557.0,venting,1,1.0,False
1jjppxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1jjppxa/ive_lost_my_friend_to_a_cult/,I've lost my friend to a cult,"Well, kind of, the cult is kpop.  We're both women in our late 30s. We maybe see each other twice a year and yesterday we met up for coffee and to go shopping. Almost the entire time she was on her phone; either updating her fan twitter or texting/phoning her kpop friends. 

For reference I don't mind at all that she's found a niche she enjoys, I think it's great and even better that she's made some new friends because of it, however as we don't meet up often enough it felt so rude. I kept trying to update her and ask about life, work, kids etc. But it was one of the band members birthdays, so I felt side lined.

We would be walking along and I'd be speaking to her and I'd just hear a ""hmm"" or nothing at all, I'd turn my head and she'd be on twitter posting pics of them.  

We're supposed to be meeting again next month for my birthday, but I'm not sure I want to now. I still want to be friends, but it's like a cult. All she talked about was kpop. I'd ask about work, she'd make it about kpop. I was tired. I want to be supportive, but at this moment I'm almost worried, it's like a parasocial relationship between her and some 25 year old she's never met. She's not been in a relationship for about a year and I'm slightly worried that this addiction (?) Will hinder her chances of meeting someone else. I'm glad she's happy, but it's not healthy. 

I kept trying to steer the conversation but it would always turn back to kpop. I'm tired.",1,1742925547.0,TrueOffMyChest,1,1.0,False

However, doing and caring comes very easily for Hector.

I am torn because I have feelings for two people - I am deeply afraid of regret. I am afraid I will choose Hector and then think about how John is probably treating his next girl right, and she will get to live a prestigious and lavish lifestyle due to the money he brings in, despite me being the one who allowed John to progress on emotional exploration. However, I don't know how much ""trust"" John needs to see in me first before he can fully commit. If I choose John, then I would think about how loving Hector would also be so understanding and loving of his next partner. Hector would also introduce his new partner into the friend group and that is something I'd have to live with. Please provide any insight and guidance you have, now knowing this situation. If you were in my shoes, who would you choose?",1,1742925497.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1jjpowk,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jjpowk/breville_bambino_plus_or_profitec_go_first/,Breville Bambino (/Plus) or Profitec Go | First Machine [$1600 CAD],"Hey folks! I've seen similar discussions before but hoping to get a little more insight than what's currently available.

Over the past few years I have honed and dialled in and upgraded my pour over setup, and am now looking to enter the world of home espresso.

Much research and rabbit holes later, I've narrowed it down to two machines at pretty significantly different price points.

**The Breville Bambino (/Plus) vs. the Profitec Go.**

A few notes on the discussion I'm hoping to have and what I'm hoping to learn :)

* I'd love to focus on specifically these two machines
* I'm not particularly looking to litigate Bambino vs. Bambino Plus
* **Ultimately, I want to go ""good enough"" (\~75% ?) toward a great shot for the least $$ possible**

**In the Bambino's corner:**

* Dramatically lower price for the machine (and I am likely to grab certain third-party accessories regardless of machine, so that amount is mostly cancelled out)
* Pre-Infusion
* Small footprint
* ...mostly the price

**In the Go's corner:**

* Dramatically higher build quality
* Quality of espresso higher (if this is even true...and by how much?)
* Still a small footprint
* ...mostly the build quality

Now, I'm happy to make a sacrifice on some things in return for others. E.g., if the Bambino (/Plus) can make espresso at 80-90% the quality of the Go (and certainly if higher) then that would seriously point me in that direction. 

However, if it's dramatically worse espresso or I'd be majorly tempted to upgrade within a couple years anyway or it breaks often etc, then that would seriously point me toward the Go.

If it's helpful, I'll illustrate from some of my other hobbies what **good trade-offs** look like:

* Getting a Springbank 15 instead of a Springbank 21 = **good trade-off**
* Getting Johnnie Walker Red Label instead of a Springbank 21 = **bad trade-off**
* Getting a Weber kettle instead of a Masterbuilt Gravity Series = **good trade-off**
* Getting an indoor smoker (or using my oven) = **bad trade-off**

The good trade-offs represent ""good enough quality for the price"" as to justify the trade-off, whereas the bad trade-offs represent ""you should really pay for the better one.""

The Go is so much more money than the Bambinos that it makes it tough to justify at first blush - but I don't want to sacrifice the end result to the point that it doesn't make sense and I'll wish I had simply shelled out for the more expensive option.

Hope that illustrates my conundrum! Would appreciate any help I can get. Peace and love coffee friends.",1,1742925478.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

About 10 years ago (3-4 phones ago), I downloaded an app off a black market. It may have been on there for a hours. I didn't think much of it. But then my primary email at that time started getting so much spam/malicious emails. I had to stop using it but I was already transitioning to another email address anyways. 

That email address has never recovered. I have reset passwords and put mfa on etc. but it's still getting emails to this day. At least 5 a day. I don't use it. Emails are very similar and usually an image- ""You are a winner - {Name of company}"". It comes from different fake/hacked emails. 

What has now concerned me, is how accurate these company names are. Example: I recently was checking out Nespresso and coffee machines. Guess was appears... ""You are Winner -Nespresso"". Nearly all these emails are services I use or have used. 99% of them I used a different email address. Maybe it's coincidence but I don't like how it seems to getting thinks correct.

Disclaimer: I am a complete noob when it comes to NYC food but I tried to make a solid list based on stuff I saw on here (and also not trying way too hard to get Resys at the insanely tough to get spots)  


1. Doughnut Plant - Grand Central - Starving from the 5 hour flight and needed anything. Coffee was solid and the Coffee Cake donut was great (though not as fresh as I would like but it was like 3pm) 8/10
2. Piccola Cucina Uptown - Arancini - incredible texture and flavor - 9/10
3. Piccola Cucina Uptown - Ravioli di ossobuco - some of the best pasta I've ever had (limited as my experience may be in the realm of well-made authentic pasta) it had an al dente bite that I had never had before. Great flavor profile / wish the ossobuco shone through a touch more - 9/10
4. Levain Bakery (OG location) - Lemon Cake and Dark Choc Chip - the cake was fluffy and incredible and the cookie insanely dense but perfectly cooked - 10/10
5. Lucia Pizza UES - Sicilian Pep / Funghi / Papa Leone - Crust, sauce was perfect on the two regular slices. Flavor and crust was very good on the sicilian but it was a bit overcooked to my taste when it came to the crust. Too charred and inedibly hard but otherwise great. 9.5/10
6. Monkey Bar - King Crab Rangoon - great flavor and fried to perfection but wish the actual crab was more apparent in the bite (too pureed for me) - 8.5/10
7. Monkey Bar - Wagyu Burger (w/ Bacon) and side of Truffle Mac - The mac was pretty great. The burger had me feeling a bit underwhelmed, especially at the price. I have had some insanely good burgers for half that price that I've left dreaming of. This was not that. The bacon was far too fatty to enjoy with the burger itself and the burger had too much gristle inside for my taste. All in all was disappointed with how much we paid for all of this after it being hyped pretty high. 7/10
8. Pommes Frites - Pommes Frites w/ truffle mayo, war sauce and curry ketchup - Incredible 11/10
9. Joes Pizza (Carmine St.) - For a pizza spot at 3am this was a solid pair of slices - 8/10
10. Russ and Daughters - Lox Bagel with scallion cream cheese, tomato, capers and onions - our first bagel in the city and it lived up to all the hype, great textures and freshness all around - 10/10
11. Frena - Terra Cotta Lamb, Shishito Peppers, Frena Bread (not pictured) - The flavors and presentation of every single thing we had here were firing on all cylinders. 10/10
12. Frena - Knafeh - I had never had this before and was blown away by the flavors at play here with the texture of the dish itself. 10/10
13. Librae - Pistachio Rose Croissant - Great flavor and texture but wish I had gotten a fresher/warmer one 9/10
14. Librae - Sesame Banana Danish - loveddddd this - 10/10
15. La Cabra - Cardamom Bun - Impeccable presentation aside, the flavors and bite of this bun were so damn good - 10/10
16.  Tompkins Square Bagels - BEC on Plain (don't come for me for how basic this order is... I panicked) great texture on the bagel itself and the BEC was cooked perfectly. Hindsight should have gotten a more intriguing order but that's on me. (and yea i saw all the posts about not getting a BEC on anything but a roll...) 9.9/10
17. Mei Lei Wah - Pineapple Pork Bun - Worth the chaos, incredible flavor profile and was super fresh - 11/10
18. Maxi Noodle - Curry Fish Balls - I was pretty full but wanted to try something from here, the flavor on these were solid! - 9/10
19. Rubirosa - Half TieDye Half Rubirosa Supreme - What can I say that hasnt already been said. Incredible pie with super thin crust that I assume is so much better fresh than delivered. Great vibe inside too. 10/10
20. Liberty Bagel - Bacon egg and pork roll on a jalapeno bagel - purists leave me alone once again, this was an awesome combo. 10/10",18,1742925147.0,FoodNYC,14,0.95,False

We‚Äôre Jamaican so rice is huge for us. When we were younger we would eat what we wanted but every single day we would dance together .. as we got older and started focusing on other things we slowly stopped dancing so being active wasn‚Äôt really happening outside of work .

Diabetes runs in our family but what she ended up doing even with her being pregnant is simply drinking more water and cutting out the coffees and energy drinks. I know this journey looks different for all of us. Sometimes it‚Äôs the small things we need to change instead of making drastic changes. Last month I ended up being told I‚Äôm pre diabetic (5.8) as well and I‚Äôm the health NUT of the family.. of course I was shooketh so started getting back to movement . So what I learned is get back to the things that you used to do as your younger self . Me and my sisters was dance. She‚Äôs not active outside of walking a lot at work but she‚Äôs made minor adjustments with her diet and still eats what she wants and it went down from 6.7 to 5.6 (while pregnant) as of yesterday. So I‚Äôve been wrecking my brain trying to eat little to no carbs when my diet was never even bad.. but I‚Äôve gained a healthy habit of walking more and actually not taking my extra time for granted and started working out daily .

i‚Äôm a 20yo college student. i have struggled with anxiety, depression, and adhd since i was a kid. i stopped taking medication for depression about two years ago, and for a while i really thought i was doing much better. but over the past several months to a year, i have been doing much much worse, in a way i can only describe as inconsistent and completely random. 

now, i wake up every day feeling like a different person than the one who fell asleep in my bed the night before. two days ago, i was wholly in love with myself and the life i was living. i spent my morning dancing to al green and etta james with my coffee, i was active and engaged in my class discussions, and my shift that night in the restaurant i work at was spent joking around with my coworkers, listening to loud music, and just generally being really overly happy and content with my life, all the while feeling like a greek god with a physique sculpted from marble. 

and now i fucking hate myself again. no warning. i woke up today and the first thought through my head was that i wished i hadn‚Äôt. i don‚Äôt have any particular reason for it at all, and i couldn‚Äôt even tell you what it is about myself that makes me feel so pathetic. but i just feel numb. like i‚Äôve never felt happiness before and i‚Äôll never feel it again. i‚Äôve been awake for like three hours and i‚Äôve already had a panic attack and a half. and the only way i‚Äôve learned to (poorly) manage my panic attacks is thrash metal, punching and slapping myself, and putting out cigarettes on my arms. and not to mention, i‚Äôve spent the last several months heavily addicted to weed. i haven‚Äôt smoked in about two weeks and im finally starting to not crave it anymore, but i still miss it so bad because it lets me have a tiny little bit of control over my state of mind. but i don‚Äôt want to smoke. 

i‚Äôm starting therapy again this week, and my friends and girlfriend have been so so so supportive, and im so grateful to have them in my life. but all of the sudden, with no warning or reason at all, i can‚Äôt convince myself that im worthy of their time. 

im sorry to dump this on anybody unfortunate enough to have read this far. but nobody around me seems to really understand what im putting myself - and being put - through (how convenient, lol). so im really just curious if anyone else here has dealt with similar feelings, and what strategies they‚Äôve found helpful to deal with them.

My preference is to keep my sims in their own world as much as possible. Thanks to a great suggestion by a fellow simmer on how enhance that gameplay, I built a train station business as my first B&H project.

Sims can buy a ticket (one-time fee) at the train station, then read in the waiting room or buy a cup of coffee while they ""wait for their train."" This way travel to another world costs money and takes time (as much as I think is appropriate for the distance). Then on return, they travel to the train station rather than directly home.

The business owner is the station master, who lives in one wing of the building. His wife runs the cafe, and they hired another employee to clean up after the passengers, who leave cups and books all over the place.

The gameplay is working pretty well, with ""passengers"" reading in the waiting room or chatting with friends in the cafe. The station master and his wife have a tendency to go home at the most inappropriate times, or return to the station even after closing hours, but some of that is on me. I was more focused on fine-tuning the build than directing their actions. I set a few miniature trains out for sale, but no one bought them unless my station master wheedled them to do so (and took a reputation hit as a result).

Travelled the world together. Played sports together in HS. We were very close in our early years and not as close in our 30s but we still travelled together and talked often. 

My friend had his bachelor party in Miami where I live and his wedding in Santa Barbara, CA. I travelled across the country for his wedding. Spent a good amount of money to attend. 

I found out he had his bachelor party in Miami and did not contact me. I understand I am not a groomsman understandably so. But you are in the city where I live, I am attending your wedding, and we are friends. I would think he could call me to attend a dinner, have a coffee, or even to use my bathroom and to say hi (haha). Something. 

We had travelled to Vegas a year prior with a group of friends and he told us to not tell x,y,z about the wedding because they were not invited. He was trying to be secretive. 

Well I found out he was in Miami for his bachelor party and I found out through a tagged photo on instagram. 

I called him a year after this wedding and I confronted him about it. ‚ÄúMy friendship with you has not changed. I don‚Äôt look at us any differently. I did not plan my bachelor party.‚Äù

He kept saying‚Ä¶‚ÄùI did not plan the bachelor party. My friend did.‚Äù

I feel slighted. Am I overreacting? Is this odd behavior? Would you continue the friendship? Do I invite him to my wedding?

üìù ùóúùóªùó¥ùóøùó≤ùó±ùó∂ùó≤ùóªùòÅùòÄ :  
\- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  
\- 1 cup shelled pistachios, finely chopped  
\- 1 cup granulated sugar  
\- 1 teaspoon baking powder  
\- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda  
\- 1/2 teaspoon salt  
\- 3 large eggs  
\- 1/2 cup vegetable oil  
\- 1/2 cup plain yogurt  
\- 1/4 cup milk  
\- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  
\- Zest of 1 lemon  
  
Directions:  
1. Get that oven ready! Preheat it to a cozy 350¬∞F (175¬∞C) and give your loaf pan a little love by greasing and flouring it.  
  
2. Mix it up! In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, finely chopped pistachios, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt until they‚Äôre well blended.  
  
3. Combine the wet ingredients. In a separate bowl, beat the eggs until they‚Äôre fluffy. Then, gently stir in the vegetable oil, yogurt, milk, vanilla extract, and the zesty lemon peel. Mix until everything is nicely combined.  
  
4. Bring it all together. Pour those wet ingredients into the dry mix and stir until just combined. Don‚Äôt worry about perfection; a few lumps are totally okay!  
  
5. Time to bake! Pour the batter into your prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Pop it in the oven and let it bake for about 50-60 minutes. You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs ready when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean‚Äîa perfect golden delight!  
  
6. Cooling off. Once baked, let your loaf cool in the pan for about 10 minutes. Then, carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.  
  
7. Finishing touch! For a sweet drizzle, whisk together 1 cup of powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice until it‚Äôs smooth. Drizzle this lovely glaze over your cooled loaf and sprinkle some extra chopped pistachios on top for that final crunch!

Machine is six days old and cannot achieve stock flow rate of 12.8 grams per second. A bit of background...

I have the pump set to 9 bars with the flow control valve all the way open, and I achieve a maximum flow rate of 10.94 g/second. With the pump adjusted to 12 bars, I can increase the flow rate to just over 12.5 grams/second, which is still below the 'stock' flow rate and well below the maximum flow rate. I have been referencing this article (https://www.wholelattelove.com/blogs/support-articles/27779496695571?legacysupport=true). 

I have the new style flow control for the machine and have verified that I do have a full 270 degrees of rotation. 

The machine is not plumbed and is using the reservoir. The water used in the machine is filtered. 

I opened an issue ticket with WLL and they did a whole song and dance where I took a video of the machine running fully open with no porta filter for 20 seconds, and sure enough the rate was ~10.9 grams per second. After confirming the machine wasn't performing as expected, WLL requested I take apart the flow control parts and reassemble in the hopes that something was stuck. I had my doubts since I was able to use the full range of motion on flow control and water is able to be stopped with the lever, nonetheless I complied, and I'm glad I did...

Keep in mind this machine has been used for 6 days at this point and has only had coffee in it a handful of times, most of its use thus far has been flow testing...

I'm open to interpretation here, but after examining the parts it seems as though they are in quite poor shape despite being brand new. 
The most glaringly obvious issue here are the threads for the upper nut and jet. The jet is losing its surface and the bottom threads contained old, dirty grease. 
Also notice that some of the pieces are rusting and there is visible corrison. I live in Colorado and exclusively use water suitable for the machine which is filtered for minerals and scale causing substances. However, I find it hard to believe this would be built up over the course of six days of minimal use.

Definitely pretty confused and butt hurt because best case scenario I get this fixed in a month or so after sending it back.

Over the last 2-3 weeks, I have started to despise my job. I've always wanted to work in Marketing, but I'm actually miserable. The boss I once liked is getting more and more overbearing, and she is such a stickler for the rules that it's actually affecting my creativity and how I function at work. (EX: Can't use lowercase letters for a graphic because she doesn't like it OR have to clock in and can't be salaried like everyone else in the building and makes a big deal about making up hours in accordance with ""policy"" that NONE of the other departments follow). I work in a giant communal office that is dim and only has three small windows. In my last job at the same company, I was allowed to take my laptop and sit outside and work. As long as I got my work done, it didn't matter where I did it from. My current boss won't let me leave the office. Lunch breaks have to be an hour on the dot, and she even gets annoyed if you're in the bathroom too long. 

I feel stifled in my creativity, I always feel connected to my job, I hate coming to work to sit in this dim office, I hate that my boss won't give me any kind of freedom when she knows I can do my job and I do it well. To top it all off, my eyes are tired every day from staring at the computer my entire shift. I feel like I don't have any personal time for my husband, I don't have time to work on my hobbies because I'm so annoyed and tired after work, and I'm overall just miserable.

Just quit, then, you may say. Well, I can't. My husband and I were just given the opportunity to rent one of the houses my company owns. It's four bed, two bath, and it includes wifi and rent is only $550 a month. That's amazing. We were paying upwards of $1600 per month including utilities for a one bed, one bath crappy house for the past year, and payments were getting hard. But I have to work at the company in order to rent the new house. So, even though I'm miserable and feel like I'm wasting my life (I'm 24, I shouldn't be feeling this way), I can't leave. We're saving too much money for me to leave. Plus, my husband has to wait a year before we could move anywhere because he has to see if he gets into the grad program he's applying for. 

I don't know what to do. I made an appointment to see a counselor, something I never thought I'd do, and I have that this weekend. How am I supposed to do this job for a whole year when I feel like crying every day when I leave? It's affecting my whole life. I am grumpy at everyone, even people I love dearly like my husband and parents. The only time I feel somewhat like myself is the weekend, and even then, I'm so busy doing side jobs to make money, I barely have time to breath. Life is supposed to be about working to live, not living to work. I see marketing girlies sitting by the beach with their laptops, drinking coffee, and making a ton of money, and I know that's extreme, but I want to at least be able to open a freaking window or be able to work from home some days and not feel guilty if I ever have to take a sick day.

This can be performed during the same time as the turbinoplasty.'

1jjp31l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jjp31l,Ninja CFP301 Pod Adapter Not Detected,"I've had this Ninja CFP301 Coffee maker for about a year and a half.  Recently, it cannot detect when the K-Cup/Pod adapter is inserted.  When the adapter is inserted and the lid pulled forward, the machine lights up the three symbols shown in photo #1 (water drop, k-cup, coffee bean) as though the machine does not know what mode it is in.  While in this state, it will not allow any brewing/function to be used, and just beeps if I push in the dial. 

The pod adapter has worked in the past multiple times, and has only seen light use.  We usually use this as a drip coffee machine and rarely brew k-cups.  I rinse and dry the k-cup adapter after every use.  As far as I'm aware it's never been dropped or damaged.  

Sometimes if I leave the pod adapter in for a long time (like 15-20 minutes) the machine will eventually recognize it.  Whenever the machine recognizes that the pod adapter is inserted, k-cup brewing itself always worked fine.  

We use the machine almost daily as a drip coffee maker and sometimes to boil water for tea.  We've never had any problems with those other functions - only the pod adapter.  

I've tried googling the issue and can't really seem to find people with exactly the same issue.  Usually when someone can't get the adapter working, it's because the machine was left in water mode, or the lid on the adapter wasn't pulled fully forward.  I've seen some folks mention a magnet in the adapter that can fall out, but I think that may only be the case for other Ninja models (my pod adapter doesn't look like any of the screenshots I've seen, and I don't see anywhere on my unit that a magnet would have been). 

When I called Ninja support, they told me I needed a new pod adapter and it would be $45 since the unit is out of warranty.  I'm reluctant to just buy one though, as they couldn't explain why the issue is happened or really assure me that a new adapter would work.

1jjoz0d,https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/1jjoz0d/epiphany/,Epiphany,"Hello comrades. This is a long post, but I hope I made it worth the read. 


A little backstory. I became homeless due to a brain injury from an attempted murder. I had to teach myself to read and write all over again. Now it's my mission to let people know what it's like to be homeless in America. To be cast off by a capitalist society that has no use for you if you can't be, or refuse to be productive for the corporate fat cats. 



Without further ado, Epiphany.



 When you first become homeless it really takes a little while for your psyche to grasp the full scope of your situation. For a while, your mind will refuse to think it into reality. 



For a day or so, I kept thinking that as soon as someone caught the mistake, found where someone must have overlooked something, everything would get back to normal, and the manager would apologize.
 


Tomorrow morning, I'll wake up and start a pot of coffee. Then, I'll stand over the sink and stare out of the kitchen window for too long, thinking about it even looks cold out this morning. 



I'll wrap my robe up snug against the cold, put my old sneakers on, and walk out of the front door to the end of the driveway, taking time to breathe in the crisp cool air. I'll stop and the end of the driveway and take my time bending over to pick up the morning paper, making it a grander affair than need be. 



I'll open it with the sharp practiced snap of a news professional so I can give the headline a quick glance. I wanted a rundown of the news before I went back into the house, like I would be confronted and tested before I could get my coffee. 



I would search in vain for some sort of headline that change the course of my day, like, ""Aliens Attack Everywhere, And They Mean Business "" or ""Asteroid To Collide With Earth In About An Hour"". 



Seeing that the headlines were the same old lines from yesterday, and the yesterday before, about another billion dollar company thinking about opening another store in the area, or some major league manufacturing jobs were coming next year, or how they were shutting down the rec center and increasing budget for enforcement. Everythings subject to changes if a stiff breeze blows. 



I'll furrow my brow to feel as serious as possible as I slowly look up and down the street for a second or two, pausing for effect, like I always do. 'My turn at guard'. My morning duty to the community. 



I'll notice the Wornicks finally mowed their lawn yesterday and left grass clippings all over the road. They put that birdbath that my wife wants to run over there and clean in the front yard again. 



Looking over I'll see that old Mrs. Brackson forgot to pull her garbage to the road, so I'll walk over there, again, and wheel it to the curb even though I'm thinking I shouldn't after the way she hollered at the kids yesterday. 



In the quiet of the moment I'll be able to hear the humming of electricity in the lines above my head, then I'll turn around and quickly make my way back in and out of the cold and the Columbian warm aroma of my kitchen, pouring myself a cup, and standing over the heat vent I'll let the warmth envelope me. 



I'll know from routine that I have about twenty minutes left before time to wake up the boy and get him, cleaned up a tad, and properly pumped for a day of school. 



The thought of the love I have for my son will fire a flash of dopamine through my brain, and I'll react with a smile of contentment. 
 


Twenty-three years of rinse and repeat. Twenty-three. Rinse and repeat.
 


After a couple of days and it starts to sink in a little more, becoming realer, more tangible. 



Now you're wondering if that second cousin, the one you hated so much still lives in that big old house in, Whereverville. It doesn't matter, anyway. You wouldn't know where, or how to look for her. Your mom was the only one who ever really talked to her, and she hasn't been much help since she passed away. 



If you could just find a way to get a little re-start, some time to catch your breath, plant your feet before plowing forward again. 



In your imagination you keep seeing doorways that open to nothingness, a mirage to a desperate gold miner in the hot Nevada sun. Everyone evaporates as you try to reach for them.
 


You start to understand that this mistake would not be found. There would be no correction. There will be no managers refund or time put back on the clock.
 


The Day of My Epiphany, I was sitting in the back area of the local community college, where just two years earlier I had sat at the exact same picnic table and watched the Cape Fear River swirl and eddy for my enjoyment while I relaxed over lunch between classes. 



In those days, I worried about Algebra. At that time, my biggest concern was if I could get my homework done before dinner so I could hang out with everyone before time we went to bed. 



Sometimes, when I would carry my son to bed, I would be listening as his grumbling morphed its way into soft snores, head back, safe and no concern in the world. 



Would I be able to stay awake long enough to see my favorite show that night? 
 


I thought back about those concerns, realizing more and more that my concerns now had turned to a much more serious nature than any television show that I couldn't even remember now. 
 


All the times over the last couple of days I had been wanting and hoping that this was all a dream, some nightmare that I would wake from and shake off. When the real truth was that my past life had been the dream all along, I had woken into this harsh, cold reality. I once sat staring at the river, and now I was staring into it.
 


My brain was exhausted from constantly trying to either reason this situation away or make some sense of how I got there. 



No one was going to walk by and think that I had any potential. An unrecognizable feeling washed over me, drenching me, as sure as it had been poured from a bucket. The wind felt crisper, colder, and every little sound became louder and clearer.
 


The city sidewalks were busy, and every noise was foreign, undistinguished from all the others. An auditory blur. Emotions were threatening to well up from a part of my stomach that felt empty and flat upon itself.



I was alone, totally alone, and none of the faces that I could see appeared to be sympathetic in the least. No friendlies in sight. Desolation.
 


I wanted to tell someone, just call them up, get some advice from Pops, but I couldn't think of anyone I could call, and Pops had fielded his last question. What would I even say? What would I ask?



I was so numb by the acknowledgment that I didn't even notice the first few tears. When I did notice, it took me a bit too long to turn them off. I once did it so easily, before. Dad strong for the family. A life so far away, an alien world or distant dream. Or maybe just something in the corner of my eye. 
 


I noticed that the dirty blanket draped over my shoulders had lost the battle to keep me warm hours ago, just like it had lost the battle to stay raveled at some point.
 


It wasn't long before I started to recognize, spot the social cues, the little and not so little clues people give you. Some to let you know that you are not a friend they haven't met, but rather a blight they would like to avoid. 



Strangers no longer nodded their heads with a smile of quiet salutations when I passed walking on the sidewalk. I couldn't remember the last time someone actually smiled or spoke. 



I started to notice the ladies who clutched their bags tight against their bodies, then I realized that it was because of me, not some danger that I didn't recognize or couldn't see. People now thought that I was the danger. Me. From most trusted to checking to see if the revolver is loaded.
 


My view of the world started changing as well, piece by piece, bit by bit, perception by perception. Instead of being my outgoing gregarious self, I attempted to become invisible, to fade into the background of the streets around me. I had to become something that I wasn't.
 


Those first couple of days, I wandered a lot. Confused, disheveled, and stunned looking for places that I could hide and maybe try to sleep, just maybe catch a nap, just blink for a little longer. 



I had never been so exhausted. I would have never dreamed of being so exhausted. I only got to sleep when sleep overtook me. Sitting on a bench or picnic table somewhere. Nowhere comfortable, of course.
 


It didn't take long for me to see that I wasn't allowed to get comfortable. I had no idea before becoming homeless just how offensive sleeping is to the general public. Never knew anybody who felt traumatized by seeing someone asleep. 



It occurred to me that I could sit at any bench with my underwear on my head while singing crude sailor songs as long as I didn't fall asleep.



Another law passed one day when some legislator saw a man asleep on a bench and thought that mans existence to be unsightly. 
 


People shooing me away, playing loud music, putting up no loitering or trespassing signs, segmented benches, and spikes in the sidewalks to keep us away from the safest places to sleep. I now belonged to a social class that wasn't allowed to rest. 



It had never dawned on me before, the lengths companies go through to deprive the homeless of sleep. If I slept over three or four hours I would wake up in a panic about where I was. Was anyone looking?
 


All the things I had taken for granted through the years, the ability to rest on a regular basis, on schedule most every time never really crossed my mind. Now I moved on auto pilot. Trying to avoid any obstacles or not to run any red lights. Cruise control until the gas just runs out. 



So many things to were no longer even options on the homeless menu. 



When I felt hungry, I couldn't just walk into a store and get food or slide through the drive thru in secret an hour dinner. I rarely even got to choose my own dinner. I couldn't just get in the shower or throw my clothes in the washer, or even get myself a glass of water. 



No matter how exhausted or sleepy I was, I had nowhere comfortable or even safe to grab some quick shut eye. Eight hours had become some abstract illusion. 



Even the very call of nature now required planning and execution. Instead of closing the door and locking it, I had to wonder if my position was concealed enough. There are no provisions in the law for ""I simply couldn't hold it anymore.""
 


When I realized that my very biological functions were now under scrutiny and under threat of arrest, the delusions that had been propping me up began to crumble and fall. None of my family would magically come back to life and reach out to me, no one was going to talk to me, think I was special, that I didn't belong here and escort me down to a path of prosperity. 



I wasn't going to suddenly remember the phone number of a friend that might help a brother out. No cavalry is coming in the nick of time. 
 


Sitting at that picnic table, staring at the Cape Fear River, it finally came to me that no one was going to find the mistake because there had been no mistake. Just an unfortunate compilation of tragic events coming to its ultimate conclusion. 



The winds of fate had swept me up and deposited me here, and most importantly, here I was.

""Did I capture the magic of my culture in this form of art?"" Pepper sits down next to me and looks at her own art, admiring her work.

""I've never seen anything like this before. It's almost like it's a photograph taken. You have all of these Fae just flying, working, and loving. You have this whole society in the woods living without the pressures of modern man. It seems like it's so peaceful."" I sit back and set the artwork down with a sigh. What an interesting life that would be, free of technology and the hardships of humanity.

""It's not what it's cracked up to be. There are many instances of infighting, hatred, and famine. Magic can only get us so far, it's not an all-powerful wish-granting artwork. Magic has many limits, and it's not used in every aspect of our lives. We make the most with what we have in nature and rely on physical work with the assistance of our magic. Nothing is as cut and dry as in the fairy tales your kind has created."" Pepper scoots near waist-to-waist with me on the couch and fiddles with the TV remote in her hand. Taking the back cover off and staring at the batteries. It must be quite a foreign concept to her. Tiny pieces of metal capable of providing power to nearly anything with varying sizes.

""How did you even come to learn human English?"" I turn my head toward her.

""For one, my village sits in the woods nearby. We see and hear dozens of humans every day. We pick up on your social cues and words. For example, we take in the tones and emotions behind the words and phrases you have, such as those of your animal pets. I also found the piece of literature you call a magazine lying around. It had so much information, so many examples of your technology, and so many people with names connected to monetary gain. It was one of the main reasons I decided to approach human society. It's also a cold winter, so your apartment window was unlocked, and you had the easiest access to shelter."" She flips the batteries around in her fingers as she speaks.

""What about your sudden growth spurt last night? You went from 2 feet tall to 4 feet tall."" I rub my eyes a bit as the trip to the store this morning and the lack of coffee hit me.

""We're only so small because we live in nature. I supposed being away from home has cut my connection to nature and I've reverted to a side mode suited for human society. I haven't lost my connection with magic, though that is a relief. It's everywhere, just more concentrated in some places than others.""

""Could I learn magic? If it's everywhere, humans must have some ability for it, right?"" My brain gets to thinking about the possibilities of getting access to magic. Such a thing could make life a bit easier.

""It is possible for humans to learn magic. But you have such erratic thoughts by nature. I'll have to guide you through meditation if you even wish to start the journey toward magic."" She gets up and plops down on my lap without warning.

""I don't see why you have to sit on my lap for this."" I adjust my posture on the couch to make it less awkward.

""It's normal for us to do this in my culture. Especially for our young or those new to magic. Don't worry, I'm around the age range as you in human years. Now close your eyes."" She puts my hand on her hand, her antennae twitching between my fingers.

""Whatever you say."" I close my eyes and get comfortable, keeping a soft grip on her head.

""Now breathe in, and then out. Repeat that until all thoughts are out of your head. Just follow my voice."" She closes her eyes as well.

I breathe in and out for a few minutes before my mind goes blank. After a short while, a warm feeling travels through my body. I crack an eye open to see a blue glow coming from Pepper before I quickly shut my eye and clear my thoughts.

""Now, keep your composure and stay still. This will feel...intimate."" She gives me a short warning before my head vibrates.

For the next 15 minutes all I can see are her own memories. I can only assume she's seeing all my memories as well. Oh, god, so many messed up moments. I can rapidly see her own life through her lives at a high speed. Birth, child, teen, adult, all of the thoughts and emotions through all of it. I didn't expect this form of intimacy.

""Good, now keep your eyes closed a while longer."" She keeps my hands on her head, and that glow flashes again. I can see an array of colors.

I focus on controlled breathing and observe these colors. Red, green, blue, yellow, and even colors I've never seen before. This is kind of like mana, but also not mana. It's some interconnected energy that flows through everything. Humans have observed particles and atoms. But what if they saw this? This changes everything I know.

I breathe out as the visions fade. My head feels a bit light, it was just poked and prodded. Man, our memories must be entangled in our brains now, it's so confusing separating mine and hers.

""Now open your eyes; there's only one last step."" I open my eyes and see her staring at me. She grabs my cheeks and leans in close.

1jjoues,https://i.redd.it/pjxjx8h4evqe1.jpeg,Metropia‚Äôs Shampoo as a Smartphone Metaphor,"Could the mind-controlling shampoo from Metropia (2009) be a stand-in for smartphones, especially looking at where we are in 2025? This isn‚Äôt about conspiracy theories or saying the filmmakers were prophets. It‚Äôs about exploring whether this weird dystopian shampoo could mirror how smartphones have evolved into tools that shape our lives in ways we don‚Äôt always notice.

For anyone who hasn‚Äôt seen Metropia, it‚Äôs a 2009 animated film set in a gloomy 2024 Europe where oil‚Äôs gone, the economy‚Äôs tanked, and everyone‚Äôs plugged into a massive underground metro system run by the shady Trexx Corporation. Trexx floods the market with Dangst shampoo, which seems innocent enough. Everyone‚Äôs washing their hair with it. But there‚Äôs a catch. The shampoo‚Äôs laced with organic nanobots that seep into your scalp, turn your hair into antennae, and link your brain to an AI system that monitors and controls your thoughts. The main character, Roger, starts hearing voices, figures out he‚Äôs being puppeteered, and tries to break free. It‚Äôs dark, surreal, and low-key brilliant, but it didn‚Äôt get much buzz. The shampoo‚Äôs the big hook here. An everyday product turned into a dystopian weapon.

What if Dangst isn‚Äôt literal shampoo but a metaphor for smartphones? When Metropia came out in 2009, the iPhone 3GS was brand new, Android was barely a thing, and nobody was doomscrolling TikTok yet. Smartphones were handy gadgets, not the all-seeing, all-knowing lifelines they are now. Here in 2025, though, they‚Äôre borderline extensions of our bodies. Tracking our steps, our moods, our secrets. Could the film have been riffing on the idea of a ubiquitous consumer item becoming a Trojan horse for surveillance and influence?

In Metropia, Dangst is the only shampoo you can buy. It‚Äôs not a choice. It‚Äôs just what‚Äôs there, and people lather up without a second thought. Smartphones are at that level of saturation. As of 2023, Statista pegs global smartphone ownership at over 6.6 billion users. Roughly 85% of the planet. In 2025, that‚Äôs climbed higher as cheaper models flood markets like India and Africa. They‚Äôre not optional anymore. You need one for work, banking, even unlocking your car in some cases. Like shampoo, they‚Äôve become a daily ritual. Wake up, check your phone, repeat. We don‚Äôt stop to wonder what‚Äôs happening behind the screen, just like Roger didn‚Äôt question his shampoo until it was too late.

Dangst‚Äôs nanobots spy on your thoughts and relay them to Trexx. That‚Äôs sci-fi territory, but smartphones in 2025 pull off a lighter version of that trick. They‚Äôre already loaded with tech that watches us. Cameras catch our faces, mics pick up our voices, GPS logs our every move. That‚Äôs leveled up now. Take eye-tracking: companies like Tobii have been refining it for years, and it‚Äôs not crazy to think phone cameras map where you‚Äôre looking to gauge interest or mood. Microphones analyze tone. Siri and Alexa can guess if you‚Äôre mad or not. Apps harvest ambient noise without you knowing. Back in 2013, Snowden blew the lid off PRISM, showing how the NSA tapped into phone data. In 2025, with better AI and faster networks, that kind of monitoring is routine for governments or corporations. It‚Äôs not brain-reading, but it‚Äôs a hell of a lot of insight into who we are.

The shampoo in Metropia uses hair as a conduit. Nanobots hitch a ride through your follicles to your brain. It‚Äôs a wild leap, but smartphones have their own physical intimacy. They‚Äôre always on us. Tucked in pockets, pressed to our ears, or inches from our faces as we scroll. They‚Äôre scanning our fingerprints and faces to unlock, and in 2025, biometric tech‚Äôs gotten weirder. Gait analysis, tracking how you walk via accelerometers, is already in research labs. Companies like Affectiva push facial recognition to read micro-expressions. There‚Äôs even talk of sweat sensors in wearables hitting phones, picking up stress hormones. It‚Äôs not hair-as-antennae, but it‚Äôs a device that‚Äôs physically tied to us, collecting data from our bodies in ways we barely notice.

Here‚Äôs where it gets creepy, Dangst doesn‚Äôt just eavesdrop. It controls Roger, planting thoughts and steering his actions. Smartphones aren‚Äôt there yet, but they‚Äôre dabbling in influence. Algorithms on YouTube or Instagram keep you hooked with endless loops of content, tweaking what you see based on your habits. In 2025, AI refines that further. Say, picking up that you‚Äôre anxious from your typing speed and feeding you calming videos, or pushing ads that exploit your mood. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 showed how Facebook data, often grabbed via phones, swayed voters. Not by forcing them, but by shaping what they saw. It‚Äôs softer than Metropia‚Äôs mind control, but it‚Äôs a nudge that feels personal and hard to resist.

This film seems a but like predictive programming. 
Basically, the idea that movies, shows, or books can slip future ideas into the public‚Äôs head, softening us up for when they happen. It‚Äôs not about secret cabals. It‚Äôs more like media reflecting anxieties or trends that later come true. The Simpsons gets flak for ‚Äúpredicting‚Äù stuff like Trump‚Äôs presidency, and Black Mirror feels like a tech demo for today‚Äôs nightmares. Metropia, hitting theaters in 2009, landed just before smartphones exploded. Could it have been laying groundwork for a world where everyday tech doubles as a leash? Here in 2025, with phones tracking our emotions or feeding us curated realities, the shampoo metaphor looks less absurd. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt intentional, but it tapped into a vibe that‚Äôs only grown louder since.

5G‚Äôs fully deployed now. Ericsson predicted over 60% global coverage by end of 2025. 6G‚Äôs already in labs. That‚Äôs lightning-fast data and the ability to connect billions of devices, from phones to fridges. For surveillance, it‚Äôs a dream: real-time uploads of your location, voice clips, even health stats from wearables, all seamless and invisible. The metro in Metropia tied everyone together physically. 5G does it digitally. AI‚Äôs scary-smart at crunching data, with algorithms that don‚Äôt just track what you like but predict what you‚Äôll do next. Companies like Google and Meta pour billions into this. Imagine an AI that sees you‚Äôre tired from your slower swipes and serves up a coffee ad. It‚Äôs not thought control, but it‚Äôs a step toward steering your day. Neuralink‚Äôs pushing brain-computer interfaces, tiny implants that could help paralyzed folks move again. DARPA‚Äôs N3 program wants neural links without surgery, and startups test headsets that read brainwaves for gaming. Phones won‚Äôt plug into your skull, but external sensors pick up signals, like stress or focus, now. Metropia‚Äôs shampoo might exaggerate it, but the idea of tech brushing up against our minds isn‚Äôt pure fantasy anymore. AR glasses or phone overlays are practically mainstream in 2025. Pair that with generative AI, and your phone crafts hyper-real content just for you, like a fake video of a friend saying something they didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not controlling your brain, but it‚Äôs shaping your reality, which feels close to Metropia‚Äôs vibe.

With Cambridge Analytica (2018), sucked data from Facebook via smartphones to help build voter profiles, then targeted people with ads to nudge their choices in the 2016 election. It wasn‚Äôt hypnosis, but it proved phones could be pipelines for influence on a massive scale.  NSO Group‚Äôs Pegasus can hijack a phone with one text. Cameras, mics, texts, all fair game. It‚Äôs hit journalists and activists hard. In 2025, cheaper versions spread, making phone-based spying even stealthier. It‚Äôs Trexx-level surveillance, just without the shampoo bottle. Since 2014, China‚Äôs been testing a system that tracks citizens via phones and cameras, scoring them on behavior. Miss a payment or jaywalk? Your phone might lock you out of train tickets. It‚Äôs not mind control, but it‚Äôs tech enforcing compliance. Metropia-adjacent for sure. Apps like Affectiva and Beyond Verbal use phone cameras or mics to read your mood for marketing. In 2025, this is standard. Your phone knows you‚Äôre sad and pushes a playlist or ad to match. It‚Äôs subtle, but it‚Äôs a taste of what Dangst does outright.

So as not to oversell this, Dangst is a blunt tool. Trexx beams commands straight into your head. Smartphones, even in 2025, don‚Äôt do that. They‚Äôre more like a trade-off: we get maps, memes, and Zoom; they get our data. It‚Äôs not a one-sided takeover. Also, Metropia pins everything on one product, but real-world surveillance is messier. Phones, smart TVs, Alexa, Ring cameras. It‚Äôs a network, not a single villain. And unlike Roger, most of us aren‚Äôt fighting back. We shrug and keep scrolling, trading privacy for ease. The metaphor‚Äôs not airtight, but it still sparks something worth consideration.

In 2025, what if your phone isn‚Äôt just collecting data but actively crafting your world? Picture generative AI building a fake memory. Like a video of your kid‚Äôs first steps, tweaked to sell you something. Or haptic feedback, vibrations or heat, guiding your choices without you clocking it. Maybe 5G lets it sync with your smart home, dimming lights or playing sounds to mess with your headspace. The ‚Äúvoices‚Äù Roger hears could be AI assistants or deepfake calls nudging you along. It‚Äôs not shampoo, but it‚Äôs a device we trust turning into something we can‚Äôt fully control.

I don‚Äôt think that Metropia was a grand plan to prep us for smartphone dystopia. It‚Äôs too niche, too artsy. But it‚Äôs eerie how it landed right before the iPhone era kicked off. Maybe it just caught the undercurrent of unease about tech and corporate power. Here in 2025, with phones reading our faces or tweaking our feeds to keep us hooked, it feels like a warning worth revisiting. Not a blueprint, but a vibe check that‚Äôs aging better than expected.",1,1742923404.0,SocialEngineering,1,1.0,False

Start by signing up at [Make](https://honeysyed.com/make) (formerly Integromat). Once you‚Äôre in, create a new scenario. Make is like a blank canvas for automation magic. Click the little ‚Äú+‚Äù and drop in Gmail. You‚Äôll either choose ‚ÄúWatch Emails‚Äù to monitor new ones as they come in or ‚ÄúSearch Emails‚Äù if you want to pull from existing messages. Connect your Gmail with a few clicks. OAuth handles the handshake.

Now you tell Gmail what to look for. Maybe it‚Äôs your Inbox. Maybe a label like ‚ÄúInvoices.‚Äù Drop in a search query like filename:pdf invoice. Set the schedule so Make checks every 10 minutes. Boom. Your digital assistant is now on duty.

Want to make sure it‚Äôs only touching actual invoices? Add a filter. Just click the line between modules and say: only proceed if the attachment name ends in .pdf.

Next, tell it where to put the goods. Add a Google Drive module (or Dropbox, OneDrive, FTP or whatever your flavor is). Map the attachment data from Gmail into the file upload fields. Set the target folder like ‚ÄúInvoices‚Äù and Make will slide those PDFs right in there like a pro.

Now for the fun part‚Äîtest it. Hit ‚ÄúRun once‚Äù and fire a test email with a PDF. Check your Drive. Is the file there? Perfect. If not, dig into the logs. [Make](https://honeysyed.com/make) shows you step-by-step what happened.

Once it‚Äôs humming, turn it on and let it ride. Set the schedule and activate the scenario. From now on, your invoices will magically appear in your chosen folder without you lifting a finger.

And if you‚Äôre syncing Google Drive to your computer, guess what? Those invoices land on your desktop like clockwork.

Set it once. Never touch it again. Welcome to inbox freedom.",1,1742923403.0,AiChampions,0,1.0,False

## Why Choose Reed Diffuser Oils? The Enduring Appeal

Before diving into‚Å¢ specific brands and scents, let's understand why reed diffuser ‚Äåoils have maintained their popularity.‚Äç Unlike candles,‚Äã which ‚Äçrequire constant supervision, ‚Å§or electric diffusers, which rely on power outlets, ‚Å£reed diffusers offer a ‚Å¢passive and ‚Äåcontinuous fragrance release. The reeds, typically made of rattan, absorb the ‚Äçoil and gradually release the scent‚Äå into the air through evaporation. This makes them ideal for bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, and even‚Å¢ office spaces.

Moreover, reed diffusers‚Äå offer a level of customization that other methods frequently enough lack.‚Äã You can control the intensity‚Å§ of the‚Å¢ fragrance ‚Äçby‚Äã adjusting the number ‚Å¢of reeds used and the frequency with which you flip them.This adaptability is especially valuable for those with sensitivities to strong scents or those ‚Äåwho prefer a more subtle aroma. The longevity of a reed diffuser is ‚Äãanother meaningful advantage. High-quality reed ‚Äãdiffuser oils can last for weeks or even months, providing a consistent fragrance experience without the need for constant refills.

## Understanding Different Types of Reed Diffuser‚Å¢ Oils: A ‚ÄçDeep Dive

Navigating the world of reed diffuser oils can be confusing, with various terms like ""fragrance ‚Å§oil,"" ""essential oil,"" and ""aromatherapy oil"" frequently used. Understanding the distinctions between‚Å£ these types is crucial ‚Å£for making an informed purchase.

**1. Fragrance ‚ÄãOils:** These are synthetic ‚Å¢oils created in a laboratory to mimic natural scents or create entirely new fragrances. They often contain a blend of synthetic aroma‚Å¢ compounds and carriers.

*   **Pros:**‚Äç fragrance oils offer a wider ‚Å¢range of scent‚Å£ possibilities, including complex and unique blends that may not‚Å£ be achievable with‚Å£ natural essential oils. ‚ÄãThey ‚Äçcan‚Å£ also be more‚Å¢ cost-effective and tend ‚Å¢to ‚Å£have a longer shelf life.
* ‚Å£  **Cons:** Fragrance oils lack the therapeutic benefits associated‚Äå with essential oils. Some‚Å£ individuals may be sensitive‚Äã to certain synthetic ingredients,leading to allergic reactions or headaches.‚Å§ When‚Å§ choosing fragrance oils, look for those labeled as ""phthalate-free""‚Äç to minimize potential health risks.

**2. Essential Oils:** These are natural oils extracted from plants through methods like steam distillation or cold pressing. Each essential oil possesses a unique chemical composition that contributes to its distinct‚Äã aroma and therapeutic properties.

*  ‚Äå **Pros:** Essential oils offer a‚Å¢ wide range of potential‚Å§ benefits,‚Äç including stress reduction, improved sleep, enhanced focus, and mood elevation. ‚Å¢They are a ‚Å§natural and lasting option for home ‚Äçfragrance.
*   **Cons:** ‚Å£Essential oils can be more expensive than fragrance oils. Some essential oils might potentially be irritating to the skin or mucous membranes, so‚Å£ it's critically important to use them with‚Äç caution and ‚Äãdilute them‚Å¢ properly. The scent selection ‚Äçis also limited to the available‚Äå natural sources.

**3. Aromatherapy Reed Diffuser Oils:** These are specifically formulated blends of essential oils designed to promote specific therapeutic effects. They often combine multiple essential oils that work synergistically to achieve a desired ‚Äåoutcome.

*   **Pros:** Aromatherapy blends‚Äç offer a convenient way to experience the benefits of multiple essential oils ‚Å¢in a single product, such ‚Äåas ‚Äãrelaxation ‚Å¢for sleep or ‚Å§energy and focus for work.*   **Cons:** The effectiveness of aromatherapy blends can vary depending on individual sensitivities‚Å£ and the quality ‚Å¢of the essential‚Å£ oils used. It's crucial to choose‚Äã blends from reputable brands that prioritize purity and potency.

**4. Natural Reed Diffuser oils:** These are oils that are either pure essential oils or fragrance ‚Äåoils‚Äã that are derived from natural sources. They ‚Å§are usually made with ‚Äãplant-based‚Äç carriers and are ‚Äçless likely to contain harmful chemicals. ‚Å£they are a good‚Å¢ middle-ground if you like the variety of scent of fragrance oils, but are ‚Äåwary‚Äå of chemicals.

When selecting reed diffuser ‚Äåoils, consider your priorities: are you primarily seeking a pleasant aroma, or are‚Å¢ you interested in the therapeutic benefits of essential oils? If you're opting for fragrance oils, prioritize ‚Å£those from reputable‚Äç brands that disclose their ingredients and adhere to safety standards. If you're choosing essential oils or aromatherapy blends, look for certifications like ‚Äå""Certified Organic"" or ‚Å£""Therapeutic Grade"" ‚Å§to ensure ‚Å§quality and ‚Å£purity.It's always advisable to perform a patch test‚Äç before using any new‚Å£ reed diffuser oil to check for‚Å£ potential allergic reactions.

In full transparency, it‚Äôs for weight loss, skin improvement, money saving and time to really develop a conscious awareness of the kind of relationship I‚Äôd like to have with food, once eating again.

I started the fast having eaten:
- a small salad of vegetables, olive oil, chickpeas and kidney beans
- a tin of salmon
- some dark chocolate
- a few eggs, scrambled

(My usual diet consists of this, oatmeal, kimchi, additional protein, and the occasional pack of crisps or sweet. More or less to suit the fasting pattern.)

For prep and longevity, I‚Äôve got:
- plain table salt
- [dissolvable electrolyte tablets](https://HIGH5ZEROElectrolyteTablet-...https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B08XKQK5TH?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share), and [pill forms](https://amzn.eu/d/2phZrVf) covering other possible deficiencies
- herbal tea, coffee and available fresh fruit/juice if I need to emergency quit

So far, my context is:
- 16:8 for 5+ years, transitioning to regular OMAD with/without an evening snack over these past 2 years, and occasional ADFs for the past 1 year, roughly

I drink a lot of water, pay attention to my body, and don‚Äôt over-exercise. My current form is:
- taking naps if needed
- walking around 2000-8000 steps a day, but never pushing to, just whatever happens, happens as long as it doesn‚Äôt exceed 8000/overexertion
- getting up and sitting down slowly
- jotting down daily updates of my body‚Äôs behaviour and changes

I‚Äôve had some chills, a small bout of subtle nausea, some occasional quick electric zaps in my body, and general low energy during this initial phase. Once the 72hr threshold hits, I‚Äôm assuming things will smoothen out in the energy sense (do correct if I‚Äôm incorrect).

My hunger levels are less overall, especially after the first dissolvable tablets.

I‚Äôm >!22, F, 150lbs, 5‚Äô6‚Äù!<, for reference. I keep possible disordered thinking or risk on high alert, and recently took a blood test to rule out any initial deficiencies. The only one of note was inclination to low iron‚Äîwould taking an iron supplement per day/few days be enough for this?",0,1742923070.0,intermittentfasting,3,0.29,False

Thanks to a great suggestion by u/bee_of_doom I built a train station business as my first B&H project.

Sims can buy a ticket (one-time fee) at the train station, then read in the waiting room or buy a cup of coffee while they ""wait for their train."" This way travel to another world costs money and takes time (as much as I think is appropriate for the distance). Then on return, they travel to the train station rather than directly home.

The business owner is the station master, who lives in one wing of the building. His wife runs the cafe, and they hired another employee to clean up after the passengers, who leave cups and books all over the place.

The gameplay is working pretty well, with ""passengers"" reading in the waiting room or chatting with friends in the cafe. The station master and his wife have a tendency to go home at the most inappropriate times, or return to the station even after closing hours, but some of that is on me. I was more focused on fine-tuning the build than directing their actions. I set a few miniature trains out for sale, but no one bought them unless my station master wheedled them to do so (and took a reputation hit as a result).

first few days were hell. like actual hell. my stomach wouldn't stop screaming at me. jumping rope while fasted felt like some kind of medieval torture. but around day 3 something clicked - the hunger just... stopped. like my body finally got the memo. now i can go all day without eating and not feel like i'm dying.

the jump rope part sucks less now too. still hard but i don't want to die after 2 minutes anymore. calves stopped feeling like they were made of concrete. weird side effect - i have way more energy in the afternoons now. no more 3pm crash where i need to mainline coffee to stay awake.

downsides? yeah. dreamed about food twice. had one day where i almost caved and ate my entire fridge. jump rope gave me a couple of blisters. but 8 pounds is 8 pounds.

gonna keep this up for another 6 weeks and see what happens. maybe try to add some weights. if i disappear it's because i finally caved and married a pizza.

**Hello everybody!**

My no-name Chinese backpack just died on me‚Äîits zippers are all out of whack. It was pretty cheap, so no worries on that part, I guess. I never really cared about having a good backpack, but now I think I have the means to buy myself a quality one.

My budget is around $300, and I'm looking for something that can fit a 16-inch MacBook Pro along with all its accessories (SSD, bulky charger, wires, etc.). I'd also like a compartment for my camera and possibly a lens or two. On top of that, I usually carry a book, a thermos, and a manual coffee grinder (don‚Äôt ask me why, haha).

I want it to actually look good‚ÄîI really like the style of the Peak Design Everyday Backpack and the PM X Nomatic Backpack for reference. I'm not looking for anything too extra; for example, the skulls Nomatic seems to use everywhere are a bit of a turn-off for me.

That said, the most important factor for me is durability. I was considering Peak Design since it checks most of my boxes, but after reading a ton of posts about broken zippers and similar issues, I‚Äôm having second thoughts. I get that no backpack lasts forever, but durability still means a lot to me.

I also live quite far from the EU or US and will need to use a forwarding service to get the backpack delivered. Because of this, a lifetime warranty likely won‚Äôt apply‚Äîit would probably cost me more to ship it back for a replacement than to just buy a new one (the forwarding service only works one way).

I have noticed recently that when she touches me, or grabs my arm for my attention it‚Äôs for a lot longer than what i suppose is normal. (I am british, she is European). So if there is a cultural difference there, it‚Äôs feasible. 

Today, she put her arm right around me, and she pulled me right into her boobs and her side. I felt them, soft but assertively press right up against me as she asked me to do a couple things.

I would also like to add, i am in no way complaining here üòÇ

Further into the day once she came back to the shop, she tapped me on the bum a couple times as she passed me and said thank you, for making her a couple coffees for a her and a friend. 

Bearing in mind, this is all in front of either her son or in the first instance technically her husband was there but i don‚Äôt think he saw. 

FYI - She got a great body, very womanly. I‚Äôm very much into older women, so I‚Äôm just trying to figure this out!? 

A couple times prior to this, she has tapped me on the side of the leg, or stroked my arm/bicep in a positive, friendly way.  Or so it would seem?

I haven't dated since high school. I do community theater and make friends with people really easily. People tend to tell me that they ""don't know how I'm still single"" or other such nonsense. 

A big part of my problem is that I always end up feeling guilty developing a crush on someone I've gotten along with platonically. I grew up in a family of all women, hearing how much women hate it when they're put in ""the girlfriend zone"" by men they just wanted to be friends with. It makes me feel guilty whenever I develop a crush on someone. I feel like it's burdening them. Like, ""she's just here because she's passionate about theater, not to get hit on."" If I end up developing a crush on someone, my first instinct is almost always to try and grow some distance until it goes away because I don't want them to think I was only ever speaking to them because I wanted to sleep with them. 

I've been working on myself, physically, mentally, and career wise, mostly because I feel like it'd just be upsetting for women to deal with ""another ugly/boring guy hitting on them in their hobby space or at work."" I don't know how to start to move past this. I've asked women out before and I handle rejection well. Nobody so far has cut me off or had a drastic reaction to me asking them for coffee or something.

And that is saying something because I am a biiiiig breakfast girl. Love breakfast the most out of any meal. But during this weight loss journey I am super grateful for this combo that helps curb my appetite for a bit! 

Anyone know why this is so effective??

1jjo7se,https://i.redd.it/6ml1g4rm9vqe1.jpeg,If it wasn't expensive and I had a reliable way back home I'd call an ambulance,"Context: i get really bad ovarian cysts and I've been in pain for about a week or so. I was supposed to see a doctor on Friday but had to reschedule because of mom's shoulder hurting (sucks but understandable). I had an appointment for today and she says she can't take me because of all the pollen affecting her allergies, as if we don't have medicine for that IN THE HOUSE, and she's making fun of my hair and calling it a nest because it's gotten knotted and since my hair is really curly and thick and fluffy she compares it to a bird nest (she called it a rat best once on a different occasion).

She KNOWS im in pain but says, like almost back to back ""I can't take you because of allergies, can you make me a cup of coffee pwease? Also do something about your hair.""

I hate having to rely on her because I can't drive. We don't live in an urban area either so there's no public transport nearby. I don't want to pay for an ambulance but I can't get Uber to the doctor it's too much money according to her and if I did get to the ER I have no way to get home.",14,1742921893.0,CPTSDmemes,0,1.0,False
1jjo7hs,https://www.reddit.com/r/spooky_stories/comments/1jjo7hs/the_visitor/,The Visitor,"I never used to think twice about hearing familiar voices outside my house. Living in rural Montana meant frequent visits from family and neighbours, especially during the harsh winter months when we'd check on each other. That changed three weeks ago.

It started with my sister's voice calling from the back porch around midnight. I was doing the dishes when I heard her: ""Hey, can you let me in? My car broke down."" Something felt off. The tone was perfect - that slight Southern drawl she picked up in college - but the cadence was wrong, like someone reading from a script they'd memorized.

I stood frozen at the sink, dishes forgotten. My sister lives in Seattle now. She hasn't visited in over a year.

The voice came again, more insistent this ""Hey, come on, it's freezing out here!"" A pause. ""Please?"" The last word stretched too long, like tape playing at the wrong speed.

I backed away from the door, my wet hands dripping on the linoleum. The security light hadn't triggered - there shouldn't have been anyone on the porch. But I could hear soft footsteps, moving back and forth.

My phone was on the coffee table. I inched toward it, trying to keep my breathing steady. The voice shifted then - not just in tone but in location, coming from the side of the house now. This time it was my mother's voice, perfect down to the way she says my name when she's worried.

""Sweetie? Are you home? The lights are on...""

My mom passed away last spring.

Something scraped against the vinyl siding - not fingernails, but something harder, like bone or horn. The security light finally flickered on, casting long shadows through the kitchen windows. I didn't look. I couldn't look. I just grabbed my phone and retreated to the basement, locking every door between me and that thing.

I called the police, but by the time they arrived, it was gone. They found tracks in the snow though - not human footprints, but deep gouges in sets of three, like massive claws. They led into the woods and disappeared.

The official report says it was probably teenagers playing a prank with recorded voices. But I know what I heard. And I'm not the only one. Three farms over, the Henderson's' youngest boy went missing last week after answering a call from what he thought was his best friend, begging to be let in after dark.

They still haven't found him. But sometimes, late at night, his voice drifts through the valley, calling out to other houses, asking to be let in.

I keep my doors locked now. I don't answer calls after sunset. And when I hear familiar voices outside my house at night, I turn up the TV and pretend I can't hear them begging to come inside.

Because whatever's out there, it's learning. Each time its impressions get better. And I'm terrified that one night, it's going to sound so perfect, so real, that someone's going to open their door without thinking.

And then there'll be one more voice added to its collection.",1,1742921871.0,spooky_stories,0,1.0,False
1jjo79h,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenXWomen/comments/1jjo79h/where_do_people_live_least_stupidly/,Where do people live least stupidly?,"I go to bed with AMA news about the measles outbreak caused by stupid parents, I wake up to news about some drunk asshole texting the stupidest of war plans to the editor of the Atlantic (somehow Stephen Miller's the genius in the room), and as I'm making my coffee I watch the neighbor's lawn guy, who has a blond head covered in sprayed-on red dots (measles solidarity?), drag a hose from a tank of poisons to spray all over the lawn for about five minutes. Gloves, no mask, despite the fact that this stuff aerosolizes. I'm not surprised this happens given that the same people are happy to throw many tons of CO2 into the sky recreationally each year with their giant RV, but I will have to think about how to protect my veg garden, as they're upwind from me.

I'm well aware that there is no Planet B, but do you live in a place with smart people who...you know, mostly do smart things? Take good care of themselves and the world around them? I'm not hugely hopeful since I'm already in a relatively well-educated blue area where you'll still see civic-minded people wearing masks in supermarkets and turning out to pull invasive weeds from parks, supporting the public library and free medical services, will leash their dogs when scolded, etc., though tbh even here the ranks of the middle-class polite-and-educated have been thinning pretty fast here over the last decade, and we've got more ""laws, what are those"" progressives who don't take care of themselves [insert long essay on why they can't and why you're scum for saying so], Christian nationalists, and your garden-variety shrugging ""nobody exists but me"" types. 

I am tired.

If people around you bother treating themselves, their community, and the world around them well, though, make use of that science stuff, try to take care of civic argument through normal civic processes, etc., I'd love to know about your town.",42,1742921855.0,GenXWomen,9,0.96,False

Add a Bianco doppio pod into your Nespresso and brew into the metal shaker with your syrups

Once complete, add lots of ice to the shaker, close and shake for about 15-30 seconds

I work from home in a sales and marketing role and know that when I'm working at my best I'm very good at my job with lots of experience. I used to work in an office and achieved a lot within my role however really suffered with depression and anxiety from masking all day and being bullied by a colleague. 

I'm much happier working from home but find it so difficult to compel myself to get my work done because of executive dysfunction and my energy levels. At my best I'm sociable, I can write good copy, I have ideas people like, I'm self assured and I'm able to get my job done well. In roles where I have to cold call I can be quick thinking for objection handling and can build a rapport with someone which ends with them wanting to buy what I'm selling. This, however is rare.

The issue is I spend so much of my working day doing things to maintain stable energy levels and focus (coffee, making food, cold shower, exercise routine, cleaning my desk). If I drink too much coffee I'm hyper and my minds everywhere, constantly distracted. If my energy levels are too low I'm groggy, awkward, find it hard to concentrate, make easy mistakes and can barely string together a sentence. It leaves me feeling like a fraud. 

Rarely do I have a day where my brain is working well, executive dysfunction means I don't get my work started until the adreniline kicks in about getting in trouble and suddenly my brain magically works and I'm up at 1am writing what I should've written at 2pm. 

All of the above makes me feel so guilty because sometimes I get away without working and am anxious about getting caught out and now I'm working for a smaller company I feel guilty about not working hard enough for them.

I'd appreciate any tips, I'm currently unmedicated but on a waiting list to have an appointment about medication.

We‚Äôre seeing the impact of how we spend our money. It‚Äôs good to know if your favorite coffee shop thinks your rights and those of others don‚Äôt matter. Might be good if others know too!

It would be pretty wild if a bunch of businessnes got Google reviews that pointed out a customer found them via this website and wanted to patronize their store because they advertised on a platform that respects ‚Äútraditional American values‚Äù and *‚Äúwill always protect the family unit and celebrate the sanctity of every life‚Äù*. PublicSquare also aims to *‚Äúrestore the culture through the power of commerce‚Äù* because they just want to *‚Äùensure America remains a great place. Whether a big box retailer‚Äôs agenda crossed the line, or you‚Äôre trying to support more small businesses, we‚Äôre ready to help find your new favorites from people just like you.‚Äù*. Neat.

I bet if someone were to add a Goggle review they might open the website on a secure private browser to search what‚Äôs in their area, use a VPN or other safety measures*, use an alt account and post an innocent but informative review, or scathing, whatever suits you. Some may think the kindness approach is effective because it provides an impression that they can safely show their true colors out in the open. Give them the space to ‚Äúbe themselves‚Äù so everyone can see the rot hidden inside.

It would probably be a good idea to take screenshots of the listing because some places might delete or dispute them later. Might be good to remove any metadata before posting pictures publicly. 

Could it be possible a business doesn‚Äôt realize where they‚Äôve advertised? I doubt it. PublicSquare says they vet their listings and it‚Äôs pretty obvious what they stand for from seeing the home page and their about info. If they did somehow, well, one might think they want to know about it. They have this on their ‚ÄúWho We Are‚Äù page: 

*‚ÄùSupport Families. Change Culture. At PublicSquare, our values are the foundation for everything we do - and we stand for the same values that made this Nation exceptional. You can shop with confidence knowing that all the businesses on our marketplace respect these very same values.‚Äù*

PublicSquare also said this at the bottom of their intro page, *‚ÄùRock some merch to get the word out, or share PublicSquare with your family and friends. We can‚Äôt do this without you, and we‚Äôre just getting started.‚Äù*. Perhaps we should ‚Äúget started‚Äù here too.

I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and say hello to the community.

I‚Äôve been training Krav Maga for over 10 years under Danny Zelig, primarily at Tactica Krav Maga Institute in San Francisco and Berkeley. I recently earned my **Expert-level certification** from Danny, and earlier this year (Feb 2025), I officially took over the San Francisco location and rebranded it as **Forge Krav Maga**.

My goal is to preserve what made Tactica special (so much!) while continuing to evolve the training to meet the needs of contemporary, urban self-defense students. We train 7 days a week, with a focus on striking, clinch, ground, and weapons defense‚Äîeverything pressure-tested, beginner-accessible, and grounded in real-world scenarios.

In addition to Krav, I‚Äôm a **purple belt in BJJ under Victor Oliveira at Alliance San Francisco**, and I love integrating  grappling fundamentals‚Äîimproving position, using leverage, controls and escapes, ‚Äîinto our self-defense curriculum. I also train in **Pekiti Tirsia Kali** (in Jared Wihongi's PTTA organization), which I like to think adds depth to our approach to weapons, movement, and coordination.

If you're ever in San Francisco and want to train (we'd love to have you at Forge) or just grab a coffee ‚Äîhit me up. I‚Äôm always happy to contribute to the Krav and self-defense community and talk shop with other practitioners of the many martial arts.

I've heard enough insights on the cons of this area, including it being a small town and not offering much to do apart from the campus, but I'm looking to find some positives also. 

**So I'd like some updated insight on what Penn State is like these days and what can I be excited about. I have the following questions:**

1. Does the campus offer things to look forward to, apart from sports? I'd enjoy going to a game or two, but I can't see this being my only activity. What are some other things to look forward to?  
2. What are the academics like, particularly for graduate degrees in the School of International Affairs? Do you think it's worth going to penn state?  
3. Is there a big Pakistani and/or Muslim community that I could connect with?  
4. What are some of your favorite things to do/activities to enjoy on-campus and off-campus in the area?  
5. What is the general area in State College like? What are some good things to do nearby?  
6. What is the current housing situation for grad students? So far I've been able to figure out that Patterson Hall and White Course is available to graduate students on campus.  
7. How much would you budget for a comfortable month in the area - average groceries for one person, going out a few times a month, and only splurging on iced coffees lol  
8. Lastly, as someone who's super nervous about moving abroad and living on my own for the first time, how do you suggest I make the most of my two years at Penn State? Any and all suggestions are welcome!

But before that let me share our back story.
I'm a licensed professional, yung sahod ko at sahod ni LIP ay sapat lang. When I was working, habang sya di pa nag i start sa work nya, ako lahat gumastos mapa office top and pants nya for the whole week, ako gunagastos ng foods namin.

But after 1year, pinagresign nya ako kahit ayoko just to put up a small business. Gusto ko sana makaipon ako ng malaki bago ako magresign para sa business na pinapangarap ko. So lahat ng savings ko napunta sa business. Wala natira sakin. After a year lang din pinili nyang mag VA. Since wala kami makuhang tatao sa shop, napilitan akong iclose ang shop just to focus on him kasi kelangan during his training dapat nakaalalay ako. Like syempre need ko sya ipagluto at  dalhan ng foods nya sa office. Need ko sya ipagtimpla ng coffee. So laging 3am na ako nakakatulog and then I need to wake up at 5:40am kasi need ko magprep naman para sa anak namin. Then cook lunch and dinner.

After ng training nya, magrereopen na sana ako sa shop but wala na. Sabi nya saka ko nalang iopen uli yon, mag apply nalang din daw ako as VA. My problem is, mahirap sya para sakin since weakness ko ang makipag communicate.

I tried to apply, but legwak. Again apply uli, but legwak padin.
Ngayon pinag aapply nya ako uli, sabi ko okay, manoniod nood lang ako ng tips para pag sumabak uli hindi na ako malegwak. Kasi pride ko din naman yon, ayoko sa lahat yung nag fe fail ako. Kaya masakit din para sakin.

Now nagagalit sya, nag away kami kesyo ano na daw. Hindi pa daw ba ako mag aapply. Ilang months na daw nakalipas. May pagkabipolar din tong LIP ko sa totoo lang. Ang ganda ng mood namin kanina, binati pa nya ako kasi paglabas nya ng office nakita na ako sa dining sabi pa nya ""andyan ka pa pala"" sabi ko kumakain ako.
Pagpasok nya ng office aba biglang nagrarant na about sa application ko. Like para sakin naman daw yon. Kahit wag ko na daw sila isipin kasi kaya naman daw niya buhayin sarili nya at anak namin. Ako daw need ko yon kasi need ako ng pamilya ko pag nagretire na ang tatay ko lalo na pabigat sa buhay din yung kuya ko 

Alam ko naman, nanonood nood n ako ng tips. Tapos sinbihan ako na di naman daw nya ako nakikita. Paano nya makikita kung tulog sya maghapon? Pag gising naman sya syempre may ginagawa dinn naman akong chores, need ko pa reviewhin yung anak namin. Ihatid sya sa tutor thrice a week. Madaling araw na rin naman ako nakakatulog kasi minsan ako gumagawa ng work nya since tinuruan nga nya ako. So ending makakatulog ako after lunch kasi kinagabihan same routine uli.

Now napepressure ako, lagi nya sinasabi na wala akong ambag. Sabi ko itatry ko uli ang va pag wala padin babalik ako sa profession ko. Ayaw naman nya kasi mababa daw sahod (mataas kasi sahod nya) sabi ko atleast may maipapasok akong pera. Kahit yung sahod nya ay para sa kanya nal√†ng at yung sahod ko ay para sa foods nalang. Kasi sa totoo lang di madali maging va para sa katulad kong hindi naman masalitang tao. So ayon, lagi ko nga sinasabi sa kanya, bakit si ganito same kami profession pero nakalabas ng sasakyan, nakapagbakasyon. Ang point ko lang naman is alam ko naman na gusto nya malaki namam yung sahurn ko, maging futuristic daw ako kaso natetengga na nga ako. Gusto ko din naman may maipasok na pera at makaipon din, at baka nga matuloy pa ang pinapangarap kong magtrabaho abroad pag eto padin ang profession ko, kaso ending sabi pwede naman daw ako mag abroad kahit walang skills, its a matter of diskarte daw. Kaya d ko daw need magwork now ng profession ko. How am I going to work abroad kung di na ako marunong sa mga machines and do manual tests.


Eto na nga nasabihan na ako na mayabng daw ako since sabi ko nga mag aapply nalang ako don sa nakita ko kanina which is perfect sa profession ko. Like what!? Ako mayabang? Kasi lagi nya iniisip na di ko kaya maghanap ng work ng walng tumutulong sakin. yung sa previous work ko kakilala nya kasi yon So sinasabi nya sya nagpasok sakin.

Sa sobrang pag aaway namin kanina, nagsasagutan na kami. Nagbato na sya ng mga babasagin tapos pinalinis din sakin. Sabi ko bakit ko lilinisan yan, sino ba nagkalat. 12am na paglilinisin ako sa kalat na ginawa nya. Alam nyo ginawa nya? Hinila nya ako hanggang sa mapunit yung damit ko. Para ipalinis yung kinalat nya. At sana daw mamatay nalang ako.
At sana nga.... Kasi I'm so tired na.. Nasabihan akong gaslighter kahit sya naman yon. 

Reason daw ng galit nya? Bigla daw ako nagdabog kahit kinakausap lang nya ako ng maayos. What!??? Kaya nga ako nagdabog kasi nabadtrip ako dahil nagulat nalang ako nagrarant at nagagalit na sya. Na mag apply na daw sana ako, kasi ang sarap daw ng buhay ko nasanay daw ako. Matanda na daw ako wala padin daw akong career. Sabi ko nga sa kanya kanina pa na oo mag aapply ako, need ko lang ienhance skills ko. Kaso ayon ako pa nasabihan na bastos kasi nagdabog ako hahahaha. Grabe hahahaha ang funny ng life ko.

1jjnzw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/1jjnzw4/am_i_overreacting/,Am I overreacting?,"Whenever my parents come to visit, they randomly leave and explore whatever town we live in. Husband at work. Me with the kids. My kids still nap and nap time is important to me because my oldest will NOT nap anywhere and if he gets overtired, I‚Äôm having a bad time because he‚Äôs screaming and throwing tantrums. He‚Äôs almost 3. I feel like I don‚Äôt really get the support I need from them. They just are in and out whenever they feel like it and when they leave, they say they‚Äôre going to one place and then they‚Äôll be gone for 3 hours. Like‚Ä¶I feel like I‚Äôm just their hotel and they‚Äôre not really here to help or support me with my almost 3yo and almost 2yo‚Ä¶ They come, clutter up my house, create lots of trash and make suggestions of what I should buy or do to my house, watch the tv/on their phones all day, and leave all times of day. They don‚Äôt help clean unless specifically asked. They don‚Äôt help with the kids unless specifically asked. I cook for everyone including them but then they end up buying takeout anyway half the time, which I‚Äôm not trying to spend money on takeout 2-3 times a day for a week whenever they visit.

Anyway, that‚Äôs the background. Before they came here, I asked my mom if they could put the kids to bed one night so my husband and I could go on a much needed date, seeing as we‚Äôve gone on maybe 3 dates since our oldest was born. They said okay and that‚Äôs great because I hate going out after the kids are in bed bc then we don‚Äôt have time to do much. Well my husband has one day off the week that they‚Äôre here and that‚Äôs today. My dad brought his golf clubs and said he was thinking about going golfing. Okay, cool.

Last night, my oldest woke up once and my youngest woke up 3 times. I took care of 3 of the 4 wake ups and barely got sleep. Then my oldest woke up for good at 6:30am, so he‚Äôs been an angry mess all morning. We normally do something fun in the morning so we were gonna go to the park, but with how long everyone took to get ready, nobody was ready till close to 11. Not the biggest deal normally but kind of annoying when everyone takes 45 minutes to get ready. Then as we‚Äôre about to leave, my dad starts showing my husband his phone and talking about times. I‚Äôm thinking my dad is making dinner plans which I was annoyed about because I already have dinner planned out for tonight and cleared it with both of them. But then I ask what they‚Äôre talking about and my husband says, ‚Äúgolf.‚Äù Scheduling it for after the boys will probably be waking up from nap. Meaning I‚Äôm stuck here during their nap time (as always) and then my husband and dad leave for golf as soon as the boys wake up leaving me and my mom to take care of the kids. Which knowing my mom, she‚Äôd probably end up going with my dad and husband and it‚Äôd be me with the kids. I just started crying. I just said, ‚ÄúOkay, if you are going golfing later, that‚Äôs fine, but I‚Äôm going to stay home while you guys take the kids to the park.‚Äù

It was involuntary but it just all hit me at once. My parents sneak off every day to go explore whatever city we‚Äôre living in (we‚Äôve moved every year for the last 8 years) leaving me with the kids. My husband gets to go on work trips and get full nights of rest (on his work trips..he helps when I need him at nights when he‚Äôs home). Meanwhile I‚Äôm just never thought of. I never get told by my parents, ‚ÄúHey you guys go explore. We‚Äôve got the kids.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know you haven‚Äôt had a break in a year, so go get coffee by yourself while they nap.‚Äù They have already made plans to leave me at home and galavant off by themselves every nap time. I didn‚Äôt mean to cry just because they were planning on golfing. It wasn‚Äôt about that. I want them to be able to bond and play golf together. It was just the cherry on top that made all my feelings come to the surface, that I just feel so so unsupported when my parents come here and I feel like I end up doing more work than normal while they‚Äôre here while everyone gets to escape the kids but me.

Sorry for the novel. Hope I make sense. But give it to me straight, did I overreact? I know I need to be more forthcoming about my feelings but it‚Äôs so hard for me to talk about feelings aloud.",7,1742921369.0,Mommit,2,0.82,False

# The Growing Threats to Online Privacy

Data breaches have become a big problem, affecting millions each year. In 2023, over 23 billion records were exposed*d*, according to the Identity Force Report. Hackers target weak connections and track our online activities, threatening our **online privacy**. Public Wi-Fi spots are also vulnerable to snooping.

# How Virtual Private Networks Shield Your Digital Life

A **virtual private network** acts as a digital shield. It encrypts your data, hides your IP address, and sends your traffic through secure servers. NordVPN's encryption makes your information unreadable to others. This protects your emails, passwords, and private messages from hackers.

# [NordVPN‚Äôs](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) Role in the Cybersecurity Landscape

NordVPN is a leader in cybersecurity. It has 5,900+ servers in 60+ countries, offering global protection. It doesn't keep logs, keeping your data private. Its **vpn service** is for everyone, from casual users to professionals needing strong security.

# My Journey to Better Online Security with NordVPN

My journey to better *online privacy* started with a wake-up call. I'd heard about data breaches and felt uneasy using public Wi-Fi. My credit card details were exposed during a purchase, prompting me to take action.

https://preview.redd.it/rn65lh6v6vqe1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=509ce7a99ca68b3a6de1ae017ee5f75a1327a224

I picked[ NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) after looking at top services. Setting it up was easy. Downloading the app took minutes, and connecting was instant. The app's interface made *secure browsing* simple, even for someone like me who's not tech-savvy.

Here‚Äôs what changed:

* No more anxiety on public networks
* Real-time encryption visible in the app
* Access to blocked content without lag

At first, I wondered if NordVPN was worth the cost. But after a month, the benefits were clear. My browsing history stayed private, and my accounts were safe. The ‚ÄúKill Switch‚Äù feature gave me peace of mind during unstable connections.

Now, I see *nordvpn* as essential, not a luxury. It's part of my daily routine, like locking my front door. Small steps like this make a big difference in staying safe online.

# Core Features That Make [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) Stand Out

NordVPN's success comes from its technical innovations. These innovations turn complex security concepts into everyday safeguards. For users like me, these tools are more than just jargon. They're the difference between vulnerable browsing and secure, worry-free internet use.

https://preview.redd.it/igvyuh4w6vqe1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a758f5004b4d345f79e920223ed338d1e50977d

# Military-Grade Encryption Protocols

Every connection I make uses *nordvpn*‚Äôs AES-256 encryption. This protocol scrambles data into unreadable code. When I work remotely, this *data encryption* keeps client files confidential, even on public Wi-Fi.

# No-Logs Policy: Keeping Data Private

NordVPN‚Äôs strict no-logs policy means no records of browsing history, IP addresses, or connection times. Unlike competitors who collect metadata, this commitment to *online privacy* keeps my digital footprint private.

# Kill Switch Technology

One time, my home router glitched mid-video call. The Kill Switch instantly halted data flow, preventing IP leaks. This failsafe is non-negotiable for anyone prioritizing *internet security* during unstable connections.

# CyberSec Suite

Blocking 1.8 million malicious sites and ads automatically, CyberSec cuts phishing risks and speeds up browsing. It‚Äôs like having a firewall between me and online threats without lifting a finger.

|Feature|Description|Real-World Use|
|:-|:-|:-|
|AES-256 Encryption|256-bit encryption standard|Prevents data interception during remote work|
|No-Logs Enforcement|Zero user activity tracking|Ensures anonymity while researching sensitive topics|
|Auto Kill Switch|Connection disruption protection|Stopped data leaks during a coffee shop power outage|
|CyberSec|Malware/ad blocking system|Blocked phishing sites during online shopping|

These features aren't just technical specs‚Äîthey're the reason I rely on NordVPN daily. Every element works together to create a shield against modern digital threats without sacrificing usability.

# Understanding How [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) Maintains Your Online Anonymity

**Online anonymity** is key in today's digital world. NordVPN makes it easy with its *virtual private network* tech. It keeps your identity hidden without the tech talk.

When you use NordVPN, your IP address changes to one from its global servers. This stops websites and advertisers from finding you. I tested it and found that my search history stayed secret from others.

* **IP Masking:** Hides your real location with over 5,400 servers in 59 countries
* **DNS Leak Protection:** Blocks apps from bypassing encryption safeguards
* **Secure Tunneling:** Encrypts data before it leaves your device

|Key Anonymity Features|How It Works|
|:-|:-|
|Server Network|Reroutes traffic through chosen global locations|
|Headquarters|Panama‚Äôs privacy laws prevent data-sharing demands|
|Encryption|256-bit AES standard prevents eavesdropping|

On a recent trip, I tested NordVPN at a public Wi-Fi. Without [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902), my device was found fast by a tracker. But with NordVPN, the tracker found nothing. This shows how well it protects your *online anonymity*.

True *internet security* means knowing what works and what doesn't. NordVPN doesn't hide illegal stuff but keeps your browsing private. I've used servers in different places to avoid being tracked and still got fast speeds.

# Bypassing Geo-Restrictions: Accessing Global Content Anywhere

With *nordvpn*, you can easily get past geo-blocks. It opens up a world of entertainment and information. You can enjoy content from anywhere, all while keeping your online privacy safe.

*Nordvpn* helps users in restricted areas. By connecting to servers in open regions, you can access news, social media, and educational resources. Their servers are in 59 countries, ensuring freedom and security.

>‚ÄúOur 5,900+ servers in 59 countries ensure freedom without compromising security.‚Äù

# Using [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) for Travel and International Business

While traveling, I used *nordvpn* for:

* Accessing US-based cloud platforms from overseas
* Streaming home-country TV shows during downtime
* Securely logging into corporate networks via dedicated IP servers

This *vpn service* connects you to the digital world, no matter where you are. It keeps your online privacy safe.

# Setting Up [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) on Different Devices

Setting up *nordvpn* on various devices was easier than I thought. It worked the same way on my Windows laptop, iPhone, and smart TV. Here's how to do it:

|Device|Steps|Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Windows/Mac|Download app ‚Üí Install ‚Üí Log in ‚Üí Connect|Auto-connect ensures secure browsing on startup.|

|Routers|Install firmware ‚Üí Link account ‚Üí Select servers|Router setup requires a NordVPN account but protects all connected devices.|
|Smart TVs|Use dedicated app or router configuration|I used router setup for my Samsung TV to avoid manual app logins.|

My biggest challenge was setting up my router. The first try failed because of old firmware.

>""Updating to the latest firmware resolved the issue instantly,""

the support chat at [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) told me.

The *virtual private network* lets you connect six devices at once. I connected my laptop, phone, tablet, and smart TV without any issues. For routers, make sure the firmware is compatible before you start. After setting it up, I tested how it affected speeds. You can read about that next.

# Speed and Performance: Does NordVPN Slow Down Your Connection?

Using a *vpn service* often raises speed concerns. I tested **nordvpn** to see if it balances *internet security* with speed. NordVPN's innovations aim to minimize the impact of encryption on speed.

# NordLynx Protocol: The Speed Revolution

NordLynx, built on WireGuard, focuses on speed without losing privacy. It reduces latency and increases data flow. Here's why it's special:

* Reduced handshake time for faster connections
* Optimized encryption for smoother streaming
* Support for modern devices and operating systems

# Server Selection Strategies for Optimal Performance

Choosing the right server is key. Here are tips to boost speed:

* Choose servers geographically closer to your location
* Use the NordVPN app‚Äôs ‚ÄúQuick Connect‚Äù feature
* Avoid peak hours for high-traffic activities like gaming

# My Real-World Speed Test Results

My tests showed baseline speeds of 250 Mbps. With NordVPN, speeds dropped to 220 Mbps. This is a small loss for encrypted browsing. Gaming ping times were under 50ms on optimized servers.

# [NordVPN ](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902)Pricing Plans and Value Proposition

NordVPN has pricing plans for everyone. As someone who cares about *online privacy*, I found their options clear and flexible. They offer monthly, yearly, and multi-year plans, with discounts for longer terms. The yearly plan, for example, saves 64% compared to monthly payments, making it a great long-term choice.

1. **Monthly Plan:** $11.95/month (best for short-term testing)
2. **Yearly Plan:** $2.99/month (best value at checkout)
3. **2-Year Plan:** $1.99/month (longest commitment with maximum savings)

NordVPN is special because its features match its price. A single payment lets you use it on up to six devices, which is common but still useful. They also accept crypto payments, adding more privacy for those worried about financial tracking.

* **No-logs policy:** No data retained, ever.
* **Server network:** 5,800+ servers in 60+ countries.
* **24/7 support:** Live chat and email assistance included.

The cost is worth it when you think about the protection you get. While some might find cheaper options, NordVPN's speed, encryption, and support are hard to beat. Plus, their frequent discounts help keep the price down without sacrificing *online privacy*.

After using NordVPN for months, I think it's a good deal. For those who want the best security, it's a solid investment. It's better than the risks of using a less secure.

# Advanced Security Features for Power Users

NordVPN offers top-notch tools for those who need extra privacy controls. These features let you tailor your protection without losing speed or ease of use. Let's see how they work in real life.

>‚ÄúAdvanced settings like Onion Over VPN redefine what‚Äôs possible in digital privacy.‚Äù ‚Äî NordVPN Security Team

# Double VPN for Extra Protection Layers

Double VPN encrypts your data twice by sending it through two servers. It acts as a strong shield against government or corporate tracking. I've used it to access sensitive files, knowing they were encrypted twice before reaching their destination.

# Dedicated IP Options

A dedicated IP gives you a unique address instead of a shared one. It's great for logging into restricted sites like banks. My tests showed it's perfect for professionals who need reliability without giving up too much privacy.

# Onion Over VPN Capabilities

This feature combines NordVPN with Tor's network. It routes your traffic through both, making it hard to trace. I've used it in places with strict censorship, keeping my online identity hidden while getting past blocks.

These features are more than just tech talk. They're real tools for protecting your online presence. Whether you're working remotely or fighting for privacy, they make your **internet security** a reality.

# [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=120401&url_id=902) vs. Leading Competitors: An Honest Comparison

Choosing the best *vpn service* means looking at key features. I tested NordVPN against ExpressVPN, Surfshark, and CyberGhost. Here's what I found:

|Feature|NordVPN|ExpressVPN|Surfshark|CyberGhost|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Server Network|5,900+ servers in 59 countries|3,000+ servers in 90+ countries|1,700+ servers in 65 countries|10,000+ servers (many shared)|
|Speed Performance|Top-tier with NordLynx protocol|Fast, but fewer server locations|Average speeds|Slower in peak hours|
|Security|Double VPN, CyberSec, and strict no-logs policy|No double VPN; strong encryption|No-logs policy but limited advanced features|Basic encryption tools|
|Price|$3.49/month (2-year plan)|$12.95/month|$2.49/month|$11.99/month|

NordVPN stands out for its balance of speed and security. While Surfshark is cheaper, NordVPN offers better encryption and dedicated IP options. In tests, NordVPN's CyberSec filter blocked 98% of ads and trackers, beating Surfshark's 85%.

NordVPN is based in Panama, which offers more privacy than US-based providers. This makes it a top choice for those who value privacy.

* Best for advanced users: NordVPN
* Most budget-friendly: Surfshark
* Global reach: ExpressVPN

My choice depends on what you need. For strong privacy and global servers, NordVPN is the best. Surfshark is great for those on a budget, but NordVPN's encryption is unmatched for secure browsing.

# Common Misconceptions About VPN Services

Many think a *vpn service* means total *online anonymity*. But, it's just one part of keeping your online life private. I found out that no single tool can remove all digital footprints.

>‚ÄúAnonymity requires more than just switching on a device,‚Äù warns NordVPN‚Äôs security team. This aligns with my experience‚Äîtechnology alone can‚Äôt fix careless browsing habits.

There's a big myth: free *vpn service* options are as good as paid ones. But, many free services sell your data to advertisers. Paid services like NordVPN focus more on *internet security* than making money from tracking you.

* **Myth:** All *vpn service* providers protect equally. Third-party audits confirm NordVPN‚Äôs no-logs policy, unlike most competitors.
* **Myth:** A *vpn service* hides your real IP address completely. It masks your ISP‚Äôs IP but doesn‚Äôt hide metadata like search history.
* **Myth:** Using a *vpn service* is illegal everywhere. Legal status varies‚ÄîNordVPN operates in 59 countries with strict compliance policies.

Speed is another worry. But, NordVPN‚Äôs NordLynx protocol cuts latency by 30% compared to older methods. This shows you can have both *online privacy* and fast speeds.

My journey showed that *online anonymity* is about making smart choices. NordVPN‚Äôs tools work best when you keep your software up to date and are careful online.

As a long-term NordVPN user, I've found it crucial for keeping my online activities private. Its military-grade encryption and no-logs policy protect me from tracking and cyber threats.

What‚Äôs worse is that he never says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù only ‚ÄúLove you‚Äù and ‚ÄúMe, too‚Äù in response to I love you. That‚Äôs crazy because it‚Äôs like yes someone in the world loves you but it‚Äôs not me, and yes I love myself as well.¬†English is his second language but he is really good at it so I must assume he knows what he is doing. I told him that I want him to be himself. I was so mad when I walked in the house that I threw away those post it notes in the bin. Maybe I‚Äôm being ungrateful, but it‚Äôs not enough. The next day, I get a fucking cartoon. That‚Äôs a big leap from a Post it.¬† I don‚Äôt even think he is loyal, which baffles me. Pick one, you‚Äôre either ugly or rude. He is so smart, but not pretty. So I decided to test him by getting my friend to flirt with him, and he passed but was a bit dodge in that he agreed to keep it a secret from me. I think he passed because he suspected it was a test though. In any case, let‚Äôs see if he brings it up. It will tell me if he is playing for power or not. He is introducing me to his parents tomorrow, but I don‚Äôt believe he is serious about me. The reason I‚Äôm saying this is because my father and my boyfriend are almost exactly the same. They are both doctors, they both have the same hair (yes he shaved his head), glasses, personality. They even make their coffee the same way. Eat the same too. Very disciplined, but very cold to their wife. I don‚Äôt want that. That‚Äôs the last thing I want, to have a relationship like my mother and father.¬†But in many ways, he is not like my father. My father buys me perfumes, handbags, jewellery and takes me out to good dinners. He also ignores and used to physically abuse my mother. He would let me do anything I wanted, and gave all his love and attention to me. My mother got neglected. I can‚Äôt and I will never be in a relationship with someone like that. My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt buy me anything, though he used to buy us dinners in the first few weeks. He also cried for the first time in 4 years since his ex broke up with him, when I tried to break up with him. My father would never cry. I have never seen him in a weak position. There is an element of projection here and it is messing with my understanding of the situation. I‚Äôm not sure what to tell him or what I can do to get my way. I might try to get some guy to buy me something or give me something for free in front of him at the mall. Should be easy enoughh.",0,1742921354.0,relationship_advice,4,0.27,False

Listening to ATP last year, Marco described an app that apparently does not exist. The way it was described was:

>‚ÄúSo, all I want to do is I want an app that every morning, I can tag the sleep I had the night before with arbitrary tags that I input.

>Things like, you know, whether I like stayed up too late or maybe I had a late meal or maybe I was like, you know, sleeping alone because I was, you know, at the beach by myself or something. Like, you know, like I want to have like tags that I can tag my sleep, you know, late coffee, alcohol consumption, things like that. And then I want to be able to see in the future, like I want to be able to pick a tag and see like, okay, with this tag, your sleeps with this one are, you know, 12% better on average than sleeps that don't have this tag or 12% worse.

>Is there an app that Merlin always talks about and makes fun of?

>Yeah, yeah.

>It's like, you know, when you are in Washington, you sleep worse. Like, you weigh more but sleep worse.‚Äù

>‚ÄúSo I have been looking for apps to do this. And I have, so thanks to, you know, some ChatGPT research, I installed the top couple of sleep apps. They have been like super disasters of just gross, like massive privacy invasion, huge suites of functionality, doing all sorts of stuff I don't need.‚Äù

>...

>‚ÄúAnd it's like, oh my god, just let me just tag my sleep and see data. That's it. That's all I want.

>So far, I have not found anything to do it.‚Äù

This piqued my interest - I also found this an interesting proposition. Knowing just enough Swift to be dangerous, I've worked on a simple interpretation of this over the past couple of months. It lets you import sleep data from HealthKit, tag it with arbitrary tags, and analyse it with a series of charts.

I'd love to get feedback on it - there's a public TestFlight link here: [https://testflight.apple.com/join/D9HekpXP](https://testflight.apple.com/join/D9HekpXP)

(There is a subscription IAP, mainly because I wanted to use this as an opportunity to learn how to implement this. If you buy it using the TestFlight build, you will **not** be charged - it will show a payment UI used for testing purposes.)

The to-do list still has a few things on it, including cleaning up the onboarding flow, improving accessibility and Dynamic Type compatibility, and fixing some bugs with the chart description generation. If people also think this is interesting to see, the future roadmap includes things like widgets, Apple Watch companion, etc.

Open to any & all feedback, but thought it would be good to share with this community!

3 days ago my wife and I saw a stray cat near the coffee shop we visit. We love cats so we went up to it. The cat was super friendly and rubbing on my wife and rolling around.

It seemed like a mostly playful bite like our pet cat does, but I noticed my pants had a wet spot from the cats saliva.

We have traveled to Europe multiple times and usually plan 3 weeks if possible so this was definitely a short trip for us, but worth it! Here's a quick rundown of what we did and what we thought. 

**Day 1** \- arrived in Dublin late morning.   
\* Had pre-booked Citylink Bus tickets for Galway. Our tickets were not until later but they let us jump on when we arrived. Couple hours to Galway.  
\* Stayed at the Hyde Hotel. It's minutes walk from both bus stop and train station which was very convenient. The hotel was nice. The theming in the bar & restaurant was really fun. We had breakfast there one morning and it was delicious.   
\* Spent the afternoon/evening exploring Galway - found a self-guided walking tour which took us to major sites in the city - Eyre Square and it's few landmarks/statues, Lynch's Castle, High Street & Shop Street, Latin Quarter including Thomas Dillon's Claddagh Ring Museum, Spanish Arch, Galway City Museum, Nimmo's Pier where you can see the pretty multi-colored houses (The Long Walk), River Walk, Galway Cathedral.   
\* Grabbed some dinner in a local pub and called it a night

**Day 2** \- booked a tour with Galway Tour Company that was FANTASTIC. Meeting spot was just 5 minutes from our hotel and our guide was amazing.   
\* We were up extra early, so we decided to walk the city and grab some pastries/coffee. It was fun watching the city come alive and the sunrise over the river was absolutely STUNNING  
\* Met our tour and drove out to Doolin through the Burren and some great little villages. Got lots of history along the way. Stopped for a quick photo opp at the top of Corkscrew Hill. Loved seeing the rolling hills, stone walls and lots of sheep.  
\* Boarded the ferry at Doolin for Inisheer of the Aran Islands. The waters were rough, but it was only about 20 minutes ride.   
\* We had pre-booked eBikes from Joyce's Bike Hire (down by the beach) on the island, but our guide gave people lots of options to see the island - walking, bikes, eBikes, horse & trap or minibus. The eBikes were one of the more expensive options but 100% worth it. We saw everything on the island we wanted to see - the shipwreck, lighthouse, castle ruins, Napoleonic tower ruins, graveyard with the ""sunken"" church, the mideval church, hotel, beach, etc. It was fantastic. We were glad we had hat and gloves as it was cold & windy. We definitely could have spent longer there as well.   
\* One of the reasons we booked this tour was that on nice days they take a boat cruise by the Cliffs of Moher. This is 100% dependent on how rough the waters are so we did not get to do it that day (which we knew was a likelihood this time of year), but thought it was a cool possibility. They also take you to the top of the Cliffs of Moher. So we knew we would get to see them either way.   
\* After the ferry we stopped at a pub in Doolin for lunch - great food & drinks, quick service, similar prices to what we had paid in Galway  
\* Cliffs of Moher - we had time to walk as much of the trails that were open, visit O'Briens tower and the visitors center. Also cold & windy and glad we had hat/gloves.   
\* Drive back to Galway - our guide gave us some great tips on where to go that night to listen to some Trad music.   
\* Arrived back in Galway and went to The Westend to The Crane for Trad music. Glad we didn't get there any later as it was quickly packed. But very cool. Especially loved that it was young people playing the music. Enjoyed our time there until we realized we were starving. Not a lot of places still had kitchens open, but we found a great Thai place that was delicious!   
  
**Overall of Galway** \- great city that we really enjoyed. Wished we would have had more time for: Salthill & Galway City Museum. Also would have loved another day to head to Connemara. 

**Day 3** \- decided to head to Dublin via train instead of bus. Booked online and walked to the station minutes from our hotel. Couple hours ride to Dublin.  
\* Arrived in Dublin and could have taken a bus to our hotel, but decided to walk along the river to just enjoy the sites and it was a gorgeous sunny day  
\* Stayed at the Marlin Hotel. Location was decent. We booked one of their Cozy King Rooms and it is SMALL, which I knew, but the reality was that we should have booked something a little bigger just to spread out a bit. But it was clean and the amenities were nice. The lobby has a very cool aesthetic with lots of social/seating areas, a restaurant, coffee stand, etc. They also have a gym and complimentary laundry machines to use. It is only a few minutes walk from restaurants, pubs and even a Lidl grocery store.   
\* Once we dropped our bags at the hotel we grabbed a taxi down by the river and headed to Kilmainham Gaol (reservations open 28 days in advance and often sell out), we were glad we were able to snag some spots. It was an interesting and informative tour of a place that holds a lot of sad history. Bring a jacket as it's often cold both inside and outside of the tour. After the tour you have some time to look around the museum a bit.   
\* We jumped on a bus and headed back to our hotel. Bus system is easy to use. We needed coins to buy a ticket on the bus.   
\* Enjoyed dinner at a pub near our hotel - more wonderful food (we found that pub food as a whole is rarely bad)  
\* Stopped in at Lidl to grab some snacks for our tour the next day

**Day 4** \- we decided instead of getting ourselves to Belfast and back we would just do a day tour to Northern Ireland and were glad we did. Booked a tour with Wild Rover Tours going to Belfast, Dunluce Castle & Giants Causeway.   
\* Met early, but was only about 15 minutes walk from our hotel. The Starbucks we met at was open early and many people grabbed a coffee or pastry before the tour.   
\* Great tour guide giving us some history as we drove through the city and towards Belfast  
\* Arrived at a little shopping center in Belfast where we could use the bathroom and grab a snack if wanted  
\* Everyone had a choice between a Black Cab Tour of Belfast (focusing on ""the Troubles"") or Titanic Museum. Those of us who were doing Black Cab met our drivers there as we were split into groups of 5 for our tours. Our driver was great and took us around to major sites of the conflicts and told his stories of growing up during that time.   
\* Met up with our group at the Titanic Museum where we time to walk around the yard/slip where the Titanic was built, visit the gift shop, use the bathroom and also saw Titanic Studios (creator of Game of Thrones)  
\* Headed out of Belfast to Dunluce Castle - this tour included entrance to the castle which we really liked as many of them just stop at a viewpoint to see it. Explored this ancient castle which is also the inspiration and filming location for Castle Greyjoy in Game of Thrones.  
\* Headed to Giants Causeway. Walked down to the Causeway although there is also a shuttle that is 1 pound if you want to ride (payable with card or cash). Spent some time exploring the Causeway.  
\* Hiked back up and enjoyed lunch at the pub.   
\* Drove back to Dublin with a quick stop for bathrooms/snacks at a filling station

**Overall of Northern Ireland** \- so glad we went, loved that we got a few highlights and could definitely go back and spend more time there! 

**Day 5** \- this was our day to explore Dublin.   
\* Had Trinity College/Book of Kells tickets for first thing in the morning. Perfect way to start our day! Our guide was great and the Book of Kells/Longroom is impressive.   
\* After our tour, we jumped on the Rick Steves Europe app and did the walking tour starting from Trinity College - saw Bank of Ireland (you can still go inside and see the House of Lords), Molly Malone Statue, MJ O'Neill's, The Bank Restaurant & Bar (step inside even if you aren't eating there - it's gorgeous), Dublin Castle, City Hall Dublin, Christ Church Cathedral (I am OBSESSED with the tile floors in here), Fishamble Street where a Viking Village once stood and where Handel's Messiah was first performed, Temple Bar, Wall of Fame and Ha Penny Bridge.   
\* We took a break in the middle of all that to eat lunch at Featherblade  - we did their set lunch menu which was DELICIOUS and the service was top notch. We were glad we went right as they opened for lunch because it was quickly packed and we can see why.   
\* We then ventured up to St Patrick's Cathedral which was also on our list and has a really interesting history.   
\* We were too late for any of the Guinness Tours, but went to the Jameson Tour. Our guide was very good, but the only disappointment is that it is no longer a working distillery so you get a drink before you go, step into a room where they talk about the process and you have a few hands on things to look at, do a tasting of several types of Jameson, but that's it. There is a very cool bar as you enter that people were enjoying drinks and singing which was super fun. But it wasn't really worth the cost in my opinion.   
\* We made our way back to our hotel to the sound of church bells and lots of people out in the pubs. It was a fun walk back. 

**Day 6** \- we left Dublin this day so we went early to Bread 41 which had been recommended to us and grabbed some pastries before we left and then grabbed a taxi to the airport. 

**Overall of Dublin** \- big city, but doesn't feel as big as so many others. We saw a lot but there was so much we still would have loved to see. Next time! 

**Final Thoughts -** Our trip was fast and furious, but we saw a lot in a short time and loved every minute of it. We definitely could have spent more time in Galway, Dublin and Belfast and would love to come back and see more of the countryside. We were just fine without a car. While public transportation is not quite as widespread in Ireland as it is in other parts of Europe, we found we could get around quite easily and were glad we opted for tours to see a few things that would have been difficult to get to without a car. We had fantastic food the whole time we were there. Most of all, Irish people are probably the nicest and friendliest people I've ever met in my life! And we have traveled a lot and met so many wonderful people. But the Irish topped them all so far. We definitely plan to go back if we ever get the chance! ",4,1742921037.0,irishtourism,2,1.0,False

I've had my Slayer Single Group Espresso for \~3 months now. Prior to that I used a Miele Superautomatic (CM6350), Flair 58 with their manual grinder, and long ago a Breville Oracle Touch.

My beans are not impressive but generally are adequate - Lavazza Espresso Barista Gran Crema Whole Bean Coffee Blend, Medium Espresso Roast.

My equipment is a Slayer Espresso Single Group, Puqpress mini, a Eureka Atom W75.

I grind 20g of beans, use a spirograph WDT (ARO Orbit PROARO Orbit PRO), and a Puq Press Mini in the mode with 2 slower tamps at 30 pounds.

I intend to draw 40g of espresso in 30 seconds, and about do that - though I slow the pour a bit by moving back to pre-brew at the end. Prebrew at the beginning is 7 seconds. This yields about 2:1 in 30 seconds.

Slayer settings are about 194F, 65% pump pressure.

Here's my concerns: Espresso tastes yucky - but unclear if I lack the palate. 1:2 Espress:Water with some Truvia and Milk tastes good. Latte/Cappucinos tastes yummy.

It seems like the espresso push isn't as thick/creamy as I've seen. What do you think?

I feel like I have something 'off.' So while I'm getting the yield in the right time, I'm wondering if I should change something to get more crema/taste - like increase fineness and pressure?

Poor video below. Any input appreciated - thank you!

1jjnl10,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMallWorld/comments/1jjnl10/reality_shifting_and_mw/,reality shifting and MW,"i recently had this experience during a MW dream, and i believe that it might be helpful for those experiencing the negative versions of MW: 


‚Äú i had a dream that i was visiting the vintage mansion in MW. i think that my parents either lived there in this dream and had recently moved in, or they were renting it. 

at the start of this dream i kept trying to tell them that something was off about that house, but they wouldn‚Äôt listen to me and saying this upset them. i eventually gave up on trying to convince them to leave and settled in for the night but couldn‚Äôt sleep well. 

at around 5 am in the dream i crept down the staircase to make some coffee. but as i was walking through the kitchen area of the mansion i suddenly stop and get this overwhelming sensation across my entire body, and my head rolls back ( this felt out of my control ) ‚Ä¶. i also began to hear a loud ringing that sounded similar to frequency music. 

i take a look around the mansion now and it looks a little different‚Ä¶ there is now a crawl space where the kitchen used to be, and done of the decor has changed. 

i crouch to peer into the crawl space and see a coffee machine as well as other room doors on the other side. the lights are off on this new side of the mansion, but as i look a few of them flicker. 

i‚Äôm obviously shocked because these rooms weren‚Äôt previously visible in the house and seemed to appear out of nowhere... i then decide  to crawl through to the other side of the wall to check out that coffee machine. once on the other side, i began to hear distant banging coming from inside of a few of the rooms and get freaked out‚Ä¶. so i then turn around and try to crawl back out as quickly as possible. during this crawl i ended up banging my stomach into a corner of the wall.

i finally get back out, but then i start to hear the ringing and music again, and once again my head rolls back. 

now i‚Äôm in another version of the mansion that is empty and cold‚Ä¶. this one felt like it had been empty for years. the banging continues. 

some instinct kicked in and i felt that i had to get up high, so i climb up onto a high shelf in the living room, when these creatures burst in‚Ä¶ they looked like a mix of a shadow creature and a dog almost.  

there was two of them, and they are silent but run back and forth so fast trying to figure out how to get me that i could feel the air on my face. then, one of them reaches out to try to touch my face and that‚Äôs when i jolt back within the dream, then go into sleep paralysis. ‚Äú

after finally waking up and regaining movement in real life, i notice that i have a bruise on my stomach. 

i think that ‚Äòshifting‚Äô within the dream and learning how to control what dimension of MW that you dream about could be helpful to anyone trying to get more positive experiences there.

Someone asked if we had any plans for her 30th, and I told them to keep April free.
My girlfriend corrected me that her birthday is actually in late June.

People sort of laughed it off, but my girlfriend got visibly annoyed. Her brother joked, ‚ÄúAt least you can‚Äôt get her eye color wrong with her sitting right there,‚Äù and that‚Äôs when she turned and said, ‚ÄúOkay, then what color are my eyes?‚Äù I stammered, ‚ÄúBlue?‚Äù They‚Äôre green.

She went dead silent, and everyone else just stared at their plates. I tried to laugh it off‚Äî‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrible with eye colors, sorry!‚Äù‚Äîbut she was not amused and left soon after.

The next day, my phone blew up. Her friends called me ‚Äúinconsiderate‚Äù and ‚Äúclueless,‚Äù my sister told me to ‚Äúgrow up and pay attention,‚Äù and one of my girlfriend‚Äôs coworkers‚Äîwho I‚Äôve met once‚Äîsaid I came off as ‚Äúemotionally unavailable.‚Äù

That evening, she showed up at my place while I was painting new miniatures.

All I could do was stand there, fumbling for answers.

I told her she was overreacting. She said I never care about her feelings, that I treat her like an afterthought, and that it‚Äôs exhausting always being the only one invested in this relationship. She left again.

I decided to show her she was wrong so I started scrolling through our texts to find any details that I could cling to, but I kept hitting dead ends.

1jjngqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jjngqo/aio_with_how_my_friend_treated_me_for_my_birthday/,AIO with how my friend treated me for my birthday?,"Hello, the people of reddit, this is going to be long I need some perspective.
 
My birthday was just over a month ago. My very good friend, Lana (24 F), had asked me a couple of months prior what I wanted to do for my birthday. I have always been someone who takes their birthday seriously. I do a big majority of the planning, organizing, inviting and paying for things. When it comes to my other friends‚Äô birthdays, I try to do the same for them but keep them in the loop since most people do not like surprises. For example, I ask them what they might want to do or give options to pick from or communicate, ‚Äòhey most people can‚Äôt do the original Friday date, would Saturday work for you.‚Äô
 
When she asked me this, I thought about it and told her, ‚Äòhey‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never had someone organize or plan something for me for my birthday before. I really went full out last year for yours and a couple other people‚Äôs b-days so I would really appreciate if you and them could come together and do the planning. If you need help or don‚Äôt want to do it, I completely understand, and I will figure something out, just please let me know and keep me informed.‚Äù
 
She agreed that it would be no issue. Now, I‚Äôve never liked surprises, I‚Äôm very vocal about it and most people know, especially this group of friends. I also never explicated said the words ‚Äúplease surprise me,‚Äù (important detail for later.)  While we were getting closer to the date, I would ask things along the line of ‚Äúwill it be on my birthday? Or do I need to make sure I don‚Äôt have plans on another day.‚Äù Her response: ‚Äòits on your birthday.‚Äù Me: ‚Äúcool, I was debating about taking a half day at work or not. What time and maybe that will help me to decide. Her: ‚Äòjust take half a day.‚Äù
 
A month later, ME:  ‚Äòhey I know you really don‚Äôt want me to get involved at all but did you invite (specific group of people)?‚Äô Her: ‚Äòyes its all been taken care of.‚Äù  Side note: I just felt like all of her responses had a lot more attitude behind them as usual, so I just shut up.
Small detail, I have been having certain issues with this friend in the past, I had brought up multiple times that I wish to be included, invited more often. 3 separate conversations over the course of 2 years and I have no seen a change. One week before my birthday, she has going out plans with a bunch of people we both know and she doesn‚Äôt extend an invitation. Friday night, she sent a text at 2 in the morning, ‚Äòwhat are you doing.‚Äù And then Saturday, by luck, we went the same bar. I had plans to catch up with an old friend and she was with most of her group of friends I‚Äôve known for 8 years. That Saturday night, I was very upset because of the rest of the night she wanted me to ditch the friend I was with to join them. All I could think was, ‚Äòshe was never going to invite me if I hadn‚Äôt run into her.‚Äù Her and I had plans the next day to go thrifting and get coffee and do a catchup.
 
I wanted to bring up the conversation again about how I have been feeling bad that she doesn‚Äôt think about me at all when making plans. I decided against it because my thought process was she is probably doing most of the planning for my birthday so I don‚Äôt want to accuse her of not caring and I don‚Äôt want to make anything awkward. Another detail about this is one of my out of town friends, Melissa (24F), was going to come in for my birthday weekend. 

When Lana and I were hanging out the weekend before, she had invited me to do something Feb 15th, my birthday is Feb 14th. I told her, ‚Äú hey would Melissa be able to come since you know she is spending the entire weekend with me?‚Äù Her response: ‚Äòno she is not invited.‚Äù I just stared at her‚Ä¶.I told her then I wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend. Did she expect me to blow off my friend who is driving 6 hours to spend the weekend with me? That put a bad taste in my mouth. She is finally extending an invitation to me but isn‚Äôt inviting my friend, who she knows, who is staying with me‚Ä¶ 

Before I left the hangout, I had only asked her two questions about the birthday plans. 1) what should I wear? 2) what time do I need to be ready on Friday so I can plan my day accordingly. Her response: 1) whatever. 2) Im not telling you. I left her house wanting to cry. I didn‚Äôt want to look stupid or out of place. What if I wore a nice dress and heels to a rage room or jeans and sneakers to a nice dinner. 

The next day I called Melissa crying. Full blown panic attack. I needed confirmation that Lana had something planned and she was just acting this way. Over the 2-hour cry session via phone call, Melissa just kept saying things like ‚Äòim sure she does. Everything will be fine. ‚Äú This did not reassure me. Over this whole ordeal I just felt like I put our friendship in perspective. I do not like doing that, relationships aren‚Äôt transactional, and I hate how I started comparing what I did for her birthdays and what she has done for mine.
 
For the entire week leading up to my birthday I was an emotional wreck. I felt like garbage. A couple of days before I had some screenshots sent to me from another friend. Lana texted everyone two days before ‚Äúhey she is going to hate this but I want everyone to ignore her for her birthday so she upset all day and she thinks we forgot so then I can surprise that I planned something.‚Äù Multiple people texted back along the lines of ‚Äúthat‚Äôs bad idea. She is not going to like that. She is going to hate you.‚Äù Her response: ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care.‚Äù I think I broke when I read this. Someone I call one of my best friends just said she doesn‚Äôt care if I hate her for this.
 
THE WHOLE PLAN WAS FOR ME TO BE MISERABLE SO WHEN MY FRIEND FROM OUT OF TOWN SHOWS UP SHE TAKES ME OUT TO FEEL BETTER AT A BOWLING ALLEY.
 
Now, I‚Äôve been upset from the lack of communication from Lana and other things that have complied over the years. I was putting a lot on these birthday plans, for the end goal of bowling. I hate bowling‚Ä¶.. like its one of those things that most people know this. I am also turning 23 years old, not 6. I‚Äôm already upset with everything about this and to find out that it‚Äôs bowling just hurt so much. Overall, even though this was for me, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt taken into consideration.
 
Ngl, I‚Äôm a sensitive person, most people in my life know how much of a big deal I make my birthday. So getting ignored hurt so incredibly bad, doing something I actually loathe, hurt, having my friends lie to me, hurts.
 
So, I knew the plan before, and I honestly almost called Melissa and told her not to come. Hell, I was debating if I even wanted to go to the party plans. When I learned that Melissa was a big part of this plan, I was crushed. I had been crying all week, talking to some people I‚Äôm close to saying things like ‚Äòshe wouldn‚Äôt lie to me but especially not about this she knows how upset I am.‚Äù

I had talked to some older adults in my life and they did talk me into going to the bowling plans and having a conversation with Melissa when she arrives. That is what I did. Her and I had a very healthy conversation about this. Lots of tears were shed and she had told me that these plans had made her uncomfortable because she knew I was going to be unhappy but was pushed by Lana that everything would be fine. I had gotten a lot more details at this point. Lana started inviting people extremely late for plans on Valentine‚Äôs Day night. She gave options and most people rejected bowling and she said ‚Äòthat sucks that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning.‚Äù And people telling her the ignoring me thing was not cool.
We go to the party, I was on best behavior. I didn‚Äôt make a scene, didn‚Äôt yell, socialized, thanked Lana, and then Lana completely ignores me during the party. She went to the bathroom for 30 minutes after Melissa and I arrived. Some of the only words she said to me was ‚Äòso who told you?‚Äô Nothing was planned afterwards. It was bowling and that‚Äôs it. I spent the rest of my weekend with Melissa.
 
So I have been upset about this, something I was going back and forth with myself about because even though I was tremously hurt, I was thinking I was being too selfish and self-absorbed. That I should just be thankful that she did something.
 
This next part was the final nail in the coffin for me. A couple weeks prior to all this Lana texted me about this band that was having a show. The lineup was a bunch of my favorite bands, she asked me if I wanted to go. I said, ‚Äòoh heck yeah.‚Äù She said, ‚Äúawesome me too, ill buy the tickets for your birthday.‚Äù The concert was one week after my birthday. I hadn‚Äôt talked to her for a couple days after my birthday, but I did text her on Thursday the 17th ‚Äòhey! Have you started listening to the other bands for Saturday?‚Äù her response: ‚Äòim not going anymore.‚Äù ME: ‚Äòoh‚Ä¶why not?‚Äù No response. ME: ‚Äòokay how much was my ticket? Ill Venmo you they are sold out.‚Äù Her response: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt buy them; I was going to buy them on your birthday but I forgot because all of the things I had to do that day.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond. We have not spoken since.
 
So this is why I am reaching out to reddit. I have told other people this to try and get her perspective of why she would be mad at me.  I haven‚Äôt even spoken to her yet about how all of this has upset me. I didn‚Äôt have an attitude at bowling. I didn‚Äôt make anything awkward, from my POV, it seems like she is upset that her plan was ruined by someone telling me. I have now been blocked on social media by her. I‚Äôm sure I am going to get some comments that I am being a brat and ungrateful but I can‚Äôt stop how I‚Äôm feeling about this and from the lack of response from her just solidifies things for me.
 
I know it‚Äôs a lot of details and I can‚Äôt even type everything from the past that has happened that is pushing me over the edge about this. I feel like trash because it feels like I just need to shove my own feelings down to make everything okay and this isn‚Äôt the first time I have felt like I had to do that.",1,1742920031.0,AmIOverreacting,3,0.67,False

Can someone share the best way to make either cold brew and/or iced coffee close to the way Starbucks does? What type of coffee blend, how it‚Äôs ground, etc. 

Edit - I‚Äôve tried the cold brew concentrate sold in stores and it doesn‚Äôt seem the same as the cold brew made in store. Also I know there is a difference between iced coffee and cold brew. I like either but tend to gravitate toward iced coffee ",1,1742919998.0,starbucks,1,1.0,False

I grew up rather awkward and realized that a lot of my approach anxiety stemmed from not knowing how to start the convo and having the skills to lead it towards getting the number.

Just like going to the gym and building muscle, I realized I would improve fastest if I had a low-pressure playground to practice my conversational skills. It was tougher to actually go outside and practice everyday, and I live in a small town so was scared of being judged.

So, I decided to spend a weekend creating a game that drops you into random social scenarios (like approaching a girl at the gym, a coffee shop, or on the street) and simulates the conversation with realistic voice AI. Each scenario has clear success or failure conditions, plus feedback on what you did well / tips to improve.

Hey there

Allow me to introduce myself‚ÄîI am a reserved yet passionate introvert, seeking to embark on a journey of meaningful connections and friendships. As I navigate this vast world, I have come to realize that life's true beauty lies in forging genuine bonds with like-minded individuals. Today, I take a leap of faith to reach out to this incredible community, in the hopes of finding some amazing female friends to share laughter, stories, and moments of deep understanding.

For me, the essence of friendship transcends the boundaries of small talk and shallow interactions. I yearn for connections that delve into the depths of our shared interests, dreams, and quirks. Though I may not be the loudest voice in a crowd, my heart carries the weight of empathy and compassion, making me a keen listener and a steadfast confidant. From the solace of a quiet coffee shop to the thrill of a thrilling book, I find solace in the simplicity of life's little wonders.

In a world that often glorifies extroversion, I firmly believe that introverts hold the power to nurture profound connections. There's something truly magical about the authenticity that arises when two introverted souls come together in understanding and harmony.

If you resonate with the idea of finding a friend who embraces the beauty of solitude and shares the joy of deep conversations, then I wholeheartedly invite you to join me on this journey. Let's explore the wonders of the universe through the lens of our unique perspectives and build a bond that defies the constraints of time and space.

Together, let's create a little corner of the world where introversion blooms and where friendship knows no boundaries. I eagerly await the opportunity to meet some incredible like-minded souls who can share in life's ups and downs, triumphs and tribulations, and everything in between.

Looking forward to connecting with you

If this is not the right forum and anybody else knows somewhere else I can post please let me know!

About two months ago, I started a coffee page for fun. I literally just wanted to place where I could post all the coffee shops I visit because my friends jokingly told me that I posted way too much on my regular page.

I only have like 100 followers but a lot of businesses use my content on their page using the Collab button so I easily get over 5000 views on each post 

My original username was coffee.shops_ (because I visit coffee shops) but someone DMd me yesterday, telling me that that username is ‚Äòvery confusing‚Äô cause they assumed I was a coffee shop.

So now I‚Äôm trying to figure out a username that kind of makes it clear that I‚Äôm visiting coffee shops. Can all you fellow coffee lovers help me lol",6,1742919851.0,Coffee_Shop,3,1.0,False

I apologize if this is not the correct sub, so please lmk. To try and keep it short, I (24F) work for an engineering company part time doing ad hock office work. Prior to this I was doing 911 dispatching for 3.5 years so it was an easy transition from high stress to low. I have no degree, flunked out in the first semester.


All this to say my job has an offer for me to work in a new position that has to do with grant work. They would obviously teach me the position but I would have to work full time. The pay could be upwards of 80k a year within a few years of working in the new position. The problem is, I‚Äôve been working on my mental health heavy since January. I started taking medication and doing trauma therapy, and I‚Äôm working on getting in to be seen for ADHD problems. And one of my biggest stressors is that I have no friends my age. And I know it seems silly but I really just want to work in a coffee shop and meet people my age. Instead of college, I started dispatching at 19. Now I‚Äôm 24 and I have one friend, plus my boyfriend. I really want to make connections with people but I fear I won‚Äôt be able to do it with the company I‚Äôm at, but I‚Äôm afraid to pass up the monetary opportunity, even if it means steady living and future.


So fellow anti-workers, should I prioritize my finances or my social life? Any advice is greatly appreciated.",2,1742919816.0,antiwork,0,1.0,False
