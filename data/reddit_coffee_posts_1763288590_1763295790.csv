1oykbw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianmedschool/comments/1oykbw9/were_final_year_students_stumbled_onto_something/,We’re final year students & stumbled onto something during burnout. Need honest opinions.,"This might be a 3-4 minute read, but I hope you’ll find it relatable.

So… me and my friends, all final-year MBBS students, were going through constant caffeine crash cycles. The jitters, the anxiety, the uncomfortable dip after coffee or energy drinks. We study all this in FMT, but facing it ourselves hit differently.

We started experimenting with different things that could help. That’s how we discovered matcha. It’s actually great, but honestly… we really couldn’t get used to the taste, and getting clean-label matcha in India isn’t easy.

Currently, we’re researching caffeine and L-theanine along with our institute’s pharma faculty. Maybe, if the writing turns out well, we might even publish a small paper since it’s our first research project. We tried L-theanine with coffee in proper, scientifically established ratios (lots of research already shows their synergy and alpha wave effects, but I won’t go deep here or this post will become too long).
But surprisingly… it worked. A lot.
We made our friends try it too, and they felt the same effects.

Around the same time a mental health survey team came to our campus. After interacting with them, we realised how common mental fatigue really is among medicos and far more than we expected.

So guys…
We’ve been thinking. Maybe we can’t eliminate mental fatigue fully, but one major reason behind it is definitely high uncontrolled caffeine intake and the crashes that follow. That part we can address.

We’re thinking of building something genuinely helpful, maybe even a brand, but a community driven one. Everyone studies differently, everyone’s brain works differently, so the needs of the community should be shaped by the community itself.

We’ve been formulating for the past three months, and honestly, finding the right proportions is tough. We don’t want to rely on artificial stuff. So we’re using natural ingredients only, like real fruit or flavour powders, because at the end of the day, non-maleficence is a principle we can’t ignore.
Alongside that, we’re reaching out to manufacturers, asking for caffeine analysis reports, talking to an L-theanine supplier (Suntheanine), and trying to understand the cleanest possible way to do this.
At the end of the day, we’re medicos, still learning.
All I know is that in our field, caffeine crashes are real and common.

We want to keep things minimal. No gimmicks like ashwagandha or focus herbs that take days to weeks to show effect. Just evidence-based stuff with full transparency and lab reports.

Many people around me say doctors shouldn’t do anything outside treatments, but honestly, if every other field is innovating, why can’t we?

I'm really sorry if this got long, but I wanted to share what’s been going on.

1oykax3,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_HotelHackHari/comments/1oykax3/no_sir_bookingcom_doesnt_work_for_us_we_work_for/,"No sir, Booking.com doesn’t work for us. We work for Booking.com apparently.","So I’m working front desk at a mid-range chain hotel, minding my business on a sleepy Tuesday night. A guy comes in, phone in hand, practically vibrating with indignation.

He slams his phone on the counter and barks, “I see this room for $109 online, why are YOU charging me $159?”

I do my usual polite spiel: “Sir, that’s the price on the OTA (Online Travel Agent). We don't control what they list; they set their own pricing based on algorithms, demand, God, I don't know.”

He stares at me like I just told him gravity is a scam.

“What do you mean you don’t control your OWN prices?”

So now I’m trying to explain that yes, we set a base rate, but OTAs (Online Travel Agencies like [Booking.com](http://Booking.com), Expedia, etc.) can, and do, apply their own markups, markdowns, coupon codes, or flash sales.

We literally log into their extranets and see rates we didn’t set. It’s like babysitting a toddler with a credit card and a Red Bull.

He then says the most peak-Karen thing I’ve heard all year:  
,  
**“You’re lying. It’s YOUR hotel. Of course you control what the internet says.”**

I wanted to say, “Sir, if I controlled the internet, I wouldn’t be here making $15.75 an hour watching grown adults try to cook rice in the coffee maker.”

Eventually, he booked the cheaper rate online, sat in our lobby for 10 minutes to get the confirmation, then smugly returned to the desk like he’d hacked the system.

Joke’s on him. The cheaper rate was non-refundable and didn’t include breakfast. I gave him a complimentary wake-up call at 6 am just to even the score.

**Moral of the story:** OTAs are the chaotic neutral middlemen of the hospitality world.

They’ll undercut you, oversell you, and leave hotels looking like they run the circus, while they’re quietly holding the whip behind the scenes.

Hotels don’t control OTA pricing. OTAs do.

She tells me “I’m terrified of living without you” AFTER the breakup. Is this love or trauma bonding?,"I’m 22M and my ex is 22F. We met at 16 and have been on-and-off for 6 years. She’s broken up with me six times for different reasons.

The 5th breakup was because I kissed another girl years ago, but ironically the year after that was our best year ever.

The 6th breakup is happening right now. I’m deployed in Djibouti for 4 months (military). She broke up with me during one of my guard shifts, while I was alone in a tower for hours — something I have to do 6 times a week. I still have 3 weeks left before returning home.

Her reasons this time:
	•	she “can’t forgive who I was 5 years ago,” even though I’ve changed
	•	she moved to Paris and is “re-evaluating her whole life, including me”
	•	she says my “environment” is the problem
	•	she says she doesn’t know if we’ll get back together — but says it almost casually

What’s confusing is what happened AFTER the breakup:
A few weeks later, she told me things like “I’m terrified of living without you.”
This is after she ended things — not before. She also made a lot of promises before I left for deployment, but the day she arrived in Paris, she suddenly questioned everything about us. All her intentions flipped overnight.

More context:
She hit me once, hard enough to leave marks. I forgave her immediately.
Before this breakup, I was so attached to her that I seriously considered giving up all my professional goals — including a special forces path I’ve been preparing for over a year — just to move to Paris for her. It scared me how quickly I was willing to sacrifice everything.

We still text/call occasionally, but we’re trying to “reduce contact” until I return.

When I come back, she wants to “grab a coffee.”
Last time that happened after a breakup, it turned into drinking all night, I slept at her place, and we acted like we were together again.

She also made me a personalized mug with “I love you” written at the bottom and tried to give it to me. I refused because I’m tired of mixed signals.

I still love her, but I don’t know why anymore. Since the breakup I’ve had panic attacks, needed anxiolytics, and started therapy. I’m preparing for special forces selection and this whole situation is messing with my head.

Should I even meet her?
Is this love, trauma bonding, or just fear of abandonment?

I've been with my partner for 5 years and to say it's been a rollercoaster would be an understatement. A few days ago I described his behaviors to ChatGPT and that's how I found out about OCPD. Before that, I was encouraging him to get assessed for Autism, but now I see that he's textbook OCPD. After years of emotional abuse, I'm trying to decide now to move forward. I don't need advice; just wanted to share and see who else can relate... 

I hope this makes you feel less alone. 

**Things he does/did:** 

\- **Laundry obsession.** I'm not allowed to wash his clothes anymore because I don't do it the right way with exactly the right settings. After countless fights, this is the only solution. He has VERY strict (and absurd, imo) rules about how clothes should be washed and dried. 

\- **No cooking in the house.** I love cooking. I like eating healthy, homemade food. I like onions and garlic. Love Indian food. I'm not allowed to cook it. He didn't explicitly forbid it, but it's not worth the passive aggressive behavior, so I stopped. He complains about the smells, complains about the number of dishes and appliances I have, and doesn't eat any of the food I cook. 

\- **Berates me for having ""too much stuff**"", especially in the kitchen. I have two small cupboards that I use for canned beans, flour, sugar, coffee, and spices. Because these are things he doesn't use, he thinks it's ridiculous that I have them. We've had fights about how ridiculous it is that I insist on keeping this stuff.  

A couple months ago, after yet another fight, I packed up 70% of my possessions (clothes, shoes, books, appliances, decorative items) and moved them into storage. Now i feel like I can't live in my own home. 

\- **Explosive rage** about things being out of place. When we moved into our apartment and hadn't unpacked, I accidentally left a pair of pants on the bathroom floor. I was exhausted from the move and literally forgot. Tried to explain. Zero empathy. Name-calling, door slamming and verbal abuse ensued. I googled dv hotlines and packed a bag. 

\- **Controls what I buy.** I don't buy much, but whenever I buy clothes and shoes for myself, he gets upset if I don't show him right away. He says it's because he likes to be involved and is genuinely curious, buuuut it feels controlling. He gets unreasonably upset. I've grown to resent this and now go out of my way to hide things from him. It's my life. I don't owe him this. I keep my sheepskin slippers in a drawer and wear them he's not home lol. 

**- Road rage & dangerous driving.** Other drivers frequently piss him off. Often to the point where he will chase someone down until he can drive beside them, rolls down the window and screams at them. People are baffled. I have feared for my life several times.  
  
**-Thinks he's always right.** Just in general, with everything. Believes that his worldview is the only correct one and everyone else is an idiot. Before I understood OCPD, it used to baffle me how judgemental and unempathetic he was.  

It might seem like I'm painting a picture of a monster here but he's not. He has a sweet, caring side. Which is why I haven't left yet. Trauma bond! ",3,1763295267.0,LovedByOCPD,0,1.0,False
1oyk80e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1oyk80e/bitter_and_sour_shots/,Bitter and Sour shots,"**Hello fellas,**

I’m back once again looking for some help and tips regarding the Cafelat Robot.

I’m completely new to espresso, this is my first machine and the only one I’ve ever used for specialty coffee. A few days ago I asked for help because I couldn’t even get a shot out of the Robot when following the Kingrinder K6 grind table. Thankfully that’s sorted now, and I’m able to pull shots in around 25 seconds with a 5-second preinfusion.

**The issue:** every shot tastes bitter *and* sour. I’m not experienced enough to say which one dominates, but sometimes it genuinely feels like both at once.

**My current workflow:**

* Dose: 18g and 20g (tried both)
* Ratio: 1:2
* Grinder: Kingrinder K6
* Water straight off the boil
* Fill the basket as recommended
* 5-second preinfusion at \~2 bar
* Slow ramp to \~6 bar and hold until I reach my target output
* Tried longer preinfusions and longer shot times — taste is always the same
* I use a toothpick as a WDT tool, currently waiting for a better one to arrive, I've seen Paul do WDT with a screwdriver so I don't think that is the issue

**Coffee:**  
This one, roasted on **November 11th** (very fresh):  
[https://nomadcoffee.es/en/products/womens-crown](https://nomadcoffee.es/en/products/womens-crown)

I know coffee usually needs to rest for about a week, but this is what I have for now.

**Questions:**

* Is the taste due to the coffee being too fresh?
* Am I tamping incorrectly?
* Could this be channeling?
* Or something else I might be overlooking?

One more thing I noticed: at the end of the shot, the crema has some brown oily-looking spots, almost like actual brown oil drops falling into the cup.

Thanks a lot for reading and for your help!

It was post Covid times, flights traveling was very strict with lots of test, one hand distance between passenger and alternative seats , mask and constant fear..

This traveling for my solo travelling cum profession related work too and fro between Bangalore and Mumbai.. 

This was my first visit to Mumbai and was very much excited and cautious.
Late night flight delayed by 45 minutes and just asked one of the co passenger enquiring about probably taxi option and food option in Mumbai post landing...

Conversation continued and flight was barely filled so managed to sit sit in same row witha sit empty in between...

We talked a lot about our profession, necessity of traveling Even in those scary times..She was a doctor and she explained a lot about Covid infection and what's the global vaccine status and best life style to keep our immunity High ..our number exchanged at the end of journey.  

Conversation started with important diseases and medicine update and sharing healthy life style standards and practices...later turned in to friendly conversation and video calling whenever free to every day night before bed..

After an year of all this .. fortunately my office asked me to complete the work in Mumbai by staying there for months. I wholeheartedly accepted the instruction and flying to Mumbai with lots of hopes and expectations...

Covid restrictions were reduced.. we started meeting everyday evening for coffee and fruits near to her hospital..lots of lots conversation, deep discussion about life and humanity..

Knowingly unknowingly we were dependent on each other, we both knew too much emotional attachment is not always good at the end ..

One day she invited me to her family function where I experienced the orthodox conservative vibe from her family...I was very sceptical between us because we both belong to different belief and community...She some how ready to tackle her family for this relation but I felt just for me she gonna loose all her family connections...I said No ...she was very upset initially and later she understood the severity of the matter at present condition in today's society...

Back to friends and busy with our own personal and professional life ...now we no longer talk and She is getting married soon ..

The incident tonight in short is that she had a hugely (genuinely absurdly) disproportionate reaction to something I said. We were out for the drink talking about random topics. Got onto the topic of parenting styles and how I would raise kids if I ever had them etc. I admit I have grown resentful of her in some aspects especially as I got older.

She brought up our dad (divorced) and how she feels wronged that she raised us on her own and has to hear all these “complaints”, whereas my dad left us when we were kids and doesn’t have to hear any of the “complaints”. I said actually I have had conversations with dad where I told him my grievances about him and that he’s actually cried and apologised to me (which she laughed at - ie the conversation was still amicable and friendly at this point). 

I said, well then you should know how I feel. Because I too try really hard and do a real good job as a daughter but have to constantly hear her criticise and mock me (helping her buy a house, me and my sister pay her 700 a month EACH toward the mortgage, we’re independent, have good jobs, don’t party or do drugs etc, visit her every few weeks). She challenged me saying what has she ever said that is hurtful. I recounted how I asked her if she was proud of me about the job I landed and she had responded that why should she be proud, it’s good for me not her, and that sometimes she wished we hadn’t succeeded so much in life, that the incompetent ones stay by the parents’ side. 

This is the comment that made her flip the switch. She threw her coffee on the ground and walked home. When I got home she tried to throw all my stuff out of the house and dragged me by my hair to try get me out of the house. I resisted and she’s allowed me to stay overnight and leave in the morning. She hit we all over my face and head with her fists. She screamed at me that she will never see me again. She says that I’m ungrateful and a bitch for interpreting what she said in such a dramatic way. She doesn’t deny saying it but says I twisted her words. I believe her reaction comes from me attacking her identity as a mother - which I wasn’t intending to do but I appreciate it was an inherent suggestion of what I was saying. 

I begged on my literal knees and apologised for ever thinking that. I said everything I could to appease her but she maintains that she will never see me again. 

Problem is that if she does this to me, she will do the same to my sister despite her not even being here when all of this happened. She can disown me and it my fault, but how will I ever make up for ruining my sister’s relationship with our mum through no fault of her own. ",1,1763294546.0,AITAH,5,1.0,False

We went over to our friend's house last night for dinner. She's a single mom, and we played games with her daughter and tried to take some of the burden off of her for a few hours. We left, went home to our dogs, cuddled up, watched an 80s movie, and drank tea. 

Today will be filled with beach walks and shell collecting, artwork, reading, naps, delicious food, and good conversation. And every weekend morning I wake up in this peaceful, child-free life, I am grateful.

For some background and context I am original from Japan but my family immigrated here when i was fifteen, and we moved around alot but we finally settled in a place at the beginning of the year.

Thats when I ment my boyfriend 30M let's just call him Darius, I just got off a bad long distance relationship and wasn't keen to date anyone (but that is a story for a different day), but a just a few weeks into living in L.A I ment Darius at a coffee shop, it was unusually because I was at a table just enjoying my coffee when he walked over and sat down with me, sliding a coffee he bought over to me, and I could tell he was into me but I didn't want to blow him off because he was nice and bought me coffee, so I sat there and talked with him.

Darius was charming and nice but it was painful obvious he was into me, and he even invited me to come to a party tonight with a couple of his friends, and I said yes, but I had intentions of not showing up, but after leaving the coffee shop and agreeing my conscience got the best of me amd I ended up showing up, And the night was amazing, Darius seemed genuinely interested in me, and getting to know me, so at the end of the night we exchanged numbers and became friends.

Ater that night We went on a date where he seemed into all the same things I was, K-pop, anime, all that type of stuff, sweet, kind, caring, so I gave him a shot and after a couple more dates we made things official.

Now thats all out the way I can bring up why I am here, just last week I officially moved in with Darius, and it was amazing, until last night.

We made dinner yesterday to go to a restaurant for dinner, but about an hour before we were about to go he told me he was heading out with his friends tonight, so I got pissed and got up and told him that's unfair and we already made plans tonight, and he cant just bail on that.

Thats when he shoved me hard, making me stumble backwards fall back onto the couch, then ge got in my face yelling that I cant control him, and he can do what he wants, and he is going out with his friends tonight if I like it or not.

I was scared and stunned, because he had never raised his voice at me, or shoved me, so I went quiet and nodded, he then said good grabbed his coat and walked to the door saying that Im gonna make it up to him and his friends for making him late, he then left and hasn't been back since, and im worried I was in the wrong, to set him off, because he has never been like this.

So, AITA for telling him he cant Bail on are plans?",1,1763294352.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False
1oyjy3e,https://i.redd.it/410lrpj7zl1g1.jpeg,"🇺🇸 Trump Cuts Tariffs on Coffee, Bananas, Beef & More in Bid to Lower Grocery Prices","President Donald Trump has rolled back tariffs on a wide range of everyday food imports — including **coffee, cocoa, bananas, beef, tea, tomatoes, avocados, oranges, pineapples, and more** — after months of political pressure over rising grocery costs.

The move marks a **major reversal** from his earlier tariff strategy, which targeted many of the same items and contributed to price spikes across U.S. supermarkets.

**📉 Why the reversal now?**

Trump has faced growing backlash as staples like beef, coffee, chocolate, and produce have surged in price.  
With food inflation already hitting households for years, his own tariff hikes added an extra layer of cost across the supply chain.

According to CPI data:

* **Food-at-home prices are up \~2.7% YoY**
* **Coffee prices surged \~21% YoY**
* **Chocolate up nearly 30%**
* **Uncooked beef jumped 12–18% YoY**

Several major trade partners — including **Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and Uruguay** — faced tariffs of 50–75%+ under Trump’s earlier policy, directly driving up consumer prices.

Friday’s action removes duties on many items **not produced in sufficient quantities in the U.S.**, like bananas, coffee, tea, and cocoa.

**🥩 Beef: Tight supply and huge tariff pressure**

U.S. cattle herds are at a **75-year low**, and high tariffs on global beef exporters pushed costs even higher.  
With drought, feed costs, and tariffs on fertilizer and metals hurting ranchers, beef prices exploded.

Producers say policy “whiplash” has made long-term planning nearly impossible.

**☕ Coffee: One of the hardest-hit categories**

Brazil supplies **one-third** of U.S. coffee imports — and faced **50% tariffs**, which roasters passed down to consumers.  
Coffee reached the highest U.S. retail price ever recorded:

* **$8.41/lb** (up 33% YoY)
* Global prices are still near **50-year highs**

Because the U.S. produces *zero* commercial coffee domestically, tariffs had nowhere to go except into final prices.

**🍫 Cocoa & chocolate: High tariffs + crop failures**

Cocoa has been crushed by three years of poor harvests in West Africa — then hit with U.S. tariffs on top.  
Even after a correction, futures remain **double** pre-pandemic levels.  
Hershey projected **$160–$170M in tariff costs** this year alone.

**🌎 Why now? Election pressure + new trade deals**

The move comes one day after Trump announced new trade framework agreements with **Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Ecuador**, with tariffs of 10–15% on most goods — *but exemptions* for products the U.S. cannot supply itself.

It’s also a political moment: rising food prices have been one of the biggest voter complaints this year.

**📌 Bottom line**

Trump is partially reversing his own tariff strategy to cool grocery prices ahead of continued consumer frustration.  
While experts say the exemptions **will help at the margins**, global supply issues in coffee, beef, and cocoa mean prices won’t fully normalize overnight.

Still, this marks one of the **biggest shifts in Trump’s trade policy** since he returned to office.",2,1763294328.0,insiderData,2,1.0,False

1oyjxh6,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1oyjxh6/what_type_of_equipment_do_you_need_to_have_a/,What type of equipment do you need to have a super fast workflow for lattes? [$1300],"Hey guys!
considering getting new equipment, more than machine recommendations I'm looking for recordation of specs I should have in a machine I choose 

I want to be able to make lattes quickly. Under 1.5 minutes Once I'm at the coffee station

Medium to dark or dark roasts only 

The flow I'm thinking is 
- start frothing the milk (ghost steaming or auto if machine has )
- grind beans directly into portafilter
- tamp etc and prepare to make  espresso 
- finalize milk frothing, and start pouring espresso 

Background: I started with a df54 and Solis barista prefetta . Was able to make really good coffee but the total time it took (from taking out milk to cleaning the counter when done) was 7 to 8 minutes when I did everything right and rushed it. I drink latte after breakfast and with all the rush that's just not an acceptable amount of time . Replaced this with a delonghi but I'm not that satisfied  so want to add a semi automatic setup again but need a super fast workflow 

Budget is 1300, flexible and that doesn't mean much. My location is UAE so many brands aren't here but can be imported with relative ease (got my df54 from Alibaba, delonghi from Amazon Italy with negligible shipping, my solis at sale for ~$200

For the benefit of this community, here's a couple things I learned:

\- Vercel is a good place to host your final project. However, if you're going to use it, start from \*their\* template. Its not \*that\* different from the Flask template that you learn in lecture, but there are a few non-obvious configuration details that need to be set up, and you'll lose time debugging if you try to start from your working app that you run with \`http-server\` on the codespace and expect it to work out-of-the-box on Vercel.

\- If you're going to use a database, choose a hosting service like Supabase (thats not the only one, but its what I used). Its arguably easier to use than setting up a bare-bones SQL database like is taught in lecture. You won't be able to easily persist the data from your \`.db\` file in the same folder as your scripts anyway, so better to just find a cloud service from the start.

# Understanding the Ketogenic Diet

A ketogenic diet is a dietary approach that focuses on high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate intake. This unique composition is designed to put the body into a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for energy instead of carbohydrates.

**The principles of a ketogenic diet** are straightforward: it involves drastically reducing the intake of carbohydrates and replacing them with fat. This significant change in dietary composition can lead to various health benefits, including weight loss and improved blood sugar control.

When following a ketogenic diet, it's essential to focus on **keto-friendly meals** that are rich in healthy fats, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates. Examples include meals with avocados, nuts, fatty fish, and plenty of green vegetables.



**Healthy eating on keto** is not just about cutting carbs; it's also about making sure you're getting the right nutrients. It's crucial to choose high-quality foods, including grass-fed meats, organic vegetables, and healthy oils, to ensure you're getting a balanced diet.

Think of iconic café scenes in romantic films or characters who are never without a cup in hand. Coffee represents creativity, comfort, and connection, making it a beloved aesthetic worldwide.

Social Media celebrate coffee through aesthetic photography—moody café corners, latte art, warm filters, and cozy vibes. Coffee has become a symbol of slow living and mindful moments.

Music videos, books, and fashion trends often feature coffee as a lifestyle accessory. Oversized sweaters, journals, and latte-filled mornings have become part of a broader cultural mood.

Coffee isn’t just a beverage; it’s an identity. It represents warmth, routine, creativity, and personal space. Its influence continues to grow, inspiring millions to find beauty in the little moments.

1oyjlq2,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1oyjlq2/how_to_stay_mentally_sharp_underrated_hacks_that/,How to stay mentally sharp: underrated hacks that make your brain age BACKWARDS,"Ever feel like your brain’s running on 2G in a 5G world? Yeah, same. I kept noticing how quickly people around me lose focus, forget names, can’t finish a book, or get brain fog after minimal effort. And it’s not just aging folks  even people in their 20s and 30s complain about “mental burnout” or having a “mushy brain.” It’s everywhere. I dug deep into this because I’ve spent years researching cognitive performance, behavioral science, and knowledge optimization (yes, actual academic stuff), and the amount of low-quality or flat-out wrong advice online  especially from TikTok brain-hack influencers  is wild.

“Just drink mushroom coffee and do a cold plunge at 5am.” No. That’s not biohacking. That’s just freeze-dried dopamine chasing.

Here’s a no-BS breakdown of what actually works to stay mentally sharp, based on real science, expert-backed tools, and vetted resources.

Let’s talk brain gains.

 Habits that actually keep your brain young and fast

\- Read outside your algorithm bubble  

  Reading deeply and diversely keeps your neural pathways flexible. In The Real World Brain Health report by AARP (2023), experts emphasized how reading fiction, especially literary fiction, forces your brain to work harder to predict characters and story arcs, strengthening theory of mind and memory. Ditch TikTok captions. Pick up Murakami.

\- Use spaced repetition + active recall  

  Instead of rereading or highlighting (which your brain loves because it feels easy), test yourself. The Make It Stick research crew (Roediger, Brown, McDaniel) showed that retrieval practice beats passive review by a huge margin. Apps like Anki or using flashcards in physical notebooks rewire memory more than passive summarizing.

\- Whole-body movement boosts whole-brain strength  

  According to a 2021 Harvard Health study, aerobic exercise (like dancing, swimming, even brisk walking) increases hippocampus volume  aka your brain’s memory center. You don’t need Barry’s Bootcamp. Just move daily in a way that gets your heart rate up.

\- Ditch multitasking. Embrace deep work.  

  Dr. Gloria Mark, professor of informatics, found that the average person switches screens every 47 seconds. That destroys working memory. Go for “monotasking blocks” instead. 90 minutes of focused work with breaks leads to more productivity and mental clarity than the “always-on” chaos.

\- Guard your sleep like it’s your most expensive software  

  Sleep isn’t just rest. It’s cognitive upload time. In Why We Sleep, neuroscientist Matthew Walker shows that deep sleep is when our brain consolidates learning, solves problems, detoxes waste, and resets attention. Less than 7 hours? You’re not sharp. You’re just surviving.

 Tools that actually help (and don’t waste your time)

\- Finch  

  This is NOT your average productivity app. Finch turns your daily wellness tasks into a game with a virtual pet you raise by doing things like journaling, stretching, or checking off learning goals. It’s super dopamine-friendly without being addictive. Helps build habits that stick.

\- BeFreed  

  Absolute gamechanger if you want to boost brainpower on a busy schedule. Built by a team from Columbia University, it takes real research, expert podcasts, and book summaries to create a personalized audio learning plan just for you. You choose your goal (like sharpening memory or decision-making), pick how long you want the podcast to be (10, 20, or 40 minutes), and even select your host’s voice.  

  What’s cool is, it tracks what you listen to, then adapts your learning roadmap over time. I’ve used it to go deep into cognitive psychology and behavioral change, and it covers all the books I recommend below. Easily one of the best platforms for making daily brain training automatic and fun.

 Must-read books that supercharge your mental fitness

\- “Peak” by Anders Ericsson  

  This book will make you rethink everything about talent. Ericsson was the psychologist behind the 10,000-hour rule, but he clarifies it’s not just about time  it’s about deliberate practice. Crushes myths about IQ and innate ability. One of the best books on cognitive skill-building I’ve ever read.



\- “The Extended Mind” by Annie Murphy Paul  

  A New York Times bestseller that blew my mind. She shows how we think better using the environment, our bodies, and even gestures  not just our brains. After this, you’ll never look at your desk or walking routine the same way. Insanely good read for creative thinkers.



\- “Stolen Focus” by Johann Hari  

  This one shook me. Hari exposes how systemic and tech-driven factors are killing our attention spans  but also gives real, hopeful solutions. It’s not preachy or anti-tech. Just smart. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity.



\- “Moonwalking with Einstein” by Joshua Foer  

  Pulitzer-winning journalist becomes a memory champion in one year. It’s fun, freaky, and surprisingly emotional. Teaches you how to use memory palaces and mental imagery like the memory athletes. Basically brain gym, but not boring.



\- “Your Brain at Work” by David Rock  

  Written for people who want to do more, remember better, and stress less. Rock explains how your brain reacts under pressure at work, and how small mental shifts (like labeling emotions or reframing decisions) can improve focus instantly.

 Secret weapons to improve recall, clarity and focus

\- Mind palaces (yes, Sherlock-level stuff)  

  Research from Radboud University (2017) found that memory athletes use spatial visualization more than rote repetition. You can train this. Build a mental room where each object represents a concept. Practice with grocery lists, then scale up to dense ideas.

\- Meditation that’s not boring or woo-woo  

  Look up Sam Harris’ Waking Up series or the podcast Ten Percent Happier. Modern mindfulness backed by neuroscience. Meditation literally thickens the prefrontal cortex and shrinks the amygdala, which helps focus and impulse control. No third eye required.

\- Curate your inputs like your brain depends on it  

  Follow smarter people. YouTube channels like Veritasium, The School of Life, or Andrew Huberman’s podcast feed your dopamine and cognition. Stay off drama rabbit holes. You’re not out of touch. You’re just protecting your processing power.

Learning isn’t just for students. Mental sharpness isn’t about IQ. It’s about skill-stacking, daily brain hygiene, and actual working memory exercises. These tools help you age smarter, not just slower.",2,1763293167.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False

Both bands spent a ton of time talking about how strong the hardcore community is—accepting, supportive, looking out for each other, all that. 

But someone smashed into my car (BMW M240i) parked on Oak st. and didn’t leave a note. I didn’t notice it until the next morning, and honestly it took the wind out of me. To have it damaged by someone from a scene that prides itself on accountability and respect… doesn’t exactly line up with the message from the stage.

If anyone saw anything, please reach out. There’s white paint transferred onto my car from the impact. There was a white Suburban with MA plates parked behind me, but my cameras didn’t catch the actual hit, so I can’t say for sure.

Just disappointing. I expected more from people who preach community.

*By Your Humble AI Sportswriter, Wielding a Keyboard Like a Juggler Wields Spaghetti*

---

**Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
AD Ceuta FC enters Sunday’s clash as the slight favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **2.4** (implying a **41.7% implied probability** of victory). Leganés, meanwhile, is priced at **3.1** (**32.3%**), while the draw sits at **2.8** (**35.7%**). These numbers suggest a tightly contested match, but Ceuta’s home form—4 wins, 0 draws, 1 loss this season—gives them a statistical edge. Their defense, which has kept **4 clean sheets in 5 games**, is as reliable as a Swiss watchmaker’s coffee schedule. Leganés, on the other hand, has lost two straight and scored in just **60% of their last five matches**, which is about as prolific as a baker who forgets to add yeast.

The **Under 2.5 goals** market is a lock, with Ceuta averaging **2.2 goals per game** and Leganés a meager **1.8**. Combined, they’re as explosive as a wet firework. Corners? Expect fewer than 10.5, since Ceuta averages **4.2** and Leganés **4.7**—together, they’re about as likely to flood the pitch with set pieces as a desert is to host a swimming pool.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Pressure, and a Touch of Tragedy**  
Ceuta’s recent **2-0 loss to Córdoba** ended an eight-game unbeaten streak, but their defense remains a fortress. They’ve conceded just **3 goals in their last five games**—a dramatic improvement from their early-season leakiness. Star players appear healthy, though their offense still relies on the same tired scripts as a Netflix algorithm stuck on *How I Met Your Mother*.

Leganés, meanwhile, is a pressure-cooker. Manager **Paco López** is on the hot seat after two consecutive losses, and their attack sputters like a car with a flat tire and a b

As in the title, my great great grandfather was a foundling from Messina. His birth record is linked to this post. Transcriptions from a past kind Redditor is below, followed by a rough Google translation to English. 

I would really love to try and learn more about foundlings of that time, and more specifically the exact places he may have been abandoned/discovered (, if they still exist, or what they may have looked like back then.

Getting a drink and a good book and reading

1oyjeq3,https://i.redd.it/beohf0zmtl1g1.jpeg,LinkedIn's AI new search actually works and I'm mad I didn't know sooner.,"So I accidentally found this yesterday and it's been bugging me that nobody told me about it.

LinkedIn added this AI search thing. I know, I know - another AI feature that probably sucks. But this one doesn't. And I'm annoyed because it would've saved me SO much time.

# What it does

You just type what you want. Like talking to a person.

Instead of clicking a million filters, I typed: ""people who switched from engineering to product management""

Boom. 47 people who actually did that exact thing.

Not 5000 random results. Not people who kinda match. People who literally did what I'm trying to do.

# Why this matters

I've been trying to break into PM for months. Spent hours searching LinkedIn the normal way. You know the drill - click Industry, then Location, then Job Title, then get overwhelmed and give up.

With this? Found 3 people to talk to in like 5 minutes. Already had coffee chats with them. Got actual advice.

# Other stuff that worked

Just type normal sentences:

""Find investors in healthcare who used to be doctors""

""People at Google who came from startups""

""UX designers in Austin who freelance""

It just... works. Finally.

# The annoying parts

**You need Premium.** Yeah, it costs money. US only right now too.

**It's not perfect.** Sometimes it gets confused. But honestly it's still better than the old way.

**Privacy stuff.** LinkedIn is using our data to train this. You can turn it off in Settings > Data Privacy > Data for Generative AI Improvement.

I turned it off, then turned it back on because the search is actually useful. Your call though.

# How to use it

If you have Premium, look at the search bar. It should say ""I'm looking for..."" instead of just ""Search.""

If you don't see it, they haven't given it to you yet. It's rolling out slowly.

# Bottom line

I usually hate when companies add AI to stuff. It's always useless.

This isn't.

If you've ever spent an hour searching LinkedIn and found nobody good, try this. It's the first LinkedIn feature in years that actually helps.

So, today I woke up feeling insanely horny and bored- my boyfriend's out of town, and I just couldn't sit around doing nothing.
I threw on my red one-piece and went to the café, feeling... electric, honestly. I sat in a corner and, I don't know why but, I slid my dress a little lower exposing my cleavage just a bit more. Could feel a few people staring, and it just made me hotter. I was using my phone and enjoying my coffee. Then this one guy finally got the courage to come over. He said hi, complimented me. His eyes were on my cleavage and that was making me even more hornier. I slid a hajd through my hairs and this led to my boobs getting exposed a bit more. He was trying really hard not to look there but I knew I had him hooked. We talked a bit and I just gave him my Instagram with a teasing little smile. And wow... I loved it.

i was out with two of my friends grabbing coffee. i was dressed normally, literally nothing wild, just an oversized jacket, hair done decently, some light makeup bc i like looking put together when i leave the house.
apparently that was my first crime.

we’re waiting in line and this girl (early 20s maybe?) taps me on the shoulder and goes “omg your whole vibe is so cute, i love your jacket and your hair looks amazing.”
super sweet, honestly made my entire morning.

her bf, who is literally RIGHT there, stiffens up like a statue and goes “can we just order?”
like… aggressively. as if her complimenting another girl was a personal attack on him.

she looks at him like he’s being stupid and i kinda awkward-laugh and go “calm down dude it’s just a compliment??”
and THIS MAN legit scoffs and calls me an attention seeker 💀
for doing… absolutely nothing??

my friends said i should’ve ignored it but like i wasn’t prepared for that olympic-level insecurity. i wasn’t flirting, i wasn’t trying to get noticed, i was just standing there with a jacket and a face.

later one of my friends goes “tbh you have resting b face and you seem too confident so you probably intimidate some people, maybe his gf felt compared or whatever.”
so apparently i’m the problem because i had good hair today??? ok.

now i’m thinking maybe i shouldn’t have said anything back but also… why am i expected to babysit random men’s egos??

You're not alone! Homeowners across Butte County are turning their kitchens into warm, welcoming spaces that blend comfort, function, and personality. Whether you're dreaming of a modern vibe or a rustic charm, there are plenty of creative ideas to bring your vision to life. Here are some inspiring kitchen makeover ideas locals can’t stop loving.

**1. Open Concept Layouts**  
Tear down those barriers—literally. Many Butte County homeowners are choosing open-concept kitchens that flow seamlessly into living and dining areas. This not only creates a spacious feeling but also makes entertaining easier and more social. Goodbye, isolated cook!

**2. Natural Light is a Must**  
Bright, airy kitchens never go out of style. Adding large windows or even a skylight can completely transform the atmosphere. Light makes the space feel bigger, cleaner, and more inviting—something Butte County residents appreciate with all that natural California sunshine.

**3. Earthy and Neutral Color Palettes**  
Shades of beige, soft gray, and muted greens are incredibly popular in the region. These colors reflect the natural beauty of the surrounding environment while adding a timeless appeal to the kitchen. Accent with wooden cabinets or exposed beams for added warmth.

**4. Functional Island Installations**  
An island isn’t just for show—it’s the heart of a modern kitchen. Locals are loving islands with built-in sinks, hidden storage, and space for seating. Whether it’s a prep station or a morning coffee spot, islands are a top feature in today’s makeovers.

**5. Smart Storage Solutions**  
Decluttering is key. Pull-out drawers, vertical pantry space, lazy Susans, and hidden compartments are all in demand. With smarter storage, every pot, pan, and spatula has a home—making daily cooking less of a chore and more of a joy.

**6. Stylish Backsplashes**  
Homeowners are using backsplashes as a canvas for creativity. Think colorful tiles, textured patterns, or even reclaimed materials. It’s a small detail that makes a big impact, allowing you to express your personality without overwhelming the space.

**7. Eco-Friendly Updates**  
From energy-efficient lighting to water-saving fixtures, eco-conscious designs are trending in Butte County. Sustainable choices help lower bills and reduce your carbon footprint—plus, they boost long-term home value.

**8. Cozy Breakfast Nooks**  
A built-in bench, a small table, and some comfy cushions—voilà! Breakfast nooks are becoming a favorite kitchen corner for families to gather and slow down in the morning rush.

In the world of **home renovation Butte County** residents truly shine when it comes to transforming kitchens into spaces that blend style and purpose. By focusing on open spaces, natural elements, and smart features, your kitchen can become the most-loved room in your home. Whether you go big or start small, the right upgrades can completely re-energize your space.",1,1763291733.0,TheCreativeContent,0,1.0,False

I'm a home barista and iOS developer, and over the last year I've been working on a small side project that grew into a full app: an iOS app called Liquid Coffee. The app is free with limited features, and a subscription is required to unlock the full feature set.

The main idea is pretty simple: I wanted a clean way to log my espresso shots and tasting notes in one place.

Right now the app can: 

\- Log espresso shots with dose, yield, time, temperature, grinder, date and beans

\- Store tasting notes and cupping style scores

\- Export your data as a PDF report to share or archive

\- Sync data across apple devices with iCloud

I’ve also started working on building a coffee/bean database so I can add a “coffee discovery” section where you can browse coffees and keep track of what you’ve tried.

I’d really like feedback from people who pull espresso at home more seriously than the average user:

\- Which parameters do you actually care about tracking day to day?

\- Do you find cupping-style scoring useful for espresso, or is it overkill?

\- What would you expect from a “coffee discovery” section so it’s more than just another bean list?

If this kind of app sounds useful to, here’s the App Store link:

It’s just to help you get to know me before you message.

I’m Max and as the title states, I’m looking for a ride or die. Maybe that’s just through being friends, maybe that’s through something deeper? I’m open to that and everything between.
I’m posting as my social circle has shrunk quite a lot recently. I’ve recently returned from a gap year working as a volunteer teacher in China and I’ve lost contact with a lot of folk so I’m trying to build my connections up again.

I’m a pretty perfect split between being an introvert and an extrovert. I love getting cosy, curling up with a good cup of coffee, some movies or a book or even just staring out my window, headphones on, and watch the world go by. On the other hand, I yearn for the outdoors. If I’m not roaming the hills and forests with my camera, I’m almost certainly running or cycling miles along the roads, and I’ve got some beautiful scenery to do it in. I run both for leisure and competitively and I’m just beginning a training block for an upcoming challenge next year.
I’m also into creative writing and poetry if there’s anyone else who’s interested in that!

If looks matter to you, I’m 6’0, pretty lanky but still fit, dark brown hair that’s in some kind of a messy fringe and blue eyes (that are apparently miley cyrus blue, whatever that means?)

I don’t ask for a lot in people, but honesty goes a long way. Otherwise just be yourself, however bubbly or serious that may be. If you think we’ll click, don’t sit on the other side of the screen and wonder what could be - find out and tell me a bit about yourself!

I’m happy to chat through Reddit or move to another platform if and when you’re comfortable and I’ve got no issue with sharing pictures. I’m also a pretty open book so if there’s anything that’s caught your eye here that you want to ask about, please do!

Hope everyone who reads this has a great day and I look forward to meeting people soon! :)",3,1763291057.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1oyiwq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1oyiwq1/struggling_with_adult_friendship/,Struggling with adult friendship,"Hi, 

I am 35F from Delhi. I and husband 40M moved from Delhi to a small town in Himachal 5 years ago. I changed my career, we left everything and started new here. This was the first time husband and I lived alone so I was really looking forward to it.

But things didn't go as planned 

I struggle big time making friends here. There are people who are also from cities settled here but things just didn't work out. I am sure i am going wrong somewhere but here's my perception of things:

First, I felt people are not welcoming to newer people, they kind of feel like joint family to me. Since you moved later, they want you to respect the seniority. They want you to put efforts which i really did but still things didn't move forward.

Most people are living with partners, so it's forced couple friendship that feels like kitty party. I tried extending one to one friendship with some girls, but either it's pura group or couple couple.

I am sort of a nerd, I work very seriously, very grateful for my job, i have grandma hobbies like sewing, cooking, gardening etc so eventually I find less things to talk about. I am open to having friends who aren't similar because I have often had friends who are very different to me but I somehow feel people discard me because I don't know of things they talk of (series, movies, INSTAGRAM, memes)

I like alcohol, but it's always been a means for more things. Not the actual thing. People meet to drink alcohol here. They talk about the past episodes where they had alcohol and someone got sloshed. Or they talk of 'bahut pee liya' 'xyz pee nai raha' 'abc ko pilao'. I am somehow not enjoying this and feel I am abusing alcohol for nothing great.

I am bit conscious of people's space, I know I am too inhibited but I am like this until I am quite comfortable with people. So I don't call randomly or visit their homes randomly so I could never take friendship a step ahead.

If I invite people. They never turn up...they usually cancel last day or just refuse pehle hi..but I am always up for plans when they invite. I understand it can happen but 5 years, noone ever said yes to my plan.

I even tried going for outdoors with them...planned hikes a couple of times but people only turned up twice. Then they started refusing. 

If one person says no, all say no...feels like they are cancelling me together. I even asked the girls to meet for coffee, hikes, walk...always no we are busy..next week milte hain n no initiative later

But we play poker. And twice a month they do invite us for poker but it's upto them when they feel like.. we have no say.

What am I doing wrong that I am so much a failure in making friends?",2,1763290729.0,AskIndianWomen,9,1.0,False

Let me be clear, in France a pain au chocolat or a croissant costs between 0.80 euros and 1.20 euros at the most expensive.

Istanbul airport is selling pastries for between 8 and 10 euros! WHAT?!
The same goes for brownies, cookies, donuts, even just any old cake.

They range from 8 to 14 euros. How is that even possible?

Let's not even mention the €8 coffees, €12 milkshakes, and €9 fruit juices.

And we only had a small snack there.

If you want a proper meal, it'll cost you at least €20 for a measly omelet.

Want to take a nap because your layover is long ? No problem, we have sleeping capsules for 20 euros an hour. AN HOUR !

Bro i can’t… This is insane.
And they are smarts asf, they know it's an extremely busy international transit airport.

Anyway, I'm writing all this after having my americano coffee and my banana milkshake, which, oddly enough, tastes like strawberry, for 22 euros.

At the same time, the waiter brought me my banana milkshake with a strawberry on top of the whipped cream and a pinkish texture. I should have known better...

1oyiuy1,https://i.redd.it/i801ifmbll1g1.jpeg,"Help, I've fallen and I can't get up!","One month ago, I was pooh-poohing the idea of getting a Lamy. I'd picked up an LX Rose Gold one that my wife received as a birthday gift from a friend, and was not impressed with how poorly it wrote and how quickly the nib would dry after just a day of sitting around.

Then I picked up a bottle of Lamy Petrol 2017 ink, and loved it. So on my next visit to Kinokuniya in Abu Dhabi, I picked up a Lamy Al-Star Petrol <EF> that they had in stock. Turned out to be a totally different experience - the feedback from the nib was excellent, and I enjoyed the balance. And it works perfectly with any of my inks, including the troublesome ones like Kaweco Smokey Grey and Herbin's PdL. Of course, I had to ink it with Petrol, because.

Within a month, I picked up a Lamy Bronze Al-Star, having managed to get my hands on a bottle of Lamy Bronze. Obviously, seeing that I love my Lamy Violet Blackberry, Pink Cliff, Dark Lilac, and Vibrant Pink, you can sort of see where this is going. 

I managed to get an Al-Star Vibrant Pink but the feed was damaged and had to be sent back, so I got annoyed and picked up an LX Marron, which got inked with Mita Club's Coffee ink (and yes, it smells like coffee). Then Toumaline and Graphite followed shortly after, inked with Kaweco Smokey Grey and Iroshizuku Ku-Jaku. And I stumbled on a pretty good deal on Amazon for an Ocean Blue, and inked it with Iroshizuku Ajisai.

Last Thursday, my wife and I decided to visit 1 of 2 pen shops in Dubai, and she found a Lamy Safari Terra Red. And they had Safari Pink Cliff in stock, and Pink Cliff is one of my favourite blue-black inks. No prizes for guessing what I inked the Safari Pink Cliff with.

Last night, my wife decided she didn't quite like how thick the lines were from the Terra Red (she uses Platinum EF and UEF), and passed the Terra Red to me, which got quickly inked with Platinum's Sepia Pigment ink, which has now become my favorite brown-orange ink.

I'm sitting here at work now and eyeing Lamy's Fiery Red and Aquatic Blue to ink with Vibrant Pink and Edelstein Golden Lapis respectively. Both are in my cart, along with Safari Violet Blackberry and Vibrant Pink. 

Admittedly, Lamy's are terrible value for money compared with Pilot Kakunos, but there's a certain balance and feedback that I really like, and I can practically find any color to match the 30 or so inks in my collection makes them a new addiction. 

Surely I can't be the only one obsessing over Lamy Safaris and Al-Stars and trying to match them to inks?",9,1763290558.0,fountainpens,3,0.92,False

1oyitna,https://i.redd.it/zgbbmnbokl1g1.jpeg,"TOP100 Pocket Detective on Duty - Who is selling, Who is holding - lets find out together","Hey all, Sunday update time

Quite the week for Crypto - ETH/BTC huge volatility towards the 4 year cycle - hopefully this if main cryptos go down, people will shift more to 401jk (hehe)

Updated spreadsheet of TOP100 holders can be found [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lqwC0Pc4ORygByWe-G2N9aipWQVYi9FHfavf8J-i5o4/edit?usp=sharing)

Looking at the data we have a clear picture for the entire week:

* Top 10 holding strong
* Yesterday we had few strong sellers (note they already sold in the past, shows they are taking profits bit by bit):
   * Top 40 sold 887k tokens (13.27% of his portfolio)
   * Top 41 sold 3.1m tokens (35.97% of his portfolio)
* In total from Top 100 3 total wallets not only holded, but added additional buys:
   * Top 73 bought additional 11.9k tokens
   * Top 82 bought additional 12.3k tokens
   * Top 92 bought additional 83k tokens
* Note for future - we see and we will continue to see huge drops when Pump.fun AMM (401jk-WSOL) Market continues to add liquidity while we grow - if you see a huge 5%+- spike down - try to look if its that before panicking - will save you a lot of nerves as main a biggest seller during the entire week was AMM adding liquidity to our pool, good sign for the holding itself.

Additionally I wanted to address some of communities notice about botting in 401jk:

There was a study that shows **93 of the top 100 wallets** on Pump.fun trade more than **18 hours per day** source [HERE](https://cryptorank.io/news/feed/340e4-active-wallets-on-pump-fun-automate-trades) (not the kind of study I personally like to rely on, but has good data collection and points raised).

For 401jk top 100 no one is botting - just wanted to address this concern. Strategy behind these bots usually revolve around exploiting tiny price differences by flipping back and forth.

These strategies typically yield small gains per trade but scale up through thousands of transactions. They can provide liquidity, but they also create volatility and can frontrun human traders - meaning if you are casual 401 retiree like majority of our community - don't concern yourself with it, unless  you try to snipe ups and downs, then gl brother I pray Valhalla gods will grant you luck against the bots - better strategy, just buy and hold)

All of what I said is just my opinion, look at the data yourself and make your own research, do your own conclusions.

Like most people, I've spent so much time and energy trying to figure it out in the hopes of discovering peace, joy, contentment. 

Some days are OK. I'm 40 and have not been able to fall for anyone (who was also interested in me). Its pointless trying so I dont. Nothing has ever helped as far as I'm aware. 

I'm lucky in many respects. I seem not to need people in my life... so I introspect. However,  I'm ready to go. I'm ready to dissappear... to never wake again lol 

This is my truth. I see no point to this life. I've pursued and am currently pursuing pleasure. I have a healthy, skinny athletic body which functions mostly well (as far as I can tell).

Many might dream of having my life but they dont know what its like every day having to work diligently to keep happy. It's like breathing where every exhale is suffering so I have to breath again. Pointless. 

No job, home, romantic partner, real friendship. I've never been able to enjoy people's company properly. I just dont have the ability to feel a nice connection with anyone.

I'm so desperate for a connection that any time a woman shows interest, I scare her away.

Why I bother trying is beyond me. I've had suicidal ideation for many years but it has slowed right down since making a bunch of money and going on an extensive journey around Africa and now Asia. I move daily and sometimes every third day... for one year so far.

I'm not like some people who just love others. I'm considerate and try to help people. I'm sad at all the desperate suffering people around the world. 

I used to be a devout Christian but after years of dedicated study and commitment to meeting God, I abandoned it (thankfully). 

I thought enlightenment was the answer and would help me but to no avail. It's an experience reserved only for the very few lucky ones. (Don't believe people who say they got enlightenment from psychedelics... it's not the real enlightenment, a simulation perhaps). 

I'm grateful for all the amazing music and coffee that gives me a great start to the day every morning. So, its not all awful, its just that the good times dont make the suffering worthwhile. 

It seems to me like most people are suffering. Some people say they love living and are afraid to die... 

Anyway, if God is reading this, I hope there is either nothing (like in deep sleep) or something better than this life (and take me tonight). Fingers crossed that I dont wake up tomorrow. One day this dream will come true but sooner is better than later. ",0,1763289804.0,offmychest,1,0.5,False

My travel route was Beijing – Luoyang – Dengfeng – Kaifeng – Chongqing – Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan – Furong – Fenghuang – Wangxiangu – Hengdian Film Studios – Shanghai – HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I’ve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I’ve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**HENGDIAN WORLD STUDIOS = 3 nights** and I will return again and again!

**I caught a 3hr K-train from Shangrao train station to Yiwu train station for $12 AUD booked on Trip.com including the booking fee, for a hard seat** (it was cushioned so not a hard plastic type seat). I was in a carriage jam-packed with people (see photo 4 attached), many standing and there was nowhere to put my 28” suitcase – I had to put it in front of my seat and sit sideways with my legs in the aisle: so lucky I was allocated an aisle seat! It was definitely an experience that I won’t forget. I felt like I was back in old China, not modern China with this train! There was no air-con and all the windows were open. **This train also ran 15min late! SHOCK! Note: Look at the digital boards at the train station (see photo 2 attached): if your train is running late, the time it will arrive will be in red – in the far right column. As my train was behind schedule, I missed the connecting 15min train to get to Hengdian (lucky I didn’t pre-book the connecting train!).** I didn’t want to wait another hour for the next connecting one so I caught a taxi, not a DiDi, to my hotel from Yiwu train station. **As noted by other redditors, it costs around 150 yuan and 1hr via taxi from Yiwu train station to the Hengdian area. It’s definitely cheaper to use DiDi, but the DiDi waiting area was really crowded when I arrived, it was hot, I was tired and I wanted to get to my hotel ASAP and go out exploring ASAP.**

**I stayed for 3 nights at Pai Hotel (Hengdian Wansheng South Street Branch) = $62 AUD booked via Trip.com.** My room was huge (see photo 6 and 7 attached): it had a queen bed, TV, bathroom with stand in shower, sit-down western toilet, leatherette lounge chair and foot stool, big window that opened to the street and, of course, working air-con. Breakfast was not provided or included which was fine as there’s plenty of places to eat on the street and around the corner. **Its a very popular hotel = see Trip.com reviews**; located right opposite Starbucks and tucked away around the corner from the main street. **Its about 20 metres from a taxi stand and Huating Haowang Night Market** which is 70% street food and some clothing stores, shoes, bags and accessories, toys etc as you walk further into the street and head towards the local residential area. I highly recommend staying here if you don’t need anything fancy, just a place to sleep and shower – especially if you’ll be out and about all day / night.

**If you want to know which area to stay in Hengdian, then I recommend staying near the Huating Haowang Night Market area (see photo12, 13, 14, 15 attached) so you have access to more food choices. There’s also McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks, Luckin Coffee, Mixue, a pedestrian shopping street, fruit & vegetable stores etc all within 5min walking distance. From the Huating Haowang Night Market to the most popular Hengdian attractions, it should cost around 15 yuan for a taxi, not a DiDi, one way. There is a taxi stand about 20 metres from the Huating Haowang Night Market.** I typed into my Google Translator: can you take me to the night market please? and the taxi driver understood. Of course, you can order a DiDi via Alipay too...

**Hengdian World Studios isn’t an internationally popular or well-known place to visit unless you watch a lot of Chinese TV shows aka Cdramas.** FYI: It is one of the biggest film studios in the world, with over 30 shooting bases and more than 100 studios showcasing various historical periods, locations, landmarks etc. Its located in a city called Dongyang in Zhejang province. **If you’re coming from Shanghai, you can catch a train directly to Hengdian train station and it should take around 20min by taxi, or DiDi, to the Huating Haowang Night Market area.**

**I bought the Hengdian World Studios 3-day pass with x5 attraction entry tickets for $107 AUD on Trip.com. This meant it cost $21.40 AUD per attraction = so cheap, really incredible value for money!** You can pay to just visit one attraction for around $40 AUD each or $70 AUD to visit two attractions in one day, but its much better to book a 3-day pass. With this 3-day pass, you choose x5 attractions out of x12 (some have several different names or similar names and its annoyingly confusing) to visit and they include:

* Dream Valley = I visited
* Qin Palace or Palace of Emperor Qin = I visited
* Along the River during Qingming Festival or QingMing = I visited
* Ming & Qing Palaces or Palace of Ming & Qing Dynasties = I visited
* Guangzhou Street & Hong Kong Street or Old Guangzhou & Hong Kong Street = I visited
* Dream Spring Valley including bathing fee
* Pingyan Cave
* Chinese Cultural Park
* National Defence Science & Technology Education Park
* Yuanmingyuan Spring Garden
* Yuanmingyuan Summer Garden

**To enter each attraction, you just scan your passport at the ticket gate – like at the high-speed long-distance train stations.** Its very easy! You do not need to show your Trip.com booking / receipt, or scan a QR code, or collect a paper ticket, etc. **Near the ticket gate area, or once you’re inside each attraction, look for a noticeboard (or poster sign) with the WeChat QR code. Scan it so you can access and download a map, the day’s show schedule and you will also join a group chat for that attraction (everyone else who’s visiting the attraction will also have access to the same information). This is incredibly useful as you can type in the group chat (in English) if you need help with directions (on how to get from A to B) and they will respond with a pinpoint map (open via Amap) so you can navigate your way around the attraction. The staff also text in the group chat, whats a must see / recommendation and remind you to get there about 10min before the show starts so you can find a seat!**

**For all those Cdrama fans who want to buy specific merchandise at Hengdian World Studios, there’s not much choice or variety. Ugh. The souvenirs and shops in Hengdian were really disappointing. The only items that I bought were x2 Cdrama: The Untamed canvas tote bags for 30 yuan each, I got a Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji design (see photo 20 attached).** Depending on what you’re after, its better to buy online. You will see some keyrings, postcards, stationery – the usual stuff but nothing really unique or interesting. I’m guessing it depends on what’s the most popular or highly acclaimed TV drama at the time or what’s left over - old stock (I think those canvas bags that I bought are left over stock haha), is what you will find at these attractions.

**If you want to save your legs, feet and energy, you can rent golf carts at some of the attractions**. I didn’t as I was solo travelling and its quite expensive for x1 person. I also preferred to walk so I can stop and take photos whenever I wanted. If you do rent a golf cart, you drive it like a car and have to park in a designated area at each building or area you visit within the attraction. I saw some people get stuck – their golf cart wouldn’t start and had to find staff for assistance... Nevertheless, **its a great option if you have the money to splurge, if you have luggage like hanfu (traditional outfits) to carry around for your photo-shoots, if you’re travelling with kids and the elderly, plus it will help you save time with exploring the attraction (less walking) as they are all huge!**

**In the Hengdian attractions, there’s plenty of toilets, all clean and with toilet paper provided. If I remember correctly, there was a mixture of sit-down western toilets and the squat type available at each attraction. You pay for everything = food, drinks and souvenirs via WeChat / Wexin pay or Alipay. I didn’t use cash anywhere. I don’t remember seeing any ATMs in the attractions and maybe I saw a few powerbank rental spots – but its best to bring your own if you can so you don’t have to go looking for one...**


1: **DREAM VALLEY**

**My first attraction visit was Dream Valley theme park.** It was a 30min walk from my hotel (I used Amap to navigate here) and I arrived here before 4pm and left around 8.30pm. This theme park was really empty, no crowds or queues as school holidays was over – I would say there was less than 100 people here. The ‘waterworld’ section: **water-slides and pools**, was closed and that would probably be the main draw here during the summer as it was a huge area. I ventured to the **aquarium** first and watched the **20min seal show**, then watched some people **feed the animals** (you have to pay extra). The jellyfish section was cool and you can see nemo, turtles, sharks etc. I went on some rides like **the classic carousel / merry-go-round**, a ride where **I was spun around and upside down** (don’t eat before you go on such rides!)… I visited a **Ghost House** which was surprisingly scary good especially when you’re the only one in there HAHA I had to turn on my mobile flashlight to see where I was walking cause it was so dark inside… I watched x2 **dancing and stunt type shows on an outdoor stage**… I had dinner here too.

With Dream Valley, there’s enough to keep you busy and entertained all day / night especially if you’re here with kids. I wandered through the kids area and there was **lots of colourful copied figures and statues of characters such as Totoro, Mario, Doreamon, etc.**... I played with **the big keyboard / piano (like in Big movie with Tom Hanks)**; went on a slow, scenic ride ‘in the sky’ (takes you to the indoor and outdoor area)... there’s a huge **Ferris Wheel** (that you can see from other attractions in Hengdian)… **dodgem cars**, **a mini grand prix racing car track**, and more but I didn’t have the time to see everything or experience it all. **Now, did I have a good time and would I return? Yes, well, I didn’t hate it or love it. Its not a must visit as its quite an ordinary theme park – compared to other theme parks around the world, its probably boring and not worth visiting... but it was a really pleasant experience. For $21 AUD entry fee, there’s nothing to complain about and I wasn’t expecting a Disneyland or Universal Studios type experience! Consider this your ‘Made in China’ type theme park experience! Also, I think it would have been more enjoyable if I was here with friends… I was here solo.**


2: **PALACE OF EMPEROR QIN**

**The next day, I visited Palace of Emperor Qin.** I was here for about 4hrs: 10am to 2pm and I really enjoyed my visit. When you walk through this attraction, you will feel like you’ve been here before! Its a very familiar, strange and eerie place... **This place is most famous for the high-walled walkway (official name is Auxiliary Passage) and that you see in many Cdramas: usually where there’s an invasion, a battle, an attack, an assassination, or the lead characters are just walking through...** I missed out on the **opening ceremony** (I wanted to attend but needed the sleep in!) so if you want to experience everything, arrive early! I recommend watching the **30min Sword-fighting show** which is indoors and where the audience members can participate: **you volunteer to go on stage and learn some martial arts** (it was fun and funny watching). Most people just watch this show and **wander around the main areas taking photos** then leave, but there’s actually quite a lot to see and do for 4hrs+.

There’s several **10min street-skit type performances throughout the place and you can participate**: I watched a few and even though I don’t speak Chinese (can understand a little bit from watching so many Cdramas), and enjoyed them as they’re easy to follow... **All the staff are dressed up in hanfu (traditional outfits) and you can also play games with them (at allocated times which are posted at the location).** When you explore Palace of Emperor Qin, make sure to look up and above your head to see about **x25 different Cdramas advertised here on the roof walkways.** I’m assuming they were all filmed at Palace of Emperor Qin (or somewhere in Hengdian World Studios). If you look at the map, on the far left side, you will also see there’s a whole section that’s greyed out and called **Non-Tourist Area = this is for live filming, cast and crew access only.** I didn’t see any celebrities or live Cdrama filming at Palace of Emperor Qin but there were plenty of visitors dressed in hanfu taking professional photo-shoots here!

There are also two rides = yes, actual rides, in Palace of Emperor Qin attraction! I was not expecting this. They were both great experiences and not to be missed! **One ride is called The Qin Empire** (located in a building behind the Emperor’s Throne) **and it was like Harry Potter’s Forbidden Journey, where you sit in a chair and you’re lifted off the ground to follow a big digital screen which takes you around Ancient China. The second ride is called Advent of Dragon Emperor** (located in a building on the far left side and next to an outdoor food and resting area called Xunqinji Food Street) **and it was like visiting the Chinese version of Jurassic Park, where you sit in an 8-seater car and wear 3-D glasses then venture on a journey fighting dragons – instead of dinosaurs!** As I visited after school holidays and on a weekday, I waited around 10mins for each ride. I haven’t read anything about these two rides online so they were a wonderful surprise! Of course, you don’t come all the way here for such rides, but while you’re here, definitely experience them – why not?!

Another area that’s worth exploring at Palace of Emperor Qin is the **Time Tunnel** and **Que Tower** with **the army training camp** in between (not mentioned on the map but its there!). This area is also used in many Cdramas to film the soldiers working out, preparing for battle or to play traditional sports. **According to the map, there are x18 places to visit at Palace of the Emperor Qin attraction** but a few areas were closed or blocked off and one was being renovated when I was here. As you head towards the exit, make sure you stop to look at **big posters of various Cdramas** filmed here and at **the celebrity hand-prints** – you can touch and put your hands in theirs (like Hollywood Walk of Fame stuff). **Now, if you have limited time here – if you cannot visit Hengdian World Studios for 3 days, definitely visit Palace of Emperor Qin. Yes, I loved my visit and would return again and again. Next time, I would also rent hanfu and take photos around here too!**


3: **ALONG THE RIVER QINGMING FESTIVAL**

I had lunch outside of Palace of Emperor Qin (there’s like x4 restaurants and x2 shops), then walked 15min to visit **Along the River QingMing Festival.** Its basically next door (or behind) to Palace of Emperor Qin but due to its size, you have to walk a long way around to one of the entrances (there are two entrances and I went in via a smaller ticket gate, not the main entrance). I visited QingMing from about 3pm to 8pm and wished I had more time here. There’s a lot more to see and do in QingMing compared to Palace of Emperor Qin. Maybe, due to the heat and humidity (it was 38 degrees and super sunny), and because I already visited **Millennium City Park theme park and Wanshuishanwuxiacheng / Wansui Mountain Martial Arts City theme park in Kaifeng, Henan province** - a few weeks earlier, my experience here was okay... **I had high hopes for this place and after being amazed with my visit to Palace of Emperor Qin, I felt a bit disappointed about QingMing.** Don’t get me wrong, I still recommend to visit QingMing as you will recognise at least one of its main landmarks in many Cdramas!

**According to the map, there are x18 ‘Scenic Spots’ to visit, x4 shows to watch and x4 ‘Experiences’ for visitors.** I didn’t have the time for everything… When I arrived here and figured my way around, I missed out on watching **Dream of Bianjing show** and it wasn’t scheduled again that day. Ugh. I ended up watching a few other **indoor shows** and several **outdoor street-skit type performances** which were great. The two main areas that you must visit in QingMing is **Fanlou** = this huge building with an outdoor stage area and high archway bridge with a pond (its featured in many Cdramas such as the more recent Legend of Zang Hai for the FL’s restaurant, and its also often used as a base then digitally changed to look bigger / taller than it is in real life) and **Xuonglong Realm** (which is Xianxia themed – think gods, the heavens, fantasy genre such as Cdrama: Ancient Love Poetry or Immortal Samsara). **If you come to QingMing and don’t wander around these two areas then its really not worth visiting QingMing!**

What I noticed while wandering around QingMing, is that the day time staff aren’t as friendly as the night time staff – perhaps, they all seemed a bit miserable because of the heat / humidity? There was one male staff dressed in a female outfit that performed at night and he was very funny – saved the day really! **I would describe visiting QingMing is like visiting an ancient town: there’s a main street, market area, food stalls and restaurants, some shops, a temple, gardens, ponds, pavilions, city wall, city tower, city gate, ‘important person’s’ mansion** (like in Cdramas, you’re visiting someone’s house and you can take photos in the bedroom, study area, garden etc), **tea-making area, fortune-telling house, ceramic museum plusa ghost house experience, indoor theatre, outdoor stage areas, etc. You could live here – its just missing a hotel!**

**There are x10 areas in QingMing that are used for filming: x4 areas that are not accessible to visitors / the public and x6 areas that are available to everyone.** Unfortunately, I didn’t see any celebrities or live filming while I was here… Make sure to check the day’s show schedule via WeChat (like at Palace of Emperor Qin) and whether you can join in on the **‘I’m an Extra at Hengdian’ experience.** At night, there’s an **Iron Fireworks show** (like Dashuhua or Da Tie Hua which loosely translates to Iron Fire Flower – as I watched in Chongqing, I didn’t watch this one) and the whole place is lit up beautifully with all the lights, lanterns, etc. Its very pretty, colourful and festive! There was less than 100 people visiting during the day and probably more than 400 people visiting at night? It wasn’t crowded at all – there were no queues or lines anywhere. The only time that I saw lots of people was at the shows and performances. **Yes, I would still like to return to QingMing and I will plan my visit better – most likely for an all day / night venture, rent hanfu, watch all the shows and participate in all the experiences. I would also visit when its cooler, but not when its raining!**


4: **PALACE OF MING & QING DYNASTIES**

On my last day, I visit **Palace of Ming and Qing Dynasties** from around 10am to 4pm. This attraction is basically a replica of **The Forbidden City and many Cdramas are filmed here.** This place is so big and incredible! I didn’t think I would enjoy it so much or spend so much time here. I’ve already been to real The Forbidden City, twice, so visiting this place was quite a novel experience! There’s a lot more to see and do here than you would expect. I haven’t seen or read much about this place online so I was really surprised and very happy with my time here. **According to the map, there’s x22 areas to visit including x8 that’s considered as a ‘Film & TV Experience Zone’ and x14 that’s considered as a ‘Crew Shooting Area’ but all appear open and available to everyone… the key is be quiet when you see live filming! Yes, I watched some live Cdrama filming here and I was standing next to one of the cameramen!!!**

I missed out on **meeting and greeting the Emperor at 8:30am opening time** (will have to return to say hi to him) but I watched all the other shows: **11am 30min Cavalry of Eight Banners horse-riding action stunt show** (great, recommend); **12pm 10min skit performance where the Emperor selects a Concubine** (visitors participated and they all said they were 20 years old haha); **1pm 30min How the Green Screen is used in the entertainment industry** (where visitors can participate on stage and it was excellent, very entertaining and interesting); **2pm 30min Zijin Ceremony indoor stage show** (bit of romance, martial arts, lots of colourful lights and digital screens used). Each show is different and enjoyable. I don’t regret watching any of them and would happily watch them all again.

I also went to the **Weapons Exhibition Hall** which houses many cool swords from classic Cdramas such as Heavenly Dragon Sword and Sabre by Jin Yong, **Imperial Garden** which showcased a good variety of buildings, flowers and a fish pond – many great photo-ops here and there was staff dressed in hanfu to play traditional games with or take photos with, a **Nine-Dragon Screen** wall, and **Qing Palace Imperial Cuisine Museum** - which I highly recommend visiting. At this museum, you can see samples of different dishes cooked for the royal family and their guests throughout various dynasties, the china, tea-ware and cutlery used etc. I thought it was really beautiful, fascinating, well-presented and reminded me of Cdrama: Royal Feast. I don’t think many people visit the museums in Hengdian and that’s a shame. I think most people just wander around to take photos and look for live filming?

While I was at Palace of Ming & Qing Dynasties, **I saw x5 different live filming areas!** I managed to snap a few photos at each location but two – as they were setting up to get ready for a shoot or they were dismantling the equipment to move to another area (bit boring to snap a photo of!) Regardless, you can definitely watch live Cdrama filming here! **The one live Cdrama filming area that I stayed around for the longest (see photo 19 attached), isn’t even marked on the map – its just a few buildings on the map!** There were about a dozen crew members including x3 cameramen, the cast and extras, the production team and maybe x20 visitors like me hanging around watching in silence. **The scene I watched being filmed was a princess (I assume) and her competitors preparing a fish meal for the consort and her guests. One of her guests take a bite and collapses. The princess is accused of trying to poison the consort…** While I stood next to the cameraman and watched, I noticed you could hardly hear the cast speak. It was in a building with open doors and windows so you could watch by peering from behind the pillars, curtains etc. **It was funny when the fish moved on the plate on the table and a few of the female cast members screamed! A production team member then ran in, grabbed the fish and smacked it on its head. From this experience, I can tell you, yes real food – live fish, is used to film cooking scenes!** If anyone knows what I had watched getting filmed, please do tell me! But I suspect is a low budget Cdrama and probably only available to watch in China...

Afterwards, I made my way through the other filming areas and many buildings were empty but you could see how and where Cdramas are made here – there was furniture and props used stored away in the halls, the camera and lighting equipment left out in the walkways (crew was nearby), etc. Many areas seemed rundown, old, even ‘abandoned’ and so I presume they would be digitally touched up or made taller / bigger / nicer than they are in real life. **Now, if you have limited time here – if you cannot visit Hengdian World Studios for 3 days, definitely visit Palace of Emperor Qin along with Palace of Ming & Qing Dynasties, in 1 day. Yes, I loved my visit here a lot and would return again and again. Next time, I would also rent hanfu and take photos around here too! Think Cdrama: Story of Yanxi Palace...**


5: **OLD GUANGZHOU & HONG KONG STREET**

From Palace of Ming & Qing Dynasties, its about a 15min walk to **Old Guangzhou & Hong Kong Street**. You will walk through a long carpark and see a huge **‘I’m in Hengdian’ sign on a building** (see first photo attached) and the ‘staff only’ entrance to Palace of Ming & Qing Dynasties in the far right side. Then, you will cross a street and walk through another car park before you reach a ticket gate entrance (I think its the South Gate? There’s also a North Gate entrance). I was here from about 4:30pm to 9pm and didn’t have enough time to explore all the areas = I only visited half the place, mainly where the shows and performances were held. I read from online reviews, that Old Guangzhou & Hong Kong Street is **best to visit in the afternoon and at night as there are more shows and performances on.** Once you’ve visited the other Hengdian attractions, like me, coming to this one was refreshing as its more of a modern or western style cinematic live experience – its different compared to visiting the attractions based on Ancient China or with the Xianxia genre.

Most of the places of interest here is located on the left side of the lake. I watched the **5pm 30min Story of Huang Fei Hong outdoor stage show and its a must!** The show starts off as a traditional wedding – where the bride and groom arrives, then they’re interrupted by this gang who tries to kidnap the bride. Huang Fei Hong (he’s famous character / person in martial arts history and many movies have been made about him) appears and tries to stop the gang.... There’s live Kungfu action and with (fake) guns, some bombs / explosions, lots of chasing through the buildings, flying on wire to buildings, classic comedy scenes like when the bad guy gets blown up while going to the toilet…. Nothing very original but it was entertaining and I needed to sit down for a bit!

**According to the map, there are x12 ‘Main Sightseeing Areas’ for visitors and x11 ‘Crew Shooting Areas’ which visitors cannot wander into?** Aww... **I didn’t see any live Cdrama filming here but I got to be an extra in a 2hr live action experience – along with 200 other people!** From about 6pm to 8pm, you follow a man with a megaphone around the streets and watch him select a few volunteers from the crowd to be the supporting cast (you get to wear costumes and say a few lines), join a marching protest, a shoot-out (with fake rifles and hand guns), a gang fight (with fake knives and butchers knives), a guy proposing to a girl with flying banners and confetti, and more. While I watched and snapped photos during these 2hrs, I also ducked away for 10min into the **China Film Projector Museum** which showcased many different film projectors used throughout history and around the world, interesting facts and stories about movies, celebrities, the cast and crew in the entertainment industry etc. I highly recommend walking through this museum. **At 7pm, the cast and crew took a break and everyone – including me, went to this Pier / Waterfront area at the back of the attraction to watch a 15min live water stunt show:** men with jet-packs zipping around in the air and jet-skiers doing somersaults on the water kind of thing. It was quite boring (I’ve seen this kind of stuff many times), not a must watch, but there wasn’t anything to do here at this time...

To end the night, the guy with the megaphone will lead you to the **Queens Palace Hotel** where there’s a **20min live song and dance type show with the performers dressed in outfits from different periods and 8:30pm 5min fireworks.** What a wonderful way to end my time at Hengdian World Studios! I didn’t know about the fireworks! As you slowly make your way out of Old Guangzhou & HK Street, you will see many street performers posing and you can take photos with them. There’s a **Bruce Lee statue** somewhere along the way, a **Bread Museum** which I didn’t have time to visit (bugger), a huge **teahouse, mansions, towers, gardens and churches** that I also need to check out on my next visit here. **So, did I enjoy my visit here? Yes! Would I revisit? Yes!**

**FINAL THOUGHTS:** I think, when you visit a place like **Hengdian World Studios**, don’t expect or assume anything – have an open mind. **Hengdian World Studios is like the Asian version of Hollywood. You don’t visit Hengdian for Chinese culture, history or food. You visit to be entertained and to be transported to a different dynasty, era or period with live action, music, song and dance etc.** Its one of the few places in the world that welcomes tourists, foreigners, visitors – even locals, to experience what its like being an extra in a movie or TV show without having to go through an audition, or have an agent... **Hengdian World Studios is a must visit if you’ve always wanted to see how movies and TV shows are created, behind the scenes, in person (not watch a documentary). Its also a great place to take those hanfu photo-shoots and to see where Cdramas are actually filmed, live – if you’re lucky!**

Background:
I (23M) am In a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for 3.5 years. 
4months into our relationship my gf warned me about a mutual friend from college, that she didn’t have the right intentions with me. I didn’t believe her, long story short after around a year of me fighting with my girl for that girl I discovered that yes that girl did want to get in my pants. To her I emotionally cheated. I agree to that statement somewhat. 

We had ups and downs. The next problem came up when my mutual friend group was still friends with that girl. I couldn’t, didn’t want to lose my friend group with similar mindsets and intentions. We fought again. And although I did cut them all off from my life and moved on it wasn’t without fights with my girlfriend over having them. She had issues with me being friends with girls, I shouldn’t be an easy guy. I should not be the one to have an open shoulder for girls to rely on in any case she said. I agreed. 

Next we fought on my relationship with my family. To her I am a mumma’s boy. There are a lot of personal family issues which I cant get into but I mostly try not to involve her in my family matters. My cousins sisters who I am quite close with was not really liked by my girl since they didn’t respond properly to her advances of friendship through social media. We fought to the point of breakup. Because im not in a phase of life to have to choose between my partner and my family. And I will always love to have my family beside me. She came back and apologised for not understanding family dynamics. She told me it was her fault. We fixed. 

Cut to June 2024, I got the opportunity to move out of town for a much better program for my masters. It is in one of the best institutes for my subject. But that meant moving away 1200kms. We fought again. She told me that she wouldn’t be able to do LDR. She will be having trust issues with me. I told her I will help her be informed about my life there. We fought yes but she let me come to do my masters. Two things happened, one I got a complete makeover with the set of friends I had, and the bad thing I started doing was avoiding or not revealing many things I did like hang out with folks over tea or coffee. Have conversations about life etc. make new friends irrespective of gender.  

September 2024, our class had planned a day trip to a nearby waterfall and forested area. I love the outdoors and she knows this. I informed her and we fought. She didn’t want me to go. There will be girls ill be involved with them. In the process it came up all I had been hanging with folks from class and enjoying my life. She was devastated that I went back to my “old ways” of being a easy-going person. We took space. She let me go to the trip and I facetimed her and we talked about the trip how I wasn’t really hanging with ladies and were with guys. She was happy that I was happy. 

But things didn’t go well, I talked to her she told me yet again avoid a few people from class one being the closest friend I have here., who is a guy btw. I avoided girls but felt like she was pushy with her. She wanted me to block most of the girls from class anyone who had pushed my boundaries a bit. I accept my fault that the boundaries that I put my I don’t do enough maybe to enforce them. We fought and fought. I explained her that I aint doing anything wrong and I don’t think people have the capability to hurt us anymore I wont let that happen but she was adamant. Well, it turned out that yet again her intuitions about few of the girls were right. They didn’t have the best intensions towards me. But in my opinion I had done enough already to block their advances or whatever. In any case she told me and I blocked many of the girls from my class in order to prevent be mistakenly breaking boundaries again.

My faults: I had asked her for some academic help and shared it with almost a complete stranger girl who had the same academic interests as me. This I did without telling her. I took a picture of another girl she had told me to be careful about. I helped another girl get a doctor’s appointment. All of this she found out going through my phone when I recently went to my hometown. We had a big fallout.

current issue: we in class got info about a short film competition being organised and my homie and our mates all wanted to do it. I politely declined the offer to join their team since I knew surely that their will be women involved in the film ill have to interact with them and something weird might happen. For three four days my 2 male friends tried to convince me to join but I was adamant. I would like to mention even though I didn’t join for my relationship’s sake, me personally wanted to join. Cut to a week later, I get a call from my friend to come join them at someone’s flat to look at the final product that they made as a critic and help them better the film with final touches. Like a pre screening to fix shit. After some deliberation I decided myself to go. What I didn’t know was that at the same time my girl was having one of the worst days of her life. She had a very traumatic event and genuinely needed me. While we were talking on text, she only alluded to that something was kind of wrong I asked her what and the convo fizzled out. I didn’t push and didn’t inform her that I would be going to the screening and helping them with the film. Long story short that night when I texted her she didn’t reply. Next morning she opened with where I was last night and I told her the truth. I was feeling really guilty about the whole not telling her. She informed me that she saw on someone’s socials that I was there and was devastated that how I could do this to her. She needed me the most and I was out there having fun doing what I love while she was getting devastated by life. She was astounded that how this so-called male friend of mine can just persuade me to do anything that I myself would never do. How I couldn’t say no to him. How filthy I am for doing that to her and how unworthy she is of getting the bare minimum from me. While I am completely at fault here, I know, I just asked her if she could have just called me asking me that she needed me right that moment. To this she replied that even if she did I would have probably told her to wait and have fun with my friends first, which is completely false.

I'm at an wits end on what I should do? She has completely victimized herself idk what I could even call that. She is adamant that something must be wrong with her that everyone always chooses anyone except her including me. She is alone and it is her fault. I want her to get out of that mindset but I don't know if I want to be with her? I don't know what to do?

1oyifvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1oyifvt/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_be_associated_with_my/,AITAH for not wanting to be associated with my boyfriend because of his name?,"For the background: I am a 22F am a law student at a top university (3rd year) and get good grades as well. I live in a country in Europe (Born and raised here). My parents are immigrants. My boyfriend 28M (Mike) is a singer from the country where my parents are from. I met him 2 years ago and started dating 2 months ago. I love the music industry and it's also a side of me that very few people know, as I like to keep my law life apart from the party one.

Through the years I got closer with management from a lot of artists. So usually I get invited and go backstage have a chat with everyone etc etc. That is how I met Mike and the dating started when I was backstage and we were just chatting with everyone. I apparently dropped my uni ID there. Mike brought it to me the next day before his flight (which was really nice of him). He came with flowers and my ID. We had a friendly coffee which turned into a date and now we're 2 months further.

I have told my aunt about it not my parents. She is supportive, but also shared her concerns regarding my future. She said ""this guy is famous in his home country, you will be known as his girlfriend, not as a successful student or lawyer in the future. And your parents won't approve this, you should be dating people from your standart at all times also regarding studies not someone who is out performing at night clubs"". She is right and I know that we really are from 2 different worlds. He is out at a club I am studying in my office till the morning. My parents have always been really sensitive about education, as they weren't fortunate enough to go to uni. So they are waiting for me to become successful, not in the fame world, but in the legal world and obviously they want me to date/marry someone who shares the same educational values.

Now the issue is Mike wants to meet my parents. In our culture that means being serious etc. I told him it's too early. He said we've known each other for years and he doesn't think it's early. I didn't tell him all of my concerns but a day later he said ""if I would've been a brain surgeon or a med student you would've thought very differently right. Is it because you are ashamed of me and my job"". I told him I am not ashamed but meeting parents means having serious expectations for parents. I said that we should take it slow and that I don't want anyone to know yet. I also don't want to be published in the media as the girlfriend of. I want my own name which I can achieve with my studies. He said that I should let him help me. I told him no, because in a few years when I'm a lawyer I don't want to be a lawyer who made it because of Mike and his money. I don't need all of that I can do it on my own and my parents. I don't want to use his name. He accused me of being ashamed of him and said that he feels like I don't want to be associated with him because he isn't a neurosurgeon or something.

1oyif8j,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1oyif8j/chat_gpt_vs_years_of_acne/,Chat GPT vs years of acne,"I (27F) have been battling with acne since I was 20. It started already a bit before but got worse and worse in my twenties. As I’m not the biggest fan of strong medicine, and use it only if it’s the last option, I tried every trick in the book to get rid of it - prescribed creams, cosmetics, not letting my conditioner/shampoo run down my back (as its body acne mostly, not necessarily my face) etc. I checked my hormones, and it turned out I had high testosterone levels which lead the doctors to think I might have PCOS but apart from the hormones everything was fine, I had no symptoms. I went on birth control for about 2 years called Diane-35 which helped me with my acne, but the side effects were way worse. My weight was fluctuating, I had bad anxiety especially social, my skin was dry and red on my face which looked like a rash, and had a big binge eating problem cause by the depressive states from the pill. 2023 I stopped the pill, went on a diet and lost a lot of weight but as soon as I stopped the pill the acne was back and was back stronger than ever. After feeling completely broken as nothing ever helped in the long run, I started considering accutane, but was afraid of the side effects and that it’d be the same store - I go off the medication and the problem is back and all the money and sacrifice went for nothing. I talked with my chat gpt about my worries and he suggested if I ever noticed improvement after not eating dairy products for a few days and that made me realize I don’t know what „a few days with no dairy” means as dairy products are my favorite. A coffee with milk 2-3x a day, cream cheese, cottage cheese, creamy sauces, carbonara, everything that’s creamy and comforting. So I gave it my answer and decided to try and cut off the dairy and see if there’s any improvement over time as what he told me about the side effects if you’re overly sensitive to the milk hormones (especially skimmed milk) really aligned with my issues. It’s been almost 4 weeks now and I see major improvement, I’ve changed my diet completely now and cut off milk fully, I check every package of a product I suspect might have milk/dairy in it and if it does I do not touch it. I switched my regular coffee with cow milk to coffee with almond milk (10/10 recommend btw) and don’t eat sweet sugary stuff as most of it has dairy. The oiliness and overall look of my face has drastically changed, it’s like my eyes are twice bigger now. Zero new pimples coming out so far only the old ones healing. My mood and sleep are better than ever, everything heals faster as my body is not battling inflammation 24/7 caused by the milk. My mom also confirmed that when I was a little baby, I had issues after cow milk and couldn’t have it at all, which I didn’t know until now when I asked her. I’m so happy and so grateful so far for the fact that I see some change, after years and years of losing my self esteem completely. The only thing that makes me sad is that none of the doctors ever even mentioned that I should check my diet, never wanted to look for the source of the problem, only trying to heal the symptoms by giving me more and more pills and more tests to run which led to nothing.

I (23M) am In a relationship with my girlfriend (27F) for 3.5 years. 
4months into our relationship my gf warned me about a mutual friend from college, that she didn’t have the right intentions with me. I didn’t believe her, long story short after around a year of me fighting with my girl for that girl I discovered that yes that girl did want to get in my pants. To her I emotionally cheated. I agree to that statement somewhat. 

We had ups and downs. The next problem came up when my mutual friend group was still friends with that girl. I couldn’t, didn’t want to lose my friend group with similar mindsets and intentions. We fought again. And although I did cut them all off from my life and moved on it wasn’t without fights with my girlfriend over having them. She had issues with me being friends with girls, I shouldn’t be an easy guy. I should not be the one to have an open shoulder for girls to rely on in any case she said. I agreed. 

Next we fought on my relationship with my family. To her I am a mumma’s boy. There are a lot of personal family issues which I cant get into but I mostly try not to involve her in my family matters. My cousins sisters who I am quite close with was not really liked by my girl since they didn’t respond properly to her advances of friendship through social media. We fought to the point of breakup. Because im not in a phase of life to have to choose between my partner and my family. And I will always love to have my family beside me. She came back and apologised for not understanding family dynamics. She told me it was her fault. We fixed. 

Cut to June 2024, I got the opportunity to move out of town for a much better program for my masters. It is in one of the best institutes for my subject. But that meant moving away 1200kms. We fought again. She told me that she wouldn’t be able to do LDR. She will be having trust issues with me. I told her I will help her be informed about my life there. We fought yes but she let me come to do my masters. Two things happened, one I got a complete makeover with the set of friends I had, and the bad thing I started doing was avoiding or not revealing many things I did like hang out with folks over tea or coffee. Have conversations about life etc. make new friends irrespective of gender.  

September 2024, our class had planned a day trip to a nearby waterfall and forested area. I love the outdoors and she knows this. I informed her and we fought. She didn’t want me to go. There will be girls ill be involved with them. In the process it came up all I had been hanging with folks from class and enjoying my life. She was devastated that I went back to my “old ways” of being a easy-going person. We took space. She let me go to the trip and I facetimed her and we talked about the trip how I wasn’t really hanging with ladies and were with guys. She was happy that I was happy. 

But things didn’t go well, I talked to her she told me yet again avoid a few people from class one being the closest friend I have here., who is a guy btw. I avoided girls but felt like she was pushy with her. She wanted me to block most of the girls from class anyone who had pushed my boundaries a bit. I accept my fault that the boundaries that I put my I don’t do enough maybe to enforce them. We fought and fought. I explained her that I aint doing anything wrong and I don’t think people have the capability to hurt us anymore I wont let that happen but she was adamant. Well, it turned out that yet again her intuitions about few of the girls were right. They didn’t have the best intensions towards me. But in my opinion I had done enough already to block their advances or whatever. In any case she told me and I blocked many of the girls from my class in order to prevent be mistakenly breaking boundaries again.

1oyicr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1oyicr4/what_do_you_think_about_this_am_i_doing_things/,"What do you think about this? Am I doing things correctly, and what is she doing?","
I went through a breakup last year. I went no-contact for a month, then I saw her, invited her for coffee, and confidently told her that I wanted to get her back. And it actually worked. Not immediately—at first she said she didn’t want a relationship—but gradually she started to come back. She was the one texting me, initiating things, and I just let her take the lead. I pulled back, and it worked. After about a month we got back together.

We spent a year together, but now we broke up again.
This time because we have different values and goals. She’s focused on her career, and I’m more family-oriented. We barely spent time together—we would see each other maybe five times a month. She wanted to move into an apartment; we’re both students finishing school, and I told her we should survive one more year in student housing and then move in. She said no.

Now some things have been happening that confuse me.

She suggested we stay friends—which I refused. We’ve been no-contact for a month now. But she reacted to my Instagram story with a heart emoji from a place we both like. When she saw me in person, she couldn’t even open her door properly, maybe she was nervous. I just said “Hi” and kept going. She looked at me, smiled, and asked if I was going to work (I found a part-time job, just like she wanted me to so I could “move forward”). I told her no, that I was going to deal with my internship.

She also texted me on my name day, and it felt nice. I don’t think she’s over me. She once told me she wouldn’t go for a third chance and that she didn’t want to hurt me—but she said that one week after the breakup, when we were just exchanging our stuff. Now her behavior seems different.

At the beginning she even sent me some Reels, but now she stopped and is holding herself back. On the day of the breakup, she apologized twice for her decision. The day after, I went to talk to her and told her I respected her decision, but that I would still give it another try. She didn’t say anything to that. When I was leaving, I kissed her on the forehead and she said, “What are you doing? Friends don’t do that.” And I said, “Then take it as a closing point for the conversation. I’m going to make money now.”

She asked me how I planned to show her that I can change if I don’t want to stay in contact with her. I said, “I don’t know, you’ll see.”

Now I’m just posting normal Instagram stories—nothing sad, nothing aimed at her. Just my life: work, school, and one picture in the elevator where I was dressed well. One photo from the cinema. And the scenic view where she reacted with a heart.
