I'm using a 1:10 ratio, 10g of coffee and 100g water, with an aeropress paper on the filter. I had the hob on setting 3 initially, let it heat up for ages beforehand and used boiling water. It did nothing. I was timing it and it got to 15 minutes and was gurgling and whistling, but absolutely no coffee came out. So I took it all apart, rinsed it out and held it all under cold water until it was fully cooled down and tried again. The second time I put the hob on 4 because I thought maybe it was hot enough to boil, but not quite hot enough to push the coffee out. After 12 minutes it started doing this. I left it for another minute and it just continued spitting out droplets like this. Its also leaking droplets of water even though I'm screwing it on as tight as I possibly can. Its brand new. 

I'm so frustrated, I don't understand why this isn't working? ",1,1735740466.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False

Hope you all have a good 2025!

I am a 24m and have recently got into a long-distance relationship (UK and US) with 23f and I am planning to fly over there in January. We started talking in August 24 and became exclusive in end of November 24 and confessed our love for each other. Things were mostly good, we had a few disagreements here and there but nothing major until the last couple of weeks. During talks, there are certain things that she has not told me about or not been clear about:

\* I knew she had an ex for a year and a half and initially told me they broke up and just became friends, however later on, she said they were FWB after and then stopped. I was annoyed at the fact she hid this rather than the actual past and said the reason she never said was because she didnt think it was important

\* One of the disagreements we had was about her following her ex on socials - i said i felt uncomfortable. she did remove him, but it was after i had to explain why and alot of back and forth.

\* One of her close guy friends i questioned at the start, she said they were just friends and that it was nothing more, but then it came out that they had feelings for each other but never pursued anything when they were young

\* During the time we were speaking but not exclusive, it turns out that she met with her ex for a coffee, but told me it was just a friend.

I honestly dont know what to do, I know we love each other alot, but i know the trust and respect is not there. She says she didnt want to hurt me and that she would do anything for me and is willing to change and show me that she is the best person for me, but i cant help think about the stuff she hid from me, even when i have been open with her from the start. She wants me to forgive her and says she will be 100% open and transparent with me now.

How do i know this person is truly over her ex. They were together for a year till June 22, then broke up and had FWB till Mid 2023 and then the get it as friends, before she told him of no -contact when we became exclusive

Its a hard one, because she actually puts alot of effort in this relationship such as quick replies, good convos/long calls, snaps, Voice notes, compliments and i actually do feel loved, but how can i know she is going to be trustworthy for the future especially for LDR.

Any advice would be much appreciated! If you were in my position what would you do?",1,1735740443.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

And while I am not pro-screens in daycare (my co-workers put it on wayyyyy too much at the end of the day when they could be bringing out new or different toys, for example), I think it shows a lack of understanding of how your child spends most of their day in group care (for the majority of group cares, not all).  Let me explain.

Your child spends a lot of time in ""free play"".  That sounds great, right? Developmentally appropriate and all that.  But it means they are fighting over a desired toy with a friend, waiting for someone else to be done with a desired toy, sitting in the corner watching their friend have a meltdown, or lining up/washing hands/waiting for the bathroom.  Sitting at the table waiting for 16 other friends to get ready for lunch/snack/painting.  Sitting for twenty minutes in the foyer fully dressed to go outside while the abysmally slow teacher tries to get the others' snowpants on.

Yes, we read them books.  Yes, we do circle time.  Yes, we do arts and crafts.  Some (lots?) time is spent redirecting their friend who is disrupting the others' experience.  In fact, everything we do throughout the day is usually interrupted by someone's friend requiring us to drop the plan and deal with the behaviour.  Someone just peed their pants.  Someone else just got a nose bleed.  Someone else has a temp and needs a call home.  Someone is eating the googly eyes.  Someone is screaming because there aren't enough glue sticks.  Someone else is having an early pickup and needs to be got ready.  

And then the teachers. Us.  We are cleaning up.  Because it HAS to be done.  We are spraying the gross toilet.  We are stepping out of the room for our own break.  We are communicating with a staff member.  We are fielding requests in every direction.  We are trying to fuel ourselves with coffee or food.  

So...what ARE you paying for? Do you think that them watching the tablet for twenty minutes is really so much worse than everything else that is going on in the course of the day? Would you rather see twenty minutes of semi-controlled chaos, WWE wrestling, every sock and shoe in the building round-up, and the teacher trying to write accident reports with her back turned?

I will never understand this line of thought that ""I'm not paying for....""  Maybe you don't really realize what you ARE paying for.

I'm not a heavy coffee drinker, but I do enjoy it occasionally. There’s something satisfying about brewing your own coffee and making it part of a routine. I’m thinking about picking up coffee brewing as a hobby or just something to get into. You can consider me a complete beginner when it comes to coffee.

I’m looking for some advice on the following:

1. What kind of beans should I get?
I’ve heard that Blue Tokai beans are good, especially their fruity varieties, which tend to be sweeter. However, I’m not sure how that works, so I would appreciate recommendations.


2. What kind of equipment should I get?
I prefer my coffee to be on the sweeter side, strong, and milk-based. I’m debating between a Moka pot or a Kaldi press. From my research, I’ve seen people recommend avoiding a French press in favor of a Kaldi press or Aeropress.


3. Which is better for my needs: Moka pot or Kaldi press?
Given my preference for sweeter, strong, milk-based coffee, which one would suit me best?


4. What are some good budget-friendly grinders?
My budget is around 3,000 to 4,000 INR, including beans. I’ve ruled out the Aeropress because I would also need to buy a grinder. Any suggestions for good, budget-friendly grinders?


5. Any tips on getting started with coffee brewing?
Any advice on how to start getting into coffee brewing as a hobby would be really helpful.


6. Is there any other equipment I would need?
Apart from the grinder and the Moka pot or Kaldi press, is there any other equipment I should consider for brewing coffee?",1,1735740125.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False
1hr3hi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1hr3hi4/2700_hour_update/,2700 hour update,"Hey everybody, I'm here to provide an update at the 2700 mark after my post yesterday where a handful of folks were asking about such (shout out to  u/betterAThalo, u/JBark1990, u/UppityWindFish, u/onlyhere4the_tea). I'll try to be reasonably comprehensive but can answer other questions in the comments.

# General Overview

I continue to be happy with the progress and am continuing to improve. I've traveled internationally to Spanish speaking countries a few times since beginning this journey and was able to get by without any English. I also find myself having increasing numbers of ad-hoc interactions with Spanish speakers in my day to day life and can understand/eavesdrop on what is going on around me which is cool. The world of content is pretty open to me now but not completely. For example, I am currently watching La Casa de Papel - something that was a comically bad experience earlier on - and with Spanish subtitles on I can follow it. Note: I am somebody who watches everything with subtitles, including in English. Without them here I would miss more but still can follow the plot. Dubbed shows are no problem, but I honestly don't watch much of that. I'm planning to take the DELE C1 next year and am preparing for that - this is purely as a personal challenge. I've taken the practice exams which placed me at the high B2 level which feels about right.

I'll cover each skill further below, but first I'll address a question that comes up in most of my update posts: how do I manage to get 5+ hours of CI a day amidst life, etc? I wear [bone conducting headphones](https://www.amazon.com/Shokz-OpenMove-Headphones-Conduction-Sweatproof/dp/B09BVX8ZXF/ref=sr_1_1_pp?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3FY_weS8fZd1vEseVoiA0qbnDK5jFOFRunD3Amb6bWOXBS1eA1LXZypbLYNZYAy4QJxT9GKcUht0i2ud15WVX8DLpKx67suBtFxl8uHCUT56CQk4-JKbjROOVr3eQM2p_a9faqnZfyhRVxIi93iHEK_oXqb6--qXwAhNyscuYlxZ3CUXjwE3xcRr35Pt-XZbOcXUjcDWedfdOCF0SrL25B_lwLpcLCLn3d65juzf2c4.-K24PPdN7qTCiTtI9uPCnmOUGohozu_67oCggDfGaQg&dib_tag=se&hvadid=616188471754&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9011215&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=17558626914116745329&hvtargid=kwd-1456656787580&hydadcr=4993_13167844&keywords=openmove+shokz&qid=1735737994&sr=8-1) that don't shut out the outside world, and as soon as I wake up I put those on and start a podcast while I am making coffee/breakfast. I do the same as I do chores throughout the day, exercise, drive, etc. They are easy to pause with a button push any time I need to have a conversation. I have the kindle app on my phone, so I can easily read whenever I can stare at my phone. I also do the same for watching videos when I am able to be still. That's essentially it - when you add up the amount of time for filling in the cracks in your day like this it can easily total up to a couple of hours. Add to that 30-60 min on either side of the day in bed, lunch break, workout, and it is pretty attainable without ""making it a thing"". As far as the consistency, it is simply part of my life now. I barely view it as ""needing to do something"", I just do it. I do have goals though and am a very disciplined, goal-oriented person, so there is intrinsic motivation for me.

The other question that comes up is whether I am passively listening or not. I try to focus on the content as much as I can (remember I am at the point where I am just listening to something that interests me and it is less of trying to actively acquire a skill). Of course I sometimes zone out and back in again. This sometimes prompts people to say something about the quality of this input, to which my response has been that I have the goal of learning the language as fast as possible. Therefore, 30 min of half-zoned-out input is better than 0 minutes. I am not seeking to gain the highest level in the language \*with the fewest hours of effort\* - note the subtle difference. I am optimizing for wall-clock time, not study time. Thus my tongue-in-cheek response before has been that you are welcome to craft the optimal hour of input that you consume in a sensory deprivation chamber such that when you provide your 1500 hour update you are further than any DS-follower has been, but for me I am going to not question all that and just put on another podcast. It has worked well for me.

Onto each skill. I'll be honest about these, but keep in mind there is also a Dunning-Kruger effect here. The further you get in the language, the more you realize you do not know. Thus, I don't want folks earlier in the journey to be discouraged if I say something is hard - it is - but I also think you would be more than happy to have the progress I had at each point (you can review my post history for speaking samples and other updates to showcase). I know I am.

# Reading

I started reading this year, and it has been such a great journey. At first, it was a slog and required the most basic of content. I would get sleepy after 15 min and sometimes literally nap. I was also much slower than my reading pace in English for obvious reasons.

At this point, I'd rate myself at maybe an 8-9th grade level. I can now read most adult books, but works like Marquez are still a real challenge with vocabulary. Vocabulary is my biggest gap, and reading helps a lot with that. I do now use the translation feature pretty liberally because it is so easy in the Kindle app, so it is not a purist approach. Reading itself is a lot less taxing now, and I can read a book for an hour or more without fatigue. I'd say my reading rate is about 150-200 wpm which is less than my English but is reasonably comparable. One challenge I have found is consistently finding books - I did not previously realize that many popular books simply do not have a Spanish translation, and the tastes of Hispanic readers are not the same as Americans.

What else do you want to know about reading? Also, here is a full list + word counts of what I have read:

# Writing

My experience here is limited to text exchanges with a few friends or iTalki conversations with my teachers, both of which give me the crutch/benefit of having autocorrect. I expect I would make a lot of accent placement errors if I had to write by hand. Actually formulating what to say is no different than speaking.

# Speaking

My speaking has improved a lot. I have samples from 800 hours onward in my post history for those interested. I think my accent is fine. I've been complimented on it, and most importantly there does not seem to be any trouble being understood. Nobody is ever going to be fooled that I am a native, and I'm just fine with that. I do know my accent slips the most when I am having to focus on other parts of speaking like a conjugation that isn't coming fluidly or unusual words. This also gives me confidence that as I continue to improve so will my accent as I can focus more on that and less on \*what\* to say.

I have around 100 hours of iTalki classes at this point and rotate between 8-10 of my favorite professors, basically all of which are either Mexican or Colombian by preference. I appreciate the ones that correct me and find that helpful reinforcement even if not a purist thing. Mostly these are just conversations, and in particular I like the ones that ask deep questions about interesting topics because it makes the conversation engaging. A few of them are DELE specific and we do exercises together.

Conjugations have gotten relatively easy but still take some mental effort. Sometimes I blank entirely on an irregular verb, but sometimes I find myself constructing with ease some of the more complicated subjunctive/conditional combinations. It keeps getting easier but still has a ways to go.

# Listening

This has been the biggest improvement lately. I almost exclusively listen to native content, and I have found a big increase since 2k hours in my ability to parse what is being said with rapidity by a native. It's a bit of a misnomer that Spanish is a phonetic language because the way letters are pronounced changes when spoken based on what is surrounding them. I found this made it hard to understand WHAT somebody was saying in the past, but that has become tremendously easier. I would say 8 or 9 out of 10 pieces of content in youtube are completely comprehensible. Leyendas Leyendarias has been my barometer of the hardest content I know for some time, and I would say I can comprehend it 75% without reading a transcript along.

# Favorite content lately

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1hr3hbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/thesopranos/comments/1hr3hbg/chris_and_sean_matt_meeting_at_webistic_scam/,Chris and Sean & Matt meeting at webistic scam company...,"The scene was informal and  the lingo was hard to explain

So here is the transcript with explanation according to what I understood


Matt:Hey, Chris, brought you a little capp.

Chris:Thanks

.Chris:Sit down.

Chris:Refresh my memory on this play we're making on Webistics. (The scam)

Matt:We own 400,000 shares at 60 cents.Trade on the bulletin board, OTC.

If we cold-call enough seniors, pump and dump.

The explanation is the company acquired large volume of share at low price. The stocks are over the counter... Meaning it's not listed in major stock exchanges like nasdaq or nyse and susceptible to manipulation and unregulated and more risky

As many know... The Mafia strategy is to inflate the stock price by cold calling seniors who are not financially savvy... Once the price rises due to demand... The Mafia sells off the shares... The Mafia benefit from the increased price while the investor have shares with little value

Chris:Yeah, yeah. You guys ain't spent much time in the NFL, face it.

The explanation is: Chris mocks Sean and Matt for lack of experience in high level operations... Calling them subtly as amateurs

Matt:The fuck What are you talking about? Two years with Eddie Stags

Explanation is Matt... an associate defends himself by saying  that he has the experience proved by one of mafiosos named edfie

.Chris:Besides waxing eddie car.

Chris deflects matt excuse saying that Sean and Matt were doing menial and simple tasks

Sean:- When he was in county...
Sean tries to defend himself only to be shutdown by Chris saying the following... Chris is not interested in arguing chip n dale by saying his advice

Chris:- When you're bleeding a guy......you don't squeeze himdry right away. Contrarily, you let himdo his bidding. Suavely. So you can bleed next week and the week after. At a minimum.

Chris gives an advice about sustainability over short term gain rather than take it all at once... Chris says intimadation and manipulation is better for them being source of profit over time... And must be done subtle and calculatively... Not overt and immediate

Matt: so what you are saying is that We don't need a guy getting pissedand running to the SEC.- Is that what you're saying?

Matt realized that their impulsivity could attract negative attention and putting the entire operation at risk

Chris:- Break it down.

Meaning: internalize and understand the lesson

Matt:- Sorry, Chris.

Matt:- When are we dumping the stock?

Matt the ever eager and impressionable man asks about when they sell the stock... Showing impatient and low understanding of timing required for pump n dump

Chris:You'll know when you need to know.

Chris withholds the information as he is authorative in his answr
Matt:Excellent.

Chris:This is cold, by the way. (the coffee)

Guys.Any more Porsches disappear, make it two towns over. And I want a taste.

Chris tells if they steal more porsches car...make the activity away from the local territory and he expects the cut from doing so to give tribute for the higher ups in the mafia

Matt: You're the man.

1hr3han,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hr3han/niche_cleaning_services_eg_postconstruction/,"Niche Cleaning Services (e.g., Post-Construction)","Alright, let’s dive into the formidable world of specialized cleaning services—because, believe it or not, there's more to it than a mop and a bucket. Trust me, I've tried cleaning my own car with kitchen towels. Spoiler alert: it didn’t end well.

**Equipment Needs:**
First things first, let's talk gear. If you're serious about this venture, then you'd better invest in high-quality equipment that would make even the most seasoned contractor's jaw drop. Think along the lines of:

1. **Commercial-Grade Vacuums** – Not just any old vacuum here; we’re talking about options that suck up everything from fine dust to the rogue cat hair left behind by that feisty feline named Whiskers.

2. **Pressure Washers** – These beauties are like the superheroes of the cleaning world. They can blast away dirt and grime on driveways, sidewalks, and even your in-laws’ judgment (but I'm kidding on that last one… mostly).

3. **Floor Scrubbers** – Because who has time to get down on their knees and scrub tiles like it’s 1820? These machines make cleaning look effortless, which is just how I like to do my life—effortlessly, with plenty of coffee breaks.

4. **Specialized Tools** – Depending on your niche—windows, post-construction or biohazard cleaning—you’ll need specific tools that can tackle those unique challenges. It’s like having a Swiss Army knife, but for cleanliness.

**Marketing to Contractors:**
Now, onto the glorious (and slightly terrifying) world of marketing. You’ve got the tools; now let’s get them into the hands of contractors:

1. **Networking** – Get out there and rub elbows with the construction crowd. Attend trade shows, join local contractors' associations, and don’t shy away from grabbing coffee with that one contractor who seems to know everyone (you know, the one with the booming laugh and contagious enthusiasm).

2. **Online Presence** – You want a website that sparkles as much as your cleaning services do. Showcase before-and-after photos, client testimonials, and offer informative blog posts that share tips and tricks. This approach not only demonstrates your expertise but will keep you entrenched in the minds of those contractors searching for help.

3. **Social Media** – Get visual with Instagram and Facebook. We all know a good before-and-after pic can lure in even the most skeptical of contractors. Make that feed fun and relatable. Share not just cleaning tips but the occasional blooper from your cleaning crew—thankfully, I’ve learned to avoid filming my attempts at getting a spider out of a corner without hyperventilating.

4. **Direct Mail & Email Campaigns** – Old school? Perhaps. But a catchy postcard or email can stick out in a crowded inbox. Include offers for discounted services for first-time clients. Everyone loves a good deal!

**Pricing Strategies:**
Finally, let’s chat dollars and cents. Pricing is all about being competitive without throwing your value out the window, so consider these strategies:

1. **Competitive Analysis** – Check out what others are charging in your area. You’ll want to set your prices to reflect your quality and expertise—not just what’s typical. It’s a little like cooking; you want it flavorful but not so spicy they can’t handle the heat.

2. **Tiered Pricing** – Offer different packages depending on the level of service. A basic clean, deep cleaning, and specialized services could draw in a wider range of contractors. Plus, who can resist a good upsell?

3. **Value Additions** – Communicate the benefits of your services—speed, efficiency, expertise—so contractors see your pricing as a worthy investment rather than just an expense.

4. **Volume Discounts** – For your larger contractors who might need your services regularly, consider offering a discount for bulk contracts. It’s a great way to keep those cash flows steady.

As with all things in life and business, it’s important to stay flexible, gauge the needs of your clients, and keep that communication flowing. You'll be washing away the competition in no time, all while forming bonds and turning cleaning services into something much more profound—community building. Remember, every scrubbed floor can lead to another opportunity to connect people, serve needs, and transform spaces. Now that's a shiny way to approach business!",1,1735740103.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I'll admit I've never been a huge partier so going all out on New Year's Eve has never appealed to me however I always enjoyed working them because most people are in a fantastic mood -- emphasis on most. Though my favorite part, maybe it's petty, is the morning of New Years Day. If I'm on the desk I will happily enjoy my coffee while watching the hungover revelers stumble and bumble their way into the lobby.

This year at my new property we're pretty empty. Barely 20% occupancy in what's normally a very busy corporate-travel focused hotel so we don't typically get many party goers but wow did the ones we have go all out. This morning, I have been enjoying my peppermint mocha while watching people shuffle from the elevators and moan ""Coooffffeeeeee"" in various forms. I'd like to share tiny snippets from it so far:

* A man in pajamas walked into the wall directly across the elevators, bonked his head, and stated in a groggy voice: ""Why is there a wall here?""
* A family of four all in matching pajamas arrived. The parents were trying to get the kids to play The Quiet Game because ""mommy and daddy's grown up juice made them sick."" Their words not mine.
* A heavily disheveled couple came to the desk and tried to communicate. I couldn't understand them because they weren't using words so much as grunts and attempts at speech. They pointed to my coffee cup so I gently guided them to where the coffee station was. 
* This one is my favorite so far. My housekeeping supervisor, Jan, was at the desk with me getting the list of all the late check outs (there's a lot for us today). An older man, I want to say around 50-60, walked out from the elevators and stopped next to the business center to stare at our breakfast area. He turned to us and asked, ""Fi fi?"" Jan and I looked at each other then back to him and asked him to repeat. He then said, ""Co fi fi?"" Jan and I sighed then guided him to where the coffee was.

Do I just need to potty train him again normally? I got training treats and do the praise and reward every time I’m taking him out so hopefully I see progress soon (been 5 days). 

The vet isn’t concerned that it’s a health issue as throughout the daytime he still acts completely normal and doesn’t have accidents. We leave him out to roam the main floor when at work (about 8 hours) and he never has accidents so I know he’s able to go that long without having to go.

She had severe lacerations and punctures and had to have emergency surgery. She's ok and will heal up fine but now we're saddled with large medical bills.

Some background info: 
We are travelling professionals currently in Albuquerque, NM and we're living at an RV park. My wife had tied our dogs up outside our RV (about 8-10ft tethers) and gone back inside to get her morning coffee. During that couple minutes a neighbor was walking her 2 German shepherds past our camper when one of her dogs slipped it's leash, ran up to our dogs, and attacked one of them. The GSD was uninjured by my dog had to have surgery last night to stitch her back up. 
The neighbor had initially been apologetic and said ""oh i didn't see them"" and that they would help with medical bills since their dog did all the damage and was off leash, but then later in the day we got a text saying they weren't going to pay for anything since my wife left our dogs unattended when it happened which is against the RV park policy. 

We called animal welfare and they will be conducting interviews and gathering evidence, but I'm not sure what the timeline will be. The vet bill was $1300 yesterday, with follow-up appointments to come. 

I guess I'm just curious if anyone here knows if I have any legal standing to pursue recouping the costs of my dogs medical bills. I'm scared that I'm SOL because we technically broke the RV park rules and left our dogs outside (tied up) unattended when it happened. I'm not sure if the park rules matter legally, since her dog slipped it's leash, but I have no idea.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! ",1,1735739492.0,legaladvice,0,1.0,False

I saw a dentist as a new patient three months ago and he flagged three cavities. I never got them filled due to issues/confusion with my insurance. That has since been cleared up. 

I’m going back to the dentist tomorrow and I’m terrified he’s going to tell me that my cavities have become root canals, or that the root canal tooth I do have (uncrowned, next to one of my front teeth) needs to be extracted. My mind keeps running through every single worst case scenario. I basically rang in the new year with extreme anxiety (I was very close to a panic attack last night, but my boyfriend calmed me down by taking my mind off it). 

I admittedly wasn’t taking the best care of my teeth before then, but I’ve been very consciously improving my habits since then (Brushing twice, flossing, mouthwash, I was even oil pulling for the longest while). I’ve also cut back on sugar a lot, to the point where my only real consistent intake is coffee in the morning. But I’m terrified, especially because my brain is latching onto every sensation/sensitivity in my mouth (there are certain points in my mouth where I feel pressure, but it’s hard to ascertain because I don’t know how much of it is amplified by the psychological aspect. 

There’s nothing I can do but wait until my appointment tomorrow for answers, but it’s going to feel like purgatory the whole time. ",1,1735738399.0,offmychest,0,0.66,False

Now ive pulled a couple of shots and it just comes out way too fast and makes a total mess. I suppose this is because the grinder isnt able to grind fine enough? Or could it be something with the machine? I know the previous owner installed the 9 bar opv spring kit on it and changed the showerscreen to a - IMS Gaggia 200µm precision showerscreen - nanotech.

I also tried grinding a couple of extra times and tamping alot harder on the second shot to kind of compress it more but i got the exact same result. ",3,1735738057.0,gaggiaclassic,7,1.0,False

Before Nespresso I was used to a UK Costa Small or Medium which is roughly between 200-277 of caffeine.

It's only day 2 but when I first had the 2 pods of Napoli the caffeine hit was nothing like Costa I didn't know any increase in energy or alertness. I appreciate Costa would use larger amounts of coffee per shot so assume this might have something to do with it.

May be my caffeine tolerance was to high due to all the Costas. So just wondering if there will be an adjustment period of feeling the effects of Nespresso if I continue to use these pods. Has anyone else gone from regular coffee shop coffees to Nespresso and now feel the caffeine effects more so than before?

1hr2u7z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hr2u7z,Infinis Nutrition Ultra Pre Review ,"
Today we have Infinis Nutrition’s Ultra. Been out about a year and I’ve been wanting to try it so finally got it and giving it a go. High end daily driver category, a category I particularly like and prefer to use for Chest, Shoulders and Tricep day. I find them to perform at a  very high level and give a nice respite from high stim products. A good way to start the new year. 

Scoop/Taste/Mixing-Flavor was “Strawberry Passionfruit”  and man was it good. An all time great flavor next to Kaged Elite’s Strawberry Lemonade for me. Didn’t have any chemical taste and only a slight chalkiness at the end. Scooper was a little heavy, just under a full scoop gets you to a correct weight and 2 scoops are a serving. Mixed well considering all the ingredients, just one rinse out cleaned it up. 

Energy-Good, mild and sustained. No sense of urgency and no drop off during session, felt same start to finish. Energy components around 370mg of caffeine from multiple sources, synephrine and theobromine. Smaller amount of l theanine isn’t a wet blanket 


Endurance/power output- Very high level. Did not get fatigued with higher volume sets. Not a lot of rest between heavy sets. Fast twitch muscles firing well. Felt like a high end formula 

Focus/mood-very good. Mental energy on higher level to compensate for lesser physical energy. Dialed in and in the moment. 
No real notice or mood elevation though none was expected 

Pumps- Pumps were outstanding and performed as well as the label. In addition to the Citrulline, a dull dose of Nitrosigne , Citrapeak and VasoDrive-AP for the vascular effect. Well rounded., full and vascular. Like throwing some caffeine in a pump formula. 

Overall- About what you would expect from the label. A high end daily driver that feels like a daily driver and performs at very high level. He kind of pre that is fun not from a stimulant or mood elevation standpoint but one to get down to serious business and to get to the instant gratification of visual result on your physique. More of a luxury pre that a necessity pre. Very good and makes we want to try other products from their line but still not the best in this category for me, which would be Dethroner 2 or V1 Ultimate

1hr2rhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeLonghi/comments/1hr2rhe/til_water_circuit_empty_could_mean_blockage_in/,"TIL: ""Water Circuit Empty"" could mean blockage in outlet instead of air in the circuit","Just want to share this as it seems there was no such case found on internet.

I have a 2 years plus old De'Longhi Eletta Cappuccino bean-to-cup machine (ECAM 44.660.B). So I was replacing filter today, and carelessly didn't let the air in the new filter fully escape. Then when I put the tank back and select ""Replace Filter"" option, the hot water flow stopped halfway, and ""Water Circuit Empty Fill Water Circuit"" error popped up.

Following the [FAQ](https://www.delonghi.com/en-gb/faqs/My-machine-is-displaying-%E2%80%98Empty-Circuit--Fill-Circuit%E2%80%99_-What-can-I-do/a/8489) in delonghi website, I tried to restart the process a few times, which didn't help. In despair I tried to dissemble the machine to get to the pump where ""the air should be stuck in"", following [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1pdIic41BM). **That turned out to be a mistake**, my model is different and this Eletta model features multiple rare types of screws -- they are not meant to be dissembled at home. I broke one of those screws in the process.

But when I was to give up, I noticed the rinse function still worked (hot water through the coffee outlet), and when I pulled the water tap out, a bit of high pressure steam was released. So I tried poking a 3D printing nozzle needle into the water outlet after removing the tap. Then voila! All back to normal. It must be some solid residues attached in the new filter blocked this very tiny hole, and when the machine didn't detect hot water flow, it thought it was the circuit being empty!",1,1735737465.0,DeLonghi,0,1.0,False

Before 10-11AM I go to pee at least 4-5 times. And I pee a lot. I always thought that it is because I drink too much coffee during the day.

I did some tests and the following came out:

Cholesterol 201 (max 200).
Albumin in urine 56.80 (max 20 mg/l)
Albumin / Krea Ratio 50.7 (max max 30 mg/g)

All other results were good. Also I tested also blood sugar and I have no signs of diabetes. 

I never had problems with too high cholesterol. Neither with Albumin. To mention that Albumin level 6 months ago was above the limit but still the half of the today’s value (round 25 mg/l). This was the first red flag. 

Urlologist said that I have a bit a thickened bladder wall and gave me some pills to reduce the urinary frequency.

The nephrologist said that I am healthy, my kidney and everything is fine and gave me some pills to lower the albumin level in the urine. 

They all try to treat the sympthoms but which is the cause?

I was also taking long time different medicine for depression etc. and I am thinking that this might have affected something. Or maybe the supplements I was taking (Omega 3, Coenzime Q10, some homeopatic stuff).

I own a Magnifica S automatic bean to cup machine which I bought in Germany back in 2020. It has given me many wonderful coffees and I brought it back with me in 2022 when I moved back to India. I've used it sparingly since and barely in 2024. 

I'm moving to Spain next week and am keen to carry the machine with me. Couple of questions and open to all suggestions on my situation: 

1. Do you guys think it's worth transporting it all the way back to Europe again?
2. Considering it's been a year since last use, I'll definitely have to descale it. But is any other servicing necessary if I'm taking it to Spain? 
3. The machine did make a weird noise the first couple of times I operated it after transporting it from Germany to India, but it seemed to work fine later. Unsure if I should just buy a new machine there or take this there to service it.

You’re running a thriving agency, and business is booming. You’ve got multiple clients, all demanding top-tier service, and a never-ending flood of tasks, deadlines, and meetings. You try juggling it all—spreadsheets, endless email threads, and half-baked project management tools.

But deep down, you know the truth: things are slipping through the cracks.

Here’s the deal. If you’re managing multiple clients without a system designed to keep you laser-focused, you’re risking more than a missed deadline. You’re risking your reputation, your revenue, and your sanity.

Please ignore the ikea chair aswell as the white furniture on the left, all of that is going away soon, the place was already furnished with a lot of things that the previous owner left and im slowly removing it and adding my own things

Here are the 2 tables im considering for the space :

\- This glass one i think would fit nicely into the space, I also think its really unique looking, it sadly is glass though so while beautiful it comes it its downsides

\- The second one is a bit cheaper, still nice and unique, but im afraid the wood is going to clash with the rest of the furniture which is a bit darker (I would probably get that one if I wasnt afraid it would clash with the rest of the furniture, as its more practical, although less pretty than glass)

If you have any other tables to recommend let me know ! (know i have a budget of 400 euros max, and im obviously in europe, so anything in the UK / US is out of the cards as i dont want to pay massive shipping fees.

I am an accidental recluse and I want to expand my social life. I got in touch with her and we agreed to meet up today at 10:00. I was excited and happy. 

Unfortunately, I stayed up late waiting for my husband to come home from work (happy new year, full of sarcasm and existential dread) and, as a result, only got 5-6 hours of sleep because our little one acts as our alarm clock. We'd agreed that he'd get a lie-in, which he did, and when he woke up I would get a nap. Balance achieved. However, in the haze of premature waking I'd forgotten to set an alarm so that I could wake up on time to be with my friend and she came and went away. She rang and texted me but because I don't sleep with my phone next to me, I missed it all until I came downstairs. I rang and apologised, you'd think that all is well. 

But I feel terrible. Not only did I let my only friend down twice in three months (I also cancelled on her in September, and we both struggle with meeting up as it is), my husband is working again today and he arranged for our little one to spend the night at her nana's, probably so that I could get a break and we could spend the night doing couple things. Neither of these things are inherently bad, malicious, or anything, but it feels like I'm becoming the meme of ""forever alone"", or insol (involuntarily solitary). I didn't ask for the pandemic to destroy my illusions of good social skills, or my desire to socialise. But I'm struggling so hard to figure out what I'm supposed to do with my day today, now that everyone I could have spent it with is unavailable. Or dumped. Yes, I am blaming myself for sabotaging yet another relationship. How could I forget a meet up that I arranged, this shit doesn't happen to me. 

I feel so guilty for having slept in and inadvertently cancelling plans with my friend and I'm so sad that I won't even have my kid to focus on while husband's at work. All I have to occupy me now is housework, which feels unbearable right now, YouTube videos, which feel like the worst substitute for company at the moment, looking for work, which also feels unbearable, and waiting for my husband to commence his shift so that I can ring him and, signal depending, have a chat to distract me from my loneliness. 

But, physically, no matter what, I'll still be alone. Neighbours don't just knock on each other's doors and come in for a coffee where I live and my body just wants to be around other bodies.

I start overanalyzing everything I'm doing—how I'm standing, the way I'm holding my phone, or how long it’s taking me to decide on my order. Even though, I know realistically no one is paying that much attention, it feels like every move I make is under a microscope, and it overwhelms me.
How do I overcome this?

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 30M and from the UK.

I'll try keep this short and sweet, unlike me. I'm your typical British tall skinny white guy.

I'm on the search for a serious relationship with someone who I click with and we just get it. Someone who has the time and effort to invest in creating a lasting bond, who I can be my silly self around without worry about being judged.

I believe love is a choice. You choose to stick with that person through thick and thin, supporting each other at every opportunity so that we can grow and build a future together.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I've got a 5 year old daughter from my previous relationship who I absolutely adore. She's my little mini me! Looking to the future I'm not against having more children or becoming a step parent.

A little about me:

For context I have recently started volunteering to transport wildlife. Over the holidays recently I had to transport an injured animal. As I had been driving for over an hour I was hoping to stop somewhere for a bite to eat and a drink or coffee before heading home. The location was regional and very lovely. Also known for wineries. I bumped into the chef of the estate ( which was closed ) and asked if anything was open and he offered to whip me something up since I had done something kind. He seemed nice enough so I agreed. At first the conversation was quite normal although I was feeling like he was being too nice but then he told me about a couple who had a hit an animal nearby and totalled their car so they helped them out with somewhere to stay and food etc whilst the couple organised a hire car. Once I started eating he asked me if I drank and then he asked if I smoked weed. Both of these questions set off alarm bells and I was thinking wtf/ very uncomfortable at that point.  The very next question was if I had a partner which made me really uncomfortable so yes I lied. He said he didn’t believe me (for a racial reason). That reasoning irritated me but I didn’t say anything I let him have his assumption. He also said sone thing complaining about women in general which I ignored as I did not want to argue. He then said I could hang out the rest of the afternoon. I thanked him for one of many times and left probably 5 minutes after I finished eating. He probably was insulted I felt uncomfortable and felt I had to lie. I am not very experienced with the opposition the opposite gender. Was I being paranoid/overreacting?

I'm thinking of starting a coffee channel.  I'm not sure whether I want to do shorts or not but I do prefer mid-form content (viz 5 - 20 min videos).  I've noticed some niches in the content most coffee creators have seemingly moved away from, experiments that anyone can try.  Lance used to be big on these but he's since moved to experimenting with equipment outside of most people's budgets.  Other creators seem fixated on doing reviews.  Reviews are cool but I think this has saturated the space.

For my content, I want to conduct some experiments mostly with manual espresso.  I want to highlight my Leverpresso Pro, since literally no one else talks about it.  I want to extol the virtues of non-58mm filter baskets, particularly 51mm; FYI i mentioned the benefit of deeper pucks months ago before Lance did. And I think I want to go around coffee shops in cape town, to speak to owners about what makes their shops successful, and maybe do some head to head shot pulls between my LP and their commercial machines.  Lastly, if i get a following, I want to highlight some coffee producers and agricultural scientists working to help keep the coffee industry viable in the face of climate change.  I have some farm contacts in Congo, Uganda and here in South Africa, as well as a friend researching crossbreeding heat and drought resistant plants.    
  
What do you guys think of these ideas?  Would you care to learn about how we do coffee in Africa?

I've been curious all through these years what the fuzz was all about and what it looks inside. Been intimidated din kasi I really don't know how the games were played, I didn't know the rules and etiquette, and I didn't know how much to bring (or be prepared to lose).

Good thing na open na ang Solaire North and it's pretty accessible by MRT. I don't usually use the MRT but since I had extra time and extra Beep card credits, why not.

Ang alam ko lang from childhood is ""Lucky Nine"", which is actually what ""Baccarat"" is all about. So ayun, I played ""Tiger Baccarat"" with only 3k pesos as max na gagastusin. Solaire North was not that full (at least today, bilang New Year's day pa) and may mga tables na walang players. That gave me the opportunity to chat with the dealer/s a bit and ask for instructions.  Mababait  and patient naman sila in giving the instructions (there are other interesting rules kasi vs the usual ""Lucky Nine"" sa tambayan, including yung mga Big Tiger and Small Tiger ""side bets"").

Minimum to play per round is 1k pesos pero yung mga ""side bets"" you can play with 100 pesos. I was lucky enough to stretch my 3k to 2 hours, and nabigyan  pa ako ng coffee and water (for free) ng mga roving ladies lol. There was a time na I even had 20k pesos of winnings --- I should have stopped there pero iba talaga yung pull ng playing. I eventually lost it all, and forked another 3k pesos na super bilis naubos (mga less than 10 minutes ubos na! --- kasi masasanay ka to be bolder and place bigger bets vs yung more conservative approach when you just started)

So all in all 6k pesos for 2 hours and 10 minutes of playing --- and to satiate my curiosity --- while getting freebie drinks. Not the most responsible thing to do for the opening of the new year, pero I really just wanted to tick it off my list and get it out of my system.

I can thus say na naturally addicting talaga ang Casino and the house will eventually win. The human brain is vulnerable to addictive tendencies and alam na alam na ng Casinos ang neural science and social science for you to keep playing and eventually lose it all.

At 6k pesos lost for ""lesson learned"" and ""tuition fee"" for firsthand experience I'm good na, and can say to strangers here on Reddit na wag na i-try: Smoking is allowed sa floors kaya it smells like secondhand smoke; ang daming Boomers na parang dead-eyed staring at slot machines; the cheap perfumes of the roving ladies are nauseating to smell; at parang hindi talaga masaya like ""joyful"" sa loob and there's an air of just sadness inside.

But I guess if you want to satiate your curiosity for curiosity's sake, just put the necessary parameters in place and be ready to lose it all. Or win it all! Basta, be responsible!

my diet is to illustrate the point of eaing under the recommended and packing it on

6 drumsticks chicken 12\*6 = 72

2 cups milk cheerios 20   
P&j sandwich 4 teaspoons 20

Creatine, malate, weigh protein.

Doing the math this puts me at 120-130 a day for 4 months with the chicken i eat a small portion of carbs so probably 2000-2500 calories and 120-150 protein for a person that sucks at macros.  I have switched to maintenance mode today but keeping the protein above 120 at least but this may lead to more weight gain 176 to 215 as well, bloated but visible abs

My question, if your body type puts it on quickly with under the recommended dosage .8 or 1lbs protein can the calories, is there a different method I can one can follow or a read up on this?",0,1735734134.0,StrongerByScience,3,0.33,False

25 Males here. I am a software engineer so my whole day is spent in front of the computer. My typical job routine is 10 to 6. Lately, I have been too focused on work, neglecting my body and brain's needs.   
  
I have some bad habits to lose: 

1. Watching P\*rn and masturbating at least twice a week.  
2. Junk food at midnight every time (I gained over 30kg so far) I watch p\*rn or feel bored. 
3. Gaming once in a while.  
4. Spending too much time on mobile scrolling reels.
5. Inconsistency in the gym is one of the reasons it is far away from my home. Another is waking up in the morning late if I have PMOed the last day. 
6. Black coffee addict.

My routine:

1. Meditate every day right after waking up, I have noticed my mind is too weak and quickly gives in to urges. I have to fix this. **(7 AM to 7: 10 AM)** 
2. Will try to take a membership of the one nearby gym ideally should be within walking distance. **(7:30 AM to 9:30 AM)**  
3. Will be using digital detox (app) to block time in the morning. No browsing the internet and all stuff in the morning. 
4.  Reading and personal projects in the evening. I have taken personal office space outside my work. This helps sometimes to stay away from p\*rn. **(8 pm to 12 pm)**

For my diet, I have started to consume green tea as a replacement for black coffee. Being conscious of what I eat helps. But, long way to go.

My wife and I are seeing a lot of ADHD symptoms. I always suspected I had it but never diagnosed. 

I saw a nurse practitioner yesterday for pre surgery blood test and I mentioned what I found. He referred me for testing but told me it will be a seriously long wait. He can't prescribe meds for it but my normal family doctor can. I see him in March. Wondering if I can convince him to prescribe low dose stimulants to try? I don't want to scare him away thinking im only trying to get high or something. I just want this internal feeling of fatigue type pressure to go away so I can get things done for once in my life.

Im 45 and you would think I'd have my life figured out by now but I've learned to cope. Could never hold a job long term. Always dreaded going to sleep which meant my fun was over until I woke up and got thru another day of work. This thinking would always keep me up until 5am trying to extend time I can relax (but was never really relaxed) 

After thinking about how so many aspects of my life have been wasted up until now, I wonder what its like to live a normal life. My wife is amazed at how I feel and my thougjt process for doing anything even just simple task.

I am a single straight 30 year old guy in Kolkata.

Start the new year with a new adventure and join me for a coffee date at a beautiful cafe, my treat. No strings attached.

Few pointers about me:
• I am a well educated and a very curious soul.
• Have an adventurous spirit. Down for anything that gets my heart pumping and me jumping.
• Love talking about Philosophy, Psychology, Football, Food, Stocks, Coffee, TV Shows and frankly anything that piques my interest. It is pretty diversified.
• Hate getting ""labelled"". I will surprise you with my thoughts and opinions.
• Believes that the world exists in grey, not black or white.
• Works in Finance & IT.
• Not Handsome. But, Smart. Kind of a Dad bod. Taller than the average Indian man.
• Not gonna share any pictures or ask you for yours before our first meet.

The least I hope to get out of our meet is decent coffee and decent company. Brownie points if you are a smoker and want to share a joint.

So, if all this sounds good and is something you want to experiment with, shoot me a message here or on Telegram. ID is the same as my username here.

Looking forward to getting to know you.

P.S. Yes, I have an alternate personality. The one you would probably label as a pervert. But, that is not my entire being. It's a part of it, like so many other parts. Peel them all, maybe..? Like an onion.",1,1735733579.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False
