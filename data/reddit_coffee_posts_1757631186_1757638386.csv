1nepkgr,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1nepkgr/date_has_screenshots_of_his_female_co_workers_on/,Date has screenshots of his female co workers on his phone,I went on a date with this seemingly nice guy who works at a coffee shop I frequent at. The date was fine. But before the date ended he was scrolling though his phone to show me a picture. He was shamelessly letting me see the other pictures on his phone as he tried to find it. And we’ll - most of his saved pictures were screenshots of his co workers….all female. They weren’t sexy photos or what I would consider thirst traps - just selfies or hiking pics screen-shotted from instagram. It creeped me out and I wont be seeing him again. But has anyone experience anything like this? Could it possibly be innocent?,1,1757638119.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False
1nepjrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BehaviorAnalysis/comments/1nepjrx/help_me_understand_my_friends_55f_strange/,Help me understand my friend’s (55F) strange communication patterns.,"I have a friend who is very “together” when she’s together, but occasionally there are some cracks in her shell that have me asking questions about what might really be happening with her. 

For example: 

A couple of months ago she texted that she had bumped into my former colleagues and they had asked about me, all very warm and fuzzy. 

A couple of days later she sent a long and kind of crazy text that made it sound like she wound up defending me in that same conversation and had told them what she really thought about my previous work environment. 

I got confused because I still talk to them and wasn’t sure why if they had a question they wouldn’t just ask me themselves. It didn’t make sense so I asked her about it and then received a second wacky intense reply and then a third one that said, “Next time I’ll
stay in my lane.”

It isn’t whatever they talked about that I’m wondering about, more concerned about what causes the normal/crazy/crazy/confusing/back to normal communication pattern. It’s happened before around a different topic. There have been days we’ve met up for coffee where she seems like a low key basket case. 

What’s the deal? Personality disorder? Drunk texting? ",1,1757638063.0,BehaviorAnalysis,0,1.0,False

1nepj8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/mounjarouk/comments/1nepj8i/bit_concerned_about_the_final_stages/,Bit concerned about the final stages,"So I’m 30m, on 15mg and I guess I’d expect to be eating like a toddler, but I’m not. So far this journey has been so much slower than everyone else’s. People seem to be like “6 stone off in 6 months!” and I’ve always been shocked. 

I’m down 50lb since march 2024. I’m finally getting body confidence, but I’m not there yet. I’m 185cm, 216lb. I want to get to 190lb roughly? 26lb more to go. The weight loss is slowing right down now. But over the last 3 weeks I’ve been a bit inconsistent with weight lifting. And pretty much consistently other than 2 months in Asia I’ve barely done over a few thousand steps a day unless I’m out for an activity. My overall energy expenditure is shockingly low but I do lift heavy weights so I’ve maintained some muscle mass which is what I was keen for. 

I feel like as I come to the end of my journey I should start being a bit more meticulous with tracking calories. (I haven’t tracked calories and I’ve lost 70lb+ from my biggest. I’ve found counting troublesome but as the margins are getting finer I think maybe I should try? I just find it so invasive. 

 main worries are:

Plateauing, not losing much more weight.
Coming off and putting it all back on. 

Any tips and advice for this next push (26lb) 

I had my injection on Sunday. 

What I ate today:

Small sweet potato circled with olive oil and air fried 
Chicken breast broccoli 
Coffee, Pepsi max
Banana
Prawn mayo sandwich 
Tiny portion of pub chips 
Some cereal (finished 80%)

I’ve calculated 1700-2000

I don’t really want to be eating 500 calories a day cause that’s just not healthy or realistic to maintain either. 

Any advice welcome ",1,1757638020.0,mounjarouk,1,1.0,False

1neph1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/FeatherInInk/comments/1neph1m/one_thousand_six_hundred_and_eightyfourth_night/,One Thousand Six Hundred And Eighty-Fourth Night,"Another good day of writing. Mostly warm and mostly sunny. It does feel like the plot progression of I'm Still Sisyphus is slowing a little but that is to be expected sometimes; some plot point just take more words. I wrote 546 words in the actual story and I also added 155 more words to the outline. I really like what I got down and may actually write a little more tonight. I am really looking forward to bringing the new bits of outline to life. It is also strange to me that I am still only at 181 pages. Now even at 200 pages and we are already halfway through the story; oh, the joys of not having to slave over sex scenes. I really do think this story isn't going to be any longer than 450 pages. I am very much looking forward to not having to try to edit a brick.

What else can I tell you? We could of course talk about current events; Riots, assassinations, convictions, genocides, & anniversaries. Given the date and all that has happened, current events are very much clouding my mind. It was hard to look away from it all to do my writing. I doubt it would do me well to be too specific about what I do and do not condemn and what I am and I am not in favour of so I'll spare you a rant. All I will say is that I would have expected myself to be more surprised. I am not. I did not see a lot of what has happened coming but even the most out of left field event was accepting by my brain with little more than a shrugging or wincing 'yeah, that would happen.' I can't say for certain if it is just me who is so dulled to the world. I don't even wonder what will happen next. The certainty that more will always keep happening is enough to keep me from worrying. I won't say whether that is a healthy mindset or not. One specific I must comment on is that a pro-gun political activists being gunned down at a debate about mass shootings under a 'prove me wrong' sign is the pinnacle of American Irony. If anybody other than fate wrote it they'd be called a hack.

Now, I can retreat into my little corner of the world and relax for a while. I am quite looking forward to my evening coffee. I wonder what sweet I should have with it?

Yours & Mine,

☕[Tip Jar ](http://buymeacoffee.com/oldbublysoul29)I enjoy doing these weekly posts & hope that others have found them to be resourceful. If you would like to toss a coin or two (thanks in advance!!), I’ve set up a Buy Me a Coffee page.

1nepfzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeNewFriendsHere/comments/1nepfzd/29m_lets_chat_and_see_what_happens/,29M Lets chat and see what happens,"I'm looking to make some new friends on here. Im from the east coast of USA. Usually, I am always able to chat most of the time or day. Looking for any type of chats. Hopefully, it will be more long-term but also down for short-term chats too. I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best. I'm trying to slowly get into doing more and more homesteading

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. I also have one cat and one dog too.

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Palworld and Ark ASA. Just bought Dinkum, too. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago.

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",1,1757637746.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1nepfsb,https://i.redd.it/4kangs9drmof1.jpeg,Motor City Match- Coffe and Beats Social Mixer,"Hey Detroit 👋 (trying this again)

I’ve been thinking a lot about how hard it can be to make new friend as an adult. Apps can get exhausting like Bumble BFF or meet-ups, and outside of bars, there aren’t many options to just meet people face-to-face.

So I’m putting together something new: Motor City Match: Coffee & Beats Social Mixer — a fun, low-pressure event for ages 22–45 to meet new people over coffee, music, and conversation. Think: cozy café vibes, icebreakers, and good energy —

📍 Metro Detroit 🕒 Wednesday evenings (early October) ☕ Coffee • 🎶 Music • 💬 Icebreakers • 🤝 Connections

Right now I’m just gauging interest. If enough people sign up, the first event goes live in October.

Would love to hear your thoughts — and if you know someone who’d enjoy this, please share! If you click the link, you will see a place in the form where you can verify I’m a real person via LinkedIn. Note- my location does say New York, but I’m in town for a few months and wanted to host something more curated.",5,1757637729.0,Detroit,0,1.0,False

[$3,000]","I'm planning to buy an espresso machine for a **small coffee cart business** (60 coffees per event). I'm just starting and testing this business in my small city.

And I'm in between a Nuova Simonelli Appia Life Compact or Musica.

But it's hard for me to understand why one cost the double than the other?  
Both have pretty much the same specs, right?  
Both have:  
\- One group  
\- Auto-Volumetric  
\- Heat Exchange  
\- Pre-Infusion System  
\- Direct Connect to water supply  
What makes one (in paper) being able to pull more shots per hour than the other???? Doesn't each shot take around 25-30seg no matter the machine?????

Please someone explain it to me like I'm 5!!

Thank you!! :)",1,1757637511.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

It would be free, so not sure if it's against any laws or anything.



I work totally remote and am getting cabin fever being inside all day, especially since it's starting to get dark earlier. I think it would be fun and a nice way to help brighten everyone's day, plus I think it'd be cool just talking with other folks for a bit.

1nepcqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/unrequited_love/comments/1nepcqn/finally_was_able_to_distance_myself_from_him_he/,"Finally was able to distance myself from him, he came back today.","To start, this is mostly a rant, I feel like I know the answer here. But here we go. Very classic story, I developed very real feelings for a colleague. He and I got along so so well, I was deeply attracted to him, we had the same sense of humor, could spend hours together easily. He was interesting, and KIND, and smart, and (you guessed it) in a relationship. 

I found out the last part a good while into us working together and it felt like a bomb, but it brought me back to reality. I was grateful that I had never pushed any physical boundaries (which for me is saying something, I am a physical flirt usually). It made work difficult, a lot of highs and lows. I couldn’t help the way I felt and I saw him all the time. But I never revealed the way I felt about him, and it pains me because I know he views me as a true friend, and has expressed this many times. I would love to be his friend too, but know how difficult that would be. 

In June, he ended up leaving the company to pursue another opportunity, I was extremely sad, but did feel free. We did not speak very much at all between then and now.

This week, he reached out saying he was in my city again and would love to get a coffee. I immediately said yes, I was so excited to see him, even giddy, but was expecting his situation being the same. We cordially met up, and I mentioned at the end that I was interviewing at other companies. Right away he mentioned that his new company was hiring for my role, and he was saying how much he would love to work with me again. I was not expecting this at all, and honestly didn’t even know his company had a branch in my city. I didn’t know what to say, but said I would be open to it.

He referred me about an hour after we parted ways and I already have an interview lined up for tomorrow….

I care about him a lot (obviously) and my heart would love to jump at the opportunity to be able to see him everyday again. 

But my head knows what I need to do. I’m just sad. I might let him down, and he has no idea how I feel :( ",1,1757637478.0,unrequited_love,0,1.0,False
1nepcid,https://www.reddit.com/r/FindLoveWorldwide/comments/1nepcid/31_m_in_texas_looking_for_my_bonnie/,31 M in Texas looking for my Bonnie,"Howdy reddit,

Little about me:

I'm a professional that travels often all across the South and Midwest for both work and my personal hobbies. I'm engineer by training but these days I work in technical sales educating people on my companies product line. Typically I travel once a month to DFW and then each month I go out of state.

These days I have a pretty regimental fitness routine. Start each day with a 2 mile walk with a cup of coffee. Afternoons are resistance training and evenings I either go for a walk around the lake nearby my home or hit the shooting range.

I use to be an avid gamer but cut way back over the last 10 years to spend my free time more active and outdoors. When I lived in Washington state I was an avid backpacker and spent most of my weekends in the mountains of Olympic National Park. These days in Texas my primary outdoor activity is competitive shooting. I train often and compete nationally now.

Politically I am more moderate. I grew up conservative back in Alaska, but as I grow older I see both sides of the line. I tend to make political decisions with what makes common sense and also supports my values, which these days is pretty hard.

My top values are integrity, kindness, compassion, honesty, and determination.

When it comes to family / kids I knew awhile back that fatherhood was never for me and had a vasectomy.

Financially I am very stable and live debt free.

What am I looking for?

Someone who can relate to what I've written above. I am a highly independent and financially stable person that is looking to build a partnership with someone. I don't think life is meant to be experienced alone, its meant to be shared with someone. I'm fine with a long distance relationship since I am very open to moving. With my line of work, I can really be anywhere. Age is also not a factor for me, either younger or older.

1nepa87,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1nepa87/dae_else_get_huge_anxiety_during_arguing/,"DAE else get huge anxiety during arguing, especially post COVID?","M49, Just happened to me, maybe the 4th incident in 3 years. I think we can all agree good manners are a thing of the past. Sometimes in public , usually coffee shop or bus/train, as much as I tell myself “let it go, it’s not worth it”…..whenever I speak up against rude behaviour, boom! Heart pounds so hard it’s not funny, very scary for the next 10-15 minutes after I have spoken up

I had a nasty COVID infection 3 years back, I am finally much improved these last 12 months, no more beta blocker or Zoloft. But even so, before the pandemic, I don’t ever recall a conflict/argument causing my chest to pound like this- then again I’m not married ! . I usually play cards online, but one of the rare times I played at a casino, is the only other incidence , not so much the $$$ I stood to lose , but the eternal wait for the other guy’s decision made my chest pound 

What’s weird is I had just speed walked 3 miles to the coffee shop, exercise is no issue anymore, whereas two years ago just hopping off the couch my heart could go 160BPM due to POTS

Anyway, just seeing if arguing leads anyone else to have massive palpitations since their infection . I think I finally learned it is indeed better to just shut up, no matter how rude kids can be in public ",1,1757637283.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Bro, humanity is wild For decades, we’ve had UFO sightings weird signals and all kinds of mysterious stuff in space and no one cares. NASA is quietly sitting on it probably sipping coffee like “yeah, we see it.” But suddenly, someone notices a giant crab looking thing chilling on an orange rock on Mars and everyone loses their minds like it’s the second coming. People are screaming “IT’S JUST A ROCK!” while the crab literally has legs and is waving at them, and NASA refuses to investigate. Like how? Are we really this dumb or just allergic to obvious aliens? There's only 2 explanation 
1 they know 
2 they don't want to know

What I was trying to do was just get a little bit of perspective and a little bit of distance a little space right give her some give me some regroup and come back even stronger and that's not what happened but I love this person with all my heart soul I want nothing from her but her the best I want but I will take everything else in between I want the good the bad the ugly ups the downs the less the right I want all of it and I can't wait for nothing more than two hopefully one day be able to wake up jump out of bed run out to the kitchen and make you that cup of coffee even if you don't drink it anymore..

1nep52u,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1nep52u/the_pancake_house_apocalypse_guide/,The Pancake House Apocalypse Guide,"Driving down the mostly deserted street, I finished my cheap motel coffee, tasting the even cheaper whiskey, burning my throat and igniting a fire in my stomach.  I rounded a corner in the road and saw two of the most iconic signs known to people throughout the southeastern portion of the United States.  Two signs with black letters on yellow backgrounds filled the horizon “S E R G E A N T D O L L A R” and “P A N C A K E H O U S E.”  I parked my favorite shitbox vehicle in the spot next to the dumpsters on the side of the Pancake House and flicked the cigarette in the general direction of the trash can from my open window.  As I opened the door an empty beer can rolled out and tumbled across the pavement.  I sighed, bent over and picked it up, and tossed it into the dumpster before anyone could see.  The sun hadn’t quite made it over the horizon yet but was still too bright for my hung over eyes.  Blinking away a splitting headache, I noticed that the parking lot was empty, not even my manager’s car was parked by the back door.  I looked inside the diner and saw that the kitchen and dining room was empty.

“What the fuck?”  I said in confusion.

Then I heard some rustling by the dumpster and saw the scraggily head of Cain pop out from behind one of the dumpsters with scrambled eggs on his beard.  Cain was our resident crackhead that we allowed to kick it at the dumpster and occasionally fed him any extra food we had at the end of shifts in exchange for keeping away less savory crackheads.  He wasn’t the biggest guy around but you know what they say about the size of a dog in a fight.  Well it sure as hell fit Cain, he was a right bastard in a fight.

“Hey!”  I called out to Cain, “Where the hell is everybody?”

Cain turned and studied the diner, “I dunno.”  Then he bent over and picked up the beer can I had just tossed and tipped it back, tapping the bottom of the can draining it of the remnants of beer and saliva.

“Thanks for the help dick.”  I muttered before making my way inside the building and double checking that my car was locked.

As I walked from the back room towards the front the sounds and smells of a kitchen invaded my senses.  The smell of oil, bacon and coffee filled my nose and twinged my unsettled stomach.  My feet slid ever so slightly as a mix of dish water, mop water and grease covered the chipped tile floor.  The hanging lights over the bar were still lit and all the flat surfaces were clean and spotless.  There did appear to be a mess behind the counter where someone dropped a plate of food and just left it for me to clean.

“Fucking night shift.”  I muttered, grabbing a broom and mop.

I idly wondered where my coworkers were at and hoped I hadn’t missed something important.  I really wish I hadn’t dropped my phone in the toilet full of puke the night prior so I couldn’t even text or call anyone.  After cleaning the mess, I let my body go through the familiar task of setting up for the day while my mind entered a pseudo meditative state where I thought of leaving and moving on to the next small town like I had been doing for the past few years.

After about an hour, I finished all my opening duties and the duties of my still missing coworkers and really began to think that something was off.  Cain was usually one of the first people I saw everyday but he’s never been the only person I saw.  Come to think of it, I didn’t even see any cars on the small but (comparatively) highly trafficked road to the interstate right outside of the small town.  I went outside for a cigarette and I could definitely see tons of cars moving slowly down the interstate which made me feel a little better.  

“Maybe there was a bad accident and that’s caused everyone to be late.”  I said to myself knowing full well at least Alice, my manager, lived not too far from the motel I stayed at in town.  

I made my way back inside and set to cooking myself some breakfast, seeing as no one was around to stop me or judge my voracious appetite.  Apparently, I wasn’t the only one that had this idea, as I had just plated myself a “Texas Pancake Melt” and double chunked, peppered and covered hashbrowns when Cain walked in, hesitantly looking around.  

Sighing, I said, “It’s alright Cain, c’mon in.  Want pancakes?”

He nodded and took a seat at the bar while I set about fixing him pancakes and filled a fresh pot of coffee for the two of us.  We didn’t usually let Cain inside or near the entrance during busy hours as he would harass exiting patrons for change and lick his lips at pigeons that lined the roof of our building.  The last time Cain had come in, he had blatantly taken half eaten food off of people’s plates and, in one case, took a french fry from a child’s hand.  Before long however, we were sharing a meal together in only slightly uncomfortable silence staring at the cracked brown tile and pictures of the original “Pancake House” and owner.

“Soo, ya’like cooking boy?”  He said in his raspy (Scottish?) accent.

“It’s not the worst job I’ve had, certainly not the hardest or easiest but I never go hungry.”  I winced, looking at the frail frame of Cain but he didn’t seem to take offence to the faux pas.

“Had many jobs?”  He asked.

“I suppose,  been around and worked around.  I was in college then moved to oil work, pipe laying, circus clown here and a ranch hand there.”  

Cain nodded his head and raised his eyebrows in appreciation.

“Have- you had many jobs?”  I asked, stumbling not sure how to ask or if to ask the question.

“Nope.”  He said simply. “I’ve fought for, been fucked for or stole everything I’ve ever had.”

Coffee shot into my nose at his casualness of that statement and Cain laughed at my discomfort.

“But, like you said, this gig ain’t too bad for me neither.  I fight for my dumpster and I get the occasional full pancake and hot cup of coffee.”  He said with a pleased smile that showed off all three teeth.

“Well, where do you think everyone is at?”  I asked, blatantly changing the topic

“Like I said earlier lad, I haven’t got the foggiest of fucking clues.  It’s not like I've got a phone or nuffin.  But, I did hear quite the fucking racket when all those stars fell from the sky but that was after I shot up so that’s a wash if it was real or not.”

I searched my foggy memory of last night trying to think of any ‘stars falling’ but all I could remember was a pretty caramel face, brown curls and an unearthly color growing from the depths that made me feel nauseous when I thought of it.

“I don’t know,”  I said eventually. “I was plastered last night so I can’t exactly prove you wrong.”

We continued the rest of our meal in silence until Cain stood up from his stool.  “Well thank you for sharing a meal with me Mick, makes me feel like a man again but I got a couple of chores to do around the ole’ abode.”

“Uh yeah, no problem Cain.  Guess I’ll see you later.”  I said thinking of what kind of chores a crackhead has to do in a dumpster.

For the rest of the shift, not a single soul got off the interstate.  No one entered the diner, the Sergeant Dollar behind the diner or the gas station across the street.  I noticed on one of my smoke breaks that neither store appeared to be open.  That made me anxious as I was running low on cigs and the Sergeant Dollar was the only place that got frequent shipments of “Reds” and I was running through my own supply rapidly with my boredom driven cravings.  When I came back into the diner from that smoke break, there was an old box television and vcr on a cart in the middle of the kitchen.

“Now what the fuck is this?”  I asked to the empty room.

I once again explored the diner and found no one inside and double checked the parking lot for a car and only saw my red shitbox.  I went back inside and checked out the anomalous cart and found on top of the vcr was a vhs tape labelled, “The Pancake House Apocalypse Guide.”  With growing confusion, I rolled the cart to the back office and plugged the ancient technology into an outlet and played the vhs tape, reminding me of when I was a kid at my grandparents’ house watching old westerns.  The screen flickered green for a moment and went through the customary legal disclaimers and then the Pancake House company logo and my heart dropped, fearing a training video filled with monotone monologues and washed up 90s sitcom actors.  The screen flicked to a still photo of the exterior of a Pancake House and a tinny pompous male voice came out of the speakers. 

“Congratulations, Loyal Employee of the Pancake House corporation!  You have been selected to be a part of an elite cooking team to happily serve the weary survivors in the coming apocalypse!”

“What the fuck.”  I said for the third (fourth?) time today.

“As you know Pancake House has held a long tradition to stay open 24/7 365 days a year rain or shine in as many locations as possible.  In the past, we have implemented Jump Teams to aid areas under natural disasters, well that has evolved into Star Teams because you sir are a star!”  

I idly thought about the likelihood of this being some elaborate prank by my coworkers before considering the amount of effort it would take to record a video on a vhs tape in the late 2020s.  I could see in my mind a poor intern being told by an ancient exec to record a training video using technology that predated their own conception.

“In these unprecedented times, we ask you, the best of our very best, to serve your company to the best of your abilities and we will provide you with everything that you shall need.  The rest of this guide shall guide you through the apocalypse with ease and shall become your new holy doctrine.”

I rolled my eyes at hearing the cheery voice utter “unprecedented,” I was so tired of hearing that fucking word.  It seemed like at every turn in my life there was another “unprecedented” event that would “irrevocably” change the world.  Y2k, 9/11, 2008 housing crash, 2012 the false apocalypse and Covid-19 of the 2020s.  To my generation, none of these really made any difference in our lives as we were either too young to understand or too poor for a financial crisis to affect our ramen noodle diet.

“Your location had been deemed an ideal spot for weary survivors to stop by to rest and strengthen their will to continue on their travels through the coming storm and as such, it is your responsibility to maintain the store with dignity, grace and courtesy.  For when the dark days come to an end, you shall be rewarded greatly for your efforts and be heralded as a hero!”  Cheered the voice as clearly computer generated vignettes of cooks and servers served Mad Max extras complete with explosions filling the windows.  “You are to complete weekly training via these informational videos which are going to be vital not only to your survival, but also providing excellent customer service! You will receive periodic shipments of supplies to insure that our customers get only the best we can provide them during these trying times of hardship.  Be sure that you don’t take more than what you need, otherwise you will be terminated…”

“I wonder what their definition of ‘terminated’ means during the apocalypse.”  I thought to myself before the video changed to a scene where an obese employee was gorging himself on bacon and pancakes, a gaunt family looked sadly at him through the window.  It wasn’t long before he was shot in the back of the head, spewing blood, brain matter and bone fragments across the table and window to the delight of the young children watching him.  The camera panned over to the shooter, revealing a suspiciously buff guy in a manager’s apron with an uncanny smile on his face before he holstered the strange pistol and pulled out a rag and broom.

“Alrighty then.”  

“Being as your craven coworkers have abandoned their sacred posts to be with their FaMiLiEs.”  The voice said with venom and sarcasm.  “You are charged with being the sole defender of your new holy land, as such, we expect you to not leave your post for longer than the standard one hour per eight hours for your lunch break.”  It said, mimicking a certain popular mouse’s laugh at the end.

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me, this can’t be real.”  I said incredulously.  “What do you expect me to do?  Sleep here in the back room?!”  This was all far too “Bethesda.”

“Haha! Yes!”  It said, seemingly in response to my question before continuing.  “This may seem ridiculous at first, but rest assured that we are entirely serious, as proof we have provided your first adjusted check in the vhs case.  Please open the envelope now.”  

Obeying the questionably sentient vhs tape, I picked up the case for the vhs tape and sure enough, there was an envelope that I hadn’t seen when I pulled the tape out.  I took my car keys out of my pocket and opened the envelope carefully at first until the paper just started ripping down the middle and I gave up all pretense of care and tore it the rest of the way open like a neanderthal.  Pulling the check out of the massacred envelope, I read the five digit sum after the supposed nonexistent government had taken its “share” and my mouth opened and closed like a gasping fish.

“Quite the sum eh?”  Asked the voice cheekily.  “Well fear not, you will be fairly compensated to make yourself a comfortable man for whatever civilization rises from the ashes of the previous.  This shall conclude your introductory training course for this week, please flip the tape over to the other side and play me in one week's time or if you are ever in desperate times.  Remember, duty and grace!”  It said before the screen went black.

I contemplated leaving right then and there to deposit the huge sum and getting out of Dodge myself.  Then I realized I could just mobile deposit the check with my phone.  Then, as I was reaching for my pocket, I remembered the fallen soldier, drowned in puke and water that I had laid to rest in a bag of rice in hopes of a miraculous resurrection.  Then I shook my head and decided that I would go on about my day as normal and ride around town to see if I could find anyone around.

A few hours passed and I occasionally checked the stinky fried phone and eventually gave up on it before tossing it, still in the bag, in a drawer of Alice's desk.  By then, my relief, George, should have arrived but there was no sign of him nor anyone else for that matter.

“Well there’s nothing else for it I guess.”  I said to the empty room.

I briefly thought about trying to lock the doors to the building but realized I had never seen any such key for the doors let alone possess one as the diner was supposed to be open 24 hours a day.  

“I’m leaving now!” I shouted, into the void that was the diner. 

“It’s no longer my fault if someone doesn’t come to their own shift!”  I waited for a response, nothing came. 

“Goodnight!”  I said before leaving the building.

Before I got into my car, I heard a strange sound almost like a trumpet or train horn emit a single long tone before ceasing.  I hadn’t recalled being able to hear the train from this side of town but it was the only thing I could think of.  I drove down the still empty two lane road headed back towards town, I kept glancing at my rearview mirror, watching the unmoving line of cars on the overpass.  I couldn’t make out any forms in the vehicles.  What I did see were enormous black clouds rolling fast from the east and the strong wind that buffeted the trees.  I saw dogs and cats either roaming the empty roads or sitting in the driveways, waiting on something or someone.  Something else was bothering me and I couldn’t place it until I got to the first red light and the light was out, it was then that I realized that I hadn’t seen any other sign of artificial light since I left the Pancake House. The intersection was empty save for me so I just went on by.  The storm was rolling in fast now and the light of the sun was dimming to a drab gray, usually the street lights would have turned on by now, but they seemed to be on the fritz as well.  I idly wondered at how early we lost power seeing as the storm hadn’t even really gotten to the small town, but yet there wasn’t a single light in town that I could see.  I pulled into the local bank to cash out half the check and deposit the rest but the parking lot was empty and the lights were off as well.  

“Where the fuck is everybody at?”  I wondered, thinking I might have missed an evacuation order from last night.

Figuring there was nothing for it, I headed back to my humble abode that was my motel room on the same road the Pancake House was on.  It was on the seedier side of town and there was at least one form of degenerate hanging around the busy corner with a sign or hiked up skirt but not even the local homeless seemed to be home.  

As I was pulling into the parking lot of the motel, it started coming down the rain blistering the air as it was shot down by the storm, it felt like I was in an enormous car wash.

“Of course it starts raining right when I’m about to get out of the car.”  I mumbled unhappily.

I thought that would be the worst of it as the rain stung my skin as I ran to the safety of my door but halfway there, I started hearing wet and heavy splotching sounds all around me like paper bags filled with jello falling to the floor.  One such splotch landed directly in front of me and I saw that it was a fat frog.  The sudden arrival of the concrete sidewalk in the middle of its terminal velocity flight appeared to have bested the poor creature, one webbed foot attached to a fat leg twitched in the air.  

“Jesus fucking Christ!”  I yelled as more splotches hit the ground and a shock of lightning struck in the distance marking my profane vulgarity.

I spared no time trying to guess how the frogs were yeeted at such speeds, instead, doubling my efforts at reaching the safety of my room.  I threw open the door to the shitty room and slammed it shut against the howling wind and nightmare inducing “splotching.”  I opened the curtains to the big pane glass window that looked over the parking lot and I saw the hundreds of little green bodies scattered throughout the area, their blood mixing into the rain water making a brown slurry of foul and would surely smell like hell once the storm passed.

“What in the hell is going on?”  I thought, the sight of it all making me speechless.

I desperately tried to rationalize the situation, I was bordering the south and was sort of nearish to several bodies of water.  Hadn’t I heard of water spouts or tornadoes launching frogs and fish into the sky before?  If that was the case, there was surely going to be a lot of very happy birds and some pissed off DNR guy wondering where all his wildlife had been raptured to.  Something in my gut told me this wasn’t so mundane as a freak act of nature but my devoutly agnostic mind refused to give in and willfully chose to ignore this in favor of getting blitzed out of my gourd.

I turned to the pig sty of a room “Past Mick” had left for “Future Mick” to deal with knowing full well that neither would have to deal with the mess as “Present Mick” would, like always, be left with the shit end of the stick that neither of the other versions of myself seemed to end up with.  

“Where has my weed gone.”  I said in a goblin like tone, searching through all the nooks and crannies of the nest.

I eventually found my grinder and half a joint next to a thoroughly gunked pipe, so, lighting the joint I methodically cleaned the pipe and filled it back up with the rest of my precious herbs.  This specific strain was called “Forbidden Fruit,” which obviously made it sound like it would be “fruity” but just ended up tasting like every other weed strain I had tried.  The shit was REALLY good on the other hand and before I had even lit up the pipe, I was well on my way of completing my quest of becoming blitzed.   That’s when I heard a strange noise coming from the exterior door, well a different strange noise other than the rhythmic splotching of frog bodies bombarding the small town.  It was a sort of “thump-flisch-pause-thump-flisch” which intrigued my weed addled mind to no end.

In what I thought was an excellent Sherlock Holmes impression, I said.  “I must find out what is making that strange noise I do say!” before giggling to myself.

The journey to the door was long but I eventually made it and opened the door to reveal no one.  Then something hit my leg and I nearly jumped out of my skin as my gaze landed on an enormous Bull Frog.  I screamed like a little girl and jumped back into the threshold of my sanctuary.

“Hey calm it down won’chya?”  Said the Frog in a (Boston?) accent.

This of course sent me into another tizzy and it was official, my vibe was thoroughly harshed.

“I said calm down, not cry like a sissy.  Now what’s a guy gotta do to get some good grub in this joint, eh?”  Asked the ridiculous little creature.

“What?”  I began to ask as I peered over the sideways couch that had been overturned in my full blown retreat from the invader.

“Nevermind, I can see the buffet you’ve laid out so helpfully.”  He said before bounding into the little kitchen area where there were indeed a hoard of flies circling the overflowing trash can.

The large frog was like a mix between an anti air gun from the WWII documentaries I used to watch in college and a cowboy with his magic lasso that caught everything it was thrown at.   Within minutes, the Bull Frog had wiped out the generations of flies that had built up over the past months.

“Much obliged Mick, you are indeed a kind host if I do say so myself.”  The frog said as he made his way back over to me, hopping from one piece of furniture to another.

“Th-thank you?” I stammered.  “What are you doing here  Mr.-”

“Frank, Frank the Fucking Frog at your service but you can just call me Fank for short.”  He said, finishing my sentence and bowing at his full name.

“Well, Frank, what uh what seems to bring you to my humble abode.”  I squeaked.

“Oh I’m your trip sitter bro, and after you sober up you gotta get back to the Pancake House.”

“Wait what?”  I asked incredulously.

“You gotta get back to work numbfuck.  Don’t you remember that weird ass vhs tape?”

“How did-”  I began as my slow brain was warped and twisted, starting a thousand questions and finishing none.

“You -uhh doin alright kid?”  Asked Frank.  

I realized that I had just been standing there mouth a gape like a fish gasping at thick oxygen.  “Uh yeah, totally.  I’m chill, I'm chill.”  I said, totally not chill.

I righted the furniture that I had knocked over and gathered the pipe that had miraculously not lost its cargo in the commotion.  We sat there in silence for a while, I looked out the window at the storm while we puff puff passed.  Rain came down like a shower from the heavens washing the world’s sins down the storm drains to join filth we flush out of our houses.  The storm was picking up again, wind was violently whipping trees, trash cans were rolling down the streets and I even saw a trampoline fly over one of the houses.

“I gotta admit, you’re handling this a lot better than I thought you was going to.”  Said Frank after a while.

“What?”  I asked, jolting slightly as the sudden interruption.

“God you aren’t the quickest one are you?”  He replied.  “Listen, you really gotta get back to your work as soon as you can.  They’ll let this first instance go by without punishment but if you stay out too long, they’ll-”

“What do you mean?  Who’s they?”  I asked, interrupting him.

“For the love of God and all that is holy I’m trying to explain that to you you feckless fuck.”  He said sharply and turning a hairy (slimy? scaly?) eye on me.

“I’m sorry, I’m just having a little trouble taking all this in seeing as you’re a fucking talking frog!  Now please enlighten me, shitty Kermit.”  I said hawtily.

Frank seemed to take a breath to calm himself.  “Pancake House needs you to do your job and to not leave the diner except on your OSHA mandated breaks, otherwise you are not going to like what they do to you.”

“Why the fuck do they care about OSHA?”  I asked.

“HO-LY SHIT.  Listen to me asswipe!”  He practically screamed.  “Go, stay I don’t give a fuck.  I’m outta here, I held up my end of the bargain.”  He said before storming to the door and jumping on the doorhandle, which allowed the door to swing open from the wind.  

I sprung to my feet and fought to close the door and when I eventually did, I looked around and out the window but Frank was nowhere to be seen and I was no longer high.

I looked around the dark room again and sighed to myself.

“At least the Pancake House has power.”  I thought, “I could at least ride out the storm there until the power comes back on in town using the back up generators.”

So, I gathered up my meager belongings and braved the storm once again, dodging frogs as best I could.  In case you're wondering, driving down a road slick with frog bodies is not pleasant to say the least but I was soon pulling into the Pancake House Parking lot for the second time that day.  There wasn’t any sign of Cain outside and assumingly went inside to at least get out of the rain. 

Cain was indeed in the dining area, drinking a cup of coffee and he had guests.  He was seated at one of the booths playing cards with a family of raccoons?

“Hey Mick.”  Said Cain distractedly.

I wasn’t entirely sure if anything I was experiencing recently was even real so I decided to not engage with the odd scene and instead made my way to the back.  To my surprise, there was a freshly made cot large enough for me to sleep on more or less comfortably.

“I guess this is home for now.”  I said, setting my belongings in the office and arranging the bedding.

I lay there staring at the ceiling and listening to the low hums of different electrical kitchen equipment as they lay dormant.  I decided to pull out the laptop I once used to write notes in American History and typed out the events of the day.

The next thing I knew I was ensorcelled by brown hair and a girlish laugh, wholly taken in with their sweet promise.  An alien light grew from behind her, silhouetting her figure, masking her features, consuming her and all that was, is and will be.  The horn blew.",2,1757636862.0,writers,3,0.75,False

For 2 years now, I work a buffet attendant for a breakfast buffet inside a hotel. It's not very big. I used to make good money and my hourly is $23 plus gratuity and sometimes cash tips. 

Last year they hired this older lady. From the very beginning she didn't want my help, didnt want me to train her, 'she knew'. Little by little she tried to change everything on the buffet the way I place it. She kept acting friendly towards me and yet she was complaining to management that I don't do as much as her and even went ahead to accuse me for sexual harassment. A bunch of male employees were talking ro me and she was trying ro say that I am trying to hook her up. She started crying and I ended up getting a write up. Old management is gone and new people came in, thank goodness. 

They hired a new employee a few months ago. (The other employee quit, he was working there 2 days)
The older lady employee influenced the new employee by telling him she is the manager and how he should quit his other job because we make a lot if money here. He ended up quitting his old job and he demanded full-time. So I was kicked off the 5 days working only 4, which I am fine with. I saw what they did, they take credit that they work hard and clean and say I don't. But the new employee is always late, even an hour late because he overslept and he keeps asking me to cover his other day, so what was the point?

On top of that, they both don't like how I set things. The sanitizer bucket water was not very hot and the old lady snapped at me saying that she wants it very hot and if I have a problem I can physically fight her. The new employee guy tries to micromanage me and let's say I put certain pastries out, he will go after me and change the pastries and put the ones he wants. On top of that he pockets tips. He tries to take all of the coffee orders and guests pay using cash and they tell him to keep the change. He doesn't ring up rhe orders and pockets the whole bill. It's something I reported to management and is under investigation.

On the other hand, both of these employees are so nosy. They ask about my trips and I am currently in college and want to know what I do.

I find all of this so disgusting and territorial. Other employees who worked with me in the past were fine, no trying to order around or act that way.",3,1757636414.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

1neovud,https://i.redd.it/1zfywaqkmmof1.jpeg,I think I made a mistake in my analysis 😅 and this made it worse xd,"how to start so that it sounds so controversial 🤔 I think I have to teach you why I accused Akane's family in the first place and also because I had been confused that Akane's mother is a minister if she is not a former minister which makes the situation more questionable when we remember that Akane's mother brought the foreign princess how could she hide her from the local and national government so that they would not notice and also that if they found out it would cause a diplomatic disaster for Japan and that kingdom which in the situation is at an elite level something that Akane's mother was able to solve without there being suspicions and that is the murky thing how many people did she move to bring the foreign princess

In this situation, Akane's mother talks a lot about the government and its power. To be honest, I'm not surprised that our first impression of the Akane family was that Hayato was kidnapped for no reason, just because Akane's grandmother wanted to see him.

And now I will show you why I accused the Akane family so that you understand me and how I do my analysis about it.

In this situation where Hayato was losing his house, we understand that the other families of Kiku, Oukay Riho do not have political power and resources to help Hayato in this situation, there is only Ami's family and Akane's family.

Also, I started noticing the parents or powerful people in each family, so I ruled them out because they couldn't help Hayato in the situation, as he mentioned last time. Like Ouka, Riho, and Kiku, their parents don't have political power, so defending Hayato rules them out, putting their families at risk. This is why I chose the mayor, who is Eri's partner, Ami's sister, and Akane's mother. Both have influence, but the mayor is less influential in this regard.

And here I made a comparison of each family and their actions in the manga and how they helped in each girl's relationship with Hayato so you know I'm neutral in this.

Ami's family

support for hayato

Eri's partner (the mayor) opposes the hotel project.
- Family gives blessing to Ami-Hayato's relationship.
- They agree to Ami living in that home for the future.
- They take political risks to defend the land.

There was never anything suspicious in that family, although Ami's grandmother had her promise not to interfere with Hayato. The mayor helped Hayato in everything, until he lost his job as mayor, and even then he warned Hayato to stay in a safe place.

Akane's family

Well, I think we all know Akane's family didn't help Hayato on any of the other occasions. There's no proof in the manga that they show their support for Hayato.

Here are the accusations in order

Secret alliance with Fuwa and even an attempted arranged marriage.
- A mother with diplomatic power never stopped the project.
- A family with resources, but never defended the coffee.
- Illegal/shady dealings (secret princess)

And besides, Akane's grandmother had the same promise with Hayato not to interfere, but they really took it seriously and did nothing.

And here we saw the support of each family and also if I missed something let me know, it's too much information in a short time.

But let's get serious about the question: every grandmother of every girl except Akane congratulated Sachiko on her marriage, and Masahiro instead challenged Hayato with a katana.

Furthermore, all the grandmothers despised Fuwa and never related to him, blaming him for the fire at the original family café, and Akane's family, 25 years ago, started relating to Fuwa. Seriously, how do they find justification for this? Besides, no one knows about this relationship with Fuwa, only Akane's mother and grandmother.

And I also think I'm going to make a second part about the possible futures to save the cafe and Hayato's house and then we'll see the winner.

I was good tho for the most part (i’ll get to that later), after setting the gas on i stocked everything from a storage unit and logged it to keep track, brought over a few gallons of water for the day etc it was all ready before 11:30 (official opening time) so i was happy i managed to do it before we started serving bc i was worried i’d fail. 

Anyway during the day it had been quite slow and there are some things we were low on prior days and had to request supplies brought over, the OWNER OF THE COMPANY COMES and as he fucking arrives he saw me on my phone (we had no customers at all and everything was clean) and leaning against a counter, gave me a bollocking for it and rightly so ofc as i shouldn’t of tbf, i apologized profusely as i hate like being a burden or annoying or failing to do smth anyway he says it’s fine just if i wanna go on my phone go outside or smth which i’m alright with, i asked my manager for the owners number to apolgize again (he wouldn’t give it and said i apologized more than enough) i disagree) and the Owner told the manager hes sorry he was “already in a bad mood and took it out on D…” I didn’t think he was in the wrong for how he spoke to me i fully understood and accepted it ofc but i still feel like a knob for it, if i see him again i’m gna apologize again. i am genuinely just praying he doesn’t dislike me or hate me or smth. 

Anyway i’m doing another open alone today (friday) so i’m gna go to bed in like an hour then repeat the process except correct hopefully. 

Was also on the grill all day today and cooked some *insane* burgers and got free doughnuts and coffee for it so that’s a small win",0,1757635909.0,Vent,1,0.5,False
1neosjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Klance/comments/1neosjg/looking_for_klance_fics/,looking for klance fics!!  ‼️🗣,"Fic 1. My memory is kinda foggy but I think the plot was basically : Keith works at a coffee shop and lance works at a animal shelter or something similar, Keith kinda hates his job? I think lance was convinced to work at the animal shelter because of Allura, he was originally gonna ask her out but then she started talking about like abused animals and he got all emotional and volunteered to work there??? Pretty sure hunk PIDGE and Shiro are there too. I also remember a chapter included karaoke and lance could sing. I think near the end lance does something and it like breaks Keith's heart or something but i think its lance who apologizes and they get together and open a new coffee shop together PLEASE I know that's a terrible description but I hope it rings a bell

Fic 2. ( tw - suicide mentioned) This time lance works at a coffee shop, Keith has a massive crush on him but tragically lance gets hit by a car and dies and instead of like, life continuing like regular, he gets stuck in a time loop repeating that day over and over trying to save lance, but he keeps dying in different ways, turns out lance is sucidal and is actually killing HIMSELF so on one of the loops Keith just comes clean and confesses his crush and tells lance he doesn't know what he would do if something happened to him (or something along those lines) lance doesn't kill himself and they live happily ever after!! Or something like that 😭

my boyfriend and i have been together for 13 months now, we have lived together for the duration of our relationship because i got kicked out of home and needed a place to stay and was unable to get my own place. we live with his family and both pay rent. 

i have struggled with my mental health since i was younger and he is well aware of the trauma i have been through. i am diagnosed with depression and CPTSD and in therapy for both. 

i also have diagnosed endometriosis, which impacts my cycle, hormones and physical symptoms that come with it. 

this morning i had classes to attend because i’m studying my healthcare course right now, i had really bad period cramps when i woke up and took painkillers but they didn’t work. i was in tears explaining to my boyfriend i couldn’t go today i was in too much pain. 

he explained to me i still had to go, and drove me to my campus and dropped me off there, and said i can’t come home until afterwards. he said he feels like i was mad at him and he felt like “he was walking on eggshells around me”. which with the hormonal mess that’s going on in my brain made me burst into tears. i left and now i’m sitting at a coffee shop trying not to cry as i’m writing this. i feel like my mental health has really taken a toll on him and i feel so guilty about it. 

how do i explain to him how i’m feeling? because i have explained to him countless times everything that’s going on with me and how i feel but i don’t think he understands how much it impacts my day to day life. it’s hard to get out of bed, let alone hold down a job and attend classes as well.

1neonqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1neonqm/solo_48_hours_in_november/,Solo 48 hours in November,"Hello!

My birthday is November 22 and I took Gaga having a concert that day as a sign and booked myself a quick 48 hours in Paris. I get in early on the 21 and leave midday on the 23.  I’ll be staying at the Marriott Courtyard Gare de Lyon, so it’s convenient to the Accor Arena, but while it’s not my first time in a Paris, it’s my first time solo and staying in this area. 

I do want to check and make sure it’s a safe-ish area for a solo female traveler. I do imagine with the concerts, I won’t exactly be alone on the streets, but want to cover my bases. 

I also have a few things I truly love in this world—food, books, coffee, and wine. Are there any good spots to eat that have decent bar seating/aren’t weird to be at as a solo diner? I do feel comfortable with the metro to travel for something good. 

Coffee-wise, I admittedly tend to go for the American stereotypes of a drip coffee or a flavored latte, but also will go out of my way for a great Americano.

I do plan to spend a good chunk of time in the Notre Dame area and browsing Shakespeare and Co, so suggestions for there or the area in-between are very welcome. 

On one hand, I feel so happy for myself that I get to experience this for my birthday, but on the other, there’s something that bums me out a little doing it on my own, so I do want to try and make it feel as special as possible. ",1,1757635467.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False
1neon5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Habits/comments/1neon5y/i_applied_30_days_of_boredom_and_it_completely/,I applied 30 days of boredom and it completely changed my life,"I was addicted to distraction. Phone while eating, podcast while walking, Netflix while cooking. I hadn't been alone with my thoughts in probably 5 years.

The moment silence hit, I'd panic and reach for something anything to fill the void.

Then I stumbled across research showing that our brains literally need boredom to function properly. Creative insights, problem-solving, even basic self-awareness all happen during mental downtime.

So I made myself a deal: 30 days of deliberately seeking boredom.

What I actually did:

* Morning coffee with zero input. Just me, coffee, and whatever thoughts showed up. No scrolling, no news, no podcasts.
* Walks without headphones. 15 minutes daily of just walking. And thinking. Or not thinking.
* Meals as meals. Food and silence. That's it. Absolutely brutal at first.
* Bathroom breaks stayed bathroom breaks. No more scrolling on the toilet. Just sitting there and doing nothing.
* 5-minute wait rule. Before grabbing my phone when bored, I'd wait 5 minutes and see what happened. Most of the times I didn't scroll at it.

Day 3: I almost quit

My brain felt like it was vibrating. I was anxious, irritable, couldn't focus. I kept reaching for my phone and finding nothing there. It was like digital withdrawal.

Day 8: Something shifted

During my boring walk, I randomly remembered this song my dad used to play when I was a kid. Then I started thinking about calling him. Then I actually did call him. Best conversation we'd had in months.

That's when I realized my brain had been too cluttered to access my own memories.

Day 12: The idea came

I solved a work problem that had been driving me crazy for weeks. Just out of nowhere while washing dishes in silence. Then I got an idea for a side project. Then another one. I realized solutions come to us when we let our brains rest.

It was like my brain had been waiting for permission to think.

Day 18: I looked forward to being bored

This was the weirdest part. I started craving those quiet moments. My morning coffee ritual became sacred. The silent walks felt like therapy. I was happy to be alone and peaceful.

Day 25: Everything felt different

Colors seemed brighter. Food tasted better. Conversations were deeper because I was actually present instead of thinking about what to check on my phone next.

What actually changed:

* I remembered who I was. Turns out I have opinions, preferences, and ideas that aren't influenced by whatever algorithm I'd been feeding my brain.
* My sleep improved dramatically. When your mind isn't constantly stimulated, it actually knows how to rest. Who knew?
* I became a better friend. Really listening to people instead of waiting for my turn to talk changed everything. Friends started coming to me with real problems, not just surface-level chat.
* Work became easier. Problems that used to stress me out suddenly had obvious solutions. My brain had space to actually process things.
* I got genuinely excited about stuff again. When you're not constantly consuming content, small things become interesting. I spent 20 minutes watching birds the other day and loved every second.

30 days later:

* I still use my phone, but it doesn't use me. I still watch Netflix, but I also stare at walls sometimes. And those wall-staring sessions often end up being the best part of my day.
* The person I was avoiding with all that distraction turned out to be someone worth knowing.
* Try eating one meal today without any entertainment. Just you and your food. See what shows up in your head.

Your brain is way more interesting than your phone.",7,1757635421.0,Habits,4,0.82,False

Maison Crivelli - Hibiscus Mahajad (this is a new one for me, it’s a sweet floral with eternal longevity)

Electimuss - Pomona Vitalis (LOVE this one. Geranium leaf, rose, lychee, strawberry, apple, vanilla. I don’t even know what genre this is. And being an extrait, the longevity is amazing)

Frapin - Speakeasy (a mutual fragrance, smells like an old leather chair drenched in booze in a bar after closing)

Penhaligon’s - Eau the Audacity (one of his favourites, it’s an incense vanilla and leather fragrance along the lines of Babycat - same perfumer - but more leathery and smooth. Same perfumer - Dominique Ropion)
 
Diptyque - L’Eau (this is a mutual favourite, I had to get this from France as it isn’t available in Australia at all. If you are familiar with Big Red gum - this is as close as I’ve ever smelled to it)

Korres - Kyma (we both love this, but it is probably his most used of any of my collection. It’s such a fantastic one, an aquatic fruity freshie with a pinch of nutmeg)

Awake - Akro (the most realistic coffee scent I have ever tried)

Marc Antoine-Barrois - Ganymede (melancholic stranded astronaut vibe)

Diptyque - Eau Duelle EDP (another of my husbands favourites, an aromatic vanilla)

Aurora Scents - Deciduous Summer (a soft fruity floral, this is another Dominique Ropion creation)

Goldfield & Banks - Sunset Hour, Ingenious Ginger, Pacific Rock Moss, Bohemian Lime (I love all except Bohemian Lime, and he loves all except Sunset Hour)

Brazil is the world’s biggest producer of higher-end arabica coffee and historically supplied about a third of the beans consumed in the US. 

Coffee shipments from Brazil into the US have halved in the year to date, according to Vizion, a shipping data service. The decline accelerated in August, when the coffee exports from Brazil were down more than 75 per cent from August 2024.

(We have separate bedrooms) I have had a male partner for 20 yrs+. She gets increasing jealous over me, especially when I'm with my BF or kids. Last week I went to my Daughters to go bingo and my fella went to play PlayStation with her BF, we got bk to my Daughters and had a few coffees and I had a shower, got a txt off (sister) aka where was I. Got no she was sat on her bed and I said hello and we was bk, IGNORED!! She screamed at me me asking why I had brought that 'useless ballbag' with me and then decided to square upto my partner and when he wouldn't take her on she (VERY DRUNK) SWUNG at my me twice after me asking her 10+ times to leave my bedroom, I'm ashamed to say I punched her in the face. She left soon after to go bk to her mouldy ridden nasty flat. That was last Saturday, she apologised on Tuesday and said she could stay as long as we put proper rules down. My BF laughed at her apology as it's not the first time shes done this... ×15!! Her flat is a hell hole, the landlord won't do anything about it and I feel bad if I have to to put her bk in that situation. What do you all think?

I discovered I was greyromantic about a month ago. All throughout my life, I’d only ever had 2 “crushes”, and none in high school. I don’t know if it was because the people around me did or what, but when I decided towards the end of middle school that I wasn’t going to date anyone until after high school (didn’t want to have to deal with the drama), suddenly I never had another crush, despite my graduating class of almost 500 people.

Now I’m at the end of my third week of college (fourth if you count the orientation week), and during the orientation week, I met a pretty cute girl, and we happened to have similar interests. Now I’m struggling, because I don’t know if I want to get to know her just as a friend or if I have a crush on her. But I know for sure I want to hang out with her more.

How do I ask her to hang out? I feel like it would be awkward to ask her to join my D&D group, since it’s a bunch of guys, and we’ve all known each other for a few years now. Do I just ask if she wants to get coffee sometime? I don’t drink even drink coffee. If this actually is a crush, then it’s going to be my first real relationship, and I don’t want to mess it up immediately.",1,1757634741.0,dating_advice,1,0.67,False

I’ve been on Letrozole with Ovidrel trigger, and now this round I’m taking Follistim injection.  When I talked to my RE she said I could have a drink (not get drunk but have the occasional drink).  However I’m nervous to do so incase it messes things up for any reason.  This cycle has been super delayed and am using Follistim to get my follicles a jump start.  So I’m thinking I won’t drink until I’ve ovulated.  But I’m wondering in general during each of your cycles if you have drank during them and if it’s made any difference?

# Notes

* Because my hips are so stiff and I slouch over my keyboard and phone all day, Mobility/Posture work is built into every day (face pulls, planks, wall angels, pec stretches, etc.).
* I rotate rest days as needed (sometimes swap in a long hike instead).
* Goal = shred while keeping muscle.



# What I've been eating

# Breakfasts (Most Days)

* 4 eggs (usually 1–2 whole, rest whites)
* Whole grain toast (1–2 slices)
* Half or whole avocado
* Handful of blueberries
* Occasionally: protein yogurt (15g protein) or breakfast burrito (eggs, potatoes, chilis, some cheese)

**Macros trend:** \~30–40g protein, 20–30g carbs, 10–15g fat



# Lunches

* Grilled chicken breast + broccoli + red potatoes
* Turkey + veggie stir fry (onions, peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, etc.) with rice (\~1–1.5 cups)
* Leftover salmon filet + wild rice + mushrooms
* Post-workout whey shake (2 scoops, \~40–50g protein) almost daily

**Macros trend:** \~50–60g protein, 40–60g carbs, 10–15g fat

  
**Dinners**

* Grilled flank steak hoagie (tomato, onion, spicy avocado sauce, cheddar)
* Salmon filet + broccoli + potatoes
* Turkey/veggie stir fry with rice (repeat)
* Chicken breast + grilled zucchini + roasted potatoes
* Flank steak / lean beef variation (protein + carb + veg template most nights)

**Macros trend:** \~40–55g protein, 30–50g carbs, 15–20g fat  


# Snacks & Add-Ons

* Double scoop whey (post-workout)
* Occasional Greek yogurt or protein yogurt cup
* Mushrooms (lions mane, grilled/sauteed — more for micronutrients + variety)
* Granola bars (on hike)
* Blueberries, handful here and there



# Drinks & Extras

* Water consistently
* Coffee/tea (daily)
* Alcohol:
   * 2 glasses red wine (Fri)
   * 1 glass Pinot Grigio (Sun with salmon)
   * 3 total drinks per week avg. 



# Overall Macros Trend (Avg Per Day)

* **Protein:** 150–180g (on target for shred + muscle retention)
* **Carbs:** 180–220g (higher on training/hike days, solid for recovery)
* **Fat:** 50–70g (sometimes on the higher end when salmon, avocado, or cheese included)
* **Calories:** \~2,200–2,600 depending on training/hike intensity

Join the Marine Park Young Adults Association Inc. on Friday, September 19th at 6:00 PM at Marine Park Coffee (3411 Ave S, Brooklyn) for a night of games, food, music, and community. Open to young adults ages 18–35, this is the perfect chance to meet new people and enjoy a welcoming atmosphere.

We’ll start the night with retro video games and board games for everyone to enjoy. Play classics from NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and Nintendo 64. Sam, President of the Marine Park Young Adults Association, will be bringing a Hyperkin Retron 5, so feel free to bring your own NES, SNES, or Genesis cartridges. If board games are more your style, we’ll have favorites like Monopoly, Scrabble, Connect 4, Uno, Jenga, Sorry!, and Guess Who. Whether you want something competitive, silly, or lighthearted, there will be plenty of options to join in.

Later in the night, we’ll turn things up with karaoke! It’s a chance to grab the mic, sing your heart out, and share some laughs. Karaoke is totally optional, so you can perform or just cheer on friends.

We’ll also have pizza and soft drinks available. A $2 food fee covers pizza and soda but isn’t required. Admission is $5 per person, which helps cover the rental of the coffee shop space from the owner of Marine Park Coffee. Pizza will also be available for $2 a slice.

Between the games, karaoke, food, and community vibe, this event has something for everyone and is a great way to connect with other young adults in southern Brooklyn.

Idk when he started but he takes supplements. He has told me he’s up to 60 pills a day. Idk if that’s multiples of certain ones or what. Everything from mushrooms to caffeine to like every vitamin. He says he does research on his supplements and he seems to get excited when he finds a new one and tells me. 
I guess my question is.. when do supplements become harmful? He thinks he feels great for his age. I think he’s high on caffeine pills and coffee but who am I to judge? If I cannot help him get the medical help (since he refuses and says he’d rather die) do I just let him do what he does? I feel like he’d respond to real data or information if I’m saying that right.

 Do you think there's much of a difference in flavor compared to the traditional technique, where we cook over low heat and wait for it to start bubbling? Which technique do you use?

Many times we react to things that do not even matter to us, but this can become a guide for young minds starting out. Let me share my journey before I finally settled into SEO.

I worked in hotels, did sales in real estate, tried offline sales, distributed pamphlets, worked as a receptionist, and even did ground staff work at a resort where I cleaned rooms. I also worked in a toy shop and later in a purses store. After that I tried coding, explored UI and UX, and this is where I first started to feel an interest in SEO. I learnt graphic design and worked with some global names to create graphics for blogs and social media.

Later, I moved into CMS development and built websites for three brands. I even started my own hotel booking agency which eventually failed. After that, I tried interior accessories like wallpapers and wall coverings. I earned well there but lost interest, so I closed the business. That was when I learnt that not everything that gives money is meant for you.

I then got into content writing, and when AI started growing, I began exploring it seriously. I studied AI and large language models, created custom bots with Ora AI was very new I connected with owner of brand on Discord, and even sold custom chatbots when custom bots were still very advanced back in 2022. Eventually I came back to SEO where I now focus on AI content generation, automation, and prompt engineering, always keeping myself updated.

Today, I enjoy working in SEO, though some days can feel stressful. This field requires constant upgrading and staying aware of Google and other search engine algorithms. It is fun if you enjoy pushing yourself beyond limits you thought you could not reach. If you like technical things, technical SEO might be for you.

In the long run, I would say choose something that your heart feels connected to. It does not mean you will love every single day, but it should not be something you never wanted to do in the first place. I love what I do. Some days I don’t feel like working, but most days I genuinely enjoy it. Do not go only for money, go for what makes you feel alive.

Any doubts and queries for any of the fields mentioned, feel free, you have questions you think must be silly to ask, no one knows you in person, ask them, I am open to answer all regarding my field or any of the fields I have worked in :)",0,1757633522.0,jobs,0,0.33,False

1nenwwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trendinfo/comments/1nenwwk/i_accidentally_discovered_aliexpresss_secret_most/,I Accidentally Discovered AliExpress’s Secret “Most Sheep” Universe at 2AM—And Now I’m Questioning Reality 🐑💻,"So I was scrolling through AliExpress the other night (as one does, at 2 AM, because sleep is apparently optional), and I stumbled into what might be one of the stranger corners of the internet shopping universe: **the “most sheep” situation**.  

Like… AliExpress has absolutely everything, we already know that. Gadgets, skincare, fake brand sneakers, LED lights for closets I don’t even have. But sheep? Straight-up listings for sheep—or sheep-themed things that are *so literal*—it made me stop and ask myself: who’s buying “sheep” online in bulk??  

Here were my stages:  

- **Excitement**: “OMG, I knew AliExpress was random but the sheep collection is NEXT-LEVEL AMAZING!”  
- **Confusion**: “Wait… are these real? Are they toys, costumes, fleece jackets, or worse… actual livestock?? How is shipping even possible?”  
- **Existential Crisis**: “If the world has reached a point where you can impulse order *sheep* off Aliexpress like phone cases, have we won the hustle, or completely lost it?”  

It honestly made me think about how AliExpress induces this wild kind of digital window-shopping hypnosis. You type in one random word, and suddenly you’re considering a herd of woolly animals in the checkout cart.  

And the kicker? Some of these listings were tagged as “bestsellers.” Like. PEOPLE. ARE. BUYING. THEM. So what does that say about supply and demand psychology online? Or maybe it’s just me falling into a bizarre ecommerce rabbit hole.  

Here’s what stuck out in this “most sheep” exploration:  

- Listings can range from **adorable sheep pillow plushies** to what LOOKS LIKE procurement for actual farm animals.  
- Some descriptions weren’t even translated properly, making it more hilarious/confusing.  
- The price swings are insane. One minute it’s $5 for a strange sheep keychain, the next it’s $499 for something no one with rational decision-making should click “buy” on without a lot of coffee first.  
- AliExpress seems to market intimacy with absurdity—you can literally scroll past five Apple AirPod knockoffs and land on something that basically screams “farmyard in your Honda Civic, let’s go.”  

Which brings me to the question I’m chewing on: maybe it’s not about “most sheep” literally. Maybe it’s about how AliExpress microcosms represent the internet as a whole. Noise, randomness, raw consumer desire disguised as novelty. But still. Sheep??  

And I have to just pause and plug this because it was right in my recommended and I STILL can’t figure out how it ended up there…  

**Top On Sale Product Recommendations!**  
**Ankle Fracture Fixation, Night Use, Daily Walking Brace, Foot Drop Fracture Fixation Support and Fixator**  
**Price Now: USD 48.79 (Original price: USD 57.40, 15% off)**  
🔗**Click & Buy:** [https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_ompIzT7)  

Okay but WHY is AliExpress like this: you’re trying to sort through sheep questions and suddenly your fractured ankle problems are being solved in one convenient click. Maybe they know us better than we know ourselves.  

So now, I throw it back to you fine people:  

- Have you ever bought something on AliExpress that made you deeply question reality?  
- Do you think “most sheep” is meant literally or metaphorically (like a codeword for mass-produced cotton goods)?  
- Or is this simply another example of AliExpress serving as the dream factory for insomniacs with $20 and no filter?  

Because if someone here has actually ordered sheep from AliExpress and had them shipped… we need. The. Full. Story.

\[Sat amits the crowds of other Fawn at a little tound table is a talish grey wolf, and a mottled brown rabbit, each with a paper cup of coffee in hand\]

""Thanks for the Coffee, Aloe. How are you feeling? You seem Calmer""

""Oh, it's the least I could do, and yes, I'm going to be alright, just a few bruises, how about you, those scratches didn't look nice""

\[her gaze flickers for a moment to the bandages through the holes in his shirt, small crimson stains around the edges of the ripped fabric\]

""Oh, thesee, I'll be fine, I've had worse, my friends and I used to tussle a lot when we were younger, sometimes it get's a little heated, especialy if snacks were on the line, and we end up whith some pulled fur or the odd scrach, i have a scar from one of them actualy, we were figting over the last Watermelon slice, so it's... sorry i'm rambling, are you ok you seem uncomfortable?""

*""Well, yeah, you're talking about fighting again, she probably doesn't want to think of fights right now, idiot""*

*""Sorry, let me change the subject, I'm sure you don't want to hear about it, what are you doing at the Uni, what are you studying, I mean?""*

\[She takes a moment to respond, seemingly concerned, looking around the cafeteria\]

""No, no I'm ok... Um... is it just me or are people staring at us? I feel like we're being stared at""

\[Silver glances around before returning his attention to her\]

""Yes, they have been staring since we sat down. I usually get stared at when I sit in here. This place might not be segregated, but the Eastt Cafe here is predominantly Prey species, so I didn't think about it much, but this is more than normal, they are staring at you too""

\[Her ears fold down nervously as she looks around again, as the room seems to get quieter\]

""ok, now I *am* uncomfortable, but considering all the gossip that's going on about what happened, I probably shouldn't be surprised, you know what I know, a better cafe off campus, it's a bit of a walk, but it's nice""

\[She stands up and slings her bag over her shoulder, abandoning her half-finished coffee\]

""It's this way""

\[Seemingly conflicted, and a little surprised, Silver stood thare for a moment before picking up his bag and following\]

\[The pair walk through the busy city street, working themselves through the maze of towers of Concrete & glass and winding alleyways until they reach one of the city's parks\]

""It's that one thare, the Coffie & Quill, it's a cosy little place""

\[before them stands an old-looking building, the exterior is clad in white stucco, broken up by black stained wooden beams. A large bay window by the door reveals an equally old interior. Stepping inside, the smell of Coffee, Cake, & Paper fills the senses, bookshelves from floor to ceiling cover the walls, save for the back wall, where the counter stands, dim warm yellowish orange lights hang from the ceiling beams, illuminating the clusters of armchairs and sofas surrounding the scattered tables.\]

""See, I told you it was a cosy place, much quieter too, and the food is great, they make the best garden salad!""

\[smiling behind the counter is a light brown feathered owl woman, dressed in vintage clothes, she nods with a smile\]

""Aww, thank you, sweetie. It's lovely to see you again. We were worried you had moved. We haven't seen you in a while. How are you, and who's your friend? Oh, and don't worry, Mr, we're mixed, you're more than welcome here""

\[Aloe approaches the counter while eyeing down the display case filled with pastries & cakes\]

""Thanks and sorry for making you worry, I have just been so busy with Uni recently that I have barely left campus, I'm just stopping by for someplace quiet for a bit, sometimes it can all get a bit loud out thare""

\[the owl nods\] ""Well, we always have a quiet corner if you need it, ok, so what can I get you two?""

""Oh, just two Capichinos please, oh and some... Hmmm, I can never choose, silver, what do you like?""

""Me, I'm not too fussy really, but I suppose I'd have the... the... ok yeah that is a hard one, Coffie cake or Cinomon rolls""

\[The barista Chuccles\]

""Ok, ok, yeah, cinnamon rolls please""

""Sure, you two take a seat, and either Jess or I will bring it to you, oh, and we have the next chapter of King of the Stags in now, thare's a copy up on the second floor, if you want to take a look, and we kept a copy out back for you, this ones a good one!""

\[Aloe's ears perk up a little\]

\[Silver nods, seeming to recognise the name\] ""Oh, I've heard about that one. Isn't it getting a TV show soon?"",

\[Aloe's ear twitches again\] ""Not a good one, the director is terrible! he absolutely butchered the last adaptation he made, the Witching is meant to be a redemption story, why did they have to go completely off book and make it so dark!?, his friends are meant to save him from his darkness, and...""

\[Silver suppresses a laugh\]

""Hay, what's so funny! It's true the actors quit after season one, they had to replace some of the cast because they didn't like how bad it was, it was such a waste, it could have been so good!""

\[The two of them continue thare debate over TV adaptations while they wait for thare coffee\]

""And so before the big game, in the books, they discover the sabotage. *After* the game starts, and they have to try and counter it, but in the Show, they find it beforehand, and they fix it, it just completely kills the tension...""

\[Silver's ramble trails off as someone comes up the stairs, a charcoal grey cat in a similar style vintage dress, carefully balancing a tray in her paws\]

""Ah, I knew you would be in your corner, a *rabbit of habit* as my grandmother would say, here's your drinks""

\[She puts down the tray before leaning in to hug Aloe\]

""We've missed you, me and Andria worried about you, thare are rumours that someone got attacked at the Uni, and here you are with a wounded wolf, so I'm guessing that was you?""

\[Aloe Nods, giving a Muffled answer, her face squished into Jess's fur\]

""Are you two ok? Wait, no, let me get her first, we want the story""

\[She lets go of Aloe and jogs back to the stairs\] ""Honey, the uni rumour was true, someone attacked Aloe!""

\[Hurrying up the stairs, her feathers puffed up\] ""So that's what you meant when you said you needed a quiet spot!, No wonder pour girl""

\[After assuring them that the two of them were ok, they retell the story to Jess & Andria\]

\[Jess's tail flicks back and forth, the agitation clear in her face\]

""Seriously, kids these days!, acting like Mobsters, it's just some damed grass, it's not worth fighting over, let alone attacking someone over it, even if he can't have it on campus, just go out on the weekends to a cat bar, thare are enough of them in the city""

\[Her plumage still puffed up around her shoulder. Andria nods in agreement\]

""I still think it's unreasonable that you got suspended for all of that, you were clearly trying to help her, honestly i don't understand what's hapening out there, I understand they have to be careful about everything, especially in an institution, but if I'm honest I think it's becausee your, you know, a *Carnivor* well technically a facultative Carnivor, not an Obligate carnivor, but now i'm infodumping and you already know that because you are you and you know what you can eat, and i'm still talking, sorry i do this sometimes, i start alking and then i don't stop becuse my brain just keeps speaking and i dont mute it becuse it just get louder in mt head, and i'm still talking sorry""

\[The conversation continues for another hour or so, Jess & Andria talking about thare experiences with living as adults in an integrated society, and some stories from thare grandparents who lived before the integration began\]

\[Aloe finishes the Tea Jess brought up for them all sometime between the story's\]

""Thank you for all of that and thanks for the tea, but it's starting to get dark, so we should be getting back to our dorms. I think it's past your closing time, and I don't want to keep you forever""

\[Jess begins to collect up the cups\] ""Oh, it's no worry, we're just happy to give you someplace safe to stay for the evening after everything, and besides, our studio is just above the shop, so we're never far from home""

\[Andria wanders back upstairs with two boxes, handing one to each of them\] ""Here's some Cake to go, and that new edition, it's on us. Now speaking of safe, do you two need any help getting back? Will you be ok?""

\[Silver glances at Aloe\] ""I'm ok walking myself, but I understand if you want to call a friend or a Zuber or something""

\[Aloe Fasten's her coat\] ""I'm quite capable of walking, though I'd appreciate it if you walked with me, it's never a wise idea to walk alone at night, even if you have big teeth""

""Alright then, we'll walk together. It shouldn't take long to make sure your coat is closed, it's meant to be windy and cold""

\[The two of them step out, the shopkeepers waving them farewell, stepping out into the now Gusty and dimly lit park, and begin to walk home\]

\[Aloe looks up towards silver, his paws tucked into his pocket.\] ""Aren't you cold? You only have a shirt, a shirt with holes in it at that""

\[He looks at her for a moment before his eyes return to scaning the street's\] ""Not realy no, i- well my family come's from up north, were grey wolves, i'm used to Snow up to my thighs my fur is thick, make's me look bulkyer than i actualy am, espcialy when my winter coat come's in, it's horible in summer, it's warm and i shed everywhare, my dormate's make a compatirion every year to see who can make the largest bail of fur, each room come's togeather as a team, and...""

\[Aloe interrupts him, her ear's twisting outwards, her tail twitching, she whispers a small hint of fear in her voice\] 

""I think we're being followed. Take this right coming up, and cross over the green on the next street, so we can get a look at them. If we are being followed, they will have to show themselves if they don't want to lose us""

\[Silver just nods whispering back\] ""Ok if we are, then don't let them know you hear them"" 

\[he returns to telling the story, trying to pretend everything is ok\] ""It gets pretty heated, sometimes. I wasn't here the year it happened, but apparently, one year, a room of guys shaved themselves super short just to get ahead, and they still lost to the Husky Triplet's""

\[halfway across the empty green, Silver looks back and picks up the pace\] ""I see them, and I think they know we're onto them. How fast can you run? If we can make it to the Boulevard, we will be ok, it's always busy, should be an open bar or something, we can stay thare and call the police""

\[With a Quiver in her voice, she responds as she breaks into a sprint\] ""I'm fast, I have to be. It's all we pray have going for us""

\[Silver takes off after her, just about managing to keep pace\] ""Ok, you are fast, let's hope we're faster than them""

\[The chase begins, the pursuer's now abandoning stealth, they turn on flashlights and headtorches, illuminating the running Duo thare, shadows running ahead of them, voices come from the sources of light\]

""You should have kept your nose out of our business, stupid Hare, and you, you flea-ridden dog, should mind your own business""

\[The shadows grow shorter as the chasers grow closer. Aloe's pace begins to slow, her bruises now taxing her strength. Silver yells to her\]

""As soon as I'm in front of you, jump on my back!, We're running from cats I can smell them, they're faster than me, but they can't outlast me, we just need to get to the end of that street!"" 

\[Silver grows with exersion as he runs, leaning forward, waiting to catch her, Aloe Leaps!\] ""Ahhhhhh! LEAVE us ALONE, we don't even know who you are!""

\[He catches her as she throws her arms over his shoulders, grasping at the straps of his backpack, just about managing to keep his balance, speaks, between pants and gasps for air\] 

""Grab- *^(pant, pant)* My, -my water *^(Gasp)* Bottle, if they get close, chuck it at thare face!""

\[With a panicked squeak, Aloe yanks the steel bottle from the side pouch of his backpack and turns her head to look at the pursuers, swinging the bottle like a bat\] ""Get back!""

\[one of them is almost on thare heels as they enter the alleyway, the Bulivard just at the end, the cat is winding to lunge when with a shriek Aloe throws it, colliding with his face with a loud clang, the cat yelps loudly, stumbling and grabbing at his face and shouting\]

\[Silver's legs are screaming at him, his lungs burning, his throat dry, he musters a howl, as they reach the last few meters of the alleyway, breaking out into the Bukevard, and howls again as he clutches a lampoast as his legs start to give out on him\]

\[hearing the howl, emerging from bars and shops along the boulevard, other wolves and dogs start to run over to see what the commotion is, the pursuers exit the alleyway and surround Silver & Aloe, but before they can grab them, they find themselves surrounded, 5 Hounds, 10 Hounds, 16 Hounds, outnumbered and Outfanged they scrable away down the allyway and back into the darkness...\]

1nensoh,https://i.redd.it/nodwjifbdmof1.jpeg,Not safe for microwave bowl put in microwave,"Hello, I am very sorry if this post is very irrelevant to this subreddit, but I really did not know where else to ask.

So I have this ceramic bowl and mug set that have those little signs on their box saying ""not safe for dishwasher"" AND ""not safe for microwave"". Well, my boyfriend put the bowl in the microwave for 4 minutes. 

On the box it only says it's ceramic. Could it be dangerous now that it has been put in the microwave? I understand the dishwasher warning is probably so that the design doesn't fade. Could it have some dangerous chemicals or smth that could have been released by being in the microwave or is that also for design safety? (I grew up without a microwave and I really hate using it if you couldn't tell lol)

Pic of the set grabbed from online is attached. I tried to find the production company for more info on the material, but apparently it's been bought and gone from the face of the internet. 

tl;dr not microwave safe ceramic bowl got in microwave, can I keep using it?

1nens4e,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1nens4e/should_i_be_eating_even_after_im_full/,Should I be eating even after I’m full?,"So to be clear.. what I have found easiest, effective, and most affordable for me is eating one meal a day, plus a fiber supplement and maybe a protein shake. I eat at 1pm everyday and do my best to finish whatever has calories asap…(preferably before 2pm). 

In the morning, and after my meal, I only have sparkling water (0 cal), water, black coffee, and tea. I get slight hunger pangs but it really doesn’t bother me at all, and honestly having those pangs makes me feel like my body is working on burning fat, even if that’s just in my head, it feels good in a way.

What gets me though is during my one meal, on paper the meal isn’t crazy in calories-

**For example, my meal everyday this week is about a cup of mixed veggies (broccoli, peas, carrots) along with a whole chicken breast that’s about 13oz, and a 1/2 cup of shredded cheese.**

-but I struggle a bit to actually finish the meal and I feel guilty for eating past the point where I’m satisfied. For this meal once I eat about 2/3rds of it Im full, but I make myself eat it because first of all, I spent money on it, and second of all I feel I need the nutrients.

Should I put the food down once I’m full? Or should I continue to eat the full meal?

Start by looking at your environment removing cigarettes lighters and anything that reminds you of smoking can make a huge difference Avoid triggers for a few weeks like certain social situations or even your morning coffee

When cravings hit short distractions are better than relying on motivation alone Go for a walk chew some gum or just take a few deep breaths It sounds simple but it works Tracking your progress visually also helps Seeing the smoke free days pile up gives you momentum and keeps you going

Replacing the habit is even more important than quitting nicotine Keep your hands and mind busy with hobbies small tasks or exercise Smoking is often more about routine than the nicotine itself And finally mindset matters more than sheer willpower Focusing on I am building a smoke free life instead of I must not smoke makes a huge difference Small wins count more than forcing perfection

Do you really think quitting is just about willpower or have you found smarter strategies most people ignore??? What do you think?

1nenp45,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nenp45,I just watched real Found Footage from Daytime Television... (1988),"In 1988, “Geraldo Rivera Specials” aired their notorious “satanic panic” episode, featuring Ozzy Osborne, Anton LaVey’s daughter, ministers (*Christian and Satanist*), convicted murderers, and many more “sensational” guests. Some historians have credited this program with being a sort of pilot light for the hysteria that swept the American public at the time. Not one source has ever seemed to agree on this, so I don’t intend to add my opinion to that debate. But, I have discovered that it may have been a pilot light for something else: the 2023 found footage film, “*Late Night With the Devil*”. 

*And if it wasn’t, well, it makes this story even creepier.*

If you’re not familiar with the movie, it follows the events of a talk show episode that aired on Halloween 1977. The host attempts to boost the show’s ratings by inviting demonologists, paranormal sceptics/researchers, and an “allegedly” possessed girl onto the show to essentially debate the existence of Satan. I wish it had come with a “based on a true story” title card, because if the most recent Conjuring movie can boast that claim, *LNWtD* can absolutely do the same. 

This morning, while drinking my coffee and scrolling through the free live TV channels on Prime *(seriously, all streaming channels should offer this feature),* I came across the Geraldo Rivera Specials episode\*, “Devil Worship: Exposing Satan’s Underground,”\* from October 22, 1988. Having heard of this topic meticulously covered by alternative music historians, I took this as an opportunity to open an obscure time capsule from the year before I was born, and witness the delusional gullibility of the late eighties.

But to my surprise, it wasn’t the episode; not really. Not the way it was initially intended to be screened, at least. Instead of the dramatic daytime television edit that I was expecting, what I watched was a “master tape” of Stage Right’s camera. Just a singular, steady, unedited shot from the perspective of one person’s camera. To put it plainly, the whole thing was just eerie as fuck.

The camera never seemed to be in the right place for too long. You really begin to notice how often these shows cut from camera to camera, when you’re forced to watch the perspective of one singular lens– especially during commercial breaks. During those breaks, it simply sat there, pointed at people’s feet, the carpet, a random monitor with someone speaking out of frame, or the silhouette of Geraldo himself in the dark studio in front of a wall of monitors. To make matters even odder, there would be no audio during the commercials– just the silent scanning of the camera around the set. 

This situation was creepier during interview segments or cutaways for pre-recorded material. The house lights would dim, secluding the room in darkness, leaving nothing but a wall of monitors, with interviewers peering down at their own screens, watching parts of the program that I could only hear the audio from. News reports of murders followed by quotes from “witnesses” of these sacrifices would play off-frame, making you feel like a child hiding in your dark bedroom listening to a horror movie play from the living room.

The set sometimes seemed to resemble a control room of sorts, but it was situated just to the right of the studio audience, which made the guests appearing by video feed somewhat frightening. Interviewers would sit like floating heads, hovering in one of the monitors above the audience’s shoulder like an apparition trapped behind the glass of a CRT. Ozzy even looked oddly human just sitting there waiting for his turn. But what was the creepiest part of this presentation was a convicted murderer on death row, associated with “satanistic slayings”, who would frequently sit there with his hands buried in his face, or staring blankly into the lens, scarily waiting for the next opportunity to be spoken to. 

While I couldn’t find any evidence of this particular master tape being the source of inspiration for Colin and Cameron Caimes IFC distributed picture, I have a lot of reason to speculate that it may have been. The similarities are bizarrely parallel: 1977 and 1988, both aired in October, with satanically oriented topics, and a brash host who prioritizes ratings over morality. 

I do admit, though, that one could easily argue that my recollection of a movie with a similar premise may have obscured my perspective. However, I’d also argue that I believe it was creepy even without that knowledge. Hearing these people speak of Satanistic elements with such fervor, only to see the camera move in an almost voyeuristic manner, does inspire the imagination to go to a much darker place.

What I found to be incredibly off-putting was that it never felt too quiet or too slow, even. It seemed at times to be thoughtfully paced, as if it were fine-tuned for suspenseful beats and builds. Perhaps it was just my own feelings, but it felt like a scripted hybrid of a staged behind-the-scenes in a pseudo-live broadcast format. Much like the movie, it may have inspired. I can say to some degree this was just my own viewing because I found myself appreciating the slip-ups in Geraldo’s line deliveries to be “*immersive*” as if his stammering was there to ‘*sell the effect even more’*. I watched the entire episode, paying close attention to the dead air as if I was expecting it to breathe something thrilling. 

Of course, it didn’t, but that made it weirder for me. At the end, the show simply cut off – no final credits, no fanfare, no audience reaction– nothing. Just Geraldo looking out into the audience, in silence, as the camera feed cut to black. I sat there for a moment, wondering what the hell I just watched. A similar feeling I felt when I watched Cloverfield for the first time.. 

Yeah, I admit, I’m being romantic about this. There was no way a 1980s television special was supposed to be aired the way I watched it. But what a uniquely obtuse ride that shit was, and the first time, I can say that I have truly watched “Found Footage”. ",22,1757632740.0,ObscureMedia,2,0.92,False

Without household good/toiletries, the total would have come to just under $75/week.

Disclaimers:
* This grocery haul isn't built entirely from scratch
It is built off of pantry staples I show in the video, and I have a few stock meat items I'll be using this week as well.  I have a small freezer, but I stock up on as much meat as I can when there is a good deal.

If I were to refilm, I would probably also note butter, flour, and condiments as staples (particularly ranch dressing and mayo)

*I purchased Kroger cream cheese I forgot to note for $1.99.
* Outshine fruit bars shown were not mentioned. $2.50 for a box. A little pricey but a healthy alternative/popsicle for my kids, these seem to be on sale at my Kroger at least 2x a month.
* I do drink soda, and I buy that when budget allows and only when it's on sale at Kroger ( last week, a 24pk was on sale for $10 )
* Same applies to alcohol, my husband and I are beer drinkers. We do treat ourselves to beer when the budget allows. 
* We probably eat out as a family less than 10 times a year
* I drink instant coffee (Kroger brand)

There are links on the video to the recipes I mention. I know as a low income household that always cooks at home, it can be easy to run out of ideas so I hope these recipes help!

So while not urgent, I can't exactly relax yet in terms of the job search. I feel I am a bit at a cross roads and I'm having difficulty deciding what to do afterwards, or what I should be working towards in the meantime. As such, I am trying to connect with people in the industry via LinkedIn to gain some more insight, but I'm having a lot of difficulty. I only got one response, and they said that they ""don't do mentorship"".

I have discussed a bit with some of the profs from my university, but I wanted more insight from industry professionals. Also, they are predictably pushing me to do a PhD lol. Is there a better way to go about this?

EDIT: I realized it may be prudent for me to provide context. Most of my experience is in R and Python, so my current options are to:

1. Keep going with R and Python and pick up more DS related skills, focus on building a project portfolio to go for DS or DS adjacent roles
2. Get my SAS certifications and try to work at a CRO
3. Do a PhD; there's a prof at Brown I'm interested in working with, though I have not talked to her yet about this

Thank you in advance!",5,1757632441.0,biostatistics,0,1.0,False

1nenk3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1nenk3v/has_anyone_seen_this_i_just_watched_real_found/,Has anyone seen this? I just watched real Found Footage from 1988 Daytime Television...,"In 1988, “Geraldo Rivera Specials” aired their notorious “satanic panic” episode, featuring Ozzy Osborne, Anton LaVey’s daughter, ministers (*Christian and Satanist*), convicted murderers, and many more “sensational” guests. Some historians have credited this program with being a sort of pilot light for the hysteria that swept the American public at the time. Not one source has ever seemed to agree on this, so I don’t intend to add my opinion to that debate. But, I have discovered that it may have been a pilot light for something else: the 2023 found footage film, “*Late Night With the Devil*”. 

*And if it wasn’t, well, it makes this story even creepier.*

If you’re not familiar with the movie, it follows the events of a talk show episode that aired on Halloween 1977. The host attempts to boost the show’s ratings by inviting demonologists, paranormal sceptics/researchers, and an “allegedly” possessed girl onto the show to essentially debate the existence of Satan. I wish it had come with a “based on a true story” title card, because if the most recent Conjuring movie can boast that claim, *LNWtD* can absolutely do the same. 

This morning, while drinking my coffee and scrolling through the free live TV channels on Prime *(seriously, all streaming channels should offer this feature),* I came across the Geraldo Rivera Specials episode*, “Devil Worship: Exposing Satan’s Underground,”* from October 22, 1988. Having heard of this topic meticulously covered by alternative music historians, I took this as an opportunity to open an obscure time capsule from the year before I was born, and witness the delusional gullibility of the late eighties.

But to my surprise, it wasn’t the episode; not really. Not the way it was initially intended to be screened, at least. Instead of the dramatic daytime television edit that I was expecting, what I watched was a “master tape” of Stage Right’s camera. Just a singular, steady, unedited shot from the perspective of one person’s camera. To put it plainly, the whole thing was just eerie as fuck.

The camera never seemed to be in the right place for too long. You really begin to notice how often these shows cut from camera to camera, when you’re forced to watch the perspective of one singular lens– especially during commercial breaks. During those breaks, it simply sat there, pointed at people’s feet, the carpet, a random monitor with someone speaking out of frame, or the silhouette of Geraldo himself in the dark studio in front of a wall of monitors. To make matters even odder, there would be no audio during the commercials– just the silent scanning of the camera around the set. 

This situation was creepier during interview segments or cutaways for pre-recorded material. The house lights would dim, secluding the room in darkness, leaving nothing but a wall of monitors, with interviewers peering down at their own screens, watching parts of the program that I could only hear the audio from. News reports of murders followed by quotes from “witnesses” of these sacrifices would play off-frame, making you feel like a child hiding in your dark bedroom listening to a horror movie play from the living room.

The set sometimes seemed to resemble a control room of sorts, but it was situated just to the right of the studio audience, which made the guests appearing by video feed somewhat frightening. Interviewers would sit like floating heads, hovering in one of the monitors above the audience’s shoulder like an apparition trapped behind the glass of a CRT. Ozzy even looked oddly human just sitting there waiting for his turn. But what was the creepiest part of this presentation was a convicted murderer on death row, associated with “satanistic slayings”, who would frequently sit there with his hands buried in his face, or staring blankly into the lens, scarily waiting for the next opportunity to be spoken to. 

While I couldn’t find any evidence of this particular master tape being the source of inspiration for Colin and Cameron Caimes picture, I have a lot of reason to speculate that it may have been. The similarities are bizarrely parallel: 1977 and 1988, both aired in October, with satanically oriented topics, and a brash host who prioritizes ratings over morality. 

I do admit, though, that one could easily argue that my recollection of a movie with a similar premise may have obscured my perspective. However, I’d also argue that I believe it was creepy even without that knowledge. Hearing these people speak of Satanistic elements with such fervor, only to see the camera move in an almost voyeuristic manner, does inspire the imagination to go to a much darker place.

What I found to be incredibly off-putting was that it never felt too quiet or too slow, even. It seemed at times to be thoughtfully paced, as if it were fine-tuned for suspenseful beats and builds. Perhaps it was just my own feelings, but it felt like a scripted hybrid of a staged behind-the-scenes in a pseudo-live broadcast format. Much like the movie, it may have inspired. I can say to some degree this was just my own viewing because I found myself appreciating the slip-ups in Geraldo’s line deliveries to be “*immersive*” as if his stammering was there to ‘*sell the effect even more’*. I watched the entire episode, paying close attention to the dead air as if I was expecting it to breathe something thrilling. 

Of course, it didn’t, but that made it weirder for me. At the end, the show simply cut off – no final credits, no fanfare, no audience reaction– nothing. Just Geraldo looking out into the audience, in silence, as the camera feed cut to black. I sat there for a moment, wondering what the hell I just watched. A similar feeling I felt when I watched Cloverfield for the first time.. 

Yeah, I admit, I’m being romantic about this. There was no way a 1980s television special was supposed to be aired the way I watched it. But what a uniquely obtuse ride that shit was, and the first time, I can say that I have truly watched “Found Footage”.

Then I get a call from the regional staffing manager that they want to get coffee or lunch to discuss contracts. 

I figure they’ll be discussing job terms since the staffing lead said earlier they want to bring me on.  

I get to the shop and we order coffee and then we walk around this market and this antique store like we’re sight seeing, and there’s no mention of a job offer or preferences or my skill set or experience- like what is even going on? 
Then we get lunch and still no discussion, they’re just talking to me about sports, my interests, the local area, pets etc. keep in mind I barely know these people other than for two teams interviews.

It’s the pavilion in Illinois. They’re getting sued right now for all the sexual assaults that occur there. Thankfully nothing like that happened to me but it says a lot about the standard of care. 

This place pushed me to my mental limit, but I still feel like I’m being overly sensitive so I’ll list some of what I remember. 

Things that happened: 

They tried to keep me for 4 extra days for no reason. Most places it’s 3 but there’s 5 is standard. Got told by 3 nurses I’d be out in 5 days and the day of my discharge they wanted to keep me longer. That place is run for profit I was all good to leave. I got out by annoying them because that was the ONLY way to get any answers. 

Had to hound them about calling in my meds. Got warned about this on my way out 

They had bands we had to wear and they checked on us every 15 minutes the entire time. And yes during the night too. They came in with a damn flashlight and put it in your face. 

The shower. Took 15 minutes just to heat up. So the nurses saw a lot of me fully naked which I hated and then just got used to 

They blocked my best friends number and she was keeping me sane in there. Patient phones wouldn’t call her only the front desk. And no one outside the place had issues calling her. I called her a lot because the only time I got answers or results was by doing that . Guess they got tired of it.

Staff was rude and wanted you to crash out

This woman was always crying and we as patients did more to help her. That was true in general, I got more support and care from the other people there

My shower curtain was broken I told them for 2 days and they told me to deal with it because they’re all like that. Oh and this added to them being able to see EVERYTHING

They lost my box for hygiene stuff and instead of getting me a new box they gave me a cup with my name on it 

Staff cussed and yelled at us and I heard one say that she could get her sons to jump someone

Wouldn’t let a service dog into the cafeteria.

Food was horrible and had to take it like a pill. Overcooked to hell or cold in the middle of

Went outside once in 5 days, and was never given sides so made to play games on concrete so I got a blood blister 

Also no slides meant I had a pair of socks for the shower so I didn’t get some kinda disease 

One spoon to stir coffee for everyone 

Black mold 

I saw a piece of metal hanging of the wall 

They didn’t care I had a pen. Luckily I was never a threat to myself or others 

Everything had to be “doctors approved” so no personal shower stuff or slides for me 

“Doctors visits” were them just walking up and asking if you’re okay 

We were supposed to have groups all day but they rarely happened so they just had us sitting in the day room.

1nenesg,https://i.redd.it/vqdfaqz5amof1.jpeg,“Do Not Fear.” The Quantum Science of Trusting The Divine Algorithm of Your Life,"Many people believe that the opposite of love is hate, when in fact it is fear. Fear is the most universal human experience that many other feelings and emotions stem from – including anger, hate, and of course, fear itself. Every culture, every religion, and every language has spoken to these three words. And throughout thousands of years, these words have been important enough to have been repeated like a heartbeat across time: Do not fear.

But what does this mean, beyond philosophies or scriptures? What if science – specifically quantum science – is beginning to show us why these three words might be the deepest truth we’ve ever needed to understand?

The Biology of Fear

Fear starts in the brain as I’m sure you know. When you sense danger, your amygdala – the brain’s alarm center – lights up. Adrenaline surges. Your body prepares for fight or flight. This response bio-adapted as a safety measure to keep us alive when crocodiles and other predators stalked our ancestors.

But today, most of our fears are not from predators. They are from bills, fear of rejection, fear of failure, the fear of not being “enough.” Your body doesn’t know the difference between our ancient fears and our new modern ones – it reacts the exact same way. And when fear runs unchecked, it doesn’t just drain your energy. It also programs your subconscious mind.

Think of your subconscious mind as a quantum hard drive: it stores patterns, habits, and beliefs that shape how you see reality. If you let fear be written into that code, your reality bends to it – whether you are consciously aware of it or not.

As I explore more deeply in my book, The Other 95%: Unleashing the Power You Forgot You Had, the subconscious doesn’t just react or bend to fear – it programs it into your reality until you learn how to rewrite the code.

Your Reality Responds to Your Expectations

In quantum physics, there’s something called the observer effect. At the smallest scales, particles don’t exist in fixed states until they are observed (sounds like science fiction, but it is a scientific fact). They hover in probabilities – waves of potential. But the moment they are observed, they “collapse” into what you and most would refer to as a reality.

Here’s the wild part: expectation and observation both literally shape matter. Energy responds to your attention. What you expect is what tends to appear – not what you “want”.

Fear, then, is not just an emotion – it’s an instruction from inside of you out to the universe around you. A signal of “collapse” into worst-case possibilities. When we fear, we aim our attention, both conscious and subconscious, at what we do not want, and quantum science suggests that reality is actually listening.

Why “Do Not Fear” Is Universal

Every spiritual belief repeats this same truth:

– Christianity (Bible – Old and New Testament): “Do not fear”
– Judaism (Torah and Tanakh): “Fear not”
– Islam (Quran): “Do not fear”
– Hinduism (Bhagavad Gita, Vedas, and Upanishads): “Do not yield to fear”
-Indigenous/Native American Teachings: “Fear is the greatest sickness that runs through our people. Let it go…”

Why would these cultures and many others (I mean no disrespect by only listing a few of the well known spiritual beliefs in case yours is not listed – my personal perception is I see A truth, not THE truth within every religion and/or belief system, including the non-belief systems so to me everyone is correct in their own belief  – and who am I to judge you or anyone anyways), separated by oceans and centuries of time, all arrive at the same essential phrase? Because fear blocks us from aligning with what is possible.Science now echoes what mystics have always taught: when you let fear control your choices, you reduce the infinite wave of possibilities into the narrowest of potential outcomes.

But when you step into your own courage – or even if you do it just one little step or fear at a time – you reopen your field of potential back up. You give the divine algorithm of life a chance to reprogram into something greater, something you love instead of something you fear.

A Relatable Example

Imagine you’re late for work, in a hurry, and you spill your coffee on yourself. You’re angry, stemming from a fear of being judged. That mindset creates a cascade of fear-based frequencies: you hit almost every red light driving, you snap at a coworker when you usually are in control of your reactions, and the day continues this way and spiraling in a path not desired.

But if you pause, take a few deep breaths, and refuse to allow fear to win – in doing this you shift the outcome. You may still be late, but you will arrive more calm, less stressed, and suddenly the day realigns toward forgiveness frequencies (self-forgiveness is just as important as forgiving others – will cover this in a later article). This shows that the same singular event or series of events can cause different possible frequencies depending on your reaction, thus leading you into very different realities so to speak. (Fun fact: scientifically speaking it’s not possible for any situation or event to cause you anxiety or stress – only your reaction to that situation or event)

It’s not “magic thinking” as some would believe. It’s just the mechanics of energy, attention, and biology all working together in ways that can now be explained and understood.

Fear Contracts, Love Expands

Fear is a constriction on your life. It narrows your vision (eyes and mind), restricts your physical body, and collapses your field of possibilities. When gratitude, love, or even trust is felt, even for a few moments at a time, your field of possibilities within the divine algorithm expands. It reopens your perception, relaxes your physical body, and invites solutions.

Quantum biology shows that your physical cells also respond differently to your feelings: fear suppresses your immune function; while trust and gratitude enhance it. Your very biology whispers the same truth as almost all ancient texts: Do Not Fear.

The Viral Takeaway

Across time, across religions, and now across quantum sciences, the message is crystal clear: Fear shrinks the potential of your life. Love expands the potential of your life.

“Do not fear” is not about denial or any superstition. It is about alignment. It is a reminder that your reality itself is not fixed – it is fluid, responsive, and waiting for your awareness and focus.

Once you truly and fully remember this, you reclaim your power. You stop living in reaction and survival, and start living in gratitude and abundance.

So next time you feel fear of any kind, just pause. Take a couple deep breaths – and whisper to remind yourself the three words that connect science, spirituality, and all of humanity across continents and lasting for thousands of years:

Do. Not. Fear.

Because in that moment, you collapse the wave of fear into waves of incredible possibility. You choose freedom over limitation. You open the door to the extraordinary.

*The question is: what would your life look like if fear no longer controlled your choices? This question was one of many that inspired me to write The Other 95% where I share practical steps for shifting your fear into strength and unlocking the power your mind has been holding within you all along.

Ello ello, I'm Lewis, 31M and from the UK.

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day 🤭. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath 🤗.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL.

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

- I've been creating an android game for the past year or so in my spare time. Programming is hard at times but very rewarding. 
- I also have a 6 year old daughter with my ex. Would be great to connect with other parents.

What I'm looking for in you:
- Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
- We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
- Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule

So I was told in august that this staffing lead who had interviewed me for a previous role which I didn’t get wants to get coffee or lunch with me sometime in September. Then I get a call from the regional staffing manager that they want to get coffee or lunch to discuss contracts. 

I figure they’ll be discussing job terms since the staffing lead said earlier they want to bring me on.  

I get to the shop and we order coffee and then we walk around this market and this antique store like we’re sight seeing, and there’s no mention of a job offer or preferences or my skill set or experience- like what is even going on? 
Then we get lunch and still no discussion, they’re just talking to me about sports, my interests, the local area, pets etc. keep in mind I barely know these people other than for two teams interviews.

Over the lunch there’s still no discussion of anything related to a job except that they tell me they have a proposal they’re working on in one city and then it ends and they say we will keep in touch. So it was an hour and 15 minutes social outing for no reason. I presumed they would bring up a position they’re considering me for or where they’d want me in the company but no.

I am disappointed. I thought this would end in an offer after searching for seven months. This company has led me on since mid July. I just am tired of this job search and honestly done. ",1,1757631759.0,jobsearch,0,1.0,False

Despite eating a relatively clean diet and working out frequently, I’ve continued to have flare ups ever so often, especially around special occasions when I eat out of my normal diet or drink alcohol. I was prescribed omprazole but haven’t seen much help.

However, in between work and school, I need some form of caffeine but it has proven to be one of my biggest triggers. Rather than get heartburn, I’m in constant pain over this bloating, which also in turn affects my overall appetite. I’ve looked into low acidic coffees but not sure if that would be much help in my case. I typically make my own, and avoid dairy in case, using Nescafé Gold espresso powder.

I wanted to see if there was any suggestions or recommendations that has helped with someone that may have dealt with the same thing. I’m at the point where I’m really willing to completely cut out certain things if necessary but it seems to be triggered by almost anything at times, which makes day to day life difficult. I had voiced my concerns and discomfort with a doctor but she was reluctant to send me to a specialist, which I wish I would’ve pushed more towards now that I’m seeking a new insurance.",3,1757631667.0,GERD,4,1.0,False

People should brew their coffee how they like it and SCA gospel BS not withstanding there are NO rules. This is not about that, it’s about curiosity and I am curious to hear other’s thoughts.

I always see these incredibly low coffee to water ratios thrown out on the Moccamaster subreddit when people are looking for help with it. For example, today I saw here one of the suggestions was 52g for a full pot. That is way weaker than the SCA recommendation of 1:18. That is more like 1:24! Many third-wave/specialty shops are drip brewing at 1:16. For me, 1:24 would be like hot water.

So, to get to my point, we have a subreddit for a coffee maker that retails for a jaw dropping $360, for a very simple basic machine. You would think the market for such a machine would be “coffee snobs” that would never consider drinking coffee that weak. But it seems pretty common here.

I’m curious why that is? I haven’t been keeping records. Am I thinking I see those low ratios of coffee thrown out there more than they are? What ratio do you all brew at?

I get the anger at big investors buying up whole streets and jacking up rents, but surely it’s not realistic to expect someone who isn’t a corporate landlord to rent at the housing benefit rates (£352 for a room, £472 for a 2-bed etc). Between mortgages, bills and keeping a house half decent, that wouldn’t even cover costs.

For context — I’m a live-in landlord. I rent one room for £600, but that covers literally everything: all bills (no cap on usage), fastest WiFi, tea, coffee, milk, cleaning stuff, washing liquid, softener, even a Nespresso machine with pods. The only cost my tenant has outside of rent is their main grocery shop. My house is nice and comfortable and I make a real effort to make them feel at home — not just like a lodger living out of a room. Plus I live in a nice area close to town and quick to respond to issues and buy the odd extra. 

So I’d have thought that was fair, especially in winter when heating is mad.

1nen76u,https://www.reddit.com/r/Autoimmune/comments/1nen76u/for_those_considering_cannabis/,For those considering cannabis,"I’ve been piecing something together that hit me really hard, and I think it’s worth sharing. For years I’ve dealt with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, prednisone weight gain, and brutal mood swings. I’d have black-out anger over something as small as spilled coffee, fights with my partner over nothing, worsening joint pain, and depression that felt bottomless. Every doctor told me it was just the autoimmune stuff.

After six years of this, I finally demanded labs. They came back with total testosterone around 257 ng/dL, prolactin well over 100 (way, way too high), LH at 3.5, and FSH at 2. On paper, that’s secondary hypogonadism: my pituitary isn’t sending enough signal to make testosterone, and the high prolactin is a big part of why. That kind of picture often points toward a pituitary adenoma.

Here’s the twist: I’ve been a heavy cannabis user since 2014. I only quit two weeks ago after learning all this, and when I started digging into the connection, it blew my mind. Chronic cannabis use suppresses dopamine signaling in the hypothalamus. That raises prolactin, which lowers LH and FSH, which lowers testosterone. It was the exact pattern my labs showed. Combine that with chronic inflammation from RA, failed biologics, and prednisone weight, and I ended up in the worst mental and physical state of my life, depressed, exhausted, angry, and honestly close to suicidal.

When prolactin and testosterone get thrown off, it isn’t just physical. Low dopamine plus low testosterone means flat mood, brain fog, poor focus, anger outbursts, and a heavy depression that feels impossible to climb out of. Looking back, my irritability and depression were always worse during my heaviest years of smoking. It wasn’t just weed making me lazy or unmotivated, it was the hormonal suppression behind the scenes. It’s wrecked relationships and stolen years from me.

The hopeful part: this can be at least partly reversible. Prolactin can normalize within weeks after quitting, testosterone usually rebounds in two or three months, and clarity slowly comes back as dopamine pathways reset. I’ve already started to feel a little better, even while going through mild withdrawal. I still need to see an endocrinologist and probably get a pituitary MRI, but quitting weed was hands down the best move I could’ve made.

So when people say chronic cannabis makes you “stupid,” it’s not just a stereotype. It’s hormonal reality: high prolactin, low T, suppressed dopamine. That combo wrecks mood, motivation, and clarity. Stopping gives your system a chance to breathe, but it takes time. I still think cannabis has a place, especially for pain, but using it all day every day comes with real costs people don’t want to talk about.

For years I’ve dealt with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, prednisone weight gain, and brutal mood swings. I’d have black-out anger over something as small as spilled coffee, fights with my partner over nothing, worsening joint pain, and depression that felt bottomless. Every doctor told me it was just the autoimmune stuff.

After six years of this, I finally demanded labs. They came back with total testosterone around 257 ng/dL, prolactin well over 100 (way, way too high), LH at 3.5, and FSH at 2. On paper, that’s secondary hypogonadism: my pituitary isn’t sending enough signal to make testosterone, and the high prolactin is a big part of why. That kind of picture often points toward a pituitary adenoma.

Here’s the twist: I’ve been a heavy cannabis user since 2014. I only quit two weeks ago after learning all this, and when I started digging into the connection, it blew my mind. Chronic cannabis use suppresses dopamine signaling in the hypothalamus. That raises prolactin, which lowers LH and FSH, which lowers testosterone. It was the exact pattern my labs showed. Combine that with chronic inflammation from RA, failed biologics, and prednisone weight, and I ended up in the worst mental and physical state of my life, depressed, exhausted, angry, and honestly close to suicidal.

When prolactin and testosterone get thrown off, it isn’t just physical. Low dopamine plus low testosterone means flat mood, brain fog, poor focus, anger outbursts, and a heavy depression that feels impossible to climb out of. Looking back, my irritability and depression were always worse during my heaviest years of smoking. It wasn’t just weed making me lazy or unmotivated, it was the hormonal suppression behind the scenes. It’s wrecked relationships and stolen years from me.

The hopeful part: this can be at least partly reversible. Prolactin can normalize within weeks after quitting, testosterone usually rebounds in two or three months, and clarity slowly comes back as dopamine pathways reset. I’ve already started to feel a little better, even while going through mild withdrawal. I still need to see an endocrinologist and probably get a pituitary MRI, but quitting weed was hands down the best move I could’ve made.

So when people say chronic cannabis makes you “stupid,” it’s not just a stereotype. It’s hormonal reality: high prolactin, low T, suppressed dopamine. That combo wrecks mood, motivation, and clarity. Stopping gives your system a chance to breathe, but it takes time. I still think cannabis has a place, especially for pain, but using it all day every day comes with real costs people don’t want to talk about.
