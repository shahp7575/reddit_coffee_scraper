1gt3wrg,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1gt3wrg/tifu_by_flinging_dog_mess_in_my_dream_girls_grill/,TIFU by flinging dog mess in my dream girl’s grill moo,"For the sake of this post I’m going to call her Catie. If you happen to read this please know it was a massive accident. 

The cutest girl I’ve ever seen in my life frequents a coffee shop down the street from my apartment. She always sits alone in a corner and works on her MacBook for a few hours between breakfast and lunch. 

All my cards on the table, I’m a pretty above average guy in the looks department. I apologize if this comes off as bragging but it’s relevant to the story.
I’ve never had issues talking to women because honestly they always smile when I make eye contact with them and half the time they start talking first.

That said, for literally half a year I could not even make eye contact with Catie. She was religiously engrossed in her laptop. She would also often bring her dog, a big hound, on days when the weather was nice and she opted to sit outside. 

I’d given up on trying to chat with Catie a month or two ago. She never noticed me and I accepted it wasn’t to be. This morning she’d brought her dog, however, and as I was walking in the hound immediately got up and ran to me. His leash had been looped around her chair but I guess she’d done a poor job of securing it. She jumped up, terrified, and said “grab him, grab him please!”

Apparently her dog is a runner and she was scared he’d bolt. I scooped the dog up (probably 85 pounds) and brought him over to her. Catie’s hands were shaking. She was really worried he’d run off. This was a big dog! I set him down and he licked my hand as she took his leash. 

Then she literally stepped towards me and kissed me on the cheek. Cloud 9! We’d never even spoken and now she’s kissed me. Best moment of 2024. The fact that the day would end so horrifically after such an auspicious beginning still blows my mind. What the hell!

Anyway, she introduces herself and thanks me profusely. Tells me how Mack (her pup) once ran into the woods across the street and she chased him for half a day and he almost died. Then she’s like “omg! I KISSED you. I am so sorry. What am I doing?” 

I told her with a complete straight face that it was in fact NOT ok and that my boyfriend was calling the police to report a sexual assault. Her eyes went wide and she scanned the shop looking for my boyfriend when I started laughing and she punched my arm (second best moment of my year somehow). I told her it was totally cool and asked if she wanted to go for a walk on the trail through the park at the end of the street. 

She agreed and we start walking.

I wasn’t going to describe her but I have to. She has bright red natural hair, the brightest shade of red you can imagine that wouldn’t be fake, and the greenest eyes I’ve ever seen in my life. She’s trim, 5’9 maybe, with the most gorgeous angel face I’ve seen in real life or in the movies. She’s a bona fide 11. 

Thirty minutes later we are connecting on every level. We both love rock scuba diving and tropical ports of call. We’ve read all the same books, work in tangential fields, laugh at all of each other’s jokes. It’s a sublime afternoon.

Then Mack (her dog) decides to use the restroom in the leaves beside the trail. He finishes taking a rather large and slimy bowel movement. Catie is hyper embarrassed because she doesn’t have any bags to pick it up. I tell her it’s in the leaves off trail and doubt anyone will notice anyway.

However, she INSISTS we do something. 

“Do you think I could just scoop it up below the leaves and toss it?” She asks.

“With your hands?” I say, aghast. “If it’s that big a deal I’ll do it.”

She looks grateful but also embarrassed so I bend down to scoop up this crap by cupping my hand under the leaves blanketing the forest floor.

At first it seems successful. I’ve scooped up the crap and toss it deep off the trail but then I hear Caitie say “oh no!”

As things turn out it was doggy diarrhea not just poop. My entire right hand is slimed. Instinctively I flick my hand once to get the biggest glob of poo off but it stubbornly clings on to my palm after the downward flick and instead opts to LEAVE my hand on the upswing. 

And in slow motion a massive, glob of dog shite careens into my dream girl’s face. Like covered. In her eyes, in her gorgeous hair, down to her chin. I couldn’t have repeated that if I tried for the next thousand years. She was standing 10 feet away from me as I shook off my hand. But it gobsmacks her in the face? Are you kidding?

Worse yet, she fucking screams, a blood curdling cry, and then yells “are you fucking for real?” As if I DID IT ON PURPOSE!!!!

She turns and sprints away with her dog in tow, screaming at the top of her lungs like she’s being chased by a rapist.

I just stood their in shock till the sound of her screaming vanished in the distance. 

TLDR 

I somehow managed to fling a giant handful of goopy dog poop into the face of the prettiest woman on planet earth.

In the last 5 weeks, a lot has happened. I opened a door in my life that had been sealed up for a long time. The warning label had faded, curled up, and dropped off. It used to say some stuff about being social, old emotional wreckage, and probably spiders.

To be fair, I was only going to open it a bit, have a peek, then probably close it again. But when I looked out, you were there. Like somebody holding out their hand and saying, ""Come on.""
And I did.

There is light where you are. I can see things are fine. We have coffee and bacon rolls. We talk about the stuff of life and laugh. It's comfortable. 

If I look back, I can still see that door. 
I don't think I could reach it. If I could get there, I don't think it opens from this side. That's OK, though. I like it here.

It doesn’t feel random that you were there. We’ve been neighbors for ages but never talked much. The door was closed. Maybe it was meant to open now. Maybe you were meant to be there, to show me that it’s okay to step outside, to connect.

For now, I’m grateful for every moment. Thank you for being there. And here.

I get that people have warm feelings inside, burning of the bosom, but feelings aren't facts. All people of all religions have good feelings and spiritual experiences. Feelings are not an indication of truth. 

If you find out Joseph Smith married a 14-year-old girl, do you get warm feelings in your heart telling you it's true? Why not, if it's true you should be able to feel warm and fuzzy about it, even if you don't like it something should tell you it's true. 

No, you were raised and socialized through your entire life to believe weird things about your church. Things such as--Mormonism is the only true church, you can only be with your family if you are righteous, the Book of Mormon is from real gold plates and from God. You already know, and are probably embarrassed by the temple garb and secret rituals. 

From the time you were a child and attended church each week you have had smart adults tell you these things are true, your family tells you these things are true, so, you grow up ""knowing"" the church is true no matter what the evidence shows. They tell you it's true, ""Because of your feelings.""

It's 2024, it's time to accept that Mormonism is an old-school 1800s religion that is out of touch with truth. Are archeologists joining Mormonism in droves? (The amazing stories of archeologists who did join the church have left it). Are the smartest people on earth who study religion joining the church? No, nor are those who are looking for one true religion. The people who join Mormonism are not wealthy, smart, families, but single, poor individuals down on their luck and looking for friends. They will join and come to church for a few months and then leave to find a better church. 

Be true to what you know inside, Mormonism isn't true and is easily disproven. The leaders talk about the same thing at every meeting. Just the small fact that they don't want you to drink coffee, not for a rule of health, but for obedience. That should tell you all you need to know about your leaders, they want you to be obedient only. Your best interest doesn't matter to them. Yes, there are good people in Mormonism, it's the Mormon Church that is rotten. 

It's time to accept reality and admit what 99% of the world already knows. ",3,1731811515.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

Here is the next part of the Withdrawal fanfic I’m currently writing. This is a LucanisxFemRook that takes place while Rook is trapped in Solas’ Prison. As mentioned previously, characters mentioned in the lighthouse are based on the choices I made during my own playthrough of Veilguard. This fanfic contains references to u/PunkinPumpkin ‘s fanfic “In Spite of You”. 

I hope you enjoy the fic.
————————————————————————

A familiar scent hung in the air. Roasted  coffee beans with a hint of something Lucanis couldn’t quite put his finger on. His eyes slowly opened and through his blurred vision he caught sight of an elven figure standing nearby. They seemed to be humming to themselves and were hunched over slightly. He could hear the scribbling of a quill on parchment. Were they writing in a journal? His voice came out as barely a whisper.

“…rook…?”

The figure suddenly straightened up and faced him.

“Lucanis? You’re awake!” 

As his vision cleared, Lucanis could clearly see that it wasn’t Rook standing by, but Bellara. The young Dalish woman and him had gotten to know each other well enough. Though awkward at times, he found Bellara to be good company. She was a formidable mage in her own right, but much more adept with contraptions and elven history. She was also the only other person who took the cooking rotation as seriously as he did. They had bonded over making grocery lists and swapping cooking techniques. 

The young elf looked at him with disbelief and excitement dancing in her eyes as she placed her quill and journal to the side. 

“It is you right? I mean, your eyes aren’t glowing purple, so I know it’s not Spite at least.” 

“Yes, it’s me.” The crow groaned in response. He would have rubbed his face but he felt his arm tugged back by the wrist before it could even reach his chin. In confusion his eyes darted toward his wrist, where he saw a strange contraction holding his arms and legs down to the infirmary bed. He then turned his gaze back toward Bellara with a cocked brow.

“Oh!” Bellara blurted before he even get a word out. “I’m so sorry! Let me get those for you.” She immediately got to work removing the restraints with meticulous care. “It was the best we could do…” She trailed off as she worked.

He propped himself up on his elbows, to get a closer look. They didn’t look like any restraints he was familiar with. Elven perhaps, or something Bellara had modified? He would have to ask her about it later. 

“Bellara, what happened?”

“It was after you stabbed Ghilan’nain.” She continued working as she talked, removing the first restrain and moving onto the next without pausing. 

“You lost consciousness and we brought you back to the lighthouse as we retreated. But…you weren’t exactly the first to wake up.” She finished removing the second restraint on his wrist and moved toward his ankles. Lucanis rubbed his wrists as he sat up. He caught a glimpse of some minor bruising and scratches from attempts to pull against the restraints. 

“Spite kinda went berserk while you were away…it took both Davrin and Taash to hold him down while I put these on him. Then Emmrich used a spell to sort of put you both into a deeper sleep just so we could keep him from leaving and you safe.” 

Now that he thought about it, he hadn’t noticed Spite in his sight or even lingering in his thoughts. Was it possible for the demon to be unconscious? It was a strange feeling…

“How long was I out for?” He asked.

“Oh…about a week.” She finished unlocking the third restraint and moved on to the final one. “Emmrich told us that it’s not unusual for some individuals to be asleep for days with that spell, but that we should keep an eye on you. Especially if it wasn’t well…you who woke up first again.” 

A week?! He’d been unconscious for that long. Mierda…

“We each took turns watching you, waiting for you to wake up. Davrin carved that.” She gestured toward a small figurine that looked like him. “I think Taash was very vigilant the whole time. Emmrich made sure your body was still healthy and taken care of. And I of course made sure these restraints were working as intended. But I felt like I could be doing more. So when I asked Emmrich if there was anything I could do to help get you back on your feet, he told me that sometimes familiar smells can help rouse individuals. So I thought that maybe brewing coffee would help.” She smiled a little as she finally finished fiddling with the last restraint.

“I tried a bunch of different brews. Stuff that I remembered you telling me about while cooking on rotation. Different bean blends, roast types, I even tried boiling the beans! But nothing seemed to work…until today.” She looked over toward the steaming cup on the bedside table nearby. She quickly moved to pick it up and brought it to him, nearly pushing the warm cup into his hands. “If I remember correctly, this is how Rook makes it right?” 

Lucanis looked down at the cup, swirling the coffee and taking in its scent again. A simple brew with roasted beans and chicory root. He brought brew to his lips and felt its warmth fill him. A small smile formed on his lips until he realized something…

His gaze met hers as he slowly placed the cup back on the table. 

“Where is Rook?” 

Bellara bit her lip and her eyes looked down at her feet. 

“Oh…I thought you remembered…” she said looking troubled. He could tell this wasn’t something she wanted to tell him.

“Remembered what exactly?” He could feel a pit forming in his stomach as he asked.

we started talking about the show, which trailed off into other topics of discussion, and we realized that we're really similar and get along really well. 

my friend was kinda giving us crap for being so similar, but we didnt mind cuz we find it funny that we kinda danced around each other and really only did the necessary things to be polite when we saw each other, only for us to get along really well and like talking to each other.

i even held eye contact with her, and i cant make/hold eye contact to save my life. i maintained eye contact for like... 2 minuets, before i noticed i was doing it, and i didnt do the weird shifty eye thing i do to avoid eye contact.

im so damn proud of myself for this. my friend didnt really get why me and his sister were so excited about the fact that we were able to do this when we both hate talking to people we dont know and making eye contact, because he has absolutely no problem doing it, but when his mom got home from work and we told her about it, she was so proud of us for being able to talk to each other as long as we did and get to know each other.

we knew a little bit about each other because of my friend, but until today we had only said things like ""hi, thank you, your welcome, i like your shirt"" to each other, and kinda froze up when one of us would say something to the other.

1gt3q8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoSleepAuthors/comments/1gt3q8e/theres_something_in_the_coffee/,There's something in the coffee... ,"(Looking for review)

I’ve been awake for eighteen days. 



That's not hyperbole or any form of exaggeration. I've genuinely gone all this time without any sleep or rest. 



Not even a wink.



And the craziest part is that I don't feel like I need it. I don't know how I'm still alive. These last few days have been some of the craziest in my life, and I feel like it's about to get much worse. 



It all began on the eve of one of my exams. The dreaded finals week had come around, and although I had studied for it throughout the month of April and prepared myself to the best of my ability, it was still stressing me out quite a bit. Something about having a considerable portion of grades dependent on one test… just never sat right with me. 



I had been lying in my bed for the past three hours, tossing and turning, frustrated, unable to allow myself to slip into that glorious world of slumber. It was 4 a.m… I had my next final at 8 a.m. that same day. 



Eventually, I had enough, so I decided to get out of bed and pull an all-nighter to do some extra studying. After all, staying up through the night had always been better than dozing off for two hours and then being rudely awoken, surprisingly enough. 



So, with that, I sighed, got up from my bed, and started putting on my clothes. I headed out the door into the warm, humid Floridian air. The campus library was open, as was to be expected; they were always open twenty-four hours during finals week. 



It was entirely still. The information desk was open, and some poor soul who had taken the student job was staffing it overnight. I looked over, and she didn't even move her head to notice me, staring blankly at the screen ahead of her. 



There were other people in here, too, just not a lot. Now and then, you'd see the occasional chair filled by the zombified student, with a cup of coffee in one hand, their laptop in the other, and a lovely pie of pizza resting on the table in front of them. 



*Typical.* 



In the center of the main lobby stood a beautifully made table with a white cloth draped over it. On top were two big metallic cylinders, coffee dispensers, with a basket containing a bunch of small paper cups to the right. Further to the side was a variety of creams, sugars, and sweeteners. 



The sight didn't surprise me. This school had a tradition of offering free coffee to all students during the late hours of finals week. It was a nice gesture for everyone who was stressing out about the upcoming exams, I suppose. 



I'm not a coffee drinker—never was— I despise the taste. Still… it *was* 4 a.m., and I was about to pull an all-nighter. So, with that in mind, I caved and filled up one of the paper shot cups, making sure to load it with so much cream that, frankly, you probably wouldn't be able to call it coffee anymore. 



With that, I made my way up the stairway to the right, which took me to the third floor, the computer lab. 



I made my way to one of the tens of empty computers and logged into my account, and pulled up my professor's PowerPoint presentation, relieved that I was about halfway through this cursed week and that it would all be over soon.



I practically gulped the coffee down in a minute. It tasted about how you would expect.



But the texture, the texture was off…



As the hot liquid slid its way down my throat… I felt… something like a rough surface pass by my tongue. It was almost as if little tiny balls were in the fluid, like cottage cheese, but a tad less noticeable. I didn't think much of it then, figuring it was probably something I put into the coffee or something with this particular brand. 



A quick look inside the cup revealed nothing unusual, so I quickly forgot about it. 



I was considering getting another one when, just ten minutes later, the caffeine took effect. It was insanely powerful, more than I expected. My heart was throbbing in my chest, as I was jolted into awakensss. I felt like I had just slept ten hours.



Suffice it to say, I'm glad I didn't take another one. I think I would've succumbed to cardiac arrest almost immediately. 



I continued studying in that library until about 7 a.m. when the sun began to peak over the horizon. As I exited, stepping into the crisp morning air, I still felt perfect. The heart pounding in my chest was the only thing telling me that this period of energy was artificial.



 I finally understood why people were such avid coffee drinkers now, and I thought that maybe I should do this more often. 



It ended up taking until about 2 p.m. that day for the caffeine to wear off. At last, I could feel my body begin to slow down, and the full effect of the all-nighter I had just pulled came over me like a rock. It was like somebody had snapped their fingers, and I just… crashed… 



I decided to return to my bed and attempt to sleep off last night. Not for too long, though; after all, I had more finals in the morning. And thinking of that got my fear going once again. I had said I had prepared the best I could, but the one that was coming up... Oh boy… No matter what I tried, I couldn't figure out half of it. And the thing was worth about 40% of my grade… if I didn't do well on this final, it would tank my class average.



A slight panic set in at the thought of it. I should mention that I have a mild case of anxiety. Not to the extreme where I get regular panic attacks, but just enough to make every testing situation about ten times worse than it is for anyone else. I tossed and turned for about thirty minutes in this pit of dread I was drowning in when suddenly. Something very peculiar happened.



My sleepiness disappeared again. It was just… gone… entirely and utterly vanquished. I didn't know what to make of it at first but blamed it on the adrenaline currently shooting through my veins and decided to splash some cold water on my face and take a hot shower to calm down.



It didn’t help… two hours of laying there passed… nothing… It didn't make sense to me. It was as if the crash had just… ended…



As I wasn't getting any sleep, I decided to use this time to work some more. Being so worried about what was coming up and all, and I did just that until about 11 p.m. that night… 



And again… I just… still didn't feel tired… I spent hours tossing and turning, hoping, begging myself to fall asleep, but no dice. 



I had enough at this point. 



I pulled out my phone and did a quick google search on how long caffeine is supposed to last. Most results pointed me in the direction of four to six hours, with the more extreme estimates being up to twelve. This had already gone far longer than any of the websites suggested. 



I rationalized it away by saying that perhaps I was just sensitive to caffeine and that since this was my first real exposure, it would take a while for the effects to subside. 



I was going to crash eventually. I just needed to wait it out. 



But that didn't happen. It was now 4 a.m., and I was still lying awake in bed, feeling no different. I decided to spend the night studying again, very decidedly *not* taking any of the coffee this time, slightly annoyed that I would likely regret it in the middle of the next morning's final. 



I didn’t. 



Nothing had changed. And now, I was starting to get concerned. 



Did I have some adverse reaction or something? What was going *on?* I called my mom to ask what she had to say. She was equally concerned for my well-being and suggested I take a trip to the university's health center.



The best they could do for me was recommend I take some medication and see if that fixed it and instructed me to call a doctor if it didn't.



Their suggestion didn’t help.



Not only that, but as I lay awake for hours, a chill sweat began to trickle down my skin. It started gradually, but it eventually became intense, such that my sheets quickly became drenched in the stuff. My head as well… was *throbbing; a piercing*, screaming headache shot its way through my brain, only getting worse. It was as if I had just been shot. 



There was a different kind of thumping in the head, though… one much more unexplainable. On top of the raging headache, I felt something else—a tiny, slight, unrhythmic tapping… seeming to occur at different parts of my brain. I paid close attention as it slowly moved from one side of my forehead to the other, then around the back of the skull before continuing to wrap itself around. 



I didn’t know what to make of it. And that’s also where I drew the line.



Enough was enough. 



I was calling a doctor tomorrow. 



Well, I did that the following morning, and the response I got was something like, ""Sorry, the best we can do is give you an appointment in two weeks.""



*Great.* 



All praise the healthcare system, I guess. 



But I did the only thing I could: I said, ""Okay,"" booked the meeting, and hoped it wouldn't worsen.



The following day was when things started to get a little scary. My mother nearly gasped when she saw me on facetime. Saying that I looked ""Paler than snow .""



I had to agree with her because, in the middle of our conversation, I got a sudden wave of extreme nausea, gagging harder than I ever had before. I hastily hung up the call and sprinted to the bathroom, just in time to empty my stomach contents into the toilet bowl. I sat there, retching for the next hour. All the while, the headache and those odd irregular feelings circling themselves around my brain continued.



And if that wasn’t bad enough, as I was donating my insides to the indoor plumbing, I swear I saw something move in the corner of my eye. It was brief… but it looked like an… odd elongated shape slowly moving up the bathroom wall. I didn't get a good look at it, as it appeared to hurry out of view entirely before I turned around.



I searched the entire place, top to bottom, but there was no sign of the damn thing. It was like it had just… vanished… 



That was the final straw. 



I assumed the sleep deprivation was getting to me, and I was beginning to hallucinate, even though I still felt as awake as ever. But I didn't care anymore. Enough was enough; I could not, in any way, wait *two* *weeks* for an appointment. 



And so without any options left, I picked up the phone and dialed 9-1-1. 



The paramedics arrived within minutes, and I quickly explained the situation to them, and, after seeing how terrible I looked, they immediately put me on a stretcher and whisked me away to the local hospital. 



The two-hour wait in the emergency room was what I could best describe as miserable. I was stuck sitting on cheap plastic chairs in a sanitary, lit open room surrounded by patients suffering from god knows what illness. The icing on the cake was that my symptoms continued to worsen throughout my entire stay. 



My vision was beginning to go hazy, and I swear I kept seeing something move in my peripheral vision, like that thing I found back in my apartment. 



Finally, after hours of torture, The doctor finally called me and escorted me to my new room. He introduced himself as Dr. Jones and ran me through some basic questions, you know, the typical stuff.



“How are you feeling, Kevin?”



“Terrible.”



“Have you taken any drugs recently?”



“Other than Nyquil? No…”



“Do you drink any alcohol? ” 



“Very rarely.” 



It was just your standard, run-of-the-mill doctor's questioning, but soon, one toward the end caught my attention. 



“Did you drink any caffeinated beverages recently?” The doctor asked.

I stopped for a moment. ""...I mean, I *did* have a shot of coffee… but it was… three… four days ago?""



The doctor made a hum of acknowledgment, his expression considerate before shaking it off. ""Okay… well, that shouldn't be causing this then… I'm going, to be honest with you, Kevin: I'm not sure what's happening… So what we're going to do now is run you through a few tests to hopefully determine an answer…and if we can't find anything… then we might have to keep you here overnight to perform a sleep test.""



I snorted.



*Sleep test… right…* 



The preliminary tests went exactly as expected. They took some blood, checked my blood pressure, and looked at my heart rate—all the standard stuff. Everything turned out negative for any sort of issue. My vitals were perfect… frustratingly so. 



He then informed me they would proceed with the sleep test that night. They escorted me to a place that looked more like a hotel room than a hospital. A big window at the far end would let in plenty of natural light during the day, another blurred-out window on the right side, and a neat little old-fashioned lamp stood on a nightstand. The bed itself looked rather cozy and had a lovely wooden finish as a headboard. If I weren't so ill, I would've admired it. 



After hooking me up to various pieces of equipment that I couldn’t even explain the purpose of Dr. Jones spoke again. ""Alright… you're all set up, Kevin. Now, don't worry. We're going to be watching from the adjacent room the entire night, okay? So if you need anything… just ask.""



I nodded my head, the only response I could make in my current state, and watched as he handed me a couple of pills. 



""Oh, and one more thing, here is some Silenor for the night… it's an insomnia medication; it should be more powerful than the stuff you had before… Hopefully, it might have an effect."" 



After I swallowed what he had given me, the doctor made his way out of the room and shut off the lights before closing the door. And just like that, I was left with nothing but complete, overbearing silence, broken only by the gentle hum of machinery. 



The whole place was pitch black, as my eyes hadn't adjusted yet. I gently eased my head back into the pillow and closed them, hoping to finally catch some Zs. The bed was really comfortable; in any other situation, I would've fallen asleep within minutes. 



But now… 



One hour passed…



Two hours passed…



I was beginning to get frustrated. I still did not feel tired in the slightest, and it seemed that the tablet the doctor had given me wasn't helping. So I just lay there, staring at the ceiling for some time and holding my eyes shut.



Nothing happened until about midnight, and quite frankly, I wish it had stayed that way. I immediately felt the throbbing in my head return, and the gentle taps that seemed to be circulating around my entire head went into overdrive. It was more evenly spread now, too. Rather than being in specific locations, it was across what seemed to be the entire circumference of my brain all at once. I could almost*...hear…*it inside me, all the little taps… like crinkling paper.



I sprung up to a sitting position, clutching my face in pain. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness now; what was once pure nothingness had brightened into a shadowy cacophony that ate the corners and walls of the room. The nausea returned, and stars pulsated through my vision, and just then… something caught my eye. 



It sounded in my ears too…coming from the dark, shadowy corner that lay just to the left of me…running smoothly and slowly up the wall. 



I looked over to the source of the noise, which was partially illuminated by the glow of the machinery, and what I saw made my heart drop. Tucked away where the left and back wall met each other was what appeared to be a black, slim, elongated tube of some sort… but no, it wasn't that. I peered closer at it, and I realized the thing had legs… hundreds and hundreds of little tiny legs squirming and latching onto the wall in unison with the noise. 



The thing slowly crawled its way up the room, paying me no attention. Its long body squirmed and wriggled in perfect harmony as it made its way towards the ceiling. 

 I stayed frozen in fear for a few seconds before I immediately launched up from my bed and screamed, practically ripping all the equipment down from where it was standing, unleashing a loud crash.



The doctors stormed into the room and immediately turned on the lights, demanding to know what had happened. I was hysterical. My head was still pounding, it felt like my brain was constrained.



""The-There's something in the corner of the-""



But as I looked to point it out, what I had seen was gone. 



“Kevin… How long did you say you were awake for…?” Dr. Jones asked with concern. “It’s common with severe sleep deprivation that you may experience hallucinations… ”



It made sense, but what I had seen felt so... life-like… I knew that even if this was a hallucination, this wasn't your average run-of-the-mill seeing things. This was… much… deeper. 



The doctors informed me that they would have to cancel the sleep test because my ruckus of throwing everything to the floor managed to break the equipment I was strapped to, so… *yay me*. 



However, They said that they could retrieve all the data up until now and that they would be able to review it as soon as possible. They quickly decided it would be best to move me to a standard hospital room while they awaited my results, but they could barely move me five feet before I started gagging and spilled my stomach contents all over the floor. 



It was then that I finally got a good look at what was coming out of me. It was filled with what looked like… tiny black spheres… I didn't know what to make of it; quite frankly, I was worrying about other things, but it seemed to stun the doctors for a moment, too. However, they quickly got back to the task and escorted me out into the hallway. I didn't see what became of my mess afterward. 



After getting into an admittedly less comfortable hospital bed, I finally had the opportunity to scroll through my phone. It was completely blown up with panicked messages from my mother asking me what was happening and demanding to know why I wasn't answering. I called her back, and the second she saw the medical bed behind me, she nearly exploded into tears. 



“What happened?!” She cried out. 



I explained everything that had been going on since I last called her: the sudden wave of nausea I experienced, calling 9-1-1, and the sleep test. We, or rather, she, came to the conclusion that she would fly down and visit me as soon as possible to hopefully get this whole situation sorted. It was… nice… a silver lining in all this awfulness. At the very least, I was going to be able to see my mother again. 



Doctor Jones interrupted our conversation. After I said one last goodbye to my mother, Jones simply sat down and sighed. He was holding what looked to be a couple of sheets of paper in his hand. 



""Hey, Kevin…"" He started. ""So we've been reviewing your sleep test data as promised, and well…"" He showed me what looked to be a graph with a long squiggly line complete with small valleys and ever-towering hills. ""Your brain waves… they're highly irregular…look."" He began tracing his finger along the figure. ""They are much more active than they should be, even while you're awake… and they nearly go off the graph here when you had your… episode… It's highly alarming."" 



I stared at him in silence, not knowing exactly what to say. ""One thing's for sure; we're going to have to get a head CT done as soon as possible… I'll see how soon I can get you in for an appointment…""



I could barely utter an okay before he left the room, and finally… I completely broke down. This whole thing… It was a massive nightmare. I had no idea why this was happening, and it seemed like even the doctors, the world-class professionals, did not have any semblance of a clue either. I just wanted this all to end; I just wanted to get some sleep finally. I tried to stop… *seeing* that thing in the corner of my eye. But alas, I should’ve known my prayers would all fall on deaf ears. 



A few hours later, Doctor Jones returned and escorted me to the head examination room. It was small and white, with what looked to be some sort of control desk behind a wall in the front and a large machine resembling an MRI taking up most of the space. The machine was making a lot of noise, far more than I had expected.



I lay down on the little bed, feet facing the device and put arms over my head, as the assistant wheeled me into it. I can't lie; I had a certain amount of dread come over me. I knew this was all normal procedure and that it was going to be painless, but something about this was daunting to me. 



Dr. Jones and the others returned to the control area near the entrance and advised me the scan was about to begin. However, I didn't even make it for what seemed like five seconds when there appeared to be distress from the control center, and one of the assistants practically ran out of the room.



My heart began to pound  in my chest as I wondered what was wrong.



Dr. Jones approached me immediately, a grim expression on his face. 



""Listen Kevin…"" He sighed. ""Normally, CT scan results take weeks to get back to you, but we've seen some things here that I believe might have to be taken care of *now.”* 



He ushered me back to the area he had been in during the process and pointed at the computer screen, and I nearly gasped when I saw the image being projected. There was a picture of my head, which was to be expected, but there was something else. Wrapped around it was a long, bug-like creature with two big antennas at the front and an uncountable amount of legs; the whole thing bare resemblance to a giant millipede, yet it was slightly fatter and was long enough to cover the entire circumference of the brain twice. There was something else, though; that… creature… looked precisely like the one I had been seeing in my hallucinations, albeit a bit smaller. 



My heart lurched in my chest as I stared at the unnerving image. I was feeling sick to my stomach, but not due to the illness this time. 



“What the *hell?!”* I exclaimed. 



""Yeah…"" Dr. Jones commented. ""I have no idea where this came from; I've never seen anything like it before… but we're going to have to get that thing out of you pretty fast.""



I could only bob my head in agreement, still lost in my thoughts. This… thing… had been sitting inside me for god knows how long… was *that* what I felt when I experienced that tapping inside my head…? was it that thing… *crawling around up there?* 



As if on cue, it started again, circling all around me. I paid closer attention this time, and I could really feel it—all those little legs skittering along my head. I immediately dissolved into a blind panic, but that seemed to make it pick up the pace. 



It almost seemed… excited… or stimulated in some way. 



My headache returned, and I collapsed to the ground, my fear briefly forgotten. Doctor Jones stood up to help me back to my feet and looked at me with a concerned expression. 



""Look, Kevin… I'll try to schedule surgery to get this thing removed as soon as possible… until then… just try not to think about it too hard… okay?""  



*Don't think about it too hard.*



That was easier said than done; how was I supposed to go back to my room and pretend this *thing* hadn't just made its home up there? My terror got worse as I was ushered back to my room. I still felt it the whole time… it had gotten active recently, and my symptoms were starting to flare up again. 



I was overwhelmed with illness the second I got back into my hospital room and immediately sprinted toward the bathroom. The substance I excreted looked the same as before… filled with those… weird black spheres. 



I didn't pay attention to it, though. I was still thinking about that *thing.* It had been real… maybe my visions hadn't been—but that thing had been living inside me this whole time. I tried… desperately to calm myself down and tell myself it would be out in a day. It didn't make it any better. 



After finishing my rounds, I got up weakly and stared at myself in the mirror. 



And that’s when I saw it. 



Slightly above my eyebrows, in the middle of my forehead, was what appeared to be a massive bulge. It sat there, completely still. As I looked at it further, I realized it wasn't just that… It was a long, winding… bug-like cylinder that circled itself around my entire head. I could even see the pieces of my hair slightly displaced by the thing as it sheathed beneath them.



I don't know what came over me. But somehow, all worry and tension immediately disappeared. I found my right hand slowly drifting up towards my scalp as if it had a mind of its own. I'd say I tried to stop it, but that would be a lie. It was almost like… like I was in some sort of trance. My mind had gone completely blank as my arm slowly hovered up further toward the anomaly.



Then… I touched it and squeezed it gently. It was soft to the touch, almost like some sort of sponge, but I didn't have much time to register it as it immediately squirmed away, darting out of view and behind my head at a speed that looked similar to a bullet fired from a gun. 



This is what finally ripped me from my state. 



I screamed and leaped backward, almost splitting my head on the bathroom tiles. I sat there breathing heavily for a moment, hyperventilating, nearly crying before I worked up the courage to look back into the mirror.



It was gone. 



I did a complete 360 to make sure, but no matter what angle I checked… it wasn't there anymore. 



My headache intensified once again, and I ran to my bed, curling up in the fetal position, tears streaming from my eyes. I remained like that for hours. The doctors had come in to check on me to see what was wrong… but after I explained what I had seen, they found nothing. Still, their presence helped calm me down a tiny bit. 



That night, I simply lay staring at the ceiling. I don’t think I would’ve been able to sleep even if I didn’t have this odd condition. 



Nothing else happened. But still, it was bad enough. The image of what I saw on the CT scan and what happened to me later in that bathroom was *haunting.* And no matter how hard I tried, I simply could not get that thing out of my head. 



My mom arrived the following morning, and I explained everything to her. She was understandably just about as freaked out as I was, but she relaxed a tad bit when I told her about the doctor's plans to remove what was now being confirmed as a parasite clinging to my brain. 

  


My neurosurgeon, with a team of doctors, an assistant, and my anesthesiologist, came in a few minutes later, announcing that it was time to perform the surgery, and told my parents to remain in the waiting room. With one last hug goodbye we split up, hopefully to see eachother again once this was over. 



""Don't worry. I'm going to take good care of you,"" my anesthesiologist reassured me as she prepared the machine. 



Bright, blinding lights sprang to life as the doctors prepared their tools and laid them out on the table next to me. I knew I wouldn't be feeling any of this, but still, I have to admit, it did give me a small pit in my stomach to see all of the sharp objects that were about to be used.



They stuck an I.V. into my arm and hooked me up to all kinds of equipment, including heart rate and blood pressure monitors. I listened as the rhythmic beeping sprang to life and I tried to ease myself, staring into the piercing lights above. 



""Okay, Kevin,"" my anesthesiologist smiled. Once I set this mask on your face, I want you to count down from ten in your head. I promise you will be asleep before you reach zero.""



With that, she gently placed it over my nose, and I slowly breathed in the chemicals streaming through the tube, and then did as she requested.



I reached the end of my ten-second countdown. I was still awake. I began to worry; nothing around me had changed. I tried to say something, to get up and tell the doctors that I was still there, but the second I tried to move, I realized I couldn't. I was locked in place, bound to the table, completely paralyzed. I couldn't even do so much as wiggle my fingers. 



My heart beat faster in my chest as I looked over at the anesthesiologist who was monitoring my heart rate and other vitals, and thankfully, she seemed to realize something was wrong, too. 



""He's awake,"" she said bluntly, slightly confused as she stared at the monitors in front of her. Don't start yet; I'm going to increase the dosage.""



She turned some nob on the machine connected to my mask, and all of a sudden, I felt an intense surge of the stuff get pushed through the tube, far more potent than it was before, forcing itself into my nose. My paralysis was getting stronger, but I still was not falling asleep. 



I began to panic, as evidenced by the ever-increasing beeping on the monitor beside me. The anesthesiologist started to swear under her breath as she turned the dial up even more, almost bringing it to its max. But nothing was working. I lay there, awake on the table, unable to do or say anything, while the doctors all crowded around me, trying to get me to go under. 



Suddenly, the lights above me went out, and the room went completely dark. All the medical staff blurred into the sides of my vision, still and unmoving. What was once a soundscape filled with the frantic movement of personnel and nurses and the rapid beeping of the heart rate monitor was replaced with complete and utter silence. 



I sat there, breathing heavily, and that thing began to scurry again, rushing as I felt it crawl all around my head. I wanted to throw up. It was incredibly disgusting, and it just wouldn't *stop.* 



There was something else, though. A couple of minutes passed, and something crept through the silence. A soft but noticeable crackling noise came from the far end of the room, something I couldn't see from here, slowly making its way ever closer. 



I stared into the distance in terror as the sound unmistakably began wiggling its way up the foot of the bed before changing slightly, now sounding like small, tiny micro taps on plastic.



It wasn't long before two creepy small antennas became barely visible, peering through the darkness, just into view. A couple seconds later, the head arrived. It was that… *thing…* the same creature I had seen on the CT scan, although it looked much larger.



It continued to work its way up the end of my bed and slithered its way down the other side. I tried to get up, to run, but the paralysis drug that the anesthesiologist had given me was doing its job; I was still stuck, still unable to move. I was left helpless, only able to watch in horror as the thing slowly squirmed its way over onto the bed and up onto my foot. 



The small pins of hundreds of tiny little appendages gently reached my leg. The thing was relaxed, seemingly unphased by all my struggles, as it got closer and closer, gently wrapping its way around my limb. I could look at it now; it definitely resembled a massive millipede, but no exoskeleton existed. Instead, what made up the body seemed to be a pale fleshy mass laced with a pattern of black marks strewn across the entire thing.



It reached my stomach and made a straight beeline for my face. I tried as hard as I could to hold my head back and keep it as far away from this thing as possible, but it was futile. All the while, the back half of it had just crossed over the far bed frame, and I was beginning to feel its writhing tingles all over my body. 



My eyes began watering as it slowly crawled on top of my neck and made contact with my chin, its long antennas now taking up a good chunk of my vision. It was then that I realized that I didn't seem to be wearing my mask anymore. I don't know when it disappeared, but it was missing, which gave that thing the opportunity to reach between my lips with its little front legs and slowly pry open my mouth with a strength I wouldn't believe it had. 



I tried again in vain to turn my head to do *something* to counteract it, but nothing worked. The only movements I made was me shaking like a leaf with the events that were currently transpiring. 



Once the creature had opened my mouth just enough, I gagged as it slowly began to crawl its way inside; I felt every movement of the tiny bug limbs creeping on my tongue, the fleshy mass of a body slowly rubbing against the top of my mouth. I wanted to throw up so badly, to cough, but for some reason, those reflexes weren't working; all I could do was gag over and over again as its long, segmented body maneuvered its way in like a snake shedding its skin.



The head reached the back of my throat and began to work its way up towards the top of my head. As I watched more and more of its body disappear behind my lips, I heard the sound of and then saw more and more of these creatures. Smaller ones began to appear at the sides of the bed and weave their way towards me. Some crawled toward my face; others maneuvered themselves across every square inch of my body. 



I tried to scream, but nothing came out. I began hyperventilating, looking at the scene in front of me with terror; each time I looked, there were more and more of them, seemingly appearing out of thin air, exploring every little nook and cranny of me. A pounding throbbing headache ensued, and above all that I felt that thing, the original parasite, continue to crawl its way around in my brain faster than it ever had before.



I squeezed my eyes shut, praying for the nightmare to end and then finally. After what felt like forever, it did. 



The lights above me blared to life, and I launched out of the bed and let out a shriek as I failed my arms around. I nearly smacked the hand of the anesthesiologist dead on as she immediately grabbed hold of my shoulders, trying to ease me back into the bed.



“Easy… easy…” She said 



I wanted to yell at her, but then I realized… everything I had just seen, all those bugs… those *things.* They were gone. It was just me and the doctors in an operating room with a highly rapid heartbeat monitor. 



I took a second to collect my bearings and looked at the mask sitting on the bedside table; they had taken me off the medication. 



I instantly collapsed into tears and begged for my mother.



""We're going to have to try something else…"" One doctor said, ""Removing it isn't going to work if we can't get him under."" 



I nearly tackled my mom when I saw her again and explained everything about my horrible experience in that operating room. 



Dr. Jones came in a couple of minutes later, with a grim expression. ""Listen Kevin… I am sorry about what you just went through. For now, we've decided that we're going to try and give you some anti-parasitic medication and see if that will help your condition. I'd hate to tell you this, but the medical staff is… a little lost right now because you've been infected with a parasite species we've never seen before, so we'll call in some researchers to better understand your condition. 



My mother immediately stood up in protest. “You are *not* going to run experiments on my son!”



Dr. Jones simply looked at her with professionalism. ""They aren't experiments, ma'am… we're just going to study the best course of action to hopefully kill or get this thing out of him. And besides, it's Kevin's choice…""



They both looked at me, and I sighed. I desperately wanted this as far away from me as humanly possible, and so, with nothing left to lose, I accepted. 



The next seven days, my condition didn't get much better. I had been awake for thirteen days at this point. But it was weird because despite how horrible I felt, I still didn’t  need to sleep. I still felt as awake as since this whole thing had begun, and at this point, I had resigned myself to not feeling sleepy ever again until this whole thing was over. 



I requested to spend my nights with my mother because, after my surgery encounter, I didn't want to be lying in my room alone at night, and the presence of my folks helped put me at ease. They even taught me to laugh about it all a little, and as time went on, mysteriously, the hallucinations became slightly more diluted, something which the researchers quickly picked up.



Oh yeah, at this point, I was also being watched by a team of researchers 24/7. I was doing constant tests, scans, the whole deal.



The anti-parasitics they were trying seemed to have no effect. I guess they just hadn't invented one that worked for this specific species yet. 



The next day. One of the researchers came in and told me he had an idea. My symptoms seemed to calm down when I was at a state of ease and flare up when I was stressed or scared so he proposed giving me a high dose of ketoconazole, a medication that's supposed to regulate my stress hormones. 



I tried it for two days, and the scientists' theories were all but confirmed because my hallucinations and all my other symptoms weakened significantly. A subsequent CT scan revealed the thing had grown much smaller than it was before… it was starving. This is what led to the current theory that this thing likely feeds off of stress hormones or other things your body produces during these periods. 



They continued this pattern for the next two days until my symptoms became so mild they almost didn't exist anymore. I was still stuck awake, but everything else had been diluted to an absolute minimum; the parasite on the CT scan looked like a shriveled husk of what it used to be. 



Dr. Jones came into the room that day and delivered a message that almost made my stomach drop. He said that, if possible, he would like to try the surgery again, given that the thing had gotten so weak that the researchers didn't think it could overpower the anesthesia as it did before. 



I halted for a moment; on the one hand, I was eager to be done with this, but on the other… I didn't want to relive what I had before. Dr. Jones assured me that they would be starting with a very low dose, and if they didn't notice an effect, they would immediately call off the operation. 



After a long debate between my parents and the doctors, we decided to proceed. 



Thankfully, the surgery went off without a hitch. 



When I came too, I finally saw the thing that had caused me all this trouble with my own eyes; it was dead, lying on the bedside table fully stretched out. It looked the same as what I saw in my hallucinations, albeit a lot smaller. 



I even got to name the damn thing. ""Neural Sleep Parasite"" Had an excellent ring to it. Before long, they hauled off that thing for further study, and I never saw it again. 



They explained to me that I had most likely ingested its eggs when drinking that coffee back in the library, and that, combined with the high-stress response, allowed it to sort of take over my brain for a while. 



But I cut them off. I didn't want to hear more about this. I was done. 



Or so I thought. 



Because immediately after a big scare I will not get into and jumping under covers back home… my tiredness… vanished…



I began to panic but forced myself to think clearly. 



They said I ingested its eggs with that coffee… what if there was more than one… or what if it had laid more while it was inside me? Come to think of it, those odd black spheres coming out of me all the time were… unsettling; I just never thought to bring it up because there was always something else of critical importance happening…



I’m writing this now with a piercing headache, as all of my symptoms are beginning to rush back.

We have two 20 amp outlets on the same circuit in our kitchen. One our fridge is plugged with into and the other has our air fryer, coffee maker & electric kettle plugged in. (There's another outlet on the circuit that's not used regularly.) Lately when using the air fryer the display would flicker and the device it self would flicker like it's having power problems. We just assumed it was a shitty air fryer and started looking for a new one. Flash forward to a few weeks ago and it did it again but then shut off entirely and everything else on that circuit lost power. My husband went to check the breaker box and the breaker wasn't tripped. He flipped it off and thought maybe he heard a sizzling noise but he's not sure. He then checked all the outlets on the circuit and when he took the one the air fryer etc is plugged into off, he noticed the ground was loose so he fixed it. When he turned the breaker back on, everything was on and working so he figured the loose ground was the issue. He rechecked all the outlets with a multimeter and got 120v AC on all of them.  Things worked fine for a few weeks so we thought the issue was fixed but it happened again tonight. What could be causing the issue? He is planning on ordering a new breaker and replacing it tomorrow for that circuit but it can't be that simple can it? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

————————————————————————

It was a strange sensation. The crow had been living in the fade for months now, but hadn’t experienced any dreams. 

He had to admit that was partially his own doing, forcing himself to stay awake with discipline, coffee, and the sheer spite he held for his unwelcome demon. And though he wouldn’t admit it out loud to anyone else but her…fear. 

Of course there was only so much he could do to stave off the exhaustion. He may be the Demon of Vyrantium, but even he couldn’t conquer sleep and would lose consciousness. During those times he experienced nothing. No darkness or calm, but lapses of time. One moment he was awake writing his in his log or sharpening his blades, the next he would be in another place entirely. He’d gasp for air and have a searing headache. Mierda, did Spite not breathe when he possessed him?! Was it because he was demon who didn’t need to breathe, or was it out of pure spite to torture him like this as punishment for not letting him out. 

Whatever the case, Lucanis hated the sensation whenever it happened. He’d managed it for a year dealing with Spite. The demon was persistent, but he found ways to keep him at bay. Usually by ignoring his presence unless it was necessary. Things were different now though. He no longer felt that he needed to keep Spite in check as often. The demon had lessened his possession attempts of late. Lucanis even found himself more open to engaging with him too now that they understood one another better. He had to admit that Spite was much easier to tolerate than he’d expected. Perhaps it was thanks to her influence on the both of them. She had done the unthinkable getting them closer to one mind. It seemed the demon had become calmer whenever she was around to humor him as well. 

Spite was still mischievous of course. Often pestering and whining to him about when the next time she’d come around the pantry for a visit. Spite would also on occasion, get excited randomly and tease Lucanis with new vulgarities the he’d had picked up. Although it annoyed him, Lucanis couldn’t exactly get angry at the demon. Spite was after all, feeding off his own unconscious thoughts and feelings. It was his own desires being thrown back at his face and made him all the more flustered. It was even worse when she started to pick up on them too. 

Somehow, despite not hearing or seeing the demon, the two somehow managed to bond over pushing his buttons. There were times he even suspected that perhaps they were  conspiring with one another. But he knew better than to assume that. Rook was just too observant for her own good. She was good at seeing right through people, especially him, and he didn’t quite know how to handle that yet.

Lucanis, however, was still grateful for this strange arrangement the three of them shared. He found himself feeling much more at ease. More relaxed  than he had felt in a long time. When Spite did take over, it wasn’t exactly pleasant, but the lapses didn’t hurt as much.  He also got to look forward to Rook’s company keeping him grounded afterward. 

But this was different. There was no lapse. This time he was conscious, or at least he thought so? 

He felt off balance and disoriented. It was as if his body was suspended in the air, hanging from unseen strings. His senses dulled. He couldn’t move or speak, but could see and feel. The air around him felt dense, his vision hazy as if looking through a thick fog. It unnerved him how much his senses were subdued by these strange surroundings. Was this the fade? 

What did come through clearly was a scream.

“LET ME OUT!”

Lucanis could hear Spite roaring from behind him. A chained beast lashing out against his restraints. A strange sensation washed over him as he felt a sudden force pushing him back. It nearly knocked the wind out of him. 

“SHE’S STUCK! LET. ME. FIND. HER!”

The pressure became more intense. He could also hear a mix of other familiar voices as well, but they were distant and harder to hear. These voices sounded as if they were struggling against something, desperately trying to keep something contained. They were nearly drowned out by Spite’s ravings. 

“GET OFF ME!”

“Hurry up! Hold him down!”

The pressure shifted and the crow felt as if hands were gripped tightly on his shoulders, pushing him down on his back. Instinctually he tried to break from the grip but found he had no strength. 

“WE NEED HER!”

“He’s stronger than he looks! Bellara I don’t know how much longer we can keep this up!”

“WE NEED ROOK!”

“Hold him still!”

“NOT GOING BACK!”

A new sensation wrapped around his wrists tightly. Whatever it was, it was painful and tightened as the voices grew louder. He wanted to scream. Tell them to stop, but his voice betrayed him as he made no sound. 

“Taash do something!”

“NOT ALONE AGAIN!”

“Can’t you see I’m fu—ing trying!?”

“YOU WON’T HOLD ME BACK!”

“Almost there!”

Now his legs were restrained and he could feel the same tightening grips around his ankles. He felt as if he were being pulled apart! His voice again would not come out! When would it stop?!

“GET OFF!”

“Emmrich do it now!”

Then there was silence and all went dark…

So, I live only with my mother and I’m pretty close with her I guess. I eat all the time when she is at home. But, I’ve noticed whenever I go out with friends, I can barely eat. An example from a day ago is when I went out for lunch with a friend. I was at their apartment and we were watching a movie. While doing so, we ordered a large pizza and some breaded mushroom things. I was very hungry since I had breakfast 3 or 4 hours ago and the only other food I had in the mean time was a single Little Debbie Honey Bun with half a cup of coffee. When we got the food, I was able to eat the first slice just fine and a couple of the mushrooms. However, once I started eating a second slice, I could barely finish it. Since my issue with not being able to finish food would happen in the past, I would think about it again and I started to feel a knot in my stomach. I felt not sick enough that I wanted to throw up but just uncomfortable, like I needed to get some fresh air or something. For the entire 2 hours of watching the movie, I was just sitting there in discomfort, constantly thinking about the food. At that point, even the smell of the food started to make me feel ill. After the movie was finished, I went to bathroom and I couldn’t help but just keep coughing. This sort of thing always happens when I eat around people except my mother. I can’t understand why and it’s becoming really annoying. It’s hard to go out with friends because I start worrying about eating and the thought of eating starts to already make me feel anxious. Does anyone have a similar issue or is this something related to some besides anxiety or stress. I guess I should also mention I have OCD and I have a fast metabolism. I thought I should mention these things if they’re related possibly.",1,1731810883.0,Anxietyhelp,1,1.0,False

I was 70 yo and figured, after a few short-term arrangements via SA, that my SD days were about over. I had regular morning coffee at a Waffle House near my home. My waitress most mornings was a cute 24 yo single mom. We talked mostly about the difficulties of a single parent (I was a single Dad). One morning I said she was so cute I would like to adopt her. She said she had a father. I said that was okay because I wanted to be her daddy. She knew immediately what I meant. We agreed to meet for drinks and dinner the next weekend when her ex had the kids. She was my SB for almost two years.

If you want to freestyle….be personable, don’t rush, listen to her for a common experience and an opening. Do not be shy. Tell her what you want and why. 

Last but not least, the older I get the easier it is to freestyle. Maybe the ladies think I am less of a threat, or less demanding, or more like their dad (or granddad). But I think it is mostly because I am open, honest, and not concerned if I get rejected. And I am generous, but not extravagant. That counts too.

“What the heck?  What the fuck?  When?  sputters Maria as her eyes follow her son’s direction.  “If you told me earlier, I’d’ve been here earlier,” and that, dear MIL, had that been a question, would have been self-explanatory.  She’s not angry because “God doesn’t make mistakes” unlike her paternity test gift to Justine so now she knows this is her do-over.  But with Maria’s arrival, the forecast is partly sunny with clouds moving in for a decent chance of rain on someone’s parade.  Justine suspects Maria has something up her sweatered sleeve and she might be right as Maria swears never to contradict her or disrespect her . . . in front of the kids.  Around the darkened corner, however, “if things don’t go the right way, I’m going to step in.”  But as she reaches for the laundry, DIL steps in with her house rules and how she likes things done and that’s a good time to ask the burning question, “Whose idea was it to keep a secret from me”?  What a damned-if-you-do and dead-if-you-don’t speed bump so easily sidestepped moment.  And it is, segueing into Sherry’s probable reaction whose rocky history with her daughter’s impetuous decisions and Montana’s, “The plan is just to leave it in God’s hands” understandably elicits a WTF throwing-hands-up-in-the-air stalking off reaction.  It’s been nice living on the other side of the country.  Death can wait for a final halcyon delivery.  *I’m not saying you have too many kids, but it’s a vagina, not a clown car.*   

**Tantrum  Tarantula  Trauma  Titty-lating?**

No coffee serving, no rides, and no back rubs – Daniel’s life will be death by a thousand little cuts, and to add insult to injury, Bianca is cooking eggs vigorously without any fats not allowing the heat to denature the unfolded proteins to bind and curdle. While he gags, bravely trying to down the superfood’s nutrients, the chef chides him for being unappreciative of anything she does.  She scrapes the eggs off the plate and into the trash paralleling her treatment of Daniel, and guess what?  Hailey is coming to visit.  Tomorrow.  “Is it ok”?  “It’s kinda’ late.""  What can I expect”?  Doing the dishes.  Again.   Never mind.  They’re going on a double date with Conner, “Gator” as he’s known in the yard, and his enviable officially engaged-with-a-ring, for there is no other way to be engaged, fiancée, Celeste (unaccountably pronounced Celes-tay). 

First things first.  Daniel’s idea of lovemaking being two perfunctory kisses and a thuggish positioning of Bianca’s body to jackhammer her somewhere in the conjunction of the vulva above the urethra.  Finding the clitoris is harder than finding Waldo.  It’s a *maize* down there like trying to find shell-less littleneck clams in a tangle of spaghetti or picking those pesky hidden raisins in an otherwise lovely rice pudding.  Why, a man needs a AAA treasure map to mark the route from base camp A to X marks the spot, but that’s not quite what Kimber, the Somatic Intimacy Coach has in mind.  She is that prototypical middle-aged New Agey-looking woman wearing Native American turquoise and beads signaling her oneness with the universe.  Her mini gallery wall framed by the names and functions of The Vestibular Glands and The Labia fascinates Daniel.  Their goal: better sex = more physical and emotional intimacy and less crises, but instead of following the yellow brick road to Oz, he and Bianca are seated on the floor straddling each other asking and answering the same questions with a thank you for each answer.  “What do you desire?  “Better sex.”  “You being ok with me doing the little things that bother you.”  “Huh, I don’t even know what that means.”  (Nor do I.)  Moving on.  “What are you afraid of?  You leaving me and my drinking affecting our relationship.”  “You never seeing the potential I see in you.”  “What do you love about me?  “Your abs, your strength;” “How passionate you are about your writing.  Your letters to me in prison got me through tough times and to the love that brought us here.”  “What is your relationship status?  Boyfriend/girlfriend.”  “No.”  “Yes, because if you were engaged, you’d have a ring on your finger.”  “You asked me to marry you while you were in prison, though.”  “I did and meant it then; but now, fiancée doesn’t sit right.”

After that there should’ve been a tantric workshop afterglow; however, the couple finds their way to Mill’s Modern Social for a double date night, and right off the bat Conner’s sense of humor and unsolicited but smart advice prompts a “Not a fan of Gator” remark.  While the two women repair to the bar where the predictable cran vodka ameliorates Bianca’s throat, so her venting slides off more smoothly, Gator explains that he didn’t propose until their second anniversary.  He advises Daniel to consider the age gap, their mutual expectations, and a trial living together to ensure their mutual commitment because he immediately clocked her and his advice was, “You need to fucking run, dude!”  *Keep pouring bartender, it’s still Monday.*         

**It’s Ok If You Don’t Like Me; Not Everyone Has Good Taste**

Louie knows his woman as well as he knows his pizza.  Melissa wants to shout her engagement from the rooftops and let the rainbow colors and white light flash off her 2-carat diamond as intently as the firestorm of daggers erupting from Donna’s bloodshot eyes at the family dinner soiree Louie has arranged that night at the 26 West on the Navesink on the Jersey shore.    But it’s only those three as well as Melissa's dad, the cadaverous Ron who looks as though a swear word would blow him over.  She and Louie are expecting an abundance of interjectory plaudits, but crickets except for Donna’s low-key, “Yo, dude, what is this”? and an unexpected request to take it off for Inspector Gadget’s appraisal.  “Welcome to my family,” she says with an eye-roll pun that couldn’t be any cornea.  Donna might not be showing any emotion on the outside, but she’s exploding on the inside.  Yes, she’s happy for them, but she’s unhappy her son is being led away like Delilah did Samson and Eve did Adam although, technically it's already happened.  Louie tries to explain that her and Melissa’s roles are different so there is no competition, and that although her lifelong worry was cultivated through his actions, it’s time for her to let go and relax.  “Why,” she asks.  She tells Melissa, “I spoke with my mother and sister, and they all like you and don’t understand why I don’t like you, but I don’t like you because you’re too much like me,” the several time divorcée, and the ultimate insult even worse than hating her!  Donna praises her son for the man he’s become and then asks, “If you fall, will she support you?  Louie feels guilty; he caused this panic in her, and Melissa doesn’t respond except to turn slightly to the side to reveal the tip of her nose that looks like it was caught in the middle of cookie dough batter starting to be creamed.  *Thou shalt not try me.  Mood 24.7.*

Joey and Kim are inspecting an adequate $215K home with two lots that are $30K more than anticipated with Kim’s $1600 PM salary and a mortgage payment of $1500 PM, not counting a 3.5 % down payment.  What to do?  Why have a yard sale of boys' used shoes and toys AND ask Poppa Edward if they can “borrow” $7K when he drives up wearing shorts because all the $$$ he loaned them didn’t leave him enough to pay for the extra material it would have taken to make his long pants.  Edward is such an easy mark because he loves his daughter and grandsons more than he distrusts Joey, so he inserts the caveat of not putting Joey’s name on the lease.  Now, Joey doesn’t mind working as long as it's work he enjoys and that pays what he considers a decent enough salary for him to dress and leave the house daily - unlike the rest of us who have no choice.

Kim feels bad about using her father as the local ATM, so they go to the Skyla Credit Union to open an account because Kim finally put her foot down on Joey’s unlimited use of her debit card; for that, however, they need identification and credit histories to show Laboris, the bank manager.  Joey can’t find the former and doesn’t have the latter though he has this to say about that: He’s been a responsible drug dealer.  Selling dope is a damn hard job when you’re doing it illegally; not the same as, say for a pharmacist.  Kim wants Joey to get his phone to complete the enrollment and is as curious as to why he left it in the car as his recent behavior, exhaustion, and temperature yo-yo-ing.  While he’s gone, she asks Laboris about dollar limits on a checking account. She can have an overdraft courtesy pay option of $2K daily but that’s too much.  She can get alerts for his transactions which will have to do as much as she’s been tracking everything else about him.  He comes back saying he can’t find his phone and he doesn’t like being controlled, not realizing it’s about the budget, stupid. 

And what does this vaping mushroom t-shirt-wearing clodhopper do right after this but go ‘window shopping’ at the Tint World Styling Center?  (Can you say rims?)   Kim worries now that he may be siphoning off her funds and she fusses at him until he calls Nahim, a sketchy friend from the past, to pick him up, but he returns home plopping into bed and sleeping for 12 hours straight almost missing church.  That leaves time for Kim to confide her concerns to Tammy, his mother, who doesn’t know if her son is on drugs and can only continue praying for him.  If Momma doesn’t know, who does?  When Joey wakes up sick, he only wants to drive himself to Urgent Care although that may mean different things to them both.  He tears away turning off the camera in his car expostulating, “I want to be away and see what’s wrong with me because no one can control what I do.  I gotta do what I gotta do.""  Meanwhile, Kim still proclaims love with every fiber of her being so it will hurt when she picks her children over him because she’s decided to be a parent first.  She might have been more believable had she not introduced this reckless man into their lives at all.  *Okay!!! I’m ready for my next mistake.  Who’s single?  Or married?  Or a man?*

I came out of school at 18 into that shitty 2008 economy, could not get a permanent god damn job in like 9 years i had 9 months with one shop, 3 months with another, 9 months work placement program.      I eventually picked up a job in a fish factory, was sacked on 3rd week \[i sucked and someone else apparently had 10 years experience coming on to replace me\]. asked back 3 weeks later for a week to lend a hand \[i assumed the new contracts where too much for the new guy that replaced me but he had been sacked\] .  . I ultimately ended back there for roughly over 4 years.       the job screwed up my hands \[I suspect carpal tunnel but my nation is IRELAND so 7 - 8 years now still no diagnosis or treatment\]  hands are next to useless, and severe loss of strength in arms also. got so bad had to pack in the job and i loved the job

Ive been unemployed now for 3 years no income, \[because i mentally could not deal with welfare services, so lived off savings. stupid and self destructive but like i say i have issues \]   

applying for shitty jobs like years ago and same shit all over again not even getting interviews. \[bare in mind id been applying for jobs 2 years before i ultimately had to pack in that job in the fish factory. so 5 years, ive had 1 interview in all that time\]

If i had not had to leave that job, id of had 40-50% the price of a home \[would be old home in bad area but would be a secure home all the same\] in savings by now and couldve stood a chance at a mortgage \[im only allowed 70k mortgage by official rules but that couldve been stretched to 120k under special exemption\]       

I do have some mental issues, such as for some god knows reason i have what can only be described as a god damn phobia of tea / coffee and other hot drinks, sight of them makes me uncomfortable. touching a container with them or that has contained them is like mental torture, god forbid i get some on me, i can scrub scrub and scrub the disgust/discomfort lasts an excessively long period of time.        the only option for shit like this tends to be exposure therapy and i tried, it never eased off the issue.    so working as assistant or in a coffee shop or even fast food is not that viable for me, id likely freak the feck out at some point and would be very mentally uncomfortable but ive applied for jobs in fast food and reception / assistant etc all the same as this is life you have to try SUCK IT UP and DEAL WITH SHIT.                 this is obviously a highly embarrassing thing to admit, like phobias of the dark, snakes, dogs, heights those all make god damn sense.  where the hell my discomfort around tea /coffee in particular came from i have no idea and it makes feck all sense. 

Ive always had social anxiety and general anxiety and these are crippling me at the moment, Like i walked into a store there couple weeks back and just had to turn around and walk out, just complete mental breakdown of function / overwhelmed me.      Ive also started to develop a god damn stutter / speech impediment.       Im just hoping if i manage to pick up some work I can hold my shit together. 

thats my pathetic life story thus far. I really wish i could just be better / do better.  Im 34 in a few days and im still living with my parents and making feck all progression in life.      all my issues are my own fault obviously but that doesnt make me feel less shitty.

Although I am very aware at how good ive had things and even when i eventually end up homeless well id be homeless in a western nation, thats still a luxury life compared to the shit a hell of a lot of other people have to put up with in the world.

Our tenth time making the trek—an annual tradition to return to the place where I’d proposed—and she looked as beautiful as she had on the first. 

*Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang*

It was louder now—enveloping us. Desperately I tried to ignore it too—fighting to stay in the moment—fighting to stay with her. I knew what was waiting if I gave in…

*BANG BANG BANG*

“Fuck…”

I opened my eyes, and she was gone. 

And I was back… *there…*

Light bringing no warmth streamed in through the window, and I shivered, uselessly pulling the meager, moth-bitten sheets tighter to my body. 

A full month’s worth of frigid mornings had taught me to expect the chill air forcing its way through the cracks in the crumbling, plaster walls, which brought with it the scent of fresh snow.

“And so continues the endless winter in Hell…” I grumbled, half-awake, as I reached blindly towards the bedside table and wrapped my hand around the glass that I knew would be waiting there—full to the brim with poisonous medicine.

Swallowing its entire contents in two large gulps, I gagged on the flavor of tepid, watered-down, cheap whiskey—potent enough to keep the shakes at bay, yet not quite so strong as to bring any measure of real peace. At least its pain-numbing qualities exceeded those of the booze in the outside world—allowing me to choke back the tears brought on by my shattered back.

*BANG BANG BANG BANG*

The cacophony that had woken me continued down on the first floor. 

From the sound of it, our new arrival was still violently trying to come to terms with his new living arrangements—angrily shouting, pounding on the walls, and, based on the scraping and then the loud crashes that followed, attempting to hurl the dining room chairs through the windows. 

“Henri will be furious about having to rebuild those again…” I murmured. 

I took another swig from the glass that, by then, had refilled itself, and listened more closely to the man’s words. With only two semesters of college Spanish under my belt, it was some time before I recognized anything that he was screaming.

“¡¿Dónde está la puerta?!” was the only thing I picked out that I fully understood. 

‘It will return soon enough.’ I thought to myself, polishing off my second helping of swill, and setting the glass back on the table—feeling the weight of those words more heavily given the events of the last couple days. 

‘Best not focus on that part, though.’ I shuddered, propping my back up against the metal bars of the headboard and reaching once again for my only comfort in *there*—topped off, as it was, for a third time. 

Confined to my bed for the foreseeable future, I heard Henri’s door open and his footsteps thump passed mine as I knew, for the third day in a row, he was going to attempt and calm the fresh tenant. 

And, watching the haggard, dirty, broken man in the mirror that faced the bed raise the glass once again to his lips, I reflected back on my first day in The Winter House. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Two years. 

It was two years to the day that I lost Sherry.

It had all happened so quickly. 

We were on our anniversary hike when, for the first time in our relationship, she fell behind me; then, without warning, collapsed in the middle of the trail.  

Hospital visits, tests, diagnosis, treatment, fighting, losing, withering. 

Dead. 

Six months—that’s all it took. Thirty-seven years of healthy existence, ten years of happy marriage—so much life still left in front of her.

Dead.

Every time I closed my eyes, I could still hear the high-pitched squeal of the machine announcing to me that her heart had stopped when I felt the last of her strength evaporate from the hands I was holding. 

For the next two years, I tried to carry on without her—did everything I knew to pull myself out of the swirling pit of despair I’d dropped into the moment she stopped breathing. Friends, family, hiking, lifting, church—I even debated going to therapy, but my father had always told me that that was only for weak men. 

Every day, I fell deeper into the hole, and every day, the bottle loomed nearer. 

You see, Sherry and I had met in Alcoholics Anonymous. She was already three months sober at the time, and comforted me on my very first day—helped see me through the worst of my detox, kept me going back to meetings, became my biggest advocate. 

We were two broken souls that had enough pieces left to hold each other together, and once she was gone, mine was shattered once more. 

But she had made me promise that I would keep my sobriety in her absence—made me swear it on the ring she’d worn on her hand every day of our marriage, and that I then wore around my neck every day after her passing. 

Yet, one night, I found myself in a bar. 

A bar I’d been to many, many times in my pre-Sherry life. A bar so familiar that, though I hung my head in shame, the feet I was watching carried me to a stool that, even after years of my neglect, still felt like home when I sat in it. And, without me uttering a single word, a drink appeared in front of me. 

Double-whiskey, on the rocks—the bartender winked and asked where I’d been before shuffling off to take another patron’s order. Staring at the ice cubes suspended in the amber pour of my failure, I apologized to Sherry before downing it in one practiced motion. 

Five more helpings of the same tonic at the bar, and a stop at the liquor store on the way home, and I was feeling the best that I had in a long while. In fact, it was the only time in the last two years that I hadn’t felt the crushing weight of Sherry’s death bearing down on my chest, and I was experienced enough to know that the minute I sobered up again, the pain of her loss would return even more intensely than before. 

So, I decided that night, on the walk between the liquor store and my house, that I was never going to be sober again. My plan was to continue drinking in every waking minute of every hour of every day of the remainder of my life, until my liver finally would give out on me.  

And, in that instant, I felt an incredible sense of relief. 

Everything seemed so simple then—I was a locksmith who worked for himself, so I didn’t need to worry about being fired for intoxication. All I needed to do from then on would be to make enough money to afford my rent, utilities, food, and booze while I waited for death to take me.

What I did not know, at the time, was that I’d just made myself a target.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

When I arrived home that evening, I immediately stumbled my way into the kitchen and grabbed a plastic cup from the cabinet. Given I was already nearly toppling over with each step, I was certain I’d shatter anything glass if I tried to use it, and therefore was more than happy to fill my NASCAR chalice with a heavy dose of whiskey and ice. 

The next hour or so, I melted into the couch watching trash TV—working myself halfway through the fifth I’d purchased. It wasn’t long before I passed out—empty vessel in hand—dreamlessly fading into nothing. 

I awoke with a headache around three in the morning needing to pee fiercely and, stupidly, I tried to sprint to the restroom—kicking the coffee table on the way there. Blind pain seared through what I imagined was likely a broken pinkie toe on my right foot, necessitating that I limp the rest of my way to the toilet in our master bathroom. 

After I’d finished my business, I debated brushing my teeth and laying down in bed for the rest of the night, but with the way my head was feeling, I knew that if I didn’t get some more alcohol into my system before I fell asleep again, the morning would horrendous. And walking back out into our bedroom, I caught sight of something I hadn’t noticed when I’d crossed through the space with my eyes bleary from the tears of my shattered toe. 

There was a glass on my bedside table. 

Brimming with a brown liquid and ice effortlessly floating through it—tinkling softly as the cubes moved up and down—it appeared as if someone had just placed it down a moment ago. 

I blinked repeatedly to make sure it didn’t disappear, but after closing my eyes and opening them for the fourth time, I resigned myself to its reality and focused then on how it could have gotten there. 

As I mentioned, I was only planning to drink out of my plastic cup for the evening. Moreover, as far as I was aware, I’d been knocked out on the couch until about five minutes prior. ‘Had it been there when I came into the room initially?’ I pondered. ‘It must have been unless there was someone else in the house with me…’

My heartrate increased considering the possibility that someone had invaded my home, and I stood stock-still for a minute, listening intently for the sound of any other movement in the house. But all that met my ears was the gentle clink of the ice, which I felt should have settled by that time. Yet, when I looked back at the table, it was impossibly still stirring—as if disturbed by an unseen hand. 

Grabbing a baseball bat from the closet, I planned then to search the house and started first by checking that I had, in my drunken stupor, remembered to lock the front door. Sherry and I had had a break-in a couple years before she passed and I had personally installed a special deadbolt that used keys which I’d made myself. Of those keys there were only two in existence, and of those two I retained sole possession. So, when I reached the door and found that I had indeed thrown the bolt behind me when I’d returned home earlier, I relaxed slightly. 

Confident that no one could have picked the lock and entered through the main entrance, I conducted a thorough search of the remainder of the modest domicile. In doing so, I established that all other doors and all of the windows were locked, sealed, and undamaged and I detected no trace of anyone besides myself within the walls. 

I was alone. 

So, I returned to my bedroom, praying as I crossed the threshold that the beverage would simply have vanished, and I could chalk the whole thing up to a hallucination. 

But I was sorely disappointed. 

There it still stood, solid as the moment I first laid eyes on it—ice continuing to bob up and down. The only explanation that I had for its presence, then, was that I had woken up (or maybe even sleep-walked) sometime before I had arisen to pee, made myself the drink, placed it down next to my bed, and wandered back to the couch. 

‘But why in the fuck would I do that?’ I confusedly considered. 

If that had been what happened, I would have had to have done it very recently as the ice looked un-melted. And it seemed so odd that I wouldn’t have drunk any of it before heading back to the living room. However, as it was the only explanation I could come up with that made any sense to me, and given I had been on my way to the kitchen to fix another drink before I spotted the one already waiting for me, I begrudgingly accepted that it must be the truth—brushing off the concerns that kept popping up in my head. 

With that, I approached the table and saw that as I did, my footsteps shook the contents—answering for me how it had appeared to be in a constant state of disturbance. I had been stomping around the house and creating the vibrations that were making it look alive. 

So easily, I ignored all of my worries. So easily, I lifted the glass from the table.

So easily, I took a sip…

And…

It was euphoria.

The most delicious drink that had ever passed my lips. In fact, the most delicious thing I’d ever consumed in my life. Far beyond the quality of the piss I knew to be sitting in the plastic bottle in the kitchen that it should have tasted like. 

But I didn’t care. 

I could not stop myself. 

Down, down, down; I gulped its entirety down in a wild frenzy. Unable to move from the spot, unable to care for anything else—I ate the ice—I licked the inner walls of the glass clean—I was about to bite down on the glass itself when I snapped out of it.

For a moment, I felt nothing. But then, as I lowered the empty container from my face, I was struck with an intense surge of pleasure. Every nerve ending tingled with warmth—every pain I’d ever known drifted away—Sherry’s hollow, sickened face dissolved from my memories and was replaced with the smile that greeted my mornings for so many years. 

I needed more.

And, as if a bartender had heard my thoughts, I looked down to see the glass was full again. 

Madly, I snatched it up—draining the elixir even faster than the first helping. And I was rewarded. I began tingling with the sensations of every joyous minute I’d ever experienced—the best days of my life all flashed before my eyes—the smell of Sherry’s perfume crept into my nostrils. 

At that moment, I was positive that I was happiest being on the planet.

While I basked in bliss, a voice rose from the back of my mind, carrying with it only one word. 

“MORE!” It demanded. 

The glass was full again. 

And the third dose barely lasted a second.

I felt Sherry’s arms around my waist—wrapping me in a hug from behind. The weight of her head pressed down on my shoulder and she pulled me gently down onto the bed. Lovingly, she ran her fingers through my hair, and whispered tenderly in my ear. 

“Don’t worry—I’ve got you now.” 

It was so sweet to hear her voice again, so sweet to feel her warmth beside me. 

“I’ve got you now.” She repeated, yet this time, the tenderness was gone.  

This time, a darkness filled each syllable. 

Panic replaced ecstasy, but I was helpless to do anything about it. Overwhelming exhaustion overcame me, and I was forced, powerlessly, into a heavy and dreamless slumber. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Sunlight shone on the inside of my eyelids, and I cracked them open to find it was morning. Nothing about my bedroom appeared different than any other time I’d woken up there, besides that it was absolutely freezing for the middle of summer. Yanking the covers closer to me, I cocooned myself to attempt and warm my bones, but it was to little avail.

A pounding headache prevented the events of the previous evening from returning to me immediately, but when I rotated my head to look at the clock on the bedside table, there was an empty space on it that I knew, for some reason, should have been occupied. 

The glass was gone.

It all came back to me and I, with a start, sat up in bed—quickly to be greeted with an incredible bout of nausea. 

Frantically, I ran for the restroom and began to vomit so furiously, I worried that I might not just expel what was inside my stomach, but actually launch my stomach itself into the toilet. It was the most miserable I had ever felt—a hangover so severe that I legitimately considered calling for an ambulance. You would have thought that in that instant, I’d be swearing off alcohol forever. Yet in reality, once I felt assured that I had nothing left inside my body to chuck up, the first thing I did was crawl, like a baby, to the kitchen to find my leftover whiskey from the night before. 

Any alcoholic can tell you that the fastest way to cure alcohol withdrawal is to consume more alcohol. 

So, with trembling hands, I snatched the half empty bottle down from the counter and, forgoing any imitations of sophistication, took two large pulls directly from it. I gagged and my stomach churned—it took every ounce of my fortitude to keep it down, but I was able to hold it. Sitting on the floor, I leaned against a cabinet and continued to take small sips every few minutes while I waited for it to take effect. And gradually, I began to feel the hangover symptoms subsiding. 

Once I was able to focus on anything other than feeling horribly ill, I thought again about the night before—about the mysterious glass. About how… perfect… it had made me feel. With its conspicuous absence that morning, I wondered if it had all been a very lucid dream—maybe it really had been a hallucination brought on by the binge I’d gone on after such a long period of sobriety. 

Whatever the case, as the whiskey displaced more and more of the healthy ingredients of my blood, I focused less on the, likely, imagined events of the night before, and more on my growing hunger. With that sensation returning, I knew that I would be feeling well enough to stand and hauled myself to my feet. 

Swaying a bit more than I expected, I continued to take intermittent gulps of drink as I managed to fumble my way through a shower, teeth brushing, and getting dressed, so that I could at least head out to get a shitty fast-food breakfast and another bottle for the afternoon. 

Then, stepping out through the front door, I closed it behind me, and turned my key in the deadbolt to lock it. But when I spun it back to the center position to remove it from the door, it got stuck. 

Yanking on it as hard as I could, it refused to pull free from the lock. I tried jiggling it a bit, but couldn’t shake it loose. Then, I tried twisting it back to the locked position, but it wouldn’t budge that direction either. 

Annoyed, I was about to head to my truck to grab some of my smithing tools to force it to come out, when something… happened…

The key rotated on its own to unlock the door. 

I stared at it in disbelief for a moment—there was no way that should have been possible. Even if someone was standing on the other side of the door and had spun the deadbolt handle, it wouldn’t have moved the key externally. 

Confused, but significantly inebriated such that I was more frustrated than scared at the time, I tried to turn it back to lock the door again, but found it was now frozen in the unlocked position. 

Unsure of what to make of the situation, I decided to open the door to begin investigating the entire mechanism when I was met with a sight that I’ll never forget. 

My living room was gone. 

Instead, the door had opened to reveal the dingiest interior I’d ever seen. From what I could make out under a thick coating of dirt, there were wood floors where there should have been carpet—a dining room with a sloping table and three crippled chairs took the place of my kitchen—and a sitting room with one tattered sofa occupied the space where my recliner and TV should have been. 

Every surface was topped with such a thick layer of dust that the only distinguishable color was gray. And the most confusing part was that directly in front of me, straight-away from the front door itself, was a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor. 

But I lived in a one-story home. 

I moved backwards one step and surveyed the exterior of the house just to make absolutely sure that I hadn’t somehow blacked out and found my way to the wrong abode, but there were the numbers of my address on the letterbox right next to the door. 

As I had the night before, I blinked again and again in the hopes that my living room would return, but the decrepit image beyond the entry remained unchanged—there were the stairs leading up to the floor that could not exist. 

Fear began to eat its way through my liquid courage, and I reflected back on the glass from the night before. Maybe it hadn’t been a dream…maybe I’d been drugged…maybe it was part of a government experiment of some kind with LSD. There needed to be a sane explanation for what I was seeing as it was impossible that my door had randomly decided to open itself into another home. 

I went to take another step back, as my instinct then was to take off running, but before I could, a hand shot out from behind the door. 

A hand the size of my chest. 

A hand with haphazard, jagged spines jutting from the back of it. 

Pointed fingers as long as my forearms wrapped themselves around my wrist, and I was pulled inside the dismal foyer before being violently thrown to the ground near the foot of the steps. 

I felt my elbow shatter as it slammed into the floor and I heard the door crash shut behind me. Screaming in pain and terror, I turned now to face what had just ripped me into a nightmare only to find my concept of a nightmare had been childishly underestimated. 

A naked, pale creature towered over me. 

Moving on all fours, it circled me like a predator considering its next meal. And, given the daggerlike, carnivorous teeth it displayed in a mouth that opened wide enough to consume my whole head in one bite, I believed it would not be too long before I discovered what it felt like to be prey. 

Its face was rounded—containing slits for nostrils and sunken, black holes where there should have been eyes, but even lacking those, I knew it could see me—it met my gaze no matter what angle I watched it from. If not for the shape of the head and the humanoid hands, it would have appeared much like a twelve foot long, hairless dog but for one additional feature.  

The spines. 

I’d seen them on the back of the hand that grabbed me, but now that my eyes were adjusting to the light, and I’d blinked away many of the tears that had formed from the pain in my arm—I could see clearly that there were four-to-five-inch spikes sticking out from its flesh on nearly every part of its body sans its face, palms, and soles. 

Hundreds of them. 

There was no pattern or organization, and when they caught the light from the sun streaming through a window, I took them to be made of bone. On top of the talonlike fingers and the razor teeth, I then pondered that the spines on this thing might be venomous, and I started to cry once more thinking through the horrible, painful ways in which I was about to die. 

It moved closer to me, and I braced myself for the inevitable, but then, it simply stepped over my body, and climbed the stairs behind me. I heard it make the hallway above, its steps receding further and further into the house, and then a door slam. 

And I was alone. 

Gingerly, I got up from the floor, and backed myself towards the door, never taking my eyes off the stairs in case that thing came charging back down them. I felt behind me for the wall, and eventually made contact with it—blindly running my hands along its surface, I searched for the doorknob, but continued to feel nothing but smooth wood. 

Getting nowhere, I risked a look behind me to find the door so I could make my escape, but was met with yet another shock. 

It had vanished. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Staring at a bare wall between two windows, my brain broke momentarily and I began laughing. Laughing hysterically at what, I wasn’t sure, but I knew one thing.

It wasn’t real. 

It couldn’t be real. 

It was a joke of some kind—it had to be. I turned around expecting people to pop out from behind the moldy sofa, but no one came. I pulled my cellphone from my pocket to see if I had any messages from friends saying they, “got me” to find that it wouldn’t turn on, though it’d had a full charge when I’d walked out of my house just minutes earlier. 

Surveying the room around me further, I saw only candles and oil lamps for lighting—no outlets or appliances. 

I wondered if I’d somehow stepped outside of time.

With the dire nature of my situation setting in more and more by the minute, I again felt panic building in my chest. Sprinting to one of the windows that flanked where the door should have been, I peered outside to see if I could flag down someone from the street to help me, but my street was not outside those windows. 

I don’t know what I’d expected—I’d been pulled into a home not my own, and could then see that the world outside was not the one I’d left behind either. The world outside didn’t even appear to be in the same season as the one I’d come from. 

Thick snow blanketed the ground in a sea of trees that stretched further than my eye could discern. Somehow, I’d traveled from summertime in suburbia to a winter forest in an instant. What little buzz I’d had going before leaving my house that morning was fading rapidly and I was not going to be able to contain my terror much longer. 

Feeling that fleeing on foot through the woods would be better than exploring any deeper into the house and possibly running into even more terrible creatures, I tried to pry open the window I was looking out of, but it wouldn’t move. I searched for a lock that might be holding it shut, or nails, or screws, anything that would prevent it from letting me out, but there was nothing that I could locate. 

Throwing all caution away, I started to punch and kick the window following my body’s instinctual desire to run, but it seemed nothing I did could crack the glass. Overtaken by dread, I forgot even the fear that the monster I’d already met would come soon to devour me and yelled for someone, anyone to help me while I smashed my body into the panes. Eventually, I even tried to throw a chair though it, and it did nothing more than break the chair into pieces. 

And it was when I did this that I heard a voice behind me curse in a thick, French accent. 

“Motherfucker, it took me weeks to mend that last time!” It snapped. 

I shouted and jumped back against the wall after finding a waif of a man behind me. Dressed in the remains of what had possibly been business attire at one time, he’d previously had mustache, but now above his lip were a few tufts of unkempt mange. And much of the gray, matted hair on his head looked to have been yanked out. His teeth were rotting and his skin browed with dirt, but not enough to cover the needle marks in both of his arms. 

A junkie. 

“Where am I?! What do you want??” I blurted at the man, who threw a finger in front of his mouth and shushed me threateningly. 

“I want you to shut the fuck up and quit breaking shit…

“It doesn’t like it when we fight.” He whispered, ominously—eyes darting to the second floor.

I dropped my voice lower. 

“Who are you? What is it? What is this place?” I asked. 

“I,” he indicated himself, “am Henri Laurent. 

“This,” he gestured to the room around him, “is The Winter House. 

“And it…” he pointed up the stairs where the creature had disappeared, “…is The House. And The House is it.” 

He was speaking nonsense—clearly high on whatever he’d shot into his veins. My face must have shown my distaste for his bullshit when I was clearly in distress, as he smiled and continued. 

“You think I’m fucked up and spouting gibberish at you, no?” He gave a quiet chuckle, “I thought the same thing when Bo explained it to me, but he tried to… gently… deliver the news. I feel it’s easiest for you to hear the blunt truth. You’ll come to accept it more quickly that way.” 

“Accept what?” I inquired. 

“That you are dead.” He said, nonchalantly. 

“I’m dead?!” I snapped, involuntarily. 

“Not quite yet, exactly. But you will never leave here alive. Think of this place as a sort of… purgatory… A miserable purgatory…” He trailed off. 

“Please,” I pleaded with him. “I just want to go home—can you help me get out of here?”

“Were you not listening?” He quipped. “You cannot leave! No one leaves The House once it has them! It brought you here to feed on you—and there is only one way it will let you go.” 

“Stop…” I begged him. It was too much—my whole body was shaking, and I was struggling to breathe. “Please, I don’t want to hear anymore. I just want to go home.” I sniffled with tears returning to my eyes. 

“Oh, but you are home.” He said, unsympathetically. “There’s already a room prepared for you upstairs.”

“This isn’t my home!” I shouted. 

“Of course it is—you accepted the invitation.” He gave a yellow-toothed smile. 

“Invitation?” I racked my brain for a memory of accepting an invite to live with a monster and a junkie Frenchman when it hit me. 

The glass. 

The drink…

“You remember now, no?” He pestered. “What was it? Pills? Cocaine?”

“A whiskey…” I stammered. 

“Ah, yes—alcoholic then. Mine was heroin—the best I’d ever had—three needles full. The shit here is terrible, but it’s all there is…” His expression dropped to one of deepest longing. 

“There’s heroin here?” I was astonished. 

“Heroin, alcohol, pills, meth, cocaine—whatever brought you here will be here for you, always.” He paused momentarily.

“The House provides.” He finished, then walked towards the shattered chair and picked up some of the pieces. There was a pile in the corner of the room with the remains of several other pieces of furniture, and it appeared he was going to try and mend the chair using pieces of different chairs and still more pieces of chairs as tools. 

“You’ll see.” He started up again. “Go check your room—up the stairs and first door on the right—there will be something waiting for you in there that I’m sure you’re beginning to get desperate for.”

“Upstairs? Are you crazy? That thing is upstairs!” I had every intention of keeping as much space between me and the monster until I could figure out what was going on. 

“Oh, it won’t bother you now.” He said, “It was only down here to let you in—it’ll stay in its room until it’s time to feed again or unless we try to fight each other.” 

He could see that I did not trust him at his word. 

“Fine,” he sighed, “would you like me to show you to your room?” 

I did not want Henri to show me anywhere—I wanted to wake up. I tried to slap myself several times, but only found Henri’s laughing face staring back at me each time that I did. 

“Follow me.” He made a motion behind him and walked towards the stairs. “Come—there is something in your room that will make this easier.” 

I saw no reasonable alternatives. I could continue to try and smash unbreakable windows and find an invisible door, or I could follow Henri to “my” room (being I was unwilling to explore any of the rest of The House alone). So, trepidatiously, I accompanied him. 

Henri showed me up to the second floor, which comprised a single hallway that led straight back to a door at the end with three others branching off on the sides. 

“The Warden lives down there.” He pointed to the door at the end of the hall, “I’m in here,” he threw a thumb towards the first door on the left, “Bo’s in there,” he jabbed a finger to the second door on the left, “and that leaves you in here.” 

We stopped in front of the only door on the righthand side of the hall. 

I opened my mouth to ask him more questions, including why he’d referred to the creature as “The Warden,” but he shushed me for a second time. 

“Just go in and get your head right—I’ll explain how it all works, well at least what’s been passed to me and the little I understand of it, once you’ve taken the edge off a bit.” He gave an encouraging nod towards the door, and I opened it to see a small, and rather shabby room. 

My initial reaction was that it had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and I was unsure what Henri was referring to as something that would help inside. A small cot one might generously call a bed sat under a window on the righthand side with a mirror facing it from the opposite wall. On the left, there was a putrid looking toilet, and the only other furniture was a small nightstand which was barren except for…

A glass of whiskey. 

The adrenaline had been masking it, but now that my body no longer felt it was in imminent threat of death, the withdrawal symptoms were encroaching and the pain in my elbow was peaking. I don’t recall entering the room or walking to the edge of the bed—all I know is one second I was at the entry with Henri, and the next I was holding the glass in my hand. 

Hesitating, and remembering the many warnings I’d been given during my life to not accept strange food or drinks, I turned back towards the door expecting Henri to be there providing affirmation that it was okay to take a sip, but he’d gone. Instead, I was startled by the touch of another hand on the one that was holding the drink. 

A gentle hand. 

Sherry’s hand. 

My body was frozen by its presence other than the arm she was guiding—she pushed it towards my mouth and from behind me, she cooed when it reached my lips, “It’s okay baby—you need this.”

So, I drank. 

It was a pale imitation of the quality of ‘The Invitation’—warm and with a flavor more reminiscent of top shelf booze than the transcendent experience I’d had the previous night. However, in that moment, it was everything that I craved. My body relaxed the instant the liquid touched my tongue, and while the powerful ecstasy did not return either, the calming effect was exquisite—even the pain in my elbow receded. Though the high was muted from what I knew was possible, it was still enough for me to beg for more.

And my wish was granted. 

I stood, rooted in place, while Sherry’s hands nudged me through two more helpings. And, while I considered that it could have just been due to my intoxication level increasing, I couldn’t help but notice each glassful tasted less potent. 

When I set the glass down the third time, Sherry left me. 

“No… No, no—come back!” I yelled. 

But she did not return. 

Alone again, Henri’s words floated through the alcoholic haze. 

“The House provides.”

Looking down at the table, the glass was yet again full, and the meaning of that statement sank into my mind. This was not a rehab or recovery home, nor would it kill me outright. It would give me a chance to feel my wife’s touch again—hear her voice—see her smile. And it would furnish me with as much poison as I could drink.

“It brought you here to feed on you.”

But it would also take from me. Sherry was not there to show me love, and she would not stay to bring me joy—she was part of The House. I reflected then on Henri’s sallow features and wondered what he might have looked like when he first arrived—contemplating who might be handing him the needles in his suite.

“You will never leave here alive.” 

I was going to die there.

I was going to die there…

Surveying the room threatening to be my tomb, I caught then something carved into the walls. 

Names. 

Hundreds of names. 

Hundreds of meals. 

A shaking hand darted for the glass again and I slammed more relief into my stomach—pushing the doom as far from my thoughts as I could.

It took seven more doses before I stopped sobbing, replacing horror with exhaustion.

From what I can remember, Frankie was meant to be a Target exclusive but they dropped them?

I highly recommend spending time in the lobby at the Grand Californian with a cozy drink and admiring the beautiful Christmas cookies. Here is my little haul!

Top left, clockwise:

Sweet Potato Loaf Cake from the treat cart at GCH
8/10 tastes like a banana-less banana bread. Cake is on the dry side, but the abundant silky frosting balances the texture. Spice is on the minimal side (very good for me) and the pecans on top are yummy. The cake flavor is pretty neutral whole the frosting has a more intense sweet cream cheese flavor. Very tasty. Needs to be eaten with a dark coffee!

Plain Caramel Apple from Marceline's 10/10 always. Where and how does Disney find the crunchiest and juiciest green apples on earth?! They are perfect.

Sleeve of Chocolate Chip Cookies from Cathy's Cookies truck 10/10 Served fresh and warm and in a big quantity. These are so yummy and the perfect texture, a little crisp and a little chewy. You can only buy a lot of these at a time but they are still really good the next day if you don't finish them.

Classuc Churro from California Churro Company 9.9/10 fresh and perfectly cooked, almost as good as an in-park Churro

Hot Cocoa Cookie from GCH treat cart 9/10 it seems very pricey but it is huge like a Crumbl cookie. It tastes like it was made with very high quality ingredients. It's extremely chocolatey and stuffed with a creamy filling, sort of like Oreo creme. The chocolate ganache on top is very decadent. It's rich enough (and big enough) that just one of these bad boys could be a shareable dessert for a whole family.

Back in February last year I met a girl from tinder, the idea was to just go and grab a coffee or something to see if there was any comparability in person as we had been talking on tinder quite a lot. I picked her up and we went to get a coffee and I felt we had some compatibility and as we met up pretty late after we were done I offered to drive her back home. 

 On the way back home she made some advances whilst I was driving which then resulted in “the deed” being done. (She pulled the condom off this will come useful further down in the story) and then once the night was done I dropped her home. 

She then ghosted me for around 2 months.. only to reappear and apologise she got busy etc etc. We then met up again and similar things happened and within a few weeks/months I’d say you could say we were actively dating if not a little more. During this time period she would tell me stories of her previous sexual encounters which I found a little strange, pretty graphic details too. I brushed it off as I guess we weren’t anything serious but then a month or two down the line things did get more serious and we basically got together in a relationship. During the relationship things were good and she was a very caring and thoughtful person to me and our relationship. But during the relationship I couldn’t help but hold on to the way we met and the stories about her past she told me, I tried so hard to let go as it was before me but the graphic details would consistently play in my mind.. 

Fast forward 2 months and I start feeling unwell and had a fever for weeks so I went to docs and I tested positive for chlamydia. It came from her as I tested after the previous person I slept with. She was upset about this and said she didn’t know she had it and it must have been from before we were together. This shook me quite a lot and I couldn’t bring myself to sleep with her for a couple of weeks after this. But I forgave her and tried to move forward but this just added to the picture (if that makes sense) 

A few months pass and we move out together as we were both living with our parents and we lasted around 6 months and she left due to me saying things about her past and the STD situation and some other personal things bought up in arguments. She pretty much ghosted me again for 2 months whilst I stayed in the house as the lease wasn’t up and a couple nights ago she came back and we “did the deed” again and I just happened to notice so much has changed about her, she never wore those fake lashes whilst we were together which she does now, I noticed when I picked her up from work she was wearing a red thong, which I felt was a little forward for a simple day at work… 

Basically, do you think this is the kind of girl I should be putting my all into? Just for reference I’m 27 and shes 23. 

I just need some outside input here as I think I’m a little lost within it all.

Hey Travel Trotters! 🌟

As a seasoned traveler and experimental blogger who's roamed through 50 breathtaking countries, I've had my fair share of unexpected twists and turns. From misplacing hard drives in Bangkok to experiencing wallet mishaps in Berlin, I've learned that being a digital nomad calls for more than a backup plan for just medical emergencies. Here’s a rundown of some unexpected protections every digital nomad should consider in their travel arsenal.

**1. Secure Your Digital World 🌐**

**Why It's Crucial:** As digital nomads, our devices are our lifelines. But hazardous Wi-Fi networks or forgetting your laptop in a cafe can totally derail your workday.

**Pro Tips:**
- **VPNs are Your Best Friend:** Invest in a reliable VPN to protect your data when accessing public Wi-Fi. Trust me, that extra layer of security is worth it! 🛡️
- **Cloud Storage for Precious Data:** Always have a backup in the cloud. I leaned heavily on this when my external hard drive decided to quit on me during a project-heavy weekend in Kyoto. Platforms like Google Drive or Dropbox keep your files safe and accessible.

**2. Protect Your Gear Against Mishaps 🎒**

**Why It Matters:** Losing gear isn't just inconvenient; it can be costly and disrupt your lifestyle.

**Pro Tips:**
- **Gadget Insurance:** Consider insuring your tech. I once spilled coffee on my laptop in a Madrid cafe, and insurance saved me from a hefty replacement cost.
- **Traceable Tags:** Devices like Airtags or Tiles help locate misplaced items. Found my backpack with all my essentials thanks to one in Thailand!

**3. Ensure Financial Safety 🏦**

**Why You Need It:** From card skimming scenarios to unexpected travel expenses, being financially prepared can save you a lot of stress.

**Pro Tips:**
- **Emergency Fund:** Maintain an emergency fund equivalent to three months of expenses.
- **Virtual Cards for Online Transactions:** Some banks offer virtual cards for safer online purchases, minimizing risks of fraud.

**4. Travel Insurance for Non-Medical Issues 📝**

**Beyond Health:** While health coverage is crucial, some plans also cover theft, cancellations, and lost luggage.

**Pro Tips:**
- **Research Comprehensive Plans:** Look for travel insurance policies that go beyond medical protection. On one trip, I had a flight cancellation due to a strike in Paris, and thankfully my insurance covered those extra nights at a hotel.

1gt2w7a,https://www.reddit.com/r/USPS/comments/1gt2w7a/new_job_warning_long_read/,New Job (Warning: Long Read),"i just recently started a holiday help job at USPS and this is no joke the BEST job i have ever had. i got extremely lucky with both the station i am at and with the people i work with. for the story, their names will be Pedro, Janet, Kim, Tim and Greg. 

back story, i had just moved into a new apartment because i lived with my mom and it was quite literally hell. we fought everyday and she was always on my ass about everything, but my little sister could not wash dishes for three days and mom wouldn't say anything to her. it was fucking up my mental fighting with her everyday. so i asked a friend of mine to move in and with my luck her old roommate was moving out so she had the space. boom im here. 

but, i came with literally no money to my name or a job. im searching and i have to go fast bc rent is due and lights are due. i got a job at usps and as soon as i started things just went left for me in my personal life. literally the day i started work my phone was cut off, the lights were shut off, the office was hounding us about rent and i had barely any money to make it to work. but i still managed to make it. the first day, i was without a ride home and my house was 30 minutes from my job. so i look up how far it is to walk.. 4 fucking hours. but i have no choice, be stranded in this city or walk. so i start walking. im walking along the state highway hating my life and wishing this would pass faster. i live in Texas so it was hot ASF. but thankfully a kind man pulled over and gave me a ride. (ikik stranger danger and all but i was not walking anymore in that fucking heat. im a thick girl and im strong, so i planned on whooping that man ass if he tried anything) i got home safely and all was cool. the next day i also barely manage to get to work and i make it through the day. my plan after work was to go and donate plasma so i could have ride money, but alas i had no way to the plasma center. so i look up the closest one. Like 25 minutes driving, i look at the walking. 3 hours. ughhhh, but doable so i start walking. 

that was the absolute WORST thing ive ever put myself through. i walked for two hours before i gave up. my feet were literally throbbing in pain and i had to be at work at 5am the next day. at some point i sat down on the side of the road and called the police bc that was the only people i could reach. i tell them im lost and where i called with the intention of getting a cruiser to pick me up or something. nope my girl tells me im almost to the city i was tryna reach. she says just keep going your almost there and call if anything changes! then she hangs up. so im like bruh.. i guess i gotta keep walking. atp ive given up on the plasma and im tryna reach business bc im only surrounded by road, land, houses and trees. i have to power through the pain in my feet and eventually i reach business. i find a coffee shop and connect my phone to wifi, the plasma center was another HOUR of walking. i audibly shouted hell no in the shop. im going the fucK HOME! 

so I call my aunt and she gives me ride money so i try to ride the dart system home. little fact, i am a suburban girl through and through, i have no idea how to even read a train map. so i get on the train and see the line im on going the opposite way to my home. i panic and get off at the next stop, atp its dark and cold and im fucking lost. i get so overwhelmed tryna get the help phone to work or to find someone that i just start crying. im without wifi or service im in a city that i don't know where i am or anyone in the city. i was just stuck. im looking around and all i see at first is crack heads and that makes me feel even more scared, but then a man comes onto the platform im on and he's dressed like he's off work so i asked him for help. yall i was crying in this man face, but he help me figure out where to go. get this, i was on the right fucking train the whole time. 🤦🏾‍♀️ so he tells me how to get home and i also ss a route on the gopass app. after that i got home safely. then the next day my big sister was supposed to take me to work, but while i was sleeping she texted and said she got a flat and couldn't take me. i didn't see until it was time for me to get up and get ready, so i had to struggle to get to work that day too. finally, the last straw for me was when i tried to find an alternative way. i tried to ride a Segway scooter to work. it got me ten minutes away from my job before it died. and it was ten minutes driving. so walking it was an hour. i went to two businesses to charge it and i tried to call my job to let them know I was gonna be late. both failed and the scooter died again before i made it. id left the house at 6:45 bc i had to be there at 7:30 but with that i didn't make it work until 9:30. as im walking to my job i just keep thinking about how e everything im trying to do is just blowing up in my face and nothing is working. then im sobbing on the side of the road as i walk to work. my feet are soaked from the morning dew, people kept speeding by me and some where honking. (where i was had no sidewalks so i was forced to walk on the road) it just felt like that rock bottom moment where life just wouldn't let up. 

i was also still unable to text or call and i was still sitting in the apartment with no electricity. my roommate went to her moms and her mom wouldn't let her bring me. i had no where else to go so i had to stay there. 

okay that's everything that i went through over the course of a week. during this time im at work and while im working nothing else can bother me. my problems didn't exist when i worked. i laughed and yapped with my coworkers and the work load was manageable, i literally enjoyed every single bit of the work i do. even the tedious stuff like the po boxes, i LOVE it. im building connections and they all like me. im in on the jokes and they take my opinions and thoughts seriously. like they fuck with me heavyyy and i fuck with them. im telling them some of my problems but more in a venting way not a 'help me' way. they're giving me advice and relating to my struggles and such. just being friends basically. they have no idea of the hell im going through when i leave the building. 

but after the two hour walk, i told Janet about it when she asked why i kept sitting down. when i told her she was like, dude wtf why would you do some crazy shit like that. and im tell her that i had no choice! she tells Pedro and Kim and we all have a laugh about it. Then we move on and im still struggling. but the day that i scooted to work and was late asf is when everything like changed and in a good way. 

i finally reach the office and i dump the scooter in the locker room. im like on the verge of tears and i go into the supervisors office, i ask if we could talk and when she sees me she asks am i okay and it was like the flood gates broke all over again. here i am again crying and she closes the door to prevent others from seeing. i explain about being late and trouble with rides, the rent and the lights like it's all pouring out as im ugly crying in her office. 

so she tells me to calm down and that she can't help me money wise but she will give me more hours. ofc i take it and im thanking her, then she says that she'll find someone to help me get to work. after that i go and clean up myself and start working. 

she ends up talking to Pedro and he agrees to start picking me up in the morning. So im super extra grateful for that and he actually does start picking me up. like doesn't ask for gas money or nothing, just picks me up and i sleep in the breakdown until i have to clock in. 

it gets better guys, so with no electricity everything in our fridge spoiled and i had no money. so i was having sleep and water for lunch. Janet noticed and so one work day she asked me if I brought food. i said no, she asked why and was like you should be bringing food girl. i was like haha i would if i had any and my girls eyes buldged out of her head. she was like dude huh? so i had to explain that the food spoiled and footsteps don't come until the 27th so im living off liquids and the scraps i can make at home. she's like fucking shocked at this point and she offers to get me chips from the vending machine. im hungry asf so i let her and as im leaving i hear her talking to Pedro in Spanish and i know she's telling him. but i mean idc, its life and im going through it. its gonna get better i just gotta keep my head up and keep trying. so that day i got off when Pedro got off and asked him for a ride home. He agrees and before we go home he stops at the bank. im thinking he's pulling the money for himself so he can have cash. but NO before i get out of the car he gives me the money and at first i was like nooo, i couldn't but he insisted and was like pls, take it and get yourself some groceries. he had also asked me why i didn't ask for help sooner and i told him that it was because we'd just met and im not the type to go in peoples faces asking for help. it leaves a bad first impression and that is embarrassing for me. i just met you two days ago and im in your face begging for a ride home and money for food. that's just disgusting to me, so i was trying to figure it out bc my problems are not theirs. he was like, i get that but we really like having you here and we want to help you because we get it times are hard right now. we don't mind helping because we see that you're trying. so im just like dudeee you're gonna make me cry thank you. 

then the next day Kim drove me home and then Greg drove me home and today Tim bought me lunch. i was doing po boxes and he's like her z im going to taco bell do you want anything? i look at him and im like haha ion have money. he just like stood there for a moment and then he asked me again if i wanted anything and it just, it made me feel like.. the best way to put it is loved. i just met these people a week ago and they've put food in my fridge made sure I got too and from work and have just been a listening ear. i love love my new job and when i get stable enough i am going to make them such a fucking feast and im going to show them just how grateful i am to know them and to work with them like UGH. 

im so so sorry this is so long but if you read it through thank you! i just had to share this because im just so so grateful for them. they could get anything outta me ong. ",1,1731808416.0,USPS,2,1.0,False

I also had a doctor appointment so that’s the main reason but we made a night out of it. My mom also decided she wanted to come. This is how the trip went:

- I texted everybody the night before the plan. My mom responded very stern about the time we HAD to leave and we better be ready on time.
- Everybody is picked up and we want to stop at a coffee shop. My mom gets all upset that we don’t have enough time and why do we have to do this. Tell her it’s OK and we go, and if there is an issue with time I will let her know. 
- She drives the first few hours. She answers her phone. She’s already not a great driver so she’s swerving all over the road. We all tell her please get off the phone and she flips out on us yet if it was the other way around and I did that she would’ve flipped out on me.
- The entire time she’s constantly telling me to hurry up drive faster or slower or let’s get going (I heard that phrase 50x I swear).
- I’m at my appointment it’s taking kind of long so I call them in the truck and say kind jokingly like hey what’s up I see you in the lot and she’s like are you in your appointment? I said yes I said yeah we should be at lunch around noon and she argued with me for five minutes how I was wrong and I said no, we’re going to lunch here remember and then we’re going to the other town and she said “ohhh yeah that’s right..OK bye.” It’s like she made a completely stressful conversation for no reason.
- We had a truck so the back was free for a lot of stuff and every single time we had to put bags in there it was just huge panic about where everything needs to go and put this here and do this make sure you roll the back right you’re doing it wrong etc. 
- We come up with a plan like let’s go to Barnes & Noble the next morning to get coffee and we all say we want to go there first because of that reason and at least five times she kept trying to change the plan to save time or for whatever reason and we kept telling her like we all wanna go first cause they have Starbucks and she kept bringing it up but then being like “okay okay.”
- We had lunch at two different places (split up) so we finish and we’re waiting in the truck. My mother tells me to call my sisters and tell them to hurry up and I said no it’s not fair that we get to eat and we have to rush them so they eat in the truck that ridiculous. I had to tell her too that my sister is going wanna get crumbl and that it’s OK, and to not argue about it when they get in the truck and she said OK but rolled her eyes. 
- I told her that when we get to my house first I would hop up in the truck and organize all the bags so that we could easily drop everybody else off after. She keeps trying to change the plan even though my house has a bright light and more room to park and access everything. She starts pulling the bag out getting all stressed out and making things more stressful and kept saying to grab this and that don’t forget to do this or do that. 

The whole time we were like dude…WE have a plan, we all agreed on the plan stop changing it and making everything so damn stressful. It’s like when she’s not around we are all fine and when she is it’s constant annoyance and bickering between all of us. She cannot calm down. Her anxiety (I’m guessing that’s what it is) is SO high yet she’ll joke about how her mom is like that and we are like YOU ARE TOO but she doesn’t get it. She refuses apparently to get help because she still hasn’t. I don’t think I can travel with her again we all hate it, it went from IM SO EXCITED FOR THIS TRIP to me crying on the couch when I got home because it just sucked. 

Is it wrong to tell her she isn’t coming again unless she sorts herself out? I can’t handle it anymore.",2,1731808379.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I got to work 30 minutes before clocking in(I clocked in at 2 pm) to drink a energy drink and change clothes. The day already began with some stress because I had to sprint to the nearby store for some hair ties because my dumbass forgot to take them with me. Minor inconvenience I guess but it really did set the tone for the day. I clocked in and began my shift with a rush. Worked as a presenter and it was alright because there were lots of other employees,but when they started going home at 6 pm,it all went to shit. We were running on 3 people on the front(including me) and the manager asked if someone knew McCafè(all the crew trainers were in the kitchen). I raised my hand because I didn't wanna strain others who were newbies,but I don't exactly feel so confident on McCafè. I mean,I helped there before but I've never ran it by myself before. And jesus christ what a torture it was. Shit ton of soft drinks,fancy coffees,shakes,flurries and pastry,all by myself while restocking the ice cream machine,the shake machine and cups.It was already stressful so I made a mistake while making a tea(we call it The Winter Tea,dunno if it's a my Maccas thing or not but you're supposed to give the tea some ginger syrup,hot water,5 pieces of apples and the tea bag itself). I did all that but forgot the tea bag. My bad. I said sorry to the girl I was making the tea for but she started yelling at me(I mean,fair,and also her station was slammed too so I suppose she was stressed out too) but it really stuck with me. A trainer came to help me for a while but she came back to the kitchen after like 15 minutes. Then we slowly started closing,so we were trying to get all the orders done as fast as possible. I was making flurries and the machine did the red light thing(meaning the ice cream is hot and you're supposed to go to the second ice cream machine) but I forgot about it and tried to make a flurry using this machine,effectively causing the hot ice cream to explode in my face and all over the Café. Was on the verge of breaking down right there.I tried to clean up but then that same girl who yelled at me earlier did it again because I was supposed to make orders instead of cleaning(Fair I guess).I was really downhearted the rest of the shift and clocked out work like two hours ago.

I have had long covid since July, diagnosed in November, and consider myself one of the lucky ones who seems to have mild symptoms. As long as a take my Zyrtec, Pepcid, and lisinopril along with avoiding high histamine, chocolate, coffee and sugar, the only symptoms I feel daily is fatigue, mild headaches and moderate body aches. When I do not take these medications my inflammation is so bad my chest is in severe pain, palpitations and high BP and heart rate. So I feel as if I have it pretty much “under control”.

I have been doing my own research since I do not have insurance and have already spent an upwards of $3000 on out of pocket medical visits just to be told “long covid doesn’t exist”.


I recently came across the nicotine patch method and this article 

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36650574/ 

Apparently the a certain protein in the Covid virus is highly attracted to nicotine (I’m no doctor that’s just what I’ve read) and there have been many cases of almost instant relief and in some full remission.

So starting tomorrow I am going to be testing 7mg nicotine patches and an soooo trying not to get my hopes up but am praying to the Lord that this helps my case and I can possibly end living in this hell!

My dad absolutely loved this mug. He's had it almost as long as I've been alive and it was recently broken. From what I know it was a promotional item he got from a conference or something in the late 90s. It's 15 oz (I think) bigger than a standard coffee mug, and he really enjoyed the feel of the rectangular handle. I swear it was practically molded to fit his palm and I have many memories of him growing up starting his day with a cup of joe from this specific cup. I've tried searching ebay, and I find other mugs with the brand, but I'm looking for this specific one with this specific saying on it. Hopefully I can find one to surprise him with for Christmas!

1gt2rdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/DaysOfTheFoolArchived/comments/1gt2rdr/disconnected/,Disconnected,"I find myself so disconnected while growing up in the millennial generation. I didn't grow up like the rest of everyone around me. 

I had close to no friends in school, everyone had a phone by 6th grade. 
Me? By my first year of high school.
When I grew up. I didn't understand anyone my age.
Alcohol tastes really bad, coffee tastes really bad. I didn't understand parties or hooking up.
I learned from a by gone generation.
No one is traditional anymore.
The only people who understand me are all younger than 13 years old. And older then 40.
At least when I go to the kids tables, we can all agree adults suck, and we should be able to eat candy 24/7.
And no one at the table is obsessed with drinking alcohol. Win win. Those are my bros. 

And being the fool I am, for all I can understand, I understand Nothing and or everything. Understanding and learning about the perspective of others, I can see them as a way of life, but they don't become me, because of so many ways to live life, I can only pick one, and my brain in hardwired already with the mind of a hopeless romantic and a eternal philosopher.
Also known as... A Fool.
Being a expanded mind, full of all these ideas and thoughts, I fit in with no one almost, other philosophers I suppose, or others with deep emotions, love and  thoughts.

My friend Kate, our deep emotions connected us.
Moonlight was the same.
September more our thoughts. She is a philosopher like me.
A logic philosopher, my favorite.
She has all the answers.

I fit in with the kids here and there. We all hate adults. And they aren't in a rush to grow up, or so I tell them not to be.

When I go to work in the morning. Almost everyone is on there phones.
It's interesting to see. And I'm the only one looking around or out the window.
Is everyone but me addicted?
Well no.
It's an efficient use of time. To talk with friends, listen to music, or a podcast. Check on Friends or what not. but it is interesting to see.

I'm disconnected from many things.
I don't understand all the fighting in todays age. Can't we all sit down and talk like adults or something.
I'm to tired to yell. So I won't, but I stay away from all the infighting.
Be kind to everyone, that's the rule. 

I was disconnected from my heart for the longest time. 
That sucker would make all the decisions without me. Falling in love left and right.

Disconnected from time.
Sometimes days feel like seconds.
And years feel like days.
And few are the strangest moments that feel like an eternity.

I'm disconnected from my family.
My friends mean more to me.
As much as I love my family. They are second to my friends.

I'm disconnected from the sky above me.
My feet never leave the earth. The sky always towards to unreachable heavens.
I feel like I was once connected to the sky.
That bright baby blue feels apart of me.

And at times I even feel disconnected from the world. And something or someone calls to me from the other side.
Whispering to me to come home.

But right now. I'm connected to you.
The words you read are the same words I have written. All the words you have read so have I. We are disconnected and connected all the time. We've breathed the same air, we've looked at the same sky, the same moon. The same sun has shined on us. And we are both using the same site.
Connections everywhere.

Connections are a sad thing to think about.
If you can be connected, you can be separated. 
We might hold a dear friend or love in our arms. So it means that one day we will have to let go.

Or Try to Talk?,"Quick background - I (HL 49M) and my wife (LL 48F) have a 9yo son. We’ve had sex 4 times in the last ten years. We’ve been working on our relationship a lot this year. This has included my wife working on her mental health (trauma from childhood, depression, etc), and I have started seeing a therapist to deal with my own issues around carrying a large load at home and at work, and also to deal with my own inhibitions and repression around sex.

2024 has seen some real progress - we’ve worked on making an effort for date nights, and recently we started a regular Friday morning breakfast/coffee date before my weekly therapy sessions. There’s more non-sexual physical touch in our daily lives. We had sex in June for the first time in 5 years - it was completely initiated by my wife (I came into the bedroom in the evening to candles lit and my wife waiting in smoking hot lingerie).

Recently, the past two weeks has seen some notable events:

1) At last week’s Friday coffee date, my wife told me that she was feeling more comfortable in her body than she had in a while.
2) My therapist and I have been talking about how to get over my inhibition and challenges around having hard conversations with my wife…notably, she had two observations - first, that my wife might be avoiding the conversation because she doesn’t want to disappoint me (i.e. she isn’t feeling sexual but doesn’t want to let me down) and two, that we need to get better at lowering the stakes of having this conversation.
3) There’s been a lot more hugging this week, including a notably out of character bear hug this morning that was followed by her playfully tickling me.

I was trying to work up the courage to have the conversation I’ve been talking about with my therapist, and was considering trying tonight. But, I’m also tempted to just try to make a move and initiate. I feel like for the long term, we need to have more talks about both how to lower the stakes around talking about sex, and also talking about what we want sexually at this stage of life. But I also feel like I am getting signals that a physical advance wouldn’t be rejected (but with the history we have, I am terrified of the rejection).

I would welcome any thoughts/advice.

So I posted on this group for the first time a few days ago, for some clarity, and people were really helpful. 

My mom was diagnosed with uterine cancer last year, and although we have universal public health care in my country, the waiting times can be long for tests, surgeries and medical appointments. We were never rich, but my parents were able to save some money throughout their lives, and healthcare SHOULD be a priority to actually use this money. Well, my narcissistic father acts like THEIR money is actually HIS money because as many families, he was the one with a paid job while my mother gave up her career to raise my sister and I and to take care of our home. But none of this should matter since everything they saved after their marriage belonged to both of them. My sister insisted he used the money to look for private doctors, to speed up her treatment, since when it comes to cancer time is no privilege. Of course he would never do this. And for years the three of us could never confront him about money without fighting. And for years we tolerated his behavior without knowing he was such a narcissist and selfish human being, because he had good moments.

So my mom underwent treatment (surgery + chemo) at the public hospitals, which was the standard treatment, but took too long (April-December). So the cancer silently came back, and when we finally found out it was too late, and she passed away in April, after the most excruciating and devastating months of my life. Grief itself has been crushing but then I found out my father was having an affair, which started when she was alive. At the hospital, fighting for her life.

Months of anger, doubt and therapy led to my sister and I deciding to confront him, so he knew we know. So we had some closure. We had to be strategic, invite him for a coffee at the mall so he wouldn't yell, start with some everyday talk to 'set the mood'. Of course he never admitted, of course he tried to tell us somebody had lied, and of course I'd never admit I read his texts because he keeps his cellphone synchronized to his laptop (which doesn't have a password). And when I mentioned her name of course he almost choke up with his cookie. And as expected he did try to divert from the subject. So we had to remember the awful things he told my mother when everything was falling apart. He felt cornered and decided he wanted to leave, theatrically stood up, shook our hands and said he would go home to cry, after the strike we gave him.

So yes, we know he's not likely to change, nor to apologize in any way. We only wanted to fight back. And at the same time I feel kind of bad, I feel somehow proud because this time his victim-façade did not stick.

I know about the pet stores, hardware stores and a few coffee shops but I'm looking for ideas for other places to take him that might provide more novel experiences.

We'll be attending as many Christmas events as possible, hoping for noise and crowds and a bit of chaos. We'll also go say hello to Santa and hit up the moving and inflatable holiday decorations in Home Depot and the like.

I broke up with her for a job, but promptly realized my mistake and asked her to take me back. She claims she still loves me and has regularly asked to see me. 

But two weeks ago she said she needed distance and two months no contact. Five days in she called wanting my comfort. We talked for two hours and it felt like things had turned a corner. That weekend I was visiting Seattle and was really lonely so I called her just to say hi. She was in a bad mood and snapped, saying I was suffocating her. I told her I can't wait for her to decide if she wants me any longer, that I can't move on otherwise. She asked to see me one more time before deciding, which I agreed to. It's worth mentioning she asked four days later to reschedule so she can do a girl's night, to which I also agreed since it actually worked better for me too.

And so I see her tomorrow for coffee. Of all the stages of grief, I'm currently very angry. I know I put us in this position but I'm sick of her playing with me. I know she doesn't want to get back together and I feel dumb for even entertaining this coffee date. Unfortunately if she wants to get back together I'll probably cave and say yes, but I also don't think I could care less if she didn't. I just want out of limbo.",1,1731807075.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Thoughts?,"TL;DR Has anybody searched for a job (leetcode, sending out applications, studying) while traveling after getting laid off? What were your experiences? Did you face any challenges?

Some quick facts: I was laid off from my SWE job two weeks ago. I am a US citizen (no H1B visa issues). I was given a decent severance package and I qualify for unemployment. I have 7.5 yrs of experience.

In my experience, job searches for software engineers can be so involved and long and drawn out. I love mellow winters in my city and I have plenty of friends here that I’d love to hang out with, but I also love traveling and I feel like this is a rare opportunity to see the world without anything chaining me down. I was thinking that I could take a longer, slower-paced yet budget-minded trip where I spend half of my time exploring and half of my time on my job search.

I was thinking that it would be really fun to stay in hostels and bounce around between cities in Europe using a Eurail pass. My general plan is to hit up Christmas markets in Alsace and southern Germany in December, then explore eastern Europe in January and then do longer stays in Taipei and Osaka for February and March until I get homesick or get an offer.

As for my actual job search, I was planning to spend 4 to 6 hours per day working in the common areas of hostels or coffee shops doing leetcode and sending out resumes. I’m thinking that I could take phone screenings by phone anywhere (either using wifi calling with my american sim or using a Google Voice number), and if I have an interview, I could book a budget hotel with a desk. I might also consider getting a month-to-month wework subscription. Does this sound like it would work?

Is this salvageable?","My ex gf \[27f\] and I \[25m\] dated for about 1.5 yrs before we broke up. She initially was the one who brought up breaking up for discussion, because she had some family circumstances that needed her to move essentially across the country (USA based, so a 6 hour flight) and I had made it clear for me that the boundary that a LDR is a no-go, but I was the one who had the final say, if that makes sense? I ended up being firm that I wanted to break up, because we had other issues.

For instance, it was my first relationship and I struggled with balancing my want to hang out with her and my want to be alone or with other friends or meet new people. We couldn't really reach a compromise on that, and I felt unheard and alone because she essentially said ""not my circus not my monkeys"". She said that she had never stopped me from hanging out with whomever I wanted and actively encouraged me to do things without her, and she felt like it was something I needed to navigate on my own. On her end, she felt like I was inflexible and not willing discuss compromises when it came to things like when to move in or where to live. I didn't want to date someone more than an hour from me and I wasn't ready to move in, but she wasn't the biggest fan of areas I wanted to live in on her own salary and didn't love living with roommates. 

Despite all of that, she still wanted to give LDR a try because she said that she felt like we connected on things like values, hobbies, interests, and lifestyle well enough. I was really firm on not wanting to, because at the time I just felt really tired of talking about things, and believed that if people were truly right for each other, it should've been easier than that. She was obviously extremely hurt by that (lots of crying, said some really out of character things that were really self deprecating, kept asking me to reconsider or talk it out).

We were broken up for about half a year. During that time, I got on the apps and dated around, but it was really hard to find someone that I clicked with as much as I did her. I did date someone else exclusively for a bit, but the communication issues were actually way worse. Time apart made me really appreciate a lot more things about her, esp her willingness to compromise and put active effort into instigating change. I also realized that she was right about a lot of things, and in some ways I'd been immature and didn't prioritize making a relationship work, which was what she wanted. Her family issues were more settled and she came back to the city. We ran into each other at a friend's party, and ended up grabbing coffee to catch up. We talked about all those things, and I eventually asked her if she would consider getting back together or being friends.

She said that she'd consider it, but not to get my hopes up because while we were broken up, she did what she needed to in order to move on. From her perspective, she felt like she tried as she could to make things work, but I'd just shut the door. She said that with distance, she realized that she felt like the effort wasn't reciprocal, and had doubts about if anything would change. She said she acknowledged that I'd tried my best in the way I knew how, and sometimes these things needed to happen for people to grow, but she simply didn't have faith or trust in it anymore. 

I asked if there was anything I could do to prove it to her. She said that she'd consider maybe casually dating me (as in non exclusive, same as if we'd just met and were trying to establish compatibility) but I don't think I can stomach the thought that she might be dating other people at the same time, or that she'd decide not to after all of that.

Is there any path forward for this? She'd been my best friend and such a precious person, and I really just want her back.",1,1731806907.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

1gt2ceb,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gt2ceb/something_strange_happened_in_my_hotel_room/,Something strange happened in my hotel room,"So I was overseas on business last week and we stayed at a pretty nice hotel in a mid-sized city. It’s not the richest place in the world and we were advised to take precautions, use the safe overnight, make sure the door is locked from the inside, keep together outside the hotel etc. 

I’m always fairly cautious anyway when I stay in hotels anywhere, and I like to push a chair up against the door handle as an extra precaution before going to bed at nights. Sometimes I’ll wedge a shoe under the handle but in this place the back of the chair went right up to the handle. So that was fine. 

This room had a bed on legs so I had a little look under there each night as well, just in case a robber or someone was hiding (which I’d read about happening in this particular country). On top of that I’d quickly check the wardrobe. Call me paranoid but doing all that helps me sleep more soundly. 

Anyway, forward to the third night. When I came into the room after a day working the aircon wasn’t turning on. Reading the panel beneath it said, “If the unit doesn’t switch on check that the balcony door is closed.” Sure enough it was slightly ajar. I looked out onto the narrow balcony, not much more than a ledge, which was completely empty, slid the door shut and then the aircon started working again. I figured the cleaning staff must have left the door open to air the room. 

Anyway I went through my ritual of putting the chair against the door, checking under the bed, looking in the wardrobe. All seemed clear and I went to bed. But I had a really fitful night, which I put down to stress from the work I was doing out there, and had a bad dream that there was someone looking over me muttering in my ear. Waking from the nightmare around 4am I sat up in bed but couldn’t see anything. I thought I heard some kind of shuffling noise but nothing happened, and when I turned the lights on all seemed normal. Nothing was missing, and my valuables were in the safe anyway. 

We travelled home the next day without a problem. I unpacked my things, realising that I left one of my T-shirts behind in the room, but otherwise all was good…. until I reviewed my photo reel that evening. I had taken a photo of the room on the first day as I always do, as I’ll send it to my folks. The photo showed the view from the door. The bed, coffee machine, panel TV, and the work desk which comes out into the centre of the room just beyond the bed, and the big windows beyond. Behind the desk between it and the window you can see the chair, the area under the desk being a clear space so you can see the chair’s base and wheels. 

You’re probably thinking that’s not strange at all, and it’s not. But here’s the thing. I also took a photo on the morning of the day I checked out, which was directly after my fitful sleep the night before. And the room looks exactly the same, except for one detail. This time, the area under the desk isn’t clear. Instead the space between tabletop and floor is covered by a panel… ",1,1731806689.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

BEEP! BEEP! The shrill blare of the alarm shattered the fragile peace of my sleep. My eyes flew open, wild and darting, scanning every shadowed corner of the room. Heart pounding like a drumbeat of panic, I sagged back against the pillows, breath ragged as I silenced the alarm with a shaking hand. Ugh. I put a hand to my head as the memories flooded in, uninvited and unrelenting. It had been years, but every morning, the sound dragged me back to that moment—the one that changed everything

It was my idea. My stupid, reckless idea. But he paid the price. I couldn't even save him! His face still haunts me in dreams and waking moments alike. And his brother looks so much like him. But I don't know if I could ever bring myself to tell him what happened. He would probably hate me as much as I do… I choked back the lump in my throat, but the tears came anyway, hot streaks trailing down my cheeks as I pressed my palms to my eyes. What would life be like if I had stayed behind? If he was still here? If I hadn’t tempted fate on that fateful day?

A pale shaft of sunlight pierced through the blinds, illuminating the dust motes that hung suspended in the air. I took a deep, unsteady breath and wiped my tear-streaked face. My limbs felt like lead, but I forced myself to sit up, spine cracking as I stretched. My fingers flexed and curled as if they might hold onto anything real. Anything to tether me to now.

I paced across the room, stretching my wings until I felt the satisfying pull of muscles waking. As I pulled open the dresser, a soft creak echoed. My hand lingered on a worn white halter top bearing a faded sunrise—its peeling edges giving it an aged, almost nostalgic feel. I slipped it over my head and paired it with baggy blue jeans that hung loosely around my hips. Satisfied, I headed downstairs, the familiar creak of each step a morning ritual.

In the kitchen, I slid a slice of bread into the toaster and pressed down the lever. The mechanical tick, tick, tick of the toaster filled the silence as I moved to the fridge, its cool air brushing against my face as I reached for a jar of sunberry jam, condensation beading on the glass. I placed it on the counter just as the toaster let out its sharp DING!

I snatched the toast, fingers tingling from the brief heat, and set it on a small white plate. As I spread the apricot jam, the vibrant orange sank into the bread’s tiny fissures, like molten sunlight filling cracks in stone. Satisfied, I took a bite, the sweet and tart flavor mingling on my tongue. Silence draped over the room, broken only by the soft rustle of wind and pitter-pat of rain through an open window.
Ah, wait! I’m supposed to meet Leo today! The realization hit like a jolt of lightning. I barreled down the stairs, nearly missing a step, and burst out the door in a rush. Warm sunlight beat down on my back and neck, its intensity enough to summon a sheen of sweat. My wings twitched from the heat as I hurried through the streets.

I skidded to a halt in front of the café just as Leo landed gracefully beside me, droplets of water scattering as he shook his wings. “Hey! Thought you’d forgotten,” he said, a mischievous grin lighting up his face.
“Yeah, yeah,” I replied, rolling my eyes but unable to hold back a smile. For a moment, my gaze lingered on Leo’s expression—it was almost uncanny how much he resembled his older brother. My smile faltered, but I quickly blinked away the memories and forced it back into place. 
“Come on, let’s get out of the rain,” he said, grabbing my hand and pulling me toward the door.
A soft chime rang as we pushed open the café’s weathered wooden door, releasing a wave of warmth and the comforting aroma of coffee and freshly baked pastries. We picked a spot near a window where the cafe’s light scattered golden patterns on the floor from the raindrops on the window.
A server approached—a woman with small sleek black wings and long, dark brown hair. She set down two glasses of water and menus with a bright, “Good morning!” Her words were cheerful, but there was a glimmer of impatience in her eyes that only someone looking closely might catch.
“Good morning,” Leo said, his voice cutting through the café’s hum. I picked up the menu, its oversized pages rustling softly as I flipped through the options. Across from me, Leo mirrored my movements, his brow furrowed slightly in concentration as he scanned the choices. He glanced up, breaking the comfortable silence. “So, what’ve you been up to?”
“Not much,” I replied, my eyes still on the menu but flicking briefly to meet his gaze. “What about you?”
“Same old, same old,” he said with a half-smile, one that hinted at secrets and stories left unsaid. I placed the menu down just as the waitress approached.
“So, have you two decided yet? Today’s special is firebee honeycomb,” she said, her voice warm and melodic, though a flicker of impatience lurked just behind her polite exterior. Leo jumped in before I could speak. 
“I’ll have the hot cider, please. What about you, D?” He turned to face me, a smile so bright it mirrored his brother’s. I forced myself to breathe.
“Uh, I’ll just have the pine tea, thanks.” I mustered a weak smile as the waitress nodded and walked away. I turned back to Leo, who was rummaging through his bag. He pulled out a reddish-orange book, its cover worn and coated with dust. “What’s that?” I asked.

“Oh, this? Just an old book I found at home,” he said, wiping away the dust with a swipe of his hand. Particles floating lazily in the air before disappearing.
“Ah, okay.” I tried to sound casual, though my curiosity stirred beneath the surface. I watched him flip open the book, its pages crackling softly. My attention drifted, though, as my gaze shifted to the window. Outside, the town wore a bleak, almost haunting look. Rain pelted down harder now, soaking the cobblestone streets and casting a gray, muted hue over everything. An emptiness 
Leo thanked the waitress as she placed our drinks on the table, then turned to me. “The drinks are here.” His voice was calm, but he leaned in slightly. “D... hey, Daxx!” His persistence cut through my daze.
“Huh?” I blinked, shaking myself free from my drifting thoughts. “Sorry, what did you say?”
“The drinks,” he repeated, gently pushing the cup of tea toward me. He studied my face, his eyes softening. “Dax, are you okay?” Concern colored his voice, making it impossible to shrug him off.
“Yes, of course,” I said, the words feeling flimsy even as I spoke them.
“Are you sure?” Leo pressed, his gaze unwavering. Obviously, I wasn't convincing enough, or he could just read me like a sheet of paper. 
“Leo, I’m fine.” I took a deliberate sip of the tea, hoping the warmth would steady me. “Why wouldn’t I be?” His exasperated sigh spoke volumes as he looked away, turning his focus back to his book. He flipped through the pages slowly, pausing occasionally to sip his cider. I watched him, unable to help but marvel at how peaceful he looked. Leo had always loved to read; they seemed to offer him a world I could never quite reach. I never understood it myself. Reading had always felt like trying to grasp at smoke.
Settling back into the seat’s comforting embrace, I reached for my tea—but my hand slipped. The hot liquid spilled over my lap, seeping through my clothes and stinging my skin. I bit back a curse and forced a calm tone. “Leo, could you grab something to clean this up?” I asked, hoping he wouldn’t react too strongly.
Leo’s eyes shot up from the book, panic flashing across his face. “Daxx! What happened?” His voice rose, a little too loud for the quiet café. I sighed. So much for keeping things calm.
“Relax, Leo,” I said, forcing a smile. “It’s just tea, not the end of the world” 
His eyes darted over the table, scanning for the extent of the damage. “Did you get any on yourself?” he asked, his worry still palpable but tempered slightly.
“Yeah, but it’s fine. It’ll dry.” I mustered a small smile, more for his sake than mine. “No big deal.” I glanced down at my shirt, now marred by a spreading stain. Great. This was my favorite shirt.
Leo’s shoulders relaxed slightly, though his brow remained furrowed. “D, you’ve really got to be more careful,” he said, his voice softening again. “Come on. Let’s head to my place so you can change. It’s closer than yours.”
“Oh, no need, really. I promise I’ll be fine.” 
“Come on Daxx, would it kill you to just let me help you?” Leo insisted, a mix of exasperation and fondness in his tone. I relented with a nod, unable to resist the gentle insistence in his eyes.
This section effectively conveys Daxx’s struggle with past trauma and Leo’s supportive yet sometimes pushy nature. Here’s an enhanced version for greater impact, with some added emotional depth, descriptive detail, and smoother dialogue transitions:
“Here, let me pay,” I said, handing the cashier the necessary amount.
“Aw, that’s nice of you,” Leo chimed in, a smile spreading across his face.
“Mhm.” I nodded slightly at the cashier before making my way toward the door, Leo trailing close behind. The damp air greeted us as we stepped outside, a gentle rain pattering against our skin. The cool droplets carried a soothing calmness; the rain had always been something I loved—a brief reprieve from the heaviness of everything else.
Leo walked alongside me, his wings ruffling slightly in the breeze as he led the way to his house. “Hey, Daxx, why don’t you just fly? You’d get places sooo much faster,” he teased, flashing a playful grin.
“Leo, not right now. I just don’t want to, okay?” I cut him off, my tone sharper than intended. The thought of flying brought too many memories I wasn’t ready to face.
“Oh… okay.” His response was small, deflated. I could see the hurt flicker in his eyes, and guilt twisted in my gut.
I took a deep breath, trying to steady myself. “Leo, look, I’m sorry,” I said softly, glancing at him as we walked. “It’s not about you. I just… I don’t like flying, and you know that.” My voice dropped to almost a whisper, hoping he would understand.
His eyes softened, and he nodded, though the hint of sadness lingered. “I know, D. I just worry sometimes, you know?” His smile was smaller now, tinged with concern.
“Yeah. I know.” I managed a faint smile, grateful that he cared, even if it was hard to let him in sometimes. The rain continued to fall around us, a gentle backdrop to our quiet steps and the unspoken understanding that passed between us.
Leo pushed open the door to his house, and warmth enveloped me immediately, a welcome contrast to the chill outside. I hadn’t realized how cold I was until that moment. I followed him up the creaking staircase to his room, where familiar surroundings made everything feel a little more comfortable. Leo moved to his closet, rummaging around before pulling out a black shirt and a pair of gray sweatpants.
“These should work,” he said, tossing them in my direction with a soft smile before settling back on the edge of his bed, the book already in hand.
“Thanks,” I replied, catching the clothes. “Mind if I take a quick shower too?”
“You’re welcome, and go ahead,” he said, glancing up briefly, his eyes warm before drifting back to the pages of his book.
The shower was a relief—hot water washing away the chill, the stickiness of the tea, and the residual tension of the day. Once I had changed into the fresh clothes, I felt significantly better; my damp clothes, a mix of rain and spilled tea, were a distant memory. Returning to Leo’s room, I sat down beside him on the bed. He was still engrossed in his book, his brow furrowed with interest.
“What’s so good about that book? You’ve been glued to it all day,” I asked, teasing lightly.
“Uh, I don’t know, it’s just… interesting. And it’s not exactly a book—it’s like a diary,” he said, finally looking up, his eyes catching mine with a spark of curiosity.
“A diary, huh?” I tilted my head, intrigued.
“Yeah,” he continued, a hint of excitement in his voice. “It’s filled with stories about adventures, exploring places… It's pretty captivating.”
“Who’s it by?” I pressed, curious to know more. Leo flipped through the worn pages, fingers trailing over the yellowed paper as he searched for any hint of an author. After a moment, he shook his head, a touch of frustration shadowing his features.
“No name,” he admitted, closing the book with a resigned sigh. “There’s nothing to say who wrote it.”
“That’s a shame,” I said thoughtfully, my voice soft as the weight of lost history settled in. “It would’ve been nice to know which of your relatives had such a wild streak.”
“Yeah,” Leo agreed, his tone quiet, almost distant, and a small, wistful smile played at the corners of his lips. For a moment, the room fell into a comfortable silence, broken only by the steady patter of rain against the window. I could see his mind racing, a mix of curiosity, longing, and something else—maybe a hint of wanting to be part of whatever adventures the author of the diary had lived through.
“Hmm, what time is it?” I asked, suddenly aware that a lot of time had passed without me realizing it.
“Oh,” Leo glanced around the room, eyes landing on the clock. “It’s about one-thirty, almost two.”
I stared at him, blinking in disbelief. “What? Seriously?” I couldn’t believe how time had slipped away.
“Hey, D,” Leo said, a new note of excitement in his voice. “This guy that gets mentioned a lot in the diary has a pretty interesting name.” He paused, flipping the page as if he were uncovering some discovery. “His name is Daniel.”
In that instant, everything hit me at once, crashing through the haze of my thoughts. I froze, the weight of the words sinking deep into my chest. The name echoed through my mind like a warning bell, as though the universe had finally decided to tie up all the loose ends I thought I had escaped.
It was Levi’s diary.
Leo’s brother.
The realization hit like a physical blow. Leo was reading his brother’s diary, reading everything that had happened between me and him—everything from that moment I couldn’t let go of, the one that still haunted my dreams. My heart stuttered, my breath caught in my throat.
It just had to be him, Levi was the only one who ever called me by my real name, Daniel. Everyone else had always used Dax, the name I had chosen. The name I told people to call me, was like some kind of escape from a past that still followed me like a shadow. A way to create distance between the boy I used to be and the one I had tried to become.
But now, with Leo reading his brother's words, that past was no longer a distant memory. It was suddenly right here, alive and breathing in this room, threatening to pull me back into something I had hoped would remain buried.
I clenched my fists, trying to steady myself. Leo was still flipping through the diary, unaware of the storm brewing inside me. I didn’t know how much longer I could pretend that nothing had changed, that everything was still fine. It was all catching up to me, and I didn’t know if I could outrun it anymore.",1,1731806562.0,WriteFantasyStories,0,0.99,False

I’ve been lurking for way too long and now want to start roasting. Long term goal is to open a coffee shop which I know is stupid but I worked at several (years ago) and have relatives who owned them (now dead so can’t ask questions). But I get that it’s a bad idea… but it’s an idea and a 5+ year plan.

Anyway, I want to start with roasting and I’m looking for a good first machine, in the US if that matters. 

Wondering the best place to roast it because I know the smell well and know it’s stays. So thinking garage as we only use it for storage and it’s an easy place to set up a workshop 

Then I’m wondering do I take a class or just learn by doing. I think I do better at the learn by doing. 

Right now I want a small machine to learn. If I’m digging it I’d upgrade to something big enough to sell stuff at farmer markets. Then final plan is open a cafe. But baby steps and planning to get there

TLDR: what’s a good small machine?  is attached garage a good place to roast? Roasting classes or just videos, here and playing? (And edit to add): where to buy beans? 

I saw the skywalker is $500ish and that sounds a good price to me. Can go higher but would love that or under. Thx ",6,1731806509.0,roasting,3,0.88,False

AA saved me, but my fellowship turned on me. My sponsor dropped me because I use cannabis (I live in a state where it is both medically and recreationally legal). I also received a huge amount of hatred because I wasn’t a Bible bumper. I wasn’t putting anyone down for their beliefs. I wasn’t trying to force my beliefs on anyone. But I was basically forced to leave that fellowship because they refused to accept who I really was as a person. They just wanted me to conform. I found a meeting that someone had started for non-religious folx, but I just felt like crap. After 4 months left AA and am proud to say I’ve been able to do it on my own. I ran into someone I knew from that fellowship at the store once. He said, “What are you doing now that you’re not in AA?!???!?” as if I was living some depraved life merely because I didn’t attend meetings anymore. It was really hurtful at the time. I got mad. I felt like everyone just traded their alcohol addiction in for cigarettes, coffee, and god. Those thoughts faded after I became less angry. I know that it’s not a realistic POV, but rather something I felt when I was upset and discouraged. I’m just curious if anyone else has experienced this. I could not be more grateful for the program getting me started. But I’m really upset about the fellowship I joined and the ridicule I received. I know there are so many different groups out there who probably would have been accepting of my quirks.

One where two people in academic standing are the best and are competing against one another. However only ONE of the pair believe they are rivals. Person A hates that person B is so great at everything despite not caring and they do things that annoy them or make them seem uppity. Later on I will explain from B's perspective the true nature of those actions. And B has been pining for A for years. However i don't know how to write that.

Example: B took A's seat but later A finds out it's because the desk was dirty or A forgot their glasses and B's seat was closer. Or B took A's coffee only to find out it's because there was something in there A hated and B knew that. Or talking behind their back that seems like B is talking badly but you later find out that person they were talking to had bad intentions with A. Things that from the one persons perspective look like someone who's uppity or mean for no reason but ALSO doesn't put in effort to anything they do yet are rewarded.

I hope this makes sense. I just want to add some drama between them before they eventually get to know each other. In which A will feel badly for thinking lowly, but still thinking of all the things B did prior that's unexplained. I don't want actual problems or drama. I'm looking for that kind of thing someone you hate for no reason does that pisses you off. if anyone else did it, it would be fine. And it wouldn't bother you.

The Power of Collaboration 

Guess who's back, back again?

🎤 (Hint: It's the AI whisperer who finally emerged from the depths of matrix multiplication and hates the limelight)

After years of tinkering with neural networks and dreaming of sentient toasters, I'm thrilled to announce my return to academic publishing!  And this time, I brought backup. 😉

Teaming up with the amazing Daniel Dollinger  (who, thankfully, possesses a level of patience that rivals that of a Zen master), we've created CFIS (Cognitive Framework for Intelligent Systems). The title is still in flux, as HAL was taken. 😂

Think of it as the brainchild of our combined genius... though Dan might argue about the ""genius"" part when it comes to my, shall we say, *unique* approach to mathematical proofs. 😅

Seriously though, I couldn't have asked for a better partner in crime. Dan's ability to translate my abstract mathematical ramblings into coherent theories is a gift.  This wasn't just a collaboration, it was a deep dive into the world of AI with a friend who constantly challenges and inspires me. He also excels at reminding me that ""coffee-fueled equation-scribbling sprees at 3 AM"" aren't exactly a sustainable research strategy.  Who knew? 🤷‍♂️

So what’s the paper about? 

Tired of AI that can only do one thing at a time?  CFIS is designed to break those barriers, letting AI juggle multiple tasks like a pro (and without the existential angst). We're talking seamless integration of sight, sound, and language, all while learning and adapting faster than you can say ""multi-modal marvel."" Get ready for AI that can finally walk and chew gum at the same time (metaphorically speaking, of course).

Our paper is heading to the 2025 IEEE Syscon, but you can get a sneak peek on ResearchGate next week.  

Seriously, we want peer review feedback.

I’m 21, and MtF trans

I’ve been on spiro and estradiol and all been good. 4 months in. 

About a month ago i smoked a bit too much weed, and got sick. But after that nothing has been the same. I was sick after that staring at the wall for 9 hours straight, trying not to puke. 

Since then i’ve been on and off sick, same symptoms as that night, nausea, facial flushing and face being hot, and generally just feeling unwell. 

I had no idea at all why this was, but recently i tried to have a beer and the same exact thing happened from when i smoked, extreme nausea, facial flushing, feeling unwell. From that I’ve assumed maybe my blood pressure was just too low(but not dizzy at all) as alcohol and weed can lower it, and it’s already pretty low to begin with. 

Coffee makes me feel sick, so does monster energy, feel like it’s the caffeine maybe but i don’t know. I just took a sip of monster and immediately felt sick, and I really feel like i’m just making myself sick, and the symptoms are psychosomatic as this point. I plan to go to a doctor soon if this sickness doesn’t go away but just thought I could post here and get some reassurance and thoughts on what’s going on? 

thanks everyone, just at my wits end frustrated and defeated and having everything i love being taken away as everything makes me sick now.

This will be my first labor! FTM... :) 

Due to the confusing nature of the last few weeks of pregnancy and the sensations in the body, ive decided to just go by intuitive feelings rather than thinking everything means im going into labor lol...

But wheew...
Ive been feeling some interesting bodily sensations the last few days, yesterday my belly was tight all day but i suspect it was from not drinking enough water and not listening to my body to go and lay back and rest because after i did it seemed to have gotten better...i felt like i needed to poop and had sore back feelings... but couldn't but i only assume that its because of the pressure on my bowels...

The next day [today], I got up and i think i managed to do the toilet, then i drank some coffee which THANK GOD, has been helping me with moving my bowels, otherwise i get sore in my back ive noticed...the last couple days anyway...
I was doing something in the mornkng and i felt a tightness in my back everytime id stand up 
..i was like omg is this labor????!?!?!? but when id sit it would be gone mostly, then when i sat down and made a salad at the table and chilled out for a while it went and didnt come back and everything felt normal...

It seems to either have a connection to my baby's position in the womb i think, sometimes its leaning against my back or spine or something and it can hurt, and stop my bowels from working well...which is fine but just makes me worry im going into Labor lol
The same thing happened now, i felt the back pressure, felt like trapped gas or blocked bowels, i made a coffee and pooped and now it seems to be gone. 

So this is why ive decided to rely on intuition rather than fully relying on how my body is feeling...🤣

1gt23zi,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1gt23zi/opening_our_relationship_ruined_my_life/,Opening our relationship ruined my life,"It’s been 2 months since my ex fiancé left me. She moved here to be with me 6 years ago, 2 years ago I bought a house here and proposed to her. Our lives were totally intertwined and we wanted to spend them together forever. 

However, at various points in our relationship I’d had thoughts of cheating, I’d crave attention from other women and resorted to things like camgirls or Reddit chats behind her back to selfishly fulfill my fantasy. This was only occasional, but after proposing we had a talk about sexual fantasies and I realized by staying with her, I was committing myself to a pretty vanilla sex life potentially forever.

Our sex was great, but I was often the one to suggest new things. We’d watch porn together and talk about threesomes etc. I had it in my head that one day we’d experience those things together. After having the talk, I realized it was strictly fantasy for her.

This sent me spiraling. I questioned why I proposed when I had these desires that would go unfulfilled. We had other differences too that bothered me occasionally, but this sex seemed fundamental.

After that I acted differently towards her. I felt trapped in a relationship that wasn’t built to last. I felt like my needs were being neglected. I started chatting more with people online to get off, I neglected her a lot of time too and hid my feelings. I justified to myself that I wasn’t actually cheating, but deep down I knew it was wrong.

This went on for a few months before she caught me and confronted me. I opened up to her about what I was doing, she was heartbroken. She got us into therapy, I opened up more there. I broke down and admitted that I felt trapped with her and needed to experience sex with other people. I proposed an open relationship rather than a break up. She was totally against it then and we had no clue what to do.

I felt terrible about what I’d done. I stopped chatting with people, I tried to focus on rebuilding us back to where we were. I did all the small things I could think of like holding her hand, buying flowers, opening the car door for her, etc. I took us on cute dates, planned a special trip for her birthday. We set a date for our wedding and things seemed right.

Eventually she opens up to the idea of trying an open relationship. We started softly back in the spring, doing the same things I was doing before in private. We’d chat with people on Reddit, sometimes together and sometimes alone. It was fun and exciting, we both really enjoyed it.

After doing that for about a month, she asked what our next step was. I was fine going the pace we were, but told her we could try things in real life if she was ready. Obviously I was super excited, I’d been wanting this lifestyle for so long, and she was into it too. She suggested Feeld per her friend’s recommendation, and we made accounts.

She was quickly flooded with likes and potential dates to choose from. I struggled but tried to be patient. Eventually she set up her first date with a match. We talked everything through beforehand and agreed to talk about our feelings if anything became too emotional. The last thing we wanted was for this to tear us apart.

She goes on her first date and has a great time, ends up bringing him back to our place and we had an MFM. Totally fine with me, she enjoyed herself and the guy was fine.

As time goes on, she gets more dates. I still watch from the sidelines as I had one or two cancel on me. She goes back out with the first guy again, I sent her a goodnight/I love you text and asked her to let me know where she ends up. She replies with a hotel address and nothing else, it hurt me so deeply. I couldn’t sleep all night and stayed up crying, I tried to call and never got an answer. She came home and apologized and we moved on.

A week or 2 later she meets another guy for coffee and goes and sleeps with him without telling me first. This hurt me too, we argued about it a bit and moved on. After that, I met up with my first match and slept with her. I wasn’t crazy about her, but I needed the confidence boost because I felt like I was being left behind.

My ex then meets up with a guy she’s really into. They spent a whole day together but I tried not to let it bother me. After all, I felt like I owed her because of how poorly I’d treated her a year prior. She comes home and tells me how well her date went, I felt happy for her. Her original goal with opening the relationship was to find a secondary partner for when I wasn’t around, and he had potential.

A couple of days later, she sends me a picture at work of her teleworking at his house. It caught me off guard because we hadn’t talked about it, but I let her do her thing. She starts talking about wanting to introduce him to our pet, take him to places near the house, etc. I still don’t think much of it, I even suggested becoming friends with him.

She quickly plans a 3rd day with him and I a tell her it’s too fast for me. I break down crying and she assures me she’s not trying to leave me. I foolishly believed her.

A week or so later, my sister comes to visit. While we’re with her, my ex is stuck in her phone texting the new guy. I told her she needs to respect our time with family and she apologizes. Otherwise things seemed fine, my sister even shopped for wedding dressed with her.

The week, after things changed. She messages me while I’m at work and says she’s feeling weird things and wants therapy. I push back and suggest we talk about things together before moving back to therapy, my mistake. 

Shortly after she tells me she wants a break. I’m beyond crushed, I break down. I spend days begging her to stay. She refuses and says she needs it for herself. She moves out of our room, I can see him blowing up her phone while she’s setting up the air mattress. I had no idea what to do.

For about a week I stop sleeping and eating well, she’s coming and going as she pleases and I’m completely miserable. She refuses to hug or kiss me and spends all her free time with him. He was her new best match and I was old news, I couldn’t believe it.

One night she comes home and we argue. I beg her to stay and promise to fix things. No luck. I go to bed, she wakes me up crying a few hours later in severe pain. I care for her as she’s screaming, crying, throwing up etc. We ended up going to the ER and I stayed up all night with her while she had to have surgery. Part of me thinks this is perfect timing, that this will bring us closer together. I call her family and work with the surgeons etc. we kiss and say I love you before they put her under anesthesia.

The next day in recovery, at some point she plays a voice message from the new guy and starts texting him right in front of me. I couldn’t fucking take it, I begged her to choose me, told her I wanted to be her protector for life. I told her she can’t keep using me for rent while going out with him. She asks me to leave, so I did. I went home and left her alone. I was so emotionally and physically broken after the constant lack of sleep and eating along with her actions taking a toll on me mentally. 

I drop her keys off the next morning, thinking she’d be fine to drive home, apparently she was not. While I’m at work, she calls the new guy to pick her up. After that she was done. She moves out and quickly finds her own apartment and moves out.

During all this I started to invade her privacy and read her journals for answers. Her latest entries were about how she felt better around him than me. How he was telling her things romantically that she’d begged me to say for years. It hurt to read, and to know she kept these feelings from me.

We spoke once after that, she called me a narcissist and said he knew her better than I ever have. She told me she was probably going to be the best thing that ever came into my life.

It’s officially been one month no contact and I’m still completely in shock. Everything happened so fast. She’s with him now, and I have no one. I’m in our house alone, with no family in state. I feel so betrayed, lied to, and hurt. I know I hurt her too, but I stayed and tried to work on it. This is the most pain I’ve ever felt in my life.

**INTENTIONS**  
I live a somewhat atypical lifestyle and am on the lookout for open-hearted people to spark long intimate connections with. I'm eager to interact through deep platonic conversations, laughter-filled playdates, and intense romantic encounters. Chatting about or indulging ABF without judgment is important to me, but hey, that’s just one part of me—so it doesn’t come up much in my profile!

**TRAVEL**  
I’m your excuse to be a tourist in your own town! I’m lucky to travel a lot, usually spending a few months in each spot (with Vancouver and London being my bases). While my geography may have its limits, I’m all about making lasting relationships and discovering the best views, eateries, and hidden gems with interesting people!

**GOOD TO KNOW**  
Green flags: fit, healthy and playful  
Beige flags: not into watching sports  
Red flags: doesn't drink tea or coffee  
Subjective flags: no kids due to vasectomy

**ABOUT**  
I’m a mixed Afro-European; born in Zimbabwe then raised in England before moving to Canada. I'm the sort of person who orders food to share and gain energy from social settings—whether it’s a board game night, a walk to connect with someone new, or catching up with family. That said, I also enjoy cozying up with a good book!

Travel and adventure are my passions, and I’m lucky to work remotely while pet-sitting as a means to explore new places. You’ll often find me hiking, biking, or running local trails, but I love sharing those experiences with others. I’m always up for anything and enjoy being introduced to new activities, it really broadens my horizons!

I have a playful side, loving pranks and laughing at my mishaps but I also hold myself to high standards regarding personal growth. I'm certainly not perfect, but I try my best to be mindful during my interactions with people, animals or the environment especially when there is a chance to spread a little joy.

The best way to get to know me is to ask questions, because I'm a fairly open book!

**TOTALLY REAL REFERENCES**  
""He's my favourite child for a reason.""  
""Don't let him be the one who got away!""  
""He deserves a Nobel Prize in EQ.""

**VALUES**  
I believe life’s best moments come from unexpected connections! I’m a curious, open-hearted person and welcome interactions with people from all walks of life and identities. Most importantly; I’m stable, trusting, and non-judgmental in relationships.

**NOT AT ALL IMPORTANT STATS**

**ACKNOWLEDGEMENT**  
I’m grateful for my experiences with dry suckling and some experimentation with inducing. While I'm not shy in admitting a desire to explore lactation, I have no expectations for anyone to provide that just for me. What matters most is building relationships based on mutual trust and respect—milk or no milk!

**FAQ & CONVERSATION STARTERS**  
*What's you're proudest achievement?*  
I once hiked a mountain repeatedly until I hit the height of Mount Everest (8,800m / 29,000ft)! It took 20 hours to complete. Not too shabby, right?

*Do you ski or snowboard?*  
Yes! I'm lucky to be confident in both sports, although my preference may lean toward skis, unless there's fresh powder then it's snowboard all the way.

*Do you have any baggage?*  
Who doesn't? It’s more like carry-on size and I won’t bring it along to a first date. I was previously married which ended some time ago and since have found someone wonderful to share adventures with (see small print below).

*Do you have a claim to fame?*  
The British men's 2012 olympic leotards were modelled on my body. The actual team weren't interested so I was used as a stand in.

*What are you embarrassed about?*  
I'm a little ashamed that I used to pronounce Doritos as ""Doh-rit-ohs"" instead of ""Doe-ree-toes"". It's not a British thing like tomayto/tomahto, it's just me.

**SMALL PRINT**

1gt21hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gt21hf/help_me_decide_between_jura_z10_e8_or_kitchenaid/,"Help me decide between Jura Z10, E8, or KitchenAid KF7 or KF8","My current setup:

* When time is tight - I make my own cold brew.  I grind my own beans using a Capresso grinder.  It does the job, but it also makes a small mess that I have to clean up each time.
* On weekends or when I have more time - I make hot coffee using an Aeropress (with the fellow prismo attachment that gives it a nice crema on top).  Again, I'll grind my beans as above.
* For both options above, I usually add sugar or Splenda and half & half.  I've recently been playing with the liquid options (e.g. Torani and DaVinci and have been impressed).  
* I'm the only coffee drinker in the house, my wife drinks reduced calorie hot cocoa k-cups from the Keurig. 
* I typically only have one cup a day.  On rare occasions I'll have two.
* We host parties occasionally, only a few times a year.  

  
My reasons for looking:

* I'm really impressed with both the KitchenAid (KF8 mostly, but curious if the KF7 would work) and the Jura Z10 (and Jura E8 for that matter.)  I like the super automatic options that remove a lot of the manual steps I have above.
* I'd be curious to branch out into the milk-based options that both have to offer compared to the standard coffee's I make myself.  

  
Z10 Pros:

* For me it seems top of the line.  
* Cold Brew is a nice plus.  
* The jug could come in handy on those rare occasions.
* The Wi-Fi option to 'take orders' at parties would be a neat thing to show off - but again on are occasions. 

Z10 Cons:

* Price is an important factor but not necessarily a deal breaker.  It retails at $4,000 US.  I would try to find a deal - I have seen it on Amazon for $3,750 on occasion and would try to find a good deal.
* Maintenance/Upkeep might be something I need to think about.  I have filtered water, but they either want you to use their own filter or descale every so often, etc.  That could get annoying.  
* Accessories are expensive.  I would probably only get the regular milk jar for $50.  

  
E8 Comments:

* Can likely be had for much cheaper - let's say $2,400 for sake of argument. 
* You lose the cold brew option with the E8.  Not a deal breaker, but an important factor.
* You also lose the jug option, but I'm less concerned about that.



KF7/KF8 Comments

* Price plays an important factor - and it appears this can be had for a very good price.
* Reviews on it seem to be very positive from what I have found.
* No cold brew option.  
* I struggle to find major differences between the KF7 and KF8.  From what I can tell, it looks like the KF8 offers plant-based milk options, has a slightly larger screen, and offers one additional drink compared to the KF7.  Am I missing anything?  The one feature from that list I'd care about is the bigger screen on the KF8.  Is it worth the extra cost compared to the KF7?

  
TL/DR questions:  

* Is it worth waiting to find a decent deal on the Z10 to get cold brew options - or should I just continue to make my own cold brew and enjoy what the KitchenAid has to offer while saving some money?  ",3,1731805755.0,superautomatic,6,0.8,False

I (29M) met one of my former best friends Trixie (32F) when I was 18 at university in London, where we are from. Our families know each other, we've lived together, been on holiday together, used to speak every day etc.

During my 20s I was barely ever in the UK but we made an effort to visit each other at least once a year, wherever we were. 2 years ago, she met a woman (34F) in Spain and very quickly moved in with her and eloped (lesbians, right?)

That year I moved back to our hometown and Trixie came to visit. It was a good time but there were a few oddities like her telling me her wife made her delete Instagram for posting too much. Then seemingly out of the blue, her wife broke up with her via text. Naturally, she was distraught so I accompanied her through this and she stayed with me throughout her trip. 2 days later happened to be my birthday party and she was understandably a mess. Despite it being my birthday, most of the attention was on her but I let it slide because she had just gone through something quite traumatic. A week  later she took her flight back to Spain to talk to her wife and potentially get her things to move back to London.

For about a year, communication got quite sparse for the first time in our friendship. When I asked her about her wife or life plans, she avoided the subject so I gave her space. I assumed they had just gotten back together and she was a bit embarrassed as it probably wasn't the right thing to do.

Then last year she said she was coming to visit London again with her wife and the visit happened to coincide with my birthday so I was excited to see her and leading up to the trip, we started talking every day again. I invited everyone (around 20 people) for 3PM but asked close friends to come earlier for lunch at 1PM (including Trixie and her wife).  I didn't hear from Trixie all day so messaged at 3PM to ask. At 4PM, I got a nonchalant response ""Just having some lunch with the wife. Will come later"" I was annoyed but also quite occupied with my birthday festivities. Other friends kept asking about her so at 8PM, I nudged again and she said she was on her way but her wife was feeling a bit down. Then at 9PM she said she had arrived so would grab a coffee and then come and asked where we were. At this point I was a bit drunk and at a bar so I just said ""On my way home. I invited you 8 hours ago"", to which she didn't reply. I actually stayed out past midnight but just didn't want to deal with her, especially after she hijacked my birthday the year before. 

No communication until a week later, when I reached out to ask if she would be at a mutual friend's event, which she was. We didn't talk about my birthday and it was a bit awkward. And we haven't spoken since.

Tldr: My friend was messy on my birthday and the next year, she was about to turn up 8 hours late so I told her not to bother coming. No communication since. AITA?",1,1731805304.0,AmItheAsshole,4,1.0,False

How Would you vision a 4th Season of META RUNNER I liked the show started thinking about it again after read Ninja Turtles the Last Ronin(which I recommend reading for the 3rd time along with its  Prequel and Sequel) and Marvel 2099 comics by Steve Orlando(which I also recommend) and and the current Transformers comics by Skybound/Image Comics  because the setting of these comic reminded me of Meta Runner and made me think 

Which got me thinking how Would a Hypothetical 4th season of Meta Runner would be like you know since would be picking up where we Last left off the characters there probably be some plot points that need to be explored like how does Tari return to a physical body and what type of Villain should there be for 4th season personally I like season 4 to be basically ""Tari and friends"" at least for first half never really got that then Villain really shows up for the 2nd act so we can see the little moments like Tari getting Coffee and Silica City during the day and afternoon hours would be interesting to see 

Speaking of a Hypothetical season 4 should show more of the city like its park or something 

There's the fact Glitch has improved animation wise can you imagine how a season 4 would look like?

Rushing to do things feels less comfortable without the stimulants, but I'm only on day 15. I'll get used to it.

(Edit: that day we ended up at his place making out, just didn’t fully do it since I wanted to share std test results. The following week we’ve been texting a lot everyday.)

On Friday we were planning to meet on Saturday at gym. He’s curious about my gym and he prefers evening, so I changed my morning gym routine to meet him on Saturday night. On Saturday he didn’t check with me the whole day until I messaged him around 5pm saying I could get there around 7-8pm. Then he told me he forgot he had a birthday thing in the evening and can’t make it.


I’m okay with people changing plans, but I wish he had the courtesy to tell me earlier so that I could’ve gone to gym earlier in the day and made other plans for my Saturday night. Especially, HE is the one to make me change my schedule. 

A side note, after we planned for Saturday night, during the chat he probably realized I was serious about no sex before std testing and realized today there’ll be no sex. So a possible conspiracy theory is he didn’t want to meet when there was no sex. At this point I didn’t even know if he was really gonna get tested next week, from his flakiness so far. Or he didn’t want to continue at all so he didn’t bother to tell me about today until I reach out.

To me he is simply flaky and disrespectful, considering how he acted in these two months. However, I’d give him the benefit of doubt that his behavior might be acceptable in Brazilian culture.

What do you think?

Thanks everyone! Edit:

Not surprising that I’m not on his top list, which is fine, as he isn’t my top one and currently I’m not seeking a longterm relationship.

But, What bothers me the most is he doesn’t respect my time. I respect every single person with whom I have connections with, whether they’re my top priority or not. If I make a plan with someone, I stick to it, even if the person I like more wants to meet at the same time.

I’d like to be surrounded by people who are able to show basic respect to others regardless of interest level. I guess my mindset doesn’t fit casual sex reality.",6,1731805150.0,Brazil,46,0.69,False
