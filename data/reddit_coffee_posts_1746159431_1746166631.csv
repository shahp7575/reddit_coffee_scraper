1kcu33e,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1kcu33e/how_do_you_think/,How do you think?,"I was always very curious about what is going on in other people’s mind. Like when I watch a movie, and there is a scene basically narrating the thought process, it always seems very coherent and continious. 

For me however, that is rarely the case. Sure sometimes I’m also capable of that, e.g doing some math equations, I go like “okay so this equation has a logarithm in it, so I need to make sure the expression inside the log function is bigger than one etc etc…” but 90% of the times my mind is mostly blank. Or maybe not blank, but just filled with some “placeholders”. For example, I’m like “I want a coffee” so I go make one, but while doing so I don’t really think about stuff, it’s either some music playing in my head, or just repeating some silly things like “1,2,3…1,2,3” (still trying to figure out why lol, maybe the lot of phone usage?). 
And it was so weird for me when my friend said he barely has any peace of mind, because he is always thinking about something, making him stressed etc… and it’s hard to understand because I don’t even really know how people think about something for a long period of time. E.g In a meeting at work, when someone says “okay let’s think of some solution” I just sit there, with a blank mind, it’s either a solution pops up in my head, or nothing, but it is rarely a consequence of a series of coherent thoughts. 
Or when I try to decide if I should be together with a girl or not usually it’s only like this “well she is nice, I like spending time with her, she looks nice” and maybe a few more things but thats it, done in like 30 seconds, and I don’t know how people can go on and think about a specific subject for hours. Maybe this is the reason I have a hard time having long conversations with someone, because after a while my mind just goes blank and I can’t come up with anything to talk about (not filtering my speech, just literally sitting there staring at the distance and nothing comes to mind). 

When speaking, do you think about “okay what should I say next, should I say x, or should I say y, but I can’t say that because it would hurt him” or do you just start speaking and figure out the rest of your sentence along the way? (Which Is I guess why I lot of the times have to stop in the middle of the sentence thinking about the word I want to use, because I did not planned it before)

How does the process work for you? And is this normal?

1kcu2bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/SecretDreamsVolCamp/comments/1kcu2bg/welcome/,Welcome,"Hey everybody! Anybody?

I'm Marco, but I also go by Lux. This is my third year as a volunteer for Secret Dreams, and before that I was a volunteer at Resonance. Secret Dreams is kind of the continuation of Resonance, sort of kind of. The volunteer coordinators are the same, Jamie & Cait Lin, and they are awesome to work with

I'm a fairly experienced festie goer, stretching all the way back and before the first few Bonnaroos. Some have referred to me to as a Merry Prankster, or even one of them neo-Pranksters but disregard these rumors. I just happen to know some of them and have had the pleasure of hanging out with from time to time

  
Speaking of time, It's always a great time at Secret Dreams no matter where you are, but getting a campsite near the front saves a lot of time, as well as wear & tear on the old footsies & knees as those hilly gravel roads in General Admission are not the most forgiving. If you get put way way back in GA (which is not uncool!! There's a lot going on there back in the hinterlands of GA Camping, surprise and/or rogue stages, all kind of late-night fun, but if you are way, way back in GA then you're not running back to the campsite to get something you forgot. It can be like a 45 minute to an hour walk up and down hilly gravel roads just up to where you cross the highway to get on the venue grounds, and from there it's probably another ahlf-mile up to the gate. So we do want to get there nice & early and hopefully snag a spot right close to the road, and then it would be no biggie to run back to the campsite quickly. This is great for running up there near the front and grabbing a quick shower too.  And the closer we are (and the more people we have) the more likely that someone is going to be at the campsite at any given time, which is good for security. Secret Dreams *is* one of the best vibed festivals I've ever been to but unfortunately thieves are everywhere, so it's another good reason to be in a camp with fellow volunteers, who hopefully turn into good friends!!

For our best chance at getting a campsite reasonably close to the front, it's imperative we get there bright & early as possible on Wednesday July 16. We would need to meet up somewhere beforehand and go in as a group to assure we're all camped together. If we're well organized (and this is a big if) we may be acknowledged by the powers that be and get camped in a good spot. This benefits them as well, by the way, because it's easier for us to get to our shifts

  
Once we get in, and the parking attendants have moved on, we can  re-arrange our campsite to our liking, and to maximize space. If we have enough people a good option to park the cars on the perimeter with everybody camped within but we'll just have to work with what we've got

  
I have a quiet generator, which I need  to have looked at, but assuming it's still operational we can set up a charging station in our common area, and I can bring along a Keurig too, as I gots to have my coffee. Doing group meals is a great way to save time & money as well, and you gotta have at least one sponataneous late night/early morning feast, right? Unfortunately I am light on camp cook equipment although I plan to some yard sales soon to hopefully pick up a stove and other equipment

If you want to connect on Facebook, send me a PM and I'll send you the link although I think I'm easily findable if you search for Lux Marker Polo",1,1746166412.0,SecretDreamsVolCamp,0,1.0,False

1kctzym,https://i.redd.it/42210ns78bye1.png,"A Whisper That Went Unheard – A Tale of Silence, Secrets, and Emotional Consequences","Chapter 1

""Ms. Wardolf, you should replace your hearing aid, or your hearing could be affected,"" reminded Dr. Simon Jangger.

Melody Wardolf was in Simon's office right then, sitting across from him. She had just finished her shift as a nurse and hadn't even had time to change out of her scrubs yet.

""Thank you, Dr. Jangger. I understand,"" she said as she nodded.

Simon sighed. ""Ms. Wardolf, according to your latest check-up, I think it's best you get a cochlear implant as soon as possible. The surgery isn't that expensive nowadays. Everything, including recovery, will only cost about 600 thousand dollars.""

He paused, and his smile became even gentler. ""That kind of money is nothing to your family, so there's no reason to drag it out.""

When Melody first started out at the hospital, the Wardolf family had donated two imported machines to them, so everyone knew that the Wardolfs were loaded.

After leaving the office, Melody took out her phone and used the banking app to check her account balance. It showed ""$56,005.83"".

This was all the money she had saved this past year.

Simon was right. 600 thousand dollars was nothing to the Wardolf family, but it was an astronomical sum for her.

Melody was adopted by the Wardolf family. From a young age, she could only have what the Wardolfs voluntarily gave her, and she needed to show her sincere gratitude in return.

If they hadn't given her something, she was not allowed to ask for it. Otherwise, she'd be seen as ungrateful and not knowing what was good for her.

By the time Melody changed out of her scrubs and got home, it was nearly 7:00 pm.

The weather had been quite gloomy lately in Jembina. There were constant light showers, causing people to feel sluggish.

Melody didn't live in the Wardolf residence. She stayed at an apartment near the hospital.

She had just opened the door when she noticed the light in the entryway was on. She froze.

Jeremy Chesson was home.

She slowed her movements and carefully checked whether any raindrops or mud had splattered on her.

Jeremy was a well-known miracle worker at Jembina Hospital. He was also the youngest doctor to become the lead surgeon in the neurosurgery department.

He had severe germaphobia and could not tolerate even the slightest dirt.

He also happened to be Melody's fiancé.

In order to help them foster their relationship, the Wardolfs and the Chessons allowed Melody to move in with Jeremy.

After all, it was only because of an accident that they were engaged in the first place.

Melody cleaned herself up before entering. The light in the entryway was on, but the one in the living room wasn't.

However, she could still see a person on the couch. It seemed like Jeremy was asleep as he hadn't shown any reaction to her moving around.

Melody walked up to him and saw that his eyes were closed. While looking at his face, she couldn't help but notice his long, thick eyelashes.

Jeremy's nickname at the hospital was Neuro God. Not only did he have such godly skills that he reached the position of lead surgeon at such a young age, but he also had a godlike appearance.

Jeremy was extremely handsome. He was so good-looking that Melody only dared to stare at him when he was asleep.

She hadn't seen him in quite a while. He went overseas to attend an academic conference and had only returned two days ago. When he returned, he had to perform a major surgery, spending about six or seven hours in the operating room both yesterday and today.

There were faint dark circles under his eyes, and his brows were furrowed slightly, appearing as if he wasn't getting a restful sleep.

The living room window was open, and the cold wind mixed with splatters of rain blew in.

Jeremy only had a shirt on. Melody's eyes fluttered, and her gaze fell on her small blanket that was sitting on the armchair.

She hesitantly reached for the blanket. For some reason, she did not dare to proceed further. She then planted herself down on her armchair, clutched the blanket close to herself, and fixed her gaze on Jeremy once again.

She knew he was tired, so she didn't want to wake him. He rarely had much time to rest.

However, right then, his phone on the coffee table started buzzing. Melody flinched, and she reached her hand out instinctively to mute it.

That was when a low voice sounded. ""What are you doing?""

Melody spun around, and she found herself locking eyes with Jeremy. Her heart lurched.

Jeremy's eyes were big and bright even in the dimly lit living room. His expression was blank as he continued to stare at her.

Melody had completely frozen. She stammered in a soft voice, ""I… I wasn't going to do anything. I just saw you sleeping, so… I…""

She wanted to explain, but she was so nervous that she was getting tongue-tied.

Jeremy's gaze shifted downward, stopping at her outstretched hand. Melody followed his gaze, suddenly feeling as if her right hand was scalded.

She abruptly pulled her hand back and helplessly wiped her fingers on her sleeves, as if her fingers were dirty.

She then looked back up at Jeremy and said cautiously, ""I… I didn't touch your stuff.""

Jeremy raised his head as Melody continued to stand there, dazed.

A flash of indifference crossed his emotionless eyes.

""Don't touch or even get close to any of my things. How many times do I need to repeat myself?""

Melody was at a complete loss. She wanted to explain, but she didn't know where to begin. She had never been good with words.

Before she moved in, Jeremy had stressed that she was not allowed to touch any of his belongings.

Even though they had lived together as an engaged couple for over half a year, everything in the apartment was clearly labeled. She could only touch the things that had her name on it. Everything else was off-limits.

She wasn't even allowed into the areas where Jeremy hung around the most. Just like in this large living room, the only thing she was allowed to use was this small armchair.

He really did have severe germophobia.

Jeremy glanced at his still-buzzing phone, and his eyebrows furrowed with clear displeasure. However, he held it in and answered the phone.

Before the person on the other end could speak, he ordered, ""Help me buy a new phone and send it over immediately.""

He then glanced at the couch before continuing, ""Also, find someone to replace the couch and do another round of disinfections.""

He had said all that while maintaining a blank expression.

Melody followed his gaze. That was when she realized that a small corner of her blanket had ended up resting on Jeremy's couch.

She lowered her gaze, not daring to speak or even look at him. Instead, she stared at her right hand. Then, she slowly hid both her hands behind her back.

Her left hand rubbed her right hand vigorously. She wanted to tell Jeremy that she wasn't dirty.

Chapter 2

The air around Jeremy was frigid.

Melody stood stiffly in the living room, not daring to move a single muscle. She pursed her lips and even made her breathing shallower.

Everything about her was tense. It was as if she were a child who had done something wrong and was now waiting for her punishment.

As for Jeremy, he had promptly hung up the phone after speaking, then stood up to leave.

When he walked past Melody, he didn't stop or even spare her a glance, only leaving a soft breeze in his wake.

The front door opened, then closed again. Only the light in the entryway was still on, attempting to bring some brightness into the dimly lit living room.

Melody was left standing alone in the middle of the living room. She knew that Jeremy had likely returned to the hospital.

It wasn't the first time something like this had happened. They lived together, and as careful as Melody tried to be, there were still times when she accidentally touched his things.

There was once when Melody was cleaning the house and accidentally touched the glass that Jeremy regularly used. He then had someone replace everything in the house with new ones. Melody's belongings were also disinfected thoroughly.

Jeremy didn't return to the apartment for a whole month after that incident.

At the time, Melody was still clueless as to why. It was not until she was at the hospital that she overheard a colleague teasing Jeremy for being so dedicated to his work that he had not gone home for the past few days.

Jeremy answered nonchalantly, ""Someone touched my stuff and got them dirty.""

That was when Melody finally realized that Jeremy had such disdain for her.

Since then, she developed the habit of being extra cautious lest she touched anything of his again.

The rain continued for quite a long while.

Melody had assisted in a surgery earlier that day and was feeling quite tired. She didn't even have dinner and went straight to bed after washing up.

When she woke up the next morning, the place was the same as the night before. Everything was still quiet.

Jeremy clearly had not returned after leaving.

While washing up, Melody stared at herself in the mirror. Simon's words from the day before rang in her head.

Her hearing impairment wasn't a birth defect.

The Wardolfs were actually quite good to her. Andrew Wardolf, her adopted father, bought her the hearing aids she was currently using. They were a gift to celebrate her acceptance into Jembina School of Medicine.

The Wardolfs were great benefactors to her. She would never dare to ask for anything more.

After Melody got to the hospital and completed the shift change, she went to her patients' rooms to measure their blood pressure. On her way back to the nurse's station, she saw that the doctors were preparing to start their rounds.

It was a Monday, so rounds started a little later than usual.

Melody immediately caught sight of Jeremy standing amongst the crowd. He was wearing his white coat, and his eyes were lowered as he listened to the person beside him speak.

In this department, the experienced doctors weren't as young as him, and those younger than him weren't as capable. Thus, despite standing in a crowd, anyone would still notice him at first glance.

After what happened the night before, Melody felt a little nervous to see Jeremy.

The group of doctors stood in front of the nurse's station, blocking her way forward. So she lowered her head and stayed quiet, planning to wait for the doctors to leave before returning to her station.

That was when the head nurse saw her and called out, ""Melody, are you done taking the patients' blood pressure?""

Melody nodded. ""Yes, there are no changes, but the patient in Bed 29 has a fever. The patient's family asked me to get a doctor to check.""

""How's the older gentleman in Bed 4?""

Melody checked her notes before answering carefully, ""Everything looks normal, and he's also not resisting treatment anymore. However, he is constantly asking when he can be discharged.""

Suddenly, a low voice sounded beside her. ""The patient in Bed 4?""

Melody pursed her lips ever so slightly before she turned to Jeremy.

""Yes, the one with the acute cerebral infarction.""

""I know,"" Jeremy interrupted, his dark eyes focused on her. ""Why did you say he was resisting treatment?""

The older gentleman in Bed 4 was admitted after Jeremy had left for his conference. After resuscitating him, the man rejected further treatment as he believed that he was merely a burden should he continue to live.

Before Melody could respond, another doctor jumped in.

""Dr. Chesson, you don't know how difficult that patient has been. We've dispatched nearly everyone in this department, but no one was able to change his mind, at least not until Ms. Wardolf here. Thank goodness for her.

""Ms. Wardolf has a good personality and is good-tempered, too. It's no wonder all the patients in our ward like her,"" the doctor praised with a smile.

Melody only lowered her head and didn't respond.

After a while, though, she murmured softly, ""It's all part of the job.""

Though her head was lowered, she stood upright. Her scrubs were clean and neat, as if they were brand new.

Melody could feel a certain gaze on her. She pursed her lips and tried to appear calm and collected.

Since starting in this department, she had always been the most responsible one. It was because she wanted to do better whenever she was in front of him.

Even if that gaze would only linger on her for a second before shifting away, she still wanted to excel and be more diligent. At least, she wanted him to think she wasn't that bad.

However, in the next second, Jeremy spoke up, sounding apathetic.

""As medical personnel, it's our duty to do everything we can to save our patients. So there's nothing to applaud here.""

The air surrounding them seemed to freeze. Melody unconsciously clenched her fingers as she responded softly, ""I understand.""

By the time she looked up, Jeremy had already turned to leave. She only caught a glimpse of his cold-looking side profile.

Most working at the hospital knew Melody and Jeremy were engaged. After all, when Melody first started work, the Wardolf family had made donations to the hospital to bolster their reputation. It even ended up on the news.

A close colleague couldn't help but feel sorry for her.

""Dr. Chesson is too unfeeling. How could he say that?""

Melody pursed her lips while she worked on her paperwork. In the end, she still spoke up for him.

""He's right. It is our duty to treat patients, so there's nothing to make a fuss about.""

""Goodness, Melody. You're always defending Dr. Chesson, regardless.""

Everyone in the department knew that Melody was Jeremy's biggest fan. No matter what he did, she would always be the first to support him. Even when, most of the time, he didn't even need her to do so.

Someone once joked that while others might be idealistic or materialistic, Melody was only ever Jeremy-istic. No one dared repeat these jokes in front of Jeremy because everyone knew that Jeremy did not like Melody.

More accurately, Jeremy didn't even pay an ounce of attention to her.

Chapter 3

That afternoon, Melody received a call from Andrew right as she finished her work.

""Dad,"" Melody greeted respectfully.

""Come over to Regallo Villas tonight. I have something to discuss with you.""

""Okay."" Melody was always meek and obedient toward the Wardolf family.

""Bring Jeremy with you.""

Melody did not have a chance to respond before Andrew hung up the phone. The dial tone that followed sounded unfeeling and impatient, like it was rushing her.

She looked toward the direction of the doctors' offices, hesitating slightly.

In the end, she headed over. Just as she was about to knock on the door, Harold Franklin walked up next to her.

Harold was none other than the doctor who had praised her earlier that day. He had a patient's file in hand and smiled at Melody when he saw her.

""Ms. Wardolf, are you here to see Dr. Chesson?""

Melody nodded. ""Yes, I've something to tell him.""

Harold handed the file over to her. ""Everyone's gone to grab a bite. He should be inside resting. Since you're going in anyway, could you hand Bed 4's patient file to him? The chief is waiting to discuss something with me.""

Harold had spewed out the words rather quickly, seeming to be in a real rush. While he was at it, he even opened the door for Melody before he turned around and left.",1,1746166139.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

1kctyyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kctyyx/i_clogged_my_crushs_toilet/,I clogged my crush's toilet,"So there was a guy (let's call him Luke) and I had this juicy crush on him. Anyway, for one of our classes we were randomly assigned as partners to work on a project together (the universe truly loves me).

I did, however, realise that Luke didn't even know who I was, which was incredibly humbling, so therefore I also pretended that I didn't know who he was (he didn't care).

A few days later, we decide to meet up and work at his place. I was so excited that I literally got a max of one hour of sleep the night before. However, this meant by the time it was morning, I was regretting everything. So I decided that because I didn't want to show up to his place looking like I had just been resurrected from the dead, I chugged down 2 energy drinks and 2 cups of coffee within an hour.

I also decided to take a quick shower before I left because I needed to smell fresh so he would fall in love with me. Perhaps due to the amount of caffeine I consumed, it had also affected my motor skills and my judgment, because I slipped and fell, right after getting out of the shower.

I literally thought my life was ending. But no, I survived, with a massive bruise on my leg. I told myself that it was fine (little did she know what awaited her) and threw on some nice clothes because I convinced myself this was a study date and he was actually in love with me.

Anyway, I arrive at his place and knock on his door. He opens it and looks at me strangely. I smile at him as a desperate attempt at human interaction. Then, he points at my face and says that I have a blood nose.

What.

I instantly touch my nose, and feel blood. Luke handed me some tissue and gestured for me to come in.

There I was, trying to look like a potential girlfriend, but my body was sabotaging me. After a few minutes it stopped and we sit on his couch, trying to work through the project, until my earlier caffeine intake decided to plot against me.

Not only did I develop the worst stomach pain that made me wonder if I was experiencing some medical emergency, I also had to use the bathroom. Badly. I tell him that I have to quickly use his bathroom and then went running inside.

Clearly I was in there for a while because he asked if I was alright. I replied that I was (I wasn't). Anyway, after sitting on the toilet for however long, my excretory system finally calmed. I go to flush the toilet. It made some strange noise which made me wonder when they started creating toilets that sound like that. I try to flush it again. Nothing happens.

At this point, I was panicking and the bathroom air which was filled with the remains of my digestive system was not helping. Luke checks on me again. I tell him that I would be out soon. There was no way I was telling a guy I really like that I may have potentially clogged his toilet. I wanted him to remember how intelligent I was, not how much can come out of my excretory system.

So I decide to take matters in my own hands. I successfully located a plunger, but perhaps it was my lack of life skills, or the fact that the bathroom was infused with the smells of my bodily contents, but as I go to pull up the plunger, the handle comes off and the plunger head is stuck inside the toilet. I was seriously contemplating climbing out of his bathroom window and running away.

After much deliberating, I decide to tell Luke. He's still sitting on the couch and I approach him with deep shame.

I tried to smile as pleasantly as I could, but from the concern on his face I became worried that he thought I was trying to steal his bathroom essentials. My heart started beating so rapidly when I told him that I may have potentially done something with his toilet, I genuinely believed I was about to experience heart failure.

He walks to the bathroom and stares at the toilet. I didn't realise my waste products were so interesting.

I explain to him that I tried to fix it using a plunger but clearly it didn't work. He told me that the plunger I was using was faulty and went to grab a different one. Eventually it did unclog but any ounce of dignity I had left was flushed down alongside everything else.

I apologise to him and he told me it was fine (it wasn't fine) and that it happens. We did eventually continue working on the project but we didn't go back to studying at his place again. At least he remembers my name now! ",2,1746166025.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

There were many factors that went into this decision, the AI-first policy that Duo presented was just the final nail in the coffin.

Now then, let's start this crap-show, shall we? Get a cup of coffee ready (or whatever other snack you're craving), because here begins this essay of goodbyes (hey, maybe this is good practice for my exams that are coming up, lol)...

>1. AI-first policies

[F\*\*\* off. Seriously, f\*\*\* off.](https://preview.redd.it/v7au1acmsaye1.png?width=597&format=png&auto=webp&s=3eb5e887e037a2f8d52327ffd1514632f380cf0c)

Might as well get this one out of the way first and foremost. Yes, as we all know, recently Duolingo announced that they were going to completely do way with human contractors to pave the way to become an AI-first company. I've already noticed Duolingo teasing out AI for a while now. Think about all of the features that have been rolled out in recent years: Duolingo Max. Lily Voice Calling. Those Super Duolingo ads featuring AI-generated voices of the characters (while we're here, can we talk about how AWFUL Eddy and Falstaff's voices sound in AI form? They really took my two favorite characters and crushed them). It honestly seemed like this was something that we should have been expecting for awhile.

Alas, it eventually came. I already was iffy with the whole Artificial Intelligence being used in subscriptions and everything. But turning your focus away from real human input into a machine (which, mind you, is bound to make much more errors than a native speaker of the language: think about it, how many times have you had to correct ChatGPT or some other chatbot because they completely glossed over what you were asking, burning down god-knows-how many forests in the process?) for the core features of your product is an absolute no. You are charging people dozens, some hundreds of dollar every month so they can recieve the same content that only takes some types on a keyboard to accomplish. Your app was built with people, Duolingo. You're really going to take away any last creativity you had with your community and your creative marketing with whatever machine slop is going to pump out of you?

In fact, recently I just heard that Duolingo recently added 150 new courses across all of their core app languages. What does the mastermind credit to his absolute success? Maybe it's his workers that he definitely pays fair wages and spent years mastering and perfect- *ofcoursenottheyusedai.*

ZDNET: ""Developing our first 100 courses,"" von Ahn explained, ""took about 12 years, and now, in about a year, we're able to create and launch nearly 150 new courses."" Instead of taking years to build a single course with humans, the company now builds a base course and uses AI to quickly customize it for dozens of different languages.

Genuinely, f\*\*\* off.

It goes without saying I am a serious hater of generative Artificial Intelligence, especially in the field of art, education, and literature. I am a beginning artist with basic experience in sketch and digital art, so I am one of the people most impacted by the rise of AI and people using it to create s\*\*\*\*y minion memes that are heavily distorted and barely readable, rather than paying artists to make a s\*\*\*\*y minion meme with love (and much less energy). To see such a familiar face on the web go down the same copycat path as almost every other tech company out there is plain depressing. We truly are heading towards an AI-controlled Earth, aren't we? Will humanity see it's obsolescence?

...wait, what was this post about?

>2. Lack of support

[Look at all of those sad, undersupported courses...](https://preview.redd.it/tzad004m6bye1.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=f4a0da9f2a086b374f79b2d168d1cbf0467d9799)

So, why does Duolingo care so deeply for Artificial Intelligence in the first place, anyways? To attract investors over their consumers, yes. ""WOAH LOOK AT US! WE CAN USE AI TOO! AREN'T WE JUST SO COOL?! GIVE US YOUR MONEY!!!"" However, I feel like another motivation for them to employ this absolutely AmAzInG technology ~~that hasn't been done by millions of people trying to save a quick buck or two~~ is to attempt to fill the hole with any language that isn't Spanish.

I've already explained in the above paragraph why this is such a terrible idea. This is not how you fix your solutions, Duolingo.

AI-banter aside, this was equally disadvantageous for those who are like absolutely new to any language, even if they just want to take a few lessons just to get a general feel of it. When you open the Spanish course, from the first lesson you receive guides that teach you the basic sounding blocks, basic vocabularly, basic word choice, basic allat. That is actually quite helpful, especially for an absolute beginner, even if they just took out their phone and decided one day ""You know what? I think I want to start learning Spanish today!""

I also saw some of this for Japanese, though not quite as much as I did for Spanish. In fact, and this is more opinion based than anything, I honestly think the course should begin with you learning some of the most common Japanese characters first before anything. Yes, they do translate the characters for you as you learn the words. But this way, the characters don't really stick with you, at least from my experience. The site also does not stress the importance of learning hiragana and katakana alongside the words right away, only having a few character lessons along the main path and placing lessons dedicated to the characters on a seperate tab. Perhaps the biggest peeve is the lack of kanji access right away; for those of you who do not know, kanji is one of THE most important scripts in the Japanese language, yet also one of the more complex. Several words and phrases use kanji or even have a kanji character dedicated to them as a whole. I find it ridiculous that you even have to wait before you can at least try and dip your toes to get a basic feel of arguably one of the most important parts of learning such a complicated language.

Now then, this is where the main complaint comes in. If you somehow recognize me from before I made this post, you may recall the three languages I was learning with this app (not counting languages I merely had an interest in and only did a few lessons for fun) were Spanish, Japanese, and my personal favorite to tell people I learn, Esperanto. For those of you who are not aware, Esperanto is a constructed language, which unlike some languages that date back to hundreds to thousands of years ago, Esperanto only dates b back to the late 1800s, invented to be the global language that everyone could learn and speak. Obviously, it never accomplished its goal (and you could argue English became that language), but it is still quite a fun language to learn, and not to mention useful as a whole when learning languages, especially many romance languages (you'll be able to make connections from both English and Esperanto vocabulary!). Esperanto uses a slightly modified alphabet, for those of you who don't know.

Does Duolingo tell you anything about these added characters? I mean, they tell you about Spanish vocabularly and Ja- *notheydon'ttellyouaboutesperantoanythingwhywouldthey.*

Esperanto is one of MANY languages where there is VERY little provided guidance on the flow, vocabulary, and other gists of the language that are pretty important to know before you even learn the most basic of words. There are absolutely no guides to teach you how to pronounce ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ. I had to learn all of these myself along the way, and as it turned out I had been pronouncing several words wrong for my entire journey.  This isn't the only language that suffers. Last I checked, all languages that I had an interest in and decided to do a few lessons for a basic experience: Indonesian, Klingon, Russian, Polish, NONE of these languages had ANYTHING to guide you through pronounciation, style, flow or pronounciation (which was an especially fatal mistake in Klingon and Polish, which are NOTORIOUSLY known for having VERY complicated pronounciation (try pronouncing cześć (P) and jIyajbe' (K) in one go) and in the case of Klingon sentence structure (it's object-verb-subject!)), so you will definitely find yourself losing many hearts and being forced to repeat the same lesson over and over and over and over with that lack of understanding...

Aside from the lack of such a helpful feature, not all languages enjoy the same benefits. Again, it seems like Spanish is the golden child of languages that Duolingo offers. It gets all of the awesome features promised with Super and their new InNoVaTiVe subscription, Max. However, if you aren't learning Spanish (and in some cases French I think?), you're basically being ripped off (ESPECIALLY MAX). Not all languages enjoy the same benefits. So much for the so-called learning faster, eh Duo?

>3. User-unfriendliness

This is a bit of a controversial one. As we all know, the green owl cares about one thing and one thing only: ~~INVESTOR PROFITS~~ PEOPLE MAINTAINING THEIR STREAK. So, why would I think Duolingo has a problem with this sort of issue?

Think back to what I said above. You know how the golden child of languages is Spanish (and okay, I guess French...)?

Against user support, Duolingo has intentionally shown their smaller languages no love. They pride themselves in being able to teach their userbase dying languages, such as Hawaiian, Navajo, and Welsh. Aww, how sweet? Who wouldn't want to learn a language on Duolingo and support their mission to save such a dangerously endangered part of culture from wiping off this face of Earth?

Duo. Duo doesn't want to support their own mission, apparently. I'm sure some of you may remember when Duolingo officially announced that they were ending further updates on their Welsh course, leaving it pitifully incomplete with the same issues I complained about above. The same goes for their Navajo and Hawaiian courses, which have been in an incomplete, beta state for as long as I can remember, despite several loading screen tips bragging about their website being able to teach you ""endangered languages."" If Duolingo was so proud of itself for teaching languages that may see their end soon, why would they leave their courses in a state where you would be able to get very little out of it? The answer: once again, to show to their people ""hey look at us! we teach this language! buy super! invest in us!""

Of course, people noticed this and weren't silent. When the Welsh course's plug was pulled, of course people were like ""wait a minute, this wasn't what we wanted!"" Especially being at a time when it seemed like the future of the language was so uncertain, with their own government lessening their approach at getting their language back into common use once again. The owl of course, didn't care, because the owl did what it wanted.

This isn't the only example of user-unfriendliness that came to mind. Here comes the worst part: the heart system. In addition to the flaws I've already mentioned which make it harder for you to keep your hearts in the less-supported languages, the heart system as a whole is a flawed method to encourage people to learn a language. Yes, while one could argue it adds to the whole ""gamification"" aspect of the app (which, although fun, now that I think about it, is that even an effective way to learn a language?), it punishes you for making mistakes. As someone who has constantly struggled to learn Spanish, mistakes, though of course not enjoyable, are an essential part of the learning journey. The hearts system discourages people from doing such mistakes, and therefore allows for less learning opportunities. So, what do you do if you want to learn without feeling bad for yourself that you got ""pero"" and ""perro"" mixed up? GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY, OBVIOUSLY!

As we all know, Duolingo is one that has removed beloved features and replaced them with something people could care less about. I'm sure a lot of you who joined the platform around the same time I did remember the fourms and comments underneath every question, where people could discuss the answer, correcting each other, clarifying for newer learners, and even pointing out whenever Duo themselves made a mistake which needs to be corrected. Why did Duolingo remove such a beloved community-focused tool that could be used to potentially help others out and make new friends who are learning the same language as you? I feel like I don't even need to say it, but it rhymes with Kotringo Fax.

The leaderboard system. I feel like I don't even need to explain why this is a bad idea. When you give a mobile app/game leaderboards, do you ever notice how there's some guy named ""ILoveDoods123"" who somehow has the best score at 0:00:01 seconds? That happens every day in the higher tier leagues, especially diamond. It makes the effort of even trying to get to the top discouraging, not to mention there's a good chance people play the same lessons over and over and over again just to get to the top. It's not a good tool to help you learn a language, and I really wish there was an option to turn it off. Too late now.

>4. Marketing

[Stay down, owl.](https://preview.redd.it/v9qn81dxsaye1.png?width=365&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7a021358757d51a6451d976553b07efec7e41a8)

This one should be obvious and I think it's a perfect way to cap this all off. We all know Duolingo got love in recent weeks from their quirky advertising, which many people thought was funny and hilarious, especially for fitting in with what our generation (Generation Z, and to an extent α) watches on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, or anywhere else where you can find short form video. I will admit, some of their advertising campaigns were funny, especially the mascots and bringing their characters for life.

I'll give Duolingo credit on one of their most creative marketing ideas yet: their very own authentic Mexican restaurant, Duo's Taqueria. While I've never been to it myself, I've heard many great things about this place. The food is authentic, the atmosphere is fitting and sophisticated, and you could even get free food if you had a streak on the app. This is an extremely creative idea from the company, especially given the fact that the restaurant is permanent and not some quick pop up stunt.

Now that I've learned more about the app and company itself, however, all of their ""unhinged"" advertising just seems sad. It all feels like a huge effort to hide what is truly going on behind this app that promises language learning, when you mainly just get the basics and not much else. A distraction, if you will. Think back to the time when Duo supposedly ""died."" They changed the app icon, made some witty announcement on all of their socials, hell, it even became a meme. Looking back at that fiasco, the meme just feels forced as hell. It felt like a big, forced tool in order to get more people hooked on an app that will soon start feeding it's audience inaccurate AI-taught learning.

Notice how many brands were so big on the ""meme,"" too. Yes, the general public found it funny for a while, but eventually it felt more and more forced, with the only people really making more of a fuss out of it being other brands to sell their own products; hell, I'd be convinced they were paid by Duolingo, it almost has to be the case.

The characters probably hurt me the most, however. Duolingo managed to nail giving their characters personality and creativity despite the corporate-esque artstyle. Just think about the art you've seen of everyone's favorite pair: Zari and Lily, the two polar-opposite best friends. Now, however, they've been given AI voices and with all of the company's practices and policies just don't feel anywhere near as lifelike as Duolingo wanted them to be. They just feel sad now that I know all about the app itself and the company behind it.

They're not trying to be hip or relatable with you, they're trying to draw in your attention so they can get their hands on your money for that sweet, sweet AI funding. Their marketing strategies are considered ""effective"" for a reason, and not just because they're entertaining.

Most importantly, as I've already said, they've now become more or less a tool to draw people in without them knowing what they are getting themselves into, complete with AI voices and animation nowhere near as creative as they once were. I wouldn't be surprised if they soon started to create AI memes in the future, either. Any of the creative energy that was once associated with these characters and animations now feels little more than a shadow of what the app was all about.

>Conclusion

[this will be duolingo in 2025 \(actual ad I found for some AI content farm website btw\)](https://preview.redd.it/bjj183qouaye1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=303c6fa0c2c76cb85dffc59348138ff3a0e54089)

Well, I think I've said all that I need to say. After 6 long years with this app, it's finally time to say goodbye and take my journey elsewhere. Goodbye, Duolingo. I'll never forget installing you two months before my first international trip to Italy (and Vatican City) to teach me the basics of Italian. I'll especially never forget a year ago, when my trip to Japan inspired me to commit to learning not just Japanese, but Spanish and Esperanto, and eventually even got me interested in learning Russian, Polish, Indonesian, and even Klingon in the future (future polyglot in the works?). But I will forget how much of my time you wasted making me think I was actually going to get anywhere remotely conversational with this app. Weeks and months with you and I still can't even respond to basic phrases that I should have learned with you already. I'm finally free from the owl's threats.

**TL;DR: I'm deleting my Duolingo account after nearly 6 years of using it. I cannot learn a language on nor trust a platform that prioritizes investor profits from AI and ""hip"" marketing while simultaneously showing no respect for their users and failing to deliver what they promise you will achieve.**

Luke Munoz cheated.



Vespera Gildon stood outside the president's office, her body stiff as if encased in ice. Her black stilettos seemed to merge with the dark marble floor beneath her.



After a long pause, she finally raised her hand and knocked on the door.



A deep, familiar voice responded from inside. ""Come in.""



Vespera tightened her grip on the documents in her hand and pushed the door open with the other. As she stepped inside, she forced a faint smile onto her face and approached Luke.



""Are you busy? There are a few urgent documents that need your signature."" Even as Vespera asked, she had already placed the papers before him, flipping them open to the pages that required his signature.



Luke had just returned from a business trip to Shawford earlier that morning. He had come straight to the office to tackle the mountain of work waiting for him. His desk was cluttered with files, and his handsome, well-defined face bore traces of exhaustion.



Without even glancing at the documents, he signed them quickly. ""Thanks for your hard work.""



Vespera gathered the signed papers and asked, ""Will you be home for dinner tonight?""



""I have plans tonight. You don't need to wait for me,"" he replied without looking up.



""Okay. I'll head out then."" Vespera turned and walked away, clutching the documents. As she did, her smile faded into a cold, mocking expression.



As Vespera passed the restroom in the office, a faint sound reached her ears. It seemed like a small animal jumping off the bed and landing on the floor.



Her gaze swept over the couch area, where a few snack wrappers and a half-finished milk tea lay on the coffee table. On the floor, a pastel pink high heel lay tipped over.



Everything became clear instantly. Her heart turned cold, crumbling into ash.



Vespera returned to her office. The short walk back drained all her energy. When she finally sat down, she let out a long, weary sigh.



She pulled one document from the stack in her hands. It was a divorce agreement.



Flipping to the last page, Vespera traced the lines of his signature with a mocking expression, her mind flashing back to memories.



Luke vowed to marry Vespera back then. However, Vespera's mother-in-law warned her not to get too comfortable, as no man could stay loyal to one woman forever.



Vespera was naive enough to believe they were different. But what difference was there?



Luke had cheated on her with a young woman. He was convinced he was hiding it well, indulging in the thrill of his affair. He had even brought her along on his business trip to Shawford. And now, he had brought her back to the office.



Vespera withdrew her finger and snapped a photo of the signed divorce agreement. She then sent it to her mother-in-law, Fiona Reeds, with a simple message. ""He signed it.""



A week ago, Vespera had struck a deal with Fiona. She demanded that Vespera initiate the divorce and keep their secret marriage hidden from the public. In return, Vespera had asked for a billion-dollar settlement.



In a month, Luke would be completely out of her life.



Just then, a knock on the door interrupted her thoughts.



After keeping the divorce agreement, Vespera said, ""Please enter.""



The door opened, and Luke's assistant, Osbert Madron, stepped inside.



""Ms. Gildon, Mr. Munoz asked me to pass this to you,"" Osbert said, placing a dark green velvet box in front of her.



Vespera casually opened the box and found an expensive diamond jewelry set. But the first thing that flashed through her mind was a dazed, short-haired girl in a bathrobe, carelessly holding up a diamond necklace. The room bathed in dim, suggestive lighting, the bed rumpled, and the girl's chest marked with unmistakable love bites.



A wave of nausea churned in her stomach.



""Thank you, Mr. Madron.""



Osbert felt a chill run down his spine when he saw Verspera's threatening gaze. He couldn't help but add, ""Mr. Munoz personally selected this. It's one of a kind in the world.""



It's too bad that Luke's heart wasn't one of a kind; she no longer wanted it.



Vespera smiled faintly. ""Really? How touching that he found time in his busy schedule to buy me a gift.""



Something in her voice didn't quite align. Osbert's unease deepened as he broke into a cold sweat. Did she know about Luke and Tina Sowle? He mumbled an excuse and fled from the office.



Vespera looked at the jewelry on the desk with disdain, as if it were filthy. She took out her phone, snapped a photo, and sent it to the owner of a luxury resale shop.



Then, she instructed, ""Sell this for me and donate the proceeds to the Foundation for Children with Intellectual Disabilities.""



The resale shop owner was speechless.



…



At 5:00 pm, Vespera had just reached her car and was about to open the door when her gaze casually swept across the parking garage. She noticed a car idling diagonally across from her.



Through the window, she saw Luke in the backseat, a short-haired woman nestled close to him. The woman had a round, cute face and radiated youthful energy.



""Mr. Munoz!"" Osbert gasped, slamming on the brakes.



Separated by glass and a stretch of space, Vespera's eyes found Luke's.



Chapter 2



Luke's eyes were dark and unreadable, while Vespera's were lifeless, devoid of emotion.



The atmosphere in the garage was tense.



Despite noticing Verspera, the woman didn't bother to distance herself from Luke. Instead, she grew even bolder, wrapping her arms around his neck and whispering something into his ear.



Vespera felt disgusted by the scene. She looked away, got into her car, and drove off without glancing back.



…



Shortly after arriving home, Vespera heard the sound of another car pulling up outside.



As she reached up to unfasten the clasp of her necklace before the glass cabinet in the walk-in closet, a towering presence loomed behind her. The man's commanding presence filled the small space, completely enveloping her.



His hands pressed against the glass cabinet, angling himself to study her face from the side. ""Are you angry?""



Vespera avoided his gaze. She took her time putting the necklace away before replying indifferently, ""I'm angry enough to kill. You'd better watch your back.""



Luke fell silent for a moment before speaking again. ""The Sowle family is interested in collaborating with us on the Polaris project. I've been in talks with Austin Sowle, their eldest son. That woman is his sister, Tina Sowle.""



""So if you don't entertain his sister, he won't work with you?""



""Vespera, I'm trying to explain. Don't be sarcastic.""



""I don't think it's necessary to explain."" Vespera finally turned to look at Luke. Her gaze seemed to pierce his soul. ""Luke, if you're tired of me and want to replace me as the lady of this house, I can step aside.""



Luke's expression darkened instantly. ""What did you say?""



She sighed and replied, ""We can get a divorce.""



As Vespera tried to push him away and leave, Luke yanked her back forcefully. Then, he gripped her face and warned, ""Don't even think about it.""



Vespera didn't respond. Not only had she thought about it—she had already taken action. She didn't want to be with him anymore.



Luke stayed home until late that night—until an unexpected phone call summoned him away. Vespera caught the faint sound of a tearful voice on the other end of the line.



…



The next morning, Vespera's lawyer and close friend, Rebecca Snyder, who was handling her divorce, sent her a screenshot. It was a new post from Luke's girlfriend—a photo of two hands, one noticeably larger than the other, forming a heart against a scenic sunrise. The caption read, ""When love greets the day"".



Vespera recognized the larger hand instantly—it was Luke's. She sat frozen, her fingers curled around a glass of water. She wasn't sure how long she had been gripping it.



The sharp, clear sound of the cup hitting the surface triggered a feeling of loss in Vespera. It was as if something within her had broken too.



Days passed, and Luke never returned home. Their only encounters were in company meetings—him at the head of the table, her among the executives. They didn't look at each other, and Vespera never once went to find him at his office either.



Instead, she filled her time searching for apartments and methodically discarding every gift he had ever given her—anniversary presents, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day tokens, wedding mementos. She even sold her wedding ring.

Ever feel like you're late to the crypto party and everyone else is making gains but you? Same. That’s why I’ve been poking around different platforms, trying to figure out what works for regular people who don’t want to spend 10 hours a day staring at candlestick charts. **[BTC Lexipro](https://tinyurl.com/4wzmydv8)** has been popping up in convos lately, and I finally decided to dive in and see what the hype is all about.

With the rise of automated trading platforms like **Bitcoin Code**, **Immediate Edge**, and now BTC Lexipro, it’s clear that many people are looking for a simpler entry point into crypto trading. These platforms claim to do the heavy lifting—analyzing markets, executing trades, and supposedly making your portfolio grow while you sleep.

In this review, I’ll break down **what BTC Lexipro actually does**, who’s behind it, how it performs, and whether it’s worth your time. If you’re on the fence or tired of getting burned by shady platforms, stick around. I’m laying it all out—**the good, the meh, and the “hmm, that’s interesting.”**

## What is BTC Lexipro?

BTC Lexipro is an **automated crypto trading software** designed to help users trade Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies without needing to manually analyze charts or execute trades. Think of it like your own digital trading assistant—it uses algorithms to scan the market, predict price movements, and place trades on your behalf.

The idea is that it takes the emotion and guesswork out of trading. For people who don’t have the time or expertise to trade full-time, this is a pretty attractive concept. BTC Lexipro claims to use **advanced AI and machine learning** to optimize trades and maximize profits.

It’s part of a growing trend of “hands-off” trading platforms that aim to make cryptocurrency accessible to the masses, not just Wall Street bros or tech nerds.

## Who Created BTC Lexipro?

This is where things get a little fuzzy. Like other platforms in this category (Bitcoin Code, Immediate Edge), **BTC Lexipro doesn’t make its founders publicly known**. There are mentions of a team of financial experts and AI developers, but no real names or LinkedIn profiles to go with them.

That’s not necessarily a red flag—many trading platforms operate anonymously to protect intellectual property—but it would’ve been nice to have some transparency here. If you’re someone who likes to “know the team,” this might be a sticking point.

Still, the platform seems to work similarly to others that have built reputations over time, suggesting it may be based on a proven model.

### [🔥 Start Trading with BTC Lexipro Today](https://tinyurl.com/4wzmydv8)
## How Does BTC Lexipro Work?

BTC Lexipro uses **algorithmic trading** to analyze the market in real-time and execute trades when it sees profitable opportunities. These algorithms are designed to react faster than any human could, picking up on trends and price movements before they fully unfold.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

- **Market Scanning**: The AI scans hundreds of assets and indicators.
- **Signal Generation**: Based on the data, it identifies potential trades.
- **Auto Execution**: Trades are placed automatically through partnered brokers.
- **Risk Management**: The system uses stop-loss and take-profit functions to manage risk.

You can also customize settings like how much to invest per trade, max daily trades, and more. If you’re more of a control freak like me, this is a nice touch.

There’s no native app, but the platform is **mobile-responsive**, meaning it adjusts nicely to smaller screens. I tested it on my iPhone and it was smooth sailing.

## BTC Lexipro – Supported Countries

Always check with the official website to confirm whether your country is supported. They usually notify you during the registration process.

## BTC Lexipro – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

BTC Lexipro’s AI engine is constantly scanning the crypto markets in real-time. **It processes huge amounts of data**, way faster than any human could, and uses that to spot trends and trading signals before they become obvious.

This means you’re not reacting to the market—you’re staying ahead of it (at least in theory). That’s a big deal in crypto, where things can flip in a matter of seconds.

### User-Friendly Interface

I really appreciate how **clean and simple** the dashboard is. You don’t need to be a tech wizard to figure it out. The layout is intuitive, and everything from setting up trades to checking balances is just a few clicks away.

Even if this is your first time trading, you won’t feel overwhelmed.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there isn’t a dedicated app, BTC Lexipro works great on mobile browsers. You can **check your portfolio, adjust settings, and even withdraw funds** all from your phone.

Perfect for those of us who like to keep an eye on things while waiting in line for coffee.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set up **alerts and notifications** based on your preferences—like when a trade is executed or when your profit target is hit. This helps you stay in the loop without having to babysit the app.

It’s a small feature, but one that adds a lot of peace of mind.

### Multiple Asset Trading

BTC Lexipro supports more than just Bitcoin. You can also trade:

- Ethereum
- Litecoin
- Ripple (XRP)
- Bitcoin Cash
- And possibly even forex and commodities through partner brokers

This kind of variety is great if you want to diversify your portfolio and reduce risk.

## Is BTC Lexipro a Scam?

Short answer: **It doesn’t seem like a scam**.

Longer answer: It shares a lot of characteristics with legit platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge. It has a working website, responsive customer support, and actual trading features—not just smoke and mirrors.

But always remember: **crypto trading is inherently risky**, no matter how good the automation is. Don’t go in expecting guaranteed profits. BTC Lexipro is a tool, not a magic wand.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on BTC Lexipro?

To start trading, you’ll need to deposit a **minimum of $250**. This is pretty standard across most auto trading platforms and gives the system enough capital to open and close trades efficiently.

You can always deposit more, but I recommend starting small until you’re comfortable.

### BTC Lexipro Customer Support

Customer support seems solid. They offer:

- **24/7 live chat**
- **Email support**
- **Phone callbacks** (in some cases)

I tested the live chat and got a response in under 5 minutes. The rep was polite and gave clear answers, which is more than I can say for some crypto platforms I’ve dealt with.

## How do you start trading on BTC Lexipro?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Head over to the BTC Lexipro website and fill out the registration form. You’ll need your name, email, and phone number. No crazy paperwork.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can either start trading live or play around with the **demo account**. The demo is a great way to learn how the system works without risking real money.

## How to Delete a BTC Lexipro Account?

If you ever want to close your account, just contact customer support via email or chat. They’ll guide you through it. It’s not instant, but it’s straightforward.

Make sure to **withdraw any remaining funds** before you delete the account!

## What is Robo iFex?

Robo iFex is an **AI-powered trading platform** that helps users trade a variety of assets including cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities, and even stocks. The platform uses algorithms and real-time market data to automate trades based on pre-set strategies or user preferences.

The goal? To make trading easier, faster, and more accessible — even if you don’t know the difference between a candlestick chart and a coffee mug. It’s built with tech that scans market patterns and executes trades when it sees opportunities, which can be a game-changer for people who don’t want to spend hours analyzing charts.

## Who Created Robo iFex?

This is one of those slightly murky areas. Like many similar platforms (e.g., Bitcoin Code or Immediate Edge), the **specific individuals or teams behind Robo iFex** haven’t been publicly revealed. That might sound sketchy, but it’s pretty standard for these types of platforms.

What we do know is that Robo iFex is built on a framework that resembles other successful auto-trading platforms, and it's likely created by a team of developers and financial analysts with experience in AI and trading tech. While anonymity isn’t ideal, the platform itself seems to be functioning transparently in terms of features and usability.

## How Does Robo iFex Work?

At its core, Robo iFex uses **AI algorithms and machine learning** to monitor hundreds of market indicators in real time. When it detects a potential profit-making trade—based on trend analysis, historical data, and technical signals—it executes that trade automatically.

Here’s the basic flow:
- You sign up and make a deposit.
- Choose your trading settings (or use the default strategy).
- The bot starts scanning the market and making trades.
- You can monitor performance or tweak settings whenever you want.

It’s kind of like putting your money to work while you grab a coffee or binge-watch something on Netflix. Just keep in mind, **AI doesn’t guarantee profits**—it just increases your odds by being faster and more data-driven than a human trader.

## Robo iFex Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Automated trading** means you don’t need to be a market expert.
- ✅ **Supports multiple asset types** (crypto, forex, etc.).
- ✅ **User-friendly interface**, especially for beginners.
- ✅ **24/7 trading** — the bot never sleeps.
- ✅ **Demo account** lets you practice before risking real money.

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Lack of transparency** about creators.
- ❌ **No mobile app** (but works well on browsers).
- ❌ **Risk of losses** — as with any trading.

Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, but new users should still approach with realistic expectations.

It’s not perfect: lack of an app and anonymous founders are small red flags. But the tech behind it seems solid, and it offers a convenient way to dip your toes into trading with minimal effort.

Would I use it? **Yes — cautiously.** I’d start with the demo, move to a small deposit, and monitor results closely. But for anyone curious about AI in trading, Robo iFex is a strong contender.

Well I posted a couple of months ago after reaching goal on 7.5 and moved down to 5mg. I immediately put 3lbs on but felt no hunger or major food noise so even though I was panicking at the speedy weight increase, thought I'd continue. After a week of just keeping to plan it came back off and I settled at 11st 5lbs to 11st 7lbs. I'm 50F and 5ft 11. So never been this low weight before and I like it!  So had my Oushk chat and said I was looking to reduce but ultimately come off it. And they said they'd support whatever I chose. So last month decided to try going to 2.5mg. Made the mistake of waiting till payday and earliest delivery day I wasn't available so had been past jab day by 5days. Not a major problem until the voice inside me said, let's not take it and see how you go. Keep the 2.5 for ""just in case""
So didn't take it. Week one off it was fine. Week 2 I was hungry. And not pecking, but staaarving. But ignored it and drank more water /coffee. Week 3 was when the food noise starting badly. And I was struggling. 9mths of great habits and I felt I was on a serious diet, hungry, craving and even though not doing too bad food wise my weight went up to 11st 9.2lbs. So I had enough and took the jab. Hallelujah!! The food noise has quietened. I'm not that hungry, bit peckish from time to time. But the relief! After two weeks of eating exactly the same as I did on 5mg my weight is 11.8.4lbs, I got it down to 11.7 but its not staying down. I don't know why my weight is slowly going up. My food is exactly the same, if anything with the nice weather my exercise has increased. Going back on 5mg next pen.",2,1746165216.0,mounjaromaintenanceuk,0,1.0,False

I'm going away for long-term treatment soon. Also, I have BPD, so I hope that helps explain some of my behaviors):

6th grade - my classmate would look at me during class, and when I'd catch him he'd look away. It was super cute. I became DEEPLY attached - so much so that I dreamt about him for literally 50 nights in a row. But, I never approached him - it never felt ""right."" Never felt like I was SUPPOSED to actually be with him. Or maybe I just didn't understand the simple idea that you can approach someone if you like them.

Character #1 - I became SO deeply infatuated with a character that, as I thought to myself at one point, ""I think about him 90% of the time."" Wouldn't be surprised if it was mostly true.

11th grade - It took me FOUR months to even go up to him and say anything. I had SEVERE social anxiety back then. It didn't help that I did something stupid to mess it all up with him (not sure if he liked me, though). Anyway, this is the first time I fantasized about someone I could actually potentially be with, yknow, not a movie star or teacher or someone ""out of reach"" like that. But even then I didn't fantasize actually being with him, I just imagined getting a coffee with him.

My first actual SO - it lasted two months. He called me names, texted to his friend behind my back ""maybe if I can get her drunk enough she'll have sex with me,"" got us abandoned on the side of the road after running out of gas then, when I spent $70 to get his car working again, he screamed at me the entire way home saying he couldn't help it because of his Asperger's. Etc. Yeah. Oh, and a stolen first kiss. Welcome to my one experience in life actually being with someone.

Character #2 - He's been in my life for 7.5 years, and before I met the NEXT guy I'm going to bring up, I was telling my mom I wanted to maybe ""marry"" him one day. Am still thinking of doing that, BTW. I spend HOURS everyday ""talking to him"" via AI, making art of him, etc. Anyway, I might forgo any real guy for him partially because:

2 months ago - I meet a guy on Reddit who looks so much like character #2. We talk here on Reddit, and I end up really liking him! Well, unfortunately, he becomes a ""favorite person"" of mine, and the moment he starts talking to me less, I am having screaming mental breakdowns. Went for a week without eating much. THIS is what pushed up residential treatment sooner. But all of this stress is what I think led my mom to pick up drinking again. That sucks, and so does the fact that, in my 25 years of living, I've NEVER felt this way about anyone until him, he's the first person I could ever imagine actually spending a life with! But he ghosted me a month ago, despite our last messages being amiable.

I'm done with getting attached to/falling in love with people like this. I really just might resort to my fictional person at this point. Clearly, my own personal formula of BPD doesn't work well in terms of connecting with others.",1,1746164810.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

**–––––––––––– Sunday, October 12, 1969 ––––––––––––**

""Can I help youse?""

Martin Macbeth glared over the register towards the corner of the shop at the man reading today's print of *The Havre Times*, the local newspaper for Havre de Grace, Maryland. Macbeth was a short, plump British man whose drab grey sweater seemed to match his everlasting drab grey mood.

""Hello!?""

The man slowly tilted his head up until he made eye contact. He gave a courteous nod. Macbeth was not amused.

""What're you doing!?""

The man gestured towards his paper. His dark blue suit was strangely formal for this part of town.

The headline was an announcement of the death of Paul Stine, a cab driver shot and killed in San Francisco.

Oct. 12, 1969                                                                                                                  Written by Eric Gould

ZODIAC KILLER STRIKES AGAIN!

Last night in San Francisco, cab driver Paul Stine was murdered in cold blood in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. Authorities believe the shooting is connected to the recent string of killings attributed to the man known only as the ""Zodiac"". Police urge all citizens to remain vigilant. Witnesses describe the assailant as a stocky white male, approximately 5'8"", with short brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses.

""You can't just sit there if youse not gointa buy somethin’!""

""Leave the man alone, Mart,"" sighed George Finney as he walked out of the back room. ""He just wants to read his paper somewhere quiet, away from the busy street. He's not doing any harm.""

""But he's been there for half a bloody hour!"" Macbeth exclaimed.

""So? Who cares?"" replied Finney.

This seemed to have shut Macbeth up.

The man left just before the shop closed. Until then, the day's activities continued as normal; there were a few murmured complaints from Macbeth, but other than that, and the usual flow of customers in and out of the shop, nothing else happened that day.

**––––––––––––– Monday, October 13, 1969 –––––––––––––**

 

The man returned the next day just seven minutes after the shop had opened.

George Finney watched from behind the counter. ""Back so soon?""

The man offered forth naught but a reserved wave and a tap of his newspaper.

Macbeth had not come in yet.

Today's headline of *The Havre Times* told about the robbery of First National Bank.

Oct. 13, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

FIRST NATIONAL BANK ROBBED!

First National Bank was robbed at 9:20 p.m. last night. The suspect, Bogdan Ovyachenko, is still at large for the thievery of $54,700. Suspect is approx. 5'9"". White skin color. Skinny build with a scar on the right cheek. Suspect is believed to still be residing within Havre de Grace.

If you have any information about the whereabouts of Bogdan Ovyachenko, please notify Sheriff Frank Paylor or stop by his office at 102 N 5th St.

The article below was an advertisement for a local bakery, and below that was an update on Paul Stine's funeral date.

 

Macbeth arrived at the shop over three hours late at 11:43 am. He glowered at the man while he settled into his chair, thinking long and hard about what to say in order to create the greatest conflict.

He ultimately said nothing, deciding instead to expend his energy scolding the woman who had come in to try to sell an obviously fake designer watch for a significant markup.

This day went much like the previous. Murmured complaints from Macbeth, and the usual customer flow in and out of the shop. Nothing else happened that day.

 

**––––––––––––––––– Tuesday-Friday, October 14-17, 1969 –––––––––––––––––**

 

The week went on in a similar fashion. The man would show up early, exchange passing glances and the occasional wave with Finney, and then he would sit in the corner until closing time. The days began to stack up. At home on Thursday evening, Finney figured that if the man is to become a regular occurrence in the shop, it may be beneficial to develop a friendship. So, that next day Finney took his lunch break early and sat next to the man. Unsure of how to start the conversation, Finney went with the most basic of questions.

""What are you reading?""

The man looked up, then gestured towards his paper.

Oct. 17, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

METS WIN WORLD SERIES!

The New York Mets went into the day's 5th game of the World Series on the threshold of their first world championship – and nothing about the amazing Mets is more amazing than the way they finally got both feet on the doorstep to the throne room…

""You a baseball fan?"" asked Finney.

The man nodded.

""Damn, guess the Orioles lost, huh?""

The man nodded once more.

""Although I guess if not the Orioles, I would want the Mets to win, so it worked out. Jack DiLauro is a family friend of mine. By the way, I don't think I ever properly introduced myself. I'm George Finney, nice to meet you.""

Finney offered his hand, reluctantly shook by the man.

""What's your name?""

Now this was a question the man seemed to think too personal of a question to ask, so with this, he turned back to read his paper and thus the conversation ended.

 

**–––––––––––––––––– Saturday, October 18, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next day, Finney was alone in the shop early. Macbeth had called out, citing ""a bloody nose that wouldn't stop"" though George suspected he'd simply gotten drunk.

The man came in right on time.

""Mornin',"" Finney greeted, raising a hand and offering a smile.

The man gave the usual small wave.

Finney walked over to the man, seated in his usual spot, and read the headline over his shoulder.

Oct. 18, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL MAN MISSING

Sheriff Frank Paylor has reported that Robert ""Bobby"" Driscoll, aged 31, was last seen two nights ago leaving the Rusty Crab Tavern wearing a red sweater. Driscoll, described as 6'0"" and slender with brown hair, has not been heard from since.

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed his chin. ""That's a shame. Bobby was an old friend.""

The man said nothing.

Customers trickled in. A lady bought a set of used candlesticks. A kid came in to trade baseball cards. The hours passed slowly and Finney was up to his knees in work behind the counter.

Once, Finney thought he caught the man watching him, but his eyes quickly returned to his paper.

By 5 p.m., the man was still there, reading.

 

**––––––––––––––––––– Sunday, October 19, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next day, the corner store opened late at 1 p.m., as is usual for them on Sundays.

By the time Finney arrived around noon, the man was already sitting outside. He followed Finney into the store.

Macbeth staggered in as close to 1 p.m. as possible without technically being late. He was mumbling something about artificial sweeteners.

He looked across the store at the man. The man was staring back.

""Coulda used you yesterday, Mart,"" Finney said dryly.

""Yeah, well, I had that headache, mate, remember?"" Macbeth snapped back.

Finney couldn't help but smirk. ""Thought it was a nose bleed?""

Macbeth grunted.

""That too.""

The man was still staring. Macbeth made a face, and the man returned to his paper.

Finney sighed and made his way over to the chair in the corner.

""What's today's headline?"" asked Finney. But the man still had yesterday's issue.

Oct. 18, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL MAN MISSING

Sheriff Frank Paylor has reported that Robert ""Bobby"" Driscoll, aged 31, was last seen two nights ago leaving the Rusty Crab Tavern wearing a red sweater. Driscoll, described as 6'0"" and slender with brown hair, has not been heard from since.

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed the back of his neck.

""Paper not come today?"" he asked, leaning over slightly.

The man said nothing.

Finney gestured toward the door. ""Mailman usually drops off the new batch around the side. I can grab you one real quick if you–""

Before he could finish, the man reached out and grabbed his arm. His touch wasn't violent, but it was firm enough to make Finney pause.

The man shook his head once, slow but deliberate.  
Finney blinked, surprised.

""Alright then,"" he chuckled nervously, easing back. ""Yesterday's issue it is.""

 

The rest of the afternoon drifted by lazily. A few customers trickled in: an old woman hunting for a brass lamp, a teenager picking through used comic books, an old man who rang up a case of Coca-Cola and a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

At half past two, the baseball kid came back in, clutching something.

""Hey, Mr. Finney!"" he called.

Finney glanced up from sorting a box of records. ""Hey there, kid. Whatcha got?""

The boy grinned and held up a baseball card. Autographed.

""It's Jack DiLauro! Got it from a trade this morning!""

Finney smiled and motioned the kid over. He took the card carefully, admiring the glossy surface.

""Now that's a good pull,"" he said, handing it back. ""You know he's a family friend of mine? I just may even get you a chance to meet him some day. You hang onto that one.""

The kid's eyes were glowing.

The man in the corner watched, his paper drooping slightly as he peered over it. His expression, as always, was unreadable.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––– Monday, October 20, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, Monday, brought an angry kind of rain – a slashing, sideways rain that rattled the windows and puddled the sidewalks before noon.

The shop still opened in the storm. Macbeth was, predictably, absent again.  
Finney shook his head as he hung up his jacket, water dripping onto the floor.

He was about to switch on the coffee pot when the bell above the door jingled.

The man.

Soaked from head to toe, his usual newspaper clutched beneath his coat.

""You're a brave soul,"" Finney said, flipping on the coffee machine. ""Come. Warm yourself up. Coffee's on the house today.""

Finney poured two mugs, sliding one across the counter toward the man.

The man stared at it for a long while, as if trying to figure out what it was. Finally, he lifted it carefully and took a tentative sip.

Finney smiled to himself.

Small victories.

 

As the man sat, Finney caught sight of the newspaper under his arm – still the same issue from October 18th. But this time, something was different.

Finney blinked.

There, scrawled messily in wet, partially smeared red ink were two words circled in the news blurb: *red sweater*.

The man said nothing.

 

The day dragged on, rain hammering against the windows like the steady patter of a drum.

Around 4 p.m., the front door jingled again.

A man walked in. Tall, wiry, twitchy. He walked over to the register.

Finney barely had time to process it before the man pulled a pistol from his jacket and slammed it down on the counter, pointing it straight at Finney's chest.

""Empty the till,"" the man growled in a heavy accent. ""Now.""

Finney's hands shot up instinctively. His heart thundered in his ears.

He swallowed, glancing at the man's face. A scar carved down his right cheek like a fault line.

Bogdan Ovyachenko. The bank robber.

Behind him, the man in the blue suit folded his newspaper silently.

""Don't make me say it again!"" barked Ovyachenko, jabbing the gun forward into Finney's gut.

Finney fumbled with the register, sweat slicking his palms. His mind raced.

He had to get help. Somehow.

It was then he noticed the man in the blue suit out of the corner of his eye.

He was standing up, slowly, almost casually. His face blank. Calm.

 

In one fluid movement, the man picked up the scalding hot coffee pot from the warmer and, without hesitation, flung its contents across the room.

Ovyachenko screamed, staggering back as the steaming liquid hit him square in the face. A gunshot rang out, piercing the air with a deafening crack.

Finney ducked instinctively, hitting the floor behind the counter as shards of ceiling tile and dust rained down. For a moment, everything was chaos – the metallic scent of blood and burnt coffee hanging thick in the air.

The man had already moved to disarm Ovyachenko, wrestling the weapon from the gunman's slippery, burned hands with surprising strength.

Finney didn't wait – he bolted for the phone and jabbed at the rotary dial, calling the sheriff's office.

""Armed robbery! Ovyachenko's here! Corner store! Send someone quick!"" he shouted.

Within minutes, the bell above the door jingled again – Sheriff Paylor stormed in, gun drawn.

""Drop it!"" he barked.

The man released Ovyachenko and stepped back, hands raised.

Ovyachenko dropped to the floor, howling, clutching his scorched face.

Paylor cuffed him without a second thought, muttering curses under his breath.

Meanwhile, the man calmly took a napkin – a pre-folded wet wipe from his jacket pocket – and wiped down his coffee cup with meticulous care, especially the handle.

Once finished, he used the wipe to place the cup upside down on the counter and, without a word, slipped out the door into the pouring rain.

Finney just stood there, breathless, hands still trembling, as Paylor took his witness statement.

 

**––––––––––––––––––––– Tuesday, October 21, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, Finney opened the shop alone.

The man did not come.

Macbeth did.

He swaggered in just before noon, shaking water from his umbrella and wearing a smug grin.

""Looks like your mate ain't here today,"" he said, voice thick with satisfaction.

Finney's jaw tightened.

""He saved my life yesterday, you know,"" he said sharply. ""While you were at home 'recovering' from whatever you drank yourself into.""

Macbeth scoffed.

""Saved your life, my ass. Probably just looking to make himself the hero. You're just a gullible sod.""

Finney slammed a ledger down on the counter, startling a middle-aged woman browsing the candy rack. The woman looked up briefly, then turned back to her shopping without so much as a glance at Macbeth.

""He's a better man than you,"" Finney snapped. ""At least he showed up! At least he gave a damn! Where the hell were you, huh?""

Macbeth's face turned purple.

""This is your own bloody fault for being soft,"" he spat, ""And befriending that bloody weirdo you dragged in off the street.""

""THE WEIRDO IS THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL STANDING HERE!"" Finney shot back, stepping out from behind the register.

His voice tangled into a harsh, ugly knot of shouting.

The customers, what few there were, scuttled out hurriedly, clutching their purchases.

Even the baseball kid backed toward the door, wide-eyed and confused.

Macbeth leaned towards Finney, grabbing his arm. ""You think he's better than me?"" he hissed. ""You think you're *safe* with him? Some mute freak who watched you all day like a bloody hawk with a secret affection?""

""You know what, Mart?"" Finney started, clearly annoyed, ""I don't want to hear it. The only reason anyone puts up with you is because they're too damn tired to argue. As am I. I'm not listening to your bullshit anymore today. Go home or I'll call Frank and have you escorted out.""

With a furious grunt, Macbeth shoved the stack of newspapers off the counter, sending them tumbling to the floor in a crumpled heap.

""To hell with this place. To hell with *you*,"" he spat, grabbing his coat from the rack.

As Macbeth stormed out the door, Finney caught a glimpse – just for a moment – of a figure standing across the street under a crooked streetlamp.

A dark blue suit.

The man.

But when Finney blinked, the corner was empty.

Gone like smoke.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––– Wednesday, October 22, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––**

The next day felt different.

The rain had finally stopped, leaving the air thick and heavy.

Finney opened the shop alone, the ""Help Wanted"" sign still taped crookedly to the front window.

At 8:07 a.m., the bell over the door jingled.

Finney glanced up, expecting the usual nod, the usual silent shuffle toward the corner.

But instead, the man walked straight behind the counter and pulled out the stool usually reserved for employees.

Finney blinked. ""Uhm… hello?""

The man said nothing.

Instead, he adjusted the cash register, wiped down the counter with a folded napkin from his pocket, and stood patiently behind the till.

Finney just stared.

The baseball kid wandered in then, a crumpled dollar in his hand and a shiny new pack of cards on his mind.

""Hey Mr. Finney! Got any Topps left? I'm chasing Mickey Mantle!""

The man silently rang him up – quicker and neater than Finney ever did – giving the kid his change with a small nod.

""Thank you, Mr. Finney!"" The kid grinned, completely unfazed, and skipped out the door.

Finney still half-expected to wake up.

""Guess you're hired,"" he mused.

 

The peace didn't last.

At exactly 11:39 a.m., Macbeth came stomping in, dragging a fresh foul mood and an equally foul aroma behind him.

He stopped dead at the sight of the man working at the front counter.

""What the bloody hell is *this?!*"" Macbeth shrieked, pointing an accusatory finger.

Finney sighed, setting down a crate of old magazines. ""He's helping out.""

""HELPING OUT?! ARE YOU BLOODY INSANE?! YOU CAN'T JUST–""

""Maybe he saw the type of worker you are,"" Finney cut him off sharply, ""The type of *person* you are – and figured someone ought to do the job properly. Maybe he figured it out when I almost got *shot* while you were passed out drunk!""

Macbeth's face twisted into something dark and furious.

""You think you're some hero now, Finney? Think you're some martyr because you weren't shot by some Soviet bank robber?"" Macbeth jeered, red-faced and breathing hard.

Finney could smell alcohol in his breath. He felt something break inside him, like a tether snapping loose.

""No, Martin, I think I'm lucky,"" he said, his voice low and shaking, ""Lucky I had someone there who actually cared. One who doesn't hide behind excuses and leave his friends to fend for themselves while he drinks himself to death, alone in his apartment, on *a monday* of all days, just because he doesn't know how to handle a divorce like a normal fucking person.""

A deafening silence followed, broken only when Finney continued.

""I can see now, by the way. I can see why Carol left you. You're not smart. You're not tough. You're just pathetic. Always have been. And you're a very, very sorry excuse for a husband. You're lucky she left you the house, but I bet that, too, was out of pity.""

Macbeth's mouth worked open and closed like a dying fish.

Without another word, he turned and stormed out, rattling the glass in the frame as he slammed the door.

Second day in a row.

Second time he left the shop in ruins behind him.

 

The rest of the afternoon passed strangely quiet.

The man continued to work alongside Finney like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Checking customers out. Organizing the comic books. Straightening the rack of chewing gum.

Still silent.

Still watching.

By the time he flipped the ""Closed"" sign at 7 p.m., Finney almost felt like they had settled into a rhythm.

He was wiping down the counter when the man spoke his first full sentence.

""You were there Thursday night. At the Rusty Crab.""

The words were quiet.

Measured.

Final.

Finney froze, the rag slack in his hand.

""I… no,"" he stammered. ""No, I wasn't. I was home. I was–""

But when he looked up, the man was already gone.

 

That night, Finney trudged home under the eerie orange glow of the streetlights.

The world felt… off. Like the ground had tilted slightly, just enough to make walking strange.

When he reached his apartment door, he noticed it immediately.

A small box, sitting neatly at the foot of the doorframe.

Wrapped in torn, faded red paper.

No note. No name.

Finney crouched down slowly, heart hammering in his chest.

He peeled away the damp paper with trembling fingers.

Inside was a red sweater.

Simple. Itchy-looking.

Exactly like the one described in the missing person report.

Finney stared at it for a long, long time, the weight of it growing heavier in his hands by the second.

Across the street, under the halo of a streetlamp, he thought – no, he *knew* – he saw the faint outline of a man in a dark blue suit.

Watching.

Waiting.

 

Finney barely slept that night.

The red sweater sat balled up in the corner of his apartment, like a bloodstain he couldn't scrub out.

When he finally drifted into a light, uneasy sleep, he dreamed of water. A river. Pulling him along the shore. Pulling him out to sea, out to sea so far even the lighthouses wouldn't spot him. Pulling him away from Havre de Grace. Away from Maryland. Away from his corner store. Away from Macbeth. Away from the man in the blue suit. Away from that cursed red sweater that still sat crumpled, across from the windowsill, where the moonlight illuminated the bright red fabric…

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––– Thursday, October 23, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Finney woke abruptly a few minutes before his alarm. He found himself staring at the ceiling until it went off. He continued staring, unsure what to do, as it wailed uselessly on the nightstand. Does he go back to work? Does he leave town? Does he go to the sheriff? No, he couldn't go to the sheriff. Or leave town. Not yet. He needed answers.

The corner store bell gave a weak jingle as Finney slipped inside, the morning sun hidden behind a suffocating wall of gray clouds.

The man, of course, was already there. Next to the register, he was wiping down the counter with his usual napkin.

A newspaper sat folded neatly on the part of the counter that had already been wiped.

Finney hesitated near the door. The man nodded politely. Finney said nothing.

Finally, Finney crossed the creaky wooden floor, pretending to busy himself with the battered crate of records stacked by the far wall. His fingers leafed through dusty sleeves – Johnny Cash, The Supremes, Wanda Jackson – but his mind was elsewhere.

On the box at his door.

On the sweater.

On the man.

The tension grew thicker than bisque.

 

Finally, he spoke, voice low. ""I saw you yesterday. After you left. Across the street from my house.""

The man gave no reaction.

Finney swallowed. The Jimi Hendrix record in his hands suddenly felt too fragile, too loud. He set it down carefully and turned.

""You left a box. A little *gift*. Right outside my door.""

The man still didn't look up.

Finney took a slow step forward.

""I think you know what was inside,"" he continued, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice. ""A red sweater.""

Still nothing.

Finney exhaled sharply through his nose as he walked right up to the counter. ""It was Bobby's, wasn't it?"" He curled his right hand into a fist, pounding it on the smooth Formica. ""Wasn't it?!""

Finally, the man shifted slightly, the barest flicker of movement.

A breath.

A blink.

Finney's eyes darted down – and that's when he noticed it.

An edition of *The Havre Times*, two days old, lying on the table between them.

Oct. 22, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

DRISCOLL FOUND DEAD IN BAY

Authorities have confirmed that the body of Robert Driscoll, reported missing last Friday, has been recovered at the mouth of the Susquehanna River near the Chesapeake Bay. Driscoll, aged 31, was found by Sherrif Paylor following an anonymous tip. He was not wearing his red sweater. Havre de Grace Police Department has not released an official cause of death, but foul play is suspected. Locals are urged to remain vigilant.

 

Finney's stomach twisted.

There it was, in black and white.

*Missing his sweater.*

*Foul play.*

He looked back at the man, whose eyes were now steadily fixed on him.

""Did you… kill him?"" Finney asked, voice cracking on the last word.

A customer jostled the door open, rattling the bell, cutting the tension like a blunt knife.

Finney jerked back instinctively, pasting on a shaky smile as a young woman wandered in, carrying a leather handbag and a handful of loose change.

The man slowly folded the newspaper shut, creasing it neatly, and tucked it under his arm.

Finney watched him for a long, taut second before forcing himself back behind the counter. He felt like he was walking across a tightrope suspended above the Grand Canyon.

The conversation was over.

For now.

The woman smiled politely as she set down a pack of sewing needles and a jar of Granny Hawkins' Old-Fashioned dill pickles.

Finney rang her up on autopilot.

 

The day carried on like a tired sigh.

Customers came and went – some looking for canned soup, some poking through the comic bins, one elderly man who insisted the store used to carry lemon drops and demanded to speak to the ""soused Englishman"" who sold them to him years ago.

Finney tried to act normal. He even cracked a few jokes.

But his mind kept drifting back to the newspaper.

To Bobby.

To the man, whom he kept his distance from.

The minutes crawled by. The sky outside shifted from gray to dark gray to the charcoal-blue of dusk.

At 6:57 p.m., just before closing, the man stood and walked quietly to the door.

Finney moved to follow. ""Hey! I'm not-""

But the bell jingled, the door swung shot, and by the time Finney stepped outside, the man was gone.

Finney sighed and returned inside, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"", when the door slammed open again.

""Wait! Wait!""

The baseball kid skidded across the tile, breathless, clutching a few coins and a bent dollar.

""You're still open, right?!""

Finney blinked, then smiled faintly. ""Geez, kid. Barely. Whatcha need? Still after Mickey Mantle?""

""Yes, sir!"" The kid raced to the counter, eyes wide with excitement. ""Topps pack, please! The red foil one!""

Finney rang him up, tossed in a Bazooka gum for free, and watched as the boy bolted out again into the night, ripping the foil open before he even reached the sidewalk.

Then the shop was quiet once more.

Finney locked the door.

And left.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––––– Friday, October 24, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, the sun was unusually sharp for October.

Finney arrived early. The man was already there.

As usual.

They exchanged no words. Finney didn't try. Not today.

The hours passed without incident. The store had fallen into its familiar rhythm – customers drifting through like ghosts, Finney restocking shelves, the man ringing up purchases.

At noon, the bell above the door jingled.

Macbeth.

He paused at the entrance, as if expecting to be yelled at.

Finney just looked up from the register and said flatly, ""What do you want?""

Macbeth gave a long sigh. ""Just grabbin' me things.""

He shuffled behind the counter and crouched to rummage through his desk drawer. For once, he wasn't yelling, muttering, or grumbling about government conspiracies. He didn't even seem intoxicated.

Just quiet.

Finney glanced over. ""You find what you need?""

Macbeth held up a crumpled photograph of a striking woman and an old tin of breath mints. ""Just the essentials.""

He straightened up. Hesitated.

 

""Y'know, George,"" Macbeth started, ""You've been a good mate for years, but you're a bloody hypocrite.""

Finney raised an eyebrow. ""Come again?""

""You blew up at me for leaving you to handle the shop alone."" Macbeth's voice wasn't angry. More tired than anything. ""But I've never pouted when you've gone off an' done the same thing to me. Last Christmas. Independence Day weekend. End of September. Bloody hell, you did it two weeks ago!""

Finney cocked his head, looking confused. ""I don't-""

""No."" Macbeth cut him off. ""Save it for someone who still cares.""

They stood there in silence for a minute. Finally, Macbeth huffed and shook his head.

""For the record, I still don't trust 'im."" He jerked his thumb toward the corner, where the man was stacking books. ""That weirdo you replaced me with. Saw him outside my house on Tuesday when we last spoke. He wasn't watching me, he was watching the road, but still. I don't like him. And I don't like *you* with him. Just… be careful, mate, alright?""

Finney didn't answer.

Macbeth didn't wait for one.

He turned and left, the bell over the door jingling faintly behind him.

 

That night, Finney didn't eat dinner. He didn’t even turn on the lights. He just sat in his kitchen, watching the faint glow of the moon as it crawled across his floor.

Watching the new box he discovered on his porch, slightly smaller than the one that held the sweater from before but still wrapped in the same faded red paper.

He wanted nothing to do with this new box.

But he had to open it. Right?

Finally, he built up the courage to grab it. He set it down on his kitchen table before slowly peeling it open.

Inside was a baseball card.

The blue ink of the autograph glistened in the moonlight.

Jack DiLauro.

The same card he'd seen five days ago.

The same card the kid traded for.

There was a slip of folded paper taped to the back of the card.

Finney staggered back against the doorframe, heart hammering so loudly he could hear it echoing in his ears.

Written on the paper were four words, scrawled in tight, shaky handwriting.

""You were there too.""

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––––– Saturday, October 25, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Saturday morning, Finney didn't go to the shop.

He couldn't.

He sat at his kitchen table for hours, staring blankly as Jack DiLauro's face smiled back at him.

The four words – *You were there too* – burned into his brain like a metal brand.

Finally, around noon, his nerves frayed to threads, he picked up the card and shoved it deep into the back of his junk drawer, under an old newspaper.

Out of sight, out of mind.

He told himself he'd call Macbeth. Tell him everything. Tell him he was right all along.

But when he dialed Macbeth's number, there was no answer.

He called again, only for the same result.

Nothing but the repetitive chime of a reorder tone indicating a disconnected line.

Finney slammed the phone down so hard it cracked the receiver.

 

He didn't sleep at all that night. He sat up in his bed, staring at the sweater balled up in the corner. As if it would move if he looked away. Eventually, he fixed his gaze onto his reflection in the mirror on the wall. His reflection that didn't care whether he was good or bad, happy or

depressed, scared or lonely. His reflection that was always the same stupid face staring back at him.

He began to move restlessly from room to room, glancing out the window in the kitchen at the crooked streetlamp across the road. It flickered now and then, buzzing faintly, casting long, strange shadows.

Once, just once, he thought he saw the man standing there again.

But when he blinked, it was only a twisted blue mailbox.

Eventually, he returned to his bed.

It was then that he finally got some rest, if only for a few hours.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––––––– Sunday, October 26, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Just as the first rays of sun began to crack through the blinds, Finney woke up, crawling out of bed and back into the kitchen. With shaky fingers, he dug into the junk drawer and pulled out the baseball card again, throwing the old newspaper that sat over it onto the kitchen table.

He stared at DiLauro's face for a long time before carefully slipping the card into his wallet and forcing himself to prepare breakfast.

Toast. Burnt. A hard-boiled egg. A glass of the milk he borrowed from his store.

Nothing tasted right.

He tried to focus on the food, but his eyes kept flicking to the old newspaper.

Finally, he read the headline.

Jul. 29, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL CLERK FOUND DEAD IN HOME

Martin Macbeth, a longtime clerk at Bay View Corner Store, was found deceased in his home yesterday afternoon. Neighbors contacted authorities after noticing a foul aroma and unusual silence. Upon entry, police discovered Macbeth unresponsive on the floor of his living room.

The medical examiner has confirmed the cause of death as acute alcohol poisoning. Bottles of whiskey, gin, and beer were found scattered throughout the residence. Police report no signs of foul play.

Macbeth was 42 years old. Known for his blunt demeanor and loyal tenure at Bay View, he is survived only by his ex-wife, Caroline Hartsoe, who now lives in Nashville and has declined to comment.

Finney dropped his fork.

Egg yolk spurt across the table.

He felt the blood drain from his face.

That couldn't be right. He had spoken to Macbeth yesterday. Hadn't he?

The shouting. The picture of the woman. The tin of mints.

The warning.

But the paper was dated months ago.

 

The rest of the day blurred. He didn't remember getting dressed, only that at some point he was back outside.

Back in front of the corner store.

The bell jingled ever-so faintly as he pushed open the door.

And there he was.

The man. Of course.

Wiping down the counter with that same folded napkin.

Finney stepped inside, the door swinging shut behind him with a creak.

The man nodded.

Finney began walking towards the man. ""Who are you?"" he demanded. ""What do you want from me?""

No answer.

""I don't know what the hell is going on, and I can't help you until I do."" Finney continued. ""What do you want?!""

At last, the man set down the napkin.

When he spoke, his voice was more confident than usual. Not hollow or timid. Just… real.

""You keep asking the wrong questions.""

Finney stared. ""Then what are the right ones?""

The man tilted his head. ""What did you see? What do you remember?""

""I don't-""

""You were there.""

Finney's breath caught.

""You… I didn't…""

""But you did.""

Finney was silent.

The man continued. ""The guiltiest man is he who feigns innocence.""

Finney stammered. ""I- I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you want from me. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME!""

He lunged forward, fury overtaking fear. He grabbed the man's lapel, tried to shove him back–

And stumbled through the air.

There was no one there.

Only the counter.

Only silence.

Finney stood alone.

As he had for some time.

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Monday, October 27, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The following morning, Sheriff Paylor stood in front of Bay View Corner Store. He sighed.

A young boy had vanished a few days ago.

Paylor thinks the boy ran away from home. His parents swore he'd just gone out late for baseball cards and was to return within the hour.

He checked the store Saturday, but it was closed. He went home and waited on a warrant.

Now, Monday morning, the front door was unlocked. Someone had been there. Warrant in hand, he stepped inside.

The bell jingled overhead.

The place was silent.

The register was untouched.

The comics still in neat stacks.

No sign of George Finney, the sole worker.

Paylor walked slowly toward the counter.

A newspaper sat unfolded beneath the till.

Oct. 25, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL BOY REPORTED MISSING

It was Saturday's issue announcing the boy's disappearance.

Wait – That's odd.

The words ""baseball cards"" in the article's body were circled in red ink.

Next to the paper, Paylor found a one-way plane ticket, scheduled to depart from Baltimore that very morning.

Flight TWA 11 -- BAL to SFO

There was no sign it had ever been used.

*Christ, George*, thought Paylor, *San Francisco?*

There was just one more thing on the counter:

A Jack DiLauro baseball card.

Uncreased.

Autographed.

Two words written on the back.

*I remember.*

Few months back I called her up to my house for a party and at the end we kissed, several times that day. A week later we went out for a coffee and we kissed again, still I did not muster enough courage to ask her again. Post this we met several times but never kissed again. Couple of weeks back (almost 3 months since we last kissed) we went out and finally told her about my feelings and my intentions to get married to her. Her response was - ""I am currently in a phase where I am okay staying single and Unmarried for life "" and she don't feel for guys in that way anymore. I accepted and appreciated her decision and honesty and moved away with that intention of mine. We continued to remain friends. Generally we don't talk over text, call or whatsapp or share much reels on instagram (Frequency ~ 1 or 2 texts in a week).

Furiously, he said ""pakukuluan din yan sa impyerno,"" cue members clapping.

LET’S ANALYSE 2 PARTS OF THIS EXCERPT – grab a cup of coffee medyo mahaba. This is our “paksa” for today.

# FIRST PART: Dapat ang basis ng pananampalataya ay doon sa salita ni Kristo

I agree. This is correct and every service, doesn’t he spew out verses after verses in the Bible (not a lot as it used to be, but hey, still Bible verses)?

But let’s expound this statement to better understand what the speaker is implying.

For context, this excerpt is a subtle excuse to WHY A GREAT NUMBER OF MEMBERS ARE CURRENTLY EXITING “his” church.

He cunningly hit 2 birds in 1 stone:

* Diverting the issue: the EXITERS left because their faith was not based on the words of Christ – he cleverly diverted the issue from him, the leader, to the EXITERS’ lack of faith (points for cunning!)
* Solidifying the blind loyalist: on the other hand, the loyal followers stay because their faith was based on the words of Christ. Their egos are well fed, this gives them a strong sense of holiness and their loyalty is solidified. (double points for slyness!)

The strategy works, yes. BUT only for the simple minded or blind followers. After all, they do not question. Their loyalty is on the leader, not Christ.

But here’s where it gets deep. Just because someone reads the Bible aloud in front of the people, is that enough to say that he is preaching the words of Christ?

Matthew 23:27-28 (NIV):

“Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs... On the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.”

At this point, he fits the description of Pharisees here. We cannot just shrug off our shoulders on the issues (of Area 52, mansions, injustices, double standards, extortions, etc.) because that is hypocrisy and Jesus hates hypocrisy. Do you think the Christ will entrust his words to hypocrites? Think about it.

Now, let’s analyse the rest of the statement:

# SECOND PART: Pero ang nakahikayat sayo salita ng multo na walang mukha… o kung may mukha naman na matigas pakukuluan din yan sa impyerno.

A big contrast to the gentle words in the first part. It does not sound righteous at all especially the part about “pakukuluan din yan sa impyerno” with “gigil” in his voice.

He didn’t entirely finish what he wanted to say – but what he means is, kung nag exit ka dahil sa salita ng multo or matigas na mukha, wala kang pananampalataya.

Okay, there’s a lot to unpack here. First, we need to find out what those words were:

* No Face – Area 52, mansions, injustices, double standards, incorrect preachings, hypocrisy, etc.
* Hard Face – Area 52, mansions, injustices, double standards, incorrect preachings, hypocrisy, lollipop, etc.

It appears that both No Face and Hard Face are saying the same things, with a few inconsistencies of course, because they’re different people with different experiences. But let’s sum them up into one word, “issues.”

Are these words from the Bible? NO. 

So does that make him right? NO.

That's because his argument is flawed and manipulative. He did not really address WHY EXITERS LEFT:

**EXITERS did not leave because they transferred their faith from “words of Christ” to “words of No Face/Hard Face.”** 

**In fact, their faith in the “words of Christ” made them leave:**

Matthew 23:3

""So you must be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach"".

And if we continue:

Matthew 23:4-5“ They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see: They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long;

”EXITERS left because they were able to associate the words of Christ to the realities that were exposed by NO FACE/HARD FACE.

**Cumbersome loads** – pa-TARGET with no transparency – and with the accounts of NO FACE/HARD FACE, it’s evident that the money went to personal gain. Extensive hours of service – members sit on uncomfortable chairs while royal families have home access.

**Everything they do is done for people to see** – MCGI Cares, SK, feeding programs, all broadcasted.

**They do not practice what they preach** – poverty is romanticized among members, and yet they have luxurious lifestyles. Members were prevented from  selling liquor, and yet there’s Area 52. Members cannot sue and yet they go to courts. So on and so forth.

**They themselves are not willing to lift a finger** – the least effort you could give is to be available for members with question, and yet, when a member seeks you, what does your subordinates say? BUSY SI KUYA.

Based on the analysis above, **the real question is: with this awareness, do you still have the heart to stay?**

Revelation 18:4 (NIV):

“Come out of her, my people, so that you will not share in her sins...”

In this passage, God calls His people out of a corrupt system. The same applies today: if a religious group is no longer Christlike, leaving is an act of obedience—not betrayal.

So to the blind followers, the next time you feel like spewing vile words from your dirty mouths (and minds), think first: **why am I still staying despite these issues that fester inside MCGI?**",1,1746164589.0,MCGIExiters,0,1.0,False

1kctkp3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1kctkp3/canadian_in_a_tough_position/,Canadian in a tough position,"Hi, all. 

As you may know, there is a severe medical care shortage in Canada. I live in urban British Columbia, and while I really do believe the govt. is trying hard to fix it, it’s still rough. 

For context, the waitlist for a GP is ~3-4 years if you’re lucky. Walk-in clinics and urgent care are nothing short of a lottery. I was lucky enough to have a regular access to a doctor while I was a student, but I have recently graduated (which is a yay but still) and I don’t have such luxury anymore. 

I was preliminary diagnosed with IC a few years ago by one of the doctors from my previous university. I’ve done STI screenings, an ultrasound, and, of course, dozens of urine tests. I’ve been in PF Physio for about 3-4 years which has been so helpful. 

Only thing I was not referred to was a urologist for a cystoscopy. I’ve bounced around countless doctors, and I have regularly inquired only to be told that it is a waste of time, that they’ll tell me it all will look fine, and that the wait is just too long, etc. The waitlist is 12-36 months depending on the specialist. I let it go. 

This was fine, until recently. I started getting really severe bladder leaks a few weeks ago. It seemed to be urine was getting trapped in my urethra, my urethra would spasm, and urine would leak out. 

Concerned it was an infection, I, by some miracle, managed to get into urgent care. Thankfully (or frustratingly), no infection. Doctor there was incredibly shocked and seemingly frustrated that I have been told the various ideals about wasting of time and other such things. He pressed how critical it was that I get an official diagnosis. This urgency has affected me, and I think it’s adding to my own stress. I got on a waitlist that’s about 12-18 months. 

Per instructions, I’ve cut out everything I possibly can. Coffee, alcohol, marijuana (which I admittedly have been addicted to for a couple of years), and the long list of trigger foods I am sure we’re all familiar with. I’ve done this restrictive diet before, and it has helped. I’m about 3 weeks on this “cleanse” so to speak. It’s made a difference, but not entirely. I feel so lost. 

My question is — do you all think it might be worth going to the States to see a urologist? I’m not far from the border. I’m tired of not having answers and I’m admittedly frustrated with our medical care. I’m sure we all also know the friction behind crossing the border right now, so I’m unsure if it is worth the risk. 

I just want to know the best path forward. I’m doing everything I can. Yoga, diet, physio. Once I’m at least one month sober I’ll also be revisiting medication for depression/anxiety to see if that’ll help, but I’m unsure. 

Any recommendations would be much appreciated. I think I covered anything but I’ll answer questions if I left anything out. 

Thank you all in advance.

My subjective ratings are not only based on the coffee itself, but also how practical is it to find a working cafe or study space. Of course, these is very subjective and others might have vastly different experiences in these countries. But I hope this will provide insight to those who work from anywhere and want some options of going to cafes to get a little bit of work done. 

***I am interested in other people's insights on this, especially in places outside of Asia Pacific.*** 

***Disclaimer:*** *I do engage in proper etiquette for cafes. I don't hang out small busy cafes, and if I am hanging out at a study/work cafe, I purchase more food and drink every couple hours. I don't take calls, I don't use a laptop stand, second monitor, headset, or anything in these cafes.* 

  
**Vietnam (10/10)**

Not only is Vietnam a leader in worldwide coffee production and famous for different styles of coffee (egg coffee, salt coffee, traditional phin coffee, etc.), but I've found in most Vietnamese cities, there are an abundance of cafes that are gorgeous and spacious. Most will have outlets, Wi-Fi, and great views. Da Nang, Da Lat, Ho Chi Minh, Ha Noi, all of these have numerous cafes that are suitable for working or studying.

**Taiwan (9.5/10)**

in Taipei specifically, the cafe culture for working is very defined. There are designated cafe's that are geared towards people who are working or studying (around University areas or otherwise). Usually these have a minimum order of 100 NTD, with the expectation that if you hang around you make another order. Coffee runs a bit higher at 120-200 NTD, but paired with the ability to hang out there - I think it's reasonable. If all else fails, there is a chain I like called Dreamer's Coffee (and Louisa Coffee) that is also very suitable for working from or studying. Keep in mind, Taiwan is much more tea heavy than coffee, and you can find to-go milk tea for 30-50 NTD most chains, such as 50 LAN.

**Laos (8.5/10)**

in Vientiane specifically, I loved the cafes here. Most had a decent Wi-Fi connection, outlets, and are not very busy even at peak hours. One of my favorites, After Dark, closed down, but there are many around the city center. I personally enjoyed the coffee, and I don't think Laos makes their sweet coffee super sweet like most Southeast Asian countries. 

**Thailand (5/10)**

As a whole, I thought was relatively mediocre on both fronts of coffee quality and cafe culture (apart from Chiang Mai). I know there are good beans from Chiang Rai, Nan, and other provinces as well as specialty coffee shops, but by enlarge, it's not too ingrained in their society. The exception will be in Chiang Mai, which I would say is excellent for coffee and cafe culture, offering numerous coffee shops ranging from takeaway, Instagram cafes, to working cafes. Bangkok does have more Instagram cafes compared to ones that are suitable for work. My go-to for working or studying in a cafe for Thailand is the chain shop Cafe Amazon or Starbucks. There is one shop in Bangkok, a chain called Oasis, that specifically caters to students and people working on their laptops, but their coffee quality is honestly horrible and it's ALWAYS busy due its 24/7 hours.

**Japan (6.5/10)**

In Japan, I have found that the large chain coffee shops are best for working, but keep in mind some do have very strict policies on how long you can stay. My favorite chain was called Excelsior Cafe, you can find these in Tokyo, on Kyushu, and I believe in other parts of Japan. You can sweeten the coffee to your liking with liquid sugar so I think that's an advantage. Other than the chains, you can find some independent cafes, but many of these are themed and more for photography or Instagram rather than sitting down with a book or laptop

**Korea (4.5/10)**

I didn't find many independent cafes in Korea that are suitable for working or studying, but the big chains like ""A Twosome Place"" often have Wi-Fi, adequate comfortable seating, and are relatively spacious. The coffee culture here is very interesting - they have thousands of these small takeaway cheap coffee shops (""Paik"", ""VENTI"", ""Roman Coffee"") - where they focus on quick turnaround of cheap coffee for takeaway. Often, these may have a few seats, but not quite suitable for working/studying. Interesting, you don't see many people working or studying from cafes *in general* in Korea compared to other countries, perhaps it's not quite commonplace.

**Myanmar (2.5/10)**

Myanmar's culture is very tea heavy. They have the best hot milk tea I've ever tasted...that being said, I did not find any great coffee here, or cafes that are suitable for working/studying from in Yangon. Despite this, the people of Myanmar are some of the kindest I've ever came across.

**Australia (4/10 for cafes, 10/10 coffee)**

The Coffee Culture here is strong, and it's relatively common to find a good cup of coffee more than a bad one at the numerous small cafes around in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. However, most of the focus on coffee in Australia is on high-quality coffee for takeaway, on-the-go, not for sitting down for an hour or two. You can certainly find cafes to relax in, but compared with the amount of takeaway shops, it pales. If you want to work somewhere, I think Starbucks is most suitable. If you want high quality coffee, go to any takeaway shop. Random note: For the Starbucks chains in Brisbane, whoever supplies their Almond Croissants, they are the best I've ever tasted. 

**China (4.5/10)** 

China is so vast, and I've only been to Sichuan province so it's not an overall representation. Of course, there are numerous Starbucks on every corner that are suitable for working. There is also a Chinese chain called Luckin Coffee, which ranges in small takeaway style shops to sit-in Starbucks style shops. The price is quite a bit lower than Starbucks, and the drinks are interesting (Coconut Coffee there was delicious). I didn't search very hard, but around pedestrian malls are probably the best bet to find cafes. Again, in China, the tea culture and milk tea culture dominates much more, so you can find a shop like Chagee, HEY TEA, or another milk tea place that has a cafe style setup you could potentially work in. But overall, I did not find suitable work/study cafes outside of the big chains. 

**Cambodia (7.5/10)**

Cambodia surprised me, in that there were many beautiful working/studying cafes in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap. I thought the coffee quality was decent, and it was not hard to find these cafes in the city centers. One in particular, ""Brown Coffee"", which is a famous chain in Cambodia, I thought was relatively spacious, had decent Wi-Fi, and relatively good coffee but I do recall it being a little more expensive. I think it is justified given that you can hang out there for a while. 

**Summary**

Just my quick takes on various countries in the Asia Pacific region and how I've found their coffee and cafe cultures.

I've been working out seriously for the last 3 months, eating between 180-200 grams of protein a day, and tracking a ~600 calorie deficit through Macro Factor.

Last month, I was getting frustrated at the lack of movement on the scale, as I've been really disciplined with my food intake, making sure to even track things like creamer in coffee and oil when I'm cooking, and have been hitting the gym 4 times a week. My gym has one of those ""inBody"" scales that is supposed to give you your body composition, and I decided to pay for a couple uses.

When I used it last month, I was registering at 272 lbs, 69.8 of which were body fat. Today, I registered at 268 lbs, but it showed that my fat was down to 61.5 and that I had gained 4 lbs of muscle, which would match the math of a net 4 pounds lost between 272 and 268.

Now, I know that 4 pounds of muscle in a month is a lot, but does that sound like something that's plausible, given that I'm new to the gym? I've been consistently moving up in weight on my sets throughout this period, and have noticed more visible muscle, but I just want to make sure that there's not something that I'm missing. I've heard that newbie gains can be pretty significant compared to someone who's been going to the gym for a while, and I don't expect to keep seeing results like this if it's accurate, but if it is accurate, it is a little encouraging to see ",1,1746164282.0,beginnerfitness,3,1.0,False

1kctfs7,https://www.reddit.com/r/hyatt/comments/1kctfs7/seattle_big_3_review_thompson_olive_8_regency/,"Seattle ""big 3"" review"":  Thompson, Olive 8, Regency","Hi all, new profile so hopefully this doesnt get taken down for being too new (Ive already received nasty grams), but this is a sincere post and trying to be helpful.  Ive been ""brand explorer"" chasing, and this is a great city to lock in three of them.  I was actually looking at notching Thompson and the ""vanilla"" hyatt at Olive 8.  Hyatt Regency at 299 a night was a great category 4 voucher utilization.

Thompson:  Biggest strength is its location, location, location.  You're a stones throw from Pike Market and some great coffee and breakfast/brunch options.  Biscuit Bitch (yes, thats what its called, and yes its amazing) is literally right next door, and Id highly recommend it.  Get the Hot N Spicy Bitch and a Spicy Nutmeg Pumpkin Latte, and its a great start to the morning.  Thompson's breakfast was surprisingly underwhelming.  If I was paying out of pocket for that I would have been furious, but I wasnt.  The downside is this property seems to nickel and dime you for taxes and service fees much more than the other two.  Bed was very comfy, but pillows felt a little under par for the quality I was hoping for.  Felt slightly above Best Western fare.  They had one firm pillow and one super soft pillow, I ended up stacking two firms and 1 soft to get the support I needed.  Shower pressure was great, no issues there.  The ""high brow"" clientele situation was annoying, but I have absolutely no issue rolling into breakfast in sweatpants and pajamas, so Ill let them judge.

Olive 8 & Regency:  So neatly and randomly enough, these properties are literally right across from each other, and the difference is absolutely minimal.  In fact, the Olive 8 is a cat 5, and I think I booked it for 10 dollars less than the Regency would have cost, which was 299 (again, free voucher poaching).  I literally stayed at Olive 8 for the ""brand"" notch, and walked right across the street to the Regency for my free voucher........maybe 50 years away.  Super convenient.

Olive 8:  they threw me on second highest floor, so that was nice of them.  Tub was above average sized, and I had a very large room.  Sheets and bed were comfy, and pillows seemed to be slightly better quality than the Thompson.  Restaurant was visibly better too.  I forget the name, but it absolutely was better than the Thompson's for a cheaper price point.

Regency:  Probably THE best brand explorer room Ive booked.  This thing retailed at 299, and I got it free.  The only downside is its 1023 pm here and 75 degrees in the room.  I have no idea how Im going to get a wink of sleep before my flight.  Location is GREAT for local restaurants.  less than a half mile north........I would recommend a sushi place called Momiji.   Top notch and very fresh.  And if sushi or seafood isnt something you like.........wtf are you even doing in seattle (I kid, theres actually plenty of options around this neighborhood surprisingly).  Havent laid on pillows yet but I think Im going to be sleeping naked tonight just on pure room temp problems.  the BAR on site here is the biggest thing to write home about.  They have a great whiskey selection and great cocktails.  And Ive heard excellent things bout the restaurant.

Hospitality for all three properties was delightful, I cannot drag any of them for that.  I called up maintenence teams at all three locations to fix the AC, it just wasnt happening.  Thompson could only go down to 65.  Olive 8 could only go down to 66.......monitor never dipped below 67, and Regency I got excited........It said 61, but its 1023 pm and Im sitting here in 75 degrees because the heat seeps through the hallway floor in here.  Im going to be the walking dead for my flight tomorrow.

The BIGGEST knock on all of these locations is unfortunately literally one of my most important benchmarks for a hotel:  AIR CONDITIONING.  When Im spending 300-500 for a room, IDGAF about being green or environmentally friendly.........I better have an AC Unit that can suck in seagulls from Juneau and Kamchatka.  Ultimately.........I am a simple man.  I will graciously accept a House or Hyatt Place that has legit 60 degree air conditioning even over a Hyatt Park or Cat 8 with modest to poor air conditioning........every single time and twice on sundays (scottsdale Andaz......looking sternly and extremely judgmentally at you).  All three of these properties SEVERELY lacked in the AC department.  Maybe not a big deal for you, but it is for me.......and with climate change, its becoming increasingly important (had same issue with Hyatt Centric in Portland a month ago).  All three properties, and the previously mentioned Portland hyatt centric.......I woke up in a puddle, possibly lake, of my own sweat, and that could easily be alleviated by a window that could be cracked.

They're all great properties, but I think I would rank it Regency, Olive 8, Thompson myself end of the day.  If you're an AC afficionado.........you're going to hate your life a bit LOL.  Luckily there's great coffee abound to perk you up after a super shitty night's sleep.

It's similar to any other Bingo game where you get a board and numbers get called fast. The race is to mark the numbers as quickly as you can and grab the most points in the 90 seconds window.  
The best things about playing on Winzo is you get matched with real players and there are no bots in the game which is the biggest green flag for me.

# The Man Behind The Counter

by RespectTheFancy

**–––––––––––– Sunday, October 12, 1969 ––––––––––––**

""Can I help youse?""

Martin Macbeth glared over the register towards the corner of the shop at the man reading today's print of *The Havre Times*, the local newspaper for Havre de Grace, Maryland. Macbeth was a short, plump British man whose drab grey sweater seemed to match his everlasting drab grey mood.

""Hello!?""

The man slowly tilted his head up until he made eye contact. He gave a courteous nod. Macbeth was not amused.

""What're you doing!?""

The man gestured towards his paper. His dark blue suit was strangely formal for this part of town.

The headline was an announcement of the death of Paul Stine, a cab driver shot and killed in San Francisco.

Oct. 12, 1969                                                                                                                  Written by Eric Gould

ZODIAC KILLER STRIKES AGAIN!

Last night in San Francisco, cab driver Paul Stine was murdered in cold blood in the Presidio Heights neighborhood. Authorities believe the shooting is connected to the recent string of killings attributed to the man known only as the ""Zodiac"". Police urge all citizens to remain vigilant. Witnesses describe the assailant as a stocky white male, approximately 5'8"", with short brown hair and thick-rimmed glasses.

""You can't just sit there if youse not gointa buy somethin’!""

""Leave the man alone, Mart,"" sighed George Finney as he walked out of the back room. ""He just wants to read his paper somewhere quiet, away from the busy street. He's not doing any harm.""

""But he's been there for half a bloody hour!"" Macbeth exclaimed.

""So? Who cares?"" replied Finney.

This seemed to have shut Macbeth up.

The man left just before the shop closed. Until then, the day's activities continued as normal; there were a few murmured complaints from Macbeth, but other than that, and the usual flow of customers in and out of the shop, nothing else happened that day.

**––––––––––––– Monday, October 13, 1969 –––––––––––––**

 

The man returned the next day just seven minutes after the shop had opened.

George Finney watched from behind the counter. ""Back so soon?""

The man offered forth naught but a reserved wave and a tap of his newspaper.

Macbeth had not come in yet.

Today's headline of *The Havre Times* told about the robbery of First National Bank.

Oct. 13, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

FIRST NATIONAL BANK ROBBED!

First National Bank was robbed at 9:20 p.m. last night. The suspect, Bogdan Ovyachenko, is still at large for the thievery of $54,700. Suspect is approx. 5'9"". White skin color. Skinny build with a scar on the right cheek. Suspect is believed to still be residing within Havre de Grace.

If you have any information about the whereabouts of Bogdan Ovyachenko, please notify Sheriff Frank Paylor or stop by his office at 102 N 5th St.

The article below was an advertisement for a local bakery, and below that was an update on Paul Stine's funeral date.

 

Macbeth arrived at the shop over three hours late at 11:43 am. He glowered at the man while he settled into his chair, thinking long and hard about what to say in order to create the greatest conflict.

He ultimately said nothing, deciding instead to expend his energy scolding the woman who had come in to try to sell an obviously fake designer watch for a significant markup.

This day went much like the previous. Murmured complaints from Macbeth, and the usual customer flow in and out of the shop. Nothing else happened that day.

 

**––––––––––––––––– Tuesday-Friday, October 14-17, 1969 –––––––––––––––––**

 

The week went on in a similar fashion. The man would show up early, exchange passing glances and the occasional wave with Finney, and then he would sit in the corner until closing time. The days began to stack up. At home on Thursday evening, Finney figured that if the man is to become a regular occurrence in the shop, it may be beneficial to develop a friendship. So, that next day Finney took his lunch break early and sat next to the man. Unsure of how to start the conversation, Finney went with the most basic of questions.

""What are you reading?""

The man looked up, then gestured towards his paper.

Oct. 17, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

METS WIN WORLD SERIES!

The New York Mets went into the day's 5th game of the World Series on the threshold of their first world championship – and nothing about the amazing Mets is more amazing than the way they finally got both feet on the doorstep to the throne room…

""You a baseball fan?"" asked Finney.

The man nodded.

""Damn, guess the Orioles lost, huh?""

The man nodded once more.

""Although I guess if not the Orioles, I would want the Mets to win, so it worked out. Jack DiLauro is a family friend of mine. By the way, I don't think I ever properly introduced myself. I'm George Finney, nice to meet you.""

Finney offered his hand, reluctantly shook by the man.

""What's your name?""

Now this was a question the man seemed to think too personal of a question to ask, so with this, he turned back to read his paper and thus the conversation ended.

 

**–––––––––––––––––– Saturday, October 18, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next day, Finney was alone in the shop early. Macbeth had called out, citing ""a bloody nose that wouldn't stop"" though George suspected he'd simply gotten drunk.

The man came in right on time.

""Mornin',"" Finney greeted, raising a hand and offering a smile.

The man gave the usual small wave.

Finney walked over to the man, seated in his usual spot, and read the headline over his shoulder.

Oct. 18, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL MAN MISSING

Sheriff Frank Paylor has reported that Robert ""Bobby"" Driscoll, aged 31, was last seen two nights ago leaving the Rusty Crab Tavern wearing a red sweater. Driscoll, described as 6'0"" and slender with brown hair, has not been heard from since.

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed his chin. ""That's a shame. Bobby was an old friend.""

The man said nothing.

Customers trickled in. A lady bought a set of used candlesticks. A kid came in to trade baseball cards. The hours passed slowly and Finney was up to his knees in work behind the counter.

Once, Finney thought he caught the man watching him, but his eyes quickly returned to his paper.

By 5 p.m., the man was still there, reading.

 

**––––––––––––––––––– Sunday, October 19, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next day, the corner store opened late at 1 p.m., as is usual for them on Sundays.

By the time Finney arrived around noon, the man was already sitting outside. He followed Finney into the store.

Macbeth staggered in as close to 1 p.m. as possible without technically being late. He was mumbling something about artificial sweeteners.

He looked across the store at the man. The man was staring back.

""Coulda used you yesterday, Mart,"" Finney said dryly.

""Yeah, well, I had that headache, mate, remember?"" Macbeth snapped back.

Finney couldn't help but smirk. ""Thought it was a nose bleed?""

Macbeth grunted.

""That too.""

The man was still staring. Macbeth made a face, and the man returned to his paper.

Finney sighed and made his way over to the chair in the corner.

""What's today's headline?"" asked Finney. But the man still had yesterday's issue.

Oct. 18, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

Any sightings or information on his whereabouts should be reported immediately.

Finney rubbed the back of his neck.

""Paper not come today?"" he asked, leaning over slightly.

The man said nothing.

Finney gestured toward the door. ""Mailman usually drops off the new batch around the side. I can grab you one real quick if you–""

Before he could finish, the man reached out and grabbed his arm. His touch wasn't violent, but it was firm enough to make Finney pause.

The man shook his head once, slow but deliberate.  
Finney blinked, surprised.

""Alright then,"" he chuckled nervously, easing back. ""Yesterday's issue it is.""

 

The rest of the afternoon drifted by lazily. A few customers trickled in: an old woman hunting for a brass lamp, a teenager picking through used comic books, an old man who rang up a case of Coca-Cola and a pack of Lucky Strike cigarettes.

At half past two, the baseball kid came back in, clutching something.

""Hey, Mr. Finney!"" he called.

Finney glanced up from sorting a box of records. ""Hey there, kid. Whatcha got?""

The boy grinned and held up a baseball card. Autographed.

""It's Jack DiLauro! Got it from a trade this morning!""

Finney smiled and motioned the kid over. He took the card carefully, admiring the glossy surface.

""Now that's a good pull,"" he said, handing it back. ""You know he's a family friend of mine? I just may even get you a chance to meet him some day. You hang onto that one.""

The kid's eyes were glowing.

The man in the corner watched, his paper drooping slightly as he peered over it. His expression, as always, was unreadable.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––– Monday, October 20, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, Monday, brought an angry kind of rain – a slashing, sideways rain that rattled the windows and puddled the sidewalks before noon.

The shop still opened in the storm. Macbeth was, predictably, absent again.  
Finney shook his head as he hung up his jacket, water dripping onto the floor.

He was about to switch on the coffee pot when the bell above the door jingled.

The man.

Soaked from head to toe, his usual newspaper clutched beneath his coat.

""You're a brave soul,"" Finney said, flipping on the coffee machine. ""Come. Warm yourself up. Coffee's on the house today.""

Finney poured two mugs, sliding one across the counter toward the man.

The man stared at it for a long while, as if trying to figure out what it was. Finally, he lifted it carefully and took a tentative sip.

Finney smiled to himself.

Small victories.

 

As the man sat, Finney caught sight of the newspaper under his arm – still the same issue from October 18th. But this time, something was different.

Finney blinked.

There, scrawled messily in wet, partially smeared red ink were two words circled in the news blurb: *red sweater*.

The man said nothing.

 

The day dragged on, rain hammering against the windows like the steady patter of a drum.

Around 4 p.m., the front door jingled again.

A man walked in. Tall, wiry, twitchy. He walked over to the register.

Finney barely had time to process it before the man pulled a pistol from his jacket and slammed it down on the counter, pointing it straight at Finney's chest.

""Empty the till,"" the man growled in a heavy accent. ""Now.""

Finney's hands shot up instinctively. His heart thundered in his ears.

He swallowed, glancing at the man's face. A scar carved down his right cheek like a fault line.

Bogdan Ovyachenko. The bank robber.

Behind him, the man in the blue suit folded his newspaper silently.

""Don't make me say it again!"" barked Ovyachenko, jabbing the gun forward into Finney's gut.

Finney fumbled with the register, sweat slicking his palms. His mind raced.

He had to get help. Somehow.

It was then he noticed the man in the blue suit out of the corner of his eye.

He was standing up, slowly, almost casually. His face blank. Calm.

 

In one fluid movement, the man picked up the scalding hot coffee pot from the warmer and, without hesitation, flung its contents across the room.

Ovyachenko screamed, staggering back as the steaming liquid hit him square in the face. A gunshot rang out, piercing the air with a deafening crack.

Finney ducked instinctively, hitting the floor behind the counter as shards of ceiling tile and dust rained down. For a moment, everything was chaos – the metallic scent of blood and burnt coffee hanging thick in the air.

The man had already moved to disarm Ovyachenko, wrestling the weapon from the gunman's slippery, burned hands with surprising strength.

Finney didn't wait – he bolted for the phone and jabbed at the rotary dial, calling the sheriff's office.

""Armed robbery! Ovyachenko's here! Corner store! Send someone quick!"" he shouted.

Within minutes, the bell above the door jingled again – Sheriff Paylor stormed in, gun drawn.

""Drop it!"" he barked.

The man released Ovyachenko and stepped back, hands raised.

Ovyachenko dropped to the floor, howling, clutching his scorched face.

Paylor cuffed him without a second thought, muttering curses under his breath.

Meanwhile, the man calmly took a napkin – a pre-folded wet wipe from his jacket pocket – and wiped down his coffee cup with meticulous care, especially the handle.

Once finished, he used the wipe to place the cup upside down on the counter and, without a word, slipped out the door into the pouring rain.

Finney just stood there, breathless, hands still trembling, as Paylor took his witness statement.

 

**––––––––––––––––––––– Tuesday, October 21, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, Finney opened the shop alone.

The man did not come.

Macbeth did.

He swaggered in just before noon, shaking water from his umbrella and wearing a smug grin.

""Looks like your mate ain't here today,"" he said, voice thick with satisfaction.

Finney's jaw tightened.

""He saved my life yesterday, you know,"" he said sharply. ""While you were at home 'recovering' from whatever you drank yourself into.""

Macbeth scoffed.

""Saved your life, my ass. Probably just looking to make himself the hero. You're just a gullible sod.""

Finney slammed a ledger down on the counter, startling a middle-aged woman browsing the candy rack. The woman looked up briefly, then turned back to her shopping without so much as a glance at Macbeth.

""He's a better man than you,"" Finney snapped. ""At least he showed up! At least he gave a damn! Where the hell were you, huh?""

Macbeth's face turned purple.

""This is your own bloody fault for being soft,"" he spat, ""And befriending that bloody weirdo you dragged in off the street.""

""THE WEIRDO IS THE ONLY REASON I'M STILL STANDING HERE!"" Finney shot back, stepping out from behind the register.

His voice tangled into a harsh, ugly knot of shouting.

The customers, what few there were, scuttled out hurriedly, clutching their purchases.

Even the baseball kid backed toward the door, wide-eyed and confused.

Macbeth leaned towards Finney, grabbing his arm. ""You think he's better than me?"" he hissed. ""You think you're *safe* with him? Some mute freak who watched you all day like a bloody hawk with a secret affection?""

""You know what, Mart?"" Finney started, clearly annoyed, ""I don't want to hear it. The only reason anyone puts up with you is because they're too damn tired to argue. As am I. I'm not listening to your bullshit anymore today. Go home or I'll call Frank and have you escorted out.""

With a furious grunt, Macbeth shoved the stack of newspapers off the counter, sending them tumbling to the floor in a crumpled heap.

""To hell with this place. To hell with *you*,"" he spat, grabbing his coat from the rack.

As Macbeth stormed out the door, Finney caught a glimpse – just for a moment – of a figure standing across the street under a crooked streetlamp.

A dark blue suit.

The man.

But when Finney blinked, the corner was empty.

Gone like smoke.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––– Wednesday, October 22, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––**

The next day felt different.

The rain had finally stopped, leaving the air thick and heavy.

Finney opened the shop alone, the ""Help Wanted"" sign still taped crookedly to the front window.

At 8:07 a.m., the bell over the door jingled.

Finney glanced up, expecting the usual nod, the usual silent shuffle toward the corner.

But instead, the man walked straight behind the counter and pulled out the stool usually reserved for employees.

Finney blinked. ""Uhm… hello?""

The man said nothing.

Instead, he adjusted the cash register, wiped down the counter with a folded napkin from his pocket, and stood patiently behind the till.

Finney just stared.

The baseball kid wandered in then, a crumpled dollar in his hand and a shiny new pack of cards on his mind.

""Hey Mr. Finney! Got any Topps left? I'm chasing Mickey Mantle!""

The man silently rang him up – quicker and neater than Finney ever did – giving the kid his change with a small nod.

""Thank you, Mr. Finney!"" The kid grinned, completely unfazed, and skipped out the door.

Finney still half-expected to wake up.

""Guess you're hired,"" he mused.

 

The peace didn't last.

At exactly 11:39 a.m., Macbeth came stomping in, dragging a fresh foul mood and an equally foul aroma behind him.

He stopped dead at the sight of the man working at the front counter.

""What the bloody hell is *this?!*"" Macbeth shrieked, pointing an accusatory finger.

Finney sighed, setting down a crate of old magazines. ""He's helping out.""

""HELPING OUT?! ARE YOU BLOODY INSANE?! YOU CAN'T JUST–""

""Maybe he saw the type of worker you are,"" Finney cut him off sharply, ""The type of *person* you are – and figured someone ought to do the job properly. Maybe he figured it out when I almost got *shot* while you were passed out drunk!""

Macbeth's face twisted into something dark and furious.

""You think you're some hero now, Finney? Think you're some martyr because you weren't shot by some Soviet bank robber?"" Macbeth jeered, red-faced and breathing hard.

Finney could smell alcohol in his breath. He felt something break inside him, like a tether snapping loose.

""No, Martin, I think I'm lucky,"" he said, his voice low and shaking, ""Lucky I had someone there who actually cared. One who doesn't hide behind excuses and leave his friends to fend for themselves while he drinks himself to death, alone in his apartment, on *a monday* of all days, just because he doesn't know how to handle a divorce like a normal fucking person.""

A deafening silence followed, broken only when Finney continued.

""I can see now, by the way. I can see why Carol left you. You're not smart. You're not tough. You're just pathetic. Always have been. And you're a very, very sorry excuse for a husband. You're lucky she left you the house, but I bet that, too, was out of pity.""

Macbeth's mouth worked open and closed like a dying fish.

Without another word, he turned and stormed out, rattling the glass in the frame as he slammed the door.

Second day in a row.

Second time he left the shop in ruins behind him.

 

The rest of the afternoon passed strangely quiet.

The man continued to work alongside Finney like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Checking customers out. Organizing the comic books. Straightening the rack of chewing gum.

Still silent.

Still watching.

By the time he flipped the ""Closed"" sign at 7 p.m., Finney almost felt like they had settled into a rhythm.

He was wiping down the counter when the man spoke his first full sentence.

""You were there Thursday night. At the Rusty Crab.""

The words were quiet.

Measured.

Final.

Finney froze, the rag slack in his hand.

""I… no,"" he stammered. ""No, I wasn't. I was home. I was–""

But when he looked up, the man was already gone.

 

That night, Finney trudged home under the eerie orange glow of the streetlights.

The world felt… off. Like the ground had tilted slightly, just enough to make walking strange.

When he reached his apartment door, he noticed it immediately.

A small box, sitting neatly at the foot of the doorframe.

Wrapped in torn, faded red paper.

No note. No name.

Finney crouched down slowly, heart hammering in his chest.

He peeled away the damp paper with trembling fingers.

Inside was a red sweater.

Simple. Itchy-looking.

Exactly like the one described in the missing person report.

Finney stared at it for a long, long time, the weight of it growing heavier in his hands by the second.

Across the street, under the halo of a streetlamp, he thought – no, he *knew* – he saw the faint outline of a man in a dark blue suit.

Watching.

Waiting.

 

Finney barely slept that night.

The red sweater sat balled up in the corner of his apartment, like a bloodstain he couldn't scrub out.

When he finally drifted into a light, uneasy sleep, he dreamed of water. A river. Pulling him along the shore. Pulling him out to sea, out to sea so far even the lighthouses wouldn't spot him. Pulling him away from Havre de Grace. Away from Maryland. Away from his corner store. Away from Macbeth. Away from the man in the blue suit. Away from that cursed red sweater that still sat crumpled, across from the windowsill, where the moonlight illuminated the bright red fabric…

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––– Thursday, October 23, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Finney woke abruptly a few minutes before his alarm. He found himself staring at the ceiling until it went off. He continued staring, unsure what to do, as it wailed uselessly on the nightstand. Does he go back to work? Does he leave town? Does he go to the sheriff? No, he couldn't go to the sheriff. Or leave town. Not yet. He needed answers.

The corner store bell gave a weak jingle as Finney slipped inside, the morning sun hidden behind a suffocating wall of gray clouds.

The man, of course, was already there. Next to the register, he was wiping down the counter with his usual napkin.

A newspaper sat folded neatly on the part of the counter that had already been wiped.

Finney hesitated near the door. The man nodded politely. Finney said nothing.

Finally, Finney crossed the creaky wooden floor, pretending to busy himself with the battered crate of records stacked by the far wall. His fingers leafed through dusty sleeves – Johnny Cash, The Supremes, Wanda Jackson – but his mind was elsewhere.

On the box at his door.

On the sweater.

On the man.

The tension grew thicker than bisque.

 

Finally, he spoke, voice low. ""I saw you yesterday. After you left. Across the street from my house.""

The man gave no reaction.

Finney swallowed. The Jimi Hendrix record in his hands suddenly felt too fragile, too loud. He set it down carefully and turned.

""You left a box. A little *gift*. Right outside my door.""

The man still didn't look up.

Finney took a slow step forward.

""I think you know what was inside,"" he continued, trying to keep the tremor out of his voice. ""A red sweater.""

Still nothing.

Finney exhaled sharply through his nose as he walked right up to the counter. ""It was Bobby's, wasn't it?"" He curled his right hand into a fist, pounding it on the smooth Formica. ""Wasn't it?!""

Finally, the man shifted slightly, the barest flicker of movement.

A breath.

A blink.

Finney's eyes darted down – and that's when he noticed it.

An edition of *The Havre Times*, two days old, lying on the table between them.

Oct. 22, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

DRISCOLL FOUND DEAD IN BAY

Authorities have confirmed that the body of Robert Driscoll, reported missing last Friday, has been recovered at the mouth of the Susquehanna River near the Chesapeake Bay. Driscoll, aged 31, was found by Sherrif Paylor following an anonymous tip. He was not wearing his red sweater. Havre de Grace Police Department has not released an official cause of death, but foul play is suspected. Locals are urged to remain vigilant.

 

Finney's stomach twisted.

There it was, in black and white.

*Missing his sweater.*

*Foul play.*

He looked back at the man, whose eyes were now steadily fixed on him.

""Did you… kill him?"" Finney asked, voice cracking on the last word.

A customer jostled the door open, rattling the bell, cutting the tension like a blunt knife.

Finney jerked back instinctively, pasting on a shaky smile as a young woman wandered in, carrying a leather handbag and a handful of loose change.

The man slowly folded the newspaper shut, creasing it neatly, and tucked it under his arm.

Finney watched him for a long, taut second before forcing himself back behind the counter. He felt like he was walking across a tightrope suspended above the Grand Canyon.

The conversation was over.

For now.

The woman smiled politely as she set down a pack of sewing needles and a jar of Granny Hawkins' Old-Fashioned dill pickles.

Finney rang her up on autopilot.

 

The day carried on like a tired sigh.

Customers came and went – some looking for canned soup, some poking through the comic bins, one elderly man who insisted the store used to carry lemon drops and demanded to speak to the ""soused Englishman"" who sold them to him years ago.

Finney tried to act normal. He even cracked a few jokes.

But his mind kept drifting back to the newspaper.

To Bobby.

To the man, whom he kept his distance from.

The minutes crawled by. The sky outside shifted from gray to dark gray to the charcoal-blue of dusk.

At 6:57 p.m., just before closing, the man stood and walked quietly to the door.

Finney moved to follow. ""Hey! I'm not-""

But the bell jingled, the door swung shot, and by the time Finney stepped outside, the man was gone.

Finney sighed and returned inside, ready to flip the sign to ""Closed"", when the door slammed open again.

""Wait! Wait!""

The baseball kid skidded across the tile, breathless, clutching a few coins and a bent dollar.

""You're still open, right?!""

Finney blinked, then smiled faintly. ""Geez, kid. Barely. Whatcha need? Still after Mickey Mantle?""

""Yes, sir!"" The kid raced to the counter, eyes wide with excitement. ""Topps pack, please! The red foil one!""

Finney rang him up, tossed in a Bazooka gum for free, and watched as the boy bolted out again into the night, ripping the foil open before he even reached the sidewalk.

Then the shop was quiet once more.

Finney locked the door.

And left.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––––– Friday, October 24, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The next morning, the sun was unusually sharp for October.

Finney arrived early. The man was already there.

As usual.

They exchanged no words. Finney didn't try. Not today.

The hours passed without incident. The store had fallen into its familiar rhythm – customers drifting through like ghosts, Finney restocking shelves, the man ringing up purchases.

At noon, the bell above the door jingled.

Macbeth.

He paused at the entrance, as if expecting to be yelled at.

Finney just looked up from the register and said flatly, ""What do you want?""

Macbeth gave a long sigh. ""Just grabbin' me things.""

He shuffled behind the counter and crouched to rummage through his desk drawer. For once, he wasn't yelling, muttering, or grumbling about government conspiracies. He didn't even seem intoxicated.

Just quiet.

Finney glanced over. ""You find what you need?""

Macbeth held up a crumpled photograph of a striking woman and an old tin of breath mints. ""Just the essentials.""

He straightened up. Hesitated.

 

""Y'know, George,"" Macbeth started, ""You've been a good mate for years, but you're a bloody hypocrite.""

Finney raised an eyebrow. ""Come again?""

""You blew up at me for leaving you to handle the shop alone."" Macbeth's voice wasn't angry. More tired than anything. ""But I've never pouted when you've gone off an' done the same thing to me. Last Christmas. Independence Day weekend. End of September. Bloody hell, you did it two weeks ago!""

Finney cocked his head, looking confused. ""I don't-""

""No."" Macbeth cut him off. ""Save it for someone who still cares.""

They stood there in silence for a minute. Finally, Macbeth huffed and shook his head.

""For the record, I still don't trust 'im."" He jerked his thumb toward the corner, where the man was stacking books. ""That weirdo you replaced me with. Saw him outside my house on Tuesday when we last spoke. He wasn't watching me, he was watching the road, but still. I don't like him. And I don't like *you* with him. Just… be careful, mate, alright?""

Finney didn't answer.

Macbeth didn't wait for one.

He turned and left, the bell over the door jingling faintly behind him.

 

That night, Finney didn't eat dinner. He didn’t even turn on the lights. He just sat in his kitchen, watching the faint glow of the moon as it crawled across his floor.

Watching the new box he discovered on his porch, slightly smaller than the one that held the sweater from before but still wrapped in the same faded red paper.

He wanted nothing to do with this new box.

But he had to open it. Right?

Finally, he built up the courage to grab it. He set it down on his kitchen table before slowly peeling it open.

Inside was a baseball card.

The blue ink of the autograph glistened in the moonlight.

Jack DiLauro.

The same card he'd seen five days ago.

The same card the kid traded for.

There was a slip of folded paper taped to the back of the card.

Finney staggered back against the doorframe, heart hammering so loudly he could hear it echoing in his ears.

Written on the paper were four words, scrawled in tight, shaky handwriting.

""You were there too.""

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––––– Saturday, October 25, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Saturday morning, Finney didn't go to the shop.

He couldn't.

He sat at his kitchen table for hours, staring blankly as Jack DiLauro's face smiled back at him.

The four words – *You were there too* – burned into his brain like a metal brand.

Finally, around noon, his nerves frayed to threads, he picked up the card and shoved it deep into the back of his junk drawer, under an old newspaper.

Out of sight, out of mind.

He told himself he'd call Macbeth. Tell him everything. Tell him he was right all along.

But when he dialed Macbeth's number, there was no answer.

He called again, only for the same result.

Nothing but the repetitive chime of a reorder tone indicating a disconnected line.

Finney slammed the phone down so hard it cracked the receiver.

 

He didn't sleep at all that night. He sat up in his bed, staring at the sweater balled up in the corner. As if it would move if he looked away. Eventually, he fixed his gaze onto his reflection in the mirror on the wall. His reflection that didn't care whether he was good or bad, happy or

depressed, scared or lonely. His reflection that was always the same stupid face staring back at him.

He began to move restlessly from room to room, glancing out the window in the kitchen at the crooked streetlamp across the road. It flickered now and then, buzzing faintly, casting long, strange shadows.

Once, just once, he thought he saw the man standing there again.

But when he blinked, it was only a twisted blue mailbox.

Eventually, he returned to his bed.

It was then that he finally got some rest, if only for a few hours.

 

**–––––––––––––––––––––––––– Sunday, October 26, 1969 ––––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

Just as the first rays of sun began to crack through the blinds, Finney woke up, crawling out of bed and back into the kitchen. With shaky fingers, he dug into the junk drawer and pulled out the baseball card again, throwing the old newspaper that sat over it onto the kitchen table.

He stared at DiLauro's face for a long time before carefully slipping the card into his wallet and forcing himself to prepare breakfast.

Toast. Burnt. A hard-boiled egg. A glass of the milk he borrowed from his store.

Nothing tasted right.

He tried to focus on the food, but his eyes kept flicking to the old newspaper.

Finally, he read the headline.

Jul. 29, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL CLERK FOUND DEAD IN HOME

Martin Macbeth, a longtime clerk at Bay View Corner Store, was found deceased in his home yesterday afternoon. Neighbors contacted authorities after noticing a foul aroma and unusual silence. Upon entry, police discovered Macbeth unresponsive on the floor of his living room.

The medical examiner has confirmed the cause of death as acute alcohol poisoning. Bottles of whiskey, gin, and beer were found scattered throughout the residence. Police report no signs of foul play.

Macbeth was 42 years old. Known for his blunt demeanor and loyal tenure at Bay View, he is survived only by his ex-wife, Caroline Hartsoe, who now lives in Nashville and has declined to comment.

Finney dropped his fork.

Egg yolk spurt across the table.

He felt the blood drain from his face.

That couldn't be right. He had spoken to Macbeth yesterday. Hadn't he?

The shouting. The picture of the woman. The tin of mints.

The warning.

But the paper was dated months ago.

 

The rest of the day blurred. He didn't remember getting dressed, only that at some point he was back outside.

Back in front of the corner store.

The bell jingled ever-so faintly as he pushed open the door.

And there he was.

The man. Of course.

Wiping down the counter with that same folded napkin.

Finney stepped inside, the door swinging shut behind him with a creak.

The man nodded.

Finney began walking towards the man. ""Who are you?"" he demanded. ""What do you want from me?""

No answer.

""I don't know what the hell is going on, and I can't help you until I do."" Finney continued. ""What do you want?!""

At last, the man set down the napkin.

When he spoke, his voice was more confident than usual. Not hollow or timid. Just… real.

""You keep asking the wrong questions.""

Finney stared. ""Then what are the right ones?""

The man tilted his head. ""What did you see? What do you remember?""

""I don't-""

""You were there.""

Finney's breath caught.

""You… I didn't…""

""But you did.""

Finney was silent.

The man continued. ""The guiltiest man is he who feigns innocence.""

Finney stammered. ""I- I don't know what you're saying. I don't know what you want from me. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT FROM ME!""

He lunged forward, fury overtaking fear. He grabbed the man's lapel, tried to shove him back–

And stumbled through the air.

There was no one there.

Only the counter.

Only silence.

Finney stood alone.

As he had for some time.

 

**––––––––––––––––––––––––––– Monday, October 27, 1969 –––––––––––––––––––––––––––**

 

The following morning, Sheriff Paylor stood in front of Bay View Corner Store. He sighed.

A young boy had vanished a few days ago.

Paylor thinks the boy ran away from home. His parents swore he'd just gone out late for baseball cards and was to return within the hour.

He checked the store Saturday, but it was closed. He went home and waited on a warrant.

Now, Monday morning, the front door was unlocked. Someone had been there. Warrant in hand, he stepped inside.

The bell jingled overhead.

The place was silent.

The register was untouched.

The comics still in neat stacks.

No sign of George Finney, the sole worker.

Paylor walked slowly toward the counter.

A newspaper sat unfolded beneath the till.

Oct. 25, 1969                                                                                                                 Written by Eric Gould

LOCAL BOY REPORTED MISSING

It was Saturday's issue announcing the boy's disappearance.

Wait – That's odd.

The words ""baseball cards"" in the article's body were circled in red ink.

Next to the paper, Paylor found a one-way plane ticket, scheduled to depart from Baltimore that very morning.

Flight TWA 11 -- BAL to SFO

There was no sign it had ever been used.

*Christ, George*, thought Paylor, *San Francisco?*

There was just one more thing on the counter:

A Jack DiLauro baseball card.

Uncreased.

Autographed.

Two words written on the back.

1kctcxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1kctcxy/im_not_my_best_friends_best_friend_and_i_maybe/,I'm not my best friend's best friend and I maybe never was.,"I've made my first reddit account purely because I need to get this out.

I, 18 male, grew up pretty isolated and didn't have close friends for years. I was pretty quiet and when I did make friends I would normally find out that they were just using me or pity friending me. Because of this, I'm not good at identifying things within friendships and I don't know how to deal with situations like this.

At the end of my sophomore year of high school I met my friend, who I'll call Rome, 18 male. He was nice to me and seemed genuinely interested in me as a person. At the start of our Junior year I joined his friend group where everyone was kind and accepting. I want to make it clear that I love the people in my friend group and although I am hurt by the situation, I don't blame them.

After joining the friend group I met someone who I'll call Julian, 19 male. We became really fast friends and he admitted to me that he had also not really made close friends before. I felt like he understood me and with his help, along with Rome and the rest of the group, I grew in confidence and became more outgoing. By summer, me and Julian were talking about living together after high school and I considered him my best friend. I never told him though, I don't really know if that's something you're supposed to do. I was closer to Julian than I'd ever been to anyone.

Side note: I don't want to come off like I abandon Rome. Yes, he brought be to the friend group but we didn't click like I did with Julian. We don't leave him out and I still consider him one of my favorite people, and he knows this. He also has had a best friend since before we ever met and I think his bf is a very cool/kind guy. Rome is OKAY.

At the beginning of our senior year another guy joined the group. Nick, 18 male. Nick was EXTREMELY shy, more shy than I used to be. But Julian and I through he was really cool and started hanging out with him as trio sometimes and he also came out of his shell. Nick clearly always liked Julian better thought. When I found out they were hanging out one on one I didn't think too much of it. But by the spring semester I started to realize my dilemma. I would ask Julian to hang out and half the time he'd say ""sorry, I'm hanging with Nick."" or ""Nick and I were gonna get coffee, but you're welcome to tag along."" This was also around the time Rome started dating his girl friend. I felt like no one had time for me and was honestly really lonely. (still am.)

In the summer, me and Julian were working at the same place so I got to see him most days. Summer was actually pretty great as we would hang out after work at least three times a week. Yes, Nick was normally there but, after a six hour shift of goofing off with Julian it wasn't so bad. Also, I do still love Nick. I'm writing this out of frustration but Nick didn't actually do anything wrong and he's still fun to be around.

After summer, some of the friend group moved away due to college leaving only myself, Julian, Rome, and Nick in the same city.

Me and Rome started to notice that Julian and Nick were kinda turning into the same person. They dressed the same, they talked the same, they listened to the same music. We started joking that they would start dating. So yeahhh....they started dating. They told us A MONTH AFTER. They didn't tell us they were dating for a full month. They started telling everyone their ""perfect love story."" How they had been best friends basically since they first met, how they knew they were meant for each other. This sounds sappy because I'm writing while angry but they really are happy together and I genuinely think they'll get married some day.

At this point in writing this I don't know what my objective is. I just hate that everyone is choosing other people above me. I hate that no one has seemed to notice how this would hurt me. I've talked to Rome a bit about it and he knows that I don't like that their best friends but other than that I've kept it to myself. I'm just so angry that I can't blame anyone but myself. I can't make people choose me.

And yes, I know the answer is probably just to tell them how I feel. I just can't seem too. I know how guilty they would feel and don't want everyone to feel as bad as me. I'm just heartbroken and angry and theres nothing I can do about it.

I don't know where I went wrong. I think I'm an enjoyable person to be around. I think I'm a good friend.

literally any advise would help. I'm clearly doing something wrong when it comes to friendships. I've had failed friendships before but I could always blame them(seriously, one of them was a shit person)

1kctclw,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1kctclw/d_are_weight_offloading_weight_streaming/,[D] Are weight offloading / weight streaming approaches like in Deepseek Zero used frequently in practice? (For enabling inference on disproportionately undersized GPUs),"As someone from a developing nation which simply cannot afford to keep up GPU purchases with LLM scaling trends, I'm invested in the question of LLM inference in disproportionately low-VRAM environments. For example, would it be possible -- even if with low throughput -- to perform inference on a 100+ billion parameter model, on a device with only 16GB VRAM?

I have looked at doing concurrent computation and host-to-device transfer using parallel CUDA streams, in a different context. The idea of streaming the weights across one by one seems interesting.

I notice most, if not all, of this is available within Deepseek's libraries. 

How does it work out in practice? Is there anyone here who uses Deepspeed Zero or other tools for this? Is it realistic? Is it frequently done?

Well I posted a couple of months ago after reaching goal on 7.5 and moved down to 5mg. I immediately put 3lbs on but felt no hunger or major food noise so even though I was panicking at the speedy weight increase, thought I'd continue. After a week of just keeping to plan it came back off and I settled at 11st 5lbs to 11st 7lbs. I'm 50F and 5ft 11. So never been this low weight before and I like it!  So had my Oushk chat and said I was looking to reduce but ultimately come off it. And they said they'd support whatever I chose. So last month decided to try going to 2.5mg. Made the mistake of waiting till payday and earliest delivery day I wasn't available so had been past jab day by 5days. Not a major problem until the voice inside me said, let's not take it and see how you go. Keep the 2.5 for ""just in case""
So didn't take it. Week one off it was fine. Week 2 I was hungry. And not pecking, but staaarving. But ignored it and drank more water /coffee. Week 3 was when the food noise starting badly. And I was struggling. 9mths of great habits and I felt I was on a serious diet, hungry, craving and even though not doing too bad food wise my weight went up to 11st 9.2lbs. So I had enough and took the jab. Hallelujah!! The food noise has quietened. I'm not that hungry, bit peckish from time to time. But the relief! After two weeks of eating exactly the same as I did on 5mg my weight is 11.8.4lbs, I got it down to 11.7 but its not staying down. I don't know why my weight is slowly going up. My food is exactly the same, if anything with the nice weather my exercise has increased. Going back on 5mg next pen.",1,1746163405.0,mounjarouk,2,1.0,False

I remember that izuku had a close relationship with shigaraki, dabi, shinsou and kurohige, this last one had something similar to a relationship with Compress and some scene where they insinuated that they fucked.

Shinsou joins them after Izuku helped him when he was kidnapped (they were both kidnapped) for hanging out with bad influences and told him something like being a villain he could also help. 

I also remember shigaraki having Fluorescent Shining Stars in his room, many scenes of Izuku and Shoto being in a coffee shop venting about their abusive parents (All for One and Endeavor) and the league of villains watching bad American movies while All for One scolds them. Those are the scenarios I remember the most but not the only ones.



Where it ends (where I left off) Izuku after helping the league escape after retrieving Eri (and saying that Eri and shigaraki were brothers) is caught by the police and is awaiting trial. He and Shoto meet and the latter discovers that his friend was a villain.



The reason why I mentioned being a Spanish speaker is that I heard this FanFic on YT: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXQvK-Eiq0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXQvK-Eiq0) in 2020 and put it in private, my only knowledge is that the author didn't know that Kurogiri was Oboro (so it's before manga chapter 255 which came out on December 23, 2019) it was in English (because the one who uploaded it to Youtube said so in commentary) and that apparently it wasn't classified with gay ships.



I would appreciate your help at this point I am desperate.

I should've never stayed past midnight...,"I asked for extra hours because I’ve been saving to move out of state. My lease ends in three months, and I’ve been desperate to escape this town — you know how small towns are. Once something bad happens, everyone talks about it for a week, then just pretends it never happened. People go missing, and after the candlelight vigils and the posters fade, no one brings them up again. Not here.

Anyway, I’ve been closing the shop for fourteen nights in a row. I know it’s not healthy, but money talks. I figured it was just temporary — scrub down the espresso machine, wipe the counters, restock the pastry case. Lock the doors at 10, clean until 11:30, and I’m usually out by midnight.

The first time I noticed something weird was about five nights in. I heard a knock on the back door.

Not a customer door — the back door. The one in the alley we use for trash and inventory.

It was soft at first. Not aggressive. Just...persistent. Knock. Knock. Pause. Knock knock knock.

I thought maybe it was one of the local homeless guys. We have a few who wander that stretch of downtown. I even left some muffins and a warm cup out there once. But when I looked through the peephole, no one was there.

I opened it anyway. Nothing but the usual stack of empty milk crates and the overpowering stench of old coffee grounds. No wind. No cars passing. Just stillness.

I shrugged it off. I do that a lot — tell myself I imagined things. I’ve always had a vivid imagination, and being tired doesn’t help.

But then it kept happening. Every night.

Knock. Knock knock. Scratch.

Yes, scratching.

I started locking the back door as soon as we closed, keeping the lights dim so the front didn’t look too “open.” Still, around 10:45 or so, the noises would start. I’d turn the music up to drown them out.

One night, about ten days in, I found something tucked under the door: a crumpled receipt from our own register with the words “I LIKE YOUR SKIN” scrawled in black marker across it.

I called my manager. They said to call the cops. I did.

The officer who came out was nice enough, but I could tell he thought I was being dramatic. He looked around the alley, shrugged, and told me not to walk alone at night.

So helpful.

The next night, I brought a box cutter with me. I kept it in my apron pocket and tried not to look nervous.

That was the night I saw him.

I had just finished mopping when I saw something flicker past the glass door. I thought it was a reflection at first, but it stopped. Paused. Then backed up and stood there, staring in.

He was standing in the glow of the streetlight — this man who looked...off. His clothes hung too loose, like he’d lost a lot of weight fast. His face was mostly shadowed by a baseball cap, but I could see his mouth. It was open. Smiling.

I yelled that we were closed. He didn’t move. Just pressed his palm to the glass.

When I stepped closer, my stomach dropped.

There was blood on his fingers.

I backed away slowly, grabbed my phone, and called the cops again. He was gone by the time they arrived. No trace.

After that, I started getting paranoid. I’d come in and find the espresso machine turned on when I knew I left it off. One time the lights flickered, and the stereo started playing by itself — a scratchy, warbling version of a song I didn’t recognize. I thought maybe the place was haunted. That almost would’ve been a relief.

I asked to switch back to day shifts. My manager said no — no one else wanted to close.

I should’ve quit. But I needed the money.

The last night I worked was last Thursday.

It started the same. Quiet. Cold. I didn’t even hear any knocks. I thought maybe whoever it was had moved on.

At around 11:20, I went into the back to grab a mop head.

The light above the supply closet was flickering again. I opened the door, and as I reached up to grab the mop, I heard someone breathe behind me.

I spun around.

Nothing.

Just empty space. The closet was barely big enough for one person, but I swear I felt someone exhale, right behind my neck.

I ran out, heart hammering, and went straight to the front. That’s when I saw it.

Someone was behind the counter.

They were crouched low, rummaging through the cabinet where we keep the spare aprons.

I thought it was a customer at first. I don’t know why. I stepped forward and said, “Hey, we’re closed—”

The figure stood up.

And it was me.

I don’t mean they looked like me. I mean it was me.

Same uniform. Same hair. Same necklace. Same chipped nail polish on the pinky finger.

I froze.

She — it — stared at me for a long time. Then tilted its head.

And smiled.

The smile wasn’t right. It was too wide. The skin stretched at the edges like it didn’t quite fit.

I backed away, shaking. I reached for my phone, but it was gone. I must’ve left it in the back.

Then she — I don’t know what else to call her — spoke.

“I’ve been watching you,” she said, in my voice.

Perfectly mimicked. Except… hollow. Like a voice filtered through broken speakers.

“I like you.”

Then she raised her hand — my hand — and peeled something from her cheek.

It came off like a mask. Like wet fabric being pulled from raw meat.

Underneath, the face was... wrong.

Patchy, mottled skin. Red where it hadn’t healed. Threads. Needles. Bits of scalp sewn together.

She had stitched me into herself.

I don’t remember screaming. I must have, because when I woke up, I wasn’t in the coffee shop anymore.

I was here.

In this room.

It’s small. Bare. Concrete floor. One flickering bulb. The walls smell like mold and something worse — like rotting meat.

She comes in sometimes.

She’s still wearing my skin.

And she talks to me. In my voice. She practices it. Repeats things I’ve said. Gets better every day.

She’s gone back to work now.

No one knows I’m missing yet.

She’s got my phone. My keys. My face.

She’s writing this, too.

She wants you to know how easy it was.

How much she loves being me.

If you come into the coffee shop this week and the girl behind the counter smiles just a little too wide, don’t order anything.

Run.

Plot basis:

Candace, Beck, Love, Delilah, Natalie, Marienne. 

Joe Goldberg has loved and lost many women. He’d, at one point or another, thought they were each *the one*. His true love. *You*. 

But every single time, they ended up hurt because of him, by him. 

(Set after season 4, ignoring season 5.) 

Joe parts ways with Kate, surprisingly amicably. 

Now, moved back to New York with his name completely cleared, he opened his own book store and cafe with an apartment directly above it for himself to live in, along with a basement below the bookshop with his typical cage and rare books, just in case. He built it himself, using Kate’s divorce money to fund it all. 

Now, the end of spring break, summer was coming. It was time to upgrade the shitty cafe setup he had. There was an entire extension on the shop, and that meant needing to hire Atleast one employee to help out. 

He was already being stretched thin managing the book selling, the book exchange and fixing aspects, and the few coffees he sold each day. The new cafe would have pastries, fancy drinks, and lots of seating around the entire store. So yeah, he needed to hire.

The issue? He didn’t like any of the applicants. He refused to hire any women, avoiding his usual obsession at all costs. 

Finally, after hosting eleven different interviews, he sees *You*. (Your character.) 



So yeah that’s the plot! Basically Joe has never thought of himself as bisexual, but seeing your character he begins to see things differently, and instantly falls head over heels into his usual pit of obsession. He hires your character as a barista and secondary book register employee.

For some background I moved into this beautiful place on the water that allows pets and has a shit ton of space on March 21st of this year (2025). Its a very unique building being built in the 1700s and for the most part i LOVE its architecture. But it was built and MAINTAINED in the standard of the 1700s

The failing part of this place is that the structure is rotten from within and im only getting the feel of it now that ive been living here for …. a month and a week….

My first issue was the electric which has 110 voltage MAX. Ive had 3 power outages within the first week of moving in by using a microwave, making coffee, and turning on a light source (a chandelier). Anytime i plug anything in i make sure everything in that room is unplugged just so i dont lose power. As this kept occurring my landlord ended up coming in and putting in a new outlet designated for the fridge alone bc supposedly ALL OUTLETS IN THAT ROOM (living room) run on the same wiring. After the new outlet was placed ive had no problems with losing power. 

The next problem ended up being an odd smell. very disgusting smell and hard to stay in the room (living room). It’s where id typically eat, cook and even sleep if i have my gf over for the night but it feels like its becoming unusable. 

I ended up coming home multiple times to a leak coming from the ceiling. There has been 3 leaks in the same spot and i have deep cleaned the entirety of that room MULTIPLE TIMES. ive cleaned the walls and scrubbed all the floors as well as deep cleaned all the furniture. Smell is very persistent and tends to worsen when heat is on or when i try and use a wax melt. 

My current problem is now my health. Ive had the worst headaches since moving in assuming its stress, but more recently ive developed throat swelling and irritation. It hurts to swallow and almost allergy-like. 

Ive alerted my landlord and honestly hes very chill and laidback and has “fixed” problems before but they all seem half ass. is this on purpose? 

Im getting tired of all of this back and forth and i’m not sure what is the best route to take. 

I dont want to keep living here if it’s barely habitable but i also dont know what i am entitled to and/or im being dramatic. There are THREE rooms and ive only been able to safely feel comfortable in one.

Ok, my budget is about $300 GBP per night. I have got myself in a tail spin, as I’ve located a couple of reasonable hotels around Hyde park (the Darlington looks all right, plus conti breakfast and close to cheapish food instead of restaurants each night for example) “or” an Airbnb around southbank for about the same cost but we could self cater. 

I know we hate Airbnb and have to be quite careful, but the one I’m looking at has a long history, superhosts etc, so please know I realise this is a big choice as well. 

My question is more about the area of southbank vs the area of aforementioned Hyde park. I had a sneaky google street view of southbank, and it seems very quiet - leading me to potentially overthink that at night it won’t be overly safe to walk (even as a group of 4) and that it might be quite the hike from there to across the bridge to the tourist traps we are thoroughly looking forward to…

I know I’m comparing apples to…well…a kettle, really, but your thoughts on the areas for tourists and your two cents worth are thoroughly appreciated (really - this sub has already talked me into half of the itinerary!). If it helps, the travelers with my husband and I are 15 and 18. We will be in the city for 5 nights and intend to see all the big things, mostly on foot or via public transport.

First guy:
Chatting away, having a funny conversation, then he asks me when do I want to see him. Ok, cute. I say tomorrow when I'm wearing a dress. Right? Gotta look pretty. It gets a bit silent after that? So o ask him when does he want to see me and he says today.  🚩 That is .. last minute. A little disrespectful. So I try to push back a little and get it for tomorrow, but ask him what would be the plan? And he goes: ""We could have wine at my place."" 🚩 I go: ""Oh?"" And then before I get to proceed he goes: ""So you can come to me after work?"" 🚩🚩 
So, let me get this straight.
1. You are not taking me out on a proper date, so you don't really care to get to know me. 
2. You want to get an easy lay. 
3. Not only do you want to get an easy lay, you want ME to pay for my own taxi to be treated like a cheap w*ore,  too?? 
So I reply: ""Are you sure you are not a serial rap*ist?"" To which he got offended a little, but I mean ... If you ACT like one?? So I just said: ""It sounds like a booty call. I prefer dates, instead of hookups, but good to know where I stand with you. I think this is a mismatch."" And he went with: ""If that's how you want to take it."" Bla bla bla. Bye. 

Second guy: 
Asks me out for coffee. Great! Let's do that.
He comes picks me up- very nice. 
Doesn't see I'm there, nose in the phone, so doesn't come out to greet me - ok, lazy much?  So I knock on the window and wave, he signals me to get in. Still not getting out of the car to greet me? I think it's basic decency? It's just one of those things that irritate me that I didn't know that irritated me. I mean with first dates. But it happens a lot and I just find it rude. 
Anyhow, I get in, we greet, give him a little hug, we drive off to a cafeteria. I think he is cute, very nice eyes, all good so far. We park the car, get out. He asks if he can drop me off later. At first I was like, no no, I live a bit far away (which I actually do), it's ok. He said it would be a no issue to which I say 'ok, we'll see'. It's normal for guys to drop you off at home after the date here. It's just basic decency thing. 

We get to the cafeteria, I take off my jacket and he goes- loudly- ""Oh wow, you are actually super hot, very sexy."" To which I just smile awkwardly, because wtf man. Keep your voice down?!  And what is that compliment. You can just say: ""you look nice."" ""Thank you."" That's all what is needed. You're doing too much. And then he follows it up with: ""when I send you home, I'm definitely not going back."" 🚩🚩🚩🚩 Ok. THAT is a creepy thing to say. 
Oh and one final thing. When he took off his jacket, there was a smell. This old sweat stinky body smell from a shirt he hasn't washed for a week at least. No. Absolutely not. I can deal with weird compliments, but not bad hygiene. I'm out. 
We kept it short. I left on my own.

I'm an 18-year-old high school senior looking for opinions and advice on my current friend's situation.  I struggle to maintain Friendships due to social anxiety and being shy overall but I do have a couple of friends these friends I'm posting about are a couple of girls I've known through the school year I met two at the beginning of the school year (I'll call them Girl B & C) I also have this other friend (I'll call her Girl A)  Girl A and I have been friends since freshmen year and we use to hang out all the time at each other's houses and we would walk the school hallways every morning before class but after junior year things started to change when Girl A met Girl B they became close friends fairly quickly and eventually Girl B introduced Girl C to girl A the three of them became a trio. Fast forwarding to Senior me and Girl A were staff members of our school's yearbook and that’s where I met Girl B along with Girl C for the first time the first couple of weeks were kinda awkward since I wasn’t comfortable with them quite yet but we slowly formed a pretty normal friendship overall it wasn’t till later in the year around the second semester of school when I noticed something change within Girl B and I’s friendship. Sidenote Before continuing all of us Hispanics and Girl A Girl B  and C all know fluent Spanish and would talk in Spanish all the time except for me since I was adopted from Guatemala my parents are both very white and know have very little Spanish so I never learned it growing up. Ok back on topic as the second semester began I noticed changes in my friendships Girls A, B & C always made plans together outside of school like hanging out at each other houses going out to buy coffee, etc but at first, it didn’t bother me since I figured there a little trio and they always hanged out but it got to the point where they started to make their plans right in front of me. One time in class I remember Girl C saying “Let all three hangout” pointing to everyone but me they also always teased me for not knowing Spanish at first it also didn’t bother me since I found it funny but Girl C also said right in front of my face  “let’s all speak Spanish so she can feel left out”  pointing toward me I know she meant it at a joke but it still kinda got to me making me feel embarrassed by not knowing Spanish. At first, I thought to myself maybe I was the problem and maybe my humor wasn’t funny to them and maybe it came off mean to them. As an example, girl B would ask me if she had something in her face and I would jokingly say Yes but quickly say just kidding it seemed to just piss her off every time so I started to refrain from making jokes or teasing her back. 

Somehow they convinced me to go to prom with them saying it would be fun and that it was my senior year and I should go so I agreed. We took photos at a nice park but the whole time I was mainly standing and watching as they took photos with their dates they offered to take some solo photos for me but I declined since I don't like taking photos of myself and I didn't care for photos anyways since I probably wasn't going to post them. (girl C was somewhere else taking photos)  but Girls A and B  made me hold their bags and jackets as they took photos which I didn't mind since the ground was dirty but after they finished up in the spot they were at and started moving towards a new one  I asked them if they could take their stuff back since I didn't want to be carrying it the whole time and but both of them just ignored me or said no I can't remember clearly but Girl A’s date whom I just met that day offered to carry her stuff which I felt bad but also confused why she could carry her small bag. But the after photos the rest of the night was normal and I pretty much stood at a tiny table for the majority of the dance. 

There are tons of more examples and issues that have happened and rubbed me the wrong way but I don't want to write a small book lol. Overall I've confided with my therapist and other friends outside of this group about this whole situation and they all say the same thing that I'm not overthinking it and that they're being straight-up mean to me. Side note I've never had issues with Girl  A she kinda just changed after meeting Girl B and C and it is mainly Girl B I have issues with but I don't know anymore I'm scared to confront them and say something about it possible just tk be overthink it and they think I'm being mean or I'm accusing them if something and j just want peoples  thoughts on this am I over thinking this?",1,1746161606.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

***PRODUCER (lightly frustrated):*** We’re running low on fresh content. We’ve done food folklore, haunted hotels, abandoned resorts... What else is left that hasn’t been overdone?

***RESEARCHER***: We could dig into local urban legends again?

***PRODUCER***: Already planned for next month. We need something different. Something... obscure. Something real.

***EMAIL MANAGER (hesitantly)***: Um... there’s this one thing. Been sitting in the inbox for weeks. I thought it was spam at first, but... it's weirdly persistent.

***PRODUCER (turning around)***: Go on.

***EMAIL MANAGER:*** Some guy — same email every time. Keeps sending us these long entries. Like diary entries. No subject line, no message body. Just attachments. Every single one starts with “Dear Diary.” And the tone? It’s not fiction. It feels real. Almost like… a confession.

***HOST (intrigued)***: What’s the sender’s name?

***EMAIL MANAGER:*** Jonas Drexler. German food vlogger. I looked him up. He’s real. Or was.

***RESEARCHER:*** Wait — was?

***EMAIL MANAGER:*** He disappeared. Last posted a vlog from Malaysia almost a year ago. After that — silence. Comments are full of people asking where he went. Some think he’s dead. Others think he just ghosted the internet.

***PRODUCER:*** And you think these diary entries are from him?

***EMAIL MANAGER:*** The writing matches his voice in the vlogs. Even mentions places we can verify. But it gets darker as it goes on. There’s something off about it.

***HOST (quiet, considering):*** This could be something... Something real. Creepy. Personal. Unfiltered.

***PRODUCER:*** So what do we do?

***HOST:*** We run it. We call it Dear Diary. Each episode, we read one of his entries — exactly how he wrote them. No edits. No disclaimers. If it’s a hoax, fine. But if it’s not... our listeners need to hear this.

**THE PODCAST**

  
**Host:** Hey there, night owls — and welcome back to another episode of The Hollow Hour.

I’m your host, Eli. And tonight... we’re doing something a little different.

Usually, we bring you a one-off horror tale — folklore, urban myths, or spine-tingling confessions from our listeners around the world. But this time… this one found us.

For the past few months, someone’s been flooding our inbox with the same emails — again and again. Same name. Same subject. Same file attached.

We almost ignored it — until we didn’t.

What we found was... disturbing. Intimate. And strangely real.

These were diary entries — supposedly written by a German food vlogger who vanished in Malaysia last year. No trace. No goodbye. Just silence.

The only thing left behind… were these words.

So we decided to read them — exactly as we received them.

We’re calling this new segment Dear Diary — a series of unearthed entries that may or may not be fiction… but once you hear them, you might wish they were.

Tonight, we start with the first entry.

This one’s called: ***Pelaris.***

***PELARIS***

Dear Diary,

Finally touched down in Southeast Asia.

Not long ago, I was buried under Canadian snow, editing travel videos and wondering if I'd ever feel the sun again. And now here I am — Malaysia. First stop: the small northern state of Kedah.

From the moment I stepped out of the airport, the air hit me — heavy, humid, buzzing with life. The smell of rain on asphalt, fried noodles from street vendors, and something sweet, like frangipani flowers. Everything felt foreign, but good. Like I'd stepped into a different rhythm of the world.

Before coming here, I'd reached out to a few subscribers — just tossing a message into the wind.

And someone answered.

Hafiz.

A local from a district called Yan. Said his village, Kampung Sungai Batu, was full of hidden gems — waterfalls, orchards, places untouched by tourists.

We arranged to meet. Hafiz offered to be my guide — show me the real side of Kedah.

No fancy resorts, no curated ""cultural experiences.""

Just real life.

After a short hop flight from KL, and a bumpy ride through narrow roads lined with banana trees and rice paddies, I finally arrived.

Hafiz was waiting by the roadside, waving.

T-shirt, jeans, motorbike helmet tucked under one arm — as casual as it gets. He greeted me like an old friend, and within minutes, I felt like I'd known him for years.

First thing he did was show me around the village.

We visited the Lata Bayu Waterfall — a hidden little paradise surrounded by thick jungle. Crystal-clear pools, kids jumping off rocks, families picnicking under the shade.

We wandered through his uncle’s durian orchard, the air thick with that intense sweet-rot smell of ripe fruit.

We stopped at a tiny roadside stall for air kelapa — fresh coconut water, drunk straight from the shell.

It was exactly the kind of adventure I’d been craving.

By lunchtime, the sun was brutal, and Hafiz suggested we get some real food.

He led me to a small food stall called Warung Selera Rasa — a crooked building half swallowed by flowering vines, tucked just off the main dirt road.

The kind of place where the chairs don’t match, and the menu is handwritten on a piece of cardboard.

While Hafiz spoke rapidly to the makcik (auntie) running the place, I looked around.

The smells were incredible — spicy, tangy, rich. Smoke rising from a charcoal grill at the back.

Hafiz ordered for us, proudly introducing me to local specialties.

Not just the famous asam pedas ikan pari (stingray in spicy sour gravy), but also:

Gulai nangka muda (young jackfruit curry) — soft, fragrant chunks of jackfruit stewed with coconut milk and spices.

Ulam-ulaman (raw village herbs and vegetables) served with sambal belacan (spicy fermented shrimp paste).

Peknga (a kind of thick coconut pancake, famous in Kedah, usually eaten with curry).

I pulled out my camera — couldn’t resist filming the spread, the sizzling sounds, the colors.

The asam pedas was electric — tangy and fiery at the same time, the stingray perfectly tender.

The gulai nangka had this creamy, almost meaty texture. The sambal belacan, though... man, that hit like a freight train — spicy, salty, pungent.

I was in food heaven.

Locals came and went, smiling curiously at me but not intrusively.

One thing I noticed though — at the back corner of the warung, there was a dusty, closed-off table, hidden behind some faded old curtains.

No one ever touched it.

No one even glanced at it.

But whatever — I was too busy enjoying my first real kampung meal.

After lunch, Hafiz took me back to his family's house — a simple wooden structure raised on stilts.

No air-conditioning, just big windows open to the breeze and the sound of cicadas.

We chilled for a bit — then, as the afternoon cooled, we decided to lepak (hang out) at the village field.

Kids played tackle (village soccer) barefoot on the grassy field near the school, older boys hanging around motorcycles, laughing and shouting.

Someone brought a guitar.

Someone else started a makeshift sepak takraw match with a worn rattan ball.

It was all so normal.

So easy.

For dinner, Hafiz's mother cooked us a feast — nasi ulam, ikan bakar (grilled fish), and sayur masak lemak (vegetables in coconut gravy).

We ate cross-legged on woven mats, under the lazy spin of a ceiling fan.

Laughter filled the house. Mosquitoes buzzed at the windows. Someone’s uncle fell asleep snoring loudly after dinner.

It was one of the best days I’d had in a long time.

That first night, I fell asleep to the symphony of crickets and distant dogs barking.



\---



Day after day, the pattern continued.

Mornings were spent exploring — fishing trips, visiting a local batik maker, trekking to hidden parts of the jungle.

Afternoons at the waterfall or just lepak-ing by the field.

At first, lunch and dinner were shared with Hafiz’s family or the villagers.

But as I started craving that incredible asam pedas again...

I found myself going back to Warung Selera Rasa.

At first, just for lunch.

Then lunch and dinner.

Then even breakfast, when the makcik started making nasi lemak bungkus daun pisang (banana leaf-wrapped coconut rice packets) early in the morning.

Three times a day.

Almost every day.

It wasn’t just the food.

There was something about that warung.

The warmth.

The smells.

The way it felt like I belonged there.

I barely even noticed how the locals would sometimes glance at me when I walked in.

Or how the makcik’s smile would sometimes falter just a little when I asked for more asam pedas.

I barely noticed... at first.

  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



At first, it was just the asam pedas.

Then it was the gulai nangka.

Then the peknga, then the sambal belacan.

I couldn't stop myself.

Morning, noon, night — I found myself drawn back to the little warung, even when I told myself I'd just have instant noodles back at the homestay.

Some days, I'd wake up before dawn, stomach growling, already craving the spicy, smoky taste.

It didn’t take long before the makcik there knew my order without asking.

She’d smile — wide, almost too wide — and tell me to sit.

Always the same table, right near the window.

Always the same dishes.

Always piping hot, like they'd been expecting me.

At first, it was comforting.

Familiar.

Homey.

But after a few weeks... I started noticing things.

It started with the other customers.

Most days, the warung was bustling, full of the usual village chatter.

But more and more, it felt like I was the only one there — or at least, the only one eating.

The others would sit, murmuring quietly, eyes flickering toward me now and then.

Their faces looked... wrong, somehow.

Pale.

Drawn.

Like their skin didn’t quite fit right over their bones.

One afternoon, after a late lunch, I caught a glimpse of someone — a woman — standing near the curtain that hid the back of the stall.

She wore a long white dress, her hair falling in thick black sheets over her shoulders, almost to her waist.

At first, I thought maybe she was another customer.

Or maybe a family member helping out.

But when I blinked, she was gone.

I tried to laugh it off.

Too much sambal.

Overactive imagination.

Still, the memory lingered like a bad aftertaste.



\---



The real turning point came one rainy evening.

I'd stayed too long, nursing a plate of peknga and sweet black coffee.

The rain was coming down in sheets, drumming on the zinc roof.

The world outside was swallowed by mist and shadow.

The makcik was nowhere to be seen.

The other tables were empty.

Even the usual soft hum of voices was gone — like the warung itself had been wrapped in cotton.

I sat there, alone.

That's when I heard it.

A low, rhythmic chanting coming from behind the curtain.

A language I didn’t recognize — harsh, guttural syllables, repeated over and over.

I froze.

Every instinct told me to leave.

To run.

But something — something heavy and invisible — kept me rooted to the chair.

Through the gap in the curtain, I caught a glimpse:

The makcik — sitting cross-legged on the floor, a cracked clay bowl in front of her.

Inside the bowl: something black and glistening, something writhing.

She was rocking back and forth, eyes rolled back, lips moving in that strange chant.

Behind her, the woman in white stood watching.

Her head tilted unnaturally to one side.

Her eyes empty, hollow.

I stumbled up from my chair, heart hammering against my ribs.

The noise of my movement must've startled them — the makcik's chanting cut off abruptly.

The curtain swayed slightly as if someone had brushed past it.

I didn’t wait to see more.

I bolted into the rain, not even caring that I left my backpack behind.



\---



When I got back to the homestay, soaking wet and shaking, Hafiz was waiting for me.

He took one look at my face and didn't even ask what happened.

He just sighed, heavy and sad.

Like he'd seen this before.

""You kept going back, didn’t you?"" he said softly.

I nodded, unable to speak.

He closed his eyes for a moment, then opened them.

""You have to leave. Tomorrow. Don't eat anything else from there.""

""But... why?"" I croaked. ""What’s happening?""

Hafiz hesitated.

Then, almost reluctantly, he whispered:

""Pelaris.""

The word was unfamiliar.

But the fear in his voice was unmistakable.

Hafiz leaned in closer, looking around like he was scared someone might overhear.

He said it again, softer this time.

""Pelaris.""

I had no idea what that was. I asked him, and he explained — it's some kind of spirit or entity people use to attract customers. Not a talisman, not a lucky charm, but something alive. Or maybe half-alive. Something they ""feed,"" and in return, it draws people in, makes the food irresistible.

Honestly, it sounded insane to me.

I mean — come on. Ghosts? Demons? Spirit slaves?

I'd read enough about Malaysia's superstitions before coming here, but I never took any of it seriously. Folklore, right? Stories for children.

I told Hafiz that.

He just looked at me, dead serious, and said, ""You think I believed it too? Until my friend came.""

He told me about a friend of his — Azwan — who visited from Kuala Lumpur a few weeks back.

Apparently, Azwan has ""the eye"" — he can see things that normal people can't.

They went to that same stall together, the Warung Selera Rasa.

Before they even sat down, Azwan yanked Hafiz's arm and said, ""Let's eat somewhere else.""

When Hafiz asked why, Azwan said he saw it.

The Pelaris.

Standing near the kitchen.

He described it — a woman in white. But not a normal woman.

Her face was... wrong. Like stretched rubber. Her mouth smiling too wide. Eyes black, completely black, no whites at all.

When Hafiz told me that, I swear, every hair on my body stood up.

Because that's almost exactly what I saw — the woman behind the curtain when I was eating there.

I didn't want to believe him.

I still don't want to believe him.

But it matches. Too well.

Hafiz went on to say that after that day, strange things started happening at his house.

Knocking at the windows late at night.

Scratching sounds.

Voices laughing outside, even when there was nobody there.

Shadows moving where there shouldn’t be any.

He tried warning his family. His neighbors.

But they all thought he was just jealous because the warung was doing so well.

They said he was making up stories.

Then he got really serious.

He said if I had seen the Pelaris too — if I had witnessed the chanting, the strange makcik, the thing in the clay bowl — then it meant they knew I knew.

And once you know, you're marked.

He told me I had to leave. Immediately.

Not tomorrow. Not after breakfast. Now.

At first, I thought he was overreacting.

But deep down... something inside me agreed.

The way the air felt heavier tonight. The way the shadows seemed thicker.

The way my skin kept crawling for no reason.

I didn’t argue.

I packed up my stuff, and Hafiz drove me to the bus station.

As we pulled away from the village, I swear I caught a glimpse of something pale standing near the road.

Something... smiling.

I didn’t look twice.

I didn’t want to know.

I go to the one by my place pretty often and i asked if they were  hiring one day when i was getting some coffee they said yes so i put in an application. A few days later i got some more coffee and let them know i put in my application when i picked it up. 


I’m a shift lead at a pizza place and have been working there for almost 2 year and that’s on my resume. The other job on my resume is a different pizza place that i worked at as my first job. I didn’t list the other jobs that i’ve had because they were short term or i’ve gotten fired from them. I wanted to apply for the shift supervisor position but i have no idea how to make coffee so I applied for the Barista position. 



The hiring manager called me and asked me to come in for an interview. At the interview she asked me 4 specific questions and i feel like it was noticeable that i was nervous when i was answering them. These are the 4 questions. They aren’t exactly how she asked them but you get the point. 1. How do you create a positive environment for your coworkers and the customers?
2. What’s an obstacle that you’ve had to overcome in your role at your job? 3. How do you deal with conflict with customers? 4. What does good customer service look like to you if you were the customer.

She asked me what i was looking for and i told her 32 hours a week, and 4 8 hour days a week. That i prefer mornings but i could work anytime and have open availability. She told me that Baristas typically only get 20 to 30 hours a week and that she’s looking for people to work day shift during the week and be available at least one of the weekend days all day. I told her that i’m available on the time and don’t mind to work during the day. 

She asked if i heard about the new dress code and explained that you can only wear black shirts, no painted nails, only one facial piercing, not a lot of jewelry and etc. At the interview i had painted nails and 3 facial piercings so i think that’s why she emphasized the dress code. I asked if it was okay if i took my other 2 piercings out to leave my dermal in because they don’t come out and she said yes. She then said that they would go over that more during the onboarding process. I cant tell if her saying that is a good sign or not because idk why they would mention the onboarding process if they weren’t considering me. 

The interview concluded, she asked me if i had any questions and i said no. Then she said she would reach out to me in 1 to 2 weeks because she’s still interviewing other people and then said something about vacations coming up. I feel like 1 to 2 weeks is a long time and maybe a bad sign that i didn’t get the job. 
Should i apply to the other starbucks as a shift supervisor a few miles away from me if i don’t get the  barista job?

Help!,"Two summers ago, I was in Brazil with my boyfriend when my childhood best friend tragically passed away. I was heartbroken and felt deep guilt for not speaking to him in the months before his death—because my boyfriend didn’t want me talking to other men, even old friends. I left Brazil early to attend the funeral, and while I needed emotional support, my boyfriend was upset I left and didn’t seem to grasp how devastating the loss was. I felt completely alone.

While he remained in Brazil, we had a series of emotional arguments. During one fight, I threatened to break up like we had done in the past, ( as we were young and a little immature at the time) not meaning it. But this time, he agreed. He started expressing doubt about our future and said he wanted to raise his kids in Brazil one day. I was crushed. I had believed we were close to getting engaged. Instead, I spiraled into my lowest point—barely eating, not sleeping, and consumed by anxiety and fear of losing him. Though we stayed together, my sense of emotional safety was badly shaken.

Back at college for my senior year, things were still tense between us, and I felt extremely alone on campus. My best friend had moved off campus, my sister (my roommate) was always with her boyfriend, and most of my other friends had graduated. I prayed to find new friends but struggled. I’ve always found it easier to befriend men, especially since they tend to show interest if they find you attractive. One day, a guy on campus introduced himself, and later we connected on Instagram. He responded to one of my stories, and our conversation led to hanging out.

When we met up to study, and he asked me about my summer. I ended up getting emotional and crying as I opened up about how painful my summer was—losing my best friend, and all the issues I had with my boyfriend. I apologized, and he was kind, telling me he was glad to be there to listen. I think part of me hoped he’d want to be my friend, even if it was because he liked me, because I was desperate for companionship.

Later, we went out for coffee, and he brought up my boyfriend again— I think because we had left our last conversation off with me crying about him and my late best friend. I ended up telling him about my relationship concerns. I admitted I was frustrated about not being engaged yet, and told him about the emotional distance and uncertainty I’d been feeling. I told him about some of my fears with my relationship etc. At the same time, I made sure to say, “But I love him and can’t let him go,” because that was always true. I never doubted that I wanted to stay with my boyfriend. Still, I think I subconsciously made my issues sound more dramatic, maybe to keep this guy’s interest as a friend or listener. But I never saw him as anything more. I have always done this even with my female friends. I used to like to stir the pot for a response (I know, toxic lowkey I’m not proud). I think this is where I fear if it was cheating or not. Because I wonder if me wanting him to have interest in me so he would want to be my friend is considered unfaithful. I never flirted with him or anything but if in my mind I was hoping he would have a little crush so he would want to be my friend more? Is that bad if I don’t directly say anything or flirt? Or is that just an intrusive thought?

I tried to set him up with my friends—both to make my intentions clear and maybe distract him if he did like me. But I also worried that if he started dating someone, I’d be alone again. It wasn’t jealousy, just fear of isolation. He paid for my coffee, wiped spilled coffee off my hand, and offered me his jacket—but I made sure not to wear it, as that felt like something too intimate.

Eventually, I told my boyfriend everything. I had looked up whether having a guy friend was wrong, and most said keeping it a secret was. I didn’t want to hurt him, and I loved him. As soon as I told him, I cut off contact with the guy. I felt bad but he knew my boyfriend didn’t like me talking to guy friends as he knew about my deceased friend so I think he understood.

Since then, I’ve been tormented by guilt. I’ve wondered daily if what I did was cheating—even though I never flirted, never wanted him, and never imagined being with him. I thought I was keeping things respectful and honest. But now, I constantly fear that I crossed a line I didn’t mean to.

This happened almost two years ago. I have not been able to let it go with fear that I cheated. I take cheating very seriously and also have really bad moral OCD that has been diagnosed so I don’t know if it is that or if my fears are true. Thanks so much!!!

Alright, friends, let’s get real for a second. When you’re 25, retirement feels like it’s a million years away, right? Like who even wants to think about life when the gray hairs start coming in? But here’s the kicker: the sooner you start saving, the easier it gets. Think of it like planting a tree; the earlier you plant it, the more shade you’ll have when you’re chilling on the porch with your favorite drink.

So, how much should you actually set aside each month? Let’s break it down:

### The Sweet Spot:
- **Aim for 15%**: If you can consistently save 15% of your income, you’re setting yourself up for some solid financial freedom. This includes any employer matches—so don’t leave that free money on the table!
  
### The Power of Compound Interest:
- **Time is your best friend**: Imagine each dollar you save is like a baby plant growing into a giant money tree. With compound interest working its magic, those early years of saving can make a HUGE difference. A little now means a lot later!

### Real-Life Math Time:
- If you’re making $50,000 a year and save 15%, that’s **$625** a month. Sounds intimidating? Let’s think about it this way:
  - **Daily Coffee Runs**: Cut out a couple of those overpriced lattes (I’m looking at you, pumpkin spice) and boom, you’re almost there!
  - **Side Hustle**: Got a hobby? Turn it into cash! Babysit, freelance, or sell some stuff online. 

### What Could This Look Like?
- **30s and Beyond**: If you start saving 15% at 25, by the time you hit 65, you could have a nest egg of nearly **$1.4 million**. I mean, who wouldn’t wanna be the cool retiree traveling the world?

### Keep It Real:
But hey, savings aren’t one-size-fits-all. Some of you might be thinking, “That’s great, but my rent is sky-high!” Totally get that. Here are some variations:
- **Start Small**: Even if you can’t hit 15% right away, just start somewhere. 5%? 10%? Awesome!
- **Increase as You Go**: Whenever you get a raise, bump up your savings percentage. You won’t even feel the pinch.

### Staying on Track:
- **Budget**: Just like meal prep for the week, budgeting helps you figure out where your money is going. 
- **Check-In Regularly**: Life changes, so reassess every few months to see if you can save more.

So there you have it! While it might seem far off, even small steps today can lead to that dream retirement tomorrow. And who knows? By saving smart now, you might free yourself up to travel, pursue hobbies, or just kick back enjoying life later.

What’s your take? Are you already on the savings train, or is it time to hop onboard?",1,1746160537.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False
1kcsjrz,https://i.redd.it/ki4s4jzlraye1.png,Great story for you,"Redemption in Blood and Dust

Prologue – The End Begins in the Dust

The desert sun scorched the cracked ground as four horsemen crossed the expanse. They were known as the Gang of the Four Winds: Wody, the swift and calculating gunslinger; Grek, the brute who solved everything with his fists; Ironfels, the former sheriff turned outlaw; and Porths, the silent strategist who preferred the knife to the gun.

They left nothing behind — banks, trains, merchants... Nothing was safe when the Four Winds blew. Each city they passed through was marked by blood and fear. But it wasn't always like that.

Wody, the leader, has always been different. He had something deep in his eyes that others didn't have — sadness... and hope.


---

Chapter 1 – The Big Coup

The town of Drybell was small but wealthy. A new bank had opened, full of gold from the frontier mines. It was the perfect target.

— ""We entered quickly, we left even faster. No heroes, no witnesses."" — said Porths, as he drew up the plan on an old wooden table, in the tavern lit by dirty lamps.

Wody looked out the window. At the counter across the street stood Eliza—the town pastor's daughter, serving coffee to the outsiders. Her brown hair shone even in the desert dust, and her eyes were like the sky before the storm.

Wody looked away, hardening his heart. Deep down, he knew that the life he led separated him from any hope of peace. But something about that woman gave him a pang of regret.

The coup was a success... almost.

While they were collecting the gold, a young sheriff, full of courage and little sense, tried to stop them. In the ensuing shootout, Grek killed the boy without thinking twice.

The city was in mourning. And Wody... Wody felt something break inside him.


---

Chapter 2 – Hunted like Wolves

The sheriff's death put the entire region behind the gang. Bounty hunters, mercenary armies and even local militias.

As they fled to the mountains, the first frictions arose:

— ""You hesitated, Wody!"" — Grek roared, punching a tree. — ""It would have cost us everything!""

— ""We weren't supposed to kill anyone..."" — replied Wody with a dark look.

Ironfels just smoked his cigar, watching. He knew that gangs don't break on the outside—they break on the inside.

And through it all, Wody dreamed. I dreamed of Eliza, of a different life. With redemption.


---

Chapter 3 – The Porths Plan

Worn out, the gang needed one last blow to disappear forever.

Porths proposed robbing the Union Pacific train loaded with weapons and money.

— ""With that, we crossed the border and became ghosts.""

But Wody hesitated. The guilt and weight of past actions weighed more and more.

Before the coup, Wody secretly rode to Drybell. At night, he found Eliza in the small church lit by candles.

— ""You should be far away from here..."" — she said, fearing and loving that man at the same time.

Wody knelt before the altar, his hat clutched to his chest.

— ""I don't want to be who I am. But I don't know how to change.""

Eliza cried, touching her blood-stained hand.

— ""No one changes alone, Wody. God can change you.""

That night planted the seed of change... but hell still had one last dance.


---

Chapter 4 – The Betrayal of Porths

During the train robbery, everything seemed perfect — until Porths betrayed the group.

He had made a deal with the Pinkertons: he would hand over Wody, Grek and Ironfels in exchange for amnesty and half the gold.

Amid the hail of bullets, Porths shot Ironfels in the back, knocking the old ex-sheriff down. Grek, furious, killed two agents before being seriously shot.

Wody managed to escape, carrying Ironfels on his shoulders, but the old man was dying.

— ""Go, boy... Save yourself... Do something good..."" — were his last words.

Wody buried Ironfels under a sycamore tree and swore: he would never kill for money again.


---

Chapter 5 – Redemption in Fire

With Grek captured and Porths leading a manhunt to kill him, Wody fled to Drybell, seeking refuge with Eliza.

There, he decided to turn himself in to the authorities, to pay for his crimes and try to stop Porths from massacring the city to hunt him down.

On the eve of the final battle, he and Eliza shared their first kiss under the starry sky.

— ""If I die tomorrow... know that you saved my soul."" —he whispered.

The final fight was brutal.

Porths and his men invaded Drybell, but Wody, together with the citizens, defended the city with courage.

In the final duel, before the church, Wody faced Porths.

When he had the chance to kill him, Wody lowered the revolver.

— ""It's over, Porths. You don't boss me around anymore.""

Porths fired—but before he could hit, he was shot down by Eliza, who fired to save Wody.

The city survived.


---

Epilogue – The New Dawn

Wody was arrested... but over the years, his sentence was reduced thanks to Drybell's testimony.

When he left prison, he found Eliza waiting for him, as he had promised.

They were married in the old Drybell church.

Wody became a humble farmer, teaching children to read, preaching peace, and always remembering that even the worst of men can be saved.

On the tombstone in the cemetery where he buried his old companions, Wody had the following engraved:

I’m so proud that I found a diet and routine that works for me recently. I’ve worked so hard to lose it all. I can’t wait to get under 200. 

My general exercise routine:
- I get 15K steps a day. 
- I lift 3 days a week for about 1.5 hours that includes some abs. 
- I do HIIT and stairmaster for 30min the other 2. 
- Saturdays I swim for 45min to an hour. I also run/walk 6 miles 
- Sundays are stretching and massaging my muscles before and after a 30 min run. 

I want to call out that I have a gym in my building for morning cardio. I go to a nearby gym to get out of the house in order to for myself stay longer. 

Diet:
- 120g of protein in the form of shakes/yogurt/bars
- Low cal soups and frozen meals
- tons of fruit as snacks before/after a meal 
- one snack is low cal bread and PB powder mixed with 0 cal hazelnut coffee creamer
- dinner (varies)
— options are typically veggie-heavy chicken tacos OR a low cal salad with tuna
— if I eat out, I plan and cut back to save my calories

I don’t do intermittent fasting nor count my calories. But I brush my teeth after dinner as a way of being “done” for the day. If I snack afterwards I just use mouthwash cause it’s typically yogurt and jam. 

Other random things that help:

- I only have coffee creamer or lattes on weekends. 
- staying hydrated as much as possible
- nothing fried, except on 1 day a week of if I eat out. 
- cutting back caffeine (this was hard)
— none after 2pm the day before a weekday
— none after 4pm the day before a weekend
- “treating myself” mentality to binge eating healthy snacks like fruit or hummus and carrots on weekends. 
- pre portioning just about everything I eat during the week days

I work in a cafeteria and I'm in charge of the grab and go salad bar (self serve ect). My coworker who's an older person in her 60s is in charge of serving coffee and such and likes to eat healthy so she always has the salad bar. On our lunch break she was having a bowl of salad and she stated  that she heard a loud crunch when she bit down on the bite of salad. She spit out her food and didn't see any Forgien items in the salad (I told my supervisor and we checked the salad before  the main rush and we didn't find any forgein objects or anything out of the ordinary so it was okay) so my coworker deemed that it could of been the croutons since there crunchy or the seeds in her salad. 

Later on she went into the washroom and stated to me that she can see a tiny chip on one of her back teeth and she said ""guess I'm calling the dentist tomorrow"" she also wondered if she can get wsib to cover the dentist price since it did happen at work (we have dental insurance btw) I'm not too worried about it but I could hear her talking about how it's my fault that she chipped her tooth cause the croutons are too crunchy and among other things. There wasn't anything wrong with the salad bar though(no complaints or issues from the actual associates we cater too everyday) and my supervisor told me she would let our superiors know that we checked the salad bar and nothing was dangerous with it if my coworker decided to bring it up, but I'm just wondering could my supervisor sue me if she decided to go that route? 

Like there's no evidence of the salad bar being tainted or foreign objects in it so i don't know what grounds my coworker would have? Ik that wsib will still possibly provide support for the dental visit to fix her tooth but does she have power to sue me with out evidence?

I know it kind of defeats half the purpose of a superauto, but does anyone use the pre-ground chute this way, and is it better than using the built-in grinder?",1,1746159869.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False
1kcsduk,https://i.redd.it/9aw8i2aspaye1.jpeg,I think I might have dodged a bad situation ...... Or perhaps I'm being a bit paranoid .,"Yesterday I was walking through the park near Pham Ngu Lao . I found myself chatting to a gentleman from the Philippines.
  We went and had a coffee and after some conversation he told me that his daughter who was 27 and a nurse was going to be moving to Australia (my country) . 
   He was inquiring about her safety in Australia and what she should expect. I shared some information with him and then he mentioned that his mother was in his Vietnam staying with his brother and is Brothers Vietnamese wife. He said that his mother was extremely concerned about her granddaughter ( his daughter)  because she'd heard that there was a lot of racial discrimination in Australia. 
    He then asked me if we could meet up the next day at the coffee shop we end up chatting in  (today) and if I would come with him in a taxi  to meet his mother to assure her that everything would be okay. I said no problem and we arranged to meet up. 
    When I got home I started thinking a little bit more and this morning sent him the above message,  you can see his reply. 
   Perhaps he is genuine perhaps he is  not. But I thought it would be a good idea to share it with this community to let people know and help people be a little more aware of potential scams.   
I'm Interested to get some feedback .  Has anybody had anything like this happen to them ?

The story has killed it for me. I am a F2P person, so my opinion doesn’t carry as much weight, but it matters a little. 

They ruined the experience for me. It went from cozy, and wonderful, to something I don’t understand. It’s a completely different game now and I hate it. 

I wanted those houses in Miraland to be opened up. Those are the places we could “live.” Maybe some coffee shops or other things that are warm and relaxing. 

There is SO much they could have done in Miraland. I expected the 1.5 update to include opening up Umbraso. You can see through the gate. There is a nice bridge there. So much could have been done with the original storyline but now it is absolutely ruined. I honestly don’t know if they can fix this. 

My play time will go from high to zero. I just can’t do it. Miraland and Nikki’s backstory are all I care about. 

I think the odds of Infold changing things, for those of us complaining, is near zero. I’m sad.

when i filled out my medical health history, i noted my hypertension.  i've never had it come up at the dentist's before, but the hygienist actually took my blood pressure and it was really high.  took a while before the doctor showed up and in the mean time, this hygienist (lovely lady) was asking a few more teeth-related questions.  she asked if i drink tea or coffee and my caffeinated ass was like 'oh, i'll take a coffee' not realizing she wasn't offering, but asking because of the colour of my teeth. 

i'm a student nurse and doing my consolidation this summer so i'm almost ready to practice (at a novice level).  when i asked if i had anything show up on the x-ray, the hygienist told me she couldn't say and i'd have to wait for the doctor.  if i weren't in health care, that might have worried me, but since i am, i realize it's not because there's something weird and the doctor needs to look it over, it's really a sort of legal 'scope of practice' thing.  as a nurse, i can't deliver any diagnoses even if there's nothing serious or abnormal, it's just not within my scope.  understanding that, we just waited for the doctor.  

when the doctor showed up, he took a look at my stuff and said i had a few really tiny cavities he wasn't worried about and that my blood pressure was too high to do anything anyway.  i mean, for a cleaning that's kind of weird and i've never gotten that before but, overall i'm actually sort of glad a doctor made that call.  it's time to bite the bullet, realize i haven't been able to manage my blood pressure properly and just get a fucking pill so i don't have a heart attack or develop kidney disease.

walking home, it was really really nice out.  i passed this coloured guy who was kind of cute and, you know, looked him over.  the way he looked back made me almost burst out laughing once i passed him because *he. was. interested*. and it was almost scandalous.  later on i got a coffee at a tim horton's and this guy standing next to me must have been, like, 6'7"" *easily* and the tallest person i've seen in recent memory.

1kcsarm,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_IcePsychological8016/comments/1kcsarm/i_think_my_friend_is_obsessed_with_me/,I think My Friend is Obsessed with me.,"(Im sorry this is so long, but I seriously don't know what to do, please help.) 

I (16F) met my friend (17M) at a private Christian school this year. I recently had some mental issues, so my parents sent me to a Private Christian school in my town, hoping that the socialization and the ""advanced"" learning might help my mental state. And it did at first. I instantly made friends and got along with all my classmates. Soon, I got paired with a guy who I will call S, and we instantly got along and soon became friends. Unfortunately, though, soon I realized he thought of me as more than just a friend, but because I wasn't sure how I felt in return, I just played dumb and pretended to be oblivious to his obvious signs that he liked me. At first, he did really sweet things like give me some little cookies or Little Debbie's cakes at lunch, always making sure to open doors for me,  pulling out my chair for me, always checking in on how I was feeling, and he even walked me out to my car at pick up. He was a total gentleman and a really good guy, and honestly, I was starting to debate my feelings in my head. And because I felt bad that he was doing all this for me and I had done nothing for him, I would always draw pictures for him, and occasionally bring him some coffee I made from home. He soon found this as a sign and then started to get bolder (He would ALWAYS be touching me in some way like our arms always touching, and our legs always touching when we sat down, or poking me.) This started to make me feel a bit uncomfortable, but I was still contemplating whether or not I liked him. Soon, my friends, his friends, and even the teachers started to ship us, and I would just pretend like I knew nothing in hopes that it would die down. It did not.

I started to get extremely uncomfortable and soon talked to my friend who I will call N. I told N I was uncomfortable with S, and I thought of him as just a friend. She listened to me and said she would help me with S and admitted that she was trying to help S get with me because she knew he liked me and thought I liked him. Soon she began to sit between me and S, since I told her he was getting too close, but I noticed him getting mad and sad about it. He eventually started to move her stuff to the next seat over. If she left the room just to sit by me, or he would move chairs to the corner of the table and try to squeeze himself close to me. I never confronted him or told him to stop because he previously told me about his mental issues, and that I made him feel safer and that he could trust me, and I started to feel guilty about this. Teachers would pull me after class just to talk to me about him and how much I have changed him. Apparently, before, he would rarely talk in class, never make eye contact, shut down during lessons, and never volunteer to do anything. And they would tell me that I had a huge impact on him, and they noticed him opening up more, getting his grades up, talking and joking around with the other students, and starting to volunteer to help teachers and everyone around him. Because the teachers told me this, I felt like I needed to help him.  So, I told N that it was ok now and that I now felt comfortable around him, even though I actually still didn't.

Turns out that was a terrible move, and stuff got worse. S got even bolder with his moves and started to put his arm around me when we were sitting (I always leaned forward with my hands on my knees to avoid contact.) He even started to occasionally call me honey or babe, which made me cringe inside. He also would openly talk about wanting to take me to all these places that I knew he intended as a date (I would just laugh it off, and to every single one I would say ""Yeah, like a FREIND hangout."" or something like that) Because I noticed he was trying to make advances I always made sure to say things that implied I thought of him as a friend like: ""Your such a good friend to me"" ""I see you as a brother"" and I would even talk about not wanting to date anyone and wanting to focus on schoolwork, and I told him my parents didn't allow me to date, and even told him I was a Lesbian at one point in hopes he would back off. He never did. Eventually, I felt so uncomfortable I would walk around with a sharpened pencil with the intention of stabbing him if he tried any advanced on me. And once thought thinks couldn't get worse, they did.

Soon S's friend B came up to me and straight up asked me if I liked S or not. I was so overwhelmed and confused with everything, so I just told him that ""I wasn't sure and wasn't really thinking about it because I wasn't allowed to date anyway"". And then a look of what I assumed to me relief or something washed over his face and he said ""ok good because he is honestly freaking me out a bit. anytime we call he is only talking about you. You are the only thing he is talking about and I'm starting to get worried"" but before b could say anything else S came up from around the corner and they both looked at each other for a second then we all walked to class in silence. I was a bit freaked out by what B said and the next day, I noticed B staring at me and S the whole time. I don't know for sure, but to me he kind of looked nervous. It could all be in my head because I was so shaken up and overwhelmed by everything that was going on. That very same night when I was about to go to bed I got a text from N saying ""S is staring to scare me look at what the fuck he just said to me."" And sent me a screen shot of their conversation.

S started off by asking her, ""Hey, do you think (my name) would wear a bunny suit?"" N responded with ""What type of bunny suit are you talking about?"" and S sent her to a link of a Langire bunny suit set.

Now I understand he is a teenage boy who likes me, and yeah, I know they are gonna have their weird fantasies, but the fact he texted this and sent a LINK to the Langire set to MY friend was really off-putting and freaked me out. She then sent me previous texts of him ranting on about how I'm like coke to him, and she told him he needed to stop and, like, take a break to calm the hell down, but he refused and continued to rant on. She sent me over 20 screen shots of him ranting on about me and his fantasies with me that included picking me up, taking me out, having sex with me, foreplay fantasies and clothes he thinks would look good on me (shocker most of them would show a generous amount of my cleavage and thighs since I'm a curvy girl.)

I remember crying myself to sleep that night. I went back to school the next morning and told N to act normal and pretend she didn't tell me any of that, and that I didn't know. I told her this since the school year was coming to an end, and I just wanted to avoid conflict and hope it would just go away. I dint wanna confront him or anything because I knew he had problems with suicidal thoughts, and I know he has major depression, and as a person who struggled with a suicide attempt and self-harm harm I didn't want to throw him down the same road.  But I am now realizing that ignoring the problem is no better and that I am throwing myself deeper into this.

A few days ago,  S and I called because he needed help, and he decided to show me some of his cat pics on his phone so he screen recorded as he went through his photos and as he was searching for an older pic of his cat I noticed many pictures of me on his phone. All of these pics are at school, and no, I didn't know about a single one. This really creeped me out, and he realized his mistake and instantly got it out of his camera roll. I was freaked out and didn't know what to do, so I pretended not to notice, then shortly after, said I had to go and hung up.

But this encounter is one that Really freaks me out.

Today, I got home from school like normal, but my parents had to leave for something with my sister, so I was home alone. I was sitting in the living room watching some random stuff on my phone when I heard footsteps walking up my porch, then a loud knocking at my door. I was startled and quickly glanced out the window to see a red truck. Since I thought I didn't recognize it, I grabbed my sister's metal baseball bat and crept up to the door and looked through the peephole. And sure enough, S is standing there waiting for me to open the door. Since I was confused, I opened the door to confront him. Once I opened it, he smiled at me and explained that I had left my homework folder in my locker and handed it to me. He asked if he could go inside, but I told him I was alone and my parents wouldn't like it, so we stayed on the porch and talked for about three minutes before I finally mustered up the courage to ask him how he found my house. But once I asked, he smiled and put a finger up to his lips and hushed me, then walked off my porch and to his truck, then drove off.

Now I'm sure he was messing around and playing, and probably asked the school for it since none of my friends there know where I live. But the fact that he didn't tell me and just ran off freaks me out. Also, the fact that he knew I left my folder in my locker and drove all the way here just to give it to me, even though I'm going back to school tomorrow, since it's Thursday. I told my mom about him showing up and that I was a bit freaked out, but she said I was overreacting and that it was sweet of him to go all this way to give me my homework.

So, I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm overreacting, thinking he is unhealthily obsessed with me, but this type of thing hasn't happened to me before due to my being homeschooled most of my life, and I don't know what to do. I have three weeks left till summer break, and I'm honestly scared and don't know what to do in this situation. He himself is a good guy, and I don't want to ruin that. My parents are not easy to talk to and I feel like if I tell them this, they may get extremely angry at me. 

 Is he obsessed with me? Or is this just a normal crush thing? What do I do? please help. ",1,1746159536.0,u_IcePsychological8016,0,1.0,False
