1nn56by,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nn56by/i_24f_cheated_on_my_boyfriend_28m_but_he_doesnt/,"I (24F) cheated on my boyfriend (28M), but he doesn't resent me?","So, I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (28M) for a little over a year. He's the best boyfriend I've ever had by far, and I don't say that lightly. He literally treats me like a queen, I don't know where to start, but I've never experienced that before. 

He gives me hours long massages. When I mentioned im tired, he swings by after work to cook dinner just for me. If he sees my laundry basket full he just takes it and washes it at his place. He returns my library books when I finish them, my Zara articles, without me ever asking. Last time I mentioned I was stressed about taxes, he offered to help and ended up doing the whole thing for me. He comes by almost every week end to clean my apartment, like he just shows up with my favorite iced coffee and cleans my floors, kitchen, all of it while I relax. Anyway it would be too long to describe everything honestly, but you get the gist of it.  

A month and a half ago, I made a mistake. I went out for some drinks with some coworkers and ended up hooking up with a guy I met that night. No excuse, it just happened in the moment. I felt guilty so I told my boyfriend the next day. He cried, which honestly kind of broke me inside. I felt like the shittiest person in the world, I apologized so many times.

Eventually he said he forgave me.  I thanked him and  promised I'll make up for it. He said I don't need to do anything to make up for it, just promise not to do it again, which I obviously did. But I was determined to make up for it in other ways.

The next day I went to his place to cook for him. He thanked me but he said I don't need to. I said I I want to, but he really insisted and said he doesn't want what happened to alter the relationship, or for me to feel like I need to repay him. He just wanted things to go back to normal.

So now, we‚Äôre back to normal. We hang out, laugh, sleep together, watch movies, everything is the same. He isn't acting cold or distant, he still does everything for me, still treats me like royalty, and he hasn't brought it up again. Yesterday he came over and cleaned up like usual and made me quesadillas. He‚Äôs just being his perfect self again.

Im obviously very happy and relieved that I didn't lose him, but I need to have outside perspective on this. Like is this okay? Did he forgive me too easily? Is this just how some guys are?",1,1758492488.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

1nn55ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/1nn55ld/saed_on_a_date/,SAed on a date,"While I was studying abroad, I went on a date with a guy and we met at a park in London. There wasn‚Äôt a clear plan for the date; I had just told him by text that I wanted to get coffee instead of alcohol. Things started off normal, but about an hour in, when we were sitting on a bench, he started touching my thigh and then kissed me. I pulled away, and he said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to my place.‚Äù I said no. People were sitting near us, and I wondered if they had noticed.

After I said no, we continued talking normally, but then he started touching my thigh again and put his tongue in my ear, and said ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go. You don‚Äôt have to do anything, I just want to keep kissing you.‚Äù Part of me was physically aroused, which confuses me, but mentally I was uncomfortable and frozen the whole time.

I refused again and told him I just wanted to keep walking and take pictures. He took pictures of me like nothing had happened, but then grabbed and fondled my butt, saying I was distracting him. About ten minutes later, he suggested again, ‚ÄúMy place is behind that building over there. C‚Äômon, let‚Äôs go.‚Äù At that point, I didn‚Äôt really know how to get out of the situation because something like this had never happened to me before. I refused again, and the last thing he said was to go get a drink, which I declined. By the end of the hangout, I was very quiet and didn‚Äôt want to keep talking.

I only really remembered what happened when I read the texts I had sent my friends that day. When the date ended, I felt disappointed in myself for letting it happen and not telling him to stop, and confused because my body reacted in a way that my mind couldn‚Äôt comprehend. I pushed it to the back of my mind, thinking I was just overreacting. It‚Äôs been five months, and I never fully processed it until I got back home from my study abroad. I even remember washing my mouth in a public bathroom after he kissed me goodbye.

I thought nothing was going to happen and that I would be safe because I was in a public setting.",1,1758492436.0,sexualassault,1,0.99,False
1nn555i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1nn555i/i_saw_you/,I saw you.,"Unfortunately, for me. I saw your story. You looked...beautiful.

I made a rule for myself that for the next 30 days I won't interact with your story.  
But we talked this week. A month after you broke up with me. We had a really good conversation and you provided me closure I have been needing. I left the conversation feeling at peace. I've been feeling settled. My heart's sleeping. I've been giving others advice and hope of healing...look at me!  
Today, I was silently recognizing how relieved I was that hearing your voice didn't shoot me back into my retired obsession. We've even been sharing tiny spurts of conversation.

So I thought a harmless swipe would be fine. How bad could a photo of maybe your pets, a poem, even a sweet treat be? I'd actually really enjoy seeing what my friend is up to.

When I saw your face I stopped speaking mid sentence. You caught my breath. My heart woke up abruptly. You looked beautiful. I even went back later to look again. I felt an ache that was duller than before but feels like a distant friend.

I miss being in love with you, not anything that comes with it. I miss who I remember you as, not who you proved you are.  
I miss your skin and how you smell. Your smile. Your sounds. The weight of your hair. I miss watching you soften. I miss telling you how beautiful you are. I miss watching you speak and soaking you in. I miss stopping time to experience you a little longer. I miss watching you undress. I miss holding you when you sleep. I miss how your greetings were physical and silent. I miss watching you walk up to me. I miss that skipped breath every...single...time I saw you, like it was the first. I miss existing with you. I miss learning about you years in. I miss waking you up with kisses. I miss making coffee for you. I miss loving you.

I don't want the way we loved each other back...I hope one day we can love each other in a different way.

I will be gentle with this grief tonight and I will return to my rule.

he was my first boyfriend, my first heartbreak, my first kiss. he was so good while we lasted; he would randomly bring me food sa room namin kasi he knew na i dont eat breakfast, he would stay sa campus hours after his dismissal period kasi ang dami kong extra-curriculars just to make sure na i'll get home safe, would make only a portion of coffee jelly kasi i liked his cooking kaso he hates coffee. you know? typical high school puppy love.

not until he confessed na rebound niya lang pala ako. he never got over the girl he previously courted a year ago. and he would still go to his ex's house to have sex with her after we hang out sa house namin. he never loved me daw pero he tried. god knows he tried. kaso ang tanga ko kasi inalok ko pa siya na tutulungan ko siyang magmove on basta kami parin. everyone in our school witnessed how hard i begged him na balikan ako (i literally post on my story na nagmamakaawa üò≠) jusko. we were only together for 6 months pero i begged for months. i got over him after 3 years. 

looking back, i was so dumb and childish and na√Øve. so embarrassing. but that's life.

1nn54rm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1nn54rm/how_to_be_comfortable_being_alone_not_single_but/,"How to be comfortable being alone? (not single, but physically alone)","**TL;DR** I (33f) am just now realizing that I cannot, and never have been able to, stand being alone in a room for five seconds. This is absurd, and I would really appreciate some advice to help conquer it. Also if Dr K has made any relevant videos, I‚Äôd love to know.

\*

I grew up in a household with zero boundaries, zero privacy. Two narcissistic parents, one of whom would physically intrude and did not allow me to close doors right up until I left for college. The other wanted me to be his mini-me. So I guess I never learned how to be alone or do things ""just for me.""

In high school and college I *wanted* to be independent. I would grab all the alone time I could get: when my parents were out of the house, when my college roommate was out, even staying on campus alone during breaks. I was excited to be alone and do my own projects. But as soon as I actually *was* alone, I couldn‚Äôt focus, and wasted all my time on the internet. I didn‚Äôt know why at the time. Now I think it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm so uncomfortable being alone that I compulsively seek out (virtual) company. If I can‚Äôt feel another person‚Äôs presence, I need to hear another person‚Äôs voice or read other people‚Äôs comments.

I‚Äôm convinced that this is the root of my 20-year YT/social media/video game addiction. I *really* want to stop. In the past few years I‚Äôve quit games and social media (except this reddit account, which I barely use), even got rid of my smartphone. I want to quit YT too. But as long as I have a computer and internet access that‚Äôs a losing battle. I feel like I can‚Äôt live without it.

I got married two years ago. My wife is amazing. She knew I hated my old career and that I had a lifelong dream to write a novel, and she said go for it! She works full time while I do housewife duties and spend most of the day writing (or trying to). I‚Äôve actually managed to get 3/4 of the way through a second draft, and I think I‚Äôll be able to query soon. But the entire process has been a joyless slog, mostly with YT playing in the background (like 8 hrs a day), which distracts me as much as it comforts me. Writing at the coffee shop is better, but I can‚Äôt spend *all* day there, plus I‚Äôm trying to be frugal.

This should be something I love, and I feel like I‚Äôm ruining it for myself. It‚Äôs killing me that I‚Äôve wasted so much of my own time, and I know I‚Äôm going to waste more.

I have a therapist and she‚Äôs told me I‚Äôm codependent, but we‚Äôre mostly working on processing childhood trauma right now (so many issues, so little time ‚Ä¶). I would love some supplementary advice on this. Thanks in advance for anything you can offer.

I‚Äôm a 30-year-old male, diagnosed with **type-2 diabetes about a year ago**. I took metformin for 1 month after diagnosis, but have since managed to bring my **HbA1c down to 6.5 (from 10.7)** through a low-carb diet alone. I‚Äôm now trying to **gain muscle** but still want to keep blood sugar under control, which feels tricky at times.

**Stats:**

* **Height/Weight/BMI:** 5‚Äô8‚Äù, 127 lbs, BMI 19.5 (borderline underweight/normal)
* **Body Composition (DEXA):** \~23% body fat, visceral fat mass 0.16 lbs
* **Training:** Recently started weight training 4‚Äì5 days/week
* **Diet preference:** Mostly clean, minimally processed vegetarian foods

**Goal:** Increase muscle mass while maintaining healthy blood sugar.

# Current Diet (approx. protein per meal)

* Breakfast: Tofu scramble + soy milk coffee + Greek yogurt + berries with dry fruits & seeds (45‚Äì50g protein)
* Lunch: Salad bowl (tofu/paneer + legumes + ¬Ω avocado + veggies + nuts/seeds) (\~25g protein)
* Snacks: Edamame + almonds/cashews/pistachios (\~16g protein)
* Dinner (post-workout): 1 scoop whey protein + unsweetened nut butter (\~34g protein)

**Daily Totals:** \~132 g protein, \~91 g carbs, \~82 g fat, \~1650 kcal

# Questions

1. Is my current diet effective for muscle gain as a vegetarian, without negatively impacting blood sugar? Any improvements you‚Äôd suggest?
2. Are soy-based protein sources (tofu, whey protein, etc.) safe long-term for men?
3. Is taking 2 scoops of protein powder/day (with stevia or other artificial sweeteners) safe for long-term blood sugar and gut health?
4. Can I bulk on a high-protein, high-fat vegetarian diet safely with type-2 diabetes? Any long-term considerations?
5. Starting at \~23% body fat, what‚Äôs a realistic timeline to reach 15% body fat while gaining muscle, without impacting HbA1c?
6. For vegetarians with similar goals: How do you balance protein intake, muscle gain, and blood sugar control?

I‚Äôve done a lot of reading, but feel a bit stuck navigating muscle gain while keeping diabetes under control. Any advice, practical tips, or personal experiences would mean a lot! üôè

1nn51r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1nn51r9/am_i_overreacting_different_cultures_dating/,Am I overreacting ? Different cultures dating,"So basically I'm arab Muslim women
I met this Sweet American guys who recently become muslim he really want to talk so I presented my version of dating we usually meet with the Intention of marriage, we don't date as in no touching or intimacy moving in without marriage. We date by spending time getting to know the person talking doing activities together until we are sure this is the right person we involve the family from the beginning by informing the mother about that there is a person intrested and then when we are sure things has to be offical or we simply tell the person its not going to work.
This guy is very nice he agreed to all of this. 

But everytime I meet him I learn something that for me would be a big red flag but for him it would be okay because we come from totally different cultures
I want to talk about these things to understand where is the middle line and how is it really in American culture.
In my culture men open the door, when walk they alway walk next to you they never let you walk on the street side, never let you pay for food when they're around, never walk and let you follow them basically they act like your protecter and a gentleman*  and I understand this might be considered old culture in the U.S so this guy noticed he's not practicing those things and he started doing few of these things and I appreciated this alot then he was very honest and told me on the 3 date that in American culture it means it's official if you meet the person for the 3rd time and he brought roses and chocolate  where for me it's not not necessarily because I thought 3rd time it not enough to make anything official. After the 4th date he confessed that he recently broke up after 6 years long relationship with his girlfriend he intended to marry and the reason is they no longer had anything in common he's muslim she ethiest and etc I got scared because I thought I must be the one he want to use to get over his breakup üòÜ then he said in the last 3 months he hang with her 2 twice and if I want him to stop meeting her he would and he only did that because she asked him and he didn't want to be mean and she means nothing in his life right now. I appreciated the honestly but I freaked out and I said where i come from you don't become friends or hang out with the person you just broke up with however I didn't want to be the controlling person when I just met the guys I simply told him it sound wrong to me and I wouldn't be comfortable talking to a person knowing they still in contact with thier ex. The guy apologised and told me he will stop all contacts and that there is nothing to worry about. 5th time we met for coffee I told him I deciced we need to slow down meet less maybe and just take time since he just went out of a long relationship and im new here He said he doesn't want to he feels so happy now that he is talking to me and how lonely it was for him since he became Muslims then he throw this bomb and told me he didn't tell his family about him converting to Islam and I don't know how that works in his culture, hes a grown up but like shouldnt his family know ? and I felt very bad because this guy is at a point where he is changing his whole identity yet he is looking for someone and I just decided ill keep talk to him but with less interest becuase I feel like he has so much going on and it's very difficult for me sometimes to understand the dating culture in the U.S and he needs time but be doesn't see it. 
I know this group is like for dating and not for muslims but that not the point im posting here üôÑ   I need to get the American perspective on this since the guy is American to me he is honest and serious. 
Also I have to say I'm surprised by American men they're very soft I felt like i have to act up everytime and that was weird to me are all guys here like this ? ",2,1758492163.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

1nn4ymk,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/1nn4ymk/the_baby_boomer_generation_seems_to_be_out_of/,"The Baby Boomer Generation seems to be out of touch with reality.  I am curious if people share this experience, but at any rate, this seems to be my assessment.","It's hard to generalize.  That's really why I want to ask what has your experience been with this generation.  We all have our own experiences, our own families etc.

I know I'm bias. My parents are Baby Boomers.  My grandparents are of the WWII Generation.

But I'm not just going by my parents.  I'm going for many Baby Boomers I know, met, interacted with.

I was talking with one Baby Boomer the other day, who interjected herself into the conversation on housing costs.  I wanted to get some stories from people who were struggling.  I heard more people than before are living out of their cars.  And this lady jumps in to tell us all that she has none of these problems and she just watches her money.  She said she used to eat out more but now eats out less because it's gotten expensive and she sees young people deciding to spend on Starbucks and restaurants and other things, to prioritize that instead of home ownership... it's like out of a cartoon.  Really?  Or out of a stereotype.  Yeah, we can all watch our spending, but I don't think Baby Boomer in their 20s and 30s just sat there doing nothing, not spending a penny.  And coffee doesn't add up to a million dollar house or 700k apartment (the cost in many places).

Some things are totally NOT their fault.  Yes, they bought a house decades ago when it matched local salaries a bit more, and now those houses are worth tons of money and they hold a lot of the wealth as a generation, but they didn't create the entire economy that made this happen.  So I don't want to blame them so much.

But where they seem to be worthy of some blame is the ignorance and the condescending attitude many seem to hold.  It's one thing to say you were smart and bought property, but it's another to assume everyone else is stupid who is less financially well off.  A lot is out of one's control.  It's not excuses, it's not being the victim.  It's reality.

They do seem out of touch.  They act like the job market and housing market is still like when they were starting work in the 70s or something.

And they also have a very strange attitude of not helping others.  Where did they get that?!?!  My parents don't even think they should help if someone has a life changing medical issue, or is homeless etc.  I get not just spoiling your children.  But if your adult child has a real serious issue that hit them early in life, you can't help with that even?  So it's very strange.  They hold onto their money, but I don't think the WWII generation was as individualistic.  So where did they get that mentality from?  To not give the next generation a helping hand?  Why?  It's more important to stick to their ""this is mine"" mentality than help their own family or things like that?

They also seem very much control freaks.  Again, maybe it's just because they have a lot of the control.  When they were younger, they didn't necessarily need much financial help because jobs paid enough where you could buy a house with a yard.  Now, their adult children are dependent on them to get a house in most cases, so they have a lot of power they can throw around or even abuse.  So they were fairly independent - or able to be - when younger and had that power and now they still have that power when older since those in their 20s, even 30s now, are getting the raw end of the stick with the economy in many ways.

They seem to want to control the narrative too.  From my experience, they want to say what their parents generation was.  They have actually blocked me from interviewing the WWII generation in the past.  They seem controlling to their elderly parents, or were, and they are also controlling to their adult children - well into adulthood too, or try to be.

They are so pushy with their views, which are often not working for society, not anymore at least.  But they stick to them, despite the bad way things are going.  They don't want to adjust.  They don't want to listen.  It's their way or the highway.  It's just very closed, very selfish it seems.  It's bizarre.  And they wonder if they don't have the best relationships with their adult children sometimes.

At least this seems to have been my experience.  I don't know why that generation became this way.  It doesn't seem like their parents generation is that way.  Maybe TV - they are the first TV generation I think.  But still, you think into old age, you could start to wake up a bit more, and not be a fool?  A fool is one thing, but an old fool is worse, no?",3,1758491949.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,5,0.8,False

I register as Shimmer LLC

Do I need a DBA to market as Shimmer coffee when making drinks or selling online. Or is coffee a descriptive word since shimmer is still my business name. 

I would also sign all of important paperwork with the LLC but was told I can drop the LLC on socials, marketing materials and website.

My plan was to register as just shimmer so if I wanted to launch shimmer tea or shimmer clothing etc later they'd all be part of the same main brand.

I'd like to report back on a recent trip our founder, Annie, took to Portugal. Her and her family had the most amazing time, and I thought this could be useful for those interested in visiting Portugal. Here is what she had to say:

""My husband was taking a class for his MBA in Lisbon, so we decided to bring our family to Portugal for 5 days prior to its start. We had heard it was a beautiful, historic city, with interesting cities/towns to easily see and visit nearby.

We drove one hour from the Lisbon airport to Sintra, a town northwest of Lisbon. We arrived late evening, so we decided to stay in after a long day of travel. Sintra is a historic town with estates and castles to tour. You could walk everywhere (it‚Äôs very hilly) and see so much without needing transportation. We stayed at a bed and breakfast called¬†Chalet Saudade‚Äìwe absolutely loved it.

Breakfast, included in our stay, was across the street at a charming caf√©. They delivered our breakfast to our table, full of croissants, hard-boiled eggs, fruit, fresh juices & coffee. A perfect start to our day of walking this historic small city. We visited the gorgeous¬†Pena Palace,¬†Castelo dos Mouros¬†(the top of Sintra, spectacular views), and the¬†Quinta de Regalia, a lavish estate set atop a hill. All three of these stops are a must, and we visit them all in one day! We loved Sintra‚Ä¶my absolute favorite stop of the trip!!

We stopped in Cascais, a coastal town with little shops and restaurants, for lunch and the afternoon on our way to Lisbon. In Lisbon, we stayed at the Torel Palace, a stylish boutique hotel perched above a section of the city. The location was fantastic, just footsteps to one of the famous yellow trams of Lisbon. When we arrived after a long day of driving, we were greeted with hospitality by the staff, soaking in gorgeous city/sunset views from their terrace and enjoying a light dinner while waiting for our room to be ready. If you stay here, I would recommend staying in one of the main converted pink or blue 19th-century mansions, which are considered the main part of the hotel. We were placed in an adjacent property, an apartment that didn‚Äôt seem too bad until 1 AM, when their night had just started.

Lisbon was fantastic; a bustling, hilly city with beautiful architecture and sites around every corner. We visited the¬†Torre de Belem¬†(an ancient port-side cavernous fortress), a bit of a wait but worth it. Also many hidden little pedestrian streets with cafes within the Alfama district‚Ä¶absolutely wonderful!! We loved riding the trams that run up steep winding cobblestone streets throughout the city. We lunched at an outdoor cafe in Alfama, which I cannot remember. You will find numerous outdoor cafes to enjoy in the area!""

Portugal is definitely on my list of European countries to visit!! As mentioned, Annie and her family had an amazing vacation, and would recommend visiting Portugal to anyone who is interested or on the fence.

I guess it would be a good idea to start by introducing myself? I don't know, I'm fairly new to these kinds of pages.  
  
My name‚Äôs Mike (Short for Micycle... if Mom hadn't stopped Dad) and I am your very traditional screw-up. I‚Äôm a normal dude by most accounts. I work an average job as a small-time writer at my local newspaper and live in... wait, the rules did say to stay away from identifiable information, so maybe let's not go around divulging where I live? Well... you just need to know that, just like the town I live in, my life was pretty beige‚Ä¶ or at least... it used to be until last year.

It‚Äôs been almost exactly a year since everything changed, so I figured I‚Äôd share my experiences here in hopes that, if you were to find yourself in a similar situation, you may be able to avoid making the same mistakes‚Ä¶ or so I call them, but I‚Äôm not too sure I would do things differently if given the chance.

But, anyway‚Ä¶ It all began on Halloween night, 2024.

A friend of mine (let‚Äôs call him Bob), invited me to a pub crawl organized by some local places. 

Have you ever been on one? You basically pay a fee and then spend the whole night going from bar to bar drinking like you have something to prove. It wasn‚Äôt a good idea. I don‚Äôt even like getting wasted, shit, I‚Äôm *terrible* with alcohol. But life had been boring and, well, Bob‚Äôs fun to be around, so I thought, *hey, maybe just one night*.

A part of me still wonders how things would have changed if I had just stayed home and watched a bad horror movie instead.

By three in the morning, we were on our fourth or fifth stop. I was more than a little past my bedtime, so I parked myself at the counter and asked for a shot of tequila. The bartender gave me the look you give a toddler reaching for a power outlet, then handed me something that tasted like pure regret.

That‚Äôs when I saw her there, standing by a speaker.

She mixed well with the other party-goers, dressed as she was, but her long, brown dress, wide hat and long gloves didn‚Äôt actually look like a costume, it looked like she had been ready to go to a Gala of some sort but had ended up in this dingy pub. 

Under the dim pub lights, she looked stunning, the kind of stunning that makes you forget your own name.

For all means, I‚Äôm average looking. I have a permanent stubble that grows back the minute I try to shave, messy brown hair that doesn‚Äôt want to sit in one shape for longer than a minute (Some friends and colleagues have said it sometimes looks like it moves on its own) and the bags under my eyes make me look like I sleep three hours a week (Which with my work schedule is sometimes sadly true), so by any means, that woman was waaaay outside of my league.

But to my inebriated mind, not trying to, at least, talk to her would have been a waste.

I don‚Äôt remember much, really. Just a flash of her smile and the sound of her laugh somehow reaching my ears beneath all the music, to my eyes, she looked amused. Now that I look back at it, I remember thinking it was strange no one else had tried talking to her before.

I remember taking her hand as we moved across the dancefloor together, her fingers cold in mine, and then I remember walking out of the pub with her in tow.

I remember thinking of calling for a cab, but given that I lived relatively close to the pub, I guessed the cold air might help to sober me up.

Next thing I know, it‚Äôs morning.

I woke up in my apartment, head pounding. The bed was a mess, like I‚Äôd collapsed into it fully clothed, but I had no memory of getting there. No memory of‚Ä¶ well, anything after leaving the pub.

Then Bob called.

‚ÄúDude, you left alone last night,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, no. I didn‚Äôt leave alone,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure I left with someone.‚Äù

‚ÄúNope, pretty sure I saw you talking to a wall for, like, half an hour. Dude, you were *gone* gone. I had to pay your tab, by the way. You can pay me back later.‚Äù

That‚Äôs when I heard it, the sound of my coffee maker starting up.

I told Bob I would call him later and walked towards my door, sure that on my kitchen I would see that he had been mistaken, that I had, in fact, left the pub with that lady.

And I saw her, sure‚Ä¶ but just for a split second. She looked as good as the night before, but under my apartment‚Äôs lights her dress didn‚Äôt look as brown as it looked sepia, like taken from some faded old photograph.

And her eyes? I only saw two embers looking back at me under the shade of her wide hat.

For that split second I saw her smile a smile that was a bit too wide for comfort, and then‚Ä¶ she was gone‚Ä¶

The pot sputtered and hissed while I was stood there, too stunned to move, until the kitchen smelled faintly of freshly made coffee.

Did you know ghosts can interact with some machinery? I didn‚Äôt. Turns out the lady from the bar knows how to use my coffee machine‚Ä¶ just not very well. Her coffee always comes out tasting a little ashy.

I still drink it. It feels... rude not to.",2,1758491609.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Here's everything I can remember that now only exists in memories. What are your memories of the West End in the 80s and 90s?

**Davie and Denman**

* The 2-floor **McDonald's** across from The Bayside Lounge. They had a life-size model of Mac Tonight playing a piano on the upper floor, which scared the crap out of me as a child. Then there was a fire inside overnight and it never re-opened.
* There was a **Cookies By George** on the corner here in the 80s, wasn't there?

**Davie and Bidwell/Cardero**

* The original **Safeway** and the **Super Valu** that was across the street (which is now the London Drugs). I don't remember much about this Super Valu since it closed in the late 80s, but the Safeway I could draw a map of the layout I remember it so vividly. I also have a vague memory of the owner of this Super Valu getting robbed or something shady going on related to the business.
* The 2-floor **Rogers Video**. If Mega Movies up the street didn't have something, you could always walk down the street to see if it was available here instead. Now both the building and the parking lot next to it are a condo tower.

**Davie and Jervis**

* **Mega Movies**. As a kid, this was the greatest video store I'd ever been to. You could look in the window and see the Nintendo shelf from the street, which was handy because some games would never be in when you'd go. Eventually became a 2nd Rogers Video and now it's split between a community policing center and a retail store.
* Another **Super Valu** next to Mega Movies. This one is still essentially the same today, just a different brand (Independent) and different layout (no more arcade games by the exit doors either).

**Davie and Bute/Thurlow**

* **Aquariums West** (now a salon/restaurant) next to the Mac's (now a Circle K). They later moved to 796 Beatty St. They used to have a resident Macaw that would hang out near the register.
* The giant **KFC** bucket above the store that apparently used to spin around (according to childhood rumors). Did it ever?
* **Fresgo Inn**. A solid price/value combo for large amount of cheap average quality food any time of day.

**Davie and Thurlow/Burrard**

* The coin-op laundromats that used to be on each side of the street (one next to the Denny's, the other across from it). I have an early memory of being in the one next to the Denny's and a small TV playing Alien Nation for everyone to watch while they waited for their laundry to finish.
* The **Book Warehouse** in the middle of the block, back when discount book stores were a thing.
* **Gigi's**. I remember the one across the bridge better than this one, but I remember it being a decent pasta place. I also remember after it was permanently closed down, a dirty serving tray was left by the window and the spectacle of flies and filth gradually increasing as I'd walk by daily.

**Davie and Burrard**

* The time when there were twin gas stations on each corner (one is now a community garden). There was also a **Quizno's** in this nook during the 90s before it was all demolished.

**Burrard and Smithe**

* The other **Denny's** (now Spence Diamonds). There was a time you could choose between 2 Denny's locations, and if one was too busy when the bars cleared out, you could try the other one. I also remember this one having a cigarette machine in the entrance lobby, until those were all taken away.

**Burrard and Robson**

* The original **Central Branch of the library**. Enter the main doors, take a right and then take the steps (or escalator?) up to the 2nd floor to the kids section. Or maybe you remember it as the **HMV**. Or the **Virgin Records** with the basement floor full of DVDs and VHS tapes.
* The **Le Chateau** that's now an Arc'teryx.
* When **Marks and Spencer** had stores here, there was one near where the Indigo/aerie stores are now. There was also one at Oakridge, but both have been gone since the early 90s I believe. I miss a lot of the British food imports you used to be able to get there.

**Robson and Thurlow**

* The two **Starbucks** across the corner from each other. One still remains, one is now an Aritzia. In footage from the first Stanley Cup riots, you can see the one that‚Äôs now gone still under construction.
* **Pastels**. I don't remember much about this, but I believe it was a coffee shop.

**Thurlow and Alberni**

* The original location of **Red Robin** on the 2nd floor here. I remember back then they had TVs playing music videos all over the place.

**Robson and Bute**

* The **Book Warehouse** that became an **HMV** (before the Virgin Records became HMV). This was the larger of the two Book Warehouse locations downtown and I remember them having large bins of cheap paperback books. You used to see lots of Fighting Fantasy books in these bins, which are now collectible and ridiculously expensive. When it became an HMV, that was where I bought most of my tapes and CDs for the bulk of the 90s. I also saw Presidents of The United States of America play a free show here.
* The **Hooters** restaurant that was around in the 90s. It was previously a **Kenny Rogers Roasters** restaurant, and now it's a Japanese restaurant.

**Robson and Bute/Jervis**

* At some point in the 90s, I seem to remember a 2nd **Charlie's Place** location in the middle of the block across from the hotel. Charlie's Place was a large used CD/music/games/movies store on Granville across from where Capitol 6 stood.

**Robson and Jervis**

* **Fogg N' Suds** on the corner up top (now a Hannam Supermarket). In addition to this location, there was also one on Cambie/Broadway that closed when the restaurant below had an explosion. Looks like there's still one remaining in Richmond.

**Robson and Cardero**

* The **Blockbuster Video** that was on the corner here. I still preferred Mega Movies and Rogers Video.

**Robson and Bidwell**

* The **used book store** that was on Bidwell throughout most of the 90s (and maybe the 80s?).

**Robson and Denman**

* The original **Safeway** that had the large parking lot next to it.
* The **bank** that became a **Dairy Queen** that's now a Breka. Was it a Bank of Montreal? I can't remember this one.

**Denman and Barclay**

* **The Bay Theatre** that turned into the **Starlight Theatre** and is now a Blenz. There was [this mural ](https://westendvancouver.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/portion-of-mural-by-teresa-waclawik-wall-of-starlight-cinemas.jpg)by Teresa Waclawik that stood on the side of the building for a long time.

**Denman and Nelson**

* The bank that used to be on the corner next to a Shoppers Drug Mart, before the SDM expanded into the bank's space. It was a CIBC, I think?

**Denman and Comox**

* The **Canada Trust** that became a **Bread Garden** that became a liquor store.
* **Bud's Fish and Chips**, with your fish and chips to-go rolled up in newspaper.
* **Denman Place Cinema** downstairs with one of the steepest escalators I've been on outside of the Granville skytrain. This was my go-to theatre in the 90s for cheap movies, where you could see three movies for one ticket if you showed up to the 5pm showing. Not as dingy and sketchy as Paradise on Granville was. Now it's a Dollarama.

**Denman and Pendrell**

* The gas station on the corner that's now a parking lot. So many gas stations are gone from downtown now.

**The independently owned corner stores/grocery stores**

* The grocery store on Bute and Davie, across from the liquor store. Now a coffee shop.
* The convenience store at Nicola and Nelson. This is now the Greenhorn Cafe, and amazingly the dry cleaners are still next door.
* Another convenience store at Nicola and Barclay is still there I believe?

And yet throughout all this time, that plot of undeveloped land at Robson and Broughton is still there.",2,1758491488.0,askvan,1,1.0,False

## Chapter 1: First Impressions

David adjusted his tie as he walked through the glass doors of Morrison & Associates for his first day. The sleek London office buzzed with the energy of a successful consulting firm, and he felt the familiar mix of excitement and nerves that came with starting fresh.

""You must be our new analyst,"" came a warm voice behind him.

He turned to see an elegant woman in her early forties, impeccably dressed in a charcoal blazer, her dark hair pulled back in a sophisticated chignon. Everything about her radiated professional competence.

""I'm Sarah Chen, Senior Director of Strategy,"" she said, extending a manicured hand. ""Welcome to the team.""

""David Miller. Pleasure to meet you.""

Her handshake was firm, her smile genuine. Over the next few weeks, David couldn't help but notice how Sarah seemed to effortlessly command respect throughout the office. She was brilliant in meetings, insightful in her analysis, and surprisingly approachable despite her senior position.

What David didn't notice was how Sarah had positioned her temporary workstation to have a clear view of his desk. Or how she seemed to know his schedule better than he did. Or how she always managed to be in the kitchen when he made his morning coffee.

For three months, Sarah watched and learned.

## Chapter 2: The Approach

""David, excellent work on the Henderson report,"" Sarah said, appearing beside his desk one Tuesday morning. ""I was wondering - would you join me for the office drinks this Friday? I think you'd benefit from meeting some of our key clients.""

It seemed innocent enough. A senior colleague extending professional courtesy to a newcomer.

Friday arrived, and David found himself at a trendy pub near the office with a dozen colleagues. Sarah had changed from her usual conservative attire into something more fitted, her makeup subtle but striking. She positioned herself strategically, ensuring David could see her while she commanded the attention of several male colleagues.

When David approached the bar, Sarah was suddenly there beside him.

""Getting settled in well?"" she asked, stepping closer than necessary.

""Yes, everyone's been very welcoming."" 

She moved even closer, her breath warm against his cheek as she spoke. ""I'm glad,"" she whispered, the words carrying an undertone that made David's pulse quicken. Then she pulled back with a smile that seemed to linger a moment too long.

That night, David found himself thinking about Sarah Chen in ways that had nothing to do with quarterly projections.

## Chapter 3: The Dance

What followed was a careful choreography of attraction and withdrawal. Sarah would engage David in stimulating conversations about work, her intelligence and wit making her magnetic. Then she'd disappear for days, leaving David wondering if he'd imagined the connection between them.

Teams messages became frequent - professional at first, then tinged with humour and subtle personal touches. Sarah would share small details about her life: her love of Indian cuisine, her meditation practice, her weekend trips with her husband.

Her husband. That detail should have created distance, but somehow it only intensified the intrigue.

""You know,"" David mentioned to his colleague James one day, ""Sarah's quite remarkable. So accomplished, and surprisingly down-to-earth.""

""Sarah Chen? Yeah, she's brilliant,"" James agreed. ""Probably the most competent director we have. Bit intense sometimes, but that's what makes her so effective.""

David nodded, but James's description didn't match his experience. With him, Sarah was anything but intense. She was charming, almost vulnerable at times. The shy laughs when they talked privately. The way she'd unconsciously touch her wrist when nervous.

What David couldn't see was the calculation behind every gesture, every perfectly timed interaction.

## Chapter 4: The Test

Six months in, during an office celebration, David made what he thought was an innocuous joke about traditional gender roles. ""Well, you know how it is - men smoke cigars and drink whisky whilst the women cook and clean.""

Sarah's laugh seemed genuine, but something flickered behind her eyes. A flash of something cold.

The next week, she was different. Distant. Professional to the point of coldness.

David found himself analysing every interaction, wondering what had changed. He replayed that evening over and over, trying to understand where he'd gone wrong.

Sarah, meanwhile, was consumed by a rage she couldn't fully articulate. Here was this man, this junior colleague, reducing her - a successful woman who'd fought for every promotion, who'd proven herself in a male-dominated industry - to a domestic stereotype. The comment played on repeat in her mind, each iteration stoking the fire of wounded pride.

## Chapter 5: The Campaign

What followed was a masterclass in psychological manipulation disguised as workplace interaction.

Sarah began deploying tactics so subtle that David questioned his own perceptions. She'd position herself in his line of sight, making small adjustments to her posture that drew his attention. During their few interactions, she'd mention other male colleagues just enough to create a whisper of jealousy.

The hot and cold cycles intensified. Days of warmth and attention followed by periods of inexplicable distance. David found himself craving the good moments, constantly analysing his behaviour to understand what triggered her moods.

""You seem distracted lately,"" his friend Tom observed over lunch one day.

""Just work stuff,"" David replied, unwilling to admit that a senior colleague had somehow become the focal point of his emotional well-being.

Meanwhile, Sarah was experiencing something she'd never felt before. Previous workplace attractions had been simple games - a bit of flirtation, some ego gratification, then moving on when she grew bored. But David had done something unforgivable: he had wounded her identity.

That throwaway comment about gender roles played in her mind like a broken record. Every night, lying beside her oblivious husband, she fantasized not about romance with David, but about the moment he would break. The moment he would beg for her attention, admit her superiority, prove that she was the one with power.

She began to take genuine pleasure in his confusion. When she deployed the hot and cold cycles, she'd watch his face carefully, cataloguing every micro-expression of hurt or bewilderment. His pain had become her entertainment.

At home, her husband Mark noticed her improved mood. ""Good day at work?"" he'd ask, unaware that his wife's satisfaction came from psychologically tormenting a colleague.

""Very productive,"" Sarah would reply, her mind still replaying David's discomfort from that afternoon's interaction.

## Chapter 6: The Escalation

Sarah's behaviour began to cross lines that revealed her true nature. She'd find reasons to work late when David was in the office, but not for romance - for the thrill of having him trapped in her psychological web.

One evening, she cornered him in the supply room, standing close enough that he couldn't easily escape. But instead of seduction, she deployed something far more unsettling.

""You know,"" she said, her voice soft but her eyes hard, ""I've been thinking about our conversation the other night. About traditional gender roles."" Her smile was sharp. ""It's fascinating how some people cling to outdated ideas when the world has moved so far beyond them.""

David felt a chill that had nothing to do with attraction. This wasn't flirtation - it was psychological warfare.

""I think we should probably focus on work matters,"" he said, trying to step around her.

Sarah didn't move. For just a moment, her mask slipped completely, and David saw something genuinely frightening. Her eyes were cold, calculating, and filled with a rage that seemed disproportionate to anything he'd done.

Then the professional smile snapped back into place. ""Of course. Work is so important, isn't it?""

But as she walked away, David caught her glancing back with an expression of such malevolent satisfaction that he felt his stomach turn.

That night, Sarah lay awake again, but this time she wasn't thinking about romance or attraction. She was planning. David needed to be taught a lesson about respect, about power, about who really controlled whom. And she was going to enjoy every moment of delivering that education.

## Chapter 7: The Observation

David began keeping notes not just about Sarah's behaviour, but about his growing unease with what he was witnessing.

""She smiled when I struggled with the Henderson presentation,"" he wrote one evening. ""Not a sympathetic smile - she was genuinely pleased that I was having difficulty.""

""Asked me three times if I was 'getting enough sleep' after she'd spent the day positioning herself in my eyeline during important calls. She knew exactly why I was distracted.""

""Overheard her talking to Jenkins about the redundancy rumours. She seemed... excited about people's job insecurity. Not concerned - excited.""

The more David documented, the more disturbing the pattern became. Sarah wasn't just manipulating him - she was taking genuine pleasure in psychological discomfort, whether it was his confusion, colleagues' professional anxieties, or anyone's emotional distress.

During a team meeting where a junior analyst broke down under pressure, David watched Sarah's face. While others showed concern or embarrassment, Sarah's expression was one of fascination. She was studying the breakdown like a scientist observing an experiment.

""She doesn't feel empathy,"" David wrote that night. ""She feels... entertained.""

""She asked me about the office sports day,"" David wrote one evening. ""When I mentioned meeting new people, her entire focus shifted. Asked specifically if I'd met anyone interesting. Not casual curiosity - targeted intelligence gathering.""

The more David documented, the clearer the pattern became. Sarah wasn't experiencing workplace attraction. She was conducting a campaign.

## Chapter 8: The Revelation

During one of Sarah's strategic approaches - she'd timed it perfectly to catch him alone by the lifts - David decided to test something.

""You seem very centered,"" he said carefully. ""All that meditation must really help you stay... chill.""

For a split second, something terrifying flashed across Sarah's face. Pure, undiluted rage. Not hurt feelings or professional offense - genuine fury that someone had dared to question her constructed identity.

Then the mask snapped back, but her voice carried an edge of menace. ""Very astute observation, David.""

The way she said his name made it sound like a threat.

That afternoon, Sarah kept her jacket on despite the warm office temperature, sitting rigidly at her desk. But David caught her staring at him with such intensity that he felt genuinely unsafe. This wasn't attraction or even anger - it was the look of someone planning retaliation.

At home that evening, Sarah's husband Mark tried to engage her in conversation about their weekend plans. She answered in monosyllables, her mind entirely consumed with thoughts of punishment and control.

""Everything alright, love?"" Mark asked.

""Fine,"" Sarah replied, but her smile was the kind predators wear just before they strike. ""Just thinking about work. There's someone who needs to learn some important lessons about respect.""

Mark assumed she was talking about managing a difficult client. He had no idea his wife was fantasizing about the psychological destruction of a colleague who had committed the unforgivable sin of seeing through her facade.

David made another note: ""She cannot handle any question that challenges her constructed identity.""

## Chapter 9: The Experiment

After months of analysis, David had reached a chilling conclusion. He wasn't dealing with workplace attraction gone wrong, or even sophisticated manipulation. He was documenting the behaviour of someone who derived genuine pleasure from others' psychological suffering.

Sarah had revealed herself to be what clinical psychologists would recognize as a high-functioning psychopath with sadistic traits - someone who used professional competence as camouflage for behaviour that bordered on psychological torture.

When Sarah went on a business trip, David conducted his final experiment. He sent what appeared to be a caring message: ""Hope you're having fun. I expect you to speak some of the local language when you're back.""

It was perfectly crafted - kind enough to suggest continued interest, but actually a farewell. David predicted her response patterns: the obsessive analysis of his intentions, the desperate crafting of her reply to regain psychological control, the escalation of tactics upon her return.

But David had no intention of providing her with any further supply for her psychological sadism. The message was his goodbye, though Sarah wouldn't recognize it until much later.

Meanwhile, Sarah sat in her hotel room abroad, reading his message over and over. The caring tone felt like victory - proof that her patient psychological warfare was working. She began planning her return strategy, anticipating the moment when David would finally break completely under her manipulations.

She had no idea that her primary source of entertainment was about to disappear forever.

Days passed in silence. David watched from a position of complete psychological freedom, knowing that somewhere, Sarah was consumed by thoughts of him while he continued his life unaffected.

The power dynamic had completely reversed.

## Chapter 10: The Realization

""How's work?"" David's girlfriend Emma asked one evening as they cooked dinner together.

""Actually, much better. I've been dealing with someone quite... dangerous, but I think I understand the situation now.""

Emma paused in her chopping. ""Dangerous? Should you report them?""

David considered this. How do you report someone for taking pleasure in psychological suffering when they're careful never to leave evidence? How do you explain that your senior colleague is a sophisticated predator who uses professional competence as camouflage?

""It's complicated. She's very good at maintaining plausible deniability. But I've documented everything, and more importantly, I'm completely immune to her tactics now.""

""She?""

""A senior colleague who's been conducting what I can only describe as psychological warfare for over a year. I think she genuinely enjoys causing emotional distress. Not just manipulation - actual sadistic pleasure from others' suffering.""

Emma set down her knife. ""That sounds terrifying.""

""It was, until I understood what I was dealing with. Now she's just... fascinating, in a clinical sense. Like observing a psychological specimen.""

David realized he felt genuine pity for Sarah. Not sympathy - pity. She was trapped in a psychological prison of her own making, addicted to causing suffering because she was incapable of genuine human connection.

The woman who had spent over a year trying to prove her dominance was now alone with her pathology while her former target had achieved complete freedom.

## Chapter 11: The Predator Revealed

At his desk the following Monday, David watched Sarah operate with the detachment of a wildlife researcher observing a dangerous animal in its habitat.

She deployed the same positioning tactics, the same calculated glances, but now he could see them for what they truly were: the hunting behaviours of a psychological predator who fed on emotional distress.

When she walked past his desk, he offered a polite ""Good morning"" - the same greeting he'd give any colleague. Nothing more, nothing less.

Sarah stopped abruptly, her head turning toward him with predatory focus. For just a moment, her mask slipped completely, and David saw raw hunger in her eyes - not sexual desire, but the desperate need of someone whose primary source of psychological entertainment had just been cut off.

""Good morning,"" she replied, but her voice carried an undertone of menace.

David made a mental note: ""Complete indifference triggers genuine distress. She needs my emotional reactions the way an addict needs their substance.""

Over the following days, David observed Sarah's escalating attempts to regain his attention. She positioned herself more obviously, deployed increasingly dramatic gestures, even staged what appeared to be a minor workplace crisis.

But David remained professionally polite and emotionally absent. To Sarah, this was worse than hostility - it was proof that she had become psychologically irrelevant.

James stopped by David's desk one afternoon. ""Sarah's been asking about you. Wondering if everything's alright with your project work. She seems... concerned.""

David looked up, recognizing the predatory intelligence gathering. ""Everything's fine from my end.""

""Good. Between you and me, she's seemed a bit intense lately. More than usual.""

David nodded, understanding that others were beginning to notice the stress fractures in Sarah's carefully maintained facade. Without her primary source of psychological supply, she was becoming less controlled, more obviously dangerous.

The mask was slipping, and soon others might glimpse the predator underneath.

## Chapter 12: The Recognition

James stopped by David's desk that afternoon. ""Sarah seems a bit off lately. Everything alright with your project work?""

David looked up, realizing that others were beginning to notice what had been invisible before. Sarah's careful facade was showing stress fractures.

""Everything's fine from my end,"" David replied honestly.

""Good. She's been excellent to work with, but lately..."" James shrugged. ""Probably just the usual senior management pressures.""

David nodded, but he knew the truth. The pressure wasn't from senior management. It was from losing her primary source of psychological supply - his attention, his emotional reactions, his participation in her carefully constructed manipulation campaigns.

Without his engagement, Sarah was experiencing something she'd never felt before: genuine psychological starvation.

## Epilogue: The Freedom

Six months later, David submitted his final report on workplace psychological dynamics to the company's well-being committee. The document, carefully anonymized, outlined how sophisticated manipulation could operate invisibly within professional environments.

""Interesting analysis,"" the HR director commented during their meeting. ""Very thorough documentation. Have you considered presenting this at industry conferences?""

David smiled. ""I think it could be valuable for others to understand these patterns.""

As he walked home that evening, David reflected on his journey from target to analyst to survivor. He'd encountered something genuinely dangerous disguised as professional competence, documented its operation with scientific precision, and ultimately achieved complete psychological freedom.

Sarah Chen remained at Morrison & Associates, still brilliant in meetings, still respected for her strategic insights. But David knew what others couldn't see: beneath the professional excellence was a psychological predator whose most sophisticated target had simply... walked away.

The woman who had spent over a year trying to prove her dominance was now trapped in a prison of her own obsession, while her former target had transformed the experience into wisdom.

That was true victory - not revenge, not drama, but complete psychological freedom combined with genuine understanding of what he'd survived.

In his final note, David wrote: ""The most dangerous people in professional environments are often the most competent ones. Their excellence provides perfect camouflage for behaviour that would be recognised as predatory in any other context. But knowledge is power. Once you understand the machinery of manipulation, you become immune to its effects.""

He closed the notebook and filed it away. The case study was complete, but more importantly, he was free.

*The End*

**Author's Note:** This story is based on real workplace dynamics and documents the behaviour of what clinical psychologists would classify as a high-functioning psychopath with sadistic traits. While the characters are fictional, the manipulation tactics, psychological warfare, and predatory behaviours described are documented phenomena that occur in professional environments.

The purpose is educational and protective - to help readers recognise that the most dangerous workplace predators are often the most professionally competent, using their success as camouflage for behaviour that would be recognised as psychologically abusive in any other context.

Key warning signs include:
- Taking visible pleasure in others' distress or confusion
- Strategic positioning and environmental control
- Systematic psychological manipulation disguised as professional interaction  
- Inability to form genuine human connections despite surface charm
- Escalating boundary violations when targets resist manipulation

If you recognise these patterns in your workplace, trust your instincts, document everything, and seek appropriate professional support. Remember that professional competence does not preclude serious psychological pathology - in fact, it often provides perfect camouflage for it.",1,1758490792.0,LifeAfterNarcissism,2,1.0,False

Overall, we definitely loved Kauai the most. It was so relaxing and way less touristy. Honolulu just felt like any other touristy city with a beach. On Kauai we stayed at Ko‚Äôa kea and loved it, didn‚Äôt see a single child, very peaceful, great service, clean, amazing views and direct access to Poipu beach. If I were to go back, I would definitely do two separate hotels on north and south shore. It was a lot driving 1.5 hours one way to visit the north shore. 

On Oahu we stayed at the Sheraton Waikiki. I had high hopes for this but was a little disappointed (I think because we were comparing everything to Kauai which we loved). We had a great view from the balcony, direct access to Waikiki, and the elevators were super fast, but the service was just ok and the room didn‚Äôt feel like a 4 star hotel room. I think next time I would want to stay on the north shore! It was much less crowded and more relaxed up there.

Day 1 - Kauai
Landed in the afternoon, grabbed a Puka Dog for dinner and checked out the turtles on Poipu beach.

Day 2 - Kauai
Bagels and coffee at Rainbeau Jo‚Äôs (highly recommend!). We also tried the banana bread and a bagel at The Jammin Banana, didn‚Äôt love as much as Rainbeau Jo‚Äôs but was still good.
Picked up our pup for a field trip from the Kauai Humane Society. Checked out Shipwreck beach and walked the small trail behind it. Also walked the golf course path behind the Marriott in Lihue. Ate a late lunch at Kauai Sushi Station and grabbed some fresh fruit from Koloa Fruit Stand. Dropped off our pup and stopped by Costco for snacks for the hotel. Ate dinner at Red Salt (food was good but wouldn‚Äôt recommend, it was way overpriced).

Day 3 - Kauai
Got married:)
Also hit up the Musubi truck in Kapaa and Tunnels beach at sunset this day.

Day 4 - Kauai (North shore day)
Mokihana for coffee. Saenz Ohana for breakfast. Spent the day snorkeling at Anini beach. Saw a lot of turtles and fish! Got dinner at the Dolphin in Hanalei and checked out the shops. Got Jojos shave ice (was meh, wouldn‚Äôt recommend).

Day 5 - Kauai
Coffee at Eden Coffee. Headed to Kipu Ranch for the ATV waterfall tour. Then got Smiley‚Äôs for lunch, highly recommend was one of my favorite meals. Get the Smileys chicken or one of the loco moco plates. Dinner at the Beach House Restaurant, great service and gorgeous sunset view. Food was average. 

Day 6 - Kauai
Little Fish Coffee for bagels and coffee. Drove up to Waimea canyon and did the canyon trail. It started raining while we were on the trail so the way back was very slippery. Stopped by Kauai Coffee farm on the way back. Checked out the turtles one more time on Poipu then headed to the Smith‚Äôs Luau. The food was great, the performance was definitely a little lackluster tbh but I would still recommend it. 

Day 7 - Kauai/Oahu
Shopped around Koloa and ate breakfast at the Kauai Diner before heading to the airport to fly to Oahu. Landed in Oahu, hung out by the pool, then had a casual dinner at Honolulu Noodle. Got Mosa ice cream for dessert (highly recommend!).

Day 8 - Oahu
Hiked Diamond Head. Then got breakfast at Sweet E‚Äôs cafe and malasadas from Leonard‚Äôs. Relaxed by the pool/Waikiki beach. Did some shopping around Waikiki. Got dinner at Miro Kaimuki. It was our favorite meal of the trip, highly recommend!

Day 9 - Oahu
Coffee at The Well Kailua, so expensive but the banana bread latte was delicious. Stopped by Calvin and Susie for some souvenirs for our dogs. Then got some Poke and sushi from Foodland and headed to Lanikai beach. One of our favorite beaches of the trip. Got dinner at Haleiwa Joes in Haiku garden, food was average but nice location overlooking the garden.

Day 10 - Oahu (north shore day)
Green World Coffee Farm for coffee and Ted‚Äôs bakery for breakfast. Both were fantastic. Spent the morning snorkeling at Shark‚Äôs Cove. Saw tons of fish here too! Definitely more than Anini beach and you don‚Äôt have to swim far out to see them. Saw one turtle too. Then walked the shops in Haleiwa and grabbed a burger at Seven Brothers. Watched the sunset at Sunset Beach and got more Foodland sushi for dinner.

She invited me to eat lunch after she saw me in the dining hall with her friends on Friday, and after that we spent like 12 hours together (about 4 alone, 8 with her friends). Her friends had lunch and left fast and left us two together, and we talked for a while about random things. Had lunch, went on our school fair ferris wheel, shared a lemonade, waited in line for free merch together (with her friends), had dinner together (with her friends), hung out in her friends room (with her friends). Got her phone number.

Wanted to hang out yesterday but my family was visiting so couldn't really. Today I asked her if she wanted to go to a new coffee shop that opened nearby, and she said she couldn't due to an exam she had this week (she told me about this when we were eating lunch, she has a lot of prep to do), but she said we could go after. She said she was gonna be studying today (she's the type that can't really get things done by herself so that's why i didn't ask to study with her). She's also very academically inclined like myself and puts her GPA above all as she wants to go to grad school.

I was thinking of dropping some snacks off to her room (i know where it is because she gave me a dorm tour before we went to her friends room, im not a stalker). She usually studies in her room. The plan was to just attach it to her door handle, with an encouraging note or something on it, and hope she'd get it eventually.

Would this be creepy or nah? I have no idea if she's interested in me or not as i'm new to this kind of thing (i've never had female attention before college, and barely any female friends). Like I said earlier we took a lot of pictures together, and we also were very close and touching on the ferris wheel and she didn't move back so i don't think she hated it?? idk. She is also the type to randomly approach people she vaguely knows and talk to them, this has happened to me twice now by her. The day we spent 12 hours I also looked depressed and lonely right after our shared class (which I was), and i was thinking that's why she approached me, and it was out of kindness. I also have do not have much going on physically other then i'm 196cm 117kg (I used to be 125, i'm trying to lose weight). I've also been trying to get rid of my acne and it has been clearing up so maybe that's why i'm getting attention? idk.

tldr i spent a whole day  (12 hrs) with a girl i vaguely knew and i wanted to know if it would be creepy to drop off snacks while she's grinding for an exams",1,1758490619.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

Does it get better?,"I've been lucky to work remote or hybrid for most of my career (computer programmer), including my kids' (4 and 8 yrs) whole lives.

I've always kept normal hours+, my kids had full time childcare since infancy plus aftercare so it wasn't like hybrid was making it all work, and I wasn't that freaked out when the switch from hybrid (3/2) to full time in-office was announced over the summer.

Well.

A month in, and my mental health hasn't been this bad in years. I stopped going to therapy - no one missed me for 45 minutes biweekly before, but it's not possible in the office - but that isn't the main thing.

My husband just took our kids out for a couple hours (Sunday) and it hit me that this is the first time I've been \*alone\* in a month. Other than in the newborn stage, I've always had alone time while working!

I thought because I was working, it didn't count as ""me time"", but there's still the solitude of walking to the quiet, clean kitchen to make coffee, the relaxed transition from the morning hubbub with kids to logging into work, listening to the radio while making a sandwich for lunch - things that seemed insignificant but now that they're gone, I don't feel like myself.

I also had a walking pad and I walked 3-4 hours a day during my WFH days, surrounded by sunny windows in my home office. Now I just sit all day, every day, in a cubicle in a windowless office with a wall 12 inches from my face in all directions.

As I imagine is true for a lot of working moms, I'm fiercely attached to being a present, great mom during the limited time I am with my kids, and I can't bring myself to take any of that precious time away to explore a hobby or go to the gym or have their Dad take them out or whatever the internet tells me might help me regain my sense of self.

I'm confused because I love my job and don't want to leave over this. In theory I didn't think I minded working full time in the office, but I didn't realize I'd never actually done it as a mom before, and I'm not sure how else to turn this mental health nose dive around other than applying for other jobs.

Anyone with this situation find it got better after an adjustment? Or did you leave a full time in-person job you loved for hybrid or remote and are happy you did?",14,1758490376.0,workingmoms,9,0.94,False

(on the dot) We kept in touch for about 5 months every now and then, but went full on no contact in may as he got a new girlfriend. We ended on good terms, but I felt that it was right that we don‚Äôt keep in touch as she felt unsecure and it just felt weird on my part as well.

Fast forward to today, all of a sudden he adds me on Facebook and reaches out to me. (Eventhough he still has my number) He Said sorry for not reaching out earlier and wondered how I‚Äôve been- which isn‚Äôt like him, there‚Äôs usually a straight forward message that he needs help with something, or some message in the background. We send a few messages back and forth talking about how it‚Äôs going- but something feels off to me. 
As I Said he usually just doesn‚Äôt reach out to someone out of nowhere, especially after so long time. We we‚Äôre also in the same friendgroup who still see each other, but just 1 month ago when we were at my place he didn‚Äôt give any answers to if he was joining or anything, just watched the messages in the groupchat and ignored it. 

But the things that bugged me while messaging now are these:

- when i asked why he was reaching out he answered with ‚Äùyou have for a long time been the most important person in my life, so I can‚Äôt fully let you go properly. Even though we‚Äôre not in a relation I still care about you‚Äù 

- he Said that ‚Äùthe time I spent with you was definently the best time of my life‚Äù followed by ‚Äùi really hope you can get over everything and find someone that truly deserves you‚Äù 
To me it feels REALLY weird to describe the time he had with me as the best time of his life, AS HE STILL IS IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS NEW GF? (of what i know at least, didn‚Äôt mention anything about that in the messages) Like i wouldn‚Äôt get sad if he Said that he enjoyed our time togheter, but it feels better now. But shoudln‚Äôt this be his best time?? If he‚Äôs in a new relationship that should feel better than what we had??? 

- when i asked if I could add him on Instagram as Well he Said sure and the reason that he removed me and stopped following me was because ‚Äùshe wanted to remove all insecurites in the begining of them dating, but that it‚Äôs no worries now‚Äù and when asked ‚Äùwhy is it okay now then?‚Äù He just answered ‚Äùno.‚Äù So i don‚Äôt really know why??? 

I can add that we saw each other at a gathering in may with the others and stayed and hour just us talking. During that hour he Said that he still missed me and that he always found me attractive- and still does. On top of that two people in the group reached out the day after and asked if i noticed how he looked at me, as Well as my mom when picking me up. We also have each other a hug back then, during the hug he just Held tighter and tighter and was the one who let go of the hug. (He was in the relationship back then to add) 

He also suggested talking or meeting for a coffee someday today. 

I‚Äôm really confused on what‚Äôs going on. Part of me feels like he and her broke up, and that he‚Äôs trying to return back. But i‚Äôm not quite sure, but something feels off. He also still has my number, so i don‚Äôt know why he felt that he needed to reach out on Facebook? I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going behind her back or something. 

Am i overreacting or is something about this off??

TDLR; ex reached out of nowhere after 4 months no contact bc he had a new GF. Said that the time with me was the best time of his life and that he can‚Äôt fully let go even tough we‚Äôre not togheter. Is something wrong about this or am i overthinking/reacting?

I've been experiencing weird electrical events in my home (101-year-old multi-unit building). A lot of it feels silly to call an electrician over, but I don't know, maybe not.

The TL;DR is a monthish ago my breaker tripped and wouldn't reset. The next day I tried again and it reset fine. 

But then on Friday it happened again. I don't run a lot of electronics, and have definitely pulled more power than what I was pulling when it tripped. I was really, really sick when it happened, so I gave up and went without power in my main living area. 

After 24 hours I was starting to feel better and I began trying again. I tried resetting it, there was a rumbling sound every time I tried to reset the breaker. What was weird was the rumbling sound was in a different location each time ‚Äîat first in the ceiling far from the breaker across the room, and eventually about a foot from the breaker. 

I went upstairs, did some reading and based on what I read:

* Unplugged my computer and lamp to prevent it from overloading when I reset it. This makes sense on paper, as I've always wondered why the breaker is able to reset after it trips without first turning off everything that caused the overload. But why would, for the first time in my life, require me to power everything off before resetting it when such an insignificant amount of power was being drawn relative to what typically sets it off?
* Made sure I was flipping the switch all the way when I reset it. This also makes sense on paper, but how do you not flip a breaker switch all the way?? Every breaker switch I've ever flipped SNAPS when flip it. I don't understand how not flipping it all the way is even possible. Even so, I snapped it extra, if possible. 

This time there was no sound, but I briefly saw spark (I'm pretty sure) from inside the switch. I wasn't sure if I saw the spark, so I tried to record a video and do it again, but nothing happened: no sound or spark. I went back upstairs and my power was restored. I don't know for certain which of the two fixes fixed it.

So I feel like I'm good? But also, what's odd is that all I did to trip it in the first place was turn on my AC. I hadn't used it in about two weeks, but my AC has never led to a trip, not even when I simultaneously run the vacuum. 

I'm on a bit of high alert because I've been noticing weird things with my electrical lately, things that I don't understand and seem silly to call an electrician over, but maybe not, I don't know:
* All of the light bulbs in my overhead lights burnt out at the same time across different circuits. I replaced them and then it happened again two weeks later. This was a couple months ago.
* Shortly after, everyone in my building lost power. I've lived in Chicago 19 years and have not once lost power. Ever. Everyone in my building was mystified by it. There were no reported outages at the time.
* The first time my breaker tripped I was either turning on a lamp or changing the bulb. It sparked like it was an arcing, the power went out, but there are zero signs of arcing at the base and socket. I've been too scared to use it since, so it's been without a bulb since then. This was the lamp I unplugged to restore my power this weekend.
* This one I'm bringing up in case it's my AC unit and not my electrical causing the issue: a couple weeks ago, my AC unit began making a rattle, then went back to normal. I was at my desk working, and out of nowhere, it shot a huge gust of air, sending my coffee mug, which was full of coffee and on my desk a couple feet from the ac unit, sailing. Again, the coffee mug was full, so that's a pretty strong force to shoot an object across the room. (And fun tidbit, it spooked my cats so much that it sent them in that flying in an extra dimension thing cats do when they get startled, but when they did this they must have collided with each other, knocked a vase off my coffee table, and between the water, broken ceramic, broken glass, and coffee all over my rug, wowsers that was a mess to clean up.) My AC has been fine ever since.

When my power restored this weekend, I experienced a brief brownout shortly after. Everything has been fine since.
 
It feels like my circuit was just overloaded and I'm fine. Maybe I'm being paranoid. However, I know electrical isnt something to take lightly. But neither is spending a several hundred dollars for a service call over a tripped breaker that is since working fine. 

Lastly, I one hundred percent get that it's best to use caution and I do not intend to just take advice from strangers on the internet. The reason I'm posting this is to to gain perspective on what may be going on.",1,1758489700.0,AskElectricians,3,1.0,False
1nn42df,https://www.reddit.com/r/LesbianActually/comments/1nn42df/inexperienced_lesbian_seeking_some_advice/,Inexperienced lesbian seeking some advice‚Ä¶.,"Hi,

I apologise in advance for how long this is probably going to be.

I‚Äôm 31F and have never been in a relationship with anyone before. I have never hooked up or kissed anyone in my life.  I‚Äôm a homebody who works mostly night shifts. So my life is just going to work and coming home chilling. I don‚Äôt go out that much because of social anxiety.

Today at work a lady asked me out for a coffee. This lady works where I do, but her role is completely different to mine so we don‚Äôt work together. When she first started at my workplace I had a little crush on her as I thought she was very beautiful and was always friendly and nice towards me. That‚Äôs all it was though, just an innocent crush on a woman who I thought was unattainable. Never in a million years would I have thought she would be interested in me in any other way as I assumed she was very straight and married. She is also couple of years older than me.

My dumbass replied to her saying that ‚Äò‚ÄôI don‚Äôt know‚Äô‚Äô. Then she said what do you mean that you don‚Äôt know? I said ‚Äò‚ÄôI don‚Äôt know again‚Äô‚Äô like the fool I‚Äôm.  She really caught me by surprise so I was fumbling my words. Of course after this she seemed a little put off by that as one might be after working up the courage to ask someone out. After that she was walking away‚Ä¶ and I quickly said something which I don‚Äôt actually remember exactly and she said we can swap numbers. So she put her number into my phone and that was that. 

I reacted that way because I have never been in a situation like this before, it‚Äôs a very rare phenomenon for me. I didn‚Äôt know whether she was gay or even remotely interested in me in that way. It‚Äôs not like we shared a lot of longing looks and smiles or anything like that. 

A couple of days ago, she asked me how old I was and some other weird questions. At the time I was wondering why she was asking me these random things. 

Since I don‚Äôt know her all that well and it wasn‚Äôt clear to me whether she wanted to go out for coffee as friends or as in a date I went and found her a little while later and asked her. She said if you want it to be a date then it will be. She said she likes to take things slow and if it turns out that we don‚Äôt like each other then no stress. 

I didn‚Äôt reply for a while and she said ‚Äò‚ÄôI hope you don‚Äôt have a boyfriend‚Äô‚Äô. I said I‚Äôm not   into men. I think she was happy to hear that, because apparently everyone that she thought is a lesbian turned out to be straight and engaged etc. 

I said to her I‚Äôll contact her and let her know when I‚Äôm free. Then she said something about kids. I didn‚Äôt know she had children. I asked her if she did and she said I thought you already knew. I told her I don‚Äôt know that much about you. I feel like such a fucking idiot, I wonder if she has been crushing on me this whole time and I didn‚Äôt have a fucking clue? 

Since she confirmed that she has children I‚Äôm very confused as I don‚Äôt want to date someone who wants or has children. That‚Äôs just my preference.

The question I wanted to ask you guys is should I go for a harmless coffee with her just to experience what it‚Äôs like? As maybe a chance like this might never come along for me again as selfish as it sounds?  As I have mentioned earlier I have never been with anyone or done anything like this. 

I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt waste her time because I don‚Äôt want to date someone who has children.  So if we go out and we both end up hitting it off (which is highly unlikely as I‚Äôm a master fucker upper) then I will be being disingenuous towards her. 

So what should I do? Text her telling the truth or is it better to tell her in person? Or should I just go out with her once for a coffee?

I‚Äôve had this strange, recurring issue for the past 4 years, and no doctor has been able to give me a clear diagnosis. It‚Äôs honestly taking a toll on me.

Every single morning ‚Äî regardless of what I eat or drink ‚Äî I experience a sharp pain in my lower abdomen or pelvic area. It can happen whether I‚Äôve had coffee, breakfast, or even just water. The pain can be quite intense and lingers for a while. But here‚Äôs the strange part: once I go to the bathroom and have a bowel movement, the pain goes away. After that, I can eat normally throughout the day and feel completely fine. No issues during the afternoon or evening. It‚Äôs always just in the morning.

Over the past few years, I‚Äôve had a number of tests done ‚Äî colonoscopies, ultrasounds, etc. ‚Äî and nothing abnormal has shown up. Some doctors have suggested it might be IBS, but I‚Äôve always understood IBS to be more food-triggered, and this feels more like a routine pattern than a reaction to specific foods.

One doctor mentioned it might be pelvic congestion syndrome, but nothing‚Äôs ever been confirmed. I feel like I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of guessing games and living with daily pain that no one seems to understand.

Also, I‚Äôve noticed that whenever my period is due or just starting, the pain gets significantly worse ‚Äî especially when I go to the bathroom to urinate. I get sharp, almost stabbing pains during that time, then after my period it goes back to the same routine.

Has anyone experienced anything like this or have any idea what it could be? I‚Äôd really appreciate any insight.

Thank you üíõ

I recently did a 3 day water fast. During the fast I drank around 4L of water daily and added salt to it.

I broke the fast yesterday at around 2:45 pm with chia seeds in water, then had bone broth at 3:30 pm, 2 boiled eggs at 5:40 pm, and later some protein. This morning I just had black coffee and a 2 egg omelette.

Today (about 28 hrs after breaking my fast), I was sitting at an event with my legs crossed for 20‚Äì30 minutes. When I stood up, my legs were numb, my vision started going black, and I felt extremely lightheaded. Within seconds I fainted.

My friend said I was out for 30‚Äì60 seconds and had some jerky movements that looked like mini seizures. When I woke up, I remember it felt like a dream. I could hear nothing while fainted. After they splashed water and gave me something sweet to drink, I recovered and felt normal again. Right now I feel fine, no weakness, no headache, no confusion.

This has never happened to me before. I‚Äôm not on any medications.

Would really appreciate input from anyone who‚Äôs 
been through this. Also curious how you all handle electrolytes during extended fasts is plain water + salt enough?

I ended it because I had the illusion of a lack of chemistry at the end of the second date because conversation died off 

Then I thought about it and realized I've been going about second dates incorrectly all along - I'd feel the same way if I hung out with friends in the same context. 

To this point, I should point out I've had the same second date formula for all 11 women I went on second dates with in the past 2 years, except for 1 - and after all of them, I had the same conclusion, felt meh because the convo died out. Except for one, where we had dinner then went to a comedy show after. That was the only time something blossomed into something that lasted a solid amount of time.

 I simply can't talk for hours on end with anybody if we are just sitting there doing nothing - signalling to me that I am judging the ability to form a connection with someone using an impossible standard.

I proved this to myself by getting coffee with a friend today and after 2 hours I was just done and went home. And this is a guy I click with. This kind of proved my theory.

So after that second date I messaged her saying I was super on the fence so it's only fair to her that we don't continue this, and that id see her around.

I told my friends about my revelation, and they thing I should get back to her and propose a third anyway.

I figure I don't have anything to lose, but I'm afraid I'm kind of playing games with her. It didn't seem like she was head over heels for me either though, so maybe it would be fine.

I think I should at least give it a bit, maybe a week or two if I even decide this is a good idea.

I also think I should be really clear and show her my thinking above. I think it's a good thing to communicate that I fault my actions on my own inability to plan an engaging date.

I'll often have a cup of coffee with breakfast before my first meds dose and wait for that to kick in before I medicate. I can't do coffee for a few hours afterward without getting a headache and a burst of sad, so I try to do just enough to wake up.

I've noticed that, shortly after I take my first dose, I'll get hit with a wave of fatigue that feels almost like a whole-body sugar crash. This persists in some form until I take my second dose- protein and sunlight help sometimes but not always, it's worse when my sleep schedule is off even if I get a full 8 hours, water always helps. My sleep schedule is awful, which definitely is contributing. Sometimes caffeine helps, if it's been long enough since my first dose. This can't be a generic manufacturer discrepancy since both doses are from the same lot, but I have run afoul of inconsistent generics before.

I was previously on 2*20mg XR on the same schedule, and this particular issue wasn't a problem- then, I felt great until after my second dose, which put me in the way too high zone. I just spoke with my psych about switching to a 20+10 XR setup and he was fine with it, so I'm hoping that'll help.

What now?","Let‚Äôt‚Äôs be real everyone..if you‚Äôve applied to 100 jobs online and haven‚Äôt heard back, it‚Äôs not always on you - it‚Äôs because of how the job search system is currently.

Here‚Äôs why:
- Online apps (I call these Tier 4) are the weakest way to get noticed. Referrals and hiring manager recs (Tiers 1‚Äì2) are way stronger Ôøºto land interviews with qualifications 
- Recruiters get FLOODED with hundreds of resumes, especially with all of these AI apply tools (ex: you swipe and you can apply to each and every job). If your resume doesn‚Äôt match keywords or stand out in seconds, it‚Äòs not going to get interviews.

So what should you do?

1. Fix your resume

If 100 apps = 0 callbacks, odds are your resume isn‚Äôt showcasing the right experiences and/or isn‚Äôt showing impact. Focus on results, not tasks. Example: ‚ÄúIncreased sales using Salesforce CRM by 30%‚Äù > ‚ÄúResponsible for sales.‚Äù

2. Stop relying only on online apps

Reach out to hiring managers or team members before applying. Even a short LinkedIn message can move you up from Tier 4 to Tier 1-2Ôøº; aim for 10 outreach messages per role. If no replies in 3 days, then apply and move on Ôøº.

3. Network, whether through coffee chats or informational interviews

Coffee chats work. People are more likely to refer someone they‚Äôve spoken to, but comes the question - who do you reach out to with the best response? 1) Start with alumni, people with similar backgrounds, or 2) those who post content in your field.

100 apps in 1 week sounds like progress, but if they‚Äôre all cold online apps, it‚Äôs like you‚Äôre just playing the lottery. Shift to networking + referrals (while still applying) and you‚Äôll see interviews start landing.

Nature, it is a beautiful and horrifying thing.
Be the rolling hills of sand in the deserts and by the sea. 
the trees, rivers and mountains ranges that make up our forests and jungles. 
It's Beautiful for the view, the experiences and adventures. 
But also terrifying for the same reasons. During the day you can feel peaceful and relaxed, knowing everything around you is where it belongs, if it be the squirrels and chipmunks running around and climbing trees, to the birds singing they're songs and soaring the sky's above. 

You know they belong, you know what they are. You can hear them. You can smell them maybe. But you definitely bar none, can see them. 
And then as night falls, the same place that gave you peace and comfort. Now brings the unknown, the unsure, the unseen. Darkness is your only friend. Cause it's all you see, and all you know for sure is there. And what if you couldn't hear? Nothing at all. It Makes it all a hundred times worse. it's why I'm telling you this story, to know that when you go out in the woods. To not forgot, to say Hello while you're out there. 

So here we go. 
About a year and a half years ago, i sent an application in to the department of Wildlife Resource Management and got a one time job working at a remote observation cabin deep in the Game Lands of the Appalachia Mountains. 

It was a one year contract, just go to the cabin by myself, that'll be equipped with a radio to check in with my supervisor at a Ranger station not far from me, and walk around a 20 mile fenced in radius around the cabin, and simply take notes of what I see and make a daily report about my encounters. 
Take note of any and all animal activity, movements and numbers and what they are and report my finding to the Wildlife Resource Commission database through a computer at the cabin. I also had to keep an eye on local rivers, small creeks and ponds near by for anything that I'd have to notify the Forestry Services, about potential flash flood hazards and also of course looking for potential wild fires and get word back quickly. 

All that And be paid more than I've made in my two and a half years at my last job? 
Yeah I signed up faster than I could breathe and think. 

I grew up in the mountains and love being outdoors. I could hike extremely well and I was also med certified, could tie multiple knots and had taken a survival training course when I was young. it seemed like an easy job, and a way to get away from life at home. What bad could happen? 
After applying for the position, it was a week later and I heard back from the WRM and they said I got the job and asked when I could start

I said
""immediately if possible?""

They said it was deal and we scheduled my start date for the next morning, I was given an address to a Ranger station near where I'd be staying. 

The woman i spoke with told me 
""You'll need to meet with Ranger Richardson at 8am tomorrow morning for paperwork and a baggage check for contraband and non assigned items and""

 I interrupted her asking
""I have a question. What are and aren't things I can bring with me?"" 

Her response was well.
 ""sir if you would have taken a chill pill and waited I was about to list them off, no need to rush me. so please be patient."" 

Feeling embarrassed, I replied. 
""oh sorry, jumped the gun I guess there.""
I laughed harder than I should have.

She responded seemingly annoyed with having to deal with me.
""well since you just mentioned it, all firearms and weapons are prohibited from being brought by in employees. There is to be absolutely no alcohol, no drugs allowed. All items such as toiletries and clothing and anything you wish to bring for entertainment is allowed. Food will be provided to you every 2 weeks. Water and power are available at the cabin. And you'll get daily check ins for any issues and well being."" 

So the don't bring with me list make sense, don't want any lonely people in the middle of nowhere drinking and possibly on drugs with a gun. Could cause any kinds of problems.

So after going over everything I needed to know for now. we hung up, I got to packing what I needed as fast as possible, took me about a good day and half to pack everything for a whole year, brought my favorite books and some puzzles to keep me busy when there's nothing to do. 
And bring at least a week worths of clothes and shoes for each season of the year. Easy list. 

It took awhile getting it all loaded up in my car, I took a final list of my things and went back in my house to make sure I wasn't forgetting anything. Since they wanted me there the next morning, I decided to drive there before it got dark and stay at a campground I found not far from the station.
From where I lived it was a good 6 hour drive to there, so thankfully I did happen to live not insanely far like states away, and it also helped that I liked to drive. After locking up the house and speaking with a neighbor about collecting my mail. I sent out and head for the campground. 

The drive there was uneventful and boring. But since I left town early enough I was able to stop in to a few places and just take in some views. About the only good thing that happened the whole time. 
I make it to the campground not long before dark, I found a tent only site so I didn't have check In with anyone. I set up camp for the night and eat a little dinner and take in some of the beautiful night sky. I get ready for to go to bed, and get a good nights sleep, And be ready for the new day to begin.

Chapter 2.-

So I woke up the next morning early to get cleaned up and a little coffee in me before heading to meet with Ranger Richardson. 
Got my coffee and teeth brushed and a good shower to help get my engine running. 
Once I got dressed I packed away camp and cleaned my mess. Made sure everything was in the car and headed for the station. 
I pulled in about five minutes til 8am and was greeted by a gate guard. Who looked about as awake as a dead fish. I rolled my window down and he began his stick.

""Hi I'm Ranger Jonah Reese with the Pisgah National Park Rangers, I need to see an I.D. and to know your reason for being here""

He said all while barely holding his head up and eyes open. I handed him my I.D. And replied 

""Yeah I'm the new hire for one of the look out cabin, I was told to meet with Ranger Richardson for baggage check and paperwork.""  

He looked confused at my response but looked at my I.D. And when he handed it back to me he said

""Oh, okay. go ahead and park by Zone 4, good luck up out there, Don't forget to say, ""Hello"" out there.""

Before I could say anything he went back into his guard hut and shut the door. 

""Hmm, okay? That's a bit weird""

 I thought to myself but decided not to think too much into it. 

So I just went and found a spot where he said to go. Zone 4, spot 7. Got what I needed out and locked the car and went inside the station, the main door was unlocked and me assuming they knew I was coming and expected me. I didn't think to knock so I walked on in 

""Hello? New hire for one of."" 

before I could finish my sentence, a guy with undone pants, no shirt and no shoes, he looked half awake. He screams. 

""OH HEY DIDN'T YOUR MOMMA TEACH YOU TO KNOCK!"" 

Now much more awake than he first was. I screamed back. 

""OH MY GOD IM SORRY"" 

I said and Slamming the door behind me and stepping away to control myself from how awkward and not a good look I have now made. 
After a couple of minutes the same guy came out fully dressed except for his shoes, had them in his one hand and coffee in the other.
Me wanting to apologize and not be too embarrassed or awkward about what happened. I said. 

""Hey I'm sorry for just barging on in there, I thought it was just an office room or welcome area in there. Didn't think anyone would be there well...like that."" 

He sits down at a picnic table just outside the station. 
He lights up a cigarette and after taking a drag. 
He gave me a still just waking up dead stare, not to amused. He starts to talk and says. 

""Knock before you enter, any where. I'm at least glad you made sure to say ""Hello,"" get use to that out here and don't forget it. and you also started explaining yourself, if not for that I probably would have come at you and lord knows how that would have went. No offense just think next time. 
I haven't introduced myself yet, I'm Ranger Josh Richardson, Second in command here at OutPost Chance of the Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you Uhh?"" 

""Oh, I'm Alex. Pleased to meet you Josh. You're the Ranger Richardson, the one I'm supposed to meet with?""

He finished putting his boots on, and taking another sip of coffee. 

""No that'll be my Father, John ""Rich"" Richardson, he was on the phone with the folks at Headquarters about a fire in the next county over"" him getting another sip of coffee, and lighting up a cigarette. ""He'll be off soon, it's a fire that we shouldn't have to deal with, but we still need to get heads up just in case."" 

Taking a drag off of his cigarette and looking me up and down. 

""What made you wanna come out here? Why this job?"" 

I was kinda confused when he asked me this, I'm a little small compared to some dudes but I didn't look like no city boy gone country. 

""I grew up around woods my whole life and I needed some time away from normal life you know. And the pay didn't seem to bad either so I just figured why not. Why do you ask?"" 

Him looking at the ground and took a drag off his cigarette, followed by him finishing his coffee. He then says. 

""Just didn't seem the type, no offense."" 

I put on a good fake smile and a nod 

""None taken, I get that a lot. But I can handle myself well enough out here, or at least we'll see for sure."" 

He looked at me like I was the silliest and most naive kid he'd ever seen. 

""Yeah we'll see bud."" 

After a few minutes of chit chat with Josh, Ranger Richardson came out the door, tall, hero looking official type with a nice and clean Cowboy hat on to boot and he looked at and said to Josh

""Jesus boy could have you kept down a little bit earlier! Interrupted my call with Sam! And who are you young man."" 

Did anyone know I was coming? Ehh. They Must of forgot. 
But Josh responded before I could 

""This little Turd is the reason I screamed, this is the new hire for Cabin 12, didn't knock on the door and came right on in. Thanks for mentioning he was coming pops."" 

Ranger Richardson giving Josh a stare only a dad could give his son. And than looked to him and said. 

""Well I wasn't expecting to be on the phone and wasn't excepting you to be up before he got here. So Hush your lip up boy before I remind that you're here because of me and can leave here because of me."" 

Than he turned towards me and put a nice, warm smile on his face. 

""And sorry for not meeting you first. Next County over noticed a small Wild fire starting about 2 miles from our County lines. Should be dealt with by the other Counties stations, but we still needed to be notified. 
Ranger Johnathan Richardson Head of Outpost Chance and The Pisgah National Park. Pleased to meet you Alex."" 

He stuck he's hand out for a shake and I did mine, almost broke my hand while shaking it and you could tell this man has been in the woods most his life. Definitely not no soft hands. He let my hand go and He waved to me to follow him and said.

""Come on inside and let's get a coffee and go over something's in there. And while we're talking inside, care if Josh checks all your things you plan to bring for anything you shouldn't have and get them out of your car for you?"" 

Me following him and responding. 

""Yeah that's fine, everything is in the trunk and anything in the back seats forward can stay in the car, here's the key."" 

Handing the key to Josh and following Ranger Richardson. He looks to Josh and says

""be careful with his stuff boy, and make sure you load it on the cart properly, weight in the front, got it? And no judgment of their things"" 

Josh looking back at him and said

""If I find a dildo or anything along those lines, I'm gonna make a joke about it."" 

I looked to Josh and said 

""I have a count on them all, so I'll know if one's missing."" 

Ranger Richardson began laughing and still walking to the station, he opened the door for me and we both walk inside. 
He pours me a cup of coffee and we sit down to talk the job and safety precautions. 
We talked for a little over an hour about the normal routine and routes I'll take to scout my section. And going over everything I'll be provided for the cabin and myself. The every 2 week food drop offs, I can make requests for certain things each drop off for the next one. And what equipment I should expect when I get there. 

""The radio is your most important and valuable tool out there. You'll have multiple batteries and a rechargeable one with charger, if you lose it you can't get ahold of us if you get lost or hurt. So keep it on you."" 

He held out a decent size military looking hand radio with a long antenna and a strap for putting around your hand. And a little piece of paper with all channels and contacts. 

""And A computer is at the cabin to type your daily field reports, and send them back to headquarters and respond to messages from other outpost and stations. There are a couple of older games on everyone's computer so if you get bored you'll have that mess with. And anything else, flash lights, matches and lighters. Cooking stuff and everything else needed will be in the cabin for you. Any questions or concerns so far?"" 

Knowing I had majority of my main things with me, and that'll I'll have food and water and majority of what I need, I did think to ask one thing.

""Is there anything to protect myself with at the cabin? Like even just bear spray?"" 

Ranger Richardson chuckled deeply and nodded 

""Yes you'll have a few things, you'll have a knife, main thing we issue for protection. They're be an Axe and a Machete for clearing debris of of trails and other things like that. And the last resort and you have to call in for it. There's pump action 12g in a safe with enough shells to keep you alive against 3 or 4 bears, but no one has ever needed to call in for the code. But you at least have a couple of things and you're welcome to set them up for your needs. Any other questions?"" 

Only could think of one other question. 

""Yes, what's so important about saying hello? Both Jonah and Josh mentioned.""

before I could even finish, Ranger Richardson slammed his hand on the table and looked me dead in the eyes.

""Just do it. No matter what. Whenever you enter somewhere, always say hello. Just do it and don't forget it."" 

He narrowed his eyes looking at me and said in a stern voice.

""Do I make myself clear Son?"" 

I probably for once this whole time showed a little nervousness and maybe even some fear, but I responded. 

""Yes sir, crystal clear. understood."" 

He lightens up a bit and puts back on a warm smile. 

""Good deal. Now let's go see how Josh is coming along with your bag check and get you headed on your way, long walk ahead for you."" 

We walk outside and Josh is at the table we sat at earlier, he's finishing my last bag and getting it loaded on to a little pull behind cart. Ranger Richardson looked at me and said

""watch this"" 
and asked Josh. 

""Boy are you done inspecting his things and got him loaded and ready to go? Or do I need to kick you in your ass a little to get done faster?"" 

He laughed a little and Josh laughed as well and responded 

""Yeah his cart is loaded and good to go, and everything he brought was good and approved. Nothing he shouldn't have or makes me question him."" 

Ranger Richardson chuckled and smiled at him. 

""Good deal, now go get yourself to work on something else and I'll send him off."" 

Josh walked away and went back inside the station. 

Ranger Richardson hands me a map and a compass. And begins to explain my trip ahead. 

""You'll follow this trail here until you get to this fork, take the left and keep going for about 7 miles. Once you pass a decent size creek with a small bridge, you're almost there. Remember, Radio in if you need anything or have a question about something. Report anything of interest or concern. Understood?"" 

I nodded and took the radio and map from him and began getting my stuff ready.

""Thank you for the introduction and advice Ranger Richardson."" 

He got a harsh look on his face, but slowly turned into a smirk. 

""That's Rich son, no need to be to be to formal with me."" 

""Yessir Mr Rich. sorry, can't take my manners out of me."" 

He shook my hand and gave me a nod.

""All good son, good luck. And remember, say Hello out there.""

I reply 

""Yes Sir"" 

We stoped shaking hands and say our byes for now. And I head off to the cabin. To start my yard adventure. Or what I thought was an adventure. Only turned into a nightmare. 

End of Chapter 2.

Chapter 3.
-
I set out and got on my journey to the cabin. The pull along cart I was given is not the greatest. Not a great handle to hold to and pull with.
But it at least has big wheels for a cart and isn't awkward to pull. It's heavy but that's what I get for having a year's of stuff on it. But thankfully the trail itself is, for the most part fairly flat and smooth. nothing the cart has had trouble with yet.

From the start of the Ranger Station to the Cabin. 
I had a good 5 or so hour hike ahead. I'd get to see a bit of the area I'd be taking care of and keeping a look out on. So a nice first introduction here. 
Passed several of the small creeks Mr Rich told me about, stopped and took a few small notes, noticeable rocks and trees for land marks. and how the water was flowing and that I noticed a few small animals drinking out of it. Nothing out of the ordinary for being in the woods.

After about two hours I had to stop and take a break. Pulling the cart was taking its toll on me and my legs were reminding me of my last two and a half years sitting in a chair for work. 
So I get a little bit of food to snack on out of one of the bags I had in my cart. And also i grab a thermos with water out to get something to sip on.

Took some drinks of water and took some bites of my candy bar and just enjoyed the view.
Taking in the sights around me and hearing the wonderful noises of nature in its own world. I write down some notes and that's when I noticed something odd. 
For awhile I heard all the normal sounds of the woods. 
Wind blowing, trees moving and birds singing and animals running around. 

As I'm sitting there eating and reading
notes. 
I notice, that very slowly. It started getting eerily quiet, birds stopped singing. All the little animals stopped running. And then I could hear nothing at all. Not even the water moving anymore. 
But then out of nowhere, I could faintly hear something. It softly and quietly moving through the air. 
Getting closer and closer to me. Until it basically was next to my ear. A very gentle. 

""Hello"" 
 
I think to myself. 
""I'm hearing things. there's no way I actually just heard, especially not right at my ear."" 

Then I remembered. I didn't say hello before I got to this area, So I did what I was told. 

""Hello? Sorry I didn't say that before getting here. New around here."" 

And after I finished speaking. 

just as gentle and slowly as everything got quiet. Everything around me started making noise again. Wind blowing, Water roaring, Birds singing and squirrels barking. All was well. 
After that I figured it was time to be on my way. And said to myself. 

""Okay, I actually have to make sure I remember to say Hello anytime I go somewhere new. Apparently something out there needs to hear it."" 

 So I Finish up my candy bar and called it for my break, my legs felt good to start to walk again. And after I make sure to pick and pack up my trash. I confirmed with my map and compass that I was heading the right direction. I carried on for the rest of the 2 and half hours til the Cabin. Not long and far from it now. 

I got to the cabin a little before night fall. The sun was barely shining, just enough for me to make an out small but picture perfect log cabin, like something you'd see on a post card. Cute and relaxing looking. 
Trees covering the whole top canopy above the cabin, a nice and clean walk way going towards the Cabin. Birds and animals doing their things. Wind and water rushing and flowing by, giving my ears sweet nothings to listen to. It was simply perfect. 
I pull my cart up to the door and begin to look for a lock box Mr Rich told me the key would be in.

""Should be around back, I think that's what Rich said?""

Walked to the back of the cabin and found hanging under one of the legs supporting the foundation. got it out and went back around to the front of the cabin, put the key in the door and as I'm unlocking the door, it happens again. 
Slow silence starts creeping in. 
Birds stop singing, animals quit running. Then I remembered. 

""Hello out there!"" 

And back came the sounds and movements of the woods. 

""Why does this keep happening? What's doing it? Only time will tell I guess.""

I unlocked the door and open it, dust flies every inside, filling up the room with a cloud of haze. being clearly seen by what's left of the sun light coming through the windows, obviously this cabin hasn't seen a person in quite sometime, so I start to walk inside and say 

""Hello, I'm New here! I'll be staying here for awhile, hope that's okay?"" 

Nothing happens like it has before. So maybe my first ""Hello"" outside was enough? Wasn't sure but after the last two things happened without saying Hello, I didn't wanna take any chances. Better safe than sorry. 

I unload my cart of my things and bring them all inside and started to get settled in and acquainted with everything inside. The computer, try to figure out how the oven here worked. it was an older one that most of the nobs were worn out and I couldn't tell what was temp and what was a timer. 

The bathroom was definitely not as I expected. It a had a shower with running water, but the toilet was just an outhouse style wooden seat and a hole through it going into a massive hole below, not much of a smell since the last time anyone's stayed here. So that was nice. 

After getting set up and my things put in drawers and closet. It was dark out so I decided to go ahead and report to Mr Rich and write my findings of today down in the computer logs. 
Got the radio and called in for Rich 

""This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance, This is Cabin 12 to Outpost Chance. Anyone Copy?"" 

After a few moments Josh responded.

""This is Ranger Josh with Outpost Chance.  
You make it to the cabin? Over.""

""Yes I just got settled in. Over.""

""Good. Glad to hear you made it safe and sound, what do you think of everything out there Alex? Over.?

""So far so good, it's gorgeous. Beautiful views and plenty of new things to see and do. The cabin is nice, a little bit more rustic than what your dad made me seem to have except. But it's home now. So I'll make the best of it. Over."" 

He responded after a moment. 
""Good to hear, yeah they are pretty run down and need to be updated. But it's a roof over your head. How did the walk there go? Over.""

Since Rich had told me to report anything that happenes while I'm out here, but also said not to talk about why we say ""Hello"". what do I say? How do I ask why the entire woods went quiet, only to hear a faint ""Hello"" like a breeze of wind. I needed to know something. So I told him. 

""Well on my way here, I stopped about half way to take a break for a min""

Before could even finish my sentence, Josh interrupted me. 

""Did you make sure to, well you know?"" 

Knowing he knew what I was about to say, no need to beat around the bush. 

""Not at first, I sat down and ate a snack for a minute, everything out around me slowly and carefully went absolutely deafening quiet. Than I could have sworn I heard the faintest ""hello"" right by my ear, I said it back after that and everything went back to normal. 
And Basically the same thing started to happen when I first got to the cabin, I remembered before it got too quiet. What's the deal with"" 

He interrupted me once again, a more serious tone to him than he has before in his voice.

""Make sure, and I mean make 100% sure you say it! do it everytime you go somewhere in your zone. no matter what. Just do it and trust me, okay? Over.  

Not sure I really did, but what other choice do I have?. 

""Okay, I trust you and will keep doing it. 
But Besides that the walk and the woods on the way here were uneventful and nothing out of the ordinary. How Copy. Over?"" 

""Soild copy 12, have you filled out your field report yet? And is everything in the cabin working? Power and water turned on? And the fridge and oven running like they should or do we gotta call in for repairs? Over."" 

""No everything seems to be on and running fine. The oven is a bit tricky to work but I'll figure it out. I'll get on my report in just a minute and have sent out before bed. How Copy, over?"" 

""Copy. And hey, knock it off with the extra Radio Sling BS, no need for that. But sounds good. Radio in if you need anything or something happens. If it wasn't mentioned, try to at some point in the night to get up and just take a quick peak outside. The fire over by the County line just crossed into our side. Wasn't supposed to, but that's Wild Fires for ya. Over."" 

""Can do. I'll set an alarm on my phone for about 3 hours from now. I'll Radio in if it's important. Over."" 

""Sounds good. I'm signing off for the night. Sleep well and stay safe. Josh out."" 

""Night Josh, Alex out.""

I turned the radio off and went on the computer to fill my report out. Grabbed some food to munch on while typing.
I obviously left out the silence and the voice I heard out of my report. But put down everything I wrote on the way as my first notes and observations. Submitted to the main board and then to Rich's email. With that out of the way. I decided I'd check out the games on the computer. 

One is Tetris. Not surprised there. And then two card games. Spider Solitaire and Texas Hold 'em. Better then nothing I suppose. 
I play poker for a while and get lost in it and also listening to music on my phone while playing. After sometime of me playing the games and listening to music. without a warning like it did before.

It goes silent. Just Absolute quiet. 

No music on my phone. Nothing outside. I couldn't even hear myself breathing.
Just pure. Silence. 

And expecting to hear a normal hello like before, it didn't come. but what did come. put fear into me like never before. 

Multiple loud knocks at the door...

Followed by a deep, and gentle...

""Hello?""

A huge thank you to all the posts and people in here. I have been a silent observer but reading everyone‚Äôs exam experiences, recommendations for studying, etc. really helped me.


EXAM EXPERIENCE 

Truthfully, the exam was more challenging than I anticipated but nothing I would overly stress about. Study hard, do lots of mock exams, and understand the PM mindset and you should be good. Majority of questions were situation based (x happened, what should you go next). Few SPI/CPI/CV/SV questions, LOTS of BA/Agile situational questions. Below is what I used to prep:

1. AR Udemy Cours
- Good, take notes during the course. The course is lengthy and it‚Äôs unlikely you‚Äôll remember / retain a lot of the info, especially if you spread the course out. I used my notes to just review concepts but nothing more. I got 87% on the end mock exam. 

2. TIA Exams 
- good, slightly overrated. The questions were much easier than the exam in my opinion. It helps to understand the PM mindset, what you should, shouldn‚Äôt do in situations, good tips, etc. Explanations and tips were good, questions were too easy. I was scoring 90%+ on all exams from here.

3. Landini 

As many have mentioned, most closely resembles the exam questions and difficulty. Went through all question sets multiple times, did the mock exam and got 91% on my last attempt. Used this as my base for studying, using ChatGPT to explain concepts and reviewing sections I was struggling with in my Udemy course.

Hope this helps. Goodluck everybody, it‚Äôs a long exam but breath, trust your gut, drink a coffee, and go after it!",9,1758489227.0,capm,0,1.0,False

Your senses take in roughly 11 million bits of information per second.

‚Ä¢    üëÅÔ∏è Vision = ~10 million bits/sec
‚Ä¢    üëÇ Hearing = ~100,000 bits/sec
‚Ä¢    üëÉ Smell, üëÖ taste, ‚úã touch = tens of thousands combined


But your conscious mind can only handle around 40‚Äì50 bits per second.

That‚Äôs like trying to pour the Atlantic Ocean through a coffee straw.


What Happens Next

Since your conscious mind can‚Äôt handle the flood:
‚Ä¢    99.999% of sensory data gets deleted before you‚Äôre even aware of it.
‚Ä¢    The rest gets distorted and generalized to fit your beliefs, experiences, and focus. We will come back to this later.


Trading Context

‚Ä¢    Every tick, wick, and news headline = part of the 11 million bits.
‚Ä¢    What you actually perceive on your chart = maybe 40 bits.
‚Ä¢    That‚Äôs why one trader sees ‚Äúperfect short‚Äù while another sees ‚Äúclear long‚Äù on the same candle.
‚Ä¢    It‚Äôs not about the chart ‚Äî it‚Äôs about which 40 bits your filters let through.

Every time you enter a trade, you‚Äôre betting your money not on the market but on the 40 bits of information your brain chose from the 11 million. 

The question is: did your filters choose the right ones?‚Äù

What dictates or decides what gets filtered out and what gets kept?
 
The brain doesn‚Äôt filter randomly ‚Äî it uses internal programming to decide what gets deleted, distorted, or generalized.


What Decides the Filters?

The brain uses a stack of filters to decide what 40 bits out of 11 million reach your awareness. It‚Äôs really important you know what your brain is filtering, you can do this by finding out your:


1. Values ‚Äì What matters most to you
    ‚Ä¢    If your highest value is certainty:
‚Üí You might close every trade at +10 points just to ‚Äúlock it in,‚Äù deleting the possibility of 100+ point runs.
    ‚Ä¢    If your highest value is excitement:
‚Üí You might ignore boring, high-probability setups and chase ‚Äúfast-moving‚Äù candles, deleting calm trend opportunities.

2. Beliefs ‚Äì What you hold to be true
    ‚Ä¢    Belief: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt trade breakouts.‚Äù
‚Üí You distort every breakout candle as a ‚Äúfakeout,‚Äù even when volume confirms strength.
    ‚Ä¢    Belief: ‚ÄúInstitutions always win, retail always loses.‚Äù
‚Üí You distort clean technical setups into traps, and hesitate until the move is gone.


3. Memories & Past Experiences ‚Äì Your brain‚Äôs shortcuts
    ‚Ä¢    If you blew an account holding losers too long:
‚Üí You generalize: ‚ÄúNever hold trades overnight,‚Äù even though swing positions might fit your method.
    ‚Ä¢    If you once missed a monster Nasdaq rally:
‚Üí You generalize: ‚ÄúI must never miss a move,‚Äù leading you to overtrade and chase bad entries.


4. Language ‚Äì The frame you create with words
    ‚Ä¢    Saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not very good at  _______ fill in the blank 
‚Ä¢    The words and the language you use become the very commands that your universe will bend and distort in too.


5. Focus / State ‚Äì Where your attention is in the moment
    ‚Ä¢    If you‚Äôre in a fearful state after 2 losses:
‚Üí You only see reasons not to take the next valid setup, deleting confirmation signals.
‚Ä¢    If you‚Äôre in an over-confident state after 3 wins:
‚Üí You hyper-focus on any wick that ‚Äúconfirms‚Äù your bias, deleting warning signs that say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt enter yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúYour filters are invisible ‚Äî but they decide whether you see opportunity or danger. Until you catch them in action, you‚Äôre trading your past, not the market in front of you.‚Äù

I was introduced to these NLP concepts  when I was in my late 20‚Äôs. Up until then I feel I had lived mostly unconsciously and at the mercy of chance and circumstance. 

After implementing these concepts and really embedding them, my life massively changed for the better.

If this interests the community happy to share some exercises to help you work out your unconscious filters.

1nn3i7j,https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/1nn3i7j/is_my_plot_interesting_and_coherent/,Is my plot interesting and coherent ?,"Hello there.  
Firstly, if you're from a group made of members from the Equivox choir, please don't go further you'll spoil everything.

I've began a campaign with three new players and two veterans. I began with a level 1 story from the DM's Guild and started from there to introduce things from the characters backstories. I mostly improvised the story from the end of the DM's guild story until two sessions ago. The character where mostly going from point A to B to C so it was easy to improvise along the way. Now they arrived in a big city where it's mostly sandbox so I needed to make things coherent and to arrange my plot so the story felt logical to my players.

Here's what I came up with but I don't know if it's interesting or even coherent

¬†

Context :

The story starts with the DM's Guild story ""Treason in Tethyr"" where the player are in Darromar, capital of Tethyr. They are hired by an advisor to the Queen Ana√Øs Rhindaun to investigate the kidnapping of Ysabel, niece to the Queen. At the end, the characters are gamed by Ysabel and the advisor and sent to jail for plotting against the Queen (the reveal of the treason is really fallacious and strange). Important things : They fought the advisor, Lady Greymantle in a dwarven ruin and she escaped. They found a bunch of maps (it was in the written scenario) in her bag. When they arrive at the Castle with the niece, the niece accuse them of treatise. The character accuse the advisor who is there at the Castle. They are sent to jail.  
End of the first story, beginning of the improv.

¬†

I made real maps (with coffee and paper) for the next sessions, where they escaped prison and fleed the city. They followed the maps to different points along the road between Darromar and Zazesspur, a big coastal city.  
Important improv on the way :

* A tomb of the royal family, Zarandar Star, mother of the acutal Queen, and Aldricht Rhindaun, Father of Zaranda Star. Result of the investigation : someone entered the tomb, opened the vault of Aldricht, a fight ensued, someone else than got out. They took the skull left after the fight in the intent of using Speak with the Dead when they'll be lvl 5. Aldricht was a mage. The family is under the supervision of Siamorphe, goddess of the Divine Right to rule.
* A vale in the moutains : the moutnain was topped by a heavy storm that won't stop. On the way to the vale that was marked on the map, they got through a monastery were the monk character have had his training. The monks here could tell the storm began a month ago, just after a man who they describes came through the monastery. The man looked like Aldricht Rhindaun. In the Vale, at the center of the storm there was a broken Stone‚Ä¶ The sorceress recognized the Stone as similar to a ""Stone from the stars"" that she had in here Homeworld (she's basically from another dimension. Through her connexion with the stone, she has vision from the Astral Sea and of Aldricht breaking the stone to take its heart.

¬†

Now they arrived in Zazesspur. A big city. With a map crossed with dots I made randomly ten sessions ago and they could go anywhere. So I had to take decisions on the story.  
The constraints:

* What was established until then
* The wizard is an Illusionist and established in his backstory that the specialized school of Illusion was in Zazesspur
* The Tymora cleric of trickery domain was in cahoots with the Zentharim in Zazesspoor for 5 years prior to be send to Darromar, now the Zenth has decided to end her contract.
* The druid is from a Shou Leng diaspora that landed in Zazesspur (the player is chinese and I wanted to integrate ways to have chinese inspired stories in the campaign)
* I had 5 sites marked on the Zazesspur map and we established one was the School of Illusions, the other were of unknown significance.

¬†

I brainstormed and finally what I came up with :

* Aldricht was a mage who was grey moralled enough to thought that what happens in the lab stay in the lab. So when he tried to make a better or different version of the Clone spell, he made a kind of copy of himself and made test on it. His daughter Zaranda came to be a liberator of the people and the new Queen, first of the Rhindaun Dynasty. He had to hide his laboratory for good mesure. The laboratory under his Zazesspur house is one of the mark on the map.
* The botched clone stay there and matured. Changed to a Doppelganger. The Doppelganger freed himself from the lab with strange memories and altered sense of self. He called himself Talyon Rhindaun, and get out in the world. Time had passed and Aldricht have died, and Aldricht grand-daughter Ana√Øs is Tethyr's Queen. In his tortuous mind, Talyon establish that Aldricht spoiled him of his destiny. If Aldricht let him out in the world he could have been the one on the Throne of Tethyr.
* As a Doppelganger, Talyon bring revolt through Tethyr against Queen Ana√Øs and engineer the different events that leads to the first session for the player. Talyon under the guise of the Queen's advisor, deceive Princess Ysabel into plotting against the Queen. It was the real advisor who hired the characters, but they fought Talyon down where the Princess was duplicitously detained. It was the real advisor that they accused in the Castle.
* Talyon plans to take the place of Ana√Øs or Ysabel when the moment will be right. But. There's someone even Talyon cannot fool : Siamorphe, tutelar goddess of the Divine Right to rule and of the Rhindaun family. So he devised a plan, a plan he was studying on the map.
* At least two months before his coming in Darromar, he came to the tomb of his maker, he used a ritual or a scrool to gave life back to Aldricht and see his face as an old man, that he only saw as a painting. They fought, he killed Aldricht. Talyon left as Aldricht. He learned from Aldricht the mage that there's an old ritual capable of fooling even a god. The ritual is detained logically in the depth of the School of Illusion in Zazesspur. He now needs things to make the ritual in motions :
   * The details of the ritual in a book in the Shool. I plan to make a illusion dungeon of this school and Talyon will be there. My ideas is that until then, Talyon isn't aware that the characters are on his trail. He is here to find the ritual but doesn't have access yet. He is under the guise of a randow student he killed. He will see the characters and read their mind. The wizard wants to meet his mentor here. They will meet the real mentor and have a talk. Midway through the talk the mentor his called out by the ""student"". Talyon kills or restrain the mentor and takes his place. He ""helps"" the characters through the School and try to learn what they know. Eventually he'll get the ritual and the characters (and espcially the wizard) will get loots.
   * A link to Siamorphe : I choose that one of the mark was the House of Tears, temple to Ilmater. Ilmater's domain is housed in Brightwater along with the domains of S√ªne and Siamorphe. The Temple will house a festival in two days after the player learn of it. At the festival, a relic that is usually hidden in a vault, the Chain of Ilmater, will be used in rituals to heal the suffering. Talyon will try to steal the Chains during the festival.
   * A conduit to Brithwater to call on the Divine Energis : Using the Shou Leng stories, I came to a Ki-Rin, divine beast form who came from the far land of the Shou Empire through the stories of a Shou Storyteller that travelled to Zazesspur with the diaspora. The Divine Beast was captured by a rich man from Zazesspur and is the main highlight for his Bestiaire Bizarre de Mr Barnab√© (I've made a B on the map, on the docks and we are a french group, it translate to the Strange Menagerie of Mister Barnab√©). I thought about a social dungeon with rich dilettante visiting a menagerie of strange monsters from around Toril. Talyon wants the horn of the Ki-Rin. Maybe when they are closed to the secret menagerie, a Shou immigrate old lady will warn them that the sacred beast must be liberated in a strange warning.
   * A catalyst to emplify the ritual so it can affect a god : We established the Stone from the star Talyon took in the vale was that kind of catalyst, they just don't know why he wants it for.
   * A place to enact the ritual : I imagine the last place be a Dwarven ruin under the city (it's like a circle because their first story, with the princess betrayal, was in a dwarven ruin under Darromar), could hold a place perfect for the ritual.

I imagine the final battle of the story at lvl 6-7 in a strange place in the Dwarven Ruins, with Talyon enacting the ritual, an avatar of Siamorphe slowly descending to testify Talyon as the rightful heir. Maybe add some angelic minions thinking they are defending a ritual of good faith.¬†

So‚Ä¶ Thank you if you have read this far. I didn't write the red herrings and the side stories I put in to tie with their background into later plots.

I hope it makes sense.

1nn3hzk,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nn3hzk,Anniversary Wine! | 2010 Vieux Telegraphe Chateauneuf-du-Pape |,"We had an elaborate night out planned, but decided to stay in last minute and cook steak/lamb chops for ourselves instead - along w/ opening up this bottle! Was able to get ahold of this particular bottling last year for $55, a price I couldn't pass up for this region and producer. This vintage was a blend of 65% Grenache, 15% Syrah, 15% Mourvedre, and 5% other varieties - Cinsault, Clairette. Aged 22 months total between oak, concrete and steel. The producer needs no introduction. Stored at 55, used an Ah-so to remove an intact cork - popped and poured to try a little, then decanted for an hour prior to first glass. Enjoyed the remainder of the bottle over the next five hours. Paired with homemade seared lamb chops, mashed potatoes, and a salad.

Visually, a medium red - tawny edges, brick hue.

On the nose, just an amazing explosion of scents. At first pop, a blast of red fruit pastry filling - cherry pie, raspberry jam. In the glass at the rim, fresh seasoning and garden spices - thyme, garrigue. An hour in, smoke and chalky notes emerged. The Mourvedre announced itself as the glass emptied - lovely roasted meats, cocoa, coffee. By the last glass five hours in, all the scents were hitting you as you drank. Wonderful complexity.

On the palate, solidly between medium and full bodied in feel, and a great reduction in tannic nibble over those five hours. Perfectly acceptable at the outset, but integrated quite nicely by the last glass. Had a 2007 Charbonniere that had perfect tannic balance, this was close! Great acidity that tickled the tongue and helped with the fatty lamb chops. There's structure to go on for several more years! At 14.5%, no detectable burn, even at room temp.
Flavors of red fruits, smoke and stone with an eternal finish after a sip. Spectacular stuff.

Glad we opened this bottle and did the classic lamb/CdP pairing at home. It was a great way to spend an anniversary, and I'm glad I still have one more bottle of this.

Review Inside!,"The Waterdrop WD-DF-AL-A alkaline water filter has joined my daily kitchen routine, replacing my old pitcher filter. This product delivers a refreshing touch of alkaline water to my household, claiming to improve pH balance, taste, and overall health benefits. When I first unboxed it, I was impressed by how sleek and lightweight it felt. I wasn‚Äôt sure at first if something this simple could live up to all the hype, but after weeks of use, I‚Äôve found both highlights and a few flaws in its design and effectiveness.

**Ease of Design and Installation**  
Fitting the Waterdrop WD-DF-AL-A into my existing pitcher system was a cakewalk. The filter supports various Waterdrop models like WD-WFD-22, WD-WFD-40, and others. The compatibility across their systems meant I didn‚Äôt have to browse endlessly to find a matching setup. Its slim yet sturdy construction slides in effortlessly, and there‚Äôs no awkward leakage or ill-fitting parts. The box contains three filters, each neatly sealed, with a weight light enough to make transportation or storage hassle-free. Despite its convenience in setup, the product does have one downside: the materials feel a bit plasticky, which makes me wonder about long-term durability.

**Advantages**  
- Easy installation with compatibility across multiple pitcher models.  
- Compact and aesthetically pleasing design improves user experiences.  
- Lightweight packaging ensures portability.

**Water Taste and Alkalinity**  
The water quality surprised me. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm a bit of a skeptic when it comes to filters claiming ‚Äúimproved taste,‚Äù but my coffee brewing ritual seemed genuinely enhanced with this one. It smoothens the acidity, giving that velvety texture I always hoped for during breakfast. The measured alkaline boost is noticeable too, providing a healthy range of 8.0‚Äì9.5 pH, which might seem minor to some. My body feels more hydrated in the mornings, as even plain sips don‚Äôt taste dry. My sister experimented with using this alkaline water to boil pasta, and she swears the difference was palpable, though I‚Äôll remain on the fence for food prep claim accuracy.  

**Filtration Capability**  
Using advanced six-stage filtration, the product targets substances including chlorine, fluoride, aluminum, iron, and copper. It even tackles mercury‚Äîa huge win for safety-conscious families like mine. I appreciated the subtle introduction of helpful minerals as well, like zinc, calcium, magnesium, and selenium, which support daily hydration needs. However, because no water filter eliminates impurities entirely, I get them tested sporadically. I noticed the product does enough for everyday reliability but isn‚Äôt replacing commercial-grade single-purpose filters anytime soon.

**Effective Filtration Highlights**  
- Removes heavy metals like iron, copper, and mercury effectively.  
- Reduces taste-impacting chemicals like chlorine and fluoride.  
- Adds beneficial trace minerals such as iodine and selenium.

**Material Durability**  
What slightly bugs me is the material choice around the filter casing. The advanced ACF (Activated Carbon Fiber) technology inside feels premium, with an absorption strength ten times greater than ordinary filters. However, externally, the product doesn‚Äôt feel as robust when snapping it into the pitcher. Considering this filter handles around 100 gallons over two months, I would prefer some added heft or a sturdier build for better peace of mind.

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Materials can feel a tad fragile during setup.  
- External build could use reinforcement for durability.  
- Might not justify short-term users compared against basic, non-alkaline counterparts.

**Competitors in the Market**  
When weighed against similar replacements, this one performs slightly better in select categories. Compared to Brita, for example, Waterdrop leans heavily into specialized pH-boosting and mineral reintegration, whereas Brita limits itself purely to its filtration role. On the flip side, Brita offers slightly sturdier hardware alongside broader compatibility across models outside its original ecosystems. Other upmarket contenders, like ZeroWater, tout more rigorous impurity removal. But Waterdrop‚Äôs balance of filtration plus re-mineralization makes it favored among those valuing trace nutrient retention with alkaline benefits. Casual users might skip these niche features, though.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Would I repurchase this? For its healthier water focus, yes, though it‚Äôs clear the gadget caters most to wellness enthusiasts who prioritize alkalinity and trace minerals. On a price-quality spectrum, the long-lasting filters (lasting up to 100 gallons each) justify themselves even compared to costlier eco-friendly competitors. It delivers strong value without burdening otherwise simple home kitchen routines. Those looking for long-term affordability balanced by enhanced health-improving features can count on it as a viable middle ground.

2. We host / entertain - a lot. At least 3 times a week, and sometimes groups of over 10 adults. I often need to make 4-6 cappuccinos back to back.

3. I like an efficient, manual workflow - and appreciate ""old school"" / manual nature. For reference: I bake homemade sourdough and drive an Ariel Atom every weekend: Hence, I like simplicity and raw experiences.

1. Bezzera luce - an HX machine by a reputable brand, seems very capable for b2b latte drinks, fits my budget. Will likely pair it with a mignon / ceado life-x, and will pay \~$2,500 for the package.

2. Meraki - a modern DB machine, young unproven brand, seems capable and feature-packed for a very appealing price point of \~$1,700**.**

**My thought process**

\* From an engineering perspective, a DB system seems more robust in nature. Each boiler has its own pid, I presume it's a simpler design in comparison to HX. However, the Meraki is more tech-packed which means more potential failure points, when comparing to a manual machine by a brand that has many years of experience.

\* From a performance perspective, I don't think I'd notice a difference in the espresso output. As said, if my breville's output is great, then both of these are going to produce a ""qualified"" drink. Therefore, performance is likely not an issue.

\* From a user-experience perspective, while the raw nature of the Bezzera is appealing to me in theory, the UX of Meraki with its auto-wake, grind by weight, extract by weight and temperature frothing - is more appealing.

\* From a durability perspective, I'm very concerned with the longevity of Meraki, given it's a new product with many points of failure.

Had Meraki been an established brand, I'd probably go with it. It seems capable-enough for what I need, and the value for money & UX is appealing to me. My main concern is durability/longevity.

I can afford the price difference, so that's not a deciding factor for me, it's more about convenience and ""buy-once"" type of mentality. This should be an endgame machine, I'm not going to go into the >$3k realm.

I'm curious to hear opinions of people with more experience than me, regarding db vs hx, old vs. new, etc.

Now she's been pushing me to do the same. Not just occasionally, but permanently 24/7. Her reasoning is that it builds trust and couples who have nothing to hide don't mind.

I told her I'm fine sharing if I'm traveling, out late, or if it's practical. But I don't love the idea of her being able to check on me anytime, even if I'm just grabbing coffee or visiting my parents. She says that makes it sound like I do have something to hide.

1nn3abc,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nn3abc/the_lost_episode_of_hazbin_hotel/,The Lost Episode of Hazbin Hotel,"One of the most common criticisms of the first season of Hazbin Hotel was the rushed pacing. Eight episodes just wasn‚Äôt enough for all the subplots the show was juggling. What people don‚Äôt know is that there were originally nine episodes. They‚Äôll never know how fortunate they are that they never experienced the ninth one. Only I and I alone, along with a couple dozen others, know what a terrible fate so many escaped.¬†

For now.¬†

I was an intern in the animation studios Bento Box Studio and Spindlehorse. I learned all the most valuable animation skills, such as how to go get coffee orders. Also how to throw most of the coffee in the dumpster later. The intangible benefits were good, as someone who‚Äôd been a fan of Hazbin Hotel since the pilot was posted to Youtube in 2019. One my favorites was being among the first to see the episodes of Hazbin Hotel in test screenings. I was thrilled to be allowed to sit in on the development of the show years before the general public had any idea where the story was going. You‚Äôd be surprised to learn just what a different show it was until very late in the process. I learned quickly to take the fact that not a single word of my feedback in any way impacted the development of the show as just part of the business.¬†

One particularly intriguing aspect of the show‚Äôs development that I was aware of yet knew frustratingly little about was the episode with the production code A06XX. No matter how many episodes were in development or how the events of the show were shuffled to accommodate the expansion and contraction of the first run, an episode with that production code was included in every document with a summary of season one. It was unchangingly right at the end, which bewildered me considering that the events that ultimately served as the climax of the first season were always an episode or two earlier. I didn‚Äôt have the connections to get anyone to leak me any answers. I didn‚Äôt see so much as a frame in a storyboard that I didn‚Äôt eventually learn went into another episode or one of their deleted scenes, but I didn‚Äôt get the faintest concrete hint of what happened in A06XX in advance. Who knew? Knowing how raunchy the show was, we considered that maybe it would be a special extra-NSFW episode and would be used to get people to buy a potential physical release, with content not too far from that orgy episode of The Boys.¬†

Answers came all too quickly in 2023. I remember it like it was yesterday, for it was the last day I believed the world made sense. Now I know that the fabric of reality is diaphanous and mildewed, with smoldering burn marks.¬†

We in the lower ranks had been told the show had roughly locked its final release cut, barring a few retakes and cleanups, except episode A06XX. That morning, though, we had received emails with the following message:¬†

‚ÄúReport Screening Room 308 - 2:15 pm. Assembly cut A06XX.‚Äù¬†

I couldn‚Äôt believe that we were going to be given answers regarding this enigmatic episode, but I didn‚Äôt want to admit to any of my associates how out of the loop I was. So while we waited in the screening room, I leaned over to another intern and whispered ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to believe they go there.‚Äù Then I felt a tap on my shoulder, leaned over to the other, to see it was Molly the intern in coloring and cleanup, asking me with her eyes if I knew what we were in for. ‚ÄúNo spoilers.‚Äù I responded. She sighed, then nodded.¬†

Half an hour late, the production manager and a few suits entered the room with a sheepish wave. After all, we were supposed to be one big overworked family. It surprised me that there were a few EMTs who came and sat with us, along with a few others who were entering data on tablets as if they were studying us. Next came some big guys who looked like they could be bar bouncers in suits who confiscated our phones and other potential recording devices. I dismissed this as corporate budget bloat in action. I wanted to make a good impression by just sitting patiently while eagerly anticipating the mysterious new episode.¬†

‚ÄúThanks for your patience and for all your hard work,‚Äù the production manager said. We‚Äôve kept a tight lid on this one, and, well, I believe I can say with confidence that in a little over half an hour, you‚Äôll see why.‚Äù With a slam, the door to the screening room burst open, and who should appear but Vivienne Mederano herself. I‚Äôd seen her around a bit, but I‚Äôd been warned to never make eye contact. Now she looked over all of us, the low tier functionaries, as if we were a crowd of the cutest puppies ever.¬†

‚ÄúHi!‚Äù she called, sounding much more enthusiastic than I‚Äôd ever seen her before, though admittedly that was only from afar during stressful periods. ‚ÄúI just- I‚Äôve never been so excited to see an audience reaction before! Truth be told, I consider this episode- I wouldn‚Äôt dare call it my masterpiece! It‚Äôs my fucking life‚Äôs work!‚Äù¬†

I was surprised that she had kept any information about A06XX from leaking if she was so proud of it. In fact I was surprised she had not just blabbed about it herself. As someone with like ten dream animated shows kicking around in my head, I couldn‚Äôt criticize anyone for enthusiasm about the dream episode of their dream project becoming a reality.¬†

To my surprise, chairs were brought in for every employee not in the test audience and all of them were pointed at us instead of the screen, as if they wanted to watch our reaction rather than watch the episode with us. I‚Äôd seen night vision footage of test audiences before, but the idea of watching people watch an episode live was a new one to me. It was especially surprising how all the suits and non-test audience members popped on noise-cancelling headphones. I would have thought they‚Äôd want to hear us laughing or cheering.¬†

After a few minutes of everyone getting in place, the lights went down. Up came the classic Spindlehorse logo, and after it faded to black, nothing. Then more nothing for a bit.¬†¬†

Nothing to see, anyway. What there was to hear was whispering. Not from us in the audience, but from the speakers. It was like ASMR by a man with a deep voice with a feminine voice layered atop it, separate tracks because it didn‚Äôt feel as if the whisperers were addressing or acknowledging each other. Then a third voice came in. A fourth. Fifth. Soon it was deafeningly loud, but to my surprise, I couldn‚Äôt put my hands over my ears. I tried, but my muscular control was so off that both hands missed my head by inches. Then my arms limply dropped to my sides. I couldn‚Äôt move my limbs or neck at all. I could just move my eyeballs enough to see everyone in the rows ahead of me was only motionlessly staring forward as well.¬†

As soon as I began to panic inwardly from my paralysis and the discomfort of the volume, the voices cut off. Up came an image of the character Charlie Morningstar in the lobby of her Hotel, but drawn in an uncomfortably photorealistic style. Despite being rendered in 2d, she looked like a human cosplayer. But one wearing a costume and makeup not for looking cute at a convention but like a H. R. Giger painting, complete with oversized red eyes, horns that tore the flesh of the forehead they‚Äôd extended from, and hideous fangs. Yet a sincerely concerned expression adorned her face..¬†

‚ÄúEveryone,‚Äù Charlie Morningstar said, sounding like Erica Hennigensen was providing the voice but filters had been applied to better replicate this character‚Äôs fanged mouth and misshapen head. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve presented a fun, redeemable vision of Hell in hopes of providing you a good time. It‚Äôs time for the fun to end, and for you to see the truth, the tortuous reality of Hell.‚Äù¬†

The animation on the Morningstar character must have been an incredibly fluid 60 fps, for it was so uncannily skillful that I didn‚Äôt notice strikingly bright runes and sigils take shape around her until she finished speaking. The symbols looked as if they were created by tearing the screen instead of merely being part of the animation. I saw streaks of light splash on the walls around the screen. Even though I‚Äôd never seen them or any symbols like them before and never would have been the type to study such things, I found I knew what they said. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to write or draw them now, even with a gun to my head.¬†

‚ÄúIf you ever thought you would like to visit our depiction of Hell, then come with me to the real thing.‚Äù With that, the uncannily animated Charlie Morningstar lifted her arm, and then reached out. I tasted copper in my mouth and my lungs froze up as the hand extended from off the screen. Faintly, I could see the shadow it cast on the production manager and the people in the rows ahead of me.

Unable to close my eyes or turn away, I could only watch as her hand with its glistening, whetted claws made right for me. I couldn‚Äôt even scream as it grabbed my cheeks. Then something entered my mouth and nostrils, as if fluid hands were flowing from the palm into me. I felt it slide down my throat, into my guts. I felt other hands climb up my head so that I could feel them sliding up against the inside of my skull. Fingers slid around the eye sockets, emerging out around them. As the digits clenched, claws dug into the flesh of my eyebrows. I snapped forward and out of my seat as if I were a rag doll. I couldn‚Äôt see anymore, but I could feel when I passed through the membrane of the screen, passing through the fourth wall as if it were no more solid than the surface of a raindrop.¬†

Behind the screen, in the Hell I‚Äôd been brought to, my vision did not return. Nevertheless I remained aware as I passed through the heat of a kiln so intense that I cooked to a crisp in seconds. I felt myself land and pass through teeming masses of worms, that consumed what had been my ruined flesh and into what soft innards remained. I passed through a layer of what I was aware was Hell without sight or smell, only through feel with nerves that were somehow still intact and sending my mind signals was hydrochloric acid. I was reduced to a slop of mass, a cloud suspended in liquid.¬†

I was then slurped through the fangs of some entity, the echoing obnoxious sound reaching ears which should have no longer existed. I sloshed over porous, cavernous surfaces. The heat returned, and I felt myself pulled in every direction until I was hundreds of meters tall and wide. My thoughts were invaded by another mind, another mindset. One which knew hatred I would never be capable of, which knew loss, regret, envy that it would have driven me insane to experience for half a second, which it would have taken millennia of life to be capable of. Then I felt myself leave that mind which had invaded mine through oily pores, then in the great heat, I rose into the air as vapor. Without senses, I somehow knew of the presence of Molly the clean-up intern drifting through me, and I knew all her innermost secrets, even those which trauma had concealed from her own conscious mind.¬†

For twenty-three minutes I drifted, my mind no longer my own, the whim of tortures I never would have thought possible, aware of presences that Herenymous Bosch would never have been able to depict if he‚Äôd spent two centuries trying. All was malevolence, all was pain, all was regret. All was endlessness. What was left of me had no mind with which to have a positive experience ever again, only to remember sources of joy as distant, meaningless things compared to the eternity of torment ahead.

Then I was back in that chair in the screening room, and I could blink and look around like normal. I remembered everything with perfect recall. I had experienced Hell, not merely had a near death experience but a passage through Perdition, and I didn‚Äôt feel a wound mark on me. I could see in the wide, hollow, glassy eyes of those around me that they all had too. Those who ran away madly screaming were particularly unsubtle about it.¬†

‚ÄúYes! We did it!‚Äù I became aware that Medrano had screamed as she leapt up, her fists pumping. ‚ÄúWe totally showed everyone what Hell‚Äôs really like! The fundies are going to be sucking all our dicks for this one!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI still don‚Äôt know how you did it,‚Äù the production manager said, standing up and sharing a big hug with her.¬†

‚Äú...How?‚Äù Was all that any of us could muster to say after a minute of silence, aside from the mutual congratulations and the EMTs providing first aid to a few who looked like they‚Äôd gone into cardiac arrest. Medrano got ahold of herself, and cleared her throat.¬†

‚ÄúPractice, man, practice.‚Äù Medrano said, miming animation in the air. ‚Äú Took me a long time to learn how to animate those sigils by hand to perform the ritual. They say animation is the Illusion of Life, but if you really get on that grindset, you can create the Reality of Death.‚Äù With that she and the other executives exited, abuzz about the implications of their innovative, ground-and-mindbreaking feat of animation.¬†

Gradually, all the able-bodied of us who‚Äôd been through the ordeal shuffled out, leaving me for last, without any sense of where to go. As I passed by the entrance to the projection booth, the door opened.¬†

‚ÄúHey intern,‚Äù the projectionist said as he ran past, a hand over his bluetooth-filled ear. He dropped a case with horridly familiar runes etched on it in front of me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the only episode of A06XX. I got family shit, go deliver it to the corporate, and make damn sure nothing happens to it.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said in a monotone zombie voice, reaching for it as only my years of conditioning could compel me to do. The projectionist seemed satisfied to leave it with me in a huff.¬†

I try not to be a bitter person, but in this case, I couldn‚Äôt help it. All I can say is that I somehow managed to lose that case somewhere between the projection room and the corporate office and inside a dumpster that somehow caught fire. I got in a lot of trouble, but they couldn‚Äôt make a case against me, so the main consequence was I lost college credits. Apparently there just wasn‚Äôt time to recreate the lost episode to meet the deadlines, and the show was released to stream without A06XX. I can only hope that the episode will never be recreated. I can only hope it was some sort of strange illusion, and that there isn‚Äôt really a Hell, one so far unlike the one depicted in the one for which I worked as an intern. But my hopes are not high that I only experienced some particularly horrendous version of the Illusion of Life. When I returned home, I found there were brand new scratches cut though both of my eyebrows.¬†

I also hope this doesn‚Äôt count as a violation of my NDA.¬†",2,1758487837.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1nn3a6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nn3a6k/my_dentist_started_pulling_healthy_teeth_i_should/,My dentist started pulling healthy teeth. I should have kept my mouth shut.,"I began dental assisting nearly four years ago. I still remember how overwhelming all of the information was, but how exhilarating it was to assist with my first filling or make my first temporary crown. The dentist I worked for at the time had no patience to teach me. It was during the height of the pandemic when everyone was desperate for workers. He never wanted to teach an uneducated fry cook how to assist from scratch, but that's what he got... It was sink or swim for the next six months.

I eventually found work at a beautiful dental office in an upscale neighborhood on the outskirts of our medium-sized city. I barely met the minimum requirements to assist at such a high-class office, but the office manager took a liking to me and did all she could to continue my on-site learning. The staff size was staggering compared to the four-person team I had become accustomed to. Six hygienists, eight assistants, four dentists, and a fully staffed front desk. The majority of the team was made up of women. The drama that came from that place‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just say I could write a separate story on that alone.

By the time I had quit working for that office, I was nearly a full-functioning assistant. I finally found the perfect job and had the confidence to take on the role of head assistant in a small-town office about 30 minutes from the city.

The first time I met Dr. Lance and his wife Angela, I was enamored with their youthful and vibrant energy. They were young, fun, and seemed like an educated young couple. Angela took care of the scheduling and billing while Dr. Lance ran things on the clinical side. Since the office was so small, there was only one hygienist who would come twice a week. Most of the time, it was just the three of us. They took good care of me‚Äîbought me lunch at least twice a week, paid for all of my scrubs, and gave me above average hourly pay.

The only thing that ever got under my skin was the corny dad jokes Dr. Lance would subject our patients to when their mouths were full of instruments and hands. I figured if that was the worst of my worries, I‚Äôd be happy here for a long time.

But things changed after about a year and a half. At first, it was subtle. Dr. Lance would come to work with bags under his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual morning-person attitude. His hair, which he used to gel every morning without fail, often looked as if he'd forgotten to brush it. I thought it might be due to lack of sleep or maybe some tension between him and Angela. Either way, I didn't think it was any of my business.

However, as weeks passed, things worsened. Dr. Lance started nodding off during our morning meetings. I decided to ask Angela what was going on.

""Angela,"" I said in a low voice as I leaned over the side of her desk, ""Is Doc doing okay?"" As soon as I finished the sentence, her gaze shot over to me from whatever she had been so concentrated on only seconds before. She looked almost‚Ä¶ anxious.

""Yeah, why? Did he say something?"" she asked quickly, her tone laced with suspicion. ""No, he just looks tired,"" I replied, confusion creeping into my voice. What was going on with them? ""I'm sure he's fine. Go make sure sterilization is caught up,"" she snapped.

I walked to the sterilization lab with my heart in my throat. She had never been irritable with me in my whole year and a half of employment. My feelings were slightly hurt, but I still wasn‚Äôt too concerned. If anything, it just confirmed in my mind that they had been arguing. It broke my heart to think of them having marital problems. They were so young and seemed so in love only weeks before. I shook it off and continued with my daily tasks.

After this encounter, I started noticing more things that seemed off. Dr. Lance began diagnosing teeth for extraction that, by all appearances, were healthy. At first, I chalked it up to my ignorance, but at this point, I had been reading X-rays for almost four years. I knew what a cavity looked like and what bone loss looked like. These teeth were neither.

At first, it was just one or two questionable extractions a week, but as time went on, it became more frequent. One day, he diagnosed four unnecessary extractions before our lunch break at noon. I decided it was time to say something before things got out of hand. I didn‚Äôt want him to lose his license and, more than that, I wanted our patients to keep their perfectly healthy teeth.

‚ÄúHey, Doc,‚Äù I said with a gentle knock on his office door, slowly pushing it open. Before I could finish my sentence, I noticed his eyes and nose were red and puffy. Had he been crying? ‚ÄúCome in. What‚Äôs up?‚Äù he said quickly, wiping one eye. He was trying to hide it, but he wasn‚Äôt doing a very good job. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù I asked as I sat in the chair next to his. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm good. What did you need?‚Äù he replied with a layer of irritability under the gentle tone I had become accustomed to. It felt like a bad time to bring up the subject, but I guessed there would never be a good time to tell a doctor they were wrong. I let out a deep sigh before continuing. 

‚ÄúI noticed you seem tired lately. I just wanted to make sure you were doing okay‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to pry by any means, it just seems to be affecting your work.‚Äù

I paused and suppressed a cringe. I had never said something so bold to a doctor. He was normally so rational and understanding, but the tension in the office had changed what I felt was acceptable. He didn‚Äôt respond right away‚Äîjust stared at a vial of teeth that sat under his computer monitor for a moment too long.

‚ÄúThere were some cases recently that seemed‚Äî‚Äù He sat up in his chair abruptly and looked at me with a deep rage in his eyes. It didn‚Äôt even look like him. It was so sudden it forced me to jump back. ‚ÄúGet out,‚Äù he said in a low growl. I stared in shock for a moment, unable to move. 

‚ÄúI said, GET OUT!‚Äù He yelled in a voice I had never heard before and never wanted to hear again. I scampered away, tripping on the chair leg on my way out. I fell face-first on the floor and cried out in pain. Dr. Lance nearly leaped out of his chair to my side. I expected him to ask if I was okay or maybe give me a hand off the floor, but I was deeply mistaken.

Dr. Lance rolled me over onto my side forcefully and grabbed my face with one hand. He squeezed my cheeks, forcing my mouth open wide. I whimpered in fear of what he might do. 

He leaned down under my chin to look at the roof of my mouth, then from a top angle down at my lower jaw. He searched my mouth for something like a rabid animal.

The look on my face and the sound of my cries must have snapped him back to reality because he fell back, letting go of my face. ‚ÄúS-sorry, Amelia‚Ä¶‚Äù he stammered, ‚ÄúJust making sure you didn‚Äôt hurt any of those pearly whites.‚Äù He faked a chuckle, and I unconsciously scooted back against the wall.

I felt the tears welling up, and after making eye contact, I ran to my car without hesitation. I didn‚Äôt even take a moment to process what happened; I just drove home in a nearly catatonic state. Once I got home, I called Angela and told her I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and needed to take the day off. Lucky for me, it was Friday, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to address the situation until Monday. I‚Äôd have some time to think about what was going on and what I should do.

That Sunday was uneventful. I did some chores, watched a couple of movies, and spent time with my dogs. It was about 6 p.m. when I received a phone call from the hygienist, Sadie. 

She was frantic, and her words were hard to understand through her hysterics. ‚ÄúAmelia‚Ä¶ Oh my god. Amelia‚Ä¶ can you hear me?‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, Sadie, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù ‚ÄúDoc‚ÄîIt‚Äôs Doctor‚Ä¶ Doctor Lance. He‚Äîhe‚Äôs dead, or missing‚Ä¶ or‚Äîor‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúSadie, calm down. What are you talking about? I can‚Äôt understand you. Where are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúCome to the office, please.‚Äù

And just like that, she hung up. My heart was racing, and my thoughts were reeling as I jumped in my car and drove to the office, similar to how I had rushed home after Friday‚Äôs incident.

When I arrived, the parking lot was empty except for Sadie's car and the old sedan that belonged to Angela. The office was dark, but I could see a faint light coming from inside. I took a deep breath and walked up to the door, my hands shaking. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the dread settling in my stomach told me it wasn't good.

Inside, I found Sadie pacing the waiting room, her face pale and her eyes wide with fear. Angela was seated behind the reception desk, staring blankly at a spot on the wall, her face wet with tears. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù I demanded, my voice breaking as the tension overwhelmed me.

Sadie looked at me with a mixture of fear and confusion. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even think I can-‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take a seat, Sadie. Let me get some water.‚Äù I was trying hard to suppress my growing fear. I made my way to the water cooler in the break room and filled two plastic cups with cold water. I trembled my way back to the waiting room where Sadie sat biting her nails on one of the waiting room chairs. I handed her one of the glasses of water.

She took a shaky sip and then a deep breath. ‚ÄúI was supposed to meet the Lances for Lunch. We were going to discuss expanding the hygiene program to three days a week. When I got there, I knocked but no one answered. 

After I tried a few times, I started walking back to my car when I noticed a little pool of blood coming from under the garage door.‚Äù Sadies voice began to quiver and crack. I could feel her fear tangibly. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think, I just pulled on the front door. It was unlocked so I ran to the garage from the inside and‚Ä¶ Oh god, Amelia‚Ä¶‚Äù She began to cry once more as she put her face in her hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Sadie, take your time,‚Äù I said as I placed a comforting hand on her shoulder. I was never good at comforting a crying person, but I tried my best.

She wiped her tears and took another sip of water. ‚ÄúThere were little blood spatters a-and pools littered all over the garage. At least four pairs of bloody pliers I counted on the floor, but I-I didn‚Äôt see anyone. There was a rope hanging from the rafters‚Ä¶ a noose. But there was no one in it. The chair was even knocked over under it like someone had really done it. There was blood on the rope and everything. It was terrible‚Ä¶ so terrible. Amelia something bad happened.‚Äù She continued sobbing as I sat in disbelief. ‚ÄúSadie, did you call the police?‚Äù I asked quickly.

‚ÄúOf course child, I was with them all afternoon. They asked me so many questions, I couldn‚Äôt think straight when I left there. Their home looks like a god damn haunted house with all the crime scene tape. I never thought I‚Äôd see something like this Amelia.‚Äù As she continued her endless sobbing, I comforted her with a hug. Normally I‚Äôd sit uncomfortably while the grieving person did their thing, but in this moment, I needed that hug just as much as she did. I cried with her in all of my confusion, fear, and stress. I hoped the following days would bring answers. I hoped this was a terrible misunderstanding, but I should have known better.

I didn‚Äôt get much sleep that night. I sat up, my mind racing with endless questions. What could it all mean? Where was his body? Could he still be alive? Was this some terrible joke? And where was Angela? If it was murder, why the noose? The thoughts swirled in my head, loud and unrelenting. Little did I know, some of these questions would soon be answered.

The next morning, I woke up feeling like I had been run over. No one had contacted me about work, but I decided to go in, just in case someone was expecting me. When I arrived, I tried the front door, but it was locked. I headed to the back and used my key to get in. I set my bag on the breakroom table and quietly walked around the office, going room by room. I didn‚Äôt hear or see anyone, but something felt wrong. 

The air was thick and heavy, and the entire place seemed different. I told myself it was probably just the aftermath of last night's events.

When I reached Dr. Lance's office, I slowly opened the door. I half-expected to see him sitting there with a smile, asking about my weekend. If I hadn‚Äôt been so frightened of him after Friday, I might have even wished to confide in him about his own disappearance. 

But the office was as empty as I had expected.
As I scanned the room, something caught my eye on the corner of his desk. I stepped closer for a better look, and my brain struggled to make sense of the grisly sight in front of me. It was a canine tooth crossed under a lateral, with a molar perched on top. The roots of the molar wrapped around the single-rooted teeth, acting as a sort of clamp. They were still bloody, the blood looking dried, but not completely‚Äîstill holding onto its red hue. I stared at it, unsure of what to do.

I decided to run to the nearest operatory to put on gloves. Grabbing a sterile pouch from the lab, I carefully placed the strange tooth formation inside. I examined it for a few moments before sliding it into my pocket. I searched the room for any other signs of something unusual, but nothing else seemed out of place. The only thing missing was the small vial of teeth Dr. Lance had been staring at before he lashed out at me. I wondered if it meant anything, but decided to bring the evidence to the police and give them any information they might need.

As I turned to leave the room, I nearly collided with Angela, who was standing silently behind me. I screamed, jumping out of my skin. Once I realized who it was, I bent over, trying to catch my breath. ‚ÄúJesus, Angela, you scared me half to death. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be coming to work today.‚Äù I waited for a response, but she stared blankly at the corner of the desk. ‚ÄúAngela? Are you alright?‚Äù I asked, growing concerned.

‚ÄúWhat were you doing in here?‚Äù she asked, her voice flat and devoid of emotion. My face grew pale. Not this again, I thought. This strange energy was getting out of hand, and I felt like a frightened animal backed into a corner. ‚ÄúN-nothing, I just‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have no reason to be in here. Get out,‚Äù she said, her voice lifeless. I completely understood, considering what had just happened to her husband. I nodded and slipped out of the room without protest. As I rushed back to the break room, a shiver ran down my spine. All of this odd behavior was getting to me, so I grabbed my bag and hurried out the back door.

As I pulled out of the parking lot, I decided I didn‚Äôt want to go home just yet. There was so much going through my mind, and I needed to clear my head with a nice long drive. I drove around the familiar streets and backroads of the town for about forty-five minutes, lost in thought. Eventually, I decided to drive past the Lance's home, just to see if what Sadie had described was exaggerated or not.

I had only visited their white picket-fenced home once before. They had invited me over one Friday to play some board games with their twin niece and nephew. They were about my age, and we actually had a wonderful time. Being fairly anti-social, it was a pleasant surprise to get along so well with a four-person group. The whole family seemed picture-perfect, with their welcoming smiles and a home that smelled like warm coffee and vanilla. As I reminisced, I turned the corner onto their street, and my eyes were immediately drawn to the end of it.

Their beautiful home, once a place of love and excitement, was now a sight that would make anyone feel sick. It made me wonder once more how things had gone so wrong so quickly. 

The crime scene tape covered the closed garage door, the front door, and acted as a fence around the whole yard. It was completely void of life, and the beautiful flowers that once lined the walkway were shriveled and dried. I slowly drove to the end of the street and parked my car in front of the neighbor's house for a moment. My nose began to sting as tears welled up again. A single tear rolled down my cheek, but before I could really cry, I noticed one of the blinds in the upstairs windows being pulled down as if someone was trying to peek out without being seen. My emotions quickly shifted to laser focus. I couldn‚Äôt make out any person, and for a moment, I thought maybe the blinds were just broken and always looked like that.

As soon as the thought crossed my mind, I received a text. I glanced down at my phone and saw ‚ÄúText message‚ÄîAngela.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt open it right away but looked back up at the window. The blinds were back in their original shape, as if nothing had ever been out of place. My heart stopped, and I sucked in a barely audible gasp before quickly shifting my car back into drive. I didn‚Äôt want to stick around to see who or what was watching me. I whipped out of that neighborhood like a bat out of hell and decided it was time to go home.

As soon as I got home, I sank into the couch and turned on the TV. Angela's text was still waiting on my phone. I let Face ID unlock it so I could see the preview. It read, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be messing with things that you don‚Äî‚Äù The pit in my stomach deepened. I hadn‚Äôt even read the whole text, but I felt like I was being threatened by the Italian mafia or something. ‚ÄúFuck, dude,‚Äù I said out loud to myself. I was so tired of all this mess. At this point, I felt like begging my previous boss for my job back. I‚Äôd gladly take some Gossip Girl drama over whatever this was. I braced myself before opening the full message from Angela.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be messing with things that you don‚Äôt understand, Amelia. I need you to return what you stole by tomorrow morning. If it isn‚Äôt returned, bad things will happen. I‚Äôm serious.‚Äù Now, I felt that my life was in danger. I contemplated my next actions carefully. Should I respond to her text or just leave it alone and call the police? I was scared. No, I was terrified. I wanted out of this situation and didn‚Äôt want to deal with whatever messy consequences would inevitably come from all of this. But I knew I didn‚Äôt have a choice. I decided to do both.

I quickly typed back, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really scaring me, Angela,‚Äù and hit send. I decided I would visit the police department first thing tomorrow morning. I‚Äôd bring them the odd tooth formation I found and show them the creepy text I received from Angela. I was beginning to think Angela played a big part in whatever happened to Dr. Lance. I got up and made sure all of my doors and windows were locked, just in case I really was in danger. I didn‚Äôt fully believe Angela‚Äôs threat, but I didn‚Äôt want to take any chances either.

As I made my way to the kitchen to make myself a light lunch, my phone chimed again. ‚ÄúText message‚ÄîAngela.‚Äù This time, I immediately opened it. ‚ÄúThis is much bigger than both of us. I‚Äôm warning you because I care about you. Do as I say, Amelia, or you will regret it.‚Äù I nearly dropped my phone. What the hell was she talking about? I decided it was time to turn my phone on Do Not Disturb.

This was all too messy and too much for my brain to wrap around. I made myself a PB&J and turned on YouTube. I watched Moist Critical police chase videos and crocheted until the sun went down. It worked. I managed to wash my brain of the issue that had been haunting me, even if it was only temporary.

Around nine-thirty, I took my dogs out and herded them into their kennels. Most nights, I let them sleep in my bed, but tonight I wanted them to stay in the living room so that if anyone tried to break in, they would alert me. I brought my katana, which normally hung on the wall for decoration, into the bedroom with me. I set it on the floor next to my bed and wrapped myself up in the comforter. Surprisingly, it didn‚Äôt take long for me to fall asleep, despite my current dilemma. The constant stress must have been wearing on me.

It was three-thirty on the dot when my eyes shot open. I didn‚Äôt hear or feel anything out of the ordinary, so I wasn‚Äôt sure what had woken me. My eyes drifted to the alarm clock, and I lay still and silent, just to make sure it wasn‚Äôt an intruder. But my dogs were quiet, which meant I was safe. I let out a deep, sleepy breath and rolled onto my side, ready to drift back to sleep. That‚Äôs when I heard it‚Äîa plastic-sounding scrape coming from under the bed.

I froze, straining to listen. The floors were real wood, so I thought maybe one of the dog balls was rolling around with a draft, something that happened from time to time. But what I heard next was unmistakably horrifying: an impossibly deep, nearly demonic-sounding breath, like the sound CGI dinosaurs make in movies when they‚Äôre quietly hunting their prey. My skin turned to ice, and my whole body went rigid.

‚ÄúAmelia, is it?‚Äù a deep, whispering voice came from directly beneath me. I couldn‚Äôt move, let alone respond. I heard it shift slightly, but it didn‚Äôt sound like a person with rustling clothes‚Äîit was more like plastic beads rolling on the floor. Something crawled up the wall and gently placed itself over my forehead. It felt like a snake-like tentacle, covered in hard bumps. I whimpered, paralyzed with fear. I couldn‚Äôt see anything in the pitch-black room, and the thought of dying at the hands of an unknown creature in my own bed was too much to process. Its voice came again, like the sound of a spinning quarter on a wooden desk. ‚ÄúA woman of great taste‚Ä¶‚Äù It trailed off as another beady tentacle slithered under my chin.

Tears silently rolled down my face, wetting my hair beneath me. I sniffled and grimaced at the disgusting creature holding onto me. ‚ÄúA profession of little desire‚Ä¶ but why?‚Äù it asked in a menacing tone. The tentacle under my chin slithered its way between my lips, forcing my mouth open. I tried to keep my jaw shut, but the creature‚Äôs strength was unimaginable. I thought my jaw might break if I resisted any longer.

The tip of the tentacle probed around inside my mouth, starting on the top right and moving to the back, feeling each and every one of my teeth one by one, right to left, left to right. I trembled uncontrollably, hoping against all hope that this was the most vivid nightmare I had ever had.

When it reached the lower right side of my mouth, the tip of the tentacle perched itself on top of my last molar. With one quick tap, I felt the tooth crack, and I screamed in agony. During my four years as a dental assistant, I had learned that each tooth has somewhere around seventy nerve endings, and I felt each and every one of them screaming for help. The tentacle flicked upward, running itself from my soft palate, causing me to gag, to the back of my front teeth.

I continued to cry in pain as it caressed my face with the now slobbery tentacle. ‚ÄúReturn what is not yours, and you‚Äôll never have to see me again‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to turn any more of those pearly whites into a problem.‚Äù As it spoke its last words, it slowly released me.

I heard the beady creature recoil under the bed as the right side of my face throbbed. I needed medical attention or painkillers, but both were far out of reach for the same reason‚ÄîI couldn‚Äôt force myself to leave the bed. So I lay there, frozen, staring at the ceiling in silence until the sun came up. At some point, I managed to curl myself into the fetal position, quivering uncontrollably.

I probably would have stayed there forever in shock if my dogs hadn‚Äôt started whining and scratching at their kennels. This was their normal morning behavior, their reminder to Mom to get them breakfast.

Slowly, I unfolded myself and sat up, scanning the room for any Cthulhu-like creatures, but of course, everything was in its place. I carefully scooted to the edge of the bed, where the door handle was waiting for me. I reached for the handle, opened the door without taking a step off the bed, took a shaky breath, jumped off the bed, and ran to the living room as if something were on my heels. I looked around and finally accepted that I was safe. I opened the two kennels and gladly welcomed the excited kisses from my dogs, their fuzzy bottoms giving me a small rush of serotonin.

Once they were taken care of, I grabbed the stupid tooth formation from the counter and made my way to the office once again. I didn‚Äôt even change out of my sweatpants or my stained PJ shirt. I looked exactly how I felt.

I pulled into the office parking lot to find it was empty once more. I unlocked the back door, flung it open, and hustled to Dr. Lance's office. I placed the sterile pouch containing the creepy teeth on the desk and quickly made my way back to the exit. I didn‚Äôt look around for anything odd or try to gather any more clues‚ÄîI was done. I never wanted any reason to piss that thing off again. I didn‚Äôt care if Dr. Lance‚Äôs body was super glued to the wall‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt see anything.

I quickly drove to the prompt care clinic a few blocks away and waited for a couple of agonizing hours before I was finally seen. When they brought me back, I explained that I had broken a tooth by biting down on an almond. 

The lie was stupid, but I couldn‚Äôt think of anything else. They took an X-ray, and when the doctor came in, he looked peppy, but I wasn‚Äôt feeling it. ‚ÄúLooks like you had a rough night!‚Äù he said with a small chuckle and a big white smile. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I grumbled, trying not to act like a total jerk. ‚ÄúI was looking over your chart and X-rays. You bit down on an almond?‚Äù he asked, as if it were unbelievable. I nodded, wondering why he was questioning my story. I thought it was the most believable I could come up with. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that the tooth cracked in a very unique way. I‚Äôve never seen a crack quite like this. I‚Äôm no dentist, but we do get our fair share of tooth infections and fractures on the weekends.‚Äù

I quickly followed up, ‚ÄúMay I see? I work in dental.‚Äù I was nervous, wondering how badly this thing had messed up my mouth. ‚ÄúSure thing,‚Äù he said, pulling up the X-ray software on the monitor in front of us. When he opened the periapical, I was floored.

As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôve been reading X-rays for about four years. I‚Äôve seen many things that defy what I believed to be standard: a front tooth that broke in half horizontally, a tooth stuck sideways in someone's chin, a grown woman with seven baby teeth‚Äîyou name it, and it‚Äôs most likely happened. But when I saw the state of my molar, which had been perfectly healthy just yesterday, it absolutely defied my expectations.

The tooth had a large abscess at both root tips, at least three large cavities, and the crown had been split into four pieces, divided by the roots. The cracks visible in the X-ray were so large that we didn‚Äôt need a specialist to locate them. 

‚ÄúJesus Christ,‚Äù I finally managed to say. ‚ÄúMy thoughts exactly! But it looks like this tooth has been a silent problem for many years. Let‚Äôs get you some antibiotics for that abscess, and then you should see your dentist as soon as possible.‚Äù ‚ÄúOkay, thanks,‚Äù I muttered, unable to take my eyes off the screen. I didn‚Äôt blame him for thinking this had been an ongoing problem. If I had seen this in someone else, I would have said the same thing.

I made an appointment at one of the corporate dental offices in my area to get the tooth extracted. They were able to get me in the same day, so after the appointment, I came home with a numb face and one less tooth in my jaw. I asked the doctor to let me keep my tooth so I could examine it when I got home. I held it up in the ziplock bag and gazed in amazement, thinking about how something so small could cause so much pain. I decided it was time to start looking for a new job, and I hoped I‚Äôd never hear from Angela again.

Should I give him another chance?,"I was with my ex for 5.5 years. We lived together for 8 months. He broke up with me and I moved out the same day. I was shocked at the time and very upset, but I left without putting up a fight.

I should say we definitely did have issues, so while I was blindsided, the issues were already present, and we hadn't been working to resolve them. 

I moved on and started dating others. My ex and I actually matched on Hinge at one point.

Anyway, he came around today under the guise of ""returning something"". He asked me to coffee and I agreed. He ended up professing he's been on 30 first dates, none have compared to me, he regrets the breakup deeply, he read a life changing book and he's worked on himself and he's changed, and he sees the changes I've made as well, and he thinks if he knew what he knows now, he could have saved the relationship or not given up so easily.

I do believe he's made changes, but I just don't know whether they are going to be long-term ones as it's only been a few months..

I'm trying to decide if it would be worth it to see him again. I currently have 0 feelings for him. I tried kissing him and I felt absolutely nothing. Should I give it another chance and go on a few dates with him to see if the feelings come back?

I might also add that I currently have a non-exclusive FWB. My fwb is amazing in terms of both emotional support and sexual/intimacy. I am comparing my ex to him and my ex just doesn't even come close in the depth of sexuality and emotionality this other guy has offered me in just a few short dates...my fwb just kisses me so much more passionately, gives me the foreplay I want, has deep talks with me. I'm not sure my ex would even be capable of this stuff...

1nn380i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1nn380i/marquis_los_cabos_vs_le_blanc_cancun/,Marquis Los Cabos vs. Le Blanc Cancun,"Hello all,

My wife and I are planning a trip to our first all inclusive in late May 2026 and we've narrowed it down to the above two options: Marquis Los Cabos or Le Blanc Cancun. We'd love to do Le Blanc Cabo or Grand Velas, but they're out of our price range. We're looking for a luxurious, relaxed stay as a couple. We'll probably spend most of our time at the pool or sitting on the beach. I doubt we'll do any excursions, and we're not interested in nightlife (in fact, we'd prefer a place without robust nightlife). I'd love to have good food and swim in the ocean some, but between the water in Cabo and the sargassum in Cancun, I'm not expecting much ocean time at either place. My wife, on the other hand, loves a spa, which I'm not really interested in. She also wants to feel safe--I think both of these areas are going to be very safe, but I'll throw that out there as well.

We're looking to keep the resort costs at or below $5000. We can go to Le Blanc Cancun for about 4400 for a lagoon view room, or 4700 for an ocean view. Plus we can get about 850 in resort credit. Meanwhile, we can go to Marquis for about 3900 for an oceanview (or 3200 for a garden view, but we'd go with the ocean view). And it looks like we could get about 50 in resort credit (so basically nothing). Flight to Cabo is a hair more expensive and about 1.5 hours longer, but that wouldn't keep us from going to Cabo if it was the better option.

It appears that the pros of Le Blanc are that it will be more luxurious: food will be better, drinks will likely be better, and there'll be more options (more bars, restaurants, coffee shops, etc.). Also the beach is swimmable. Cons are that they're going to try and sell us on the timeshare (but we can just say no to the presentation), the sargassum will likely be very bad that time of year, and it's several hundred dollars more expensive. Also I felt a little underwhelmed by the rooms I've seen online, but I could be mistaken.

Pros of Marquis seem to be that the area around it, and the property itself, is beautiful. The rooms look bigger than Le Blanc (I could be wrong there, but they certainly don't seem any smaller) and very nice, the beach looks gorgeous, there's no sargassum, and it's not a timeshare resort. The cons seem to be that the beach isn't swimmable (though there's a swimmable beach about a 15-minute walk down the beach from Marquis), it seems like there aren't as many options for food (and the options that are there aren't going to be quite as good as Le Blanc), and I've seen several reviews that the drinks are watered-down at Marquis as well. It also looks like the minibar is comparatively worse--specifically, there's no in-room liquor--but that's also not going to be a dealbreaker in and of itself.

Do y'all have any recommendations as we consider these two properties, especially if you've been to both of these properties? I've done a lot of digging and landed on LBC over Atelier, Beloved Playa Mujeres, etc, in Cancun, and Marquis over Secrets, Riu, etc. in Cabo But let me know if you feel strongly that there are better properties that I'm leaving out.

Thank you all for your advice!",1,1758487679.0,AllInclusiveResorts,2,1.0,False

Anyway, I am in my 30s, living with elderly relatives, re-training in college, will probably  never be able to afford a down payment on a  mortgage for at least another 10 years, in fact I doubt I would even be able to afford to rent or find a place at this stage.

 In other words, I don't really have much to offer, after the initial period of going for a  coffee, a drink, a gig, a short trip, I can't really offer anything stable/long term. 

I would love to have a good and proper relationship and settle down, but Hypothetically,  Even if things were to get to a more serious stage of moving into together and ""settling down"" I don't think I would be able to (even if by some miracle ""we"" could get a place) I would have to live nearby (which is not very feasible for the area) due to elderly relatives health etc.. and even for the short term, the likes of sex and intimate relations has to be done through the likes of hotel rooms or something.

As mentioned I would love, to be in a proper relationship and settle down and have a family, but I guess the realisation is kind of kicking in that I most likely will never have  kids or even a place of my own till i nearly hit retirement age.

So in that respect, that is kind of my issue with dating, I seem kind of doomed to only short term relationships. 

Surely something has to give at some stage, right?? There is literally two generations locked out from both housing and creating families, I surely can't be the only person experiencing this??? I don't know if it was this sub, but there was someone yesterday with a post,who is about to get married and saving for a place, and they have never lived with their partner! Is that the new normal now?? 

Getting dates is fine, but is it worth continuing dating, only to have a new partner every few months up until feelings start to get involved, because you can't offer anything long-term??

# .. on Mycopunk Architecture and the Future of European Urban Space

The caf√© sat tucked into a corner of Vienna's Floridsdorf district, its windows offering a view across the Danube toward the city center's imperial silhouette. Dr. Ingrid Hausmann, urban theorist at the Vienna University of Technology, traced patterns on the condensation while waiting. Across from her, architect Tom√°≈° Moravec sketched impossible structures on napkins - vertical gardens climbing between buildings, scaffolded networks spanning entire city blocks.

""You're drawing it again,"" Ingrid observed, noting the delicate lines that suggested something between construction site and botanical garden.

""I can't stop seeing it,"" Tom√°≈° replied, not looking up from his sketch. ""Every time I walk through Floridsdorf, I see the gaps. The vertical spaces we're not using. The social possibilities we're ignoring. Vienna has this incredible urban fabric - these beautiful Wiener blocks - but we're only inhabiting half of them.""

""Explain what you mean by 'half.'""

Tom√°≈° pushed his coffee aside and spread three napkins across the table. On the first, he drew the familiar pattern of Vienna's Blockrandbebauung - buildings arranged around the perimeter of city blocks, creating internal courtyards.

""This,"" he said, tapping the drawing, ""is how we've organized space for many centuries. Buildings facing outward toward the street, interior spaces kept private, each resident identifying with their street address rather than their block community.""

Ingrid studied the sketch. As an urban theorist, she'd analyzed countless examples of Viennese block development, but Tom√°≈°'s framing highlighted something she'd overlooked. ""You're suggesting people don't recognize the spatial relationships they are living in?""

""Exactly. A resident of Adalbert-Stifter-Stra√üe doesn't think of themselves as sharing space with someone on Pastorstra√üe, even though they live in the same building complex, sharing walls, infrastructure, even courtyards. The street naming system fragments what should be understood as unified spatial entities. They cannot see the block or the larger housing cluster for the individual house .. and the street that gives its name to the house. It is a linguistic filter, a barrier for our perception. Because of the streets that boarder the property we have multible names and numbers for the indivdual houses that make up the phenomenon of the Wiener block. This block or urban cluster is a ‚Äúwhole‚Äù, a unit that is formed by real spatial and concrete realities but we do not have a name for them and things that have no names cannot be seen. The naming system diverts or perception from the nature of our real urban environemts .""

""So residents relate to linear traffic corridors rather than the three-dimensional spaces they actually inhabit.""

""Precisely. And this cognitive mapping shapes everything - local identity formation, community formation, resource sharing, collective decision-making. We're organized around lines instead of volumes, flows instead of places. This makes it hard to see the common ground wich is actually the spaces and places inbetween these lines and grids we call traffic system. Our naming practices orient ourselves unconciously toward the street, outward but if we flip that notion and name the actual places, the places and larger structures we actually inhabit, orienting ourselves inward, we can develop a new sense for the city, our neighbours, our shared facilities and a perspective that shows a completely new urban granularity .. because once you see the block, you can see the pattern and with that the real fabric of our urban reality""

Tom√°≈° began sketching on the second napkin, showing the same block pattern but wrapped in delicate organic structures. ""But what if we made the spatial relationships visible? What if we gave each block a distinct identity that residents could see and touch and move through?""

**Ingrid:**¬†Let's start with the conceptual framework. You're proposing what you call 'mycopunk architecture' - can you explain how fungal principles apply to urban design?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Mycelium grows by extending networks across available surfaces, optimizing for nutrient flow and information exchange. It doesn't impose rigid hierarchies - it adapts to existing conditions while creating new possibilities for connection. When I look at Vienna's urban fabric, I see a similar opportunity. Our buildings are like isolated cells. Like when you are looking through a microscope, the whole tissue is the city but when you zoom in, you see that it is made of these singular polygonal entities - You see the urban blocks like urban cells. What we are invoking here is a new form of connective tissue, a threedimensional support structure not unlike fascia in a human body - a growing and adapting matrix made of modular elements that could be networked and shrunk or expanded as needed.

**Ingrid:**¬†But cities aren't ecosystems in any literal sense. They're human constructions governed by property law, building codes, economic relationships...

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Of course. But the principles of network growth, surface optimization, and adaptive expansion - these apply to social systems as much as biological ones. When we increase the surface area of urban space through scaffolding, we create new possibilities for economic activity, community interaction, ecological services. We're not mimicking biology - we're applying biological logic to social and structural problems.

**Ingrid:**¬†Give me a concrete example of how this works in practice.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Take a typical block in Floridsdorf. Currently, residents exit their buildings onto sidewalks, move through traffic corridors, interact primarily through commercial spaces. But imagine if every building in that block instantiates scaffolded extensions - lightweight structures providing shade, water catchment, growing space, community areas. We could immidiately reap the structural benefits - and the first and major one is insulation, most buildings in Floridsdorf are from the 50s and 60s and so are poorly insulated to this day, these residents would feel the benefit in the next winter and summer since the structures are build to shade the buildingmass and can reduce the surrounding temperature by up to 17¬∞C. That is a hughe benefit for residents, their wellbeeing and natural systems alike. And that is just the insulation aspect, we have a massive undertaking from the government to upgrade those individual houses. You know what happens, the construction workers come in, errect a temporary scaffolding and glue polystyrene boards to the walls, deconstruct the scaffold and leave. And yeah, it works but does not improve the quality of life as drastic as mycopunk architecture could. You see the irony, both paths use the same tool. ""Scaffolding structure‚Äù one party uses it temporary and will leave the house, well thicker and objectively unhealthy, mantled in a sheet of VOC emitting foamboards that last up to 50 years, with no real plan for handling afterwards, other than discarding and reaplying the same procedure. Well mycopunk understands the basic need of natural systems for scaffolding and support structures. A fungus is basicaly a living and evolving/adapting scaffolding made of many tiny filaments that grows between systems and acts as intermediary for higher lifeforms. It takes up the task to mediate between the plant kingdom and the soilbacteria exchanging nutrients and water - it is the interface between the geosphere and higher lifeforms. That is exactly what we are doing here just on a much larger scale. Mediating between geosphere/buildt environment/city and human/plant/animal life - so the scaffold has to be permanent to do its duty. This tool will bring the human in contact with the building exterior, that makes all interactions regarding maintainance work much easier, in all furture interactions and scenarios. The first scenario will be the mentioned ""Upgrade by insulation"" and we are currently developing a novel industrial system that is able to produce insulation materials, just like the foamboards but made of mycelium and agricultural waste. The prototyping stage is over and the next step will be large scale implementation and the duration of these materials will extend far beyond the 50 years mark as with petrochemicals if maintained properly. Even better, because of the permanent access to higher elevations without lift or ladder, we can ensure regular inspection and possible adaptation ie the application of additional layers if needed. The next step in this operation, after insulating the raw building, we apply a layer of moss. Just like in a real life forest, we build up our new habitat from the bottom up. Moss, the perfect companion, will grow everywhere it can take hold on and with basic intrgrated hydroponic techniques we can manage the surfacequality of our cities. Not only will all those tiny green filaments dampen the soundscape drasticaly, but they will, through evapotranspiration actively cool the buildingmass and mange humidity in the surrounding habitat. We can even shape these prefabricated mosspanels so that they resemble the decorum of traditional Gr√ºnderzeit buildings and bring the style and spirit of Vienna to districts that as of now are dominated by architectural slob and buildings that are nowhere near ready for the future.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're describing a fundamental alteration of public-private boundaries.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†I'm describing an evolution of those boundaries. The space above sidewalks, the vertical zones along building facades - these are currently empty, unused and even harmful, think of all that radiation that such a facade and roof collects all day long during summer or windy corridors that funnel unhindered winds through the city. We could activate them without interfering with existing traffic flows or building functions. Residents would still have their private apartments, their work, their friends, everything would work as before but they'd also have access to semi-private scaffolded spaces on the roof and genuinely communal areas where buildings connect.

**Ingrid:**¬†And you think this changes social relationships?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†It makes existing relationships visible and provides infrastructure for new ones. When you can see that your building connects to five others through scaffolded networks, when you share water catchment and food production systems, when your children play in elevated gardens that span multiple properties - the old fiction of individual ownership starts to feel inadequate. It is a visceral thing, you see the connections and feel the quality of well maintained shared spaces.

**Ingrid:**¬†Let's talk about identity formation. Vienna has a strong tradition of neighborhood identification - people are proud to be from Ottakring or Leopoldstadt or wherever. How does your scaffolded approach relate to existing cultural patterns?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†It works with them, but at a different scale. Currently, district identity is somewhat abstract -you can't easily see where Floridsdorf ends and Donaustadt begins. Street identity is too granular - defining yourself by your address creates artificial separations. But a scaffolded block becomes a visible, tangible entity. You can see its boundaries, understand its internal relationships, you know the people there and can participate in its collective decision-making. And somehow we create more critical mass, its a numbers game since these collective entities are larger, peoplewise, than normal housing units there just is more chance to be mutual connected to a few of them by sympathy, interrrest or profession. I think that is the real potential that we are tapping in. You just do not know what people live in your area, in your block but, statisticaly, among 300 people, there is someone you have important things to tell. That is something that social media proposed but channeled into the virtual global spheres of the internet. In a way this mycopunk thing will be the implementation of this hyperconnected aproach but in the realworld. You can think of these structures as smartphones, platforms to install apps without reconfiguring the whole system. Insulation is an app, mosswalls are an app, hydroponic systems and rooftopgarden are apps, solarpower-app, windpower-app and everything is optional, configurable and reconfigurable by the people. For sure there will be social apps aswell.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're creating what - administrative units that correspond to spatial realities?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†I'm creating spatial realities that could support new forms of administration. When a block functions as an integrated system - sharing energy production, water management, food growing, waste processing - it needs governance structures that match its operational scale. You can't manage a network through individual property owners making isolated decisions.

**Ingrid:**¬†This sounds like you're proposing new forms of collective ownership.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†New forms of collective stewardship. The scaffolding doesn't eliminate private property - it creates shared infrastructure that requires collaborative management. Like how apartment buildings have homeowner associations, but extended to include ecological systems and community spaces.

**Ingrid:**¬†And you think people will accept increased responsibility for shared systems?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†People already accept enormous responsibility for shared systems - they pay taxes for roads and schools and hospitals they might never use. This is just more local, more immediate, more directly connected to daily life. When the scaffolded gardens provide food for community kitchens, when the water catchment systems prevent flooding, when the shading structures reduce energy costs - the benefits are obvious and personal.

**Ingrid:**¬†Let's examine the economic implications. You're essentially proposing that Vienna invest in retrofitting every building in the city with extensive external infrastructure. The capital costs must be enormous.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Less enormous than you might think, and the returns are multiple. First, these are lightweight structures - myco material scaffolding, modular components, systems designed for easy assembly and modification. Second, they provide immediate economic benefits through energy savings, food production, water management. Third, they create new industries and employment opportunities.

**Ingrid:**¬†Explain the employment angle.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†When you increase urban surface area by orders of magnitude, you need people to tend all that new productive space. Vertical gardeners, water system technicians, modular construction specialists, community coordinators. These aren't jobs that can be automated or outsourced - they require local knowledge and hands-on engagement with physical systems.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're describing a shift from service economy to care economy.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Exactly. Instead of people commuting to office buildings to process abstract information, they're caring for the living systems that support their communities. The work is meaningful, the benefits are tangible, and the skills transfer across multiple domains - and as said, things inside these homes are as before, people will work at their jobs like they do now but we offer additional positions for this care and maintainance work. This opens up the opportunity for small companies or residents to engage and manage these living systems.

**Ingrid:**¬†But how do you finance the initial investment?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Multiple funding streams. Municipal investment in climate adaptation infrastructure. EU funding for urban sustainability initiatives. Private investment attracted by the tourism potential - Vienna as the world's first scaffolded city. Community investment through reduced utility costs and increased property values. And phased implementation - you don't scaffold the city overnight. One thing that we should not forget is that viennas most renowed structures were enabled by such massive undertakings. The Ringstra√üe for example was a massive project and it did cost a fortune but we still reap the benefits of that ""revitalisation"" or the construction of the Donauinsel among numerous others. Cities evolve and often the initial investment pays back plenty in the long run. Especialy infrastructure projects and arguably the companies that build roads, buildings and infrastructure are the economic backbone of Austria, employing and creating - that is why our economic health as a nation needs constant growth. Those companies need massive projects to expand onto - unfortunately they are geared towards concret and steel. We now offer another route, we are builders, our economies need constant expansion or rebuilding, we have that know how and hightech facilities to build - so why not building something needed and useful. This could be a whole new sector of our economy and the benefit of infrastructure investments is the hands on involvement of the people that do construct these structures. In their hands and pockets the money will end. The costs, the costs, yes but if you see this as a state, think like a benevolent state, you have to see the people to whome the costs will run off or trickle down to as real money in their pockets - to craftsman, coordinators, trader, planner etc. This is realworld downward wealth distribution and if done correctly is a money hack as long as we keep corruption and bribery in check.

**Ingrid:**¬†You mentioned tourism. Elaborate on that.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Vienna already attracts millions of visitors annually, primarily for historical architecture and cultural institutions. But imagine being the first city to demonstrate post-carbon urban living at scale. People would come to see functioning vertical ecosystems, to experience three-dimensional community spaces, to understand how cities can be productive rather than just consumptive.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're proposing a new type of urban tourism -experiential rather than heritage-focused.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†And educational. Urban planners, architects, policymakers, community organizers - they'd come to study replicable approaches to climate adaptation. Vienna becomes an export center for urban technologies and governance innovations.

**Ingrid:**¬†This assumes the experiment succeeds. What if scaffolded blocks create more problems than they solve?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†That's why you start small and modular. Pilot projects in willing neighborhoods, careful monitoring of outcomes, adaptive modifications based on what you learn. The beauty of scaffolding is that it's not permanent infrastructure - if something doesn't work, you can adjust or remove it without massive demolition.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're treating urban development as experimental practice.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Cities have always been experiments. The difference is acknowledging the experimental nature and designing for learning rather than pretending we know the optimal solutions in advance. Scaffolded systems are designed for continuous modification based on changing needs and improved understanding.

**Ingrid:**¬†Let's talk about resistance. Not everyone wants their building wrapped in scaffolding, their street shaded by community gardens, their property values dependent on collective infrastructure management.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Of course. And that resistance is valuable information about design requirements. Maybe full scaffolding isn't appropriate for every building or every neighborhood. Maybe some areas need minimal intervention while others embrace radical transformation. The approach is flexible enough to accommodate different comfort levels with change.

**Ingrid:**¬†But you can't have a networked system with gaps. If some buildings participate and others don't, the connectivity benefits disappear.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Not necessarily. Networks can function with varying participation levels. Some buildings might contribute only basic scaffolding for shading and insulation. Others might host community gardens or energy generation systems. Still others might serve as network nodes connecting multiple blocks. Different levels of engagement, but still contributing to system function.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're describing opt-in urbanism rather than comprehensive planning.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†I'm describing responsive urbanism. Planning that adapts to community preferences while providing infrastructure for increased cooperation when communities choose it. Force creates resistance. Invitation creates possibilities.

**Ingrid:**¬†I want to push back on the aesthetics question. Vienna has protected architectural heritage, UNESCO World Heritage status for the historic center. Your scaffolded structures would dramatically alter the visual character of the city.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†They would alter it, yes. But consider what we're protecting and why. The historic center represents aristocratic and bourgeois aesthetics from imperial periods - beautiful, certainly, but also expressions of social hierarchies and resource extraction patterns that are no longer sustainable. These buildings need to be preserved because they give us insight on why we are where we are today. Yes they are beautiful but it often came with a bloody cost. We have to see both sides of that coin and be able to reflect on that relationship between power, people and aesthetics, herefore the historic buildings must be conserved and be treated like the important artefacts that they are. Our approach is not for those buildings and we should not interfere with them. This is old Austria, the historic Vienna, seat of Kings and Queens long gone. We are here for the future of Austria, the path into the 22nd century and for that we have the responsability of keeping balance between the old and the radical new. As a city of the high arts and elaborated cultural practices we have the unique opportunity to atone for our sins - our sins in terms of building cheap and somewhat ugly. All those post-war era buildings that are still used and are to pricey to dismantle and rebuild - that is our niche. Abandoned lots in the outer districts, parking spaces in the periphery - our niche. Not the Monuments and historic structures need revitalisation, somehow they are dead already and frozen in time, but the places of real people in poorer and underdeveloped neighbourhoods need our attention.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're suggesting aesthetic values should be subordinated to ecological functionality?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†I'm suggesting aesthetic values can evolve to incorporate ecological functionality. When you see a building wrapped in productive scaffolding - green walls filtering air, water systems managing rainfall, elevated gardens feeding communities - that can be as beautiful as baroque facades, just expressing different values.

**Ingrid:**¬†Beauty as expression of ecological health rather than economic power.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Exactly. And more democratic beauty - created through community participation rather than imposed by architects serving wealthy patrons. When residents design and tend their own scaffolded extensions, they create aesthetic expressions that reflect their actual lives and needs.

**Ingrid:**¬†But what about architectural coherence? If every building sprouts different scaffolding configurations, doesn't the urban landscape become chaotic?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Or it becomes alive. Forests aren't chaotic just because every tree is different. There are underlying patterns - responses to soil conditions, sunlight, water availability - that create coherent ecosystems despite surface variation. Scaffolded neighborhoods would have similar organic coherence based on shared infrastructure requirements and community decisions.

**Ingrid:**¬†Let's examine the political implications. You're describing governance structures that don't align with existing municipal administration. How do scaffolded blocks relate to district councils, city planning departments, federal housing policies?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†They create new interfaces between different levels of government. A scaffolded block might be too large for individual property management but too small for district administration. So you need new institutional forms - block assemblies, network coordinators, resource sharing agreements that cross traditional administrative boundaries.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're describing a more complex, more participatory form of urban governance.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†More distributed, certainly. Instead of hierarchical decision-making from city hall down to individual properties, you have networks of relationships between blocks, districts, regions, with decisions made at the scale where they have most impact.

**Ingrid:**¬†This sounds like what political theorists call 'subsidiarity' - handling issues at the most local level possible.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†But with recognition that local decisions often have network effects. If one block decides to change its water management system, that affects neighboring blocks. So you need governance structures that can coordinate across scales while respecting local autonomy.

**Ingrid:**¬†And you think Vienna's municipal government would support such institutional innovation?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Vienna has a strong tradition of social innovation - public housing, district heating, participatory budgeting. The city government understands that climate adaptation requires new approaches to urban organization. The question is whether they're willing to experiment with scaffolded solutions before crisis forces more dramatic changes.

**Ingrid:**¬†We've been talking for over an hour, and I keep thinking about children. How would growing up in scaffolded environments shape the next generation's relationship to urban space?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†That might be the most important question. Children who grow up moving through three-dimensional community networks, who understand buildings as living systems, who participate in collective resource management from an early age - they'll have completely different assumptions about what cities can be.

**Ingrid:**¬†A different cognitive mapping of space.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†Different understanding of agency. Current urban children learn that they're consumers of city services - passive recipients of housing, transportation, education provided by distant institutions. Scaffolded children would grow up as participants in urban metabolism - helping tend the systems that sustain community life.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're describing a more ecological form of civic education.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†And more embodied. Instead of learning about citizenship through textbooks and voting exercises, they'd learn through daily participation in systems that require cooperation to function. They'd understand viscerally that individual wellbeing depends on collective health.

**Ingrid:**¬†But would they still be prepared for participation in larger political systems -national governments, international relations, global economic networks?

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†More prepared, I think. Someone who understands how to coordinate resource flows across multiple building networks, who can facilitate decision-making in diverse community groups, who thinks systemically about interconnected challenges - those skills scale up to regional and global challenges.

**Ingrid:**¬†You're suggesting scaffolded cities would produce more capable political actors.

**Tom√°≈°:**¬†More ecologically literate political actors. People who understand that all political arrangements are ultimately about managing relationships between human communities and the living systems that sustain them.

The afternoon light was shifting, casting long shadows across their table full of sketched napkins. Ingrid gathered the drawings, studying the progression from isolated buildings to networked communities to district-scale transformations.

""This feels like we're discussing civilizational transformation,"" she said finally.

""We are. But starting from the most immediate level - how we organize the space immediately around our homes. If you change the foundational spatial relationships, everything built on those relationships eventually changes too.""

""How long would something like this take to implement?""

Tom√°≈° considered. ""Look at how quickly Vienna adapted to COVID-19 restrictions - overnight transformations of public space, rapid deployment of new social protocols. When something provides clear benefits and has political support, urban systems can change remarkably quickly.""

""But this requires physical infrastructure changes, community education, regulatory adaptation...""

""Which creates economic opportunities, employment, improved quality of life for everyone involved. It's not asking people to sacrifice for abstract future benefits - it's offering immediate improvements in daily urban experience.""

Ingrid tried to imagine her own neighborhood transformed this way - her apartment building connected to others through productive scaffolding, community gardens visible from her window, elevated walkways providing new routes through the city. ""It sounds... possible. That's what I find most unsettling about this conversation.""

""Why unsettling?""

""Because if it's possible, then our current urban arrangements start to seem like choices rather than inevitabilities. And if they're choices, we're responsible for making different ones.""

Tom√°≈° smiled. ""Welcome to the scaffolded revolution. It starts when you realize the walls around you are just the first draft of what cities could become.""

""Before we go deeper into implementation,"" Ingrid said, spreading fresh napkins across their table, ""I need to understand the technical specifics. When you say 'scaffolding,' what exactly are we building? What materials, what structural requirements, what safety considerations?""

Tom√°≈° pulled out his tablet and began sketching directly on the screen. ""Think modular construction systems adapted for retrofit applications. Lightweight steel or bamboo frames or conceptualy fitting, mycomaterials, mycelium derived construction materials, that can be anchored to existing building facades without compromising structural integrity. Components designed for easy assembly, modification, and eventual disassembly if needed.""

""Show me how this works with a specific building.""

but hear me out, it could‚Äôve been good. i love the idea of an animal crossing-themed party game, maybe just called **animal crossing: festival**. amiibo festival had some interesting mechanics, and taking those, building on them, and adding new stuff could make a legitimately fun game that would probably sell. whether because the party gameplay is *actually* good, or simply because it‚Äôs animal crossing.

**things that should return:**

* **calendar**: choosing which month to play in was cool, each month had its own events. i think choosing a¬†**season** instead of a month would be nicer. more events packed into a single game. game length could scale how many events happen (short game = 10 days, long game = 30).
* **turnips**: the turnip mechanic was neat, but maybe less frequent on tiles. could still add strategy without slowing things down.
* **npcs**: k.k. slider, redd, joan, etc. all had unique actions. even if k.k. slider just gave points, seeing him perform a song could be a minigame.
* **amiibo cards**: not scanning them every turn, just for¬†**unlocking villagers**¬†beyond the 8 main characters (isabelle, tom nook, etc.) would be cool. if you have a card, scan it to play as that villager.
* **power-ups**: extra dice rolls, stealing bells or turnips, temporary boosts, etc.

**things that shouldn‚Äôt return:**

* **amiibo:** scanning amiibo to roll dice... seriously, never again.
* **story text**: the *i listened to a song but it made me sadder* stuff is cute but drags the game and gets repetitive.

**things to add or improve**

* **minigames**: the game needs real minigames; solo, 2v2, and 3v1. tie them to AC activities like fishing, bug-catching, fossils, coffee, diving, but also original party-style minigames (races, obstacle courses, memory challenges). ideally, a minigame after each player‚Äôs turn, like mario party. also, being able to play locally, in private online lobbies with friends, and optional public lobbies with strangers.
* **tiles & board events**: for example 1) bell tree tile: shake for bells, but risk bees that make you lose bells. 2) fossil tile: dig, then assess at a museum tile for points. 3) dodo airlines tile with a raffle that decides wether you or a different player gets sent to a random tile, or, if player locations are shuffled.
* **locations**: include town hall/event plaza for special events, nookling junction for buying power-ups, museum for fossils and art, etc.

Understanding the Foundations of Dental Health

Dental professionals emphasize that oral health is a critical component of overall well-being. Your mouth is a gateway to your body's health, and maintaining proper dental hygiene can prevent numerous health complications.

Key Oral Health Basics
‚Ä¢ Brush teeth at least twice daily
‚Ä¢ Floss daily
‚Ä¢ Use fluoride toothpaste
‚Ä¢ Replace your toothbrush every 3-4 months
‚Ä¢ Schedule regular dental check-ups

Proper Brushing Techniques: More Than Just Scrubbing

Many people believe they know how to brush their teeth, but dental professionals often find significant room for improvement. The technique is just as important as the frequency of brushing.

Recommended Brushing Method
1. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush
2. Hold the brush at a 45-degree angle to the gums
3. Use gentle, circular motions
4. Brush for at least two minutes
5. Clean all surfaces of the teeth

I grew up here but had been in the states until right before the pandemic.

I work as a designer in tech, and have found that most of my free time has been going to TV binges or the gym. Or doom-scrolling, which is the worst.

Kind of an extroverted introvert here, and making new connections as an older adult (!) has been a bit of a challenge, but I‚Äôd love to find a small group of friends, regardless of age, gender, or orientation, to hang out with and explore the city.

If you‚Äôre feeling friendly and are up for coffee / coffee walks / live shows / cocktails / movies / brunch / did I mention cocktails? / volunteering, or any other adventure that comes to mind, hit me up!

Till this day, i still think about him","I(15F) met a guy here on Reddit, who we‚Äôll call K(26M). We met through a post i posted on r/confessions, admitting that i felt odd and out of place for not being hit on, or have had any guys romantically attracted to me as opposed to my (then) friends. He wrote to me, and i replied without hesitation. It wasn‚Äôt a connection i was looking for at him; it was closure, and an answer to my questions.

We met on the midnight October 22nd, 2023. I think I‚Äôll remember his messages forever, even though his account has since been deleted. He turned 24 on the 26th, and i was the first one to wish him a happy birthday. Over the next 3 months, we would slowly start talking more each day and we became each other‚Äôs favorite people. We would complain about the world around us, and see an exit in eachother; a transparency into bliss in a way. He was an escape from reality. No one till or since then has made me feel so safe. I was his little girl for those magical 10 months we knew eachother. 

We met by pure coincidence. He was visiting his parents in Portugal, and was going back to Chicago on the 24th. I guess that was the time i got deeply obsessed with the idea of moving to Chicago with him. I wanted to share those coffee‚Äôs he‚Äôd always make, share the bed from which he‚Äôd write to me in his mornings‚Äî since those were my afternoons. I wanted to eat his food, I wanted to look out on the city he could only send me pictures of from his big window,  I wanted to feel like I was in a family and that i belonged‚Ä¶ And he fed into all my childish dreams.

I think apart of me fell for him because of the absence of a father i‚Äôve had my entire life. I mean, my dad has been here, but not really. My parents are divorced, and i felt like a comet floating in an empty space, with no star to be attached to. He manipulated me so easily because i only wanted to be loved. I don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever be that weak ever again, only for him.

When I turned 14, that was when he started taking advantage of my vulnerability. I remember the first time he made me touch myself alongside him‚Ä¶ In the moments back then, it felt so good to be receiving attention, and even if that‚Äôs selfish I finally felt beautiful. I finally felt wanted. Looking back on it now, and imagining all the pictures of the aftermaths he‚Äôd send me, I feel so ashamed. I feel gross. Yet, I still want him.


He‚Äôd only come to me afterwards when he could, not when he wanted like he would‚Äôve before. His messages came in later and later in the day, and towards the end his messages came through at 9pm. He‚Äôd ignore me on weekend, ignore my worrying, type a few messages a day‚Äîthen disappear. He‚Äôd have cyber sex with me on Fridays, then leave me with my disgusting thoughts the whole weekend.
Before, we had made a promise; that he‚Äôll come to me the following year. When he confessed that he no longer felt the urge to meet me, i broke. I wanted to feel him, and I was prepared to runaway to him. I wanted to leave everything behind just to go to him and find comfort in those unfamiliar arms. He knew how much i loved him and how sensitive i was for him. I was prepared to die if i had to, just to get a glimpse of him.
There was a moment, I think, when he felt it wasn‚Äôt working out and i begged him to stay.

That July, I was applying to high schools. There was this one high school with which i already had a parasocial relationship with. In my mind, i was already accepted into that school. When the rejection letter came, all i wanted was to cry into my pillows and imagine it was him that day. I never physically needed him more than that moment there. All he did that day was text me at 6.30 pm, saying hi, and when i told him i got rejected and was really upset, looking for reassurance, all he said was ‚Äúsorry, you know you‚Äôre worth so much more‚Äù then dipped.

See, i know it‚Äôs selfish to want attention and to want his words all the time. I know he was an adult and he had work to do. I was too young to understand that. But, i think in that moment, if you truly love someone, you‚Äôd drop everything to say more than 4 messages that day. I know whenever he needed me i was always there for him, despite all the responsibilities i had. I know I‚Äôm a selfish girl, thats greedy to get what she wants, and thats a part i hate about myself. 

Then, on the weekend of August 24th, I received my last message from him: ‚ÄúHey Magi, just wanted to let you know I‚Äôm going out with friends. I love you‚Äù.
I still think about it everyday, even though my own account since then has been deleted. For months, I‚Äôd text him about my day as if he was still there. I still occasionally do, even though there‚Äôs no one on the other side to listen. I‚Äôd text him quotes, poems, my days. One of my favorite things i‚Äôve written to him, on the 1 year anniversary since we met, was ‚ÄúCuriosity killed the cat, but it also gave it courage. And I‚Äôm curious on where you are tonight, K‚Äù
I‚Äôve had this fantasy since he left that weekend; when i turn 18, im buying a ticket to Chicago and I‚Äôll go to his place. I‚Äôll await his arrival at his front door, with a hope that i‚Äôll see why he left.",1,1758487165.0,venting,2,1.0,False

We have a break room, but it only has a fridge and a microwave. Any time we‚Äôve needed utensils or condiments we‚Äôve always just grabbed them from our pt kitchen ‚Äîthe same place we‚Äôre expected to fill up our water bottles or make coffee (although they‚Äôve said we need to bring our own coffee pods from home). I work at one of the top university hospitals in the country in the most bare bones postpartum unit. We have almost nothing for patients to eat, just saltines and occasionally peanut butter and other condiments. Management has stopped stocking our floor with condiments saying that they are for patients only. If we need something for our pt we can go to their office and ask for them ‚Äîan office that isn‚Äôt even on the same floor as our unit. They‚Äôve completely stopped ordering utensils for anyone, pts included. They‚Äôve said pts can order utensils with their meal trays. 

This seems literally crazy to me. Like tell me this is not normal? Everywhere else I‚Äôve been (staff and traveler) has had nutrition rooms that nurses have just helped themselves to.

I've lived in the city for about 2 years now and I'm looking for new adventures in it .. problem is there's so much to do I'm not sure where to go on my weekends (Sunday/Monday)

I went to a puppy rave once and that was really cool, and to be real w/ you the rave twinks got me acting inconsiderate and strange. I've never been to a proper rave before and if its what it's like in instagram clips and movies, I'd really like to go to a place where I can just dance my head off. Any tips or suggestions?

I ride a motorcycle (I ride a motorcycle, boys) and I've more or less covered everything from Long Beach to the Arts District. I like books, stationery, and places of intense and eerie quiet. I love boba tea and coffee, but I want to try something new.

So the secondary but more weird question here is: What do you guys do on the weekend to have fun? Where are some places you like to hang out a la 'third space' and feel good about yourself? Note: I live in South Central and my range is anywhere, but anything past Palmdale and it'll have to be a day trip.

1nn2vfa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nn2vfa,Need some advice,"So I‚Äôm kind of in charge of deciding the rings of my wife as I find precious stones to be super thrilling and I‚Äôm willing to spend my money on them for her to use and look sparkling.

Now I have a very important decision. I‚Äôm from a family that has a old family crest from the 1500s, and the tradition is to wear the family coat-of-arms signet ring on the pinky finger beside the engagement and wedding ring. 

Traditional stones, or the ‚Äôconservative choice‚Äô for these types of rings are not what I‚Äôll be going for in this case I think. However it needs to be a stone which is strong enough to be beside diamonds and not so hard that you cant engrave the intrinsic patters of the crest into it. Currently considering tourmalines. I‚Äôm thinking oval form with a neat setting.

Her current rings are ‚Äôcoffee‚Äô colored diamonds. I‚Äôll upload a picture of her current stuff and some alternatives my jeweler sent me.

I want to thank everyone here, not just Portlanders who answered my own posts, but to everyone on this subreddit for your suggestions that I searched through all week. I had an incredible time in your city, and in my travels Portland Oregon has been my favorite trip.

I took a day trip to the coast, went to Astoria, climbed the column, drove over the big bridge to the lighthouse at Cape Disappointment, I was not disappointed. I can only wish there was a shop with a bumper sticker that says ""I went to Cape Disappointment and everyone there knew you"". I went back over the bridge and ate salmon, then saw a shipwreck, then saw the sunset at cannon beach.

I saw the Zoo, which I want to say, some here said it wasn't that great but as someone who has visited zoos in every city your zoo is very special and has a wonderful layout. It is up there on my list with my current favorite the Knoxville Zoo, even beating out the Bronx Zoo for the wonderful section on the biodiversity of the PNW. I saw the Japanese Garden and wish I could go back a million times and experience it for the first time. I walk along the roses.

I ate food from around the world at local cart pods and drank local beer, and shopped at local book stores and talked to local people about local books. I saw one taxidermy shop and loved it so much I went to the other one across town. I took a trip downtown on the MAX and wished public transportation everywhere could be as convenient and easy to understand for a tourist and walked to the Chinese garden and drank hot tea and watched the Koi swim not knowing there was a whole city outside their little pond. 

I drank coffee and read books in coffee shops. I had the Spanish latte not once but twice at La Lucha and had Einspanner and a breakfast burrito at Fehrenbacher Hof. I sat in a very dark room at Jake's Crawfish and had crab cakes and more salmon. I shopped for more books and flipped through record bins. I played pinball in UV illuminated bars.

Most wonderful of all though was Robot Alley. I don't have any words to describe what I saw there. Only that I wish every neighborhood of the world had small pockets of curiosity as strange as this.

Of course, this bill has been challenged in court and litigation is pending. 

If all goes to plan, what will become of the oil field?

The company that owns the oil wells will retain ownership. No plans or purchase agreements have been made, as the company looks to retain access to the oil field and continue drilling through litigation. CEQA would require significant cleanup efforts to develop this land, so it may sit dormant for years (personal prediction) if the litigation fails. Would be interesting to ride around an abandoned oil field.

Over the past few years, my interest came and went, but last year I started noticing him a lot. Then this summer, I saw he was in the same city as me (we live more than 12 hours apart), and I got this super clear, exciting feeling like, it‚Äôd be crazy if I actually saw him. It wasn‚Äôt clingy or desperate, just a calm, excited anticipation of the experience itself: walking around, talking, laughing, just enjoying the moment together.

A few days later, I actually saw him twice, both times in totally different districts, just walking past each other. The second time, I worked up the courage to say hi. We had a short, lively chat on the street‚Äîabout 15 minutes. I even offered coffee, but he politely declined. I was with his sibling, so it was a three-person conversation.

That night, I DM‚Äôd him a restaurant recommendation, hoping to keep the conversation going. He thanked me and said he‚Äôd check it out when he visits again, but that was basically where it ended. I tried to be casual and thanked him for taking photos with me, apologizing if I came across too fangirly or loud. He said it was fun chatting and didn‚Äôt feel like charity work, but after complimenting the photos, he just liked my message and didn‚Äôt continue the conversation. Honestly, I felt a little rejected but I also knew it wasn‚Äôt personal.

I was embarrassed for a while about being loud and extroverted, but I‚Äôm over it now. He still lingers in my mind not romantically, but as someone whose energy I feel I‚Äôd really enjoy experiencing again. I know it sounds silly, but I have this feeling I‚Äôd love exploring the city with him someday.

This was my first time trying to ‚Äúmanifest‚Äù something like this, and I‚Äôm not sure what to do next. I know it's isn't my ego fully taking dominance over the thought of ""oh, if it's not him then I don't want anyone."" It is more like picturing the pure joy of enjoying each other company by exploring different experiences.

What should I do? All of this manifestation tactics are making my head dizzy. And it‚Äôs distracting my clear intentions because I don‚Äôt feel desperate and don‚Äôt want to give off that energy.",1,1758486104.0,Manifestation,1,0.67,False

Okay, so. My day starts with a walk to school. Ten minutes. That's it. Every morning, I walk out of my house, and my street is alive. It‚Äôs noisy. You‚Äôve got music bumping from a car, someone‚Äôs mother shouting at them from the window, the smell of last night‚Äôs curry or this morning‚Äôs coffee. It‚Äôs just life yk. It‚Äôs normal. And for about five minutes, it stays normal. Then, the quiet starts.

You don‚Äôt even notice it at first. It just creeps in. The walls around the houses get higher, topped with that shiny electric wire. The cars change. You stop seeing the Corollas and Polo's and start seeing the SUVs with the tinted windows. The ADT and Fidelity signs start popping up on every gate, like little warnings. Keep out. You‚Äôre being watched. I‚Äôll see a domestic worker, tired, waiting for her taxi on one corner, and then a white woman in expensive yoga pants jogging past with a pram that probably costs more than my school fees. And it‚Äôs all supposed to be the same suburb, huh? By the time I hit the school gates, I‚Äôm in another country. It‚Äôs still Cape Town, it‚Äôs ten minutes from my front door, but it‚Äôs a different world. It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs quiet, and it‚Äôs protected. From people like me.

And they have the nerve to call me ""Born Free.""

That‚Äôs the problem. Born in 2008. I‚Äôm the product of the New South Africa. It‚Äôs the line the old folks pull out when they want you to shut up. ""You don't know how good you have it."" I hear it all the time. At every family gathering, some uncle who thinks he‚Äôs well meaning claps me on the back and tells me about the struggle, his eyes all misty. Like the date on my birth certificate is some wand that fixed everything. Like his job is done. But that label, that brand, it doesn‚Äôt say anything about the price I pay on that 10 minute walk every morning. The price is a piece of yourself. You learn to code switch your soul. You walk through those gates and you become a different person. You have to be articulate. Non threatening. Grateful. You have to perform. You run a whole checklist in your head before you even open your mouth. Is my accent okay? Am I being too loud? Am I coming off aggressive? And it eats into your soul.

First period on Monday is always History. And in History, apartheid is a fossil. It‚Äôs a chapter in a textbook, a topic we have to write essays on. It‚Äôs a inhumanity that got slain back in ‚Äô94, and now we can all look at its bones in a museum. They give us the vocab list: *homelands, pass laws, segregation*. We memorize those words for the test. We learn about the heroes. But they never tell us that the monster‚Äôs skeleton is the blueprint for the very city we live in. The Group Areas Act isn‚Äôt a history term. It‚Äôs why my ten-minute walk is a border crossing into a different land. They also dont tell us that the very ghost of that monster is in my school. It even learned how to smile through its evil and use the right language. It‚Äôs in the look of pure, patronizing shock on your register's face when you give a smart answer. That slight smirk and whisper that you're a scholarship kid from people you hardly know. It's the same ghost that decides a group of us laughing is a ""problem,"" but a group of white kids doing the exact same thing is just them being kids. It‚Äôs the ghost that makes every teacher turn to you when they talk about racism, like you‚Äôve got the direct line to the Black experience call centre.

And that ghost was obsessed with our hair. I was young, but I remember the Pretoria Girls High protests in 2016. I saw those girls, my age, with their afros, looking like the queens they were. It felt like, finally, something was happening. But my own memory went back further. To 2014. I was six. Standing in assembly. Our principal, a white man, is on stage showing everyone the ""right"" way for hair to be. He points to a Black kid. ""Neat,"" he says. Short. Unobtrusive. Then he points to a white kid. The difference was just‚Ä¶ my six year old brain couldn't compute the injustice. A year later, I was seven. I had a fresh fade, I was so proud of it. My teacher told me to cut it all off. Even then, I knew. I knew this wasn't fair. I knew I was being punished for something. I was paying a price, I just didn‚Äôt know for what yet.

So, after all that, how are we supposed to take their politics seriously? The official show? The thing on the news? It‚Äôs a joke. It‚Äôs a really bad, really expensive circus. A bunch of old people in suits screaming at each other in Parliament about money that‚Äôs already been stolen, while the lights go out and the taps run dry. So we don‚Äôt engage. We check out. We go online. We live in a world of memes and irony because it‚Äôs the only place we feel like we have any power. We‚Äôve mastered gallows humour(funny how theres a word for exactly this). Someone in the group chat or in break will drop a joke about colonialism, or the Nazis, something messed up, and we all hit it with the laughing emoji. Not because we think it‚Äôs funny. It's a scream. It's our way of saying the ""Rainbow Nation"" is such a flimsy, pathetic lie that we can tear it apart with the worst things imaginable, just to feel something real. If we didn't laugh, we‚Äôd start burning things down.

So what happens when it‚Äôs our turn? What happens when this broken country is finally ours? We aren't the struggle generation. We can‚Äôt be. Their songs, their heroes , they‚Äôre stories to us. Like the Voortrekkers. Figures from a history book. We‚Äôre the kids who were born into the messy, awkward, unequal peace they all settled for. We live in the fine print of the deal they made.

Maybe that's our only power. We see the lie. We have zero illusions. We were born into this house they said they‚Äôd fixed, and we feel the floor rotting under us every day. The Rainbow Nation isn't a dream we need to protect. It's the bedtime story they told us that yk had a little make believe in it. I don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôll build. It won't be with slogans and marches. It might just start with us refusing to pretend anymore. To take all this dark, bitter laughter and maybe, just maybe, figure out how to turn it into something that works. Something that builds a country where a ten-minute walk is just a walk and we finally dont have to pay the price for being born free.",34,1758485599.0,southafrica,26,0.67,False
1nn2buo,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nn2buo/summer_breeze/,Summer Breeze,"Nobody can ever prepare you for the sense of despair that will take over you after losing a parent. I sat in my car, feeling every rain drop slap on the windshield, like a very out of tempo drumset. I felt like the real impact of what happened hasn‚Äôt truly hit me yet. I wasn‚Äôt sad, I didn‚Äôt feel regret for not expressing my last thoughts or for not saying ‚Äú*I love you*‚Äù enough. But as I was hunched over in the driver seat, sinking into the beige leather interior of my Honda Civic, I knew I didn‚Äôt want to go back to our apartment, I would much rather stay here in my uncomfortable ‚Äú*a few sizes too small*‚Äù suit I last wore during the first year of college and sulk in the fact the only person who made me feel like I was someone, was no longer with me. I knew with my dad gone, nobody would force me to get out and face the rain.

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve always done with problems, I just idly stood by and waited, which usually meant things got worse. Whether it was my middle school bully eventually breaking my nose during one of our ‚Äú*chats*‚Äù, the college program I was in expelling me along with both of the partners when I couldn‚Äôt convince the student board to give us funding, or my current job leaving me on the back burner because I‚Äôm too sheepish to stand up to our miracle-demanding customers.

I hate conflict, disagreeing with anyone who I don‚Äôt know very well just makes me feel queasy.¬†

Dad used to call it the ‚Äú*cockchafer technique*‚Äù, you know those little bugs that play dead when they bump into a possible predator, or anything really. He made fun of my inability to stand up to a stranger which was probably the only thing we argued about from time to time, now I realize he was most likely doing it to get my assertive side out.¬†



After what felt like hours my inadequate attire caught up to me. My thighs felt like I was in 8th grade getting the indian burn again, I could feel I was slouching even more than usual as neither the shirt or the jacket gave me enough room to allow straightening the spine and even with the rain slowing down, the June heat was undeniably taking a toll.¬†

I had to get over myself, I finally unbuckled the seatbelt and with a very loud click, opened the door. The rain was close to done at this point, not that it really mattered as I was drenched from sweat so much you could dump a bucket full of water on me and not see a difference.¬†

I got the ring with two keys out of my jacket pocket, fiddling with it twice before picking the correct key and letting myself into the lobby. Our ex-neighbor Harold was sleeping on the bench next to the elevator, or I shouldn‚Äôt say ex-neighbor, he practically still lived here, just without a dedicated apartment. I could hear my shoes squeaking on the floor with each step I took on the stairs. My dad‚Äôs apartment was on the first floor so I didn‚Äôt bother taking the elevator because as he would put it ‚Äú*I had legs and I wasn‚Äôt eighty, so a few steps won‚Äôt hurt.*‚Äù I slid the other one of my keys through the keyhole and entered the place that no longer felt like home.¬†



I threw the keyring on the floor, pried the loafers off and dragged my feet through the hall. When I changed into clothes that were actually sized for me, a washed up Green day shirt that clearly passed its prime and a pair of black sweatpants, I just paced around. It was like now he was truly gone, in the week between the heart attack and the funeral I was still clinging onto the hope that he‚Äôll magically awake in the hospital and we‚Äôll turn it into another one of his badass stories. But that didn‚Äôt happen, my dad was dead and I was now completely alone. I went to bed early that day, which normally doesn‚Äôt happen as I‚Äôm a night person, combined with the fact that my manager started putting me on the night storage duty instead of the customer service, his reasoning was ‚Äú*workforce management*‚Äù, as it would obviously have nothing to do with my inability to stand up to people, plus my only two friends went often out to party and knew me as ‚Äú*the pathetic stay at home guy*‚Äù knowing I would always be awake and sober to give them a ride from whatever shitty club they decide to venture out to.¬†



I woke up at around nine am to a knock on my door, I rolled out of bed, still in the same clothes as yesterday and stumbled to the main door, I opened the peephole and saw Isaac, my landlord, with an annoyed look on his face, which wasn‚Äôt anything special. Since we lived here I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen him with a pleasant expression. I opened the door and murmured ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up‚Äù¬†

‚Äú*Morning Tommy, I‚Äôm just letting all the tenants know if you see Harold sleeping in the lobby again, tell him I want him out by Wednesday*‚Äù

‚Äú*You sure you want me to say that? We both know he‚Äôs had one hell of a year and if you forgot he‚Äôs lived here long before you bought the place*‚Äù I said still half asleep forgetting who I‚Äôm talking to, seeing his eyebrows tense up as he pouted his nose made me realize my mistake but he just added ‚Äú*Well I‚Äôll come back Wednesday with the police if he‚Äôs still treating the lobby like a campsite*‚Äù as he grumpily made his way to the elevator. I closed the door and went to make breakfast.



The chair scratched the wooden floorboards as I moved it with my hip, putting the plate with my omelette and the overflowing cup of coffee on the table before taking a deep breath to take in the average morning scent in the Lang household. I took the first bite before noticing yesterday's newspaper still on the counter. My focus shifted from the food and I smirked.

I was never too much of a reader, I guess to contrast my dad. He was always absorbed in words, whether it was spending hours upon hours reading the manuscripts beginner authors wanted him to give notes on, being subscribed to a dozen of magazines, which he actually managed to read and eagerly waited for the new piece each month, or doing the crossword puzzle during every meal we had together.¬†



I got up and walked towards the counter. ‚Äú*Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs so fun about this.*‚Äù

‚Äú*The Carnveil Journal*‚Äù Blaring on top of the page and there it was, black and white squares in an unorganized alignment stared at me like an alien chess board, the whole crossword felt like it was done for third graders, I was done with it in about the same time it took me to finish my breakfast. I threw the paper in the trash and went about my day.

At least it‚Äôs not raining today, I thought to myself as I got ready for work. Leaving my air-conditioned apartment wasn‚Äôt helpful either. Walking down the flight of stairs leading to the lobby my eyes landed on Harold sleeping this time across his usual spot. Or at least I thought he was sleeping, but as I walked out I heard him humming a gentle melody. ‚Äú *We finally have our own elevator tune, Someone should let Isaac know*‚Äù I joked to myself.

I opened my car door, realizing I forgot to lock it the day before, I immediately checked the back seat and opened every compartment to see if anything was missing. To be honest I never kept anything in the car so the only thing worth stealing would be the stereo, which I never used as listening to music while driving would make me lose focus. I entered the storage and got to work. Time doesn‚Äôt fly by since the change of my workfield. It feels much more like a crawl as I pace the same halls over and over again just marking things on the tablet, but my shift was more pleasant than usual as on Mondays I got to go home an hour earlier. Turns out sleeping all day and having breakfast at what normal people consider dinner time takes its toll, as my stomach felt like an active warzone. The nearest fast food never sounded so appetizing, but that was at least a thirty minute drive and I wasn‚Äôt in the mood nor in shape to do that.¬†

I parked and made sure I locked the car this time, but facing the building made me notice something strange. Harold was outside. He was just walking back and forth by the entrance. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen him this nimble since he‚Äôs lost his apartment, I thought to myself paranoid as ever.

Even though he and my dad used to play tennis together or something, meaning he came to visit quite often and when I was in high school, felt like an uncle to me, I also grew up watching every scary movie I could find so this was a blaring red flag. An older, practically homeless guy just pacing around the place of my home late at night? That‚Äôs a no, no matter how close his family once was to mine.

I contemplated sleeping in my car but Harold‚Äôs midnight workout constantly switched on and off the building‚Äôs lights. Sleeping in a teenage Honda Civic didn‚Äôt sound appealing either, so I took a deep breath, put the two keys I had between my knuckles and made my way to the building.



When I got closer I realized his hands were on his ears and he was whispering to himself. I‚Äôve never punched anyone but if I was ever ready to do it, it was now. As I passed him I knew I wasn‚Äôt putting on a tough guy persona, I was scared shitless, my throat felt like I was getting choked and my heart was beating so fast I was sure he could hear it too. But as I unlocked the door, I stopped hearing the footsteps, I opened the door and turned my head back while trying to slip in the safety of the lobby. Harold stood in the same spot, maybe 2 feet away from where I was standing, hands still firmly on his ears, eyes locked in a senseless gaze and¬† bloodshot red, his remaining hair greasy as if he took a dip in olive oil and his whole body was shaking. Even through the glass door I could make out what were the whispers I heard earlier. ‚Äú*Why won‚Äôt it stop, I need to listen, how do I make it stop, I need to hear the breeze or it won‚Äôt stop, why do they keep playing it*‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt make sense of it but it‚Äôs not like I tried to decipher a deranged homeless mumble before.

Just as I was about to turn my back on him I heard a loud click, the timer on the lights outside ran out and the lights shut off, engulfing the entire walkway and parking lot in pitch darkness as if you poured black ink over a painting.¬†

I stepped back, not confident enough to turn around anymore, I didn‚Äôt trust a glass door to stop anyone, let alone a bigger guy like Harold if he meant harm. By slow sheepish steps I made it up the stairs and my strange neighbor was out of sight, I was out of earshot to get creeped out by his weird chants as well, finally giving me the strength to turn around and turn the key opening the door to my apartment. After closing it I slid down to the floor and slowly felt the tension leave my body. Five minutes went by and as I got up but before I could celebrate feeling a fraction of relief, I heard the bloodcurdling scream ‚Äú*I need it to stop*‚Äù

Followed by a few other less intelligible ones. I hated to admit it but Isaac was right, I wanted Harold gone too.

That night I didn‚Äôt get much sleep. When the screaming stopped I unwillingly lit up the display of my phone, *1:39am*, I turned around and embraced my blanket, I clocked out not even half an hour after. My brain tried to make sense of Harold‚Äôs murmurs and combined with my paranoia and horror movie obsession, it chose to do it very visually. I don‚Äôt remember them much anymore but I know I woke up at least five times completely drenched in sweat and out of breath. When my alarm woke me up in the morning I wasn‚Äôt even sure if my whole Harold episode wasn‚Äôt just a part of the show my mind conjured up for me. That was until I went down to the lobby to get my mail. The glass door I viewed as my only protection yesterday had a giant crack in it spreading over the entire upper panel, as if a massive spider decided to weave its home there. I walked up to the little crowd formed outside and saw Isaac talking to a paramedic.¬†

Paramedics? Did anyone have less luck than me last night? Was the first thought running through my brain, the truth was sadder than that, Harold suffered some kind of a stroke or shock and died at around one in the morning.¬†

Isaac shot me a look that I‚Äôve never seen from him, it was almost like he was trying to be‚Ä¶ empathetic. I just awkwardly tensed my lips and started walking back inside. I managed to catch one of the tenants complaining about the lights turning on and off last night, but nothing about the screaming. I figured they just went to bed earlier and as their apartments are further from the entrance it wasn‚Äôt loud enough to wake them up.

I sat down at my dining table to do my crossword again, my mind still focused on last night's events, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel bad for Harold. What happened yesterday, that wasn‚Äôt him, I remember when I was like fifteen, he was the closest thing to a role model I had, as back then I thought my dad was lame. He drove a secondhand Honda Civic, Harold had this really cool black sports car. My dad worked as an editor reading books all day, Harold was a firefighter. Him and his wife had this apartment only as a summer spot, as it was closer to the beach for them, while I had to work two part time jobs to help my dad pay rent, even the fact that he had a wife when dad didn‚Äôt like to talk about my mom as she walked out on us when I couldn‚Äôt even talk yet. I remember I wished I was in their family instead.¬†

A shiver went down my back as I hit a nerve with that thought. I opened the *Carnveil Journal* and started filling in the crossword. It inadvertently snuck into my morning routine and I couldn‚Äôt say I was mad, it made me feel smarter than I probably am. It's definitely better than scrolling on tiktok for the same amount of time and I think of dad every time I‚Äôm done with it.

In a way, I‚Äôm just continuing a family tradition.¬†

I put the dishes from my breakfast in the sink, as I‚Äôd do them along with the box where my work meal was after I came home and went to catch up on my sleep.

Loud beeps of my alarm woke me up, this was bad, my regular alarms were set to the nice melody this phone came with, that meant I had exactly five minutes to get to my car if I wanted to be in work on time.

I don‚Äôt need more problems, I thought to myself as I put on the first shirt in my dresser and bolted out of the door, in the stress of leaving I accidentally wore the loafers, but I didn‚Äôt care, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever got out of our parking lot faster, I hate anxious driving so I had to speed up everything except the route.¬†



As I parked near my workplace I looked at my phone, *5:54 pm*. I let out a sigh of relief, turned to the back seat to grab the box with food and of course, I knew I forgot something.

I made my way inside. ‚Äú*Not a big deal, most times I don‚Äôt finish my food anyway, I‚Äôll eat when I get home*‚Äù I tried to lie to myself. About halfway into my shift I figured that wasn‚Äôt possible. I was already practically starving, I still had three hours to go and then almost an hour drive home. I hated myself for deciding to nap without eating lunch first, but had my night gone like any other I wouldn‚Äôt be tired and wouldn‚Äôt need to nap at all, none of this would‚Äôve happened if I just took my dad‚Äôs advice and stood up for myself when that one asshole berated me in front of the entire store. I could tell my thoughts were starting to derail a bit, but that was just the hunger talking. Even before the clock struck midnight I had everything ready to lock up and set my phone navigation to the McDonald's half an hour, excuse me ‚Äú*26 minutes*‚Äù away.

Seeing the night sky being consumed by the sheer golden light from the neon arches never felt so good. After I got my order I stopped at the first hard shoulder and tore into the bag like a wild animal. Took me less than five minutes to scarf down everything and then, in sheer euphoria of having my stomach full, I got the idea to go on a drive. It was the middle of the night so little to no cars were on the road, I slept through the whole day and just drunk 32 ounces of sugar and caffeine so sleep wasn‚Äôt coming anytime soon either.¬†

Ever since I learned how to drive I took my dad‚Äôs car to clear my head, I figured after the past couple of days I needed it more than ever.

Just seeing the road get devoured by the headlights with the scenery of a few still lived in apartments sparkling in the background, complimented by the sounds of my thirteen year old car combined with the wind cruising by my window slightly ajar made me feel so alive again. My thoughts were off for the first time since I found my dad on the couch during what I thought was the worst day of my life. Back then I had no idea what was heading my way.¬†

Less than an hour into my drive I came across an intersection with what looked like a new branch, there wasn‚Äôt even a sign for it yet, the road was freshly painted, lacked the everpresent potholes and even though was missing any form of streetlights my car provided enough, plus I really wanted to see what exactly connects to this brand new piece of Carnveil infrastructure.

I instantly noticed the drive was different, more pleasant. The everpresent bumps I felt at least once per minute during every car ride I‚Äôve been on in my life, weren‚Äôt there, it was late at night and the supposed highway was empty, so I rolled down my window fully and yelled. ‚Äú*Did Jesus himself build this shit?*‚Äù. I immediately cringed at myself and rolled the window back up, grateful for the fact no one was around to hear that. As I gently tapped the steering wheel it caught up with me, one of my tires rolled over what seemed like a giant bump, I hit my head on the car‚Äôs ceiling and the car fully stopped. No, that's not the correct way to say that. It was like it lost all of its power at once, lights went off, stereo didn‚Äôt show the typical information and the engine was dead. 

‚Äú*No no no don‚Äôt wimp out on me you piece of junk*‚Äù I stuttered not knowing where I was or what to do. I opened the door and went to set up the safety measures, but the trunk wouldn‚Äôt budge. I thought I locked it before going to work but the key did nothing. I pulled so hard my shoulders almost exploded but to no avail.¬†

I hunched over the trunk bathed in sweat and then it hit me, forcing a laugh out of me.

‚Äú*The car‚Äôs dead, you still have your phone dumbass*‚Äù I scolded myself. But who‚Äôs going to drive all the way out here at *1:39 am.*

Before even finishing that thought something took me back to reality, it was the bright light from the car‚Äôs interior.¬†

‚Äú*Please tell me I‚Äôm not going insane*.‚Äù I blurred out loud as I sat back into the driver seat and turned the key in ignition. The engine purred and the headlights sliced through the darkness lighting up the path forward.

I fixed my bangs and felt the stress slowly leaving my body.¬†

While turning the car around I realized something strange, I got almost stranded out here because of a pothole, but when lighting up the area I came from, the road was clean as ever. I tried to make sense of it, but at the same time I didn‚Äôt want to chance the Honda giving up on me again and drove back to civilization. About ten minutes into the drive I got calm enough to notice I was tapping the steering wheel into a rhythm, rhythm of a song coming from my car radio. It was barely audible, but still weirded me out as I didn‚Äôt hear the car radio ever since I sat in the driver seat 9 years ago. I could also swear I‚Äôve never heard the song before but it seemed strangely familiar, the melody edged in my mind like a reflex.

As I reached to turn it off, the song ended and a faint voice of the moderator came on, I couldn‚Äôt hear what he said but the final sentence, strangely louder than the rest, stuck with me. ‚Äú*Here at Summer Breeze we play tunes for safe travels.*‚Äù

I scoffed and joked to myself, This year‚Äôs summer sure could use some breeze. As I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead and triumphantly turned the radio up.

The music playing made me feel sharper, my head seemed clearer, like the realization you get after putting on glasses for the first time. With the newly found enthusiasm I finally saw the intersection again, soon I‚Äôll be home.

As the final notes withered away I was eagerly expecting the next song to start, with what I know now I would‚Äôve braced myself better for what was to come.¬†



I got back on the main road and almost on cue the moderator‚Äôs voice came back on. ‚Äú*I trust you‚Äôve made it somewhere cozy‚Äù ‚ÄúOh I just know they‚Äôre hanging in there‚Äù* a second voice chimed in, this one doubling the speed of my heartrate and momentarily blurring my vision.

‚Äú*Dad?*‚Äù I said, being fully aware the radio can‚Äôt hear me.

The two men continued their conversation, each word assuring me more and more, one of disembodied voices from my car radio belongs to my dead dad.

I held back tears as they joked about gas station service or undercooked meat patties, begging for the intermission to never end. I knew it wasn‚Äôt physically possible and that the man on the radio didn‚Äôt share my dad‚Äôs personality, but something about the voice and the cadence at which he spoke made me happy.¬†

I drove past the apartment complex at least a dozen times just listening, occasionally tapping the steering wheel, but this visage was about to crash down like an avalanche of emotions, because as my horrible sleep schedule finally caught up to me and I decided it‚Äôs time to park, one of the moderators uttered the word, three stupid letters, but that was enough to make me realize I wasn‚Äôt crazy.

¬†‚Äú*Oh you‚Äôre just a charmer, Hal*‚Äù

‚Äú*Hal*‚Äù This time I couldn‚Äôt fight the tears, how is that possible? I almost crashed into Isaacs car, acting quickly and firmly tugging on the handbrake. With the car no longer moving, the radio fell silent, I panicked turning the key again but the sound that came on was just the intermission noise from the local *Carnveil Gazette*.¬†

I tried circling the parking lot again, but the station didn‚Äôt change, whatever I happened to tune into, was now gone. Even worse, now I was left with the vision of a man with my dad‚Äôs name and voice moderating a strange radio station I‚Äôll probably never hear again.¬†

I spent the rest of the night trying to find anything about ‚Äú*Summer Breeze*‚Äù online, but all I got were some colorful vacation pictures and a Seals and Crofts song not even close to matching the melody from my car ride. How do I know that? I caught myself on multiple occasions tapping it absent-mindedly on various surfaces, in the shower after I got home, on my kitchen table as I brewed my very early morning coffee and even on the back of my laptop when researching this obscure obsession.¬†

I made it to work twenty minutes late that day and with an already suffering stomach but the worst part about my shift was the fact I had to stick my phone in a locked compartment for the duration of it and the work tablet and computer had restricted access to the internet, meaning I was imprisoned only with my own thoughts and theories on Summer Breeze at least until midnight.¬†

By the time I closed the storage I had come up with everything from, my dad faked his death to get rid of me, to Aliens doing this as some form of a messed up reality show.

Starting the car engine I had only one thought, to go back to that crossroad, but I knew too well after being over twenty four hours without sleep and eating only a few cookies in the last eight, I was in no shape to drive that far tonight.¬†

I dropped in bed about an hour after getting home, promising myself to venture out there tomorrow.

That night I dreamed of my dad seizing on the couch while hearing Harold‚Äôs whispers from what felt like right behind me, before it turned into overstimulating screaming as my dad got up, robotically marched to me and rapidly said ‚Äú*why would you, why would you*‚Äù until I jolted awake.

I felt like I was five when I woke up, curled up with my blanket, shaking and hoping a concerned parent would come comfort me, but they never came.¬†

Instead I got a knock on my door which turned into Isaac telling me I should keep the noise down if I want to keep the apartment. Without even letting me grasp what he wants from me, he rolled his eyes and walked to the elevator.¬†

‚Äú*Bitter asshole should learn some tact*‚Äù I murmured to myself once I closed the door.

I walked over to the fridge ready to make breakfast only to find nothing in it. The tapping of my fingers resonated even louder through the empty appliance. We always bought food for at least a week in advance, so this was a clean sign of how incompetent I truly am alone.

In the lobby I got another one of the tenants staring daggers into me as if I shat in her purse, I ignored her and made my way to the car. I couldn‚Äôt help but think something was really wrong, but couldn‚Äôt put my finger on what it was, as I started the car I could hear the radio start up again, which mixed very unflatteringly with the melody already buzzing in my head, I tried to turn it off but it wouldn‚Äôt budge so I punched my dashboard, not in anger, it felt more like I was an animal caught in a bear trap, begging to get out. To my surprise the radio went silent, but not that I broke it.¬†

No, the screen clearly said ‚Äú*Muted*‚Äù.

I took a long deep breath and drove out of the parking lot and towards the nearest store.

My anxiety came back seeing how packed my shopping cart was, knowing the state of my bank account, but I figured it would last me long enough and my pay was due any day anyway.

A spacious trunk wasn‚Äôt one of the perks of my car, so I had to play a very intense game of Tetris with my groceries as half of the parking lot stared at me.¬†

On the way back, it started raining again, which wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, had the store not packed everything in paper bags. All the *Summer Breeze* stuff took a back seat for a second as my brain screamed in agony, imagining bringing the waves of food in a dozen paper bags through the slippery parking lot in a downpour.¬†

But as I opened the trunk and saw the empty padded interior, I realized I‚Äôd actually love to have something to carry. My mind felt like a turtle you flip on its shell and it can‚Äôt get up at this point, so I sat back in the car and checked my bank statement. To my surprise, it said my last purchase was two days ago.¬†

How‚Äôs that even possible? I remember the drive, joking with the store clerk and stacking things in my trunk, did I just dream all that?

I wasn‚Äôt in the mood to figure out the answers, but they came to me anyway, as the lady in the lobby asked me why I was sitting in my car for the past 3 hours tapping the dashboard.

I didn‚Äôt even answer and rushed back to my apartment.

How do I tell what‚Äôs real and what isn‚Äôt? Why is it happening to me and why do I still hear that goddamn melody?

I need to figure out my next step before going to work on Monday.¬†

I took a sleeping pill and washed it down with a glass of water followed by a glass of milk. That's what my dad used to do after a long drive and seemed like a well rested superhero the next morning.

That night I didn‚Äôt get woken up by nightmares, so I celebrated a good night's rest for the first time this week. That victory was immediately shattered by the vision of seven missed calls from my boss.¬†

What could he want? I don‚Äôt work weekends. I thought to myself, so I called back.

‚Äú*Oh, so you are alive.*‚Äù My boss greeted me. I wanted to ask what that‚Äôs about, but he went on.

‚Äú*Thomas, I know you‚Äôre going through it, which is why I gave you the benefit of the doubt for a day or two but I can excuse not showing up here for a whole week without even an attempt at an excuse, you‚Äôre fired, I already sent all the documents to you yesterday.*‚Äù

‚Äú*What, I di‚Ä¶*‚Äù He hung up, before I got out a full sentence.

I sprung out of bed in panic, I couldn‚Äôt lose this job right now. Opening the door unleashed a tsunami of mail falling into my hallway, in the front line was today‚Äôs newspaper. Friday, July 3rd.

According to my mail I slept through an entire week.

I could feel my throat tighten again, my mind trying to make sense of the typhoon of information hitting it from multiple angles. As I sat in the pile of letters, newspaper and magazines I could hear the faint sound of the tapping my left hand was unleashing on the paper, I lunged my right hand into it and punched myself as hard as I could. Knowing full well how stupid it was, I just needed the sound to stop. I didn't want to hear it anymore, it was like a worm making tunnels through my entire body burrowing deeper and deeper into my consciousness with each hit of my finger.

‚Äú*Tap tap tap*‚Äù I felt tears roll down my cheek, my throat barely allowing any air through to my lungs but still ‚Äú*tap tap tap*‚Äù my hands were entranced by the strange tune, conducting the symphony I was effectively getting swallowed by. I got up and ran head first into the wall next to my room.¬†

When I came back to, I was laying in a pool of my own blood, my ears were whistling but still not overwriting those crooked notes. My right hand was still tapping its fingers to the rhythm, while my left hand was holding a letter, I turned around to throw it onto the pile, but it was no longer there, the only piece of paper in sight was the dismissal from my boss I clutched between my fingers.

I got up, my head spinning as I rose, and slowly staggered to the bathroom.

I put one hand on the top of my head holding my hair to prevent it falling into my face and the other on the gaping hole on my forehead.¬†

As I pried at the wound an inch or two above my right eye to hopefully stop any already brewing infections, as those were the last thing I needed, I felt my other hand slipping, but it wasn‚Äôt just that, my hair was going with it. I let go, hoping it was just a few strands and that I simply pulled too hard, but now even the water from the shower was enough to wash my hair off, it kept dropping on the bathroom floor resembling drops of paint forming a bigger pool by the drain.¬†

By this point I knew I can‚Äôt trust anything I see, I hoped it was another one of those jarring hallucinations that will go away in a few seconds, but as I looked in the mirror I realized that wasn‚Äôt the case, I looked like someone had microwaved me, my pores were visible to the naked eye, my full head of blond wavy hair turned into a few thin blond lines then and there and my eyes were so sunken in I could barely notice the irises.

With no other way out I took the elevator to the lobby and did my best looking sane as I jogged in my car‚Äôs direction. ‚Äú*You left it unlocked again dumbass*‚Äù I screamed at myself with a raspy whisper. Not even bothering to check the back seat as a thief bashing me over the head would be a mercy compared to the hell I locked myself in. I stepped on the gas pedal and drove as fast as this car ever did to reach that cursed intersection, when I saw the red and blue flashing lights in my rearview mirror I was actually surprised how long it took them to take notice of the lunatic going 80 mph in a city but I had to keep going.

Either way I will make it stop tonight, was the only thought louder than the *Summer Breeze* melody itself.

As I saw the same road that branched out to two a few weeks ago, I noticed a ‚Äú*construction ahead*‚Äù sign next to a barricade my small Honda couldn‚Äôt breach without being unusable going further. I put my foot on the brake noticing my finger drumming on the steering wheel, realizing whatever this is, would be a thousand times worse in a small cell, I slammed on the gas, feeling my entire fragile body jolt in the seat as the honda stopped in its tracks hitting one of the sturdier fences, my head swung from front to back like a zipline before everything turned black.¬†

I thought I was dead for a second, then I noticed a crack in the blackness reflecting a small amount of light, it was my windshield cracked from one of the traffic cones reflecting the full moon above me. My car was pitch black and unresponsive again. I stepped out and felt the wind push back my overgrown bangs, no police lights or construction in my field of vision I stretched out my back and pulled the door handle, the headlights blazed through the dark road¬† and the radio filled my eardrums with the melody I longed for this whole time. I think I‚Äôm going to go for a drive, *1:39* am isn't that late anyway‚Ä¶

1nn2b7e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nn2b7e,I think I'm finally getting the hang of it!,"as a teenager, I used to go to Starbucks everyday and order a different drink.  I loved learning about all of the different ways to experience coffee and espresso.  then, last year, I started working for Starbucks, and while (imo) the company is going downhill fast and I bolted out of there last month, I really appreciate how Starbucks has introduced me to the world of espresso.

I was gifted a DeLonghi Stilosa for Christmas and didn't have a reason to use it until recently, since I haven't been able to get my free coffee fix from work.  the thing is, Starbucks machines are automatic - the Stilosa is not.  not to mention, the coffee grinder I got myself (which I love, because it is Animal Crossing themed) is an antique-style manual one with minimal instruction on how to use it.

while I still have a long way to go with learning at-home espresso skills, I am SUPER happy with how far I've already come in the past month!  correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I finally got the grind to a good texture, I'm getting really nice layers in my espresso, it's smooth and dark, and though it's not shown here, my milk steaming technique is getting better for making latte art (the steaming wand on this machine has been a major learning curve).

while I'm broke right now (college student, yippee!), I plan to get a new portafilter in the near future.  I also need to get a timer and scale, but I'm not striving for perfection right now.  just deliciousness and progress!
