1he3irl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Epilepsy/comments/1he3irl/tips_and_tricks_for_stay_at_emu/,Tips and Tricks for stay at EMU,"Hi everyone,

The week of Christmas I’ll be checked into the EMU at UAB hospital. I have a general idea of what it will be like, but I think it’s something you can’t really understand until you’re there, you know?

That being said: does anyone have any tips they wish they knew before they went?

I know many have suggested the best shampoo for getting the EEG gunk out but I can’t remember. I plan to re-binge watch SVU with my husband. I’m packing PJs with button up shirt and zip up onsies only. I also am packing tons of stuff to make handmade embroidery gifts for my family. 

My biggest fear is, will I be able to drink Coke and coffee? I’m just a girl who needs a cup of coffee every morning and a Coke for diner every night lol. 

Also while you’re here; does anyone else have experience with UAB’s epilepsy department? I hear great things about the hospital in general, but you never know. 

Thanks!",1,1734185024.0,Epilepsy,0,1.0,False
1he3hlk,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1he3hlk/returned_protector_ch_23/,Returned Protector ch 23,"Orlan paused as he took a sip of the coffee on his meeting room table, at least once a week he liked to have these meetings just to ensure his protectorate was running smoothly without issues. The kitchen staff usually provided breakfast and drinks for the meeting, but there was something odd about this coffee.

“It’s coffee we got from the locals, my lord,” one of the staffers explained, seeing his expression.

“Quite a bit… stronger than what we have on the other side,” Orlan commented.

“The knights have been split on the taste,” the woman agreed with a knowing smile as she finished setting a platter of pastries, “everyone has approved of everything else though, my lord, the chefs were especially impressed by the sugar.”

“Thanks,” Orlan nodded, returning her smile as he grabbed a roll and sat down. The rest of the senior staff filing in, from his own senior most knights to the grandmaster of the mage’s spire and a few elders from the town. The last to arrive was Theo, who’d been invited as a guest by Orlan, partly so he could see how the protectorate functioned, and partly because one of the issues was Amy and her Aunt.

“Adalee broke through to the third sphere a couple nights ago,” Lady White reported, “so far she’s doing well with the changes.”

“She uses dream mana right?” Orlan asked, the old warhorse of a woman nodding, “makes sense she broke through at night then.”

“She was asleep at the time, my lord,” White agreed, “nearly destroyed her bedroom unfortunately, nothing valuable was lost though. Other than her, I think the gem sisters, Ruby and Topaz are ready to push for forth sphere, both of them have stabilized in the Earthly Realm, but…”

“But?”

“I’m afraid they might hold off to wait for miss Amy to catch up, they’ve really taken to her.”

“Any suggestions?” Orlan asked, eyeing his coffee suspiciously as he debated whether to refill it or not.

“Offer Topaz a bond if she makes it to forth sphere,” White said immediately, clearly having anticipated the question, “Ruby is still too… immature to bond safely, but seeing her sister do so should motivate Ruby to work at it.”

“Any chance it’ll drive a wedge between them?” Lailra asked.

“No, I’m certain that, if miss Topaz bonds with you successfully, she’ll immediately turn around and assist both Ruby and Amy in moving forward.”

“I’ll want to test Topaz before allowing the bond,” Orlan said, “but beyond that I’ve no objections.”

“I’ve a question,” Theo spoke up for the first time, on his third cup of coffee and having gone through several pastries, “this bond you speak of, how long until Amy is… considered ready for it?”

“At least a couple years,” Orlan replied, “she has to be at least third sphere, but I’d prefer if she made it to fourth before testing her.”

“So not an immediate issue, alright,” Theo sighed, “her Aunt is applying quite a bit of pressure through the media to get her niece back. I’ve told my staff back in Washington to get the paperwork started to declare her an adult, but we’ll probably need to go to court.”

“Anything we can do on this side?”

“I heard the bond thing was akin to marriage, if she was going to bond soon she could apply for dual citizenship,” Theo shrugged, “other than that, she might have to appear in court.”

“For one, the bond isn’t a marriage, the other side just puts them on the same level legally,” Orlan sighed, palming his forehead, “it’s a technicality my knights love to tease me with.”

“Oh calm down, honey,” Lailra said with a teasing smile, “surely you aren’t implying you don’t want to be married to us.”

“See what I mean?” Orlan asked, giving Theo a dry look.

“Oh, I’m hurt!” Lailra replied in mock surprise, holding a hand to her chest, “to think you’d be so rude to your wife!”

“Right,” Theo said, equally confused and amused as he glanced between the two, “in any case, Amy might need to appear in court if her aunt really pushes the issue. And if that happens you know the media will be all over it.”

“Can’t ya just ignore ‘em Lord?” one of the older men at the table asked, he was one of the village elders and possibly the longest non-magic wielding inhabitant of the protectorate, “let ‘em squawk.”

“Unfortunately the US has quite a bit of military power that can be deployed even against us here,” Orlan replied, “including some explosives of, well, apocalyptic potential. Even I don’t know if I can protect the island from a nuke.”

“That you might be able to at all scares me,” Theo commented, “regardless, avoiding conflict is in everyone’s interest, so I’ll do what I can. All I need to know is, if she needs to appear in court, will she be able to?”

“Depending on where the court is, probably,” Orlan replied after a moment, “our cutters can reach North Carolina from here, where I assume the court will be, but just barely.”

“She could take a plane, drop her off at whatever airport is closest and I should be able to get her a flight back,” Theo offered.

“I’ll have to think about that, I don’t want to put her at risk of being kidnapped or attacked.”

“Could we send some other knights with her?” Lailra asked, “for security?”

“Not sure how the media will play that, but it’s possible,” Theo said after a moment’s thought, “the final option is a remote appearance, using facetime or something. Apparently, they allow that now, I’d have to talk to some of the youngsters in my staff about it though. The judge might not like that however.”

“You can call in to court appointments now?” Orlan asked, looking surprised, “technology. Anyways, anything else to bring up Lady White?”

“No, my lord, I saved the issue of the gem sisters for last because I knew we’d be derailed,” Lady White replied.

“Great, next up… Master Henri?”

“Been a couple complaints about the god-awful racket that gen-er-a-tor thing been makin,” the old villager drawled as the meeting moved on.

\-\-\-\-\-

“Alright,” Orlan said a few hours later, “last issue, Grandmaster?”

“Right, I’ve got two things,” the old wizard said with only a slight scowl at the title, “first off, the others tell me the academy is ready for an initial class of twenty at any time. We should be able to take on twice that number if we get some apprentices from the first.”

“You teaching?”

“I’ll consider an apprentice if someone awakens to weather mana,” the old man snorted, “students will be arriving in a few days right?”

“Assuming everything goes well,” Theo nodded as Orlan gave him a look.

“Great, second issue… I got some mages together and we did a complete assay of that eye.”

“Ifn yall are gonna talk magic, can I go?” Henri asked, standing and bowing to Orlan after getting a nod before walking out along with the two other elders.

“Should I stay?” Theo asked.

“You got us into this,” Orlan said, nodding for the Grandmaster to continue.

“Alright, first up, our initial assay was correct, the item’s aura provides insight at a cost,” the Grandmaster said, a spell circle appearing around the coffee pot with a wave of his hand, causing the now cold drink to heat up once more, “beyond that the item seems to have four active abilities.

“The first is the one alluded to by the stories, it can form a spell link with any representation of itself, within a narrow band of allowed deviation. A ritual is required to ‘attune’ the eye with a specific symbol, such as the ‘eye of providence’ or ‘eye of Horus.’ Only one symbol can be ‘attuned’ at any given time, we think, but it can link to any instance of that symbol, anywhere in the world.”

“Even if I were to simply draw an eye in a triangle, it would link with it?” Orlan asked.

“Yes, assuming it’s attuned to that symbol. At the current time, we’re pretty sure that’s what the attunement is,” the Grandmaster confirmed, “the second ability is based on the first, basically any magic effecting the eye is passed on to any linked symbol, though at a greatly diluted strength.”

“Wait,” Orlan stiffened, “the aura?”

“Yes, anything carrying the Eye of Providence symbol will have a weak aura of insight,” the old man nodded gravely, “based on research by Lady Nallia and I, the Eye was adopted by the United States as part of its seal shortly after the nation was founded, and was placed on the one dollar bank note close to a century ago. But it would have been common on government documents before then. And, based on what we can tell, the United States have been at the forefront of technological development for the last few hundred years.”

“A lot of other nations have also kept up or pushed science forward,” Theo replied.

“Yes, it’s hard to tell how much of the technological advancement is thanks to the Eye of Providence or just human ingenuity,” the Grandmaster nodded, “but I will point out that government documents, and later bank notes, will have spread to other countries beyond the United States. Best I can tell, all the discoveries and advancements likely would have happened eventually, this magic simply sped the process up. It would also explain why this side is so much more advanced beyond the other.”

“And the cost?” Orlan asked.

“Also hard to tell, the cost can be literally anything. For all I know the Great War that happened on this side a bit over a century ago was part of the cost, or maybe it wasn’t. I don’t know, even the direct aura is very subtle, but spread across so many people in a diluted fashion?” the Grandmaster shrugged helplessly, “but that’s not what worries me the most. What concerns me, is that there is a spell active on the Eye. It’s weak, enough that it was hidden by the aura of the item, but it’s there. And due to the Eye’s property, it will have spread to every representation of the Eye.”

“What’s the spell do?”

“It’s surprisingly simple,” the Grandmaster said, lifting a hand, summoning two spell circles and filling them with runes, “it’s a mental magic spell that introduces a single thought, very subtly to anyone who comes in contact with it.”

“What thought?” Orlan asked, leaning forward to inspect the spell, “and that’s a mind magic spell? It looks like baby’s first spell from how it’s set up.”

“Ya, like I said, it’s very simple and shows very poor understanding of runes, likely because they don’t have access to as many mages on this side,” the Grandmaster nodded, “all it does is whisper very softly in the back of someone’s mind, gently nudging them towards a thought. And that thought… is ‘magic isn’t real.’”

Everyone froze at the implication, their minds racing.

“Why that thought?” Orlan asked after a moment.

“My best guess? To hide themselves, they didn’t have the knowledge to manage anything complex, so they used it to cover up their own influence. From what Master Theo has told us, the group who had this item has been using magic, but we don’t know to what end. Exposing enough people to this spell, no matter how subtle the influence, for long enough can cause people to rationalize even the most blatant magic. It might be why people have been so hard to believe in magic, even after encountering us,” the Grandmaster said.

“That actually makes sense,” Lady White spoke up suddenly, “when she first came here, miss Amy had trouble believing in magic, even as we demonstrated it to her. It took her effort to avoid attempting to explain it away. I figured it was just due to growing up in a world without magic, and that may be part of it, but…”

“What about after awakening?” Orlan asked, “she still show the same difficulty?”

“No, she still expresses disbelief on occasion, but hasn’t had the same issue. That could be due to breaking free of this spell, or because she now has her own magic she can feel.”

“The human mind is complex,” the Grandmaster agreed, “I spoke to several mages who study mental magic, and they concluded that we’d likely never know the true extent of how this spell effected the world.”

“Can we shut it off at least?” Orlan asked.

“We can, but I’m not sure we should,” the older mage said slowly, “for one, most people have lived under the effects of this magic for their entire lives, we don’t know what will happen if we suddenly remove it. The others agreed with this, the effects could be minor and subtle, but we don’t know. The more pressing issue is that, while the spell is so weak that it doesn’t really harm those with a mana allergy, if we disable it suddenly the mana could backwash into people.

“Secondly, we don’t know how the sudden loss of the insight aura will change the world. Most likely it’ll continue collecting whatever debt it’s built up, but won’t provide any more insights. My suggestion is we study the item to find a way to safely dispel both effects.”

“Alright,” Orlan said, not sounding happy about it, finally giving up and reaching for the coffee pot, “you mentioned two other abilities?”

“Right, those are less troubling, the third allows it to break down the aura of a person or another item and display its component parts. Like how a prism breaks apart light. If read properly it can be used to tell quite a lot about something. I think this is what they were going to use on you when you were captured. The final ability allows the user to see through any representation of the Eye, basically shifting your point of view to that of an attuned symbol. This works over any distance, as long as you know where you want to look the Eye will put you in the place of the closest symbol.”

“Why risk such an important item on me?” Orlan asked after a moment, “clearly this item was central to their operations, why use it?”

“It may have once been important, but it lost value recently,” Theo was the one to speak up this time, earning looks from everyone else, “you said its making people think ‘magic isn’t real’ right? Well, how long will that hold out when magic is becoming more and more common? You’re promising to teach it to people, more rifts are appearing every month. Any value it had in hiding their magic whatever is diminishing quickly.”

“They may have also thought the aura decomposition ability would allow them to learn more about magic,” the Grandmaster added, nodding at the other man, “clearly their knowledge of practical magic is lacking, using an item that is rapidly becoming less effective to try and learn something seems like a bet worth taking.”

“Could it have actually helped them?” Orlan asked.

“To an extent, it helps with mana types, affinities and the like, but you can’t use it to view Soul Runes, which is what they’d actually need to expand their spell casting. It might have helped them find out how to do that, however.”

“Well, for now look for a way to safely disable the item,” Orlan said after a moment, sipping at his coffee, “anything else?”

“Actually, yes,” Theo spoke up again as everyone else shook their heads, “got a call from…”

“The Sons of Kayeen?” Orlan offered as the congressman glanced at the others in the room.

“Ya, they’re willing to meet you here if you pick them up.”

Can The King of Pop Shape Your Success as a Business Mom?,"https://preview.redd.it/nq3zu8qu8etd1.png?width=1784&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc5a7bd7df5051e732a073016b7e4fae0f50d25f

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

Much like **Michael Jackson** was crowned the ***King of Pop***, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to become **the Queen of your business.**  Don’t let juggling nap times and conference calls hold you back.  In fact, if ***Michael Jackson*** could write ***Billie Jean*** while building a theme park in his backyard, then surely you can **build a six-figure business** while managing playdates.  

So, do you want to learn ***MJ’s real secrets*** **to success** and apply them to your ***MomPreneur*** journey?  Then grab a copy of ***MomPreneurs*** today.  It might not teach you how to ***Moonwalk***, but it ***will*** teach you how to hustle like the ***King of Pop***. [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

***\*Disclaimer:*** *While this blog post is an absurd exaggeration for comedic purposes, Michael Jackson was indeed an entrepreneurial genius.  However, we cannot confirm that he negotiated business deals with llamas, moonwalked through corporate meetings, or attended PTA events.  But you, dear reader, may certainly be able to conquer the entrepreneurial world like the King of Pop.

1he3gn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1he3gn4/the_disciplinemotivation_dilemma/,The Discipline-Motivation Dilemma,"Let’s chat about something that seems to bump heads more often than a couple of deer in rut season: discipline and motivation. We’ve all had those days where we wake up, pound a couple of cups of coffee, and feel like we could conquer the world. Motivation is high—you might even feel like you could do a marathon or, at the very least, get your laundry folded. But here’s the reality check: that kind of motivation is as fleeting as my New Year’s resolution to hit the gym every day. 

Discipline, on the other hand, is like a trusted friend who shows up at your door even when you’re both too tired to party. It patiently waits while motivation throws a tantrum or heads out for a pinky swear with procrastination. Discipline sticks around for the long haul—even when the going gets tough or life decides to throw a pie in your face.

So how do we build this glorious discipline and make it stick like an unwanted piece of gum on a hot summer day? Here are a few strategies that have worked for me, and I suspect they might just do wonders for you too.

1. **Start Small, Think Big**: It’s tempting to jump on the challenge of losing ten pounds in one week or writing a novel in a month. Trust me, I know the feeling—just don’t. Start small. Maybe aim to walk for ten minutes a day. Or, if you’re trying to write, give yourself a mere 200 words. These baby steps aren’t just manageable; they build confidence. They’re like training wheels for your habits.

2. **Create a Routine**: Incorporating habits into a routine is like adding peanut butter to jelly—kind of a game changer. Pair your new habit with something you already do. Brush your teeth, and then meditate for two minutes. Drink your morning coffee while you jot down three things you’re grateful for. That anchoring makes it easier to stick.

3. **Be Your Own Cheerleader**: Motivation tends to be a bit of a flake, but you can root for yourself even when that pesky motivation dips. Keep track of your progress, no matter how small. Make a visual chart, celebrate those little victories—hey, I even have “I Nailed It” stickers that I reward myself with. You'd be astounded at the power of a glittery reminder.

4. **The Power of Community**: Let’s bring in the power of people—the more, the merrier! Share your goals with friends or join a group that can keep you accountable. When I decided to tackle my reading goals, I joined a book club, and let me tell you, the motivation that comes from being surrounded by other bookworms is unbeatable. Plus, they will remind you, in a gentle but firm way, to put down the Netflix remote. 

5. **Give Yourself Grace**: And here’s the kicker—give yourself grace when you stumble. We’re all human, after all. That whole sliding backward thing? It happens. But instead of throwing in the towel and diving headfirst into a pint of ice cream (though I’m a fan of that too, just in moderation), assess what caused the misstep and keep on keeping on.

In the great adventure of life, it’s not always the roaring signal of motivation that gets us to the finish line; it’s the steadfast engine of discipline chugging along, often unnoticed. So, whether it’s building a new routine, developing habits that stick, or inviting others on this journey—a little discipline goes a long way. And who knows, you might find that the journey is just as thrilling as the destination. It’s time to lace up those shoes and get started!",1,1734184858.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I live in NW Washington DC (Foggy Bottom) & I’ve been seeing strange lights in the sky here for weeks now but nobody believes me!

On the morning of 12/12/24 i was reading the news about the ""drones"" and all the other places people have been seeing strange things in the sky and I looked toward my balcony door.

After I finished making my coffee I decided i’m gonna go out check out the sky for myself and do my due diligence as a citizen lol.

I walk outside, close the door and look up to see the most brilliantly luminous star i’ve ever seen… and then it started moving.  
I am an avid sky watcher and live near many airports, i can spot the difference.   
this UFO was at least 4-500 feet up. 100% not a satellite, plane or chopper.   
this wasn't an aircraft; it was a floating ball of light.

The sky above me is know as the DC FRZ (Flight Restricted Zone) and is one of the if not the single most controlled airspace on earth, drones are illegal to fly here.  
This happened about 1.5 miles from the Pentagon and under a mile from the White House. The object was travelling east.

got my phone out as fast as possible. flight data on my page and at the end of video.  
thanks for reading.

1he3d41,https://www.reddit.com/r/kolkata/comments/1he3d41/the_portrait_of_an_indian_man_as_a_young_divorcee/,The Portrait of an Indian Man as a Young Divorcee,"He sits in his office chair, the ergonomic kind that’s supposed to be good for his back. His spine doesn’t agree. Ankylosing Spondylitis—the doctors said his bones were fusing together, slowly turning him into a human sculpture. He stretches, winces, and goes back to staring at the document on his screen. A deadline looms. There’s always a deadline.

The phone buzzes on the table. It’s his mom’s message on WhatsApp. “I don’t like the way they talk about you.” He has left all the family WhatsApp groups after the divorce to make it easier for the uncles and the aunties to gossip about him. The same aunties and uncles, the same tired refrain. “It’s no wonder she left him. Four years and no kids!” Must be impotent - being the underlying message. As if the hours he spent hunched over his laptop, clawing his way from a nobody to a somebody, meant nothing. As if the sacrifices he made were invisible, even to her.

He pours another cup of chai. His hands shake as he stirs it. It’s the exhaustion. The kind that wraps around your chest like a rope, pulling tighter with every breath. He used to drink coffee, the kind she made him every morning. But he gave that up somewhere along the line, along with everything else that wasn’t work.

When he met her, he was 22, broke, and full of dreams too big for his wallet. She wanted a house in Bangalore—a place of their own in a city where the rent bled you dry before you even unpacked. She had big dreams too, but they were practical. Dreams with numbers attached. And she was almost blind, her eyesight hanging by a thread. He thought about that a lot. About what would happen to her if he wasn’t there, if he didn’t build something solid before his body gave out.

So he worked. He wrote. And he got good at it—really good. From 15k to 50k to 7 figures in just under four years. He was the guy people called when they needed words that could sell anything. The guy who turned sentences into money, who made the impossible seem attainable with a well-placed metaphor.

But with every pay raise, he got a little crazier about work. He told himself it was for her, for them. He imagined the house they’d buy, the vacations they’d take, the safety net he was building brick by brick. He wanted to give her everything she deserved, but in the process, he gave her nothing she needed.

The long nights at his desk turned into longer weeks away. The deadlines piled up, and so did the silences. He thought she understood. She said she did, at first. But eventually, her patience wore thin. She told him she felt abandoned. That he was in the room but never really there. He nodded, promised to do better, then went right back to his laptop.

When her father landed in the ICU, she begged him to come. He wanted to, but there was a campaign launch the next morning. A big one. He told himself he’d make it up to her later. That she’d understand why he had to stay. But later never came.

She signed the papers a few months after that. He didn’t fight her. What would have been the point? She’d already spent years fighting for him to notice her, to choose her over his work, and he’d failed every single time.

Now, he lives in a sterile apartment with no photos on the walls and no coffee on the stove. The house in Bangalore? He could buy it now, cash down, but what would be the point? The dream had always included her. Without her, it was just bricks and mortar.

The phone buzzes again. Mom again, she has been tired of defending him against the endless stream of whispers. She tells me that she says he is a hard worker, a good son, that the divorce was mutual. She doesn’t say impotent, but he knows that’s the subtext. In their world, no man who works 16-hour days and still loses his wife can possibly be whole.

He closes the chat. The words sting, but not as much as the memory of her voice on the phone, trembling as she told him she couldn’t do it anymore. Not as much as the empty side of the bed he still wakes up to every morning.

The work is still there, waiting. It’s the only thing that hasn’t left him. He rolls up his sleeves and gets back to it, typing until his fingers ache. He tells himself he’s writing for her. That the next paycheck will make her proud, wherever she is.

But deep down, he knows he’s just writing to fill the silence. To keep from hearing her say goodbye, over and over again.",4,1734184544.0,kolkata,5,0.83,False

1he3cjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/agileideation/comments/1he3cjc/the_case_for_digital_detox_why_disconnecting/,📵✨ The Case for Digital Detox: Why Disconnecting Matters More Than Ever,"In a world that's constantly connected, it's easy to feel overwhelmed by the never-ending stream of notifications, emails, and social media updates. We’ve become accustomed to living life through screens, but the toll it takes on our mental and emotional well-being is real. #DigitalDetoxDecember is a reminder that sometimes, we need to step away from our devices and reclaim our attention, our focus, and our peace of mind.

If you're reading this, take a moment to ask yourself: When was the last time you truly unplugged? Not just turning your phone to silent or putting it face down, but actually setting it aside for a meaningful period. We often underestimate the impact that constant connectivity has on our stress levels, productivity, and even our relationships. This isn't about rejecting technology altogether—it’s about making intentional choices to prioritize real-world experiences and human connections over screen time.

🌱 Why Consider a Digital Detox?
Research has shown that excessive screen time is linked to higher stress, decreased focus, and poorer sleep quality. Technology itself isn’t the enemy—it’s how we use it. A digital detox doesn’t have to mean a full break from all devices; even small, manageable steps can lead to significant improvements in our well-being. By setting boundaries with technology, we can create space for deeper relaxation, better mental clarity, and a more balanced life.

📋 Practical Tips to Start Your Digital Detox Journey:
Create Tech-Free Spaces in Your Home: Designate certain areas, like the bedroom or dining room, as digital-free zones. This can help improve your sleep quality and encourage meaningful conversations without the distraction of devices.
Set Time Limits for Screen Use: Establish specific windows of time when you'll check your phone or computer, such as during your morning coffee or lunch break. Outside of those times, resist the urge to scroll or reply to messages.
Explore Offline Activities You Enjoy: Whether it’s reading a physical book, taking up a creative hobby, or simply enjoying the outdoors, fill your time with activities that don’t involve screens. This can be a great way to reconnect with interests that may have been sidelined.
Practice Mindful Technology Use: When you do need to use your devices, be present and intentional about it. Avoid multitasking across different apps and give your full attention to one task at a time. This can help reduce cognitive overload and increase productivity.
🧘‍♂️ Weekend Challenge: Try a Mini Digital Detox
If the idea of a full digital detox feels overwhelming, start small. This weekend, commit to one tech-free activity: it could be turning off notifications for an afternoon, enjoying a screen-free meal with friends or family, or setting a timer to read for 30 minutes without any digital interruptions. Notice how you feel afterward—do you feel more relaxed, more present, or maybe even more energized?

🌿 The Bigger Picture: It’s About Balance, Not Elimination
The goal isn’t to eliminate technology from your life; it’s about finding a healthier balance where technology serves you, rather than overwhelms you. Being intentional with our digital habits allows us to enjoy the benefits of technology while still making time for offline experiences that nourish our well-being.

If you find yourself constantly reaching for your phone out of habit, or if you feel anxious when you're not connected, it might be time to reassess your relationship with technology. This isn't about guilt or judgment—it's about self-awareness and making choices that contribute to a fulfilling life.

👉 Let’s Discuss: How Do You Find Balance with Technology?
Have you tried a digital detox before? What worked for you, and what didn’t? Share your experiences, challenges, or tips in the comments. Let’s support each other in finding ways to navigate the digital world more mindfully.

Bagel Shop](https://toastedseattle.com/) offers a different way to get your Instagrammable coffee shop fix.

  
An oasis in a somewhat bagel-less city, Toasted. is the new Instagrammable, X-able, Pintrestable, write-home-to-your-momable bagel shop and cafe in the U-District. 

The founders are two recent UW graduates from the Paccar Business School, Jaafar Altameemi and Murat Akyüz. After graduating in 2023, the owners got to work on their entrepreneurial dreams. They found property at 4756 15th Ave. NE, on a buzzing corner in the U-District, and set out to make it their very own bagel shop.  

“We believed in the fact that it would happen,” said Jaafar. 

After nearly a year and a half of setbacks in construction due to maintenance and building permits, TOASTED. opened on July 27, 2025. 

Since then, it’s been a blazing success—and we don’t mean their competition, Blazin Bagels —Murat says they sold out on the first day and usually sell out by 1:30 p.m. to 2 p.m. every day. 

So what’s so special about TOASTED.? 

Why are folks flocking to get that round delight?

Lately, I’ve been reflecting on how dark-hearted people can be. As someone with a good heart, I genuinely try to help when I can. But it’s heartbreaking how some people take advantage of kindness for their own benefit.

It’s even more upsetting when bitterness comes from those closest to you—family or friends. Ever visited someone and felt like even the tea or coffee they offered came from a place of resentment? Not because you’ve done anything wrong, but simply because they harbor unnecessary bitterness.

And then there’s the lack of gratitude. A simple “Thank you” for the smallest gestures—a ride, a cup of coffee, a date, a helping hand, even a phone call—goes a long way in making someone feel appreciated. Those two words cost nothing but mean everything.

Kindness and appreciation are small acts that can truly change how we connect with others. Let’s not let negativity overshadow those values. Just my thoughts for the evening.

Lyle exited the bathroom, drying his short hair and thick beard with a towel. A hot bath after a long day in the fields helped relax his sore muscles. He could hear chatter coming from the living room.

As the sweet smell of maple filled his mouth, Lyle swung open the door to the living room, greeting his sister and grandmother.

“There you are. I’ve made you some coffee.” his grandmother said, pointing at the mug on the table.

“Thanks, Nan,” Lyle replied while pulling out a chair at the front of the table.

His dog ran around the table, sniffing in hopes of finding loose crumbs. Lyle and his grandmother often joked that they didn’t need to sweep the floor since the dog would eat every crumb that fell on it.

“Porky! Piss off, there’s nothing for you there.” The man nudged the dog as it concluded its third lap around the table.

The dog huffed and went to lie by the door. Lyle turned to his sister while sipping his coffee.  
“So, how’s work at the inn?”

“Oh, I’ve quit,” she replied.  
“They’ve been pushing me around too damn much, enough is enough.”

Her brother just nodded, supporting her decision.  
“Fair enough, from what you’ve told me over the past few months, I’m surprised that place is still open.”

“Yeah, they’ve been threatening to fire me for weeks now. Well, let’s see how they handle the holiday season without their best barmaid.” She sipped her drink, the look on her face showing a mix of triumph and anger towards her previous employers.

“They did pay you, right?” Lyle asked.

“Yeah. Ghislan, the inn’s head waiter told me to wait until I received my pay and then quit that same day. Which is what I did.” Daria replied with a grin.

“Got something else lined up?” Nan asked.

Lyle’s sister turned her attention to their grandma.

“Yeah. I’ve gotten a job as a receptionist at another inn. Something a bit more refined.” She replied.

“Good, good.” Lyle nodded, taking a long inhale from his pipe and blowing towards his sister.

“Don’t do that.” She waved a hand in front of her face to disperse the smoke.

Lyle simply smiled an annoying smile, one that older brothers would always make when purposely getting on their younger sibling’s nerves.  
The conversation went on, meandering through topics until it reached the most important one. Lunch, or in their case dinner, as the sun had already half set.

“Gosh, look at the time. Would you kids like to eat?” Nan asked, getting up from her seat.

The siblings exchanged a look, nodding simultaneously and getting up to help their grandmother set up the table. His sister’s visit usually happened on the weekends, as that’s when she was free from work, so Nan would always prepare a larger-than-usual meal.  
As Lyle lived alone with their grandmother, he loved whenever his sister would visit, with or without her fiancé, and they all had a big family dinner.  
The conversation continued throughout the meal, laughter filling the room. Ever so often Lyle or Daria would toss a piece of meat or bread to the dog who inhaled the treats without so much as chewing. By the time they were done, the sun had fully set, the moon and the stars shining in the clear night sky.  
After the table was cleared up Lyle relit his pipe and leaned back in his chair.

“When do you gotta go?” He asked Daria.

“In a while. Half an hour maybe. Jaske should be finishing work around then and we’ll meet up in town before heading home.” she replied.

“Why don’t you walk with her Lyle?” Nan said.

If he were a year younger, Lyle would’ve protested, not wanting to go all the way to town and then walk all the way back by himself, especially after spending most of his day in the fields. He’d rather stay home to relax after dinner with a good book. But lately, he has become less opposed to his duties as an older brother. Even his temperament and approach to arguments with his sister became aimed at deescalating the situation, rather than winning the argument. That change in his thought process did not go unnoticed by him.

*“Must be something that happens to everyone when they reach the first quarter of their life.”* Lyle would often say to himself whenever thinking about his change in character.

“Sure. I’ll go.” He replied without fuss or second thought. His sister would appreciate it and the book he’s reading won’t grow legs and run away anyways.

They sat around the table for a while longer to let the food they just ate settle.

 

\*\*\*

 

“See ya, Grandma.” Daria hugged her grandma, took the food the old woman packed for Jaske and heading out the door. Lyle followed and closed the door as the two left the house.

The night was chilly, with a gentle autumn breeze. Daria wore clothes typical for someone living in town. She had a particular taste for darker, more expensive-looking clothes, a stark contrast to her hair, which was dyed blonde. Lyle on the other hand didn’t care much for dressing up, unless he was doing so for a special occasion. Wearing his usual day clothes, brown pants, a plain shirt, boots, and a regular brown cloak, he looked exactly like someone who worked in the fields.  
Despite being three years younger, Daria was as tall as her brother. When they were younger, people would often confuse them for twins.

They talked in more detail about the topics from earlier. Without grandma present, the siblings could swear a bit more without fear of her scolding.  
“When did you two get so foul-mouthed?” Nan would always say, whenever one of them would cuss.

Approaching the main road just outside of town, houses and stores became more frequent. Most of them were closed for the day, but Daria spotted a bakery that was still open.

“Wanna get something sweet? My treat,” she asked Lyle.

“Sure, if you got enough money for it, Chonkus,” he replied, not being one to turn down sweets.

“Yeah, told ya I got paid,” she replied as they both headed inside the bakery.

After getting their order, they both stepped outside and headed up the road to town again.  
His sister steered the conversation towards her plans for the future, talking about things like pension and health insurance. Lyle offered his advice on the topic since working in the fields meant he had to cover those on his own, rather than have them covered by the employer.

“Hopefully once I start working in the new inn, I’ll be able to apply for insurance or maternity,” Daria said.

“You can always pay your own insurance in one of the guilds. Pretty sure you can open a pension account in the bank and pay that yourself as well. Just mind the taxes.” Lyle answered.

“So, I just walk in and tell them ‘Hey, I want to open an account and pay my own maternity’?” his sister asked, genuinely curious.

“I don’t know how it works for maternity. Why would you want to open maternity? Just get health insurance.” Lyle looked at her as they walked, feeling it odd that she was so focused on it.

His sister looked dead ahead, silent for a moment.  
“Because you’re going to be an uncle.” She said before picking up pace, leaving her brother stunned.

Lyle thought his ears were lying to him, as he caught up with his sister.  
“Bullshit. Really?”

“Mhm. Nan already knows. I wanted to wait, have a shirt or something made that said ‘You’re gonna be an uncle’ and give it to you when I announced it to the rest of the family, but I couldn’t hold it in.” his sister answered with a smile.

The man was as shocked as he was overjoyed, walking up to his sister and hugging her awkwardly. Processing emotions was never his strong suit.

“Awww.” his sister smiled and returned the hug.

“Yeah, yeah.” Lyle cleared his throat.  
“Is everything alright? I mean health-wise?”

“Yep. I went to get checked out the other day.” Daria replied.

Lyle stopped walking, looking around for a moment, before spotting a tree. With a quick pace, he walked over to it, knocking on it three times with his right hand. He was, despite outward appearances, quite the superstitious man.  
“Who else knows?”

“Nan, you and Jaske’s mom. We will tell everyone else later.”

“I see. Congrats. Should I congratulate Jaske?” He asked.

“You could,” Daria replied.

“No, not yet. I’ll wait after you announce it officially. I don’t wanna jinx it or anything.” Lyle decided.

“Mom’s gonna flip out. Even now she’s suspecting, telling me to be super careful, to go to the doctor.” his sister said, sighing deeply.

Lyle was no longer on speaking terms with his mother, due to vastly different views on the majority of life’s topics. His sister, more empathetic, still worked to maintain the relationship with their mother, taking on that enormous challenge the siblings once shared, by herself.

“It’s not that big a deal. It’s not like you’re alone in all of this. You’ve got Nan, me, our uncle, Jaske’s family.” He assured her.

The two sat on a bench, talking some more about it while waiting for the fiancé to show up.  
When he arrived, Lyle and the sister’s fiancé exchanged pleasantries and chatted some more, while Lyle internally debated whether to congratulate the man or not, but finally chose against it. He didn’t want to jinx anything with premature congratulations.

“It’s getting late. I’m gonna head back. You two stay safe now.” Lyle said, bidding the two goodbye and heading back down the road towards the outskirts of the town.

From a nearby tavern, music could be heard, so the man sat down outside to listen while mulling over everything that happened. He knew he wouldn’t be a great father; he had no interest in settling down. Chasing village girls through the fields under the night sky or wooing town maidens ten years older than him, was all the romantics and attachments Lyle needed in life. But an uncle? That was a whole different bag. What kind of uncle would he be? An average one? A cool one? Probably the former. His life was painfully mundane if anything. Not that he disliked it, it was the piece and quiet he didn’t have during his teenage years. He dropped out of the Royal University after studying for three years. Perhaps if he had continued, Uncle Lyle would have been on the road to becoming an archmage by now. But working the fields was just fine by him.

Lyle stood up, the music now clashing with the thoughts in his mind, creating noise in his head. He slowly made his way back home, thinking about how the rest of the family would react to the good news, imagining their joy and surprise. The train of thought shifted to his younger self, remembering how he planned to live a life of adventure, to disappear from the town he spent his entire life in and return one day as a legend, someone who had countless stories to tell during family dinners, to have his sister and friends in constant awe whenever they hear a new story from his journeys. To have his future nephews and nieces think of him as the coolest uncle any kid could have.

Lyle opened the door to his house, letting the dog out to do its business, while he lit his pipe.  
All his thoughts swirled as the smoke left his pipe, arriving at one conclusion. He was out of time, he thought this moment wouldn’t come for another few years, five if he was lucky. But alas, his nephews and nieces will have to settle for having an average uncle, who spent his golden years working in the fields. Not a bad life in the slightest, just not many stories to tell.

*“Hey kids, wanna hear a story about the time your uncle pulled out a massive cabbage from the field? There was a mole right under it, still clinging to the roots! Can you imagine?”* He cringed at the very thought. No kid would want to hear a lame story like that.

The embers of his former self, once enamoured by adventure and desire to travel the world, began to heat up. What did he have to lose if he went on an adventure now? His house won’t disappear, his nan was not so old that she couldn’t take care of herself and the home. She’d be a little lonely, sure, but she has plenty of family members and neighbours paying her daily visits already. Plus, Porky would be there to keep her company.

Lyle let the dog back inside before going to the bathroom to wash his hands and feet. With that done, he went to bed, still thinking about what adventure he could embark upon if he were to go. His skin felt tight, the fire of ambition that he thought had long since died out now blazing like an inferno inside him. A younger him clawing from within, screaming his dreams into Lyle’s mind. He grabbed the book, but could not find the peace or focus to read it, instead merely staring at the hand-drawn cover art. The winged fire-breathing beast of legends stared back at him from the image. His eyes widened, all the fire within him forming into an idea, one crazy and almost impossible, but worthy of stories and legends.

*“That’s it! I’m going to slay a dragon before my niece or nephew is born. I’ll become the most famous uncle in the entire kingdom!”*

*“You idiot. You’ll get eaten alive. Then what stories will be there to tell?”*

*“I’ll send letters and drawings to my sister, each month, with stories of what I’m doing! That way even if I don’t slay a dragon, at least there will still be plenty of stories from my travels.”*

No matter what argument his brain came up with, Lyle was too far gone to be discouraged. He hopped out of bed to write a goodbye letter for Nan, since he planned to be gone before sunrise. The soreness of his muscles told him to go back to bed and sleep past sunrise. Lyle obliged and laid back down, turning off the small mana stone lantern on his nightstand, and drifting off to sleep.",2,1734184166.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1he35xu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlueLock/comments/1he35xu/analysis_how_long_did_the_nel_matches_last_is/,Analysis: how long did the NEL matches last & is BLTV worf? ,"Just to make it perfectly clear from the onset, this is not meant seriously.

As we all know, the NEL matches don't have a set time limit - in theory, they could be going at it for days on end until they're granted the sweet release of someone finally scoring their team's third goal. According to the explanations the manga has given us, we have no reason to assume that the length of a NEL match would be anything like a standard 90-minute match. So that of course begs the question: how long does a NEL match take?

Fortunately, we have one means to approximate the length of the matches (or, at least, the ones featuring Bastard München): the 3-minute star change system. We know that the amount of time that the master strikers are on the field is exactly three minutes. This gives us a means to guess at the duration of the matches in their entirety.

So to conduct this 100% scientific analysis, I propose to adopt the following axiom: that time passes, on average, at an equal pace during the three-minute timeslot where the master strikers take the field as during the rest of the match.

This is not to say that time passes equally quickly during every scene, every page, every chapter, etc. in universe. To draw on terms from narratology, we must obviously distinguish between fabula time (the amount of time something takes in universe) and syuzhet time (the amount of time a narrative takes to depict a certain moment). Like any narrative, Blue Lock has moments where syuzhet time is shorter than fabula time (characters dashing to the other side of the field within the span of a page) and moments where syuzhet time is longer than fabula time (for instance during inner monologues or flashbacks, when it takes multiple pages to depict something that in-universe unfolds in a matter of seconds). I fully acknowledge all of this; my working assumption is simply that, on average, the pace of Blue Lock's narrative does not significantly differ between the period where the master strikers take the field and the rest of the match. (if someone feels like properly tallying this, I'd love to see your findings though!)

So, long-winded preamble out of the way, let's run some numbers.

**Barcha**

The match starts in ch 159 and ends in ch 167. The master strikers sub in during ch 163 and sub out in ch 166. This means that of the 9 chapters, the master strikers are present for 4 of them. So if 4 chapters factually take place within the span of 3 minutes, we must conclude that on average, 45 seconds pass by during each chapter of the Barcha match. This means that the other 5 chapters of the Barcha match pass by in 3 minutes and 45 seconds, with the entire match lasting approximately 6 minutes and 45 seconds. Or to put it differently, there's a goal being scored roughly every 1 minute and 20 seconds.

**Manshine**

The match starts in ch 174. The master strikers sub in during ch 193 and remain on the pitch until the match concludes in ch 202. So the match takes 29 chapters, with the three minutes featuring the master strikers occupying 10 of them. Since, again, these 10 chapters canonically last 3 minutes, this means that in Manshine, a single chapter spans 18 seconds. I guess the lads were just moving really slowly during Barcha or so, but then again, speed and rush is the Manshine motto. In any case, this means that the remainder of the Manshine match took 5 minutes and 42 seconds. The match in its entirely lasted just 8 minutes and 42 seconds, and it took an average of 104 seconds to score a goal.

**Ubers**

The match starts in ch 210 and ends in ch 238. The master strikers sub in during ch 222 and sub out during ch 230. This means that of its 29 chapters, the master strikers are on the field for 9 chapters. Therefore, the Ubers match took place at a slightly more relaxed pace than the previous one, tallying an average 20 seconds per chapter. In conclusion: on top of the 3 minutes featuring the master strikers, we get 6 minutes and 40 seconds without them, bringing the total duration of the Ubers match up to 9 minutes and 40 seconds. And on average, it took 116 seconds to score a goal.

**PXG**

Obviously the match has not finished yet, so this is as of the most recent chapter (287). The match starts in ch 249. The master strikers enter the field during ch 277 and leave in ch 283. That means they've been playing for 7 chapters, whereas the match as a whole has lasted 39 chapters to date. Time in PXG chapters really flies by compared to the previous chapters: one chapter covers a full 26 seconds. And more than that, PXG has been an absolute slugfest. The time without the master strikers would, as of the current chapter, amount to 13 minutes and 52 seconds, so for the entire match so far, we have been watching a full 16 minutes and 52 before our eyes. The average BLTV viewer must have been falling asleep given the absolute lack of action: it's taking these lazy buggers a full 4 minutes and 13 seconds (on average) to score a goal. Total snooze-fest!

**Appendix: should you cancel your BLTV subscription?**

All that begs the question: is Jinpachi Ego ripping off his viewers big-time?

The answer to this is, in my view, not as straightforward as you might think. When I first read that BLTV costs only 500 yen (3,25 USD or, for me, €3,10), I thought this was a total steal. But finding out that these matches last barely any time at all, I've had to reconsider.

Now, if you simply want to spend a lot of time watching the daily life of underage boys, you should a. seek therapy and b. sign up to BLTV immediately, since it's an absolute steal. But for anyone who's mainly/exclusively interested in the actual matches, here's what you need to consider.

What you're getting with a BLTV subscription is ten matches with an average duration (based on the 4 we've seen and assuming PXG doesn't last much longer) of \~10 minute each, with one or two matches every 10 days. If you're approaching this smartly, you don't subscribe at all until the first matches starts, since the first ten days of the NEL are a complete waste of money.

So starting from the day featuring the BM - Barcha and PXG - Ubers matches, the NEL takes place over the span of 45 days (5 match days, 40 days of training in between). This means that you will need to pay for two months of BLTV (1000 yen) if you want to get the full NEL, and that you are getting \~50 minutes of content per month (\~60 in month 1, \~40 in month 2). Now, to do some comparisons, I want to convert the fee of BLTV to a price per hour: so if we are talking $3.25 for 50 minutes of content, you're essentially paying $4,06 per hour.

A priori, I'd say that's still quite a fair price - definitely cheaper than going to most concerts, the cinema, and most likely also than going out for coffee (at least, where I'm living). But since I'm naturally curious, I want to see how this stacks up compared to more direct comparisons: other streaming services.

According to [Netflix' most recent quarterly earning report](https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q3/FINAL-Q3-24-Shareholder-Lettter.pdf), the average subscribers watches two hours of Netflix per day (this is shockingly high imo, but that's what them stats say). A standard Netflix subscription (no ads) currently costs $15.49 per month. So if you're watching two hours of Netflix per day during a 30-day month, you are effectively paying $0.26 per hour (amazing value for money there!). So from that perspective, assuming you are watching the full NEL, you are effectively handing over 15.6 times more than for your single monthly hour of BLTV than the average Netflix user is paying for their media consumption. No wonder that Buratatsu is so happy with how BLTV is doing!",2,1734183891.0,BlueLock,2,1.0,False

Now came this year, he got closer to some of his teammates, and their usual bond is playing a 5v5 mobile game. At first, I was very glad that he finally found his people.
However, as time goes by, I feel like my husband is getting a bit addicted to the game and his new-found friends.

I am an advocate of communication in a relationship. I believe that this will help resolve those hidden toxic things and could be a good way to know the other one's pov. So, after our short family trip in a nearby city, I told him that we are not having lunch together for a month now. And, I feel alone sometimes, especially since my friends are expecting me to have lunch with my husband, so they always go first. I eat alone, and when I get back to the office, I saw my husband laughing and playing with his friends. We usually eat breakfast together, but sometimes, I also eat alone as he is having coffee with those same friends. At home, we usually do not eat together as we do it in an alternate way since we need someone to look for our toddler while he is asleep in our room. And he also still keeps playing the same game, while I bake (i sell cookies at work for additional income).

Some of my work friends noticed this, and they always update me that my husband is always together with this woman who is one of his new friends and playmates. At first, I shove the idea of him having an affair, but I cannot help it since he already did it before, and I already have this fear inside me that he might do it again. I don't know why, but that fear gradually resurfaced every single day that i see my husband playing that game with those friends of his (inckuding the girl). Also, every time he talks about that girl, that she also bakes and how talkative she is. They also usually eat out (their friend group), and leaves me behind. Whereas when me and my friends plan to eat out, I will always never forget to ask him if he wants to join. I also always go to his office to ask if he wants to eat lunch, but I stopped doing that ever since he consistenly rejected my invites.
So after bringing all this up to him, he argued about me not being happy that he finally found friends, and that I am suffocating him. I also argued and this led to him saying that he would rather just d*e than be in this toxic relationship for long.

I was baffled. We barely fight. I do not control him at all with his decisions and actions, just a request that we have lunch together at work. I never manipulated nor gaslighted him. Am I really toxic for bringing up such a simple request? Or he is just being too dramatic about it (which could be a sign that he has someone he likes)? He even told me that I do not even appreciate those good things that he did for me (he helped me selling my goods to his workmates, helping me with my finances as we are still doing it 50/50, took care of me when i got hospitalized). Please help.

tl;dr i asked my husband to have lunch with me at work, instead of playing mobile games with friends, but he tells me i am suffocating him.",2,1734183188.0,marriageadvice,0,1.0,False

Wow. What a difference.

Series one had a smaller cast. Psychologists instead of “experts”. Counselling sessions instead of performative commitment ceremonies. Bad people being called out for their nonsense by the counsellors. Cocktail nights where they could mingle freely instead of dinner parties where they’re stuck around a table answering questions designed to cause conflict at the party. It was a great palate cleanser after this year’s UK competition to see who can be the biggest Instagram arsehole.

We binged it in a week, then on to series two. I can only imagine that this was the year that the AUS format blew up & set the template for the other countries shows, because it was totally different to what we watched the previous week. A cast filled with “characters” who seemingly had no interest in creating a relationship (which of course remains the alleged “point” of the show). Dinner parties are in, complete with the loaded questions. Commitment ceremonies are in, & true to form do nothing to address obnoxious behaviour. Worst of all, though, here is the dramatic music & “click baity” editing to make it seem like a person is going to do / say something, but after the ad break they do the opposite. This wouldn’t be too bad, if they didn’t do it before every damn break for the most banal things e.g. “Do you want a coffee?” Dramatic music, zoom in on second person looking pensive, break, return from break, same scene plays again, second person says “Yes please.” Dramatic music eases into something more calm & the scene moves on.

We’re quite late to MAFS, having started to watch after AUS & UK had already hit their trashy heights, so we never saw the other shows in their early “serious” years. As fun as the format can now be, we can’t help but feel a little disappointed at how things have progressed. Oh well, lol",5,1734183082.0,MAFS_UK,0,1.0,False

I once saw a video that someone asked an imam about this or something, and his advice was to pour boiling water down the drain first to deal with them. The idea is that djinns could potentially gain control over our lives if we don’t take steps to protect ourselves, and this was the suggested remedy.

Since hearing this, I’ve developed a morning routine. When I boil water for coffee, I pour any leftover boiling water down the drain. However, I first let cold tap water run for a bit so the ""djinns"" don’t get burned and die – it’s more like giving them a lukewarm shower. Strange as it may sound, it’s a habit now.

Does anyone heard of something similar? Would love to know if there’s more to this story!",4,1734182975.0,exmuslim,3,0.83,False

Is there a way to use GLASS water reservoir to avoid microplastics contamination?,"I know the plastics are certified to be BPA and BPS free, but I do not buy it - I've read reviews in the past that these certifications are bought, and the manufacturers just use a different polymer (sort of like selling HHC instead of THC in Europe).

  
For that reason I have been going glass only for a few years, I do not want microplastics in my prefrontal cortex and forget who I am when I am 80. 

  
**Is there a way to use porcelain or glass container? Is there some hacker who achieved this?**

At work I use glass chemex, at home I sometimes use V60 or glass aeropress. No issue there. But I want to have automated plastic-free coffee maker. Even the Ratio Eight which used to have glass water reservoir now uses plastic.

Fast forward to last year when he sent me a follow request on ig and we had a little Chat about college n after that we didn't talk much.
But this year I posted my birthday picture n to my surprise he slid into my DM and we again started talking on random topics and after some days he invited me over for coffee ( me being the dumb person didn't understood what it meant) but I refused to go twice or thrice. After rejecting his offer these many times I thought it's very rude of me so I went the next time he asked me.

I came back and he texted me again inviting to his place after refusing for 2 times I went there and we started watching some shows and slowly he came very close to me n kept his head on my shoulder and suddenly started kissing my neck ( me being very sensitive started feeling ticklish) he stopped it and he went for a kiss and I out of nowhere turned my face sideways (even though I was dying to kiss him but my reflex just doesn't let me ) 
He asked me are you getting awkward n all I said we're going to fast so he stopped. Everything was fine and we started texting on WhatsApp and he said me I've got nice curves and noticed it when I held you!! Wanna watch your body and hold it ( this gave me an ick ) I felt like I was objectified.

- **Consultation:** Consider speaking with a dentist to evaluate your oral health and suitability for whitening.
- **Selection of Method:** Choose between professional treatments at a dental office or over-the-counter products for home use.
- **Application:** Follow the specific instructions depending on the method chosen, whether it's trays, strips, or in-office treatments.

- **Dental History:** If you have cavities, gum disease, or sensitive teeth, consult your dentist before proceeding.
- **Initial Tooth Shade:** The natural color of your teeth plays a role in how white they can become. Some individuals may see dramatic changes, while others may have subtler results.
- **Whitening Method:** Different techniques yield different outcomes. In-office treatments typically provide more significant results faster compared to at-home solutions.

### Teeth Whitening After: The Results

The results from teeth whitening can be incredible, turning dull, stained teeth into a bright, sparkling smile. After treatment, you can expect the following:

- **Potential Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience tooth sensitivity or mild gum irritation after treatment. This typically subsides within a few days.
- **Longevity of Results:** The effects can last for months or longer, especially with good oral hygiene and avoiding certain staining foods and drinks.

- **Touch-up Treatments:** You might want to consider periodic touch-ups, especially if you notice any dullness.

### Final Thoughts on Transformation

The journey of teeth whitening before and after is a transformative experience. Watching your smile brighten can bring joy and optimism to your day-to-day life. However, individual results can vary greatly. Therefore, it's essential to choose the right method for your needs and expectations.

Safe Teeth Whitening Methods for Stunning Results
-------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a brighter smile? If so, you're not alone. Many people seek out methods for teeth whitening that can enhance their appearance and boost their confidence.

### Understanding Teeth Discoloration

Before diving into whitening methods, it’s essential to understand why teeth become discolored. Factors that contribute to discoloration include:

- Foods and beverages (like coffee, tea, red wine, and berries)
- Tobacco use
- Age (natural wear can lead to yellowing)
- Poor dental hygiene
- Fluorosis (excess fluoride during childhood)

Recognizing these causes can help you in selecting the right whitening technique.

### Professional Teeth Whitening Treatments

One of the safest and most effective ways to achieve a stunning smile is through professional teeth whitening treatments offered by dentists. Here are a few notable options:

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves applying a whitening gel that can produce noticeable results in just one visit. The effects are immediate, making it ideal for those wanting quick results.
- **Take-Home Kits:** After an initial consultation, your dentist may provide custom-fitted trays and a professional-grade whitening gel. You’ll apply the gel in the trays at home, which ensures a comfortable and effective treatment.

Professional whitening is particularly recommended for those with sensitive teeth as dentists can customize treatments to minimize discomfort.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Over-the-Counter Whitening Products

If you prefer to whiten your teeth at home, there are several over-the-counter (OTC) products that can safely brighten your smile. Some of these products include:

- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Contains mild abrasives and chemical agents to help remove surface stains. It’s a great option for maintaining your new smile after treatment.
- **Whitening Strips:** These adhesive strips contain a bleaching agent and can be applied directly to the teeth. They are easy to use and typically offer noticeable results within a few applications.
- **Whitening Gels and Pens:** Similar to strips, these products allow you to apply a gel directly to your teeth but are often in a pen format for ease of use.

OTC methods are convenient and more economical, but results can vary significantly based on the product and duration of use.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Natural Teeth Whitening Methods

For those who prefer a more organic approach, there are natural remedies that can contribute to a brighter smile. Here are some popular options:

- **Baking Soda:** Known for its mild abrasive properties, baking soda can help scrub away surface stains. Create a paste with water and brush your teeth gently.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This natural bleaching agent can be used as a mouthwash. Dilute it with water (to about 3%) and swish it in your mouth for a few minutes before rinsing.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Although still a topic of debate, some find that brushing with activated charcoal could help absorb surface stains. Use it sparingly to avoid enamel wear.

While natural methods may not always provide the same results as professional treatments, they can be a safe alternative and often contribute to overall dental hygiene.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Precautions and Tips

Regardless of the method you choose, keeping a few important tips in mind can optimize your results:

- Always consult with your dentist before starting any teeth whitening regimen, especially if you have sensitive teeth or existing dental issues.
- Follow product instructions carefully to avoid overuse, which can lead to tooth sensitivity or damage.
- Maintain good oral hygiene with regular brushing and flossing to prolong your whitening results.
- Consider dietary adjustments to reduce staining foods and beverages.

Whitening your teeth can be a rewarding experience. With the right methods and precautions, you can achieve stunning results and enjoy a bright, confident smile that lasts.

You might be surprised to see just how much brighter and more vibrant your smile can become! However, achieving that stunning result doesn’t happen overnight.

1he2rjf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohackers/comments/1he2rjf/the_impact_of_coffee_consumption_on_osteoarthritis/,The impact of coffee consumption on osteoarthritis,"**Background:** Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent degenerative joint condition, and emerging evidence suggests that dietary factors, such as coffee consumption, may influence its risk. However, the relationship between coffee consumption and the risk of developing OA remains ambiguous. This study aims to explore the association between coffee intake and OA complemented by Mendelian randomization (MR) to infer causality.

**Materials and methods:** We analyzed data from 32,439 participants across 10 NHANES cycles (1999–2018), including 3,676 individuals diagnosed with OA. Osteoarthritis was diagnosed through a structured questionnaire, while coffee consumption was assessed via 24-h dietary recalls. Participants were categorized based on reported coffee intake: 0 cups, <2 cups, 2–4 cups, and >4 cups per day. We employed weighted multivariable logistic regression to examine associations between coffee consumption and OA by using data from the NHANES 1999–2018, adjusting for various covariates. Subsequently, a MR analysis was conducted using genetic variants as instrumental variables to infer causal relationships, with multiple methods including inverse-variance weighted (IVW) analysis, MR-Egger regression, and weighted median techniques to assess the robustness, heterogeneity, and potential pleiotropy of our findings.

**Results:** Our regression models indicated an increased risk of OA with rising coffee consumption, with significant associations noted particularly for those consuming more than 4 cups daily (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.00–1.41, *p* = 0.049). In MR analysis, coffee intake was causally linked to OA types, demonstrating increased risk for knee OA (KOA: OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.08–2.35, *p* = 0.018), hip OA (HOA: OR = 1.85, 95% CI: 1.06–3.25, *p* = 0.031), and combined KOA and HOA (KHOA: OR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.18–2.33, *p* = 0.003). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the stability of results across multiple evaluation methods.

**Conclusion:** Our findings highlight a significant association between coffee consumption and an increased risk of OA, suggesting that higher intake levels may contribute to OA morbidity. These results warrant further exploration into the underlying biological mechanisms and implications for dietary guidelines in populations at risk for OA.

We had a quick chat, and I mentioned he should join us for the Thanksgiving celebration of the program we’re both a part of. I said I’d text him to remind him, and I did. He ended up coming, and after that, we started texting a lot. We’ve been sharing music, creating a Spotify Blend, and he keeps sending me songs saying, “I think you’d like this one,” like Hold On by The Internet and YSL by June Freedom. Which are like very ""romantic"" songs.

We also started talking about books. He mentioned he had one, and without me even showing interest, he just said, “I can lend it to you.” I said, “Sure,” and he asked if Monday worked. I told him I was out of town but could do another day. We ended up scheduling to meet on Wednesday.  

We’ve been texting late at night too. He hasn’t flirted much, but he once said, “I like how contact lenses look on you,” which felt like an awkward compliment. He’s also said things like my style suits me or that it’s fitting for me to be a teacher. I’ve complimented him back in a similar way, indirectly.  

On Wednesday at 7 PM, we met up. Before that, he texted me, saying he was embarrassed because he couldn’t find the book. I told him it was fine and asked if we were still on for coffee, and he said yes. When we met, he immediately took me to a cute café, and we stayed until 9:30 PM, mostly talking about high school, college, and random stories. There was no awkward silence, and the conversation flowed easily.  

I’m Macedonian, and he’s Albanian, which isn’t super common in North Macedonia, especially for dating. But it felt natural. I work with Albanians but don’t speak the language, while he speaks perfect Macedonian, and we both know English.  

At the end of the night, he said, “Should we get going?” I agreed but mentioned I wanted to go to the restroom. While I was gone, he paid the bill (just an espresso and a tea). When I came back, someone else was in the restroom, so I said, “I don’t want to keep you waiting; we can go.” As we were putting on our jackets, he pointed out the restroom was free again, but I said I already had my jacket on. I’m not sure if he thought I made up the restroom thing so he’d pay, but I did offer to pay him back, and he wouldn’t accept. I feel very stupid about how that situation played out.

While walking out, I joked that it was “very Albanian” of him not to let me pay. He said it’s a common thing, and I mentioned how my Albanian coworker does the same. I’m curious if he paid as a gentleman on a date or just because it’s a cultural thing.  

After that, we walked to a bus stop. I asked if he was waiting for a bus, and he said, “I’m waiting for you.” I told him I usually walk home, and he said he’d walk too but in the opposite direction. We hugged lightly and went our separate ways.  

I texted him, thanking him for the tea and the company, and he replied by asking if I got home safely. We ended up texting until 2 AM, but I sent the last message saying I was going to bed. He replied the next day and now we just text without ever really ending the conversation, se just reply whenever sometimes that's like after 12 hours sometimes like 2 minutes.

I don’t know what to think. We text back and forth without really ending the conversation or saying good night. He did mention once, “Next time we see each other,” to remind me to show him the fortune cookie fortunes I keep in my phone case. The conversation hasnt been that active but we also don't  have a dynamic to ask what are you up to, how are you or what's up we just text actually conversation deep in topics and stuff.

What should I do?

I definitely find him attractive, and would have wanted to think the outing was a date I am just so confused. We are friends but had never gone out alone before this or texted as actively, we would just talk about random things mostly connected to the program we are a part of and some small talk.",1,1734181940.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Tried them with Demerara rum and thought it would work well with coffee, so I'm exploring this riff at the moment:

* 1oz/3cl Amaro (preferably Nonino)
* 0.75oz/2.2cl aged Demerara rum (El Dorado 12)
* 0.75oz/2.2cl aged Jamaican rum (Appleton 12)
* 0.25oz/0.75cl sweet coffee liqueur (Kahlua, if using drier liqueur like Mr Black potentially add a barspoon of Demerara rich syrup)
* 2 dashes Angostura bitters
* 2 dashes orange bitters

Combine, stir, strain over ice or serve up (still exploring both options) in a chilled glass, flame an orange zest on top. 

Most cocktails I love are boozy and this one is too. I found it fairly sweet, but its rich flavours make it work well as a winter cocktail. The orange adds a bit of contrast, but maybe not enough. I think the mix of rum and amaro would not appeal to most people but I find it interesting.

Next steps:

* Sugar: Still need to play with various combinations of syrups and liqueurs. Maybe switching the Nonino for Montenegro and upping the demerara syrup could be interesting.
* Rum: The Demerara feels essential for the toffee flavours, but the other rum could be funkier than the Appleton 12, or going the other way around with a Blackstrap.
* Citrus: Potential to brighten further, maybe a lime wheel (dehydrated or not). Could even try a little orange liqueur.
* Garnish: Could lean more into the winter theme with grated nutmeg or cocoa powder, but I'm wary of ending up with muddied flavours.

Typically, I host a happy hour with the BE crew.  Let me know if you'll be attending the AEA I will put together an event.  I am also happy to meet up with job market candidates for coffee in commiseration or advice during the event.  Mainly looking forward to reconnecting with old friends and colleagues and attending sessions on AI.

- Grinding my beans from medium to course, where I even found a whole bean in it. 

- Getting my coffee ground and a coffee shop.

- Running that coffee through a sieve to remove any fines.

- Using around 40g of the sifted coffee for 1L of water.

- Changing between 4 different filter papers. Folding it properly away from the drain.

- Using filtered water.

I have ran empty pots and it seems to flow fine, so it must be the coffee, but I feel like I have tried everything to change the coffee.

1he2he6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1he2he6/new_aeropress_user_trying_to_understand_the/,New aeropress user trying to understand the results.,"Hi guys, so I'm a relatively new aeropress user, got it on black Friday. I'm just a bit confused by the results I'm getting with this brewer, and am looking for some help.

So for some info, I'm using a single origin light roast naturally processed Costa-Rican coffee, and my grinder is a Timemore C2 (grind setting 12). I've been following James Hoffmann's aeropress recipe for a reference brew, 11 grams of beans, 100C water + 2 minute steep, swirl, wait 30s and press gently until everything is through. For some reason the cup tastes... bitter? I don't know if this is truly bitter but it has an unpleasant astringency to it. Tried grinding finer and courser but it just didn't really taste very pleasant.

So fast forward to today, I got inspired by the steep & release methods of brewing and I had an idea: same brewing recipe as James's, but instead of pressing, after the 2 minute steep and swirl, I just pop out the plunger and let it drain on it's own. This took... Very long, like 6 minutes to drain. However the results were very interesting. The cup tastes very different. Clean, almost none of the astringency I had before, juicy, the acidity was very forward in a pleasant way and made my mouth water, bitterness was also much more muted. Overall it just felt much more enjoyable to drink.

So I'm having a hard time trying to understand what's going on here. If a coffee tastes bitter I assume it had to be over extracted or too fine of a grind. But with my experiment today the contact time with water is way longer, so this theoretically should mean more extraction, but idk why it just tasted noticibly less bitter and much more balanced. Can some one please help me figure out what's going on? Should I try grinding much finer and give it a shot using the Hoff's recipe again? 

Would really appreciate any explanation. Thanks!",6,1734181621.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

The police found her car parked on the side of I 70, abandoned. She was dead, most people missing past 48 hours don’t make it. 

“We found her this morning in a wooded area, the dental records were a match.”

“Yeah, it’s her, how did -”

“The autopsy hasn’t been preformed yet, but they’re assuming it was blunt force trauma. There’s an open investigation on details I can discuss.”

The phone went silent and I nodded, in a daze. Feeling sick to my stomach, I and told the officer I had to leave, hanging up the phone. Walking  into my living room I grabbed a pillow, crying until my throat hurt and my eyes swollen. 

*Come on, you have to pull yourself together.* I blew my nose and hiccupped. The silence was peirced by a phone call. 

“This is Detective Thompson. I know this is a difficult time for you, but can you come into the station for questioning?”

“S..sure.” All the tears had left my voice, at this point everything was cold and numb, like wading through static. 

“Will three-thirty work for you?”

No time was good for me, but what choice did I have? If I refused it would seem suspicious. “Yea, I’ll come down.”

“I’m so sorry this happened, Ms. Kelly, but the more information we have the sooner we can solve this.”

*Or the sooner you can lazily pin this on someone and close the case.* “I understand, you have my full cooperation. I want this solved too.”

“Alright, we’ll see you then.”

The phone went silent. 

She had died horribly, and I was going to find out who did this and make them suffer. Suffer worse than she had. Outside of my house was a pile of firewood. I searched it until I found a plank of oak. I would make a spirit board, but not the cheap Ouija that Parker Brothers shilled out to curious teenagers.

I carefully burned the words into the wooden panel. The smell of scorched cedar stung my lungs and my eyes were sore from crying , it didn’t matter. I found a pattern of the sun and moon and followed each detail until both images were pristine.  I struck my index finger with a sewing needle and the thirsty wood absorb my blood. Choosing a smaller block of wood, I carved a planchette, it was nothing more than a simple pointer but it would work. Finally, I placed a photo of Lily at the top. By the time my work was completed my hands were sore and the sun was breaking out over the sky. 

Concentrating I asked what the board wanted. I was so exhausted the planchette floated to the letters with no fanfare.

*G O T O SLEEP.*

“Lily, is that you?”

*YES.*

“How can I help?”

*D R E A M*

 The air suddenly grew cold and I wrapped a blanket around me. I wanted to sink into the couch, into the floor and into the cold damp earth, never to wake again.

I woke to the weight of cold chains around my ankles,  pleading with the man to let me go. The smell of exhaust at the engine started and the searing pain at my body dragged against the road. 

I woke to my heart pounding and my couch drenched in sweat. It was dark out, the clock silently ticking. My phone read that it was close to three am, the witching hour. There were five missed calls from the local police department. 

I made some coffee and drank it black, enjoying it’s warmth and bitterness. My phone vibrated against me and answered. The tired officer on the other line, I told him that I passed out and I was sorry and agreed to meet him in the afternoon for questioning. 

I reviewed my handiwork from the night before. A plain cedar board with ornate wooden letters carved into it. The sun and moon looked ornate, the yes and no were slightly off center but that didn’t matter. I took some silver and gold paint and filled in the sun and moon before slapping a clear code of lacquer over the board. Parker Brother’s eat your heart out.

I got into my small silver car and left toward the police station. Entering the office to a tired looking officer with thinning hair. 

“Candace Williams, I’m here to discuss the Lily Henderson case.”

The officer’s eyes dropped. “Ma’am, I’m sorry for your loss. I’m detective Thompson. please come on back to the office.”

The office was surprisingly cozy. A simple desk with a computer sat next to a few office chairs. I took a seat in one as the Detective sat across from me.

“Ms. Williams, can I get you anything, a coffee or donut perhaps?” He smiled warmly.

“Coffee, if that’s ok.”

“Sure thing.” He left the room and came back with a small paper cup. “It ain’t Starbucks but it’ll get the job done. I am so sorry for your loss. Any information that you have about Lilly that will help us solve this case is would be greatly appreciated.”

“Do you know what happened to her?” A tear fell from my eye.

“It’s still under investigation. We're working to resolve this for you and her family.” He lowered his head. “Do you remember the last time you saw her?”

I racked my brain trying to remember when I last saw her. “It was three weeks ago. We were going to meet up and she never showed. I called her phone she never answered, I thought she was busy.  I should have checked in on her and have been a better friend.” My chest tightened as tears clouded over my eyes.

“Candace, none of this is your fault.” His tone calmed my frazzled nerves. “I have a daughter and I’m terrified of what could happen to her. Ma’am I’m going to do everything I can to get this monster off the street, but you’ve got to help me. Do she mention anyone following her? Any stalkers, or any jealous ex boyfriends?”

“Lily did mention her ex, his name was James Martin, I think. They had a major falling out and she stayed at my house for a few weeks, he had been harassing her online but I never thought it would come to this.”

“Do you know his address? What kind of vehicle he drove? Anything you can remember.”

“A Toyota Tacoma, black. I don’t remember a plate number…” A flashback of the vision interuppted my thoughts, the black truck, the chains, the screaming. “663YET, I think, I’m not a hundered percent sure on it.” 

“It’s ok, anything you can remember, you’re a great help. Do you want some water? You look a little bit peeked.”

“I’ll take some more coffee if you have it.”

“You’re going to be up all night.”

His warm nature made me smile in spite of myself as he refilled my cup of coffee and handed me a glazed donut, my stomach growled as I realized I forgot to eat since afternoon yesterday.

“Thank you, and it’s ok, I work night shift.”

“Understood. do you remember anything else about James?”

“He’s a big guy, reddish brown hair. He had a beard the last time I saw him. Lily would stay at my place to avoid him. He used to work at Wells Fargo with us, before they had layoffs.”

“Was he ever threatening towards you?”

“Not to my face, he didn’t like her hanging out with me. That's really all I have right now”

“Ok. Are you ok to drive home?” His eyes had a fatherly concern.

“I’ll be ok, if it makes you feel better I can text you when I get home.”

“I’d hate to impose-”

“It’s no problem.” Nodding,  I gathered my purse and left the station. I went home scrolled on my phone to James's socials. They were full of the same misogynistic speeches, hunting pictures and the confederate flag. But the photo of his truck and plate were in plain view.

At sunset I placed the spirit board on the middle of my alter and lit a black and red candle. Holding the planchette in my hands, I called Lily's name. It trembled as hit floated to Hello.

“Lily, is this you?” I asked, my heart beating rapidly.

*YES*.

“Was James the one that killed you?”

*YES.*

My rage surged. “We got him. I gave the police his plate number, he’s going to go away for a long time.”

 *N O T G O O D E N O U G H.*

*“*Not enough? I’m doing all that I can, what more do you want?”

*D E A T H P A I N H E L L.*

*“*I hope he gets the death penalty. He needs to suffer.”

The planchette jumped in my hands once again.

*Y O U C U R S E H I M*

I was a practicing Witch, but I didn’t curse people, then again, I didn’t need to curse anyone up until now. The murder of my best friend seemed a justified reason enough to.

My kitchen started to shake and cabinet drawers opened and slammed shut. the air grew so cold I could see my breath in front of me. And at my feet there was my phone and a mason jar. Shaking I picked them both up. I wasn’t practiced in curses, but this was a place to start. 

Lighting some black candles and dragons blood incense,  my bedroom was filled with a soft glow and the scent of resin, wax and roses. I wrote the name James Martin Will Suffer on a sticky note, then I crossed out the vowels and repeating letters. Taking the remaining letters I  rearranged them into a cryptic glyf. Folding up the sigil, spat on it in the Mason jar and covered it with dirt before sealing the lid.

I drove to a near by river. In the past I had volunteered and cleaned litter from its shores, I collected rocks from her banks.

“River spirit, I need your help. Take this jar and run it’s namesake to the bottom. May your water fill his breath and may my sister have her vengeance, by the name of Hecate and Morrigan”   The river carried it before bashing it into a boulder, breaking the jar into sharp shards before whisking it downstream. I prayed that the bastard would meet his end.

 Lily would pound on my walls every night and move my furniture. I went back to the spirit board asking if there was anything she wanted but it was the same message every time.

The grief and lack of sleep were affecting my job, my boss told me to take some leave and provided me the number to a grief counselor. When I was younger I used to bury myself in work to avoid pain, but now it only left me exhausted. I felt brittle as though my whole world was breaking around me. 

I would give my testimony and along with the evidence, James would be sentenced to death. My job was done, the curse was only an accelerant for the inevitable. Except the trial would never come. I went back to the police office and asked for Officer Thompson.

“Ms. Williams?” said the detective. “Are you all right, you seem tired.”

“I am, have you heard anything from James Martin?”

Thompson looked back and fourth. “I think you should come into my office, I’ll get you some coffee.”

“Thank you,” I said, as he lead me back to a small stuffy room shaded by blinds.

“I’m technically not supposed to discuss this with civilians, but I know you were her friend. James volunteered his vehicle, the tire tracks don’t match and he has a fairly solid alibi. He was helping some family move some equipment.”

“With his truck.”

“Yes, his truck was out, that’s why we don’t have a lead. Did Lilly have anyone else? Like any one that was giving her the creeps, maybe on social media?”

“No. Her and James were constantly fighting, she never told me about anyone else. I’m sorry. “

“Ma’am, I promise you we’ll do everything we can. We’re talking to her family, we’ll let you know if anything changes if you do the same.”

I felt completely numb as I got into my car, as though I were on another plane of existence, slowly fading away. Rage welled up inside me. But not at the kindly old officer, he was just doing the best he could. James planned this out, and dragged an innocent woman to death where no one could hear her scream. I needed to find proof.

My phone vibrated with a text from an unregistered number.  

:I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.  THEY WON'T FIND YOUR BODY:

My heart froze in my chest as I looked for the number, but the message had disappeared.  Fear burned into rage, the bastard wouldn't get away with this.

I visited James's once for a New Years Eve party, before he forbade Lily from talking to me. He lived on a farm with his parents but in a separate house.  I parked my car in a field at the far end of his property and passed through a wooded area with a sharp ravine. Clambering down the steep path I crossed a wooden bridge over the river, the babble of the water over the stones calmed my jumpy nerves. Climbing up the steep slope I followed the path out of the woods. The estate loomed in the distance. 

Rather than taking the dirt road I walked through the pasture. A few sleepy cows walked passed me, unbothered by my presents. Reaching the estate, I  made my way to the enormous garage. The door was locked tight. 

The wind blew heavily against the garage, so heavy I had to brace myself. I ducked behind the structure as James walked out the door. Cursing under his breath he opened the door to the garage. In the corner loomed a stack of tires lying next to a chain. The image of Lily being dragged down the dirt road flashed through my mind and her screams made my flesh break out in a cold sweat.  A ringing cell phone broke the silence.

“Hello?” said James over the phone.

James's face fell, his skin paled as he ran back into the house. I took out my phone and snapped a photo of the evidence just as James  screamed as I took off running as fast as my legs would carry me. My lungs burned from the cold air as he was gained on me. My legs buckled under me as I made my way through the woods towards the ravine, the river churning beneath me. Turning around to face him, his eyes wide with surprise.

“Why are you trespassing on my property, Candy?”

The words caught in my throat, I was too scared to say anything as he inched towards me.

“Now, you’re going to be a good girl and give me you’re phone.”

“Or what? Why do you want my phone. If you have an alibi you have nothing to worry about.”

His eyes went blank. “What I did to Lily will be nothing compared to what I’ll do to you.”

*Death, pain, hell.* The words flashed through my mind. I listened to the river beneath me. James lunged towards me but I caught him off balance. He fell sharply down the ravine, landing on a large rock in the river. His bones poking through his shattered leg as he screamed in pain.

“Help!” 

Smiling,  I looked into his pleading eyes before pushing him into the current, not enough to sweep him away but enough to drag the broken limb. His screams were exquisite as buzzards began to circle overhead.

The drive home was peaceful, and I felt heavy and drowsy.  For the last time I rested my hands on the planchette as it drifted towards goodbye.

I visited James's once for a New Years Eve party, before he forbade Lily from talking to me. He lived on a farm with his parents but in a seperate house.  I parked my car in a field at the far end of his property and passed through a wooded area with a sharp ravine. Clambering down the steep path I crossed a wooden bridge over the river, the babble of the water over the stones calmed my jumpy nerves. Climbing up the steep slope I followed the path out of the woods. The estate loomed in the distance. 

Rather than taking the dirt road I walked through the pasture. A few sleepy cows walked passed me, unbothered by my presents. Reaching the estate, I  made my way to the enormous garage. The door was locked tight. 

The wind blew heavily against the garage, so heavy I had to brace myself. I ducked behind the structure as James walked out the door. Cursing under his breath he opened the door to the garage. In the corner loomed a stack of tires lying next to a chain. The image of Lily being dragged down the dirt road flashed through my mind and her screams made my flesh break out in a cold sweat.  A ringing cell phone broke the silence.

“Hello?” said James over the phone.

James's face fell, his skin paled as he ran back into the house. I took out my phone and snapped a photo of the evidence just as James  screamed as I took off running as fast as my legs would carry me. My lungs burned from the cold air as he was gained on me. My legs buckled under me as I made my way through the woods towards the ravine, the river churning beneath me. Turning around to face him, his eyes wide with surprise.

“Why are you trespassing on my property, Candy?”

The words caught in my throat, I was too scared to say anything as he inched towards me.

“Now, you’re going to be a good girl and give me you’re phone.”

“Or what? Why do you want my phone. If you have an alibi you have nothing to worry about.”

His eyes went blank. “What I did to Lily will be nothing compared to what I’ll do to you.”

*Death, pain, hell.* The words flashed through my mind. I listened to the river beneath me. James lunged towards me but I caught him off balance. He fell sharply down the ravine, landing on a large rock in the river. His bones poking through his shattered leg as he screamed in pain.

“Help!” 

Smiling,  I looked into his pleading eyes before pushing him into the current, not enough to sweep him away but enough to drag the broken limb. His screams were exquisite as buzzards began to circle overhead.

The drive home was peaceful, and I felt heavy and drowsy.  For the last time I rested my hands on the planchette as it drifted towards goodbye.

This is a ramble I'm still extremely out of it.

For context, I am a former addict. I was addicted to a variety of substances for years until I confessed to my boyfriend about a month into our relationship. He had introduced me to his friends and a girl who was there had a substance that was formerly my choice (I won't disclose it so l can at least have some form of privacy to not identify me, just in case). I felt guilty about hiding it from him because to me, he was perfect. I knew he deserved a girlfriend who could be good enough for him and wasn't into all those terrible habits and if I came clean I’d have to stick to sobriety. He blamed himself a lot for introducing me to her. I told him it wasn't his fault and l've had a problem with this for years but he still took the blame and felt like he had wronged me.
Ever since that moment in January I had never touched a single substance (California sober wise haha).

Lately I've been on a downward spiral, fighting temptations to go back to hold habits and falling into a depression. I told him about the thoughts l've been having 3 days ago, and he told me I could always go to him when I have these thoughts because we were in this together and he is my partner.

Today was a terribly rough day for me and I had plans with him today that I was very excited for.
About 30 minutes before I got off work he sent me a text telling me he was going to see his friend for a little. Well a little turned into all night, and I was hurt. I sent him a huge text about how selfish and inconsiderate he was and his response was not what I was expecting. To sum it up, he pretty much gave a thorough apology but also basically called me hypocrite in so many words because I have cancelled plans last minute before and he doesn't get as upset about it. I didn't even know how to respond so I just said okay, drove to his house while he was gone and dropped off everything I got him and his family for Christmas, and the engagement ring.

In my efforts to try and make the most of my night, I decided to drink alone in my room and enjoy my own drunken company. I tried to just get some beer from the shady gas station that typically doesn't ID but tonight I had no luck. I decided to call my older friend and asked her if we could go to a liquor store and get me a good old bottle. When I dropped her back off at her house, I saw her boyfriend was a ""pharmacist"" and had something that used to be my favorite. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't resist it. I bought a little just to see how I felt and took it home. I thought since I had already ruined my relationship with the most wonderful man I had ever met, why not ruin everything else? That mindset sounds insane, I know. I think those who struggle with the same issues I do would understand though. 

After I got home and indulged in my guiltiest craving, I realized I had made a grave mistake. I had ruined my sobriety and his trust as I told him when I originally confessed to my habits I would never go back to the life I had. I realized It wasn't worth it at all. All I could think about is how miserable this one stupid decision had made me.

I told some of my close friends that had always supported me through my addiction and I got mixed responses about whether or not I should tell my him about what I did. One friend told me it was something I did and it doesn't have to involve him, but I feel like it involves him in every way. He loves me enough to ask me to be his wife, he's going to be my partner, my equal, everything I do makes an impact on him.

I know I need to tell him, but I don't want him to feel like it was his fault. I know my rambling about our argument made it seem like I made the choice I did because of a little fight, but it was entirely on me.
What could I do to make it easier on him and make him feel like it has nothing to do with him and everything to do with me?

About an hour into my chaos I realized how much I overreacted over our argument and felt even more horrible. He was right about everything he said to me, I am a hypocrite and I obviously don't keep promises. If I can't be perfect I shouldn't expect him to be. I texted him apologizing for everything and he did the same, even though he had nothing to apologize for, because that’s just the man he is. Everything was okay between us again, until he got home and saw the ring on his coffee table. He texted me asking me if I left it there, and I profusely apologized and told him I knew it was a mistake as soon as I drove off. He swore it was okay and he understood but I know it hurt him deeply. I told him that we had to talk about something serious tomorrow, which is now today, and I am terrified. I already hurt him by giving him back the ring, how could I possibly tell him what l've done and hurt him even more. Obviously, I know I need to tell him the truth, but how do I do it in a way that won't destroy his life and our future?

Before you judge me, I know I'm wrong and he deserves more than this. I told him all about me and the problems I have and he told me he was going to stay by me and we will work through everything together, and I guess I am just selfish enough to let him. 

Feel free to do more than just answer the question I asked, criticize me, tell me what to do better, tell me how to fix myself. I love him, and I know he is the one I need and want to spend the rest of my life with. I also understand I cannot continue our relationship if I keep hurting him like this, but I can't let go.

TLDR: I relapsed and I don’t know how to tell my fiancé without hurting him/him taking the blame ",0,1734181522.0,relationship_advice,14,0.33,False
1he2fod,https://www.reddit.com/r/NightEatingSyndrome/comments/1he2fod/again_nes_kicked_to_the_curb/,Again: NES kicked to the curb,"I posted here before as I found a sure way not to want to eat during night even if I wake up or sleep poorly for other reasons. 

The culprit of NES in my case is anxiety. Trying to soothe it I medicate with food. I do not eat that much, I hardly ever eat processed foods, I eat minimal sugar and I do not eat grains and flour. Still, there are nuts and cheese - which I use as drugs to medicate myself after work.

Whenever I eat anything after 4-5pm, I will be eating  later in the evening and then at night. This is hormonal, I am sure. 

In September I was challenged to travel to Russia to see my old mother and as expected this trip messed me up big time. I was highly stressed all the time, could not sleep, could not eat. When I came back to US, I immediately started working and although situation here is so much better, I was totally depleted and it took me two months to get through recovery process. Even knowing what is the best scenario was in terms of eating, I dipped into sugar. Dates. Figs. I was snacking on nuts and cheese after 5pm. I had a constant unhealthy hunger. Potentially because I did not eat for three weeks during my “vacation”. Food deprivation never worked for me. Naturally, NES was back. And for the life of me I could not face my time after 5 without nuts and cheese! 

Yesterday I did it! We had Christmas party at work going for long lunch at the steakhouse. Portions were ridiculously small. lol I ate small piece of meat and lots of lettuce. That was it. I do not drink alcohol. I finished eating around 2:30pm. And I did not eat or snacked after! I came home, I knitted, I read, I relaxed in hot bath. It was hard to go to sleep as one negative person contacted me around 10pm which spiked anxiety. Also, at the restaurant I had a cup of coffee around 2:30-3pm. I normally do not drink caffeinated beverages after 8am. 

Nevertheless although I tossed and turned and tried to stop thinking about the negative person, I did not want to eat! My husband bought dates, nuts, cheese. Everything was available in the kitchen. I was not triggered. 

I woke up today REFRESHED!!! Even though I slept less than usual, and I can’t say my sleep was deep as I have to deal with negative person who is my subordinate whom I recently hired and now regret dearly, I feel SOOOO much better than after sleeping post-snacking.

I wear Apple Watch and follow my HRV patterns, resting heart rate. My heart rate during sleep is around 63bp but today it was 56! It is amazing improvement and my HRV went up a lot even considering tossing and turning and feeling played by my subordinate with whom I can’t work but can’t terminate quite yet either. 

I absolutely will follow my recipe today as well. 

Yes, I know people usually do not like this recipe as it requires tossing away all the crutches. This is not easy. But once done, it is freedom!",2,1734181452.0,NightEatingSyndrome,0,1.0,False

No, it's actually Saturday 14 December…

But let's go back to Thursday 12 December.

My wife is on a ""zero-waste"" group, and much to our delight, again someone is interested in the ever growing heap of small glass Creme Brûlée dishes. Obviously we could just throw them in the glass-recycling bins, but direct use is even more friendly for the environment. Sending them via the ""Pastomatas"" is pretty much out of the question, so I decide that it might be useful to take them, Klaipėda is on my usual hitchhiking route to Klaipėda, and the lady who wants them (or at least 40 of them) doesn't mind picking them up at the petrol station just outside Klaipėda. 

After trying, without much luck, to stack them, I eventually settle for duct tape and create seven layers of six trays, put them in a big paper bag that just about fits in my daypack, set the alarm at 4:20 and go to bed.

And then it's finally Friday 13 December.

Arriving at the spot just after the kebab shop on the A1 outside Vilnius at about 6:20, it takes until 6:39 to get a ride towards Kaunas, and much to my delight, it turns out that the driver is going 60 km further, and I'm dropped off at the exit for the 164. Walking back from the exit sliproad onto the A1, I have to wait 23 minutes for a ride to the petrol station in Kryžkalnis, where I almost immediately walk back onto the emergency lane of the A1, and 12 minutes later I'm rewarded with a ride to my destination. About 20 or so minutes before arrival, I call Laura, but it takes her a bit longer to arrive, having missed the exit I suggested to take, she didn't realise that you need to take the heavy-traffic lane to take it.

After exchanging the trays for two books, I cross the A1, for a change via the bridge just a few hundred metres before the petrol-station, the last time I just ran across (don't try this at home...) and was ""apprehended"" by the police just driving by, and subsequently giving me a free ride to the burger-joint cum self-service petrol-station, the Lithuanian police is pretty hitchhiker friendly.

After a burger with fries and a coffee, I walk back to the A1, and just five minutes later I get my third pickup by the same guy: on 29 February (and an unknown date before, he remembered) he had given me a ride, when I returned from Liepāja with apple pies and flowers for my wife. I'm dropped off at the exit for Vėžaičiai/Veiviržėnai, because, well, hitching in Lithuania directly on the emergency lane, is in general faster than asking around at petrol-stations. I'm rewarded with a five minute wait, a young man driving his father and brother takes me to the petrol-station at the exit for Šilalė. It's empty, so I walk straight back to the A1, and I can still greet the driver with ""Labas rytas"", as only six minutes later, at 11:50 a woman stops, and gives me a ride directly to Vilnius; she's going to visit her daughter for the weekend. We get there at 14:28 a little under eight hours after my departure, not too shabby for a 595 km day with six rides.

As what was in it for me? 13 December was one of my just four ""red"" days, i.e. days where I hitched less than 250 km. It's now green! The next red one is this Monday, so guess where I'll be hanging out at about 6:20. ;)",1,1734181288.0,hitchhiking,0,1.0,False

1he2cjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1he2cjr/mom_playing_victim_for_attention/,Mom playing victim for attention ,"So last night while I was in the washroom, she tripped on the cat while going down the stairs. She yelled at the cat for a fee seconds and i could tell by the way she was saying it that she was totally fine. She was screaming ow! Or crying or calling for help. She just had that exchange with the cat and then kept going to get what she wanted.

But then because her husband and I didn't immediately come running or ask if she was okay she made a huge deal about it. 🙄.

She passive aggressive started yelling that no one asked if she was ok. And said ""thanks everyone for checking on me""! Then she started to go on and on about how her angel was twisted and almost crushed. 

She then yelled at her husband and slept on the couch.

This morning, I went downstairs to get coffee and suddenly she starts limping around, making noises, ugh! Arggg! Gah! Like she's hurting sooooo bad. Funny she wasn't making any of those sounds before I came down stairs. I could hear her walking around. She starts saying how her ankle is messed up and noooobody cares! 


I tried to nip it in the bud, saying I could hear her last night and she sounded fine. That's why I didn't say anything or come out.
Because she was yelling at the cat and then carried on. That she wasn't calling for help or saying anything. So that's why I didn't react. 

Then I took  the dog downstairs  to pee, and she immediately runs to the patio just above us and calls out passive aggressive that we both want her to die( meaning me and her husband). Eye roll.

I went back upstairs to my room, door closed, she starts crying. I turn up my TV, crocodile tears stop.

Now I feel like I can't leave my room. I Just want to enjoy my ONE DAY OFF WORK. And I'm so sick of her behavior. ",2,1734181188.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False

He said she asked for me yesterday and he told her the truth. He said I needed to work on my own recovery and I’ve been in a lot of pain. She said maybe I asked to much from her. At the same time all the things she was asking me, she was asking him. I don’t know how it’s going to play out but I think hubby and I will be okay. That was my biggest concern. 

I spent a lot of yesterday trying to just self reflect. I cried off and on. When I was finally able to dig deep I realized she broke my heart. I’m grieving the lose of my friend. Yes she’s my mother in law but we were really close friends. I trusted her and I feel betrayed. Hubby said he was really worried about me, I said me too , I’m sad and heartbroken. I hadn’t realized that until that moment. I truly think our friendship is over. I’m going to miss the friendship.

1he2byq,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1he2byq/more_hyperactive_with_medication/,More hyperactive with medication?,"Hi there! 

TLDR:
ADHD Dx since 4 months, Elvanse 50mg since 2,5 months. I love having more energy and it’s def helping my inattentive adhd. However, because I have more energy, I feel it’s *increasing* some “classic” hyperactive adhd traits. Does anyone recognise this? Currently without psychiatrist due to circumstances but trying to find a new one asap, lot of waiting lists..


Long story:

I (29 F) was diagnosed 4 months ago. The psychiatrist I was seeing is apparently an expert in adhd dx for 30 years and well respected in his field. However, currently I’m not being followed up for medication, nor adhd. The reason is that the man turned out to be a massive prick, who yelled at me when I had some basic questions about insurance and his pay (I’m an immigrant in this country and not fully aware of the processes). It was a very traumatic incident for me as I felt completely at the mercy of this man; while feeling unsafe, ridiculed and (in danger of getting physically) abused by someone with whom I’d shared my deepest feelings and who was supposed to be a caregiver. It still hurts in my gut while saying this, even though it’s been over 2 months since I last saw the guy.

Anyway, not the point, just some context. 
More context on my meds: tried methylphenidate for a month building up to a dose of 30mg a day with no small positive results and a bunch of nasty side effects. After this month I saw the psych again and before the incident happened (this was the appointment where he yelled at me) I described above about the fake Ritalin and he prescribed 50mg Elvanse lisdexamfetamine. This has been great, very few negative side effects and I can actually feel it working for some 8 hours a day. I’ve been taking it for 2,5 months now with some small breaks here and there.

Now, I am trying to find a new psychiatrist. My GP has agreed to prescribe the Elvanse for me for the foreseeable future, since there are a lot of patient stops and waiting lists. So I’m working on that.
The reason I post this here, apart from a little vent, is to ask to compare what other people are feeling on adhd medication, specifically lisdex, since I can’t discus with a psychiatrist atm. Not looking for medical assistance.

My experience is positive, let me start with that. I have way more energy, and don’t feel like I’ve had 3 nights of no sleep throughout the day anymore. I can focus on a task that I am doing, albeit a bit too much, that I forget my surroundings sometimes. I am more patient, feeling, I can feel and think at the same time without being overwhelmed, I can listen to other people without my brain going in 1000 directions and wanting to interrupt. I feel it’s making me a more pleasant, positive person. I’m better at my job, too.

Other things I notice are a bit less productive though, but still make me feel like ‘me’ again, if that makes sense. I feel like some parts of my adhd are being enhanced instead of ‘numbed’, for lack of better word. On a day off like today, I am doing 4 things at the same time, forgetting (and remembering!) what I’m doing half the time, getting interrupted by needing to do other tasks that I’d forgotten. 

As an example, this morning I was making coffee. I had to refill the jar with new filter coffee and I decided to wash the jar first. Since the new coffee from the package won’t fit in the jar I decided I needed to exchange with a bigger jar I have; this one has some sugar in it, but it doesn’t deserve the large jar. I started washing the now old coffee jar and started the coffee machine at the same time. Then I remembered I had to reply to a message on WhatsApp, so I tell myself, this is more urgent because I will forget the WhatsApp message. I go sit in the living room and reply to that WhatsApp message. I remember I also have to reply to 3 other people very urgently (they texted me days ago) so I do that, and I feel good about it. Then, I remember I had also made breakfast before all of this so I get my breakfast from the kitchen and then I see the coffee jar in water, my coffee ready in the machine. I’ll do it after breakfast, I decide. I go sit at the dinner table and eat my breakfast slowly because I’m not that interested in food with Elvanse. I eat all of it, but in the mean time, I pick out some Christmas decorations that are in a box on the dinner table, to hang later. I sort them by colour and size and get excited thinking about going to the shop later today to get some other decorations. I wanna make sure I can go together with my SO, so I go to the bedroom to wake him, but he’s still fast asleep. I go back to the kitchen to clean my bowl, and see the coffee jar soaking. I need to clean that now. But first I need to clean my porridge cooking pot and bowl and ALL these other dishes! So I do that. Now there’s no space to clean the coffee jar (tiny kitchen). I start to wonder about my adhd and reply to another WhatsApp message by a dear audhd friend who helped me identify my adhd for what it is. I see on my calendar my period is coming up and I look up online Elvanse and menstrual cycle and go down that rabbit hole.
I mean I can go on and on but the coffee jar is still soaking in the sink as I’m writing all of this and my coffee is sitting cold in the machine.

I feel like I have way more energy, enabling my adhd more, too. See, without meds, I doubt I would’ve made breakfast to start with, I def wouldn’t have contacted my friends. But I feel because I have more energy, I have more “classic” hyperactive adhd behaviour. Does that make any sense to anyone? Anyone recognises this?

I’ve been for many CT scans this year and in and out of the ER because they’ve given me so much pain and every-time the doctor has said “they’re too small to take out” which is bizarre.

I've also been waking up in the middle of the night, completely awake like I've had loads of coffee, and that's me for the night I can't get back to sleep. This is only part of it as well. I was bitten in July and immediately went on 3 weeks of doxy, but I have been getting worsening symptoms recently which makes me think the treatment didnt work.

I looked up lyme literate doctors in the UK, it turns out there aren't really any. I know the people on this sub are very knowledgeable about Lyme, would anyone know what a potential treatment plan could be at my stage? It's been 5 months since I was bitten, with 3 weeks of doxy at the start like I said. I feel completely at a loss with what to say to my doctor. He'll probably send me for awful tests to check for everything under the sun and I have a crippling medical phobia. And even if he does take me seriously at face value, he'll probably just put me on more doxy, and that didn't work the first time. Also, I didn't even know about things like Bartonella, and I have no idea how to get tested for that or what the treatment would be.

Sorry for the long post, I feel like I'm groping in the dark for answers. I've seen people here talking about different treatment plans for different stages of the disease, but I can't see anything about what a good one would be for the stage I'm at.",1,1734180904.0,Lyme,0,1.0,False

Happy Saturday morning!  😍🫶🎆 

I hope you're still beautifully, adorably, peacefully still sleeping, and I hope you get to sleep in today!  As promised in your good night email, when I did my middle of the night devotional, I finished that time with pushups and situps and a final exercise 😏 before going back to sleep.

What are you doing today?  I'll be walking over to work when I'm done with this letter.  Saturday is Soup for the Soul with Shannon, and it's usually about 3ish when I get back.  

I'm not sure how much time I'll have between work and walking down to volunteer, but if NOTHING else, I'll write you while I walk.  Have to call Mom this morning, too.

I will TRY to write you Lovely Melody before volunteering, but no matter what happens, you'll hear from me twice more (maybe more) before Soup!

Have a beautiful and blessed day, and enjoy your morning coffee, My Love 🩵💖💛

I’m a 23M Italian guy based in Luxembourg, and I’m looking to find a person to start a meaningful relationship in Europe. This is from my alt account, btw. 

**A little about me:**   
During my weekends I usually run, spend time with my friends and read books. I don’t like loud and crowded places so no disco / dancing for me. I love cooking (here are some pics of dishes I cooked: https://imgur.com/a/zR2VyhW). I have a full time job which I love and hold a Master’s degree. I travelled a lot during my life but I want to settle for now. I'm not religious. I'm open to have kids, but I want to take the decision together with my future partner.

My favorite films (in no particular order):  Napoleon, Interstellar, The Matrix, Gladiator, Barry Lyndon, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Blade Runner 2049, Tenet.

I’m generally a reserved guy, and usually open up only to a few people. I’m a very emotional person. 

I absolutely do not do one-night-stands, and I like to think of intimacy as something special to create a deeper bond with the other person. 

My ideal first date is a coffee meetup, and I also like going out for dinner / watching films together at home (at later a stage).

**What I’m looking for:**  
I value a lot intellect, honesty, and openness. I don't care too much about your age, the important thing is that you're mature and not superficial. I believe the basis for a good relationship is mutual trust and good communication. I’m mostly looking to meet people in real life, but I’m also okay with chatting a bit before meeting up.

**Why am I not using dating apps:**  
I’ve gotten a fair amount of matches, but I find these apps to be superficial. You cannot really say who you are and what you’re looking for just from a few lines and a couple of pictures. I’m not in a rush to find my special person, but I want to try my luck with Reddit, at the cost of appearing a little desperate (I don't think I am). Also, let’s remind ourselves that dating apps are made to generate profits and not necessarily for you to find a stable partner!

If you think that from this description we could get along, feel free to start a chat with me. Applications are open :)

of our budget is $1000 but I'd prefer staying under that (maybe 500-700) but it all depends. Put $1000 in case we can find a sale.

Me: milk drinks only. Ideally I want to make a great latte with nice foam; I also like flat whites, cappuccinos, and regular coffee with milk, etc. 

Spouse: only drinks black coffee so the espresso machine would be used mainly for espresso, and black coffee, etc. 

We've lived in cities with great small coffee shops so can both tell the difference between good and really good, and we'd like a machine that is going to make really good (obviously as far as our budget allows). 

Time: I'm hoping to make a drink to have before work or take for the journey, as well as more complicated drinks when I'm not in a rush. I don't mind a learning curve in terms of time, but eventually will want to be able to make a drink fairly quickly for moments when it's needed. 

Experience level: We think want something that is semi-automatic? We have no experience so something easy to learn but that we can grow with?

Brand: what brand is the best for this? I keep seeing Breville but my spouse is wondering about Delonghi? We are open to any brand but want it to be reliable, well-made and last.

I tried to do research but I don't know any of the shorthand so was getting quickly overwhelmed. 

From what I can tell breville bambino plus, with a grinder might be good for us? Are any of the higher model brevilles better for us? Or a different brand altogether? A smaller footprint is ideal but we can make space for the right machine.

The house is all electric but I keep propane on hand for grilling and we have a 150-gal propane tank for the space, so dual fuel seems like the right choice.

I see options for similar size generators for +-$1000. Looking for the sweet spot for this application. I buy a lot of stuff from Costco because of their return policies, but they seem to only carry up 7500w portable generators.

Sorry if my English is not perfect as this is not my first language

My current medication is 15mg aripiprazole and 30mg dextroamphetamine a day

So back in December when I was 15 I had my first psychotic episode and I had mainly the following symptoms:

Severely disorganized speech and thinking

Severe cognitive problems (could barely form a sentence and was not able to follow conversations)

Altered perception

Paranoia (constantly thought I had a health problem and was going to die and thought I was being followed by police)

Odd behavior and responses

delusions (thought I was a super genius and the government was following me because of this)

Negative symptoms (loss of libido, motivation, facial expressions, and lack of contact with people around me)

My symptoms were really severe to the point I was wandering in the supermarket not being able to think. Barely had the motivation to pick up a glass of water and drink it and dropped out of school

Started aripiprazole in March at a low dose (2.5mg) that was increased slowly over the next months to 15mg. I noticed slight blurred vision for a couple of days when the dosage was upped but this went away and I don't have any other side effects. Aripiprazole helped mainly with positive symptoms and also helped with my negative symptoms a bit although it took a long time to fully work (had continued improvement over a period of 6 months). As my disorganized symptoms went away it also became easier to follow conversations and it felt like the noise in my brain went away. It reduced my negative symptoms but I still had some negative symptoms but then I got put on dextroamphetamine that completely fixed my negative symptoms.

He leaves but comes back in a minute later and goes to the ATM. He’s standing at the ATM for so long I look over and his hands aren’t moving, he’s just looking at the screen… then he leaves again, comes back in and heads to the coffee. He’s also talking on the phone so I ignore him. Until 5 minutes pass and he’s still “making coffee” only the cup is still on the coffee machine. It doesn’t take that long even for an extra large. He had a regular (the smallest cup). Now I’m watching him because we f is he up to? He then proceeds to wander around the store on the phone for a 15 minutes while the coffee remains in the same spot. He finally looks over to me & sees me blatantly watching him, and proceeds to add sugar & milk to his now cold ass coffee. He heads over to pay for it and I ask him if he’s okay? He’s just like “yeah, I’m just on the phone”. I’m like “okay…”. He then wanders around the store for another 15 + minutes talking on the phone sipping his cold coffee. I go up to him and ask him “are you sure you’re okay? You’re just walking around talking on the phone”. He’s like “oh yeah it’s just cold outside, I can go sit in my car if you want”…. He must’ve seen the confusion on my face because my exact thoughts were “if you have a car, why ARE YOU IN HERE?”. I just replied “just seems like something is wrong…” I go back to the “safety” of my register, and after a few more minutes of loud talking and laughter, he leaves… or so I thought! I go out to smoke & call my safe person, and who is outside on the phone in front of his vehicle? THAT SAME GUY. I talked to my person while smoking, went inside, & the guy finally drives away… 

2 days later I’m working 2nd shift & here’s that same guy. He asks me if he “freaked me out the other night”, and I replied “a bit” he giggled and said “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, it was just cold out”.  I just said “have a nice day”. Because wtf do you even say at that? 

Fast forward to today, 3rd shift again. 5am here’s the same dude being weird. He purchased cigarettes and a coffee. I thought he left so I turn around to finish making breakfast. I hear the doors open, it’s him! Now he’s at the ATM again. Again gets out zero dollars. Leaves again, I wait a bit. He doesn’t come back so back to breakfast I go. Then I hear someone behind me. IT IS THAT SAME GUY!!!! He tells me he’s looking for something to open his gas tank… I look at him like “WTF?” And he’s like “it’s okay I’ll find something”… he finds nothing, leaves again. Fuck breakfast, I’m not turning my back again! He comes BACK IN,  to stare at the danishes for 2 minutes, then leaves. I run to the window & see him pulling off finally…. WTF???? I genuinely don’t even believe he was on the phone with anyone the 1st time… WHAT IS THIS???",2,1734178828.0,CircleK,5,1.0,False

The coffee table claims to have this lift-top with hidden compartments and, trust me, it actually delivers on that front. As a guy who loves maximizing utility in small spaces, I just had to try it out.



When it arrived, I opened it and immediately realized it wasn’t going to be a nightmare like some flatpacks from another famous Swedish furniture place (we all know who). Setup was mostly straightforward, though my little cousin was more interested in how you could hide under the table because of the cool box it comes packed in. Doggo was just enthusiastically running around with the bubble wrap.

Interested in the price? [Check it out here.](https://decorgurus.com/product-reviews/functional-elegance-sweetcrispy-lift-top-coffee-table-review-b0dkf2mkch/)

The best thing, folks? That lift-top feature. I find myself using it all the time while I nibble on snacks during Netflix binges, or prop up my laptop for some more comfortable working-from-home scenarios. What’s wild is that my dad, who is skeptical about anything new in furniture (still using the same recliner from the 80s), even gave his nod of approval. The hidden compartment is super handy to throw in random stuff that usually clutters a table – remote controls, chargers, and yes, my magazine stash that’s quickly overflowing.



Now if we’re talking looks - it's rustic vibe seemed to fill the room with a sort of gentle warmth. It might be the perfect fit if you're going for that slightly vintage, slightly modern aesthetic.



But it's not all sunshine and rainbows, let's keep it real. The table’s finish scratches a bit easily. One of my friends managed to scratch the surface with her bracelet. So if you have rambunctious kids or overly enthusiastic guests, maybe use a tablecloth or be ready for a few nicks.



On comparing with other options… I used to own a basic Ikea Lack table, which served its purpose for a while. But comparing the Lack to Sweetcrispy, the construction felt flimsy on the former, zero storage, and no height adjustability. I mulled over the West Elm pop-up coffee table and while it looked fancier, it would’ve burned a deeper hole in my pocket for similar features.



There’s cheaper stuff out there, no doubt. But Sweetcrispy handles what I need it to and then some. I could’ve gone for other variations, like ones with wheels or smaller sizes, but the lift-top version is so far flawless for my needs.



Main thing to bear in mind if you're considering this versatile table? It’s fantastic for its price, but treat it kindly. If you’re heavy-handed, maybe keep coasters and watch those sharp objects. And if aesthetics matter as much as practicality for you, this strikes a great balance.



Would love to hear if anyone else has tried this table, or even similar styles. What do you guys think of lift-top tables in general, yay or nay? Cheers to those of us with chaotic yet loving living spaces!",1,1734178759.0,BestCoffeeTables,0,1.0,False

**So what happens at this meetup?**

*Each week this meet up is held in a pub - we all sit around a table and generally chat about anything we can think of.. that's pretty much all there is to it! There are usually a few who will get dinner from the Thai restaurant at the pub. We get people aged from 18 to in their 60s, but the majority are 24-40. You can turn up at any time, people usually start leaving between 9 and closing, there are nearly always plenty left at closing time (last orders - 11). Currently we are getting 15-20 people turning up.*

**Do you talk about reddit and memes all evening?**

*No! reddit is hardly ever mentioned, there are no laptops in sight and we've had plenty of people who have not used reddit.*

**Can I come along?**

*Of course - that is why it is posted on LSC each week, the meet up is very newbie friendly - we have people new to LSC join us regularly. If you're very very shy don't hesitate to message/text/call me ahead of the pub and let me know, I'll do what I can to get you chatting away with everyone as if you've been every week.*

**What if I don't want alcohol?**

*No problem! The pub also serves various soft drinks, fruit juices, tea, coffee and water. We have non-drinkers often.*

Since after the above people still asked...

**I'm \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is it OK if I come along?**

*We have had men, women, transgender, British, foreign (even a northerner or two), gay, straight, drinkers, non-drinkers, smokers, non-smokers, religious and non-religious*

In fact, the only people who wouldn't be welcome are those under 18 or anyone who is not able to conduct themselves appropriately in an adult social situation.

Please note that this meetup occurs every **Monday**\*\*

**Is this happening today?**

*Is today Monday?*

*Yes: Yes! It'll be today\*\**

*No: Nope, try next Monday\*\**

**Aww, I missed this when is the next one?**

Monday\*\*

\*\* we meet on public holidays, but if Monday falls on Christmas or New Years Day we'll likely skip those.

[Initial meetup.](http://www.reddit.com/r/LondonSocialClub/comments/oudzf/300112_hammersmith_drinks/)

**Location/Time:** [Latymers, W6 8BS](http://www.latymershammersmith.co.uk/) / People often start turning up from 19:00ish but can be as early as 18:30. I'll get there for 19:00-19.30. There are usually a few people left when the pub closes - usually 23:00

Our tables are reserved, we start on the circular tables close to the entrance and we might spill over onto the table(s) nearby. There is no need to book a space/get a ticket.

The first table will either be outside or at the front to the right of the door. (also, there will be Reddit on the reserved signs [And hopefully Snoo](https://i.imgur.com/KIm6pYs.jpg))

There's a (usually quiet) optional Whatsapp group for the meetup - message me via chat for an invite link. (whatsapp group is pretty much only me posting this link each week and trying to get people to actually respond.. So no benefit of being in it if you're not showing up).

I asked her out, and we went for coffee. The date was amazing! I honestly thought she might be the one. But as it turned out, she wasn’t. While she was friendly, it didn’t seem like she was that interested in me, or in dating in general. We hung out twice, and then we kind of just drifted apart.

Here’s the twist: Britney is my neighbor. She lives just two minutes away from me. So, I kept seeing her almost every day when I was out walking in the neighborhood. Ever since I met her, I felt this dominant vibe about her. But it was subtle, like she didn’t even realize she had it.

A couple of months passed, and I thought about texting her about findom. But I hesitated because, honestly, what if she thought it was weird? Having to see her every day afterward and avoiding her would’ve been super awkward.

Earlier this month, I moved out of my house and into another neighborhood. I was so excited because I finally felt free to text her about it. I wanted to bring it up in a natural way, though.

We were chatting one day, and she mentioned how tired she gets from work. So I casually said, “I could pay for your stuff sometimes, you know.” She was like, “What the heck are you talking about?” I explained, “Yeah, there’s this thing called findom,” and I started breaking it down for her. She wasn’t really interested at first but asked me to tell her more about it. I shared my experience with her and then told her to think about it.

A few days later, she accepted. She said we could try it out but warned me that we’d stop anytime she felt uncomfortable. I completely agreed and decided to take things very, very slow.

Recently, she texted me out of the blue, asking me to send her money right away. I got so excited that I ended up sending her more than she asked for!

She told me she still needs time to learn more about it, so I’m trying to be patient. How do you think I can help her open up to her dominant side more? She’s willing to learn but doesn’t know much yet. I’d really appreciate any advice!

also, For someone new to this, what are the best resources or tips I could share with her to help her understand the dynamic better? Lastly, is there anything I should watch out for as we navigate this dynamic together?",2,1734178516.0,paypigsupportgroup,0,1.0,False

Here’s what we’ve learned:

1. **Most of you are playing the long game.** Buy-and-hold strategies (including BRRRR) reign supreme, with the majority of respondents leaning into rentals to build wealth over time. Makes sense, slow and steady wins the race, right?
2. **A significant portion didn’t close a deal this year.** Nearly 60% of respondents reported 0 deals, which could mean many of us are still learning, waiting for the right opportunity, or just surviving a challenging market. If this sounds like you, don’t worry, you’re not alone, and this subreddit is here to help, sometimes.
3. **Some of you are absolutely crushing it.** A small but impressive group managed 10+ deals this year, with a few even surpassing 20. Clearly, some seasoned pros are among us. (Teach us your ways, oh wise ones!)
4. **Creativity is alive and well.** While rentals and flips were popular, there’s also a healthy dose of investors exploring unique strategies: whether that’s commercial real estate, short-term rentals, or something entirely different.

We’ve seen how you’re tackling the market and how active you’ve been this year, now let’s talk about where you’re finding your opportunities. What’s your go-to deal source?

Did you score a property thanks to your cousin's barber's neighbor? Or stumble across a hidden gem during your morning coffee run? We want to hear it all!
