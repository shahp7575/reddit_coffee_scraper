I have met this person a year ago on Tinder, we went out to grab coffee or food a couple times, and we lost touch and started talking again like three months ago. We haven’t been flirty at all, and we only have been going out to eat, explore, and she once invited me to her party and I met her friends. I thought we were just friends but she has been asking me out every week for like two months now, but she’s really outgoing person and has friends around her all the time, so I’m not sure what it is. 
She identifies herself as a lesbian, she is my type but I’m fine as friends, but I don’t know how to know if we are just hanging out as friends or it’s a date?? 
And I got this message today and it made me question more. 
So what do you think and what should I do to make it clear?
English is not my first language, so please think it as a baby talk if I talked weirdly.

1p74498,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1p74498/crush_faltering/,Crush faltering,"We spent more time together today ofc

The morning was whatever. She made me coffee 

We talked for about an hour in the morning instead of doing work -- not like we had to work, we were on a car ride to our off-site, but whenever we do these rides with other people, the conversation is far more sparse

Her body language during the car ride was way more reserved; she even pulled back a bit at one point during a seemingly random part of the conversation 

We didnt talk too much during the work day because I was just way too busy

Then on the ride back we yapped a lot and her body language was way more open

She had the exact same posture as me: leaning her shoulder into the seat with my body position towards the other and our legs spread wide open (and since both our legs were spread wide open, our knees were inches apart)

Conversation was just about life in general.

Then it got a bit weird. She told me about how she likes to be naked at home and we talked about all the situations we've been naked in

I just did ""yes anded"" her the entire time

I have no idea what's going on, but I dont know if I'm crushing hard anymore.

But the polish immigrant who runs the local cafe? While drinking my coffee I watched him come out into the rain to help the elderly woman who had her half price brakefast with him this morning, helping her get back across the road to the bus station, his two sons bring ingredients in from their car in preparation for Christmas day, where they are already fully booked for the meal they are providing for those who are spending Christmas alone, their café is full of people from all walks of life, some who sit around for the warmth, not wanting to go back to their cold house or the street, some who are planning their next big adventure and some who are just trying to survive until Friday. There is a sign on the cafe door that reads ""if you are sleeping rough let a member of staff know, we will feed you and we have hats and gloves to help keep the chill away"". On veterans day they had a big meal for all the local vets, and veterans, NHS workers, fire and ambulance, pensioners, single parents and the homeless all eat there for various discounts. 

It's not immigrants who are ruining this contry, it's your opinions on them, if you treat someone like trash they might never strive to be more, but if you welcome them into our country, our community, you may find one day that they become a pillar of it.

1p743yu,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Culso32/comments/1p743yu/a_totally_euphoric_story_trans/,A Totally Euphoric Story (Trans),"Heya, thank you for reading this! Lately, I’ve been super into the idea of exploring moments of euphoria in the life of a recently transitioned transwoman. Whether the moment is as mundane as having their name shouted out on a coffee order, or as vain as admiring how amazing they look before a night out, I think it could be a super interesting framework to follow a storyline.

I think there’s so many directions the story could take. Whether the character is in college or exploring the world of work, I would love to brainstorm with you and experiment with some ideas! One particularly interesting way of looking at it is if our heroine does not originally consider themselves trans, but has transitioned for some ulterior motive. Watching them come to terms, and even enjoy, their new life could be fascinating! 

I’m really quite flexible with a lot of the story but I do have a very strong preference for realistic slice of life. Similarly I’m open to either play a single character or GM for you, and I love OOC to flesh out the story and plan what’s next. 

I’m a pretty experienced roleplayer in the GMT timezone and tend to start my stories with quite a bit of background discussion to really flesh out characters. This can range from how they look, to what their job is, to their birthday, to what country or time period this is set - I love getting into the details. Once the story begins I tend to write third person and a few paragraphs per response, but I’m very flexible as long as the story is good!

1p74335,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1p74335/narc_mother_in_law_anecdote/,Narc mother in law anecdote,"We once lived in Australia for a while (we are from the UK - so other side of the world completely).  Part of the reason we went was to escape from her behaviour - it never worked out because we didn't escape from it, it just became remote!

When we moved out there, I went 10 weeks ahead of my wife and kids so I could set up home ready for them when they travelled.  

All the while MIL was trying everything to scupper the move, but we were determined to see it through. To soften the blow we told her she would always be welcome to visit whenever she wanted - well she decided this would be best accomplished by visiting immediately, and wanted to come over with my wife and kids when they made the initial move.   This was disguised as ""helping"" my wife on the plane because the kids were young - there was no actual help forthcoming - she just slept the whole way.

When we booked travel for the girls, she asked if i would pay for all the tickets including hers so they could sit together, and she would pay me back for her ticket. I did this.

During the 10 weeks I was on my own, lonely as hell, and money was incredibly tight. I had to find a rental, set up home, buy a car, get some furniture etc...  It was a lot of hard work, and I had so little money I went without food most days (thank god my new workplace provided free fruit and coffee because i lived on it!), didn't do any leisure activities that needed money at all. Lost roughly 10kg of weight over that time. Mother in law knew this and that we were really struggling without the money but was strangely evasive about it to my wife (not me)

When they all arrived in Australia it was great. We had a few days of real enjoyable time together (she isn't all bad all the time) but as time went on, she found fault with everything. Even when we experienced something great - she saw it as a negative because it made Australia more appealing and her mood became icy and hateful. Despite this we persevered trying to show her a good time - during this period she was treated as our guest - we paid for EVERYTHING, all food, travel, activities, eating out - it was an all expenses paid holiday for her.

I mentioned about the plane ticket money multiple times (in my kindest most diplomatic tone!), which she just brushed off, saying she would do it later once she had time to log onto her online banking, delaying it each time. I even messaged my Father in law - who is actually very nice but a complete walkover - Who said he would ask her if its OK to pay but never did.

Anyway - 3 weeks later it came time for her to leave back to the UK. on the way to the airport, she casually slipped into conversation - she felt so sad about leaving us, and felt like we were hurting her on purpose that she decided she didn't feel it was right to pay us the money for the flight and had used the money she had set aside to upgrade her ticket from economy to business class. 

When she said bye to the kids, we left them alone to say their goodbyes, and later learned she had told them that they would never see each other again unless we moved back to England. ",2,1764151760.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False
1p742x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AetherGazer/comments/1p742x5/1_month_in_new_player_thoughts_and_questions/,"1 month in (New player thoughts, and questions)","As the title says, i have now been playing for a month and i thought I'd share my thoughts, and maybe ask some questions..  
  
Firstly i am reasonably new to this kind of game, having only played PGR. I dropped PGR because the characters were becoming overly complex to play correctly, and having to learn 3 characters at once to play optimally just wasn't sticking with me.   
I read that in AG you only play as one character. So that sounded good to me!

So lets get into it. The first bugbear, and the one that i feel has been the toughest one to overlook and keep playing.  


**Level gating content:**  
As of now, i am level 64. I'm STILL locked out of doing things, LOTS of things.  
This to me seems insane..

https://preview.redd.it/86rxjox9ik3g1.png?width=1809&format=png&auto=webp&s=11bdf81e04f3ff4e460f589a60e8d1f30253c240

Why on earth cant i try the harder difficulty? it's going to take at least another month or so to get to level 80. Difficulty 2 wasn't remotely difficult at all.. at least let me TRY IT!

https://preview.redd.it/7bmv86ngjk3g1.png?width=1809&format=png&auto=webp&s=20a14683889191111b50582a71f43e8cff1e1955

  
Similarly.. my characters.   
Locked levels.. I have the resources! Let me use them! They already WALK through any content i am allowed to enter, so it's not like there is a purpose to limiting my level..

https://preview.redd.it/g5ykj7wuik3g1.png?width=1803&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8424fb7e37b22e2367092ffb80d8cb673493bf6

  
**Reset times / Events:**  
Whoo boy, this one took me off guard, some of the content in this game seems to have oddly long reset timers.. Dimensional variable. 40 something days?! what..?   
it took me an hour to clear to Deviation 20, It's a real nice content with the roguelike system that i enjoyed, but then i saw the reset timer. why is it so absurdly long??

Hazard cleaning zone with its 4 day reset? its a 20 second fight.. couldn't a daily reset be better? give us something to actually do each day? **(more on the daily thing later!)**

The Xintai event has been running from before i joined, it's still running and i don't think i have entered that event in the last 2 weeks. The shop is totally bought out, and there is nothing else to do in it.. 

The Ancient shadow event came, but... yeah, you need level 80 to enter it. Great..  
  
  
**Gacha / Team building:**

These go hand in hand of course. At its base, AG is of course a Gacha game.   
However.. outside of my first day, i have not pulled on the gacha at all.. Why? Because there's no way to get the character i need/want, and with each character costing around 18k gems, its not like we can ""risk it"" on the random chance banner.  
  
I pulled Wedjat, sehkhmet, Hades and (Stupidly Tsukuyomi from that 40 pull beginner) banner.. and that's it.. Hades and Tsukuyomi have been in battle probably a grand total of twice when i saw they don't come close to dealing any damage compared to Wedjat or sehkmet.  
**(That's because they need the synergy unlocks! due to power creep, but guess what! are LOCKED!! argggg!)**  
  
so back on the bench they go..

https://preview.redd.it/flhmf5d6nk3g1.png?width=1895&format=png&auto=webp&s=0074cb95b40c3160350e6182a73a8a1097b4af62

I've been running the same Wedjad, sekhmet and hera team.. for every, single, bit of content. It's gotten boring as heck! i want to try something new!

**Daily Tasks:**

it seems there, isn't much when it comes to daily tasks?   
For the last 2 weeks, every morning i'll log in. Send off the Mimir observation post thing **(which i really don't understand its purpose? the shop has nothing until exploration level 5. Again... feels months down the line..)**

https://preview.redd.it/t1whx4beok3g1.png?width=1905&format=png&auto=webp&s=5948b0c5f0afcf0507904feb620f34d9232e986a

  
Then I'll just go into a resource stage (character XP, Joint Training or Awakening material etc.) do a Max energy raid, just to pump up the player XP ASAP and gain a few extra resources... i guess for, characters i dont own yet?  
  
Click my character on the main Screen once, which completes all the daily tasks.. Grand total of 3 minutes, 5 if i stop to drink my morning coffee!

Finally go do the ""awakened potential"" for the obscenely slow collection of those molander souvenirs

https://preview.redd.it/fbvkr1i4pk3g1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=010059b55561d83a14b045a499eaac88cbfa0d8b

I'm 9000/12000 needed to unlock the unit. So maybe another week? But after that? its one less thing to do per day on an already ""hardly anything to do"" per day game?

**Guild content:**  
Honestly. might as well not exist?   


https://preview.redd.it/scv1pdw0rk3g1.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=d18553298872dd5d6c8af2aff7cb5af3331252b0

There's no PVP, its a simple fight once a day no challenge **(often i'll just let the two support units clear it for me)**, yet again for no real benefit other than a shop currency that sells a small amount of the same stuff most other shops sell? Ok i guess?  


**Final thoughts / Questions:** 

Is this how the daily play of AG continues to be? is it really a 5 mins a day game?

All in all. The game is fun, WHEN there's something to do.. but those something to do's seem to be on long cooldowns and maybe are once or twice a week at most.   
There has been nothing that has challenged my abilities at all. I wanted something a little less complex than PGR, but not so mindless that my daughter could play it.   


I've had people say *""come back once you clear IT8""* as a response to the difficulty issue, but i might never get to unlock that, because I'll have moved on due to not being entertained NOW.  
  
I'm logging in daily just to get the light unit, but once i have her, I'm not sure that the drive to log in will be there if it's just to burn energy in a raid?  
I still have some story to play through, i have purposefully saved the story so i don't stockpile crystals and then impulse blow em on a banner because I'm bored (i have done this in other games..)   
I have enough to pull skuld from the advice of others here, but only having one new unit, will that be enough of a dopamine hit, i don't know..

  
**TLDR:**  
Games decent, needs more challenges, needs more to do per day, Want to build more units to keep gameplay fresh! sorry for wall of text!

I’m Setting a Trap.","When I say, *“Go ahead, sue me,”* — or my personal favorite, *“Go ahead and blow me”* — I’m not looking for a fistfight in the parking lot.

I’m inviting the error.

I’m daring you to make the single biggest mistake an ESA letter mill can make: giving me legal authority to pry your entire operation open like a tin of supermarket anchovies.

Let me explain exactly why I taunt you into suing me, and why doing so would be a catastrophic, business-ending move on your part.

# 1. The Discovery Trap — This Is the Whole Game

Here’s the part most people don’t understand:

If *you* sue *me* — you become the **Plaintiff** and I become the **Defendant**.

And as the Defendant, I get something I otherwise don’t have:

**Discovery.**

Subpoena power. Document demands. Depositions. Audit rights. Full access to your workflow, your clinicians, your timestamps, your payouts, your logs.

You hand me the crowbar I need.

If you file a defamation suit, I get to defend myself by proving my statements are true. To do that, I am legally entitled to demand:

* Your patient records (de-identified, but revealing the workflow)
* How long your clinicians actually spend on evaluations
* Whether you perform synchronous evaluations
* Your therapists’ licensing documents
* Your intake timestamps
* Your templates
* Your price-per-letter economics
* Every internal Slack/Teams/WhatsApp message about operations

And then I get to sit you down under oath and ask:

>“Walk me through how you completed a clinical assessment in five minutes.”

You can’t refuse. You sued. You opened the door.

You don’t need to lose the lawsuit for me to destroy your business. You just need to file it.

# 2. Anti-SLAPP — The Part Where You Pay My Legal Bills

Florida has Anti-SLAPP laws designed to protect citizens who speak about matters of public concern.

Consumer protection? Telehealth compliance? Mental-health standards? Housing access?

All public-interest topics.

So when you sue me for criticizing ESA practices, I file an Anti-SLAPP motion. If I win — and it’s not a heavy lift — the judge:

* Dismisses your lawsuit
* And orders **you to pay my legal fees**

That means you bankroll my lawyers while I walk out of court with a smile and content for my next newsletter.

# 3. The Streisand Effect — You Hand Me a Megaphone

Here’s a fun fact:

If you ignore me, you give me nothing.

If you sue me, you give me *content*.

And trust me — I know how to use it.

The moment you file:

* I publish the lawsuit
* I explain your business model line-by-line
* I turn the narrative into “ESA Mill Tries to Silence Whistleblower”
* I syndicate it to the press
* I raise money off your attempt to gag me
* I drag your name into daylight

You take a small spark and turn it into a blowtorch pointed directly at your operation.

# 4. You Can’t Scare Me — I Litigate for Fun

Most people avoid court. They’re scared of the cost, the stress, the attention.

I’m the opposite.

I’ve sued:

* Governors
* Sheriffs
* Cities
* School Boards
* Psychologists
* Telehealth operators

Litigation is my cardio.

You can’t intimidate someone who treats the courthouse like a second living room. I’ve already drafted your counterclaim before you decide whether to sue me.

# The Summary

When I say:

>**“Go ahead, sue me.”**

I’m not bluffing. I’m signaling that I have nothing to lose and you have everything to lose.

You’re driving a luxury sedan built on a shaky chassis. I’m driving a beat-up tank welded together with FDUTPA filings, public records, and a pro-se engine that runs on spite and black coffee.

You don’t want a collision.

I just had my Wilfa Svart coffee grinder replaced under warranty for the second time. While it’s disappointing that both machines have had the same issue, I wanted to commend the CS team on how quick they were. All in all, it took five days (including a weekend) to get a replacement after my initial email. 

Both machines started choking with fairly small quantities of beans, usually worse at the finer end, and the first one outright died. Not great from a QA perspective, but hopefully they’ve improved the design in the four years since my original purchase. 

If you have a machine under warranty that’s starting to bog down, I’d recommend reaching out before your warranty expires as it’s often a few months before the motor will start to die.

It was one of those mornings where everything that could go wrong, did my coffee spilled, my shoes were missing one sock, and I realized I had forgotten my lunch. Frustrated, I decided to grab something quick from a small convenience store near the bus stop. Inside, there was a long line, and the cashier was moving slowly. I sighed and tapped my foot impatiently, when I noticed the person in front of me a middle aged woman carrying a small basket of groceries. She smiled at me and said something like, Rough morning? I mumbled a response, expecting her to move on, but she didn’t. Instead, she struck up a conversation. She talked about her dog, her garden, and how she always tried to start her mornings with something positive, even when everything seemed to go wrong. Then, when it was my turn to pay, she reached into her basket and handed me a granola bar she said I might need. At first, I felt embarrassed and tried to refuse, but she just smiled and said, “Some days, a little help is all we need.”

It was such a small gesture, but it completely changed the way I saw that day. I left the store feeling lighter, calmer, and more patient than I had all morning. It reminded me that kindness doesn’t have to be grand or complicated it can be as simple as a smile, a word, or a small act of generosity from a stranger. Since then, I try to carry that lesson forward. I hold doors, smile at people in lines, and look for little ways to make someone else’s day easier.

1p741gz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p741gz,A Single Picture Was Enough To Break What War Couldn’t.,"Today, while we were fighting off the rain pounding on our torn tent, pushing the water away from the roof with our cold hands so it wouldn’t drown the little space we have left, my father sat in his wheelchair, lost in his phone screen. I walked toward him without him noticing… and I saw photos of our home.

Our home before it became rubble.

I saw the walls where we hung our memories, the tiles that witnessed our first steps, the window that once overlooked a garden that no longer exists. I saw the children’s swing, my father’s bookshelf, and my mother’s kitchen where the smell of her morning coffee used to fill the air. I called my siblings, and we gathered around the phone as if we were trying to touch a life that was stolen from us.

We didn’t speak. The silence inside the tent was heavier than the rain beating on the roof. In the eyes of my father, my mother, and my siblings, I saw the same ache… the same stifled scream. It felt as though the photos weren’t a reminder of the past, but a knife digging into our present.

And when my father turned off the phone, letting the darkness swallow us again, I sat in the corner of the tent on the cold ground and felt a part of my soul burn out. It wasn’t a loud collapse just a silent withering… a quiet retreat from everything we can no longer bear.

We weren’t only displaced from our homes…
We were displaced from our lives.

Our life here has become a constant attempt to survive.
We sleep in tents that breathe cold through every tear, waking up to the sound of the wind mocking fabric that barely holds together.
The ground beneath us is harsh, and the night lasts longer than it should.
Our food is not really food 
just scraps to keep us alive… a piece of dry bread, a can of beans shared among many, and a little water we try to divide fairly so no one is deprived.

Our children grow up to the sounds of explosions instead of songs, and to scenes of endless lines instead of schools. Everything that used to be normal is now a dream, and everything that used to be simple has become an unreachable luxury.

Here, in this tent, we learn that life can continue without truly living, that a person can turn into a walking shadow carrying their body while their soul cries somewhere else.

We are more than two million people trapped in a small piece of land, part of a great nation, yet standing alone without strength, without protection. We have become a burden even to ourselves… walking graves waiting for a moment of rest.

Tonight… the war didn’t kill us.
Tonight, a single picture of our home killed whatever was left inside us.",3,1764151587.0,BDS,0,1.0,False

I walked toward him without him noticing… and I saw photos of our home.

Our home before it became rubble.

I saw the walls where we hung our memories, the tiles that witnessed our first steps, the window that once overlooked a garden that no longer exists. I saw the children’s swing, my father’s bookshelf, and my mother’s kitchen where the smell of her morning coffee used to fill the air. I called my siblings, and we gathered around the phone as if we were trying to touch a life that was stolen from us.

We didn’t speak. The silence inside the tent was heavier than the rain beating on the roof. In the eyes of my father, my mother, and my siblings, I saw the same ache… the same stifled scream. It felt as though the photos weren’t a reminder of the past, but a knife digging into our present.

And when my father turned off the phone, letting the darkness swallow us again, I sat in the corner of the tent on the cold ground and felt a part of my soul burn out. It wasn’t a loud collapse just a silent withering… a quiet retreat from everything we can no longer bear.

We weren’t only displaced from our homes…
We were displaced from our lives.

Our life here has become a constant attempt to survive.
We sleep in tents that breathe cold through every tear, waking up to the sound of the wind mocking fabric that barely holds together.
The ground beneath us is harsh, and the night lasts longer than it should.
Our food is not really food 
just scraps to keep us alive… a piece of dry bread, a can of beans shared among many, and a little water we try to divide fairly so no one is deprived.

Our children grow up to the sounds of explosions instead of songs, and to scenes of endless lines instead of schools. Everything that used to be normal is now a dream, and everything that used to be simple has become an unreachable luxury.

Here, in this tent, we learn that life can continue without truly living, that a person can turn into a walking shadow carrying their body while their soul cries somewhere else.

We are more than two million people trapped in a small piece of land, part of a great nation, yet standing alone without strength, without protection. We have become a burden even to ourselves… walking graves waiting for a moment of rest.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

Yes it has some quirks like all grinders but it's not alot. But there is so much to love, I pulled an great espresso shot just after 2 attempts. And I just now figured out how to make as great filter with a coffee that I find too acidic in it's pure form as with Orbit. All this is with stock blades, I'm gonna change after I've seasoned them abit. I LOVE the sound note when it grinds, not just that it's quiet but it sound's sexy to my ears, and the grounds has a harmony flowing out, in my Orbit the grounds are always gushing out 😂

1p73wus,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1p73wus/coffee_grounds_texture/,Coffee Grounds Texture?,"Hiii all. I am a 30 yo female who has had GI issues in the past relating to my gallbladder. I have had gallbladder attacks in the past, just recently though on Sunday night I had garlic wings from our local wing joint. All was fine until Monday morning around 9am I had loose stool, that I thought was from starting to drink coffee again (literally first cup all year!) I had it all day, in and out of the bathroom. Around noon-ish I started experiencing upper stomach cramping. At first I thought it was my period starting because I was due any day to start. I sometimes do get these intense cramps that feel like contractions so I wasn't concerned. It was getting pretty unbearable around 3:30pm when I got off work so I went and laid down on my left hand side and the pain subsided rather quickly. Around 6pm I ate a few bites of leftover wings. Again all was fine until 1am Tuesday when I wake up in immense pain from cramping and these god-awful tasting burps, like toxic. I toss and turn all night, going back and forth from the bathroom. I take 2 antacids and a single bite from a waffle around 5am and within 15 minutes the pain subsides completely and I'm able to go to sleep. Around 10am I woke up and felt fine. I ate eggs at about noon-ish and was fine all day until around 7pm where I am starting to cramp again. I ate rice in hopes it helps since it's bland. I am starting to feel the urge to go to the bathroom a lot but nothing is coming out. Now, I've been waking up about every hour to cramps and bowel movements and now nausea. Well just a bit ago I noticed in the toilet and on the toilet paper I have very dark brown and small coffee grounds texture bowel movements. 

This is where I'm not sure if it's serious or not. I took (1) dose of pepto liquid gels (2 capsules) around 3pm-ish earlier in the day (tues). I know this can affect your stool color. I don't have a fever, at least I don't think, I am very cold but I think that's just me. I have one of those forehead scanner thermometers that just says 97.4 but I will buy a different one today that in-ear.

So I do not know if my bowel movements are a cause for concern. I do not want to go to the ER if it's not actually an emergency but I'm very much at a loss. I don't really know what's going on. I have experienced similar symptoms to my gallbladder attacks but I'm not entirely sure that's what this is. I was thinking of calling the on-call hospital doctor because if I do have to go in, I won't sit in the waiting room for hours because they think I am drug-seeking and dismiss my concerns. I live in a small city that has a prominent drug issue.

Instant withdrawal casino australia real money,"For the past six months I’ve been bouncing around different casinos trying to find a decent instant withdrawal casino australia real money, and honestly I’ve burned through a stupid amount of cash and patience. In Australia it’s rough finding a solid platformsome chop your withdrawal limits, others sit on your cash for days under review, and a few throw up a massive KYC wall every time you win anything bigger than a coffee. Constant limits, delays, your bank declined the transaction, you know the drill.

In the end, I’ve only got two casinos I’m actually happy to name:

[JeetCity](https://legitgameshub.com/q5FVqD)\-my personal number one. After one pokies session I cashed out around $1 030 and the money hit my bank in under two hours. No random send us one more document mid-withdrawal, deposits land straight away, and support feels like real people, not a brick wall.

[HellSpin](https://legitgameshub.com/hHtjnh)\-this is where I go when I want a mix of pokies and live tables. My last cashout of about $410 went through in a few hours, smooth as. Mobile works fine, no lag in the evening when everyone’s on, and jumping between games is easy.

If you’re also sick of digging through trash looking for an instant withdrawal casino australia real money, JeetCity casino and HellSpin have been two rare exceptions for me that actually pay and don’t fry your brain.

De momento tenho uma Sage Barista Pro, com 2 anos de utilização - comprei refurbished na Amazon.   
A minha namorada tem uma Sage Bambino e andamos à procura de um moinho que seja um verdadeiro upgrade à Barista Pro, que iremos tentar vender de seguida.

O café que normalmente bebemos é o Delta Diamante. Já experimentamos outros, mas este é mesmo o que gostamos mais. 

**Q1:** A Eureka Mignon Specialità é um bom upgrade por este preço? Ou existem outras melhores opções?

Em termos de acessórios, temos apenas os que vêm por defeito nas máquinas.  
**Q2:** Aconselham alguns acessórios que possam fazer a diferença?

Right so… one of my neighbours has just called me a twat for parking on the side of the road on our street.

Everybody parks on one side of the road on our street. I usually park on the side of the road directly opposite my house, and he usually parks on the side of the road (infront of me) directly outside his house. Like, my car behind his, if this makes sense?

I’ve parked in that general section since I got my car. My partner and a family member used to park behind us (like one house worth of space back, to avoid parking infront of a driveway), but now no one uses that area because a huge tree overhangs it and the cars get covered in sap and bird poo. So I’ve just kept parking where I do out of habit and not wanting to have a pooey sappy car.

I’ve maybe parked in ‘his’ spot once every couple of weeks if ‘my’ space is taken. He has never hinted that he had an issue with it… no funny comments, no notes left, no sighs, nothing. We’ve even been outside at the same time loads of times while he’s fixing his car and he’s never said a word.

But yesterday, I had just parked up but was stood waiting for my brother to get a towel as he spilled coffee on my seat. He just got back from wherever he was, he pulled up in his car, got out, walked to his house and shouted to his wife through the front door ‘that tw*t has f***ing parked there again’. When i said what’s the problem, me? He pulled the whole “I’ve lived here for however long and have parked here forever” speech🙄 If anything, no he hasn’t, he has a perfectly useable driveway (that he used to use) but now doesn’t do whatever reason, and started parking on the road in the past couple years. 

He also said he needs the space because he cares for his disabled dad (who doesn’t live with him) and is in and out pretty often. Which, yeah, fine. If he’d told me that nicely at any point, I would’ve happily kept the space clear. But instead he went straight to insults.

But like I said, he actually has a driveway himself but doesn’t use it.

I also took on small side jobs for friends and neighbors. Nothing big, but it helped me breathe and feel in control again.

1. People who fire up their cars then go back inside their houses leaving their cars warming up.  I get it, you don't want to be cold, but leaving an idling car with, presumably, the keys still in whilst you've buggered off back in to finish your CocoPops and coffee?  One person this morning, lives opposite, had left his car idling for at least 15 minutes - he'd gone back in.  He comes back out, the rear screen, side windows, and mirrors were all still thick with frost.  His kid gets in, he backs off his drive (with no visibility!) and off he goes.  WHY?  Why not just scrape or spray off the rest?  
2. Which brings me onto my second irk - people who only scrape tiny little areas for them to peer through, including side windows.  WHY?  It takes a matter of seconds longer to get those done - is it purely laziness or is it just a case of can't be bothered?  

Perhaps I'm just old and grumpy, but it seems to be so common.  Walking down our road this morning - aside from the guy opposite who left his running for 15 minutes, there was a house that had TWO cars running, nobody seen anywhere, and further down two further cars from different houses, with their owners just reappearing.  What's stopping Tommy Thief and Billy Burglar from just jumping in and off they go?

I need some advice about sleep and, more importantly, **studying**. 

I usually try to wake up at 7:00 AM, but the whole morning I feel very sleepy and can’t focus on studying. I’ve tried coffee, Red Bull, or Monster, but they don’t really help me stay alert. For example, this morning I drank one Red Bull after breakfast and still felt sleepy just an hour later.

I can’t be fully awake unless I take a short nap at noon (yeah, it might sound strange, but in my country, napping at midday is part of the lifestyle culture). Honestly, I only feel “truly alive” after noon, around 1 PM onwards. I usually spend the afternoon and evening studying, but it feels like studying only during those times is too little. With the goals I set, I need to study at least 5 hours a day (typical Asian student vibes).

Another problem is that I often lose focus and get distracted by notifications and social media. These things really reduce my study productivity.

At the end of each day, lying in bed, I think: 

“Today I wasn’t productive; why am I always lazy; why don’t I push myself to the limit; I don’t even know what my limit is; why do I let sleepiness control me; my life will be ruined if I keep living like this; I truly want to conquer my goals but I keep losing focus; I suck; I'm a mtfk time waster…”

So, if anyone has advice about organizing study and sleep time, or any tips at all, I’d really appreciate it.

Yelling at us (siblings) and my mom. Every time he’s stress or something is pissing him off, he puts his anger towards us. That’s my childhood. I moved back home recently due other situations, but due to my work schedule and my living situation at home, I sleep over at my partners whenever I can. For the first couple of months, my dad didn’t really say anything but recently he started to make things difficult for me. Shaming me, ignoring me, like offering my siblings food and never mention me. intentionally making me feel bad. My mom is scared of him because she always gets yelled at, but as i grow older I’m starting to see more of him, not just the yelling but the narcissistic tendencies. We haven’t argue yet but I bet it’s going to happen very soon. During my lowest point in my life, my biggest bully was him. My physical appearance changed because of all the stress and just wasn’t able to take care of myself. I was very insecure about my looks and he just kept putting me down. Talking about how ugly ive become. During family dinners, he would point at me and call me old, ugly, and fat. While other fathers are talking about their kid’s achievements and nice, normal things about their kids. Now, I’ve been better mentally, focusing on myself, building a plan for what I want my future to look like. So my focus is solely on that. But to him, he thinks I don’t care about my family and that family always comes first. He calls me selfish, for not getting them coffee, and only grabbed one for myself, he calls me lazy because I didn’t have time to do one task “that helps the family”. I regret moving back home. He say that I care about “strangers” more than I care about my family. Saying that I’m always at my boyfriend’s and never home. And why is that? I don’t get yelled at or shamed at my boyfriend’s, I don’t get ignored or bullied by friends or coworkers? Is it that hard to understand the trauma that he has caused? I second guess everything that I do in life because of him, I second guessed myself every time, thinking I’m not good enough, not pretty enough, just always lazy because of him. But it’s really funny, to hear “family comes first” from someone who literally abuses their OWN family emotionally and verbally. ",1,1764149007.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

I start reading → drift away.  
I watch something → mentally leave halfway.  
Even when I relax, I can’t *stay* in the moment.

Long meditations didn’t help. Breathing apps didn’t help.  
Everything felt like too much effort for a brain that’s already running away.

The thing that helped me (and I swear I didn’t expect it to) was adding micro - pauses like: holding a warm mug for 5 seconds, smelling something (coffee, my baking, literally anything), opening the window and feeling cold air, writing ONE sentence by hand before bed — not a whole journal, just one two lines.

It’s stupidly small, but it kind of snaps me out of autopilot for a second.  
Like a mini “oh, I’m here again.” Not a cure, not a miracle. But the first thing that made me feel like my brain isn’t sprinting nonstop.

I have been trying to lose 5-10 pounds for the last 4 months, but it seems I’ve just remained stagnant. I think it’s because I keep repeatedly binging on the calories I’ve lost plus some. But just last week, I felt like I’d finally made some consistent progress and that my waist looked tighter and clothes were fitting better; but come Sunday of last week, I started a 5-6 day long binge where I felt ravenous and had endless cravings all throughout the day. I binged on anything and everything. Several granola bars, several individual bags of chips, cookies, boxes of cheez-its, a cereal box, you name it. I genuinely felt as though I couldn’t stop myself. It’s hard not to look at myself with utter disgust. I think I binged around 7000-7500 calories in excess (it was much more, but subtracted walking calories), if my tracking is correct. I do have a pattern of excess calorie consumption during the week prior to my period (which I did indeed start yesterday), but this seems way out of hand. I wonder if anyone can relate to this and help me out ? It feels like I’m going to take another month to lose all of those calories I binged. It’s hard not to force myself to fast or restrict to compensate for the excess quickly, I know it can be a detrimental path but I just need some peace of mind.

I don't know about the others but I am a big fan of chai and coffee premixes due to their convenience.

I am looking out for a clean chai/coffee premix that has just to be mixed with hot water. It would be great if the premix was already enhanced with protein powder and other neutraceuticals (lions mane mushroom, magnesium glycinate, l tyrosine, rhodiola or anything likewise) and used a sugar substitute like stevia or monkfruit.

If you are a premix fan, Please let me know if you know about any such products in the market like this? If not, any reason for not being there?

1p735cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1p735cx/sp_certificate_of_successful_marine_repatriation/,[SP] Certificate of Successful Marine Repatriation,"It was early in the morning when I found out that my dad had turned into a lobster.



First came the shock, naturally, and then an odd feeling of acceptance, as, unlike other unfortunates that got blindsided, we saw it coming. His skin had hardened to plates of chitin, his hands twisted into claws, his face elongated into a sharp beak with antennas protruding grotesquely from his mouth. His voice, which had been warm and deep, became weak, rasping, unintelligible clicks. When I last saw him—before I left for work out of state several years ago—he had already shrunk by a foot and was no longer upright. He could only scuttle forward. In the end, they told me he was mostly confined to the bathtub so he could breathe. Indeed, it had been a long time coming.



My sister was home when he fully turned. By the time she called to break the news, they were already preparing the tank that they would be keeping him in for a few days while the release process was ongoing. It would also be the same tank he’d be transported with once the papers push through. My sister had sent me the release form confirming the transformation ahead of my homecoming, and another form from the movers confirming the tank size and our preferred release depth. She wanted the deepest option available, while Mom preferred something closer to shore. They finally settled on the box marked *60-100 meters*, not too deep, not too shallow. With everything arranged and paid, I finally booked a flight and prepared to go home.

Upon my arrival a few days later, the house looked almost exactly as it always had. Same furniture, same stack of mail on the hall table, same faint smell of coffee and lemon polish, but there were differences:

The big armchair in the living room is gone. The telephone rang now and then; someone, my sister or Mom, would answer, speak briefly, and hang up. The door to the master bedroom stayed closed. Everyone else kept clear of it. Only Mom went in and out, once or twice a day, carrying nothing visible except one time when I saw her with a bag of sinking pellets. She had been sleeping in my sister’s room in the meantime. 

Relatives, neighbors, and old friends arrived to visit over the course of a few days, people I haven’t seen for a long time, awkwardly reunited. They gave us well-wishes and inquired about our plans. The bravest ones dared to bring up Dad, reminiscing about the old times. None approached the master bedroom, though, and nobody mentioned what’s inside.

After about a week, the tumult had died down, and the three of us were left silently waiting for the next step. It arrived, as scheduled, on a dreary Wednesday afternoon as two vans rolled up in front of the house. We quietly stepped aside as the movers went to work, with my sister ushering us outside to give them space. When they wheeled the tank out into the driveway, I saw the lobster for the first time, small and spiny, crawling aimlessly across the bottom. 

Somebody handed us more forms to read and fill up as they loaded the tank into the first van. However, someone from the family has to ride with the tank all the way to the release—for insurance reasons. This was not mentioned nor pre-arranged beforehand, but I volunteered. The driver led me inside the back and showed me where I could sit. There were handrails along the walls, he pointed out, although he never told me what I should do if the tank somehow tips or spills over. After that, my sister and Mom said their final goodbyes, as we finally trawled away from the house.

By around three o’clock in the afternoon, we were on the highway. The lobster had settled right in the center of the tank while I watched the air bubbles drift across the water. The jump seat was uncomfortably stiff, while my legs grew numb crammed beside it. I glanced at the second van following mechanically behind. No one spoke, and there was no other sound besides the hum of the vehicle and the gurgling of the oxygen being pumped into the water. Occasionally, a claw twitched against the glass. Mostly it stayed in the center, rocked slightly by the turns.

When we finally arrived at the docks, I helped the driver unload the tank and signed a final form as workers arrived to receive it. I glanced at the lobster for a final time, bobbing in the water as they wheeled it down a long boardwalk with numbered berths. Somebody asked if I wanted to watch the release, but I declined.

When everything was done, a worker handed me a certificate reading *“Certificate of Successful Marine Repatriation.”*

On the bottom was a line for the release depth: *“78 m”* neatly written under.

I folded it once, carefully, and slipped it into the same pocket as my boarding pass for the flight home tomorrow, then turned back and walked away as seagulls squawked at the sound of splashing.

People start grumbling in chat. Someone points out that Outlook has read receipts but our director had specifically turned those off in ""respect of privacy"", which sounded noble at the time but mainly means he wants manual proof instead.



Then one Friday afternoon he sends another long email scolding us because ""only 3 of you acknowledged my update regarding the Q3 dashboard"". He cc's our VP, of course.



In that email he actually writes: ""Going forward, you are required to respond to my messages with a short confirmation that you have read and understood them. No exceptions.""



There it was. The magic phrase.



On Monday morning, I came in early, made an unhealthy sized coffee and opened my ""From: Director Guy"" search folder. He had been with the company for 7 weeks at that point.



986 emails.



That includes every time he hit ""reply all"" to some corporate announcement, every invite, every ""oops wrong link here is the updated invite"", every ""please ignore previous email"", all of it. Technically, all messages from him, all still sitting there marked as ""unread and un-understood"" by his new standard.



So, being the dutiful little cog that I am, I started at the bottom.



""Hi, I have read and understood your email about the calendar color coding.""



""Hi, I have read and understood your email about the temporary 2 dollar price increase in the cafeteria.""



""Hi, I have read and understood your email containing the word 'test' and no other content.""



Copy, paste, send. Copy, paste, send. I only changed a couple words here and there so Outlook would not decide it was a duplicate and auto-thread it weirdly. 



Any time he had cc'd half the company, I hit reply all. After all, everyone needed to see that I was complying correctly, right. Some of those threads went to directors I have never even spoken to.



Our internal chat absolutely lit up about 20 minutes in. ""Why is my inbox exploding with read confirmations from you??"" I just pasted a screenshot of the paragraph where Director Guy demanded replies to his messages. ""Just doing what we were told.""



A few brave souls joined in. One coworker forwarded him his own 30 page ""Vision Document"" from week one with ""Per your instruction, confirming I have read and understood this in detail."" Another person replied to an invite that had already expired three weeks ago, apologizing for the delay but confirming they had now read and understood that the meeting was moved.



Around email 120 or so, my Outlook starts lagging. IT pings me on chat asking if I turned on some wild rule because the mail server metrics just spiked. I told them the truth, linked the same screenshot, and they just responded with ""oh my god"" and a crying laughing emoji.



About an hour later, Director Guy schedules an ""urgent sync"". In the call he looks like he has been chewing wasps.



""I did not mean for you to reply to every historical email,"" he says.



""You wrote 'going forward',"" someone answers. ""These are still going forward through the system, so we wanted to make sure we complied properly.""



You could hear IT trying not to laugh in the background because they had joined to figure out why Exchange was on fire.



By the end of the day, we all get a brand new email from him, this time after a very obvious conversation with HR and IT. It says something like ""After reviewing the impact on productivity, I am rescinding my previous request for manual confirmations. Please only respond when you have a question or action item.""



No apology, of course. But the flood of pointless forwards mysteriously stopped too. Now he just drops announcements in our Teams channel, where read receipts are automatic and my inbox can live a quiet, happy life again.



TL;DR: Director demanded everyone reply to every email from him ""with no exceptions"", so I and a few coworkers dutifully confirmed reading and understanding almost a thousand old messages, reply all where applicable, until IT and his own inbox begged for mercy and he walked the policy back.

Without delay Naruto presses a button and spoke.

""*Hello, citizens of Konoha, it's time for Naruto's daily reminders, starting now!*""

Mizuki, sitting in his cell, began to twitch violently.

""He's in the walls!!""

""*To the person who threw a brick through my window telling me about my good for nothing godfather, thank you and he will be dealt with accordingly.*""

Jiraiya, who was currently peeping on women as per usual, suddenly shivered, it had felt like he had incurred the wrath of Kushina, which didn't make any sense, he was just glad Naruto didn't inherit her temper.

""*And for no reason at all, ladies if you see a white haired man near any hot spring at any point please tell the receptionist that a code perv has occured and you will be given weapons accordingly.*""

Kushina, while relaxing in the pure lands' hot spring, suddenly felt a surge of pride.

""*Anyway, onto the other rookies, including team Guy because no one is safe from me, Kakashi! I know you're not a rookie but Fuck you anyway, you shoved your fingers up my ass.*""

""Eh, that's fair."" Kakashi commented before going back to his book.

""*Kiba, I just found out that you saw what happened during my vacation in alcohol country when your mother happened to be on a mission there, I have paid for a therapist, please see them twice a week.*""

Kiba was lying on the floor while petting Akamaru, ""Why was there cinnamon?...WHY WAS THERE CINNAMON?!""

""*Shino! I know why you wear those sunglasses everywhere and those aren't regular brownies, please come to my apartment immediately, and bring them those brownies with you, I have money!*""

Shino immediately left for Naruto's apartment.

""*Hinata, you might think youve been watching me, and I hope you have been feeling like Rockwell because I'm always watching you, you can see through wall but not through your floorboards!*""

Hinata fainted.

""*Shikamaru, not everything is a drag you're just lazy! Let's hope your future wife is into being a dom, because I know you are not putting in effort!*""

""What a drag...""

""*Ino! My fellow blonde! I know it was you who spiked the jonins' lunch with ayahuasca and filmed it, I respect that heavily and I want a copy of that footage, but be careful you are definitely being targeted.*""

""Couldn't you have asked me for the footage in person?""

""*I could've but this is funnier, I wanna see you scramble, also you are currently being stalked by Asuma, he looks angry!*""

Ino began to run.

""*Choji, please, not everything is about food, we get it, you get hungry easily but have some restraint I beg you, my favorite sushi place was shut down for a week after you visited!*""

""That's pretty fair actually.""

""*Sasuke, I know it was you who sent that letter about my health to the doctors and kidnapped me to the hospital, I know where you live, don't think you can hide from me you emo bastard, I still have to pay those bills!*""

""Mother always told me, that good health is good wealth.""

""*Sakura, please stop sending love letters to Sasuke during d-ranks he never reads them anyway, also I know you had a little poetry fad going on, and if you don't I will read them on speaker will doing an impression of your voice, that isn't a threat it's a promise.*""

""I'm going to clobber that orange halfwit..""

""*Neji, you're basically just Sasuke lite, but they did do you dirty later in the series so I'll cut you some slack.*""

""* Thank you everyone and yes these will continue, no one is safe not even the council or old man Hokage!*""

Hiruzen unscrewed a bottle of whiskey and poured it into his cup of coffee and looked at his watch.

Things that I like about the Baristina: 
* looks nice
* no cleaning a brewing unit
* you clean the filter every time, so there’s no container that catches the ground coffee that you need to clean (no mold, no fruit flies in summer) 
* no cleaning a milk system

1p72x8q,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1p72x8q/the_best_interview_i_ever_had_was_the_one_i_was/,The best interview I ever had was the one I was least prepared for,"A couple months ago I had what I am pretty sure was the best interview of my life and I lowkey did everything “wrong” according to the internet. No 30 pages of notes, no memorized STAR speeches, no perfect mirror answers. I had worked a late on call shift the night before, slept maybe 4 hours, then woke up to an email from a recruiter like “hey, can you chat in 90 minutes instead of next week, the hiring manager had a cancelation”. Old me would have panicked, rescheduled, then spent 5 days obsessively scripting every possible story from my resume. New exhausted me stared at the screen, made coffee strong enough to clean a car engine, and replied “sure”.



On the train there I skimmed the job description once, pulled up their site, and just asked myself one question. “If I was already working there, what problems would I probably be fixing every day”. Not some deep market analysis, just common sense. Outdated looking product, small team, lots of “ownership” language, so probably messy backlog, half finished features, and no one really owning communication with non tech folks. When the interview started I told them up front that I had been on call and might be a little slower than usual, then added “but at least you are seeing my actual brain, not a rehearsed TED talk”. They laughed, tension dropped instantly. Every time they asked a behavioral question I answered in a loose STAR-ish way, but instead of telling one heroic story I kept sliding into “this is generally how I handle that kind of mess” and admitted a couple times where I had screwed things up and what I changed after. I could literally see the hiring manager relax when I said “honestly I used to overpromise in sprint planning, here is how that burned me and what I do now”. At the end when they asked if I had questions, instead of my usual script, I asked “what is something your team complains about that you secretly agree with”. That turned into a 15 minute rant about broken handoffs that I just listened to and then summarized back with a rough plan of how I would approach it in the first 90 days. Walking out, I remember thinking “that felt like a work meeting, not a test”.



Two days later the recruiter called with an offer and specifically said “they really liked that you did not sound like you were reading from a blog post”. The funny part is that if this had been scheduled normally I 100 percent would have done exactly that. I am not saying “never prepare”, please do not take that from this. I am saying that for me, obsessively polishing answers was a way to hide and it came across as stiff and fake. The one time I was too tired to perform, I showed up as someone they could actually imagine sitting next to every day. So now my “prep” is just understanding the company, reading the JD properly, and deciding what kind of teammate I want to sound like, then trusting myself to talk like a real person in the room.

1p72vas,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriott/comments/1p72vas/review_st_regis_bali/,Review: St Regis Bali,"Hey guys, 
I wanted to leave a review for what ended up being the most unbelievable time in Bali. Two of my buddies from college and I just turned 40, so we got a pass from the wives for a boys’ trip. We picked Indonesia as the girls weren’t too keen to go there. We spent 3 nights in Yogyakarta, 1 night at mt bromo, 2 nights in Ubud, and 3 nights at Nusa Dua. The last 3 nights were meant to be a relaxing wind-down kind of part of the trip. We stayed at St. Regis at Nusa Dua. We booked it with pts, that we got for roughly 250k for the 3 nights. 

A few days before we reached, they got in touch and asked us about us, the reason for our stay, and things we liked, etc. We had booked a standard room with a king bed, and they moved us to a room with 2 twin beds and an extra bed (at the cost of 1M IDR a night). We all got breakfast included in that fee. I asked for an upgrade to a better room, and they said they couldn’t as yet, but they would check and see if they could do it the next day. I understood why when I got to the room. There were 2 cakes, one chocolate and the other coffee (made without eggs as I am vegan). A big box of mangosteens (which I had mentioned to them was my fav) (they also got them restocked every day while I was there). It was a big late at night, so we went to sleep shortly after. We found an amazing property to relax at the next day. They have fresh and saltwater lagoons in the property and nice bars right on the lagoon. I got a couple of drinks, and they refilled me at no cost a couple of times. Fresh towels and aloe gel and rose water sprays to minimize sun damage everywhere. The service is next level. The butler brings you what you want, where you want. I loved the saltwater lagoon so much that I spent a ton of time there. When I got back to my phone, I had 5 missed calls from the front desk. 

When I called back, they said they were going to upgrade my room as a one-time courtesy. I went to my room, and my butler accompanied us to our new villa. A two-bedroom villa with private access to the saltwater lagoon. I have never gotten any such upgrade in my life. It was so comfortable. It was extremely spacious for the 3 of us. We spent a lot of the time lazing around the lagoon and at the bar. It was the perfect way to unwind. The butlers were just so nice, checking on us every other hour, asking to bring us coffee, juice, or anything we wanted. A few points I want to highlight: 

Breakfast: Breakfast was very good - the chef made me whatever I wanted on demand. Vegetarian versions of noodles, rice, sushi - whatever. Breads and cheese were great!! Tons of fruit, yogurt, and pastries. They had an ice cream station that I couldn’t try as there was just so much to eat. Fresh-squeezed juices on request. Great coffee and tea. Zero complaints here. 

Bars: I spent a couple of the evenings there, and they have a good selection of drinks with live music. They even took song requests and did well. Very relaxing evenings. They already knew I was vegan and paired appropriate snacks. 

Facility: I mentioned this before - but this is likely one of the best properties in all of Indonesia. I loved the saltwater lagoon that I didn’t care about the beach at all. After I got the upgrade to the villa, the lagoon access was a total game changer. They also have a doctor on site that I had to use. I got bitten by an insect in Ubud and got some rashes on my shoulder. The doctor came immediately to my room and provided a cream that took care of the rashes in 4 hrs. They have a great fire dance along with the sabering at 6:30 p.m. - really fun to watch.

Restaurants: The food was good - and they were able to cater to all our needs. Though the places I went to were fancy, and my pasta had 5 pieces when I wanted to eat a couple of pounds of food :) but very tasty for sure. 

Butler service: this was a highlight of our trip that made it so much more relaxing. The butler was a message away for anything we wanted. Fresh coconut water sent right to you while you are lazing in the private pool. Cappuccino every morning and afternoon when you need it. Restock of fresh fruits and mangosteens if you ever run out 😀. My buddy went crazy shopping and we did not have enough space in the suitcases - the butler handled it all. He packed all the extra stuff in cardboard boxes and ensured the weight limits were okay. I also collect stamps, and the butler along with the front office went out of their way to find st Regis stamps from Indonesia and provided them to me. The butler service even extended till the airport. There was a butler waiting for us at the airport and brought all our bags to the check-in counter. This was just next-level service. 

The rooms were cleaned twice a day - and every night when I came back - the clothes were folded and kept so nicely in my closet. My clothes were pressed and put away - ready to be worn. 

To summarize - this may have been the best resort I have ever been to. They went out of their way every minute that I was there, and even after - till I checked my luggage at the airport. I will definitely be coming back. ",6,1764146995.0,marriott,0,0.88,False
1p72v5l,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravelTips/comments/1p72v5l/my_unsolicited_travel_points/,My Unsolicited Travel Points,"Wanted to add to the (endless) discussion because some posts resonated with me and some didn’t.

Posts like these I scoured through for many… many hours, hopefully it helps someone else.

1st point: Konbinis live up to the hype. They aren’t gourmet, but they are fantastic. We got probably 10 bao buns during our 2 week stay. Plus, we had our one year-old with us and Lawson’s & familymart both had bananas and apples at most places and that was extremely clutch.

2nd point: Google Maps is extremely convenient.

When traveling with smaller children in a stroller, make sure wheelchair accessibility is checked so it will (sometimes) direct you towards elevators to get in and out of train stops.

It didn’t work all the time, but did enough that I recommend it.

3rd point: Figure shopping and New/Retro game shopping

For retro games , avoid super potato. Its cramped, a ton of people go, and its extremely over priced (this is something everyone says and I still went and I know you’ll still go) If you’re in Kyoto, go to Surugaya, i got DBZ Super Saiya Densetsu in box for ¥4,000 yen. Online i saw ¥16,000 yen shipping to me, so I felt this was a great deal. Book offs and hard offs do have games as well, I found surugaya to be best in my experience.

For figures: Akihabara is fantastic, just look up names in this sub and then pick one and as you move to the next one on your list stop anywhere that looks interesting. I ended up finding an unopened mizutsune figure for below retail, and some dbz figures for ¥1,800. Book offs and hard offs also have them and I found some very decent prices but selection was limited.

4th Point, Social Media: take the influencer stuff with a grain of salt. We had 2 “disappointing” experiences and BOTH were IG recommendations.

Now we did come across some good IG recommendations, but zero Reddit suggestions or self research ended up being bad or disappointing.

5th Point: Just get a Suica card. We put ours on our phones and it was incredibly convenient for getting around. Just don’t overcomplicate it, don’t overthink it. Just get one and reload through your Apple wallet or equivalent alternative. You likely won’t listen and you’ll overthink it, by the end of your trip, hell by day 3 you’ll realize it’s get and forget.


Last point for now: This won’t be for everyone, but Don’t bog yourself down trying to plan out every single day and every single activity. My wife is a planner to a T. I begged her not to plan out our trip. She overwhelmingly and Surprisingly appreciated it. With a one year-old, we were resigned to the fact that we’re gonna miss out on stuff. We did two weeks and I don’t feel like I didn’t experience Japan. We didn’t get to do much Yakiniku or izakayas, but we know we will in the future.

I encourage people to pick areas or even popular train stops and just explore. Get “lost” roaming around. You’ll find shops and restaurants that won’t come up on any search of Reddit or social media. We found a café around the corner from us and it was the only place we went back a second time (@lupi_coffee if you want to support a small business and happen to be in Ueno. Just be sure to check their IG at 7:30 AM to reserve the dessert of your choice and be prepared to wait 1 to 2 hours if you aren’t there at 8am.)

Sorry there are so many layers to this so I'm sorry if I get off track 

I (25F) am married (27m) and living with my husband in a family home. We are fortunate enough to have a fairly low cost on our rent (400/m) because his parent charges only per room. We originally moved under the impression that we were needed to help his older (29-30?) sister. Who was living here at the time, but is now not.

We have taken over all responsibilities on upkeep of the house as best as we can, and up until recently (past 2 years) we had been living alone. 

Weeeeell, my mother found herself a new boyfriend which HE IS GREAT I've never seen my mom so happy with a man before. He has a few sons and only one daughter(also 25), she had a few rough things happen right about when my mom and her boyfriend were getting to know one another, they dated for like a year before he moved in with her. 

Shortly after then his daughter found herself fleeing an abusive relationship and moved in with her older brother and his(then) wife and kids. Everything was alright for a while but then shit hit the fan because she was being used for basically all her paychecks and as a free babysitter by the wife. The brother was a truck driver so he wasn't home as often, but according to her would spend most of his time and the money coming from her for rent to work on his SubUwU. So after shit hit the fan and she decided to go to her dad about getting out of their house.

 Now my mom was renting this house WAAAAAY before all this happened, it was like a 5 bedroom house and packed full already before I left because of my bigger family. I left due to some other reasons besides my father-in-law needing our help. And then my sister left soon after or maybe it was before idk. 

SO, when my Stp sis's dad moved in with my mom his son and her girlfriend moved with him because his son was living with him before. I should also mention that my brother, my other sister and her husband, as well as a kid my mom took in were living there too before all this. So safe to say there was no room.

WHICH NOW BRINGS US BACK TO HER TRYING TO MOVE OUT OF HER BROTHER'S HOUSE.

She was sleeping on my mom's couch for Idek how long before this, and I felt honestly blindsided and a little guilt tripped into this next part.
Me and my husband go to visit my mom's house fairly regularly for birthdays, holidays, etc. 

Not. Two. Seconds. After. Walking. Into. My. Moms. House. Does she introduce my stepsister (never met her before then) and then goes ""yeah things are kind of tense right now at (brothers name) house so she's sleeping on the couch here"" and then does exactly what my mom does sometimes which was to leave that hanging in the air with a *glasses down"" looking at me kind of way. As if she's thinking in her head ""and you've got a whole house to yourself""

 I was raised right, I'll give her that much, because the idea of someone being without a bed and a stable roof over their head just didn't sit right with me. And having to couch surf was even worse, so I volunteer to take her in. Which impulsive decisions like that should have definitely been cleared with my husband first. But he's a good man and let it slide because he's very amicable. I tend to be the steamroller in the relationship just because I think with my heart not my head. And that gets me into trouble sometimes as you will find out. So in less than a day I moved all her shit into our house as no one else was available and stink butt Magee her brother said not one word to her or offered to help the entire time (I am also a very strong woman so whatever) and played Tetris to pack it all into my Nissan rogue. And in less than an hr I had her back at my house and unloading and placing her stuff in one of our spare rooms.

All was well for a while, and I informed her that I wouldn't push her to get a new job yet but that she wouldn't just be lounging around the house the whole time she stayed here and at least needed to be looking. I eventually hooked her up with a job at my place of work and everything was kumbyah for a long while. But there were things I noticed about her. For one thing the concept of chores is foreign to her, unless you ask! And then she does things without complaint...
But I started to question some of the things she told me about living with her brother. How she was doing all the cleaning, all the childcare while her sister in-law took extended naps upstairs and barely took care of her kids, how whenever they would make food using things she bought with her own money. They wouldn't even save her a bowl, etc. 

Everything that I witnessed living with her made me feel as though it's not all the truth because of how cleaning or doing simple usual adult things just does not come naturally to her. My best guess is that living with a family full of men, it's like second nature to her to just expect to be taken care of. At least that's how it seems to me and I know this is all exactly what it sounds like!!! Just guesses.

My family is predominantly full of women, with my own mother coming from an abusive relationship with my dad (he's dead 🙃 died when I was 4) it's no secret that every woman in my family could probably crack a walnut with our attitudes, independence, and egos alone. So to me her personality is very much in opposition to mine I RECOGNIZE THAT I'm no idiot when it comes to the matters of the mind as my mom also studied psychology and made it her mission to drill every little bit of what she learned into us as she was learning it. So I'm very self aware that all this is probably just me overthinking things on many an occasion. 

Anyways it's hard for me to justify my feelings sometimes because I feel as though I have been taken advantage of. Not just by my mother but also my stepsister, I didn't charge her rent for more than a year because I was afraid of making everything feel the same as when she lived with her brother. And only recently she has come around and has been paying rent in increments for consistently a month. This will be her second month, for which I am proud of her for doing. 

But it also brings me around to describing her personality and I'm sorry if it seems mean or harsh but she's really the kind of person who dances around things when she needs something, like as if you are just supposed to sweep in and save her. She gives off 
  🥹
👉👈 Pwease help me vibes.

And my mother is convinced that she has attention seeking tendencies just because she also has a condition that causes fainting seizures when she gets overheated. But what I observed is that they always seem to happen around my brother in-laws who are not at all that bad looking from an objective standpoint. Like typical shit women find appealing ""tall, bearded, sturdy, etc."" my own husband, as well as a guy she was interested in at work 
She hasn't had any seizures for a long while during and after leaving my place of work, and hasn't mentioned much about it so I really cannot say that they are real. Probably due to my mom having no filter and just speaking her mind to my stepsister on what psycho analysis she's got on her mind for the day 🤦 

I also cannot say that they are real because when I asked when the last time she went to the doctor for it to check up on it and see if we couldn't get her more independent by trying to figure out her license. She said on two separate occasions 1) oh yeah they said is was caused by this other hereditary condition 2) no they weren't an actual doctor, they were just a friend (of her polyamorus relationship? Idk) 
But ever since frump fucked up Medicaid she now cannot afford to go in and get checked out. 

I need to also mention that my other sister also moved in with me and my husband, because ONCE AGAIN I couldn't stop myself from playing captain-save-a-hoe. Especially when it was my own blood. She worked for a company that works in the middle of the ocean, had a dalliance with a man at work. And now has a kid. Was living with my other sister and her husband and their baby until she got fired and everything became tense over money. So I offered to take her on...

We are paying for both of them 1200/m + utilities and groceries.

Which is not a strain for me and my husband, well... Until I got pregnant and am now jobless. It still isn't a strain too much for my husband to cover but it's getting tense because of the lack of drive from my stepsister to ever get on with her life. As well as some recent drama with my older sister living with us. My sister wants to be out before our child comes because she feels bad for taking up the room next to us and insists we will need it. But my stepsister? No drive. 
Earlier when everything was going on in the country my husband and I contemplated actually leaving the country. And talked about it in passing with her while at work cause it was something to talk about. And she had it in her head that if that happened she would be allowed to stay at this family house that she has no ties to (because it's my husband's family's home) for free. I quickly shut that down. Then we talked about going to the country we were thinking of for a vacation and to explore etc. to which she also was like I've always wanted to see (neighboring country) or maybe move there. To which I was like haha yeah, if you wanna go through with moving though you need a passport as well as a visa to work there. Didn't even occur to her. So I said work on getting a passport and then saving money. And she's somewhat still under the delusion that she can visit this country and stay for the 6m limit without a visa and I'm just doing that John Travolta gif where he looks around while I ask her ""with what passport? You need to save up enough money to afford a 6m stay because you will NOT be able to work there unless they pay you under the table WHICH IS ILLEGAL if not frowned upon in most places."" I told her ""you could go to school there and get an open to work visa."" But I don't know if she's still got delulu concepts about living abroad that she's holding onto.

Like quite literally all this boils down to me trying to get her to be more independent, while also acknowledging how different we are. While also realizing that I have my own child I'm currently growing, and don't need to be babying her. My older sister took on the responsibility of carting her around to her new job and only asked for gas money. I don't ask her for gas money as I feel it would be wrong of me to if it's infrequently being used to transport her places. Like once in a blue moon now that we don't live with each other. 

So tonights reddit post comes from a combination of binge watching AITAH videos on Kallmekris' channel and just being sick of being manipulated. I DID tell her that as we go into winter, I would be happy to pick her up. I ALSO told her that she needed to ask me for said favor. Not just expect me to make that decision all on my own because AGAIN I've got my own problems and don't need to be looking after her and her work schedule like as if she's a child. So I get a text from her that says  

""I'm still stuck at work, was supposed to be off at 9. But I should be heading home soon""

To which I 👍 react
33min later

""Just kidding won't be done till after 10😭""

I send the oof guy GIF 

""Yeah. It sucks""

🥲 Reaction 

10:19

""I am just clocking out""

🫡 Reaction 

""Walking home now"" we all have our location on for Snapchat.

""Aye aye captain"" - me

*Shivering dog gif*
""Luckily I brought a jacket. Because it's cold""

""Yeah that is lucky"" - me

And maybe it's just me overthinking but to ME all of that read as: ""I want you to pick me up but I don't want to ask outright like you told me I needed to. Because you should just be doing it for me to begin with."" 
  🥺
👉👈
And then when I didn't take the bait she decided to point out the weather as well as her jacket. 

And this is not the first time she's subtly hinted at stuff, not just with rides but also other things. There was also a very slight problem in the beginning of us getting to know one another where we would hang out at our local bookstore. And she would butt in before I paid for my coffee and put her coffee order on my bill. To which I quickly put a stop to by making her go first. And also same shit with grocery shopping. I ALMOST FORGOT she had food stamps up until they got fucked sideways too. Same thing as rent I didn't ask for much because I didn't want her to feel as though I was just using her for her food stamps and on one occasion I asked if she wanted to use them for a trip that was for everything we would ALL be eating in the house (I cook, she doesn't know much cooking) she went ""no"" and so I just didn't bother asking again.

She also has this subtle body language tell for when she's trying to act casual while for example in a shopping line or coffee line where she will pick at her nails and play with her fingers when she's trying not to let on that she is hoping you will pay for stuff 
Hence where my depiction of:
  🥺
👉👈 
Comes from because she usually only does it when in those situations. 

I didn't pick her up tonight because I am frustrated that after all of this grace we've given her, she cannot do me the kindness of just acting like the 25yr old adult that she is and SPEAK HER MIND when she needs something from me, like a ride. I don't like subtle hints and pussyfooting around things because to me it feels like a different brand of manipulation.

So I honestly don't feel bad that she had to walk in the cold and the dark. Because you can't pull your big girl panties up and ask for a ride. Not to mention that if she really needed a ride that badly she could have gone to my older sister who works I the same strip/mall/area as her and was also working tonight and ask for a ride. Like she occasionally does. And this entire story has just been a culmination of my repressed feelings. Because unfortunately while I am a steamroller because of my heart. I am also a big ass pushover when it comes to conflicts. And I usually tend to just sweep things under the rug and go ""oh don't worry, it's fine"". 

It's not fine 

None of this has been fine, I'm just apparently really good at lying to myself until I break. Hence the novel here now. ",5,1764146310.0,AITAH,16,0.86,False
1p72pam,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_giveittogot/comments/1p72pam/why_does_it_feel_like_were_in_a_recession_even_if/,Why Does It Feel Like We're in a Recession Even if Nobody Wants to Call It One?,"
When people say we’re in a “mini recession,” the real question isn’t whether the terminology fits some technical definition — it’s why it feels that way in everyday life.

The answer, in one word, is friction.

For most people, the basics — food, housing, transportation, utilities — now require noticeably more effort to afford than they did just a few years ago. And that’s where the disconnect forms: statistical recession definitions don’t measure lived difficulty. They measure economic contraction on a macro scale. But people don’t live in macroeconomics — they live in bills, wages, rent, and grocery carts.

So why is this happening?

Because the system shifted faster than wages did.

Corporate pricing rose rapidly during and after the pandemic — supply chain excuses turned into normalized price floors. Meanwhile, wages didn’t climb in sync. Raises came late, small, or not at all. The result is a widening space between what things cost and what people earn. That space — that gap — is the recession people feel in their bones.

Add to that record-high consumer debt, shrinking savings rates, and the fact that more households are using credit cards to cover necessities, not luxuries — and the picture becomes clear:

People aren’t struggling because they’re bad with money.
They’re struggling because the math changed.

And when the math stops making sense, everything else follows.

Economic uncertainty isn’t just about numbers; it’s psychological. When people start hesitating before buying the same things they bought without thinking a year ago — coffee, a takeout meal, a movie ticket — the entire economy subtly shifts from confidence to caution.

So yes, maybe it’s a “mini recession” on paper.
But in reality, it’s a correction in trust.

And until wages, prices, and expectations realign, that feeling — that low-grade background anxiety when opening a bank app or checking out at the store — will remain.

Not because economists say we’re in a recession.

But because millions of people don’t need economists to tell them what they already feel.",1,1764146307.0,u_giveittogot,0,1.0,False

1p72mhx,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1p72mhx/remote_work_made_my_whole_week_feel_like_one_long/,Remote work made my whole week feel like one long day,"I have been fully remote for a bit over two years now and something weird happened that I did not expect at all. My weeks do not feel like weeks anymore. It is like I live inside one very long day that occasionally has groceries and laundry in it. When I was in the office I had real ""chapters"". Commute, work, gym, maybe a drink with coworkers, crash on the couch, repeat. Fridays had a specific flavor, Sundays tasted like dread. Now Monday morning and Thursday afternoon feel suspiciously similar and my brain is confused.



Part of it is the lack of real transitions. I roll out of bed, make coffee, sit at the same desk where I doomscroll Reddit at night, open Slack, and it is ""daytime"". Then at 6 or 7 I close my laptop, push it 20 centimeters away, and suddenly it is ""evening"" in the exact same chair. My lunch break is just me reheating leftovers and watching half a YouTube video. There is no walk to a train, no ""ok, we are done here, lights off"", no small talk in the elevator that signals the shift from work brain to normal human brain. It is all the same room, same sweatpants, same playlist. Even my cat cannot tell if we are ""working"" or ""chilling"", she just sees me typing forever.



The side effect is that weekends got kind of blurry too. I still get two days off, I am not being exploited or anything, but they do not feel as special as they used to. Saturday errands happen in the same store I sometimes sneak to on a slow Wednesday afternoon. Video calls with friends happen from the same spot as sprint planning. I catch myself answering one more message on Sunday night because the laptop is right there and it feels easier than dealing with it in the morning. On paper remote work gave me way more freedom and I am genuinely grateful for that. No commute, more sleep, I can throw laundry in between meetings. But emotionally I miss the feeling of ""closing the door on the day"" and stepping into a different part of life.



So I am curious if anyone else has this stretched out, never ending day feeling from remote work. If you solved it, what actually helped. Coworking spaces, strict shutdown rituals, changing clothes, evening walks, second laptop for personal stuff. I am trying small things like a fake commute around the block and not sure yet if it works or I just look like a confused NPC outside my own building.

1p72luo,https://i.redd.it/35paiutpak3g1.jpeg,Experience with manifesting SP (so far),"Hey everyone, so recently I have been manifesting a SP. I would say I am fairly new to manifesting as I have always been a logical and pessimistic person. I wanted to share you guy's my experience with manifesting.



A while back, I got blocked by SP and I did not handle it well AT ALL. I did some things I definitely regret and wish I could go back and stop myself from doing. Regardless, within this gap till present time I continued persisting and manifesting him back. The thing is, I have always been very inconsistent with it. I would go back and forth wondering if I truly believe in this. Some days, I had faith. 



He's my man. We wouldn't coincidently end up in colleges within close distance. 



Other days I lost faith. 



It's over. We're never going to be a thing again. I ruined this for us. 



Recently, due to the amount of criticism I received from people telling me to just move on, I decided to send a final ""goodbye"" text (despite being blocked still). However, it wasn't necessarily a goodbye text. All I said was me explaining my behavior and apologizing for it, and I wanted him to stay safe, take care and that I love him lots. I let him know that my DMs are always open and he can text me whenever he'd like at any time and I'll always be here to talk. 



Two days ago, I saw his sweater in my closet and I had a midterm that day. I told the universe and to myself, if I put on this sweater and I fail, I will take it as a sign it wasn't meant to be. I proceed to put on the sweater and head over to my midterm. Flashforward to post midterm, the midterm was SHOCKINGLY easy to me. So at first, I took it with a grain of salt.  



Later in the day, I went out to go eat with some friends. One of them asked if I wanted to make coffee with her and I said absolutely. After making the coffee, I went to drink it when all of a sudden I get stopped:



""Hey, there's an initial on your coffee!"" my friend says.



""Huh?"" I ask, confused as hell.



""Yeah, let me take a picture."" 



She takes the picture and I turn the cup around, AND IT'S SP'S INITIAL, A, CLEAR AS DAY.  



""OMG WHAT THE HELL??"" I say in shock.



""Yeah, you didn't do intentionally?"" My friend asks.



""No, but oh my gosh that is so cute."" I played it off like it was my initial, but deep down, I believe that it was my manifestation.



I genuinely believe that is a sign. I would have doubts if it didn't even look close to the initial, but it was genuinely the most perfect initial I have ever seen.



After seeing that, it definitely encouraged me to continue manifesting and believing. 



Any thoughts, opinions, tips would be appreciated on this manifestation journey. <3

I'm 17 weeks pregnant and let me tell you, I CAN FEEL IT. The bump may be small, but the pain is big. It wasn't like this during my previous pregnancy, and so my husband and I were both quite surprised when already 2 months ago I began to have really bad joint pain, which, like everything else that feels apocalyptic during pregnancy, the doctor said was ""normal."" Now that pain has festered and developed into really bad back pain. My husband has been super supportive: hasn't missed a doctor's appointment, helps me when I'm nauseous or when something's too heavy, etc. 

 About a month ago, I first asked my husband for a backrub when the pain became pretty uncomfortable and he told me he was too tired. The next day, I asked again, and he briefly massaged my lower back with some body cream, and even that felt like a form of relief, but he kept saying, ""I don't know what I'm doing, this feels weird,"" etc. Since then, he has basically full-on refused to give me a backrub. He hasn't given a broad reason, there's just always just an excuse like ""I'm too tired"" or ""I just wanna relax."" For context, he has really long work days and comes back absolutely exhausted and all he wants to do is sink in front of a good video game, which I totally understand. 

At the same time, my back pain has gotten literally excruciating. It's really hard to find a masseuse that specializes in prenatal massages in the area we live in and even if I did find someone, they're incredibly expensive and so I could only get 1 or 2 for the entire pregnancy.

About 2 weeks ago, I confronted him head-on and told him I really need just 2 minutes here and there throughout the week in which he gives me a backrub. He began giving me the usual, saying he is usually too tired by the time he gets home or that he doesn't have enough time in the day. I pleaded with him and told him that the kind of pain I'm in is solely from the pregnancy and I need him to be my partner in this and help me out. He told me that he agreed and would try to do more even though he ""really doesn't know what he's doing."" I made it clear to him that I don't need him to be anywhere near a professional masseuse, just a light backrub to help ease the discomfort in any way.

Since then I have literally received 0 backrubs. I've asked him several times and each time he once again gave me the same usual excuses. Today we were lying in bed and chatting and I suddenly felt a literal spasm of pain in my lower back that was acutely painful. I yelped in pain and rolled over, and he patted my back in a ""there there"" fashion. Even then, when I asked, he refused to rub my back. I had just about had enough. I burst out, ""Do you have a specific problem with giving me a backrub? I'm pregnant, for God's sake. Do your part."" He got really upset and told me that I was overexaggerating, that he was still half asleep from waking up.

I made it clear to him that I really appreciate everything he does to pick up the slack from me being slightly less functional than normal during pregnancy, such as more dishes and more taking out the trash, but that when it comes to my physical wellbeing, I just need a damn backrub here and there. I'm carrying OUR baby and right now, it feels like I'm doing it alone. He basically heard none of what I said except that last part and said, ""Are you kidding me? You think you're alone in this? After everything I do?""

We basically didn't talk after that. We made each other coffee, which we do every morning, and then he went off to work, and I started my work from home. So Reddit, am I the asshole?

Us party 'B'  purchased a café in Autumn 2025 from party 'A' which we were sold under the pretext that all fixtures and fittings were sold in a good working condition, which was detailed in an inventory provided by 'A' and his solicitors. 

However since relaunching last week, we have had increasing issues with the premises and equipment that we inherited as part of the sale. These range through the following:

- Damaged or broken equipment including a coffee machine without a valid PSSR certificate, which we were not made aware of and was sold in a good working order. We have had to spend £2500 on a new coffee machine as the previous one was too badly damaged to repair, as verified by a certified technician.

-As well as this one of the freezers has a suspected electrical fault which caused a loss of £300 in stock during opening week. 

- An electrical engineer has been called twice in this week amounting to costs of C. £450 due to potential problems in the electrical system, to which no certificate was issued with the sale. 

- We were required to replace an oven at costs of £1500 despite being told that we were receiving this equipment in working order. 

As this was our first business purchase, we used a solicitor to oversee the sale and party B did the same. 

Is there a legal obligation from the seller to take responsibility if he has knowingly misled us? 

We do not want to unwind the sale as we have made C £25,000 in renovations to the café, but we are curious to understand if there is a legal route to take to potentially claim against being mis sold considerably unsafe and expensive equipment as part of the sale, as this was all described in good working condition.

Wanted to contribute a free post from my Substack below, if this is an enjoyed vibe I'm happy to drop my other free articles in here too. All stories scent-related. I guess the closest flair to this is a review?

\-

I’ve been debating how and when to approach this one, it is a sore spot for me. I’ll keep it on the topical side.

I went no-contact with my mom about two years ago. She has her struggles and I have mine, and they couldn’t complement each other at that time. Or any time, really. It’s a strange feeling when it occurs to you that that you probably would not be a good match with your parents in the context of any other relationship. She is a good person. I am a raw one. I am independent. She is not. We would make miserable classmates, coworkers, or party acquaintances.

She is a part of my very necessary first perfume memory story, the one that every fragrance enthusiast has. Our stories of firsts are typically one of two: we watch our mothers put fragrance on in the mirror before leaving the house, or we open our grandmothers’ medicine cabinets and vanity drawers to find vintage scent bottles. I was fortunate to have had both.

Around 2005-2006, I lived in France. The situation was significantly less boujee than it sounds. My dad lived there as an Algerian immigrant. I assumed work was what brought him out of Algeria, but he always seemed to have a shadowy, peculiar resentment for those who presented more Algerian than him. Funny how the grapple with the self can project outward when held against the contrasting background of a very white society. He would never in a million years admit he felt that way, but you could pick it up in small tones, comments, memories cross checked with my mom later in life.

[](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7urm!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5259f158-99f6-4d81-ad1c-8ddd332bf9a0_750x1046.png)

I was young and attending school at that time, called *CP* for first grade. There was an outdoor shopping center a few streets away from our second floor apartment. One sunny day, perhaps a Wednesday when kids my age were allowed to stay home from school, my mom took my hand and we went out through the rusty orange door and over the narrow streets and cobblestones to the mall. She stopped in a perfume shop past a few clothing stores and the Virgin Mega store. I could not tell you if there were virgins in there, nor could I tell you if there was anything mega about them. It was simply not my six-year-old business.

This was a perfume store that had a cafe up front. I remember my mom being so charmed by that. I’m not sure if the cafe was technically separate, but I like to think they were one big marvelous entity, a place that spoke to two of my mom’s instincts at once. I have the same coffee-to-scent instincts now, too. Could be nature, could be nurture.

We went inside and up some stairs. Against a white wall, there sat the pink Kenzo Amour. My mom picked it up and fell in love with it quickly. Knowing her, the rice note drew her in first.

I’ll tell you what Kenzo is not before I tell you what it is. It is **not** watery, it is **not** thin. It is not refreshing, nor is it freeing. Kenzo Amour is plush and cloying, like horchata with a tea base. The frangipani pulls like almond. It is an incredibly *round* scent. My mom loved things that were overt, but not definitively so. This lives in a gray area between a gourmand and a fantasy, where whichever of the two you are accused of being, you can claim to have slipped into the other. Flirty, but innocent. Sweet, but with depth. In my memory, she bought it immediately.

Years later and post-divorce, we had found ourselves back in the United States for quite some time. One hot Arizona August, my stepdad bought her a fresh bottle of Amour. It was in the same almost-lipstick shaped and definitely-lipstick colored bottle. We hid it in plain sight among her other bathroom staples and laughed to each other, giving no explanation until she found it. Once you become an adult, surprise gifts hidden among your everyday things reduce dramatically in frequency. I think she felt incredibly special that day.

More than ten years after that, on a Facetime call with her, I bought her another bottle. My small family typically did not do gifts for Christmas, but I liked to buy her something anyway when I could. I kept her gifts undisclosed to the other family members and bought myself a bottle, too. As of just a few weeks ago, it sits on my mirror tray with only a few sprays left.

My recent up-close time with Amour coincided with unexpected sickness. I wore it on a thrifted jacket over a denim jumpsuit, and left work early that day after vomiting right before a meeting. How jarring to have gray hairs and a 401k, but still get caught in the crossfire of a surprise puking session. I am still thinking of the thick rice milk emanating off of the jacket, mixed with the overly aldehydic bathroom freshener going off every so often. Leaning over, heaving, standing, pacing, checking my phone, leaning over again. It is still so vivid. I’m not sure I’ll finish that bottle, I think that was the end of my very long journey with that fragrance.

But I still owe you a thank you, Kenzo. You do make me a bit uncomfortable, for more reasons that one, but thank you for holding so much for me inside your modern-abstract bottle.

1p72eut,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1p72eut/20251126_mama_rat_and_papa_rat/,2025/11/26 mama rat and papa rat,"i read 'the shining' one fall and it was amazing.  that book was in my head the entire fall and with me everywhere and it was just great.  i won't even really say how it compares to the movie because they're almost entirely different things and they're both classics.  i will say, though, that the book had *a lot* of scenes that were omitted, all of which i really liked.  an aspect that also didn't translate so well to the movie was the whole 'entity' nature of the overlook, and how it had it's own intent.  the movie kind of touched on it with the bar tender and party in the ballroom at the end, but in the book there was a heavier focus.

the ballroom party matched with jack's declining mental state and was key in the culminating tension between him and his family in such a perfect way.  he kept denying there even was a party, so he was lying to his wife (trust and relationship gone, plus crazymaking), insane to so blatantly deny what was obvious (his own mental decline) and the whole atmosphere was just unbelievably tense.  i think my absolute favourite part of that situation was that jack came up from the first floor in an elevator that was full of party favours, or decorations at least.  like, balloons and confetti and streamers.  wendy basically picked them up and threw them in his face like 'how tf are you telling me there's nothing going on??!!'

and that was another angle.  not only was he mad, it was like this was the power of his madness and mind, that it had manifested a whole goddamn party.  and that was a thing about the overlook, that it's not like the ghosts there can't hurt you, they can because they're real.  again, i guess, fitting with the whole theme about the power of the mind.  

this also reminds me of what's known as a 'tulpa' and another theme in the shining, being the crossover between the mind (or psychological) and the paranormal.  google says a tulpa is 'largely viewed as a psychological, rather than paranormal, phenomenon'.  basically, it's just a meditation or intense focus that brings something into being.  i'm not sure where i read this, maybe 'the occult world of john pendragon', but i read somewhere about a writer who was really prolific and did a series of some kind for 'the shadow' (*Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!*) and basically locked himself in his room writing for months.  people who rented the room after him started reporting sightings of something/someone like 'the shadow' in that room.  certain people say this is a tulpa he manifested by accident basically just through his intense focus.

anyway, today was a good day in the shower because i finally threw out the sliver of bar soap i had left and got to start a [new soap](https://imgur.com/txkwueb), which is my favourite kind.  the last bar was the same brand, but the african black soap.  it's nice but the shea butter scent is my all-time favourite (it's got frankincense and myrrh). 

i didn't dream of anything dead last night, but i did have a weird one.  i was enrolled in some sort of post-secondary course and had to do two or three... not marathons or anything but sort of running tours of a neighbourhood?  we were also supposed to have signed up for these things in some convoluted way i never even knew about, so i did the first one to find out it didn't count.  i had to book a time to make it up and there was only one slot left, so not only did i have to re-do what i'd already done, i'd have to do all the tours on the same day, which i wasn't sure i was physically capable of doing.  later on i was in a mall in australia looking for somewhere to buy ice cream because i'd seen someone getting some from a freezer or cooler but then couldn't find it again.  then it turned into a horror video game with simpsons characters and a sinister mall food court with similar graphics to super mario 64, which isn't a horror game but for some reason always freaked me out.  

[breakfast](https://imgur.com/5p19XJ3) today was basically the usual.  later i made a [spinach dip](https://imgur.com/2XL2bPD) that was about 60% spinach and had it with a naan, which turned out to be a good idea so i had [another naan](https://imgur.com/7FJYdZC) with this dip and a bunch of roasted vegetables and a hot chocolate.  then for [dinner](https://imgur.com/fZM88QP), guess what, another naan with curry and some cheetos.
