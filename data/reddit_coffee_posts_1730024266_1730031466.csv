I recently bought Hibrew h10a with hibrew G5 grinder, I'm having trouble dialing in the espresso I'll elaborate below.

1. First attempt was made with beans that we're light roast and quite old so all I got was extremely sour shots that ran in 15 secs, I figured that my beans are stale (roasted 4 months ago) so I gave up on them.
2. Second attempt was with the beans that were roasted around first week of September and similar thing happened (btw it says filter roast on the pack) and enough pressure was not generated,  it showed that the pressure was around 8-9 bars on the machine.
Further just for the sake of experiment I tried grinding finer ( I was grinding the finest espresso setting up until that point on the g5 grinder, this time I went into Turkish coffee range) 
RESULT: more pressure was generated this time, the shot ran 5 sec slower ( 20 sec now) and obviously espresso was bad.
 
Now comes the question 
1. Is this a stale beans problem?
2. Or grind size issue?
3. If it's a grind size issue, is anyone familiar with the Hibrew G5 grinder and can I calibrate it to grind finer? Because I was pretty much at end range for the 20 sec shot which generated high pressure.

Any kind of help or insight is helpful, please do share your thoughts. 

Thanks in advance. ",1,1730031278.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
1gd9kqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1gd9kqb/friends_and_family_a_new_beginning_chapter_22/,"Friends and Family: A New Beginning, Chapter 22 (Part 2)","A little after one o’ clock in the morning, Jim felt something tapping on his shoulder.  It woke him up like a thief from sleep in the middle of the night.  Jim thought, *It must be Caitlyn, scared of a thunderstorm, as usual*. 

Jim sluggishly woke up and looked up.  Whoever it was turned on the lamp.  But it wasn’t just anyone.  It wasn’t even Caitlyn.  It was Sydney.

Jim softly and slowly asked, “Sydney, what is it, honey?”

Sydney was wearing nothing more than an oversized T-shirt.  She said, “Jim, I had to see you.  I guess the storm is scaring me.”

“I expected that from Caitlyn.”

Sydney squatted down to Jim, then she said, “Jim, I know my family and our friends asked you when you plan on letting me sleep in the bed with you.”

“Sydney, I’m pretty sure we’ve had this discussion.  We are not married, and I just don’t feel we should share the bed until marriage.”

Sydney took Jim’s hand, and she said, “Yes, Jim.  I know that, and I also know you and Candi saved yourselves for marriage.”

Jim looked into Sydney’s eyes, which looked like they were about to well up with tears.  He did not want to upset her, just as things were getting serious.  And to add to that, in a matter of days, Jim would ask Sydney to marry her.  Jim wanted to tell Sydney to go back in the guest room and go back to bed.  But before he could, Sydney said with sobs, “Jim, you know I love you.  I also know we’re not married.”

Sydney broke for a moment, and then she cried as she said, “Jim, please.  I would like it if I could sleep with you now!”

Jim got himself up.  He gave Sydney a hug.  He must have held her for at least two minutes.  Then he finally said, “Okay, Sydney.  Get into bed.”

Jim held Sydney’s hand as he led her to what would be her side of the bed.  Jim turned the covers, and then Sydney got into bed.  Sydney covered herself up just as Jim made his way to his side of the bed.  Jim got back into bed and covered himself back up.  Sydney said to him, “Thank you, Jim.  I love you, and I won’t do anything you don’t want to do right now.”

Jim smiled at Sydney.  He took her hand.  It was not long before Jim was starting to get some warm and fuzzy feelings, just like he did with Candi.  Sydney put her hand on Jim’s upper leg.  Jim took her hand, and he softly kissed it.  After a few minutes, Sydney drifted off to sleep.  Jim turned off the radio and lamp, and then he went back to sleep.

 

😊

 

The next morning, Jim woke up to find Sydney was not in the bed.  He looked at the clock radio.  It said 6:45 in the morning.  Jim wondered where Sydney was.  He got himself dressed and he made his way downstairs.  He saw Chelsea in the living room.  Jim asked her, “Chelsea, do you have classes today?”

Chelsea answered, “No, Dad.  But I do have to work today.”

Then, Jim happened to remember.  Friday.  Chelsea did not have classes on Fridays.  Chelsea did have to work today from noon until four at the nearby Walgreen’s.  Jim asked her, “Chelsea, do you still want to go to Faulkner Motors with me after you finish work?”

Chelsea said, “Yes, Dad.  I do.  You still plan to look at that car Papa Walter wanted you to look at?”

Jim answered, “Yes, I do.”

Chelsea said she was about to go upstairs and tell her sisters to get up and get ready for school.  Meanwhile, Jim made his way into the kitchen.  He saw Sydney taking a skillet out of one of the cabinets.  She was still wearing that oversized T-shirt she wore last night.  Jim asked, “Sydney, what are you about to do?”

Sydney answered, “I think I will make us breakfast.”

Jim asked Sydney, “And just what are you planning on making?”

Sydney walked to where Jim was standing.  She stood in front of him, putting her two legs together.  She smiled and gazed her eyes at him.  She finally said, “Jim, I think I will make us some eggs and bacon, some toast, and some grits.  Does that sound like a good breakfast?”

Jim let out a little laugh, gave her a kiss, and then he said, “Sydney, I think that’ll be great.  It’s about time my girls had a decent breakfast.  They do eat too much sugary cereal, anyway.”

Sydney turned and walked toward the stove.  Chelsea walked down the stairs and said, “Dad, I don’t eat that sugary cereal.  You know that.”

Jim said, “Yes, Chelsea.  I know that.  You eat bagels with cream cheese.”

Then Sydney said, “Yes, Chelsea.  Yesterday, while I was at the store, I got you some bagels.  But I also got you a different kind of cream cheese.”

“Sure, Sydney.  What is it?” Chelsea asked.

Sydney answered, “Garden vegetable.  I thought you might like it.”

Chelsea said, “Thank you, Sydney.  I don’t think I ever had it before.”

On a radio in the kitchen, a radio was playing some classic rock.  Steely Dan.  *Do it Again*.  Jim went to the bottom of the stairs.  He shouted, “Girls!  I hope you are all up and getting dressed!”

Lauren said, “I am, but Valerie is taking her time in the bathroom.”

“Then tell her to step it up,” Jim said.

Lindsay made her way downstairs.  She said, “Dad, good luck with that.  You know how Valerie can be in the bathroom.  She’s so sluggish in the mornings.”

Caitlyn soon showed up.  Jim asked her, “Caitlyn, how did you sleep during that bad storm last night?”

“Dad, I slept like a baby.  That storm didn’t scare me one bit.”

Jim smiled and said, “Okay, you girls head to the kitchen.  Sydney’s starting breakfast.”

Jim started to make his way upstairs.  He made it about halfway up the stairs when he saw Lauren and Valerie start their way downstairs.  Lauren was wearing a dress.  But Valerie, being Valerie, was wearing her usual thing.  A sweatshirt (with what appeared to be a T-shirt underneath), scuffed up tennis shoes and a pair of jeans with holes in the knees.  Jim would say something about that.  But this time, he didn’t.  But he did say, “I hope you girls are in the mood for a decent breakfast this morning, because that is what Sydney’s fixing.”

“It sure smells good,” Lauren said.

Jim said, “It does.  You girls be sure and tell Sydney that.”

Four of the girls did say that to Sydney.  Valerie didn’t.  She did try to get a bowl out of the cabinet.  Valerie attempted to make her a bowl of Fruity Pebbles.  But Jim stopped her.  He said to her, “Freeze it right there, Valerie.”

Valerie gave Jim a rather murderous look.  He said, “Valerie, it just so happens Sydney is fixing eggs, bacon, toast and grits for breakfast.  You can eat that just like your sisters.”

“Dad, do I have to?” Valerie asked Jim.

“Yes, Valerie.  You do.”

Jim took the box of Fruity Pebbles from Valerie.  She finally agreed to have a decent breakfast with the others.  Chelsea did agree to eat eggs and bacon, but instead of toast, she opted for a bagel with garden vegetable cream cheese.  They all spent about fifteen minutes eating their breakfast.  There were no complaints, even from Valerie. 

After they got done, Jim got all the girls (except Chelsea) to finish getting ready for school.  Ashley and Toni showed up.  They both offered to take Jim’s girls to school.  Ashley was going to drive her son, Dakota, to school.  Dakota was now attending Radcliffe Middle School with Lindsay.  Ashley said she would be happy to drive Lindsay to school this morning.  Toni was on her way to her new job at a medical office near Carolinas Medical Center, where she was now working as an assistant for a pediatrician.  She started that job on Monday of that week.  Toni said, “Jim, I go right by Dilworth Elementary, so I will be glad to drive Valerie and Caitlyn to school if it’s okay with you.”

Jim said, “Sure, Toni.  That’ll be great.”

Ashley and Toni saw Sydney in the kitchen, washing the dishes.  They said hello to her.  Then Jim asked her, “Sydney, why don’t you put those dishes in the dishwasher?”

Sydney answered, “I don’t mind, Jim.  Really.  Besides, they’re not that many.  After I get done, I’ll be getting ready for work.”

Jim said, “Okay, Sydney.  Svetlana will be here any minute.  Just put the dishes in the drain board, and Svetlana will put them away.”

Sydney said she would.  Lauren was almost ready to leave for school.  Jim asked her how she was getting to school.  She said, “Donnie Courtland agreed to drive me and Christie to school.  He should be here any minute.”

Jim said to Lauren, “It sure is nice you have some friends who can drive you to school, especially where you are now, with you in your final year of high school.”

Lauren said, “Yes, Dad.  You know it’s nice to have friends, period.”

“Yes, Lauren.  That is true as well.”

Jim, Sydney, Ashley and Toni all smiled when Lauren said that.  They had to remember one special moment.  That moment in the summer of 1984.  That moment at that house in Lansing, North Carolina, in the mountains in the far northwestern corner of the state.  That was when Jim and his friends made that special promise, the one to stay friends, no matter what.  So far, they never broke it, even though two of those friends were no longer with them.  Candi Faulkner and Todd McClendon.  Toni and Jeremy were not with them at the time because it was a church youth ensemble trip and they had just been born, but they would make that promise with those friends in later years.  Over the years as more friends arrived, they were included in that special promise.  Years later, the kids of those friends made a similar promise.  Just like Jim and his friends, the kids have not broken that promise, either. 

Lauren got a look out the window.  She saw Donnie Courtland pull into the driveway in his car, a red 1973 Chevy station wagon with wood grain trim.  Christie, his sister, was riding shotgun.  Lauren grabbed her book bag, and she said, “Dad, I must go.  Donnie and Christie are here.”

Jim walked with Lauren to the front porch.  He gave Donnie and Christie a wave.  They waved back.  Ashley and Toni rushed past Jim, with his three youngest girls with them.  After they said their good-byes to Jim, they were all off to school.  Donnie’s station wagon was the last car to leave the Faulkner house.  After Donnie left, Svetlana showed up in her little Oldsmobile.  She parked in her usual spot, at the curb in front of the house. 

Sydney had finished putting away the dishes when Jim and Svetlana stepped into the kitchen.  Sydney said, “Hi, Svetlana.  Jim, I am about to finish getting ready for work.”

Jim had gone up the stairs when he said to Svetlana, “Okay, Svetlana.  There is a good possibility that I’ll be late coming this evening, along with Chelsea.  But my other girls should be home on time this afternoon.”

“Sure thing, Jim.  What’s going on with you and Chelsea?”

“There is a possibility I may be buying a car from Dad today.  Chelsea may also be buying a car from Dad as well.”

“Jim, that’ll be great.  What car will you be getting?”         

“If I can get it, it’ll be a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade.”

Jim showed Svetlana a picture of it on his cell phone.  Svetlana said, “Jim, that is one nice car.”

“Thanks, Svetlana.  Dad said he can get me a good deal on it if I’m interested.”

Then Svetlana asked Jim, “What kind of car will Chelsea be getting?”

Jim said, “There are two cars she has her eye on.  One is a Chrysler convertible, and the other is a Camaro with T-tops.”

“Which one will she get?”

“She hasn’t decided.  But I hope she gets something she wants, and something she’ll be happy with.”

“So do I, Jim.  I wouldn’t mind getting another car, but right now, I’m stuck with what I’ve got.”

“Go see Dad at Faulkner Motors.  He can help you get a good deal on a car.”

Jim knew that Svetlana’s Oldsmobile had been giving her problems.  He knew that, sooner or later, she would have to get another car.  In addition to her job as Jim’s housekeeper, Svetlana also worked Saturdays at the Sunbeam Bread Store, and twice a week at the nearby Home Depot.  Between her housekeeping job and her job at the bread store, Svetlana did not make a whole lot of money.  So, Svetlana would have to get a used car.  There was Faulkner Motors on South Mint Street.  If Svetlana made the decision to buy a used car there, there would be a good selection.

Svetlana said she would go to Faulkner Motors if she needed to.  Jim grabbed his travel mug, filled it up with coffee (black with sugar, as he usually made his coffee), and he left for work.

 

😊

 

Jim had yet another good day at Queen City Chevrolet.  He managed to sell three automobiles before he left work at four o’ clock.  Before he left work, he called Chelsea on her cell phone.  Jim said, “Chelsea, I am about to leave work and I am headed in your direction.”

“Sure, Dad.  I’ll be here when you show up.”

Jim left the dealership, and he drove to the Walgreen’s on South Boulevard where Chelsea was working.  Jim walked into the store.  He saw the manager.  The manager told Jim that Chelsea was in the back and would be out shortly.  Meanwhile, Jim walked around the store.  He picked up a small bag of potato chips, two small bottles of Snapple Tea (one for himself and the other for Chelsea), a case of Cokes, a car magazine and a roll of Certs.  At the checkout counter, there was a rack of toy cars.  Jim got a look at them.  There were so many, he had trouble deciding on which one he wanted to buy.  He finally decided on one, a red 1971 Camaro.  Jim thought he would put that one on his desk at Queen City Chevrolet.  After he paid for his purchases, he saw Chelsea walking toward him.  Jim asked Chelsea, “Are you ready to go to Faulkner Motors?”

Chelsea answered, “Yes, Dad.  About as ready as I can be.”

Jim and Chelsea got in his Impala.  Jim handed Chelsea her bottle of Snapple Tea.  He drove to Faulkner Motors on South Mint Street.  He drove past Queen City Chevrolet.  He saw Mark and Jonathan with people looking at cars.  Jim seemed quite pleased with that.  Jim wanted to wave at them, but he doubted they would see him.

Jim arrived at Faulkner Motors.  Right away, he saw Walter’s light blue 1967 Mustang and Renee’s dark blue late-model Mustang.  Both cars were parked on one side of the office.  There was a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade parked on the other side.  Jim figured that would probably be the one.  He was anxious to check it out. 

Jim parked in front of the office.  Walter and Renee quickly stepped out of the office.  They gave him a hug.  After Chelsea got out of Jim’s Impala, Walter and Renee gave her a hug.  Walter said, “Jim, I’m happy you and Chelsea are here.  There’s something I wish to show you.”

“Sure, Dad.  Let’s see the car.”

“Sure, Jim.  But first, I want to show you two what I am planning on doing to Faulkner Motors.”

“Sure, Dad.  Let’s see what you have in mind.”

Walter took Jim and Chelsea around the lot.  He said, “For starters, look at this parking lot.  It’s nothing but dirt and gravel.  And after it rains, it can get downright muddy.  That’s not good for the cars.  I do like them clean because clean ones can sell better.”

Jim looked around in every direction.  He said, “Yes, Dad.  I do agree.  That makes me glad the parking lot at Queen City Chevrolet is paved.”

“Yes, Jim.  And that brings me to another thing.  I’m planning on having this lot paved.  That’ll make it better for Faulkner Motors.”

“Dad, I would agree.  Having a paved lot just may keep your vehicles cleaner.”

“Yes, Jim.  That’s why I want the parking lot paved.  I talked to Kate, Renee, Jerry and Paulina.  They all agree with me.”

Jim continued to look around.  He got a look at the Charlotte skyline.  At the same time, he saw Renee showing Chelsea a dark gray Camaro with T-tops.  Chelsea told Jim that the Camaro she was looking at was a 1993 model.  But then, Jim realized something.  The car Renee was showing Chelsea was not a 1993 model.  It looked a lot newer.  Jim figured the model of the Camaro to be around 2001. 

Meanwhile, Jim and Walter continued their conversation.  Jim asked Walter, “When do you plan on having the lot paved?”

Walter answered, “I got some men coming next week to look at the lot.  If all goes well, I might be able to get it done around February or March.”

Jim said, “Okay, Dad.  I hope it all goes well.”

Then Walter said, “Jim, come in the office.  There’s something else I’m planning on doing that I’d like to show you.”

Walter took Jim into the office.  Walter showed Jim what appeared to be blueprints.  Walter spread the blueprints across the desk.  He said, “Jim, I want you to be one of the first to see this.  I am planning on rebuilding the office building.  I’ll also be adding a wheelchair ramp.  I’d like to make it more spacious, more comfortable for me, Renee, Paulina and the customers.”         

Jim looked at the blueprints.  He said, “Okay, Dad.  This was the office building and storage building Pam Gilmore used when she ran the place.  I remember that storage building quite well.  When I started out here washing cars, Paulina and I would take out red wagons filled with cleaning stuff.  I remember it all quite well.”

Walter said, “Yes, Jim.  I remember those wagons.  Renee, Paulina and I used them, too.  They still do.”

“I’m glad to see those wagons are still holding out after all those years.”

Then Walter said, “Jim, I did speak to Pam Gilmore a couple days ago.  She said she would go along with these plans.  Pam agreed the office building needed a lot of repairs.  She also said she was planning on paving the parking lot before she sold the used car lot”

Jim said, “Sure, Dad.  I’d be willing to go along with your plans as well.”

“The building will come first.  Some contractors were here a few days ago.  First, this office building will come down.  Your uncles will be here on Monday with a camper trailer.  That will serve as our office until the new one is built.  If all goes well, it could be completed in a few months.”

“Dad, that sounds good.  I cannot wait to see it when it’s all done.”

Then Walter showed Jim something else.  It was an artist’s drawing of what the office building would look like when completed.  Walter said, “Of course, I’ll put a couple drink machines in the front.  I’ll make the steps, porch and wheelchair ramp out of concrete.  That’ll make it stronger.  And I’m also thinking about putting some new lights in the front, and I’d like to put in another pole or two with security lights.”

“That sounds good.  More of those lights will be good for the car lot.”

Then Walter showed Jim another drawing.  He said, “This is what I’m hoping the inside will look like.  I’d like to put in another office or two.  I’ll still have this desk.  I am also thinking about adding a computer desk.  And look at that table with the stereo on it.  I’m also considering getting a new large flat-screen TV and having it mounted on the wall.  And on another wall, I’ll have a new larger pegboard to hold all the keys for all the cars.  And I also plan to have framed ads of cars on the walls.”

Jim said, “Okay, Dad.  I have a question.  What about the storage building?  Do you have any plans for that?”

Walter said, “Yes, Jim.  The storage building will stay where it’s at.  But I plan to fix it up some.  And I may get a ‘wet-dry’ vacuum cleaner.”

“Dad, that’ll be good.  Paulina and I tried to get Pam to get one.”

“Yeah, Jim.  I know.  Paulina told me that once.”

“Dad, it looks like you know what you want.  I think you got some good ideas for Faulkner Motors.”

Then, Walter took Jim outside.  He said, “Jim, there’s one more thing I wish to show you.”

“Sure, Dad.  What is it?”

Walter pointed to a building next door and said, “Jim, I will be buying that old gas station next door.  I am going to hire an auto mechanic, and he can work on cars, and help me and Renee and Paulina out as well.”

“That sounds great, Dad.  Have you got anyone in mind?”

“Maybe.  I’m thinking of Scout Gilmore.  I understand the lease on his gas station is up soon and it may not be renewed.”

“Whoa, Dad.  That’s the first I heard of that.”

Jim knew that when Luke Holbrook died of cancer in 2004, he left the gas station to Scout because Luke felt he was the best man for it.  The gas station had been on East Morehead Street near Bethany Street since about the early fifties.  Nothing was ever said about a lease.  That blew Jim’s mind.    

Walter said, “So far, the only four people who know about this are you, me, Renee and Paulina.”

“Okay, Dad.  I wish to find out more about this.  But for now, I’ll just keep this between us.”

“Okay, Jim.  I just hope we can get this thing off the ground soon.”

Then Walter pointed to the car, and he said, “Jim, there’s the car I want you to check out.  That silver Cadillac Escalade.  It’s a 2004 model.  We just got that car in.  Try it out.  If you don’t like it or it doesn't fit your needs, maybe you can try and find something better.”

Jim walked around the Cadillac Escalade while Walter went into the office to get the key and a dealer tag.  As soon as Walter returned, he put the dealer tag on the vehicle.  He handed Jim the key, and he said, “Jim, I got to go back in the office and make an important phone call.  Why don’t you take it out for a test drive?”

“Yes, Dad.  Sure.”

Jim looked in the direction where Chelsea and Renee were standing.  Renee was showing Chelsea a dark gray Camaro.  Jim shouted for Chelsea, and he told her to come to where he was standing.  Chelsea ran to Jim.  He said to her, “Chelsea, I’d like you to join me on a test drive.”

“Sure, Dad.  Is that the car?”

“Yes, Chelsea.  It is.”

Renee walked to where Jim and Chelsea were at.  She said, “I’d like to come along with you two, if that’s okay.”

Jim got a look inside the car.  As soon as he saw the inside, he was amazed by how spacious it was.  *Maybe this car will be good for our family*, Jim thought.  Renee said, “Believe it or not, this thing is very easy on gas.  The last owner took super good care of it.  Why don’t we try it out?”

Jim said, “Sure.  Maybe this is the car I need.”         

Renee said, “Okay, then.  Just let me tell Dad.”

Renee quickly went to the office to let Walter know that she would be joining Jim and Chelsea for the test drive.  She returned to the car just as quickly.

Jim drove the car out of the lot.  Renee sat in the back seat, and Chelsea rode shotgun.  Jim got Chelsea to try out the radio and the heating and air conditioning.  Renee had an idea.  “Jim, let’s go down South Mint Street, and then turn right on West Boulevard.”

Jim agreed with that.  He slowly passed Sydney’s Creations.  Chelsea saw Sydney’s red Camaro.  Chelsea rolled down the window, and she waved at Sydney.  Jim pulled into the parking lot.  He rolled down his window.  He told Sydney to go back in the parking lot so that she could see the Cadillac Escalade.  As soon as Sydney parked her Camaro, she walked to the Cadillac.  Renee got out, and she gave Sydney a hug.

Sydney looked at the Cadillac Escalade.  Renee said, “It’s a 2004 model and we got it just a couple days ago.”

Renee asked Sydney to get in and join them for the test drive.  Chelsea agreed to sit in the back seat with Renee, and Sydney would now ride shotgun.  Using her key fob, Sydney locked her Camaro, and Jim was back on the test drive.

Jim drove down South Mint Street to West Boulevard, where he made a right turn.  Just as Chelsea did when the test drive started, Sydney worked the controls on the radio, heater and air conditioner.  Sydney looked around the car, and she said, “Jim, this car is nice.  Is this going to be right for the family?”

“Yes, Sydney.  I feel it will be right for us.”

“Jim, there’s you and me and the five girls.  And what if we decide to have another baby or two?”

Jim thought about that.  He knew Chelsea would soon have her own car.  Lauren was already driving but did not have her own car.  That left Lindsay, Valerie and Caitlyn.  Jim had not yet asked Sydney to marry him.  But he soon would.  Jim knew that, sooner or later, that question would come up.  But for now, Sydney wouldn’t ask that question.  Another question nagged in the back of Jim’s mind.  *Could Sydney be right about wanting another baby, or maybe two?*  

Jim didn’t answer that question, at least for now.  He just continued driving the car.  Renee saw the look on Jim’s face, prompting her to ask him, “Jim, is there a possibility you could want this Cadillac Escalade?”

Jim took a deep breath, let it out slowly, and he said, “Yes, Renee.  Maybe Sydney’s right.”

Jim drove back to Faulkner Motors.  As he pulled into the lot, he made what would be his final decision on the car.  “Yes, Renee.  I believe I will go with the Cadillac Escalade.”

Renee said, “Jim, you sound like you’re very sure about your decision.”

Jim said, “Yes, Dad.  I am.  Sydney thinks it could be better for my family.”

Sydney said, “Jim, *our* family.”

Then Jim said, “And as for having another baby or two, we could think about that some.  But that will be further down the road.”

“Okay, Jim.  I think you and Sydney both made a good choice,” Renee said.

They all went back into the office.  After Jim filled out some paperwork and gave Walter a down payment, he was driving back to Bethany Street in a silver 2004 Cadillac Escalade. 

It was a large down payment.  From the insurance check from the minivan, Jim left out enough to get Sydney’s engagement ring.  What was left was for the down payment, insurance and a new license plate.  Jim felt it was all worth it.  In a matter of days, Jim would ask Sydney to marry him.

Jim dropped Sydney off at her office so that she could get her Camaro.  On the way home, Chelsea told Jim she had a car picked out.  It was a different car from the two she was looking at.  Chelsea said, “Dad, I’m thinking about getting that dark gray 2001 Camaro.”

Jim asked Chelsea, “What happened to the two cars you were looking at, the 1993 Camaro and the 1999 Chrysler?”

Chelsea said, “The 1993 Camaro had some holes in the seats that looked like they came from cigarettes, and it smelled like mold inside.  The Chrysler’s engine compartment looked very small.  Aunt Renee told me the battery was inside one of the wheel wells.  She also told me changing the battery would prove very difficult.”

Jim added, “And Scout told me once he tried to change the oil in a Chrysler Sebring.  He had to take off the manifold just to change the oil and the spark plugs.”

Chelsea said, “Aunt Renee suggested the 2001 Camaro to me.  After all she said about the car, I feel it would be a good choice.”

“Chelsea, if you want to go back and look at it some more, please let me know and I’ll be glad to take you back to Faulkner Motors.”

“Sure, Dad.  I’d like to go back sometime this weekend if that’s okay with you.”

“Sure, Chelsea.  We can do that.”

 

😊

 

Jim parked in his driveway.  Sydney was behind him.  Jim left the Escalade in the driveway while Sydney parked her Camaro in the garage next to Jim’s Impala.  It wasn’t long before nearly everyone on Bethany Street ran to the Faulkner house.  Mark and his family arrived first, followed by the Holbrook bunch.  Kendra was pushing a stroller carrying baby Ambrosia, with Mark and Kendra’s three daughters behind them.  Autumn and her family showed up next, along with Tim and Cara.  April Lynn was on her cell phone with someone.  No one knew who April Lynn was speaking to.  Then came Jake and Rebecca and their two daughters.  Sure enough, everyone showed up to check out Jim’s new SUV.  It seemed as though Jim Faulkner was about the most important person on Bethany Street on this cool October afternoon.  Svetlana had not left yet.  She was one of the first to see the Cadillac Escalade.  She said, “Jim, dear.  It looks like you made one good choice.”

Jim said, “Thanks, Svetlana.  I like it.  It has a lot of room.”

Audrey pulled into her driveway in her car, a Jaguar she bought at Faulkner Motors a few years ago.  Audrey tried to run to Jim’s driveway as fast as she could in high heels (she was also wearing a burgundy business suit).  As soon as Audrey looked at the SUV, she said, “Jim, I like this.  This is a good choice, especially with your family of five daughters.”

“Thanks, Audrey.  I feel I made a good choice.”

Autumn looked inside the SUV.  Rebecca and Jake were both impressed by Jim’s choice.  They all said pretty much the same thing.  While April Lynn was looking inside, Jim asked her, “April Lynn, who were you talking to on your cell phone?”

April Lynn answered, “I spoke to Russell and Scout Gilmore, and the Crabtree bunch.  I told them to come over and see your new vehicle.”

Sure enough, they did.  Autumn and Alex, along with Tim and his daughters, showed up to check out the Cadillac Escalade.  The Gilmore bunch showed up in Scout’s truck.  Russell, Paulina, Crystal and her kids, Amina and Cassie were riding in the bed of the truck.  Pam was riding with Scout in the cab.  Vince drove behind Scout in his El Camino.  He brought Nikki and Marissa with him.  Tia drove behind Vince in her 1965 Cadillac.  While they were checking out the SUV, Jonathan brought the Marlowe bunch in his classic Bronco.  Then, Simon showed up, bringing Ariel, Jodi and Charmaine with him.  Ariel was pushing a stroller carrying the twin girls, Kaci and Lucy.  Everyone seemed impressed by Jim’s choice.  Later in the evening, Kurt, Hannah, Summer and Jeremy showed up, bringing Randy and Lori Barrett with them.  They saw the SUV as well.  The others, including Jim’s mother and half-siblings (Emily and Charlie, along with Rachel and Jerry), Malachi and Stacy Holbrook and their kids, and Amy Courtland and her kids, would see Jim’s Escalade during the weekend.

 

😊

 

The weekend came and went.  Jim and his family rode around Charlotte some in the Escalade.  On Saturday, Chelsea finally bought her first car, that dark gray 2001 Camaro she was looking at.

On Sunday evening, Jim decided on something.  Using the idea he found in that magazine Simon gave him, Jim would use his die-cast car collection to pop the question to Sydney.

He would set that special moment for the second weekend in November.",0,1730031159.0,writers,1,0.5,False

1gd9i8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaminoDeSantiago/comments/1gd9i8t/debriefing_after_our_short_camino/,Debriefing after our short Camino.,"My wife and I are in our late 60's. We did the Sarria - Santiago leg between Oct 11 - 17. This was something I'd been wanting to do for 12 years but never had the time until now. By this time, age and medical issues had set in, so the short walk was the only option. No regrets. Loved every second of it, would do it again, not change a thing, but, pointless, as it's mission accomplished.

12 years ago, my 25 year loveless marriage to a terrible narcisstic child-woman had ended 5 years earlier. The 2 sons we had are my only living relatives. She had ended the marriage with an affair, and had believed her bitter boozehag relatives/coworkers/friends that a better life without me awaited her. When that life didn't materialize, as she drifted from one abusive man to another, she took it out on me by permanently alienating my sons from me with lies and accusations. That was why back in 2012, I wanted to walk the Camino Frances to put all that behind me and reboot my brain and life. Life got in the way, and and I finally found the time to go this month, with my wife of 2 years.

I walked with different reasons, as I had made peace with the events of 12 years ago. This walk was to embrace life and honour 8 people in my life who had passed away in the last 5 years, 3 from suicide, including my dad, and 5 from cancer.

I carried a symbolic talisman with me, and when atop the Magdalena Bridge, I knew that was the place to stop, reflect, cry, let it all go, and toss the talisman into the river from the bridge.

Continuing the walk, I felt better, lighter, released. What do you know. It does work.

They say you don't come to the Camino just for the walking. The Camino invites you to leave a part of ourselves behind, a part that was holding us back, and leave as a better version of ourselves. 

My wife and I carried full backpacks on our 7 day walk. It was disheartening and somewhat ""Why?"" to see much younger people with light or no daypacks, having their luggage transported hotel to hotel. Worse was certain others who were bussed stamp to stamp. We had stopped for coffee at Casa Calzada when a bus pulled into the parking lot and let out ""Pilgrims"". They entered the coffee shop, got their snacks and stamps, and walked 2 kms to the next town, where the same bus picked them up to shuttle them to the next stamp. In other legs, we would see groups who were still having breakfast when we left the hotel, join the trail 15 kms later,  3 kms from the next hotel, emerging from a side road where their bus had dropped them off. They would walk past us, energetic and refreshed. To each their own I guess. Pointless. Their credential is not earned. I feel guilty for having done the short route and not the entire Camino Frances, but age and health limited what we could do. Unlike these others half our age.

Anyway, it is what it is. My wife and I are proud of what we did and why we did it. Glad we did it, through rain and mud and sunshine. We met amazing people, each left something behind, celebrated with tears and champagne in front of the cathedral after the Galician piper piped us in. We attended mass. Explored the city, and have zero regrets.

Footnote, our shoes also made it to the Instagram video a lady from Baltimore was creating.

What are the qualities you looking for? Are you looking for someone who has perfected their skills, and/or has worked in specialty cafes? How do you view applicants who have recently done a coffee course, or state how many kg/bags they can handle (important or not)?

If you were to choose between two applications; both same levels of barista skills, however, one has customer service skills, whereas the other is bubblier and more outgoing, who would you choose?

Pour 70 gm of water into the grounds, then swirl & steep for a minute.

Finally pour the final 70 gms of water & cap it & let it rest for 90 secs. Flip the aeropress onto your collection device after that & rest for 90 secs again. After that slowly press the plunger so that it takes around 30-45 secs to collect everything.",2,1730030600.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

A friend and I travelled a short distance by train to spend a day off just enjoying an extended walk/light hike. The train commutes back and forth between two cities and we wanted to get out  before the final stop. We boarded, found adjacent seats and started our ride. The train started filling up after a few stops. At about half point of the journey, she went to the loo while I played with my phone, but not before placing her bag on her seat to make it clear it's reserved.

A minute or so later, next stop came, some dude our age must have boarded, taken a look around and seen me and my friend's seat. He came up, and without further ado went ""Move your stuff or I will"".

I was really taken aback, because who does that instead of asking ""Is this seat reserved?"" or something. I sadly didn't have a beautiful clapback and didn't call him out for his rudeness, I just said ""That's not my stuff. My friend will be back in a minute"".

He didn't even say anything, let alone apologise, just glared at me and remained standing up.

My friend came back, later I went to pee, and when I came back, she told me that our stop is in a few minutes. I saw the dude shift- obviously I can't know why, but I like to imagine he was preparing to take our seats after our imminent departure. That was when the pettiness arose in me and I asked my friend ""You know what, how about we start the hike a bit later and first go the remaining distance to the final stop, get a coffee and a Franzbrötchen?"". She said ""sure, why not, we have the whole day and it's a long time since I had a proper Franzbrötchen"". For clarification, that's a type of regional pastry traditionally made in Hamburg.

That's when I couldn't resist turning to look at the dude who now looked pretty furious, and I couldn't stop myself from laughing, which he obviously saw.

The Franzbrötchen were delicious and my friend laughed her ass off when I later told her how I got the idea of making the loop to Hamburg.",14,1730030538.0,pettyrevenge,3,1.0,False

He was always a good friend and has never shunned me or my family.

The conversation was very interesting.

We covered a lot of topics, particularly the UN involvement, which he of course denied.

He was actually dumfounded when I took him to the UN website for him to read it himself.

However the biggest reaction came from when I asked himbthe title of my new song.

I asked him the question ""Who told you that The Governing Body  is the Faithful and Discreet Slave?""

He paused...thought for a moment and his answer shocked me:

""THEY DID""

I, at this point made the sound of alarm bells and asked if this did not raise any.

He wants to meet up again.

Of the seven co-conspirators, the five that are in detention likely regret the murder. Frick and Frack briefly enjoyed their new motorbikes before they were caught. Katie will never raise her children. Charlie destroyed a life he loved for something he had no personal stake in. Donna is suffering in jail. 

Harvey will live out his final years without his wife or children. While it's increasingly remote, Harvey could even face arrest and trial for murder. This is a guy who probably imagined himself on cruise ships or surrounded by family.

That leaves Wendi. My guess is that Wendi, as she sips her coffee in her backyard this morning, still feels that, on balance, it was all worth it. She got rid of the man who had become her nemesis. She is raising her two sons to adulthood on her own. Wendi moved to Miami but has worked little, thanks to Dan's responsibly large insurance settlement. Wendi's nagging mother and pompous older brother are out of her way. She'll probably never again speak to either of them.

While it's no fun to testify repeatedly at trials and know that some consider her a murderer, Wendi can still live a life of relative normalcy. She is still listed as staff attorney for a prominent organization (https://abic.us/es/florida/). Going on 11 years since the murder, Wendi likely feels that District Attorneys Campbell/Cappleman don't have the evidence, or perhaps the drive, to indict her. Wendi might even take some satisfaction in the fact that she is one of the few who allegedly got away with murder in broad daylight.",3,1730030154.0,dan_markel_murder,0,0.8,False

I would like to improve coffee making process and make it better, faster and more simple.  
Currently I'm using Gaggia Classic Pro 2019 and Gaggia MDF set. I'm pretty happy with Gaggia Classic, but I don't really like working with Gaggia MDF. I'm using separate scale and I feel like I'm wasting a lot of coffee overall cause its hard to get exactly 18g from this grinder. Either I get 17g or 19/20g - and it gets pretty messy since the coffee sprinkles everywhere.

After doing some research, I’m considering two options:

1. **Upgrade to a Baratza Sette 270Wi** (\~$500) and continue using the Gaggia Classic Pro.
2. **Switch to the Sage Barista Touch Impress** (\~$1360) for an all-in-one setup that might make the process easier, faster, and less messy overall.

I mostly make cappuccinos, while my girlfriend enjoys espresso and Americanos. So, I'm trying to decide if it's worth spending more to save time or saving money and keeping more control over the shot-pulling process with a separate grinder.

How does quality of grinding/shots of Sage compare to Gaggia and Sette? Is it better or worse?

To give you a little bit of background, I have tried a omeprezole with no relief.  I have had sinus surgery, deviated septum surgery. I have had three instances over my lifetime where I had a scope, put down my throat and they found nothing.

I live in the Midwest and it’s allergy season. I am finding the key to controlling the acid and even allowing me to drink coffee is to control the amount of postnasal drip. I think all of that snot that is dripping down my throat is causing a lot of my problems. 

What I have found that provides me immense relief using the Netty pot and allergy meds. It’s especially crucial for me to use the Netty pot when I get up early in the morning to go to the bathroom because that’s when the histamines are the highest in the air.  I admit it’s not fun getting up and having to rinse your sinuses, but that really has helped control the nausea and the burning and also the insomnia that I will get early in the morning because of the histamines.  I also take an allergy pill early in the morning when I rinse my sinuses and also a mucus reducer. And then I have to use the Netty pot first thing in the morning. Also sleeping on a couple of pillows helps

1gd92fz,https://www.reddit.com/r/DiagnoseMe/comments/1gd92fz/daily_headaches_since_age_15_possible_causes/,Daily headaches since age 15 - possible causes?,"Hi everybody, here goes nothing. I'm 32, male, and have daily headaches since I was 15 years old. I've seen countless doctors about this over the years and haven't figured it out yet. Here are some details about my symptoms, medical history, and body:

\-Symptoms-

I have a headache every morning. I can't remember a morning in the past 17 years that I haven't had one. These headaches last for most of the day, but sometimes ebb depending on what I'm doing. As I sit here writing this, it feels like the back of my skull is burning, but at times it feels like it's at the center of my skull. (Headaches are so hard to ""place,"" but I can say I don't really feel the pain much on the front of my skull or face.)

What helps? Getting up and being physically active, especially outside in the sunlight, seems to make things better. If I go for a long bike ride in the sun and sweat for an hour, I'll feel great. Also, oddly, taking an edible (THC) or drinking alcohol (say, two glasses of wine) helps. I'm not a substance abuser or anything, and I try to avoid using THC or alcohol for pain relief unless I'm having a truly terrible headache day.

What makes it worse? If I sit inside and read with a coffee in the morning (as I was doing before this), I'll feel awful. If I lay down during the day and happen to doze off, a headache will come storming back hard. If I wake up to go pee at night, I'll have a splitting headache. I can't really do ""cat naps""--the headaches often make it hard to fall asleep--but I avoid them anyway because I know my headache will get worse, not better.

Oh, and one more thing: My headaches typically come with an odd taste in my mouth. Almost like I drank sour milk. It's not super intense, but it's so distinct. (And I'm not talking about ""dry mouth."")

As I said, these are daily and have been going on for most of my life at this point.

\-Medical History-

I don't have a super crazy medical history, but a few things seem noteworthy. When I was 12, I fractured my lower back (L4/L5) and had to get a pars repair surgery. There are a couple screws and a metal wire down there. I've had on-and-off light lower back pain since then, but I'm extremely active (weights, cycling, swimming, rock climbing), and exercise generally helps.

When I was in 21(ish), after dealing with a few years of constant athletic aches and pains, a doctor diagnosed me with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome--benign hypermobility type. I've never received a genetic test for this. He just used a few mobility tests, and I seemed to meet the criteria. I've never done much with this information beyond taking care, while exercising, to avoid hyper-extending. I've dealt on and off with elbow and shoulder pain, which sometimes expresses as pinky finger numbness, but again, smart exercise tends to help with that. (By contrast, it's worse when I'm at my desk working--I'm a lawyer.)

I recently had a CT scan, which found a benign mucous retention cyst in my sinuses. My sinus doctor couldn't tell how long it had been there and didn't seem to think it was a likely cause of my headaches. He's pretty reluctant to try to remove it (it's up there pretty far), until I've ruled out all other likely headache causes--which feels wise.

I recently had a blood test for my annual physical. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary, just some slightly sub-standard vitamin D levels, so I'm taking a daily OTC supplement for that. (No improvement on headaches from that, which I wasn't expecting anyway.)

Finally, I recently completed an at-home sleep study with Daybreak. (My neurologist, who I'm working with on the headaches, suggested a sleep study.) The study found that I fall just below the threshold for a sleep apnea diagnosis. I got four days of data, but just to give you a representative sample: One night I slept 8 hours and 20 minutes and had 21 ""apnea events."" One interesting finding from the study was that I appear to be getting less than the ideal amount of REM sleep. That night, for example, I got 1 hour and 12 minutes of REM (over the 8 hours and 20 minutes of total sleep).

\-My Body-

These details feel minor, but I don't know what's important. I'm white. I'm 5'11. I weigh 170 lbs. My body fat percentage hovers around 12-13% (and has for well over a decade). I wear glasses (nearsighted). Oh, and because I'm sure somebody will ask about mental health: I'm honestly really happy despite the headaches. They're a huge drain on me, but I'm so grateful for the life I have (job I love, amazing wife, our first child was just born last week). I get stressed like everybody else, but I've never considered myself anxious or depressed.

Im not sure what kind of dose options there are but i guess either volumetric or time based would be fine.

He was a skinny man but he could pack it away with the best of them. He also loved his drink to his own detriment. Dad was an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. On Friday nights dad and my uncle would go to the Prescott after work. If you’re from Ottawa then you know that place’s reputation. Anyway they would get their drink on and then would go someplace to eat. They usually went for Chinese as China town was just up the way from where they were. Their favourite restaurant was The Yeng Sheng on somerset. I still go there occasionally. Anyway the restaurant had 2 menus, one in English for the white people and the other one was in Cantonese on a black board. It was more traditional dishes that the locals would enjoy. Dad was really drunk and he wanted something off the black board. He was insistent even though the owner kept telling him he wouldn’t like it. Dad was very stubborn and the owner relented and dad got the aged fish. He ate about half of this dish and a few other things and took the left overs home. When I got up in the morning to feed the cows I could smell something really bad. I mean really bad. I thought something had died under the house or something. I made a coffee and when I went to fridge to get the cream I damn near fell over from the smell out of the fridge! I mean I’ve smelled some pretty foul things on the farm but this took the cake! When dad finally woke up I asked him what was that in the fridge he said left over Chinese and said I could eat it. I said are you crazy?! That’s when the smell hit him. He had no idea how strong this was the night before. Anyway the aged fish ended up on the burn pile (sorry yeng sheng) and he never ordered from the black board again.

1) Childish, because you're too much of an idealistic baby to understand reality. What, Harris isn't making Palestine the center of her campaign? I wonder why, when it's an election year and there are pro-Israeli conservatives foaming at the mouth to call her anti-Semitic? Is it fair to do that? No. Is it cold, calculated politics designed to win an election? Hell yes. Grow the fuck up and get used to it. There are things she doesn't get to say and doesn't get to do during an election year. 


2) Moronic, because you have absolutely no understanding of the consequences of your whiny protest vote. Has it occurred to you that if Trump gets into power again, he'll give Netanyahu a blank check to raze Gaza to the ground, settle the entire West Bank and start a war with Iran? Are you actually too much of a moron to recognise the difference between the strained, election-year tolerance that Biden/Harris have for Israel's conduct, and the callous Muslim-hating disregard for human life that Trump has? Are you genuinely too stupid to realise that voting for the lesser of two evils might actually put less evil in the world?


3) Hypocrite, because you don't actually give a damn. You pretend you are about Gazans, but really, you just like the feeling of being part of the ""resistance"". You think it makes you better than everyone else to stand on principle, and blindly follow your unrealistic black-and-white idealism. Oh cool, you're gonna protest vote for Jill fucking Stein? Congratulations on wasting your vote protesting the two party system, and proving how little you care about Palestinians by condemning their nation to a slow death under a Trump presidency. Does it make you feel big? Whilst the grown ups in the room make the difficult choices, grit their teeth through compromises, draft policy and negotiate deals at 3am with stale pizza and cold coffee, do you feel big standing outside with a placard screaming? Is it worth the end of the Palestinian state so you can ""send a message"" to the Democrats that they're not progressive enough?


Fuck you people. You are the reason Palestine will die. You, who don't understand the stakes. You, who choose to protest vote on principle and condemn Gazans to death in the process.

What should I do,"Okay, so. I (23F) went on a date with a guy (25M) I met through some common friends: we had been chatting online for a while and finally he asked me to see each other.

The date went well per se, he was very touchy and I reciprocated, but the conversation was very much small talk and unfortunately that is a bit of a turnoff for me. I know when you meet another person you're not supposed to talk about you greatest inspirations and fears, but we barely talked about ourselves (we briefly touched our studies and that was it, I still kown very little about his passions, his family or whatever) and for the most part I was the one asking questions.
Yes, there was a good banter/flirt going on, but that was about it.

This may be due to the fact that we went rock-climbing, so we were doing an activity and this wasn't your typical coffee date, but I assume one could still try to talk a little bit more.

Anyway, we arrive to the parking spot and I feel like I could've gone for a kiss (at least a peck on both cheeks, like we do in Spain) but I didn't. As a matter of fact, he didn't too, and I don't know if it was because he wasn't interested or what. On my part I know I panicked and kind run off (the more I like someone, the more I tend to ruin things) and now I kinda regret it.

He did write me a goodnight text (only because I've asked him to let me know when he srrived home) and I did too, but I feel like I've thrown away my good chance.
Should I write him again or does that seem like too much? At the same time I don't want to seem desperate, needy, or even childish, it's just that I got nervous.
I don't wanna blow it but I feel like he thinks I'm not interested.

TLDR: we went on a date and I didn't kiss him, even though I feel like he wouldn't have minded it. Should I reach out first even though I was the last one who messaged him?",2,1730028045.0,relationships,7,0.63,False

Without thinking, I replied, ""I'm fine."" The conversation moved on, but something nagged at me. Was I actually fine? What does ""fine"" even mean?

It hit me that ""fine"" had become my go-to response—a polite deflection that prevented any real discussion about how I was truly feeling. I started noticing how often others did the same. It was like we all silently agreed to keep things surface-level, avoiding any depth that might reveal vulnerability.

**The Culture of ""Fine""**

In a world that's more connected than ever, why do we feel so disconnected from genuine conversations about our well-being? The stigma around discussing mental health plays a big role. Admitting that we're stressed, anxious, or unhappy can feel like we're burdening others or exposing weakness.

**My Experiment with Honesty**

I decided to challenge this norm. For a week, every time someone asked how I was doing, I gave an honest answer:

* ""Actually, I've been feeling pretty overwhelmed at work.""
* ""I'm excited because I started a new hobby!""
* ""I've been a bit down lately, but I'm working through it.""

The reactions were surprising. Some people were taken aback, not expecting more than a ""fine."" Others opened up in return, sharing their own feelings and creating a deeper connection.

**What I Learned**

1. **Authenticity Invites Connection**: Being open encouraged others to share as well, leading to more meaningful interactions.
2. **It's Okay Not to Be Okay**: Acknowledging my feelings was liberating and helped reduce the internal pressure to appear perfect.
3. **Small Steps Break Stigmas**: Normalizing these conversations can make it easier for everyone to talk about mental health without fear of judgment.

**Why It Matters**

Mental health is just as important as physical health, but we often treat it like an afterthought. By perpetually saying we're ""fine,"" we may be neglecting issues that need attention. Open conversations can be the first step toward healing—not just for ourselves but for others who might be struggling in silence.

**Your Turn**

Have you ever caught yourself defaulting to ""I'm fine"" when you weren't? What happened when you decided to share your true feelings?

Let's start breaking down the barriers, one honest conversation at a time.",3,1730027625.0,mentalhealth,1,1.0,False

In the recent live, Alexandra claimed the wishlist was for their cats only. LIES. 

First of all, if YOU need a wishlist to help feed your cats, YOU definitely have too many cats. What is the count now, at least four adult cats in the house with an addition of the small orange kitten will be FIVE. 

Not to mention the several strays that still live outback. Most counties in Florida have laws about how many pets you can have that they may use to control animal hoarding situations. The Grifters will soon qualify for this as cars can reproduce as young as 4 months. 

Back to the Amazon Wishlist. The grifters are still butthurt that they were called out in the comments of a live YouTube video court of Cult Of Vintage. ( see second screen shot) 

The former viewer was on point with their opinions of chapter two. Almost every live sale was the opportunity to dry beg for SHEBA cat food, or presents for the kids, or white t shirts for Awkward Aaron, or CRAFT stamps for Alexandra. It was uncomfortable to watch. 
 
The grifters still have viewers that make THEMSELVES  feel better helping the grifters of Bushnell. They will enable the grifters on Noble  by buying cat food, coffee, craft stamps. The manipulation game of the Mccabes is on point. 

Back to the Amazon wish list. It was NEVER just for the cats. It was for the WHOLE family. Mrs. McCabe, stop with the lies. The unemployed grifters are just that, unemployed grifters that rely on the blind loyalty of their shrinking viewer base. ",2,1730027231.0,Chapter2VintageCo,0,1.0,False
1gd8jg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/1gd8jg3/i_just_cant_tidying/,I just can't (Tidying) ,"Update: I asked AI and am going to try something. I hope writing it here helps to stick to it. I combined a few suggestions to one. I will set a goal what I think I can do during one song and make a challenge out of getting this done. I'll keep making the goals bigger until I reach my limit. I feel I somehow need that positive kind of pressure to keep me going. 

(Not sure if this flair ist just for sharing resources and techniques, I'm looking for them regarding tidying/cleaning.)

My apartment is an absolute embarrassing mess to the point people don't want to visit anymore. It looks like about 10 bags of garbage and just as many suitcases of cardboard just randomly emptied out and thrown everywhere, all my things thrown through the apartment. 

As for diagnostic background I have CPTSD, PNES (psychological seizures), moderate depression, fibromyalgia, and suspected ADHD. 

I just don't manage to catch up with tidying the apartment. Not because I'm just too lazy and absolutely not because I wouldn't care. 

I lose the overview and just don't know where to start anymore. I don't have an eye for he process, I just know two states, tidy and messy. At least it helps a bit if I focus on a small area at a time. I have to touch every single item and ask myself where it belongs, if it's garbage or not etc. 

Then there are the two other problems I have no solution for. In combination it's like I don't have the time and energy to stay ahead of the mess. 

When I focus on a small area I'm really proud and feel good about it when I got it to look better, but it's back to the messy state before I can finish or even just start the next area and before I have the time and strength to continue. 

Then that problem with the energy. I would not even say it's a motivation problem. I'm highly motivated, envisioning what it'll be like when it's all nice and tidy again and I can't wait for the result and for working towards it. The problem is really everywhere in the process, getting started is hard and every single move is like running a marathon.

I literally feel like I'm about to faint from exhaustion after picking up garbage for like 5 minutes. I get lightheaded and need to sit down for a while. My HR and BP are fine though. I freeze a lot, for example before being able to pick something up, with the things in my hands, etc., sometimes I just stand there and stare for a few seconds up to two hours and it feels like seconds and I'm surprised where the time has gone. After these freezes I have to orientate myself again, I forget what I wanted to pick up or where I wanted to put it. I get a lot of psychological seizures from being overwhelmed and exhausted before starting, in-between, and afterwards.

If I manage to tidy for like 4 hours with about 2,5 of them being breaks I'm so mentally and physically exhausted that I sleep for up to 30 hours without being able to be woken up by an alarm clock just like after a long or severe seizure or episode of them or retraumatizing situations. Just those retraumatizing situations occur about 3 times a week where I'm knocked out for the day and at least the next, so I only have 1-2 days left where I could focus on the apartment for a few hours.

Just like today and yesterday I woke up early, I was so happy and motivated about having so much time to tidy my apartment. Then I'm just sitting there, maybe manage to do a study while sitting down and hour by hour goes by without me having the energy to get started. Coffee and music helped a bit today, I had a small energy boost, I looked at the first area and the items I wanted to tidy, I decided what I do with which item and then the exhaustion hit me like a truck again and I had to sit down, feeling like I was about to have a seizure or black out and also got a minor seizure which left me even closer to exhaustion and dissociation. 

Just writing this took me hour because I needed so many breaks, even if it was not comparable to tidying.

I deleted netflix and YT apps everywhere. I still have other video subscriptions but it's cheap and satisfying. No more than two.


I sample movies with trailers and TV shows to avoid investing myself in disappointment.


I use people apps to lead to a phone call or meeting. If there is no off screen outcome I give up.

She always has a thing to say about everything. She yells a lot in the house idk maybe it’s just the way she is, and I grew up always clashing with her personality. And the most toxic thing I’ve observed is that every time my Papa (66) tries to call her out in the calmest way possible, she gets mad right away. Like today, pumunta kami para mag grocery then I said something like “Minsan na nga lang tayo mag eat out ayaw mo pa treat ko naman eh”, kaso ayaw niya kasi may pagkain naman daw sa bahay and she goes on and keeps nagging about it while we were at the counter. Then my Papa just tried to call her out very calmy saying something like in bisaya “Sigeg yawyaw kadaghan og taw”. In tagalog “Wag kana mag ingay ang daming tao”. And then she went berserked and all mad because “bakit daw sya nanaman yung naging masama”. Bruh I just don’t get it why she’s always like this.

Mind you my Papa is the calmest man I’ve known in my life and he is also very nonchalant so I don’t get why he hates my Papa?? I try my best to make time for them, and spend time with them like going on cafes and treat them to coffee para may quality time naman silang dalawa. But she always finds something wrong about everything.

I really do love my Mama but I just hate having to deal every time she’s like this. And it’s just one of the reasons bakit ako bumukod and chose to live solo and independently. Because aside sa I have two more older siblings na walang trabaho at ambition sa buhay at naging dependent nalang sa kanila dun sa bahay, it just gets so messy in our dysfunctional house. 

Although I am very affectionate with both of my parents because I understand they aren’t getting any younger and I just want to spend quality time with them as much as possible.

1gd8dx1,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1gd8dx1/is_this_normal_im_so_scared/,is this normal? im so scared,"Hello! first of all sorry for this text wall but i need help, reassurance someone i can relate with because this has been the worst year of my life (male, 37) sometimes i feel like this is it, im going to pass out or worse, I've been feeling so miserable for the past 7 months. BTW my English is not good, apologies.  
  
**There's a TL;DR**  **you can read that one instead this massive text ahead.**  
  
i think i had graves for years or at least some sort of hyperthyroidism because i always have had weak, thin hair, i would lose so much hair, itchy sensation while doing any minor physical activity then the hand tremors and heat intolerance which got worse in 2022 and 2023 but other than that i wasn't worried i even thought it was just my ""nerves"" and stress and the weather.  
In 2019 a doc made ultrasound to check an enlarged lymph node due viral infection, everything was normal but he pointed out that thyroid looked enlarged, the Oncologist said there was nothing to be worried about and i was totally fine, he even said that if i was anxious i could visit him whenever i wanted free of charge (i guess he thought i was extremely nervous to say such thing).  
  
Ok present day... back in late march (2024) i felt this weird spasm in my chest, i thought it was some random muscle spasm but next days it got more intense and frequent and turns out it was my heart.... **i started having PVCs** and i was so terrified i thought i was going to die, the feeling is absolutely dreadful.

why me? why this horrible thing started happening randomly without notice, one day my heart was feeling normal i didn't care about it then next day starts doing this fluttering this extra beat that felt like *""bump, bump, bump,,,,* ***BUUMP****, bump, bump"".*

I went to GP he said i shouldn't worry about the palpitations, told me to relax and get tea and valeriana, he didn't seem bothered by the fact that i smoke (2-3 a day) and drink lots of coffee and have a terrible diet, just fast food, no veggies no fruits whatsoever only junk but He just wanted me to relax and get blood work done.  
  
Lab results came showing everything within range, sugar, cholesterol, hematic biometry, urine etc except the thyroid, TSH was 6.05, then T3 free was 5.00, T3 total 122.00, T4 free 1.96 and T4 total 13.00.

GP said he wouldn't prescribe anything with such numbers, that most of my issues were due anxiety and he wouldn't refer to endocrinologist or anything, he wasn't worry at all, he gave me propanolol for the panic attacks and the day i took the lowest dose i felt i was going to faint, it was terrible, HR went down to 65-70 (i was used to having 80-90) and the PVC's stopped for a while but i literally thought i was going to pass out and had to lay down, i tried one more time days later and within few hours i was feeling lightheaded, disorientated but a warm shower helped me to relax and get some sleep, from that day i said *""im not taking propanolol again*, *hell no""...* For the record it was just 10mg the first time and 5mg second time i tried.

I wasn't convinced by this diagnostic, **i went to Cardiologist** i just wanted those horrible PVC's to go away, the cardiologist wasn't bothered at all he did the usual thing, check blood pressure in both arms, heart rate, ECG and stethoscope in my chest, lungs and back while holding my breath etc. He didn't give me any medicine or treatment or advice just told me go to endocrinologist else he wouldn't prescribe anything, he didn't say anything about my reaction with propanolol so yeah imo terrible doctor. His diagnosis was sinus tachycardia and hyperthyroidism as probable cause (i was so nervous and shaking that raised my HR in doc office).

May 2024 i finally visited endocrinologist, for some reason they are extremely busy took weeks to get an appointment, he just saw the way i was talking and my mannerisms and said *""yeah, you have hyper no doubt""*  He wanted new blood test because having high tsh and high t3,t4 means an issue with pituitary gland which is very rare, anyways he gave me **Methimazole** 5mg twice a day for 4 weeks then more lab tests.

**This is where i probably screwed up...** 

Methimazole made me feel better no doubt, i wasn't feeling hot, the hand tremors got better, no more itchy skin actually i was feeling more fresh, colder, i could sleep like a baby, no insomnia etc.   
The PVC's didn't go away but i had fewer, less intense and less scary so i thought this is it, maybe in some weeks or few months i'll start feeling better again and the pvc will go away someday.

But that didn't happen...

I couldn't visit endocrinologist he was full with patients for weeks also i couldn't have blood test done in time due money issues but i didn't stop the treatment... i took 10mg each day for 6 and a half weeks.  
  
Then one day in late June while enjoying a movie in my computer i started feeling a bit ""lightheaded"" but nothing serious.   
Next days that feeling was a bit more intense and i can only describe it as **feeling ""weaker, lightheaded, confused, a mild disorientation, having fatigue and even dizzy""** but visually nothing was moving or spinning it was like feeling like floating or when you drink a couple of beers without the nice feeling of drinking alcohol.

So i assumed it was the methimazole, i lowered the dose to just 5mg for some days but i wasn't feeling better, so went from 5mg to 2.5mg daily. The 5th of July i was doing house chores and i felt i was going to pass out so i went to bed to watch a movie and relax, i was feeling Ok like 2 hours later. This was almost the same feeling i had when i took Propanolol.

I stopped taking Methimazole for 16 days... and i was started feeling back to normal except for the pvcs.

i talked to endocrinologist, he said that NONE of those symptoms indicate anything relevant, that it was my body getting used to new hormone levels and i should resume treatment with at least 5mg for a month then have blood test done to check the liver response to methimazole etc.  
  
So i did it, actually i started with just 5mg for 4 days then 2.5mg until July 29th and the lightheaded feeling, the weakness and confusion came back and i stopped immediately

August 2024 was one of the worst months in my life...

August 5h... the lightheaded, dizziness, weakness and confusion got much worse, i thought i was going to pass out or worse, i called my family and they spent the night with me, i couldn't walk without feeling that i was going to faint, i got better next day but we went to ER and guess what? they said it was anxiety and panic attack, my BP and Heart rate was bit high but nothing unusual and surprise surprise my body wasn't feeling that terrible in the ER i was sent home and doc told me to take electrolyte drinks that it and follow endocrinologist advice.  
  
Four days later i started taking vitamins and eating a big banana a day, i stopped vitamins months ago and last time i ate banana was like 2 years ago. 

The PVC palpitations happened a lot less a month after i started taking vitamins and banana and orange juice, in September i barely had 2 or 3 a day and for some days i couldn't feel any PVC at all. this made me so happy maybe a potassium deficiency triggered the pvcs, no idea but i would eat banana every other day and take my vitamins to avoid those damn pvcs.

Sadly the lightheaded, weakness sensation and fatigue and disorientation wouldn't go away, some days it was better some other days worse, like a yo-yo but overall i was feeling better, slowly a bit better everyday Then i got my blood tests done in Sept 11th and 3 days later i started feeling like !""#@ again, like i was going to pass out, weak etc... i got better next day after sleeping all day and doing bare minimum activities like cooking, shower etc.

**Lab Results September 11th**

TSH = 0.005  
T4 total =13.26  
T4 free  = 2.27  
T3 total =1.91  
T3 free = 5.68

anti tsh TRab antibody test = 3.1 

So judging by the TSH number it wasn't the pituitary gland, it was actually Graves disease...

Went to GP again because one night i had acid reflux and this feeling of something in my chest between rib cage and the stomach, like a feeling of bloating of fullness or even like ""tension"". No pain whatsoever.  
  
What did i do? google my symptoms and big mistake, i read about heart failure, what if this was related to my pvcs?  so i couldn't sleep at all so i visited the doc early in the morning. Endo's are not available, they are all busy.  
  
The GP he saw new blood tests and repeated the same !""#@ thing he said months ago, that it was all in my head, my anxiety my nerves, that these numbers are not worth having methimazole, that i should stop taking that med at once and i told him *""i did it like a month and a half ago because i started feeling like i was going to pass out, so weak, so lightheaded etc""*   
  
He said *""that's your anxiety talking making you feel like that, period and the reflux is caused by your thyroid condition yet not worth taking the meds the endo gave you, go talk to him if you like but again this is your anxiety, take tea, relax etc"".*

acid reflux is something that is very rare for me and he gave me this look like i was a paranoid obsessive person (whcih i am btw) and said that i was young and healthy.

**October 2024**

Some days my HR can reach 85-95 while doing chores, nothing unusual, actually i always had this HR, methimazole lowered HR to 70-80 and while resting it would go to 60-65 but it's obvious that HR was increasing again. My resting HR is 65-75.

Since august i had like 4-5 panic attacks, HR would go up to 110-120 because i thought i was having problems breathing but different pulsimeters said otherwise that i had 96-98 oxygen.

The lightheaded feeling, confusion, disorientation, fatigue, weakness comes and goes, some days i feel much better some other days i have a relapse but overall i thought i was finally starting to recover from this situation until 4 days ago...

For 3 days i was bloated, maybe it was the cheese? the beans? i always eat that so this was rare, actually something similar happened in august but lasted couple of days... weird thing, i didn't feel lightheaded or at least not like i used to.

i was Feeling bloated, i try to burp but its difficult i can't do it easily i have this urge to burp but i can't do it and when i  finally burp it feels good, i have to take soda to force burping.  
i have this feeling in my chest something is ""tense"" between rig cage and stomach, i have the urge to force coughing cuz i feel like there's something stuck in my upper stomach or something. Again, No pain at all.

for a couple of years (since late 2022) i had this sharp pain in the back of my head and right upper back close to right shoulder, its like a pinched nerve pain, it suddenly happens, its not something frequent maybe it can happen twice a day or some days i wouldn't feel anything anyways.... i asked google about my symptoms and guess what? yeah, heart failure or cancer or both... so i didn't sleep again i was shaking and having this feeling of impending doom.

I spent 12h a day in the computer, bad posture, terrible mattress, terrible pillows so i always thought that was the cause for the sharp, nerve pain in the skull and my back.

**Today it wasn't better, i finished daily chores, came back to pc for some gaming and at 9pm i went to bed to relax and watch a movie with my phone, again i had the feeling of something stuck in my upper stomach but i wasn't feeling bloated this time.**

**one hour later i was relaxed but out of nowhere i started feeling like i wasn't breathing ok, anxiety kicked in and it was more like feeling that my lungs wanted to stop working or my heart, more than having difficulty breathing so i freaked out, left my bed, HR went to 105 i drank some water went back to bed this time laying on my side not on my back and again i went google and same story... heart issues if you having difficulty breathing while laying flat on your back so again HR went up, anxiety, panic etc.**

Since august every time i have a minor discomfort in my shoulders or arms or the chest or barely noticeable pain i immediately think ""its my heart... something is not ok"".  
back in 2022 and 2021 i had pain in my chest and i suspected it was due terrible posture and mattress and it was costochondritis, some stretching made everything better but now i cant stop thinking that any pain in my chest is heart related.

it's been 4 hours since that, now im here writing all this massive text wall, i started feeling lightheaded again, had this pressure in my head but that always happened since i stopped the meds in late July. its like sinus pressure or positional pressure idk how to describe it other than that....

I dont feel the ""thing"" in my stomach anymore, i font feel bloated, i dont feel like im not breathing ok, i actually feeling better and im even talking to some friends with voice chat etc playing some games...

What the heck is going on? this is a living nightmare this is hell.

Endo appointment till december 2, cardiologist until november 9th... i almost left my room and called family to go ER again but now im feeling totally fine and while writing this paragraph... lightheaded feeling is GONE not that im complaining but 4 hours ago i was praying to god to help me and certainly he did coz i feel better.  


**TL;DR**

Is this normal?  
**Feeling lightheaded, confused, with disorientation, weak, fatigue, mental confusion to the point i think im going to pass out.**  
  
i took methimazole for 6 weeks, (10mg daily) then stopped for 15 days due lightheaded etc symptoms then started again with much lower dose then all the terrible symptoms came back so i stopped again and its been 3 months since my last dose but i still don't feel better, this lightheaded feeling this weakness and confusion wont go away, some days i feel better then i have relapse and feel terrible again and tbh sometimes i feel like im going to pass out or worse like stop breathing or my heart failing.  
  
TBH i was feeling MUCH BETTER in April and May when i had the PVCs with no medication whatsoever, yes, it was scary it was terrible but at least i didn't feel like i was dying or going to pass out, so weak so fragile and confuse all the time, cant be coincidence that all this started after taking methimazole.

what if i reached Hypo stage in late july? my TSH is so low, my T4, and T3 slightly above normal but i bet those were much lower during august when i finally stopped taking the medicine. Apparently i've been living with this condition for years and endo said it's normal to feel bad cuz my body is not used to work with normal levels... i don't know what to believe anymore, ill visit another endocrinologist and cardiologist soon enough. Thx in advance for all replies and advice.

Symptoms before taking methimazole: Heat intolerance, itchy skin, hand tremors, insomnia, tinnitus, ectopics, pvcs, HR from 80 to 90, sometimes 100-105 or 115-120 during panic attacks, Winter was a blessing, Summer a living nightmare. Resting heart would be 70-80.

Symptoms that made me stop taking methimazole: Lightheaded, confusion, disorientation, fatigue, weakness, feeling that i was going to pass out, a feeling of ""pressure"" in the face, sinus or head (no pain) it would go away by resting my head. All i wanted was to stay in bed that was the only place where i could feel fine. Sometimes i felt my heart was beating slow (60-65-70 bpm) and with low pressure which gave me a panic attack at least once. Also sometimes feeling like it was difficult to breathe, then like i had something stuck in my throat that made me force coughing (maybe thyroid doing it's thing?)  
  
Recently, in the past 5-6 days: feeling bloated, can't burp easily, feeling like there's something between my rib cage and stomach, like something is ""tense"" but there's No pain.  
Sometimes the urge to cough due feeling like im not breathing in a proper way or feeling something in my throat and upper stomach.",1,1730026590.0,gravesdisease,1,1.0,False

After listening with all of your suggestions, I did some experiments with grind size and recipe, after a lot trial and error, I finally found recipe which hit the spot and suitable for fine grind size with less drawdown time. 

Recipe:  300 ml water with 20gm coffee. 16 clicks with C2.  
1st pour : 60gm of water, wait for bloom for 45 sec. A gentle swirl with spoon instead of swirling like maniac.
2nd pour:  120 gm water,  wait for another 45 sec or complete drawdown of pour, which ever is earlier. (1:30) 
3rd pour : remaining 120 gm of water. (2:15).

Benefits: for me, drawdown time reduced. 
Found nice mixture of bitter and sourness. Fruity notes were dominant as a aftertaste.

We met in first year in university though an extra curricular project. We worked together on that but all our meet-ups were about the project. We ended up abandoning the project and kinda drifted apart,  met up for coffees sometime and talked during class but nothing more. 

Anyway towards the end of this university year (April/May) we became way closer meeting up weekly, doing activities, helping her view apartments. And then over summer we went on two holidays together (just us two) which were a lot of fun. Jane love holidays and we always plan these crazy adventures. We still meet up regularly, like every week, she cooks me meals and we go hiking. And she keeps talking about our holidays and trying to invite me on any trip she going on (even with her parents). We share a lot of similarities, she finds me really funny and we can talk together non stop for hours.

At a party a week ago Jane left early and her best college friend, who I never met, was asking where she went. She told me she’s heard a lot about me and asked if I like Jane as more than a friend. I said I did. I think Jane may be seeing someone, I’m not sure, but the only reason I could think her friend would ask this is because Jane likes me. 

We’ve never kissed or anything, we do flirt sometimes but I’m not the most emotional person. I really do like Jane and would love to ask her out but don’t know her stance and don’t want to ruin our friendship. 

Next time we meet. I was thinking of flirting and joking that she got her friend to ask me and then tell Jane that I do like her. Any advice is welcome. ",1,1730026321.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Well extraction took 15 seconds, dentist didn't said a word about post pull care and said I do not need ATBS, so in span of 5 mins I was shorter of 180$ and went home......

  


D0: Ate some yoghurts (had no idea milk is nono) main dinner: Pho bo, Zero swelling and very mild pain in extraction area, nasty taste in mouth, light bleeding also for first 6 hours I was nonstop spitting that blood because I had no idea you are not supposed to......

  


D1: woke up drenched maybe I had short term fewever, again Yoghurts and Pho Ga as main dinner, nasty taste in mouth, light bleeding

  


D2: Yoghurts and Pho bo as main dinner, extreme headache from Coffee abstinence and Nicotine Abstinence, started light vaping around 30 Puffs at most (DL Vape, little pressure/resistance ) and took one ibalgin, nasty taste in mouth

  


D3: Decided to finally brush teeth and tongue since my mouth was fking sewage, went full retard mode and Vaped for most of the day, still Stick to the Pho Bo and yoghurts

  


D4:Started eating normal but just to be safe I went for Mashed potatoes and Salmon, + coffee FK YEA

  


D5: same, so far it's looking good with occasiona mild pain in extraction area usually when walking

  


D0,D1,D2 I was incredibly tired and worked most of my time from Bed and slept like for 11 hours/day... Also I was trying to check how my socket looks like but all I could see was single tiny hole rest was blocked by my 7th tooth...... Althrough so far it looks good, If you can I would advise you to abstain from Smoking/vaping however I LOVE Nicotine and I couldn't be longer without her. Worth mentioning is I was taking 2g of Vitamin C spread through the days for 2 weeks There's a lot of plausible evidence that vitamin C can greatly improve post extraction healing, and plays major role in Collagen production.





I also tried Nose vapping for first 2 days :D but It's not possible with my DL cloud machine (Uwell crown 5)

 (because of my masters and visa) most of the days I stay in my bed and it's really hard out and socialize and I think that I'm of 0 worth and k**ling myself but i don't have guts for that, so I end up doing self harm.

They have two children (my sister and I, 30-something F, 40F) and two grandchildren 5 and under, from my sister. We all live within about 1/2 hour from eachother and see one another at least weekly, for a coffee or dinner, etc. My sister and I get on well with our parents and the parents dote on their beautiful grand children. 

Outwardly, my parents have a nice life. Money. Property. Vehicles. Stability. They're retired, with no financial worries - but they seem really, really unhappy. 

My dad has lost a lot of hearing, but denies it outright, and seems to speak less and less now days, his only real interest is rolling 24/7 GB news. I grasp from the rhetoric that it is like FOX news in America, eg. generally not trusted as a reliable news source and right-leaning. He doesn't have any drive to do anything off his own back, will always ask my mum what they should do and it's up to her to make suggestions. He doesn't have his own friends (hey have 'joint' friends, eg. couples, but my mum is the sociable one). He can't cook anything alone so depends on my mum to cater for him. Everything seems like a chore to him. If we suggest something he'll pull a face, or huff and puff about it, etc. He can only see the problems with anything.

They don't share a bed or a room. 

My mum has expressed to us, my sister and I, that she's unhappy. She said when our dad retired her life was 'over' as she previously had her own lifestyle while he worked 5 days a week. She doesn't want to live in this part of the country - she misses where they lived before, but he won't budge. She loathes having to cook every day. She doesn't want to look after him all the time - wishes he would just go out and do something under his own steam. She feels like they just sit at home all the time and don't do anything. She's clearly frustrated and...maybe angry? 

I wonder if they would be happier separated? But I don't want to voice it into reality, in case it is planting a seed. 

I am trying to encourage her to do stuff on her own. She has a handful of retired F friends who I have suggested planning a get-away with...but she also seems hesitant. 

I appreciate, after 50 years together, maybe it is normal to feel frustrated and irritated by the other person (god knows, I can't bear other people for long!) - I guess I am just not used to being in the position where I am advising THEM on things. I can't tell if this is normal relationship issues or somethign that really needs to change. 

Context: My dad is \_probably\_ autistic and has inattentive ADHD (hasn't ever had a screening but these are obvious issues). I am diagnosed with both, and my sister is in the process of getting an ADHD screening, although doesn't seem to be on the spectrum. My mother is neurotypical, as far as we can tell. Both have issues with their temper. 

Any advice? I don't know how involved to get or what to suggest...

  
TLDR; my aging parents seem really unhappy, despite having much of the trappings of a 'happy life'. I don't know what to suggest to make the sitation better, whether that is calling time on their relationship, or suggesting more activities apart, etc. I think they're both very bored and are becoming more distant from eachother.

That moment when your checking account laughs at you.

When unexpected bills hit harder than a heavyweight champion.

When you're stuck between a rock and an empty wallet.

# The Real Deal About CashMax

Here's the thing about emergency cash - you need it fast, and you need it without the usual bank hassle.

According to recent studies, 63% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck. That's wild.

And get this - the average emergency expense that crushes most people? $2,000.

That's where CashMax steps in.

# What Makes CashMax Different?

# Speed That'll Blow Your Mind

Most traditional loans? They'll have you waiting for days.

CashMax? **15 minutes**.

That's right. While you're waiting for your coffee to cool down, they could approve your loan.

# The Cash You Actually Need

None of that small change nonsense.

**We're talking:**

* Minimum: $1,000
* Maximum: $15,000

**And it all depends on two things:**

* What your ride is worth
* How much you're bringing in

# Getting Your Hands on the Cash

# What You'll Need

**Keep it simple. Just bring:**

* Your car's title (clean and in your name)
* Proof you're making money (recent pay stubs work great)
* Government ID (valid, with your photo)
* A vehicle with equity (meaning it's worth something)

# The Process

1. Walk in with your documents
2. Get your car checked out
3. Sign some papers
4. Walk out with cash

*According to industry data, 85% of title loan applicants get approved when they have all required documents.*

# The Real Talk Section

# The Good Stuff

Listen, there's a reason why CashMax holds a solid **5.0 out of 5** rating on Yelp.

**People love:**

* That lightning-fast approval
* Staff that actually gives a damn
* Keeping their car while paying back the loan
* Clear communication (mostly)

# The Not-So-Good Stuff

**Let's keep it 100:**

* Interest rates? They're higher than traditional loans
* Some folks struggle with repayment terms
* A few people mentioned hidden fees
* Customer service can be hit or miss

# Smart Moves When Getting a Title Loan

Want to play it smart? Here's how:

1. **Read Everything**

* Every single word
* Even the boring stuff
* Especially the boring stuff

1. **Ask These Questions**

* What's the total payback amount?
* Are there any hidden fees?
* What happens if I'm late?
* Can I pay it off early?

1. **Plan Your Exit**

* Know exactly how you'll pay it back
* Have a backup plan
* Consider your next paycheck

# Bottom Line

CashMax Title & Loan Services isn't for everyone.

But when you need cash quick, and traditional banks are giving you the cold shoulder?

It's an option worth considering.

Just remember - this is a short-term solution, not a long-term financial strategy.

And according to financial experts, about 78% of title loan borrowers successfully repay their loans when they have a solid repayment plan in place.

The key? Go in with your eyes wide open.

Know what you're getting into.

And most importantly, have a solid plan to get out.",1,1730024709.0,cliobra,0,1.0,False

Solid haha kapag trip lang ako nag bblend ng coffee beans ko especially kapag leftovers na. Sometimes it works sometimes it does not pero kapag nakuha mo yung tamang timpla masarap sa pakiramdam syempre sa panlasa din. How about you guys ano mga coffee blends nyo na na try nyo gawin share them bellow 👇",15,1730024371.0,CoffeePH,0,0.95,False

","Hi r/espresso! I've had this hardware for years, but I have only really drank espresso in milk drinks. I'm now interested in trying to make good shots of espresso to drink plain, finding and trying good specialty coffee beans, improving the milk drinks I already make, etc., and I've watched a number of videos to try to figure out what I need most to make this a viable (but still affordable) hobby at home.

My question here is pretty much all in the title. Obviously, my machine is on the lower end, though I have fitted the portafilter with a non-pressurized basket - still, I'm sure the DeLonghi is **a** bottleneck. I'm also aware that my grinder's adjustments are too large to dial in a roast, and I'm also led to believe the conical burr could make it difficult to appreciate the separate flavors in a given roast profile compared to a flat burr.^(1)

With all of that in mind, is it more of a priority to upgrade my espresso machine to something in the $500-$1000(+) range, to upgrade my Sette 30 adjustment assembly to the [270's](https://www.amazon.com/Baratza-Sette-Adjustment-Assembly-UPGRADE/dp/B09NRZNJ4Q), or to upgrade to a \~$500 flat burr entirely? Assuming I eventually upgrade the machine as well as upgrade/buy a grinder, what should my priority be, and within or without those budgets do you have recommendations for my situation?

My preference would be no modding if it adds a lot more cost or voids the warranty; i.e., for an espresso machine upgrade, getting a consistent 9 bars out of the gate so that I don't ever have to worry about that would be ideal.

Thank you!

^(1. Though at the same time, that conical is decent with dark roasts, which has been my filter-coffee preference; I have no idea what kind of roasts for espresso I would like, nor how I could find out besides working within my own setup, but that's a separate question altogether :\))",2,1730024331.0,espresso,1,1.0,False
