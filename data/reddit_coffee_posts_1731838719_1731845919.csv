1gtc3f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1gtc3f2/aio_a_new_friend_i_made_seems_to_be_a_bit/,AIO a new friend I made seems to be a bit obsessed with me? ,"So, bit of context, I 25f live in a very rural, secluded countryside community without many people. I've got ADHD and had to care for my mum during her cancer treatment and have found it quite hard since leaving school to hold onto friends. 

I can be a very sensitive and emotional person, and often get sad I don't have more friends. Lots of things in the world feel unfair to me and make me upset in a way most people don't seem to think about. Basically, I'm a bit weird and don't quite fit in with my peer group and I'm okay with this. 

But basically I decided to volunteer at a local youth charity to help young people with mental health problems and made friends with another girl in the training sessions last year. She was very quiet and sweet, has a disability she lives with and a cute service dog I liked to interact with. I would make her tea during the breaks as I knew she struggled with mobility. Anyway I was quite down at this time and felt like it was the perfect opportunity to make friends with someone who is more sensitive and aware of that stuff.

This is where it gets a bit strange. I know most girls will generally be very friendly via message and send X's, but this girl seems very VERY friendly and after only seeing her twice outisde of the training she was messaging me daily saying ""I really really miss you so much xxxxxx"" ""can we hang out soon again little (dogs name) misses her Baba xxxxx"". Which again I don't mind, like this is the exact thing I've always said I want, like a good best friend, but it got to a point when I went to meet her for a coffee and she basically insisted I come to her house and then wouldn't let me leave and was really upset at the idea of me leaving and it made me feel really uncomfortable about not being able to choose to do what I want essentially. I hate making people feel bad but I'm also very polite so can be hard to be upfront sometimes. 

I kindof didn't reply to her after this and then I saw it was her birthday recently so it's made me feel bad and maybe like I was overreacting. So I said happy birthday and she messaged me again saying how much she ""misses me so so much"" even though I only spent maybe 5 hours with her on 2 occasions. 

Basically, is this normal? Am I being obnoxious and not taking the chance to have a friend because I think she's being overly attached or demanding but isn't?

1) Can you take a pg or a flat for a short period of time?(4-6 months)
2) Approximate cost and safety 
3) is it worth it?
4) Where to actually go if you want to look for a place to stay.

We got our 9 week old puppy yesterday. She's a real sweetie! She did well overnight.. And then this morning she woke up super hyper and hungry. She is wanting attention nonstop. I played with her for a bit to get out some of that energy and gave her food which she gobbled up immediately. I played a bit more with her and made a coffee and sat down.

She immediately whimpers and tries to jump and scratch toward the couch (which I don't want her to jump). So I sit at the dining table with my coffee and again she tries jumping at me. So all my attention there again. Not wanting her to jump on me.

My hubby came down to relive me and was holding down her leash with his foot so she doesn't walk toward me but now it feels like she's being punished for just trying to walk toward me and that feels wrong. I know I can't train too much at once. I just hate dogs jumping up on me.

Please help with any tips, tricks, advice or maybe a morning routine I could try. Maybe she needs to go for a walk and then I settle in and have a coffee and breakfast?

Will I ever have coffee again? Lol. Reminds me of having kids and how my coffee would always go cold",1,1731844565.0,corgi,0,1.0,False

We're both 25 now. Four months ago, when I graduated, I hit a crisis and suddenly started recalling our entire relationship and the mistakes I made. The problem is, we've already had many conversations and reached conclusions about every situation, but I can't forgive myself, and I can't plan a future with him in this state. I cry every day and feel overwhelming sadness.

The first thing that bothers me is the drama I caused. In the last two years, there haven't been many, maybe 10 arguments a year. The drama happened over a six-month period when I was struggling with a very difficult subject at university, and I wasn't doing well. Once, I even tore up an entire notebook. I constantly dragged him into my university struggles when I should have kept that separate. After that subject, it continued through the summer; I failed another subject and had to retake it. When I failed, I was so angry that I told him to cancel our vacation. I wanted everything to fall apart for him too because I was miserable. That lasted one day. We were both at our hometowns, and I would frequently start drama through messages. He was working all day for an american company as an engineering manager, and I would bombard him with messages, often writing illogical things. I was very childish. When he said he couldn‚Äôt come for the weekend, I would write, ‚ÄúFine, then don‚Äôt come at all.‚Äù A few times, I wrote, ‚ÄúGo to hell and die.‚Äù All of this happened during that six-month period. It didn‚Äôt happen afterward, nor was it happening before that.

The next thing that bothers me is not telling him private things. We never had deep conversations about the past, and that‚Äôs what held me back from agreeing to a relationship in the beginning. At home, we live in a very small apartment, 37m2, and I share a room with my brother. I was ashamed of that and never told him. I didn‚Äôt open up about my problems at all. We didn‚Äôt have much money before; elementary school was hard for me because I have alopecia and no hair, my brother was unemployed for a long time, and some little things. These are all things we never talked about, and I regret not opening up sooner. When I told him about my hair before the relationship, he never asked me anything about it. He said he doesn‚Äôt like putting people in awkward situations and that the past doesn‚Äôt matter to him, so he didn‚Äôt think to ask. When I finally told him all those things, he said he had nothing to say.

The next thing that bothers me is the beginning of our relationship. We met on October 25th and saw each other one more time before I went home for two weeks. During those two weeks, I was texting another guy I didn‚Äôt know in person, and I really liked him online. When I came back to the city where I was studying, I went for coffee with that guy, and I didn‚Äôt like him. After that, I fell in love with my current boyfriend. That was on November 19th. I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about it, but I constantly feel guilty for not knowing right away that he was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù I told him how I felt on December 1st, but then we went home for a month and a half, and that was still during COVID.

The next thing I regret is waiting for sex. Our first kiss was on February 26th, our official relationship date was March 27th, and sex happened in September. Before that, we did everything else‚Äîrubbing without clothes, oral, hands, and a few times, he partially went inside, but just the tip. However, full PIV sex wasn‚Äôt until September. The worst part about it was that I always had to have control. I was constantly obsessed with those dates‚Äîwhen we‚Äôd officially be in a relationship, the perfect day for the first time, etc.

The last thing that bothers me is going out to clubs. My friends often pressured me, and I gave in. I didn‚Äôt have a strong sense of self. It happened about 6-8 times a year. But I never got drunk.

Right, I'm going to cut to the chase. I'm done being ""casual"" and I want something that lasts. What I'm looking for is something I'd call a romantic best friend or a kindred spirit. I'm sick of being on my own and I want my own person to do things with, go to places with, hold hands, run my fingers through his hair, look into his eyes and just melt. I'm very much love deprived so I'm after a wholesome experience with a kind being who gets me. I'm wanting a monogamous partnership which includes platonic friendship as well as crazy passionate nsfw stuff. I have never been in a relationship before so I do not want to jump into anything straightway. I'd like to get to know you more, establish a positive friendship, take time, ""test romance"" and then put my foot forward. Dating apps do not work for me because I'm conventionally not quite attractive and am a bit clumsy, socially awkward and low on confidence. 

I know I'm posting this on an nsfw sub, the reason being I'm a very sexual person at least in theory. High libido and not much real life experience so there's a lot of it pent up and I do crave physical intimacy too and there are so many things I've read about in smut that I'dlove to try with my partner, my boyfriend. If I were to elaborate more, I'd say I'm looking for someone to love, to care for, to cry with and to have frequent passionate sex with. 

Call me shallow, but I do have a type. I love an average English man, love Benedict Cumberbatch, love the guy from Fleabag (not the priest, her first bf, though the priest is crazy hot too haha). Love the posh and the southern accent too. So if you fit any of those requirements, I would love to get to know you. Seeking an intellectual, emotional connection but I also need to drool for you aha so please dont think I'm only after the looks because i know how wrong that sounds, even more so when I'm just average myself. I'd want someone close in age, 22 to 28 is ideal. 


I do not have much to recommend myself physically. Am just alright looking. Will tell you more in dms. Happy to talk and exchange pics too to get past the first stage of whether we fancy one another or not. Personality wise, I'm empathetic, emotionally very open and aware, obliging & compliant, ambivert, bookworm, a bit nerdy, smiley face been told. Attachment wise, from what I've read, I'm an anxious style and MBTI is INFP if any of that intrigues you 

Love books, classic lit is my favourite but also enjoy historical fic, stream of consciousness, bildungsroman genres and ooh romance. I'm wanting to explore other genres like realism, horror etc. So if you love enjoy reading, I think we'll be great friends. 
I also quite enjoy a coffee, walks in parks, nature, music, languages, learning new things, talking to people etc. 

I look forward to talking to you more. Even if this doesn't turn out the way I want it to, I'll be happy to atleast make friends, forge new connections and have a  conversation partner to not feel quite as lonely sometimes. X

For normal human beings, when doing affirmations, they do daily affirmations and eventually see results in their life. For me, it's the total opposite. For me, I'll start saying affirmations for things I want to see within my life, but the opposite almost always happens. 

For example, I'll wake up and say to myself, ""today is going to be an absolutely amazing day!"". What happens in that day? It goes on to be an utterly awful day. I did that yesterday. I woke up and said the affirmation, feeling like it was going to be an outstanding day. Turned out to be one of the worst days I've had in quite a while.

I tried it again today, saying in the morning that today is going to be an amazing day. I hadn't even had my morning coffee yet, and my boiler just broke, meaning no heating, when it's meant to be freezing today.....

In 2019 I was doing really well and was convinced that 2020 was going to be phenomenal. I would say over and over that 2020 is going to be the best year of my life.

Don't even bother getting me started on admiring the museum greats... or throwing secret wishes at a full moon. And, oh' the words of the most romantic poets on a candle-lit wintery night. 

Dancing in the rain amidst the rushing city was another favorite. Sometimes, it involved off-key singing or having an amusing swing around the next lamp-post. 

I'd rarely turn down the chance to stroll a secluded path through the woods. It was even better if the path eventually ended somewhere near a summer warmed lake to dip my toes in.

I always loved attending the latest blockbuster in theater. With extra butter on the oversized bucket of popcorn. Or, dressing to the nines to see The Nutcracker or Mannheim Steamroller before driving around admiring the holiday lights. End the night with the playfulness of ice-skating in a dress. *Don't fall down*... it was the best advice, to be applied under any circumstances, really.

Bet you didn't know that I loved making playlists that told the latest chapter of my insignificant life... just because even my story had a theme song. If I'd ever bravely shared the mix, you were probably a significant part of it.

I'd loved cozying up to the bar with a bestie to swap stories about the trials and tribulations of working retail, taking classes, or dating, or just existing. Dear glory... how the poor bartender's ears heard way too many details between casual rounds of flirting.

I used to love laughing at everything. And, even getting to know a random stanger without taking any of it very seriously. 

I'd loved rescuing stray animals and donating hours to charity because I'd never had enough dollars to make any difference. 

I loved dreaming beneath a mountain of fluffy blankets and waking up early enough to have coffee before facing the day. 

I'd loved painting. Still-life, watercolors without enough shadows to escape the second dimension. 

I'd loved old cars and seeing how fast they could still go on an open highway. And, the moment a 737 left the ground... because it vaguely resembled the feeling of going a little too high on the backyard swingset. 

I'd loved you... and the way you somehow managed to infiltrate everything else I had always loved. You were there, entangled in the best, and the mundane, and the very worst. The most memorable (and hopelessly forgettable) day by days had you sprinkled, here and there, like a coat of ineffable star dust. 

I used to love logic and being able to rightfully justify my actions. Clarity and emotion interlinked to make sense of events... I came with an explanation that could usually be comprehended.
I'd loved having my reasons and being able to freely give them.

But, then... you were gone. Eventually, it all turned into an insurmountable pain- twisted memories of everything I'd lost. I wasn't the same. Nothing was for a very long time. 

Until I started over... now, I love blueberry waffles. And, calm evenings- spent quietly alone, free of heartache. I've loved the simple things more than ever before. I've loved learning how to smile again.

And, you love her. And, something else, I'm sure. Whatever it be... I hope it's all been happiness.

(6 years later)
(Lily POV)
Six years have now passed since that fateful day that Stephanie died.
I wish that I could say that life has moved on, and that we have found good in the bad... but for the most part, it isn't true. Stephanie is just as much a part of this pack today as she was before she died. And the grief felt in the pack is just as raw and angry as it was that first day.
If anything has changed, it is that --instead of Stephanie being out in the center of things-- she lives on almost like a shadow over everything. She now has a couple of streets named after her --Stephanie Lane and Steffie Avenue (her nickname was ""Steffie""); the local coffee shops sell a couple of drinks dedicated to her; and you can quite literally find some of her favorite outfits on display in glass cases at various places throughout the pack.
Even more bizarre, the day she died was turned into a pack holiday, as was her birthday. Everyone but pack omegas have both days off from work, school, and training, and there are somber celebrations and remembrances planned to commemorate each occasion.
I once made the mistake of asking my parents whether this was a normal reaction to the death of a single she-wolf. We can love and miss her, but to continue to hold large ceremonies every year? And to treat her as a saint and forget that she had a human side too? That seemed a bit too much to me. As far as I know, the pack has never done this for any other luna or future luna, and it only honors 2-3 historical alphas in such a manner.
I was rewarded for my questions by being called jealous and hateful. (I also received a significant beating, but beatings had become commonplace from my mother, so I cannot say that my question necessarily triggered the beating I received that day. Plus, the beating hurt far less than what I received before Stephanie died. But for the slight pain and who did the beating, I almost would not have minded.)
Overall, I think the worst part of losing Stephanie six years ago wasn't losing Stephanie... it was how losing Stephanie impacted my relationship with my parents and other pack members.
Before Stephanie died, I was well aware that Stephanie was my parents' favorite. My older brother Nick and I would even joke about it from time to time. But even though Stephanie was their favorite, they still treated me really well and loved me. They never would have raised a hand to me before Stephanie died.
After Stephanie died, however, my parents could barely look at me. And when they did, I saw the unmistakable wish in their eyes that it had been me, not Stephanie, that died that fateful night.
In addition, my parents stopped caring about my well-being generally. I lived in their house until I was 17, but I was responsible for my own meals and necessities. I was forced to take on a part-time job at a nearby diner just to ensure I had clothes and food to eat. (I technically could have eaten the food that was available in the packhouse, but the dirty looks and mean comments made by my parents, James, and other pack members were enough to make that an unrealistic option.)
Also, in case you are wondering, I have not celebrated a birthday since Stephanie died. Not one single soul other than Rose has bothered to tell me happy birthday. No one even bothered to ask me whether I had received my wolf. That wasn't because birthdays stopped being important; it was just mine whose meaning changed.
I attended plenty of birthday parties, and the pack hosted plenty of 14th birthday celebrations. In fact, I think it was because of one of those birthday celebrations that someone finally questioned whether I had received a wolf. It was a legitimate question, given that I was over 14 and never joined a pack run. Rose encouraged me early on to skip them ""for safety reasons,"" and I was all too happy to do so.
Had anyone bothered to ask me directly about my wolf or about why I was skipping the pack runs, I would have been honest... but no one ever did. Instead, a rumor spread that I was wolfless. Pack members speculated that I lost my wolf as a result of post-traumatic stress from losing Stephanie and/or guilt for what I had done to Stephanie.
That latter theory was the one that really got under my skin, because I knew that was a theory and rumor spread by James. Shortly after Stephanie's funeral, he told my parents and most of the pack that Stephanie was only in the forest that night to save me. He also said I had gone out to meet a boy. I have no idea why he would say such things; I have never had a boyfriend and Stephanie was the one who asked me to meet her in the forest.
This rumor was the main reason that I received a beating from my mother the night of my first shift. And it probably adds to the reason that pack members feel free to wish me dead.
Notably, though, I have never dared to defend myself. To tell the truth would be the equivalent of talking negatively of both Stephanie and our future alpha.... and would likely lead to a death sentence.
So instead, I have always just pushed through. One of the ways that I have survived is to hold on to the faith that one day things will be different. Another thing that I have done is take every last opportunity to leave the pack.
For example, I hurried through high school so that I could graduate early, and I then went away to college. To avoid coming home, I have been loading up on credit hours and taking every term of school -including the mini winter sessions-- that I can get. I am also taking advantage of a unique expedited program offered just for werewolves doctors. Given all of these things, I actually expect that I can become a fully licensed werewolf doctor in just a couple more years.
Until I become fully licensed and independent, I will have to continue to bear the shadow of my sister and the pain that comes with it. I am required to be present for both of her holidays --all pack members are; there are no exceptions-- but thankfully those are among the very few times that I can reliably be found at the Western Mountain pack these days.
My ultimate goal is to meet my mate and become a pack doctor in his pack... which I pray to the Moon Goddess is not the Western Mountain pack. If, Goddess forbid, my mate is in this pack, perhaps I can convince him to transfer packs with me.
Goddess willing.
Tomorrow is my birthday. I guess we will find out then.

So, two weeks ago I let her know, I'm gonna go on a work trip to the country she lives in. Ask her out for coffee, in advance.

She accepts and says to tell her as soon as I land, so that we can meet.

I do that. She insists for me to go meet her.

We meet for coffee and stroll around through a fleamarket.

Walk her home. She gives me a long hug.
I go for a kiss.

She turns her face and says she has a boyfriend.
I ask her if it wouldn't be worth mentioning that before accepting to go on a date with me.

She tells me I never asked if she had one.

Anyway,  I've recently been talking to this girl in my class and i think she's very attractive. We only have 1 class together but we don't get a chance to talk cause we hang out with different groups. But we did make eye contact a couple times and i wanted to approach her but i pussied out. Then a couple days later I asked a mutual friend for her ig and followed her, she followed back within minutes. I made up a lie about needing help with an assignment and she agreed to help. After that I switched the topic to normal small talks (where u from, etc.) and she was replying quickly so im thinking to myself she might be into me. A few days pass, i didn't text her intentially because I didn't wanna seem desperate and I wanted our connection to feel natural and not rushed. But basically I sent her a funny reel whatever and asked her if she had any plans for the weekend. She said not really but she was gonna work on some assignments (not what i wanted to hear cause I wanted to do something fun) and I asked her if she wanted to work on them tgt. She agreed. Today, was the first time we actually talked face to face and ""hung out"". We grabbed a quick coffee at Starbucks and chatted for a bit and then headed to the library to study. Initially, she seems a little intimidating but she started to warm up to me i guess cause I was trying to crack jokes to break the ice and stuff. We had some really good convos and stuff and i was making her laugh too and we're both into bouldering and video games. **Now the issue here for me is, because we are in university, idk if she's only hanging out with me because she wants to have a study buddy or if she's genuinely attracted to me. I purposely didn't flirt with her since I wanted to take things slow and I was worried that she might find it weird since it was our first time actually hanging out and we were just studying on campus. Now, I know the next move for me would be to see if she wants to go bouldering tgt, i'm just not sure when i should and when I do, should I start flirting more with her or should i just hang out with her as ""friends"" and get more comfortable around each other?**",1,1731841533.0,AskMenAdvice,3,1.0,False

Part 2:

So after i (23) came home, i was kind of ashamed. My fiance didn't know anything that happened and it felt a bit weird returning to regular life knowing what a slut I've been. I couldn't stop thinking about it.

Very fast that shame became lust. I was so horny thinking about my old neighbor (45) fucking me rough, i masturbated to it a lot. And the feeling of having my fantasy realised was amazing. But now i couldn't help but want more. 

I dealt with a lot of insecurities about it for about three days and then i couldn't take it anymore. I texted my neighbor. He was surprised to hear from me but also happy. After like 3 messages he didn't hesitate and asked ""so, do you want to come over for coffee and catch up? üòâ"" to which i replied ""yes"".

We set a date and time for like two days after that day that we were both free and my fiance at work. We continued chatting and it got a bit dirty. He said what he felt like missing out on doing to me, and that he want to last longer next time to fully appreciate my body. He also said stuff like ""thought about your thick ass and thighs and small round tits all the time"" and that he masturbated to me a lot.

That turned me so fucking on. I was on fire. I started masturbating right away, and told him about it. He was very excited and told me more of what he'd do to me and that got me cumming pretty quick and hard. After that he said ""you're a good little slut"" and i was horny all over again. As i answered ""yes daddy, i am"" he replied ""well, would the little slut like me to call a friend to join us for coffee?"".

I was a bit shocked, haven't replied to him for a few minutes to process what I'm feeling. I felt like ""fuck, this is the sluttiest thing i could do. Can i do it? I know i shouldn't but fuckkk that is like two fantasies in one"". At this time he got a bit nervous and said ""or it could be just us, i just want you to have a good time"". And after seeing that message i thought ""i did it once, I'm about to get married and i didn't have sex with anyone other than my fiance and this guy. I wont pass the opportunity."" And replied him ""sure, I'd love to meet your friend ü§≠"".

I only asked for his age, i find it hotter the less i know. He told me he was 52 and worked with him. I thought i was in a dream, or a movie (the kind i like üòâ) and i was in ecstasy thinking about it. I masturbated so much and though about it a lot. Then, finally came the day.

I put on some sexy lingerie like a good little girl and loose clothes, just enough to keep the lingerie a surprise, and went over. I knocked on his door nervous as hell and feeling horny already, he opened up, smiled and let me in. He greeted me and gave me a hug and then he led me to the living room there was his friend. He's friend was a bit shorter than him, dark hair and a bit of a beer belly, dad bod vibe. He definitely looked to be 52 and that got me so hot, i thought about how he is here to fuck me and that made me wet. We greeted, he was a bit nervous and shocked that a pretty 23 yo came in, guess he wasn't expecting that, and we sat down.

The first guy (I'll call him paul) went to make coffee and i stayed with his friend (I'll call him rob). We talked a bit, both embarrassed, and then he said ""you are very beautiful"", to which i smirked and said ""thank you"". He then said ""you look like you work out a lot, you have an amazing body"" and i got all red and thanked him again. He didn't hesitate and right after he said ""you have big thighs and butt for a girl this fit, like you have it all"" he blushed as if he was pushing boundaries. I was already dripping at this point, and i giggled and said ""thanks, glad you liked it, is it that good?"" And i stood up and turned around to show him my ass from the side. He was in awe, i think he thought he was dreaming. He said ""it is a perfect ass for a perfect girl"".

Staring at my ass and body he asked if he can feel it to which i said yes. He slowly grabbed a handfull of my ass and rubbed it, then he grabbed my thighs and waist letting out a rough moan as he did it and fineshed with giving me a little slap on the ass saying ""such a hot young thing"". As i was standing there letting him grab me, Paul returned with the coffee and said ""have you already started?"". Rob looked at him and asked ""Paul, where did you get this little hottie?"" To whick i replied ""thank you"" all red embarrassed and giggling.

Paul put down the coffee and approached me, started touching me everywhere, bragging to Rob ""yes, isn't she a good little princess? I'm so lucky to have her"". He did it like he owned me and showed me off to his friend, that got me dripping through my clothes again. I let him touch me and said ""i like being a princess"" and turned around to him. He kissed me grabbing my ass and gently spreding my legs. Then he turnes me to Rob who's sitting now in front of me and is shocked. I lean in and kiss him, as he kissess me he gently grabs my ass and pulls me closer. I get on top of he as we make out and he is touching me all over, already feeling how wet i am. He starts to feel comfortable and being rougher, like he is holding up a lot and letting loose slowly.

Paul closed the drapes and turned down the light, then he went to his room for a few minutes leaving me and Rob alone. Meanwhile Rob started kissing my chest and uncovered my lingerie. His face was like a child on Christmas. He called Paul and said ""Paul, you have to see what the princess is wearing for us"", Paul got back in boxers and i took of my shorts to reveal a sexy red lingerie set. Paul was excited and said ""princess, i love your outfit, you should be always walking like that"" and i said ""i will"". Then he just approached me, grabbing me again and pulling me into him, he cant wait, i can already feel his hard dick in his boxers. And Rob was rubbing my ass and pussy and kissing me all over.

Paul pushed my down on my knees and i immediately took his dick out, it was even prettier than before. And i turned to Rob, pulled his pants down and unveiled a big dick, it was a darker shade as Rob had darker skin and it was amazing. Both cocks in front of me, from two older guys that want to use me and waiting for me to put their cocks in my mouth. I started sucking immediately. Never sucked two dicks before, at first i hurried  not to leave one dick hanging for too long but i relaxed and started sucking like i know, every dick in his turn, they both got attention. As i suck their cocks they told me too look up and i saw two horny, older men with their dicks in front of me and felt like such a slut, i was rubbing myself. 

Paul told me to get on the couch and keep sucking Rob, he then went down on me as he said he wanted in the texts. It was ok, but i was just so focused on sucking rob to full mast. I saw Rob twitching and knew he saw about to cum, so i went full force and made him cum in my mouth, i looked up at him, showed him my mouth and then swallow like i know to do. That made him so horny, his dick was still hard but he took a break. Meanwhile paul said we should move to the bedroom and we agreed. 

Entering a dark bedroom with one small reading lamp on and drapes closed was so hot. I immediately started sucking them both again. This time rob wanted to fuck me. And paul told me to get on all fours and take him in the mouth and rob from behing. Rob still had a semi, and as he etered my wet pussy he said ""fuckk, you are so tight"" and started fucking me, his dick got hard inside me. Paul picked up the pace too, at one point they were entering me at the same time and i was so horny and felt like a huge slut i couldn't hold myself and came so hardd. Rob continued fucking me and said ""good girl, cum more for me"" and Paul fucked my mouth so hard he came, partly in my mouth and a bit in my face and hair.

Paul said ""you are such a good little slut princess, i love having you and using you"" and i started to get there again, moaning and enjoying myself. Paul put his dick back in my mouth untill he was hard again and Rob was about to cum. I moved my ass on rob to make him cum, he slapped me so hard and said ""this is such a good ass to fuck all day"" and then he started cumming again in me and pulled out to get some on my ass.

Paul guided me to ride him reverse cowgirl (also said he wanted it in the texts) and then he said ""keep sucking rob"". I did as i was told, rob was already exhausted but still giving me his dick, as paul fucks me and slaps my ass. I suck rob untill he is hard again, but cumming two times takes a toll so he wasn't full mast. Paul grabs me and puts me on his dick untill he cums deep inside. I get off him, dripping his cum, robs cum and my own on him, he takes it on his fnger and puts it in my mouth, i swallow of course. Rob grabs my body again, he didn't get enough, and starts being a bit rougher. Slapping my ass, squeezing my boobs and saying stuff like ""good little fuck toy, i love enjoying you"". Then he puts me in missionary and gives it his all. Me being filled with cum enjoying myself like a slut and then he pushes his finger on my clit as he fucks me. That was a really intense feeling as i didn't get clit action much so i came very quick. And rob came inside me right after, whispering ""i wanted to cum in you again so much"".

We all take our breath, lay there and giggle for a while. We got up, our coffee cold, oops, but paul made another batch, as i took a shower. Then we drank coffee, talked about what happened and they were very appreciating for everything. They said how much they like my body and that i am the light of their day and such.

We fineshed and i went back home.
Still had cum inside, feeling like such a slut.
It was wonderful 

TLDR: after my (23) first time sleeping with anyone other than my bf and an older guy too, i wanted more. So i talked with the neighbor (45) again and said i wanted to meet again, he then proposed to bring a friend (52), to which i agreed. We met, and he and his friends enjoyed me. They spitroasted me, fucked me doggy, came in my mouth and pussy and used me like a good slut.",0,1731841471.0,cheating_stories,4,0.25,False

Part 1:

Anyway, my story is, i (23) got engaged a while back to my bf of nearly 8 years. He was my first and only one untill now.

And the feeling of missing out on casual sex all my life when i have such a huge sex drive, drove me crazy. So i guessed if i was going to fulfill my fantasy i will go all the way.

I always loved older guys, i find them so attractive and sophisticated. There is an older guy (45) that i always meet on my dog walks and he is always nice to me and we have a bit of small talk. And i caught his glimps of my ass in yoga pants and tight shorts at times, he also sneaked a peak at my boobs when i was braless, and i saw him do that and didn't mind.

On one of my walks with the dog i saw my neighbor unloading his car, i was in a tank top and loose shorts. I said hello as i usually do and asked if he needs help with anything. He said he didn't need any help but i insisted on taking a bag with me and walk him to his house. He eventually agreed and i walked with him to his place, he was embarrassed and thanked me a lot for it.

When we got there he said ""Thank you very much, can i get you some water?"" I said ""sure, I'd love a glass, thank you"" and he then said that i can come in,  and i can let my dog loose in the yard if i want, so that's what i did. When he saw me coming in he immediately said ""do you want anything else? Coffee maybe?"", i said ""no, thank you, i dont want to be a bother"". He replied with ""it's not a bother at all"" and then i thought ""THIS, this is my chance"", and said ""actually I'd love a cup"".

After he made us coffee we sat in his ling room and had some small talk. He asked me about my age and i his, he told me that he was divorced and he knew i was engaged. I thought to myself ""how do i get the conversation get spicy?"" So i told him that I'm sad the summer is ending. He asked why and i said ""i love to go to the beach, and i got a new swim suit too but its getting pretty cold"". He was stunned by my answer and got a bit embarrassed. Then he said ""that's a shame, but you can still wear it otherwise üòÖ"". I said that i really wanted to show it off and he embarrassingly replied ""well that's a shame to all that would have seen it"".

As i saw him embarrassed and wanted to push things i just showed him a pic of me in that bathing suit. He got all red and said ""wow, it suits you, you have a nice body"", and i said ""thank you, i like it that you like my body ‚ò∫Ô∏è"". He looked at me with pure lust, like he was holding back, and he said ""your fiance is a lucky man"", to which i replied ""thank you, do you know what he loves the most about me?"", ""your ass?"" He said embarrassingly like he tried to shoot a risky comment. I said laughing ""well yeah, but for my head game as well"", he was shocked. 

Not a moment after i just bluntly asked ""do you want me to show you?"" And he got back to himself, stuttering he asked ""wha what about your fiance?"" And i answerd that i always wanted to try what its like with an older man. His expression went from embarrassed and uncomfortable to pure lust and predatory. He just said ""i always wanted to fuck you"" and just pulled me closer and kissed me, as he put his hands on my thighs and squeez them.

I was insanly wet at that point, like i staind his couch through my panties and my loose shorts. I though to myself ""what am i doing?? Fuck it, it happened, I'm letting my slut out completely"". As he ran his hand on my thigh through the bottoms of my shorts he said ""fuck, your ass is so hot"" and kissed my neck, i immediately saw he was rock hard through his jean shorts. 

At that point i am drenched, and he feels it. He can't help but just slide his finger inside of me and says ""you are so wet, and tight, i love it"". I moan like crazy, feeling like I'm about to cum, he grabbed and layed me down the sofa as his finger is still inside me and i just came moments after. It was amazing! 

After that i just got on my knees and told him to sit down, then i unbuckled him and pulled his shorts down, revealing a beatiful hard dick at full mast. I admired it and told him that, he put his hand on my cheek as i started licking his dick base to tip, giving the tip a little kiss every time. That drove him crazy, and i loved it. After i sucked on his balls ad got back to his tip he got tired of waiting and just pushem my head down on him.

I sucked long and hard, giving him a sloppy bj, looking him in the eyes and smiling with his dick in my mouth. He couldn't last two minutes and came in my mouth. I (as i am trained to do) looked up at him, showed him my cum filled mouth and swallowed it, smiling in the end. He said ""you are such a princess, i loved your mouth"".

He grabbed my body, my ass and thighs saying ""i love your body, you are such a hot little princess"" and i giggled and said thanks. He got up, and i saw he was already hard again, he flipped me over so he could fuck me doggy style, pulled my soaking sorts and panties down and pulled me close to him. As his dick touched my lips i got dripping again (i was already wet) and he just shoved his dick in me. As he fucked me rough saying things like ""good princess"", ""such a hot ass"" and ""you like me fucking you?"" To which i reply everytime with ""yes daddy"". He came quickly after and as i felt his hot cum filling me up i came as well.

After that we cleaned ourselves and decided it was a secret. We exchanged numbers ""just in case üòâ"" and i left.


TLDR: I'm (23) engaged to the only guy i slept with and i wanted to try sex with an older man. I sucked my neighbor (45) at his house after meeting him on a walk and wanted more...
I teased him at his olace till he was going crazy and thenn told him i wanted to fuck. I sucked his dick like a good girl and swallowed his cum, then he fucked me raw and came inside.

1gtb7ya,https://i.redd.it/4t9xil0a1g1e1.jpeg,Cooler Master Cm 690 II (?),"Hi all,

Firstly, this is not my PC - it‚Äôs absolutely disgusting at the moment but I‚Äôll be cleaning it up tomorrow. This was originally my dad‚Äôs and he gave it to my mum, I‚Äôve since built her a new PC and want to rebuild this PC to give back to my dad (he loved the hot swap feature on this case). I believe this is a cooler master 690 II case, but it‚Äôs at least a decade old and the stickers have all been removed from the case. What I‚Äôm after are ideas on parts to build this case back up to a power horse. My dad doesn‚Äôt game, but he likes to edit things and fiddle around with software. I would like to keep below the $1500AUD mark if possible. The power supply, case fans and RAM (DDR4 32gb) are all fine and I‚Äôd like to use these in the build, but otherwise I‚Äôm open to suggestions! Would love to know what others would put in something like this. 
My only requirements are that I would like to stick with AMD, not intel (just personal preference here), and I‚Äôd like a motherboard with wifi capabilities (as I know his router is not near the computer room, and it isn‚Äôt feasible to run a cable across the place). I‚Äôd also like the PC to have an NVME for the primary drive and then an SSD for the secondary, and to run a liquid CPU cooler. I know that this box is on the smaller side for current trends, I think it‚Äôs around a mid size box, and I believe I‚Äôll end up having to run a mini ATX or micro for the motherboard, but not 100% sure. I‚Äôve attached a photo of the case as it is at the moment (please don‚Äôt slam for the condition, it will be thoroughly cleaned, my mum spilled come coffee on it accidentally this morning as we were pulling it out, and she doesn‚Äôt understand how to care/clean a PC, though this is being taught to her now), and a link to the specs. 
Hit me with your ideas! Looking to be inspired with different options here. Thanks in advance.

I haven't used any yet, but based on my experiences and preferences I would like to see a few changes in the game. For example, I would like the environment to look a bit older, perhaps with more nature or generally more destroyed. I would also like it if crafting was more restricted or more expensive, and you were more dependent on finds. I would like power armor to be less common, as well as fusion cores. I mostly play survival, and I think the difficulty is appropriate, but the stronger the weapons become, the difficulty seems to decrease. So I would also like it if the weapons were generally not as strong, but perhaps it would be enough if there were not so many strong weapons available. I would also like to have the inventory modded, e.g. so that you can't carry as much, and generally not so many weapons. So, for example, one main, one secondary, and maybe an alternative, such as a sawed-off shotgun. Maybe there are even mods that regulate the transport of raw materials, so that you don't go on a raid and carry around 9 screwdrivers, 20 coffee mugs, 3 bags of fertilizer, and two teddy bears? I know that collecting is a central point of the game, but it always feels a bit funny, if you know what I mean. At the same time, I would like to level up faster, so that you can enjoy the perks that enrich the game more quickly. That could also dampen the increasing difficulty level through the other adjustments. Better visuals would also be a nice bonus, although not a must. I play on PC, so there should be enough power available.  
Thanks for any suggestions.

  
TLDR

looking for a mod

1gtb33i,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gtb33i/he_used_me/,He used me,"I met this guy 14 years ago and I love him deeply. It took long time for us to get on our feet and be ready to start think in terms of having a baby. The last year we have been talking about how wonderful it will be and how cute they will be. I love him so much I thought he would be a perfect dad and I was so joyful for this Christmas where he finally would move back home after living 1,5 years abroad to do what he loves (snowboard) and while saving money for our next apartment. We live terribly small in the city center (big city). He went through financial issues 2022 which I supported him through and he lied saying he did better. That year we made a payment plan. We shared all fixed costs but I payed every little ""perk"" cost that wasn't our shared costs. Like a Christmas tree or that coffee take away or anything else to make life a little sweeter every now and then. We went through that a full year. 

Then christmas came and his hidden credit cards fell out from a stash in a locker right onto the floor in front of my mum. In January the abuse started. It was all my fault he needed to spend money. I was a control freak, a monster..  Somehow not sure how I managed to get him to see a psychologist and he got help. He took the job abroad and payed off his credit cards bills. Another year passed with me asking every few weeks if he still was in therapy, how he was doing mentally, how he was feeling, if he enjoyed his life, if he felt ok. Going through our shared expenses together in a big excel sheet every month. Soon as he managed to pay them off (this spring) he started to transfer money to our savings and our savings grew.

With that I started to trust him more and more and I was even able to open up about how I had felt during our darkest times. How he was abusive and how it made me feel. Every month we went through our expenses together looking at our spendings. I went to therapy to learn to trust him and to learn to let go. 

All the time he had 6000 usd at his account as a buffer which we constantly talked about how we would use. Looking at apartments this summer talking about moving abroad together, starting a family in the beginning of next year.

He flied home to see me this weekend. We where planing on grabbing a lunch together, maybe drive away a bit doing something fun together. But Thursday before this weekend I talked to my therapist again and he lifted what he saw as a red flag and asked me to check in with my partner to see the balance sheet of his buffer account. 


Well yesterday at first he refused and he said it was some money left but not all because of taxation. 

Then this morning after lots of asking he showed the account and it was completely empty. 

He lied every month the last year. He stopped going to therapy.

Anytime I praised him this spring and summer he didn't flinch when I said I was proud of him. Not once. And I'm pretty sure I told him a thousand times I'm proud he has changed and I can see his growth. Well it was all lies. I'm 34. Soon it's too late to have children. I waited almost 4 years for him to get better while supporting him. He used me.

In my last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/s/qHeVjjnWA7) here, I asked for a replacement for our current superautomatic machine. 

Since then I have taken a closer look at the Oracle Jet and it seems to tick a lot of boxes for us. 
If you can trust the reviews on YouTube, it pairs the ease of use of a superautomatic with the ability to brew great drinks. 
The only real downside I currently see, compared to a dual boiler, is that I won't be able to brew coffee and foam milk at the same time. However I don't know if that is really a huge problem. 

My current plan would be to get the Oracle Jet now and once I outgrow the built-in grinder, I would buy a single dose grinder (e.g. DF64) and do all the puck prep myself. 
When catering for friends or family though, I could still use the built-in grinder and quickly get out a number of drinks. 

What do you all think of that plan? 
Anything else I'd be losing when choosing the Oracle Jet over a Ascaso Duo PID or similar?

-Techno was good/not fully involved in the abuse.  Carl was canon and after Tommy went through abuse Techno would take him out to ride Carl.  After Phil is arrested, Carl got put in like a public stable?
-Specific punishment where Tommy would go into Phil's office and get beat w a belt, but we only find this out at court after
-Tommy testifies in court, Phil gets arrested and Techno gets mandated therapy.  Wilbur attacks Tommy outside of the courthouse and also gets arrested
-Tommy was drugged every night through tea, and there was one scene where he calls it out and Phil was like 'you knew??' And Tommy backtracts and says that he thought the tea put him to sleep because of the specific herbs like chamomile
-Tommy still went to school, Sam was his teacher and was very concerned about Tommy.  I think eventually through Sam is how Tommy got out
-Tommy was friends with Tubbo and maybe Ranboo?  But SBI didn't let them see each other.  I think they met up once, but SBI got really upset about it

The announcement echoed through Munich's central station, first in German, then Italian, and finally in English. Sofia wheeled her carry-on down Platform 12, past windows reflecting the early October sun. She rechecked her ticket: Car 24, Seat 65, window.¬†

The carriage was empty except for a few early passengers settling in with books and laptops. She hoisted her bag into the overhead rack and methodically arranged her essentials‚Äîtablet,¬† sketchbook, coffee from the station cafe‚Äîon the pull-down table‚Äîa creature of habit, even when running away. The seat across from her remained empty as other passengers filed past. Three minutes to departure. Sofia uncapped her coffee, inhaling the familiar comfort of robusta beans that weren't entirely Italian. She had just pulled out her tablet when movement in her peripheral vision made her glance up.

A tall figure paused by her table, checking his ticket with a slight frown. His olive backpack looked well-traveled, and a pair of professional headphones hung around his neck.¬†

""Excuse me,"" he said in careful German, pointing to the seat across from her. ""I think I'm‚Äî""

""Achtundsechzig?"" Sofia asked, gesturing to the window seat opposite, proud of remembering the German number from her ticket-checking moments ago.



He nodded, looking relieved. As he stored his backpack overhead, Sofia noticed how his sweater sleeves were pushed up to the elbows, revealing a simple watch on one wrist and what looked like a festival band on the other. He settled into his seat just as the train lurched gently into motion.

The departure announcement crackled through the train car, first in German, then Italian, followed by what was presumably meant to be English. Sofia caught something about a delayed lunch service in the Italian version, while the German announcement seemed to be apologizing for the air conditioning. The English translation confidently declared that passengers would "" embrace their warm fellowship during this journey.""

She couldn't help the small laugh that escaped her, quickly covering it with a cough. Across the table, the man looked up from where he'd been fiddling with what appeared to be a small recording device. He made a similar sound of amusement, poorly disguised as clearing his throat.¬†

When their eyes met, he gestured vaguely at the speaker overhead and attempted, in careful German, ""Das war... interessant?""

Sofia straightened, relieved to have someone to share the moment with, and responded in her best German, ""Ja, sehr..."" she paused, searching for the word, then simply made a confused face and waved her hands.

He laughed ‚Äì a genuine one this time ‚Äì and his relief was palpable when he asked, ""English?""

""Oh, thank god,"" Sofia said, her laugh more relaxed now. ""My German stops at ordering coffee and apologizing.""

""Same. I just wasted three months of Duolingo on one terrible sentence."" His English carried a distinct Scandinavian lilt.¬†

He extended his hand across their shared table. ""Oskar.

""Sofia."" His hand was warm, the handshake brief but firm.¬†



She again noticed the headphones around his neck, the kind audio professionals used. The morning light caught the metal details of the ear cups, which were definitely expensive ones.



They settled into a comfortable silence as Munich's outskirts blurred past the window. Sofia pulled out her tablet, then found herself distracted by Oskar setting up what looked like a small recording device on the window ledge. When he caught her looking, he seemed slightly embarrassed.

""Work,"" he explained, though something in his tone suggested otherwise. ""The train sounds, they're, uh... interesting.""



Sofia nodded, not entirely convinced but charmed by what seemed like an excuse as flimsy as her own 'client meeting' in Venice. She turned to the window, watching the city fade into the countryside, aware of his presence in a way that made her simultaneously want to start another conversation and pretend to be completely absorbed in her work.



The train curved, and morning sunlight swept across their table. They both reached to adjust their screens against the glare, their hands almost colliding.¬†

""Sorry,"" they said in unison, then shared another laugh, smaller this time, more uncertain.



Sofia tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and returned to her tablet, pulling up the client brief she'd only half-read before boarding. But the words blurred as she listened to the train's rhythm, wondering why and if that's what he was recording.

Her ""Deep Focus"" Spotify playlist ‚Äì usually reliable for drowning out distractions ‚Äì wasn't doing its job. Three lo-fi songs in, and she'd retained nothing of the client brief on her screen. The ambient music that generally helped her through deadline nights in Milan felt pointless here. Instead, her attention kept drifting to the gentle click of Oskar's keyboard as he worked and the way he occasionally tilted his head, listening to something through one side of his headphones while letting the other ear stay free.

Outside, Munich's suburbs had given way to the Bavarian countryside. Sofia had taken this route before, but always on overnight trains, too focused on work to notice the landscape. But with the morning light playing across distant peaks, she reached for her sketchbook instead of her tablet.

""They get better,"" Oskar said suddenly.

Sofia pulled out an earbud. ""I‚Äôm sorry?""

He nodded toward the window. ""The mountains. About twenty minutes from now, they're...""

He paused and seemed to search for the right word. ""Overwhelming? In a good way.""

""You've done this journey before?""

""A few times. Different seasons."" He adjusted his recording device slightly.¬†

""The train sounds different in tunnels during summer than winter. More echo when it's cold."" He caught himself and looked almost embarrassed.¬†

""Sorry, occupational hazard. I notice weird things.""

""No, that's interesting."" Sofia closed her tablet cover.¬†

""Like how buildings sound different, too. Empty ones versus lived-in ones.""

His eyes lit up. ""Exactly. Most people think of spaces visually, but‚Äî""

The train entered a tunnel, and their table suddenly reflected their faces in the darkened window. They both straightened slightly, caught in this unexpected mirror. When they emerged back into the sunlight, Sofia wasn‚Äôt sketching the mountains but the curved ceiling of the train car, adding notes about acoustics in the margins.

""Coffee?"" Oskar asked after a while, starting to stand. ""I think I saw a cart going through the next car.""

""Sure, thanks."" Sofia reached for her bag, but he waved it off.

""I've got it. Unless you don't trust a stranger's coffee choices?""

She smiled. ""Surprise me. Just‚Äî""

""Let me guess,"" he interrupted, a glint in his eye.¬†

""No milk after eleven AM and heaven forbid any flavored syrups?""

""Am I that obviously Italian?""

""Says the woman who's been wincing at her station coffee for the past hour."" He grinned, and Sofia felt something flutter in her chest. A dimple appeared when he smiled like that, just on one side.

While he was gone, she looked at his abandoned headphones on the table, expensive yet worn in a way that suggested daily use. His laptop screen had gone dark, but a sticker on its cover caught her eye‚Äîthe logo of a gaming studio she recognized from her nephew's endless chatter about virtual worlds.

The coffee cart's wheels squeaked somewhere nearby, and Sofia quickly looked back to her sketchbook, not wanting to be caught examining his things. But her pencil moved aimlessly, no longer focused on architecture. Instead, she wondered what kind of person records train sounds and makes jokes about coffee customs, yet seems to be running away from something just like she is.

Oskar returned with two cups and a conspiratorial expression.

¬†""The coffee cart lady? Definitely from somewhere near Milano. We had a whole conversation about proper espresso while she judged my Swedish accent.""

""Oh no."" Sofia laughed.¬†

""Did she give you the speech about how Germans ruin coffee?""

""Better. She offered to adopt me and teach me 'the proper way' to drink it."" He set one cup in front of her.¬†

""Fair warning though‚ÄîI think she made yours extra strong out of patriotic duty.""

Their fingers brushed as she accepted the cup, and this time, neither pulled away quite as quickly as politeness required. Sofia wrapped her hands around the cup, inhaling deeply.¬†

""Ah, she used the emergency espresso stash. They don't serve this to regular passengers.""

""Emergency espresso?"" Oskar raised an eyebrow, and his one-sided dimple appeared again.

""Every Italian train attendant has one. It's like a cultural obligation."" She took a sip and sighed contently.¬†

""Though I'm curious how you charmed it out of her. We're usually very protective of the good coffee.""

""I might have mentioned I was reading Elena Ferrante in Swedish translation."" He pulled a worn paperback from his laptop bag, its spine creased with use. ""It was either going to win her over or deeply offend her.""

Sofia laughed. ""Bold strategy. My nonna would either try to feed you or lecture you about reading it in 'some Viking language.'"" She caught herself, surprised by how easily the personal detail had slipped out. She didn't usually talk about her grandmother with strangers.

""Viking language?"" His eyes crinkled with amusement as he took a sip of his coffee. ""Should I be offended on behalf of Sweden?""

""Says the man who probably thinks all Italian coffee is the same.""

""Not anymore. The coffee cart lady gave me a detailed education about the regional differences."" He leaned forward slightly. ""Though I did zone out somewhere around the proper water temperature for beans from Sicily versus Tuscany.""

A notification pinged on his laptop. Oskar glanced at it, and something flickered across his face ‚Äì a shadow of whatever he was traveling away from, Sofia guessed. She recognized that look; she'd seen it in her reflection enough lately.

""So,"" she said, deliberately keeping her tone light, ""what does a Swedish..."" she paused, realizing they hadn't exchanged that information yet.

""Sound designer,"" he supplied, seeming grateful for the redirect. ""For games, mostly. Though right now I'm..."" he made a vague gesture with his coffee cup, ""between projects.""

Sofia nodded, understanding the weight of those unsaid words.¬†

""Between projects"" felt like the professional equivalent of her own ""just need a change of scenery"" explanation for this trip.

The train began to climb more steeply, and the morning light shifted, throwing geometric patterns across their table. Sofia reached for her phone, switching to the camera app with practiced ease.

""Sorry, work habit,"" she murmured, angling her phone to capture the interplay of light and shadow across the white table surface. ""The way these angles intersect..."" She took three quick shots, each from a slightly different position.

""No, please,"" Oskar said, pulling back his coffee cup to give her a better frame.

Something in his voice made her look up. He watched her with curious interest, that half-smile playing at his lips again.¬†

""You're cataloging visual inspiration. I do the same thing with sounds.""

Sofia smiled back. ""And here I was trying to be subtle about documenting everything.""

""Says the woman photographing a train table.""

""Says the man recording the sound of mountain tunnels.""

His recording device let out a soft beep then, and they both turned to watch as the train rounded a bend. The view transformed dramatically ‚Äì sheer cliffs rising on one side, a vast valley opening up on the other, and morning mist clinging to distant peaks. Sofia lowered her phone, no longer interested in geometric patterns.

""Overwhelming?"" she asked, echoing his earlier description.

""Ja,"" he answered softly, forgetting to speak English for a moment.¬†

They sat in companionable silence, watching the landscape unfold. The coffee cart's wheels squeaked somewhere in the distance, and a toddler in the next car let out a delighted laugh at the view, but these sounds seemed to exist in another world entirely. Stealing glances at Oskar's profile as he gazed out the window, Sofia noted how the tension he'd carried earlier had eased somewhat. She wondered if she looked equally different now, equally far from the woman who had boarded the train in Munich with her carefully constructed explanations.

""I've always wondered,"" Oskar said, breaking their comfortable silence, ""what architects listen to when they design."" He gestured to her earbuds, still dangling unused over her tablet. ""Other than lo-fi study playlists.""



Sofia laughed, caught off-guard by his observation of her Spotify screen earlier.¬†

""Depends on the project. Sometimes silence. Sometimes, whatever matches the space's intended emotion."" She paused, considering. ""I once designed an entire yoga studio listening to nothing but rainfall sounds.""



""And did it work? Did the space feel like rain?""



""Actually, yes. The client said it felt... fluid. Meditative."" She tilted her head, studying him. ""But you already knew that would work, didn't you? The connection between sound and spatial feeling.""



His smile turned thoughtful.¬†

""It's what I love about sound design. In games, we're not just creating noise ‚Äì we're building atmosphere, emotion, memory.""



""It's like that with buildings too,"" Sofia said, warming to the topic. ""Every space holds emotional imprints. When I design, I'm not just thinking about walls and windows ‚Äì I'm thinking about how morning light might make someone feel hopeful or how the right ceiling height can make a room feel safe rather than imposing."" She traced a finger along the window frame. ""Architecture is really just emotional memory made tangible.""



""That's exactly it."" Oskar leaned forward, animated now. ""Sound works the same way. Like... you know that feeling when you hear rain on a tin roof? It's not just water-hitting metal. It's every childhood afternoon spent reading in bed, every lazy Sunday morning, every cozy moment of feeling sheltered while the world does its thing outside."" He gestured to his recording device. ""That's what I'm always chasing ‚Äì those sound memories that live in our bones.""



The train entered a tunnel, the window suddenly mirror-black, their reflections overlapping in the glass. When they emerged back into the sunlight, the landscape had changed again ‚Äì stark rock faces giving way to gentler slopes dotted with tiny houses that looked like scattered dice from this height.

Sofia watched Oskar as he adjusted his recording levels. There was something compelling about someone who understood space and emotion from such a different angle than her own. When he glanced up and caught her looking, neither of them immediately looked away.

A message notification lit up her phone screen. Marco's name appeared briefly before she flipped the phone face-down, but not quickly enough. She saw Oskar notice and saw him choose not to ask. The comfortable intimacy of their conversation wavered, and suddenly, the real reasons for their journeys felt too close to ignore.

The notification had shifted something in the air between them. Sofia watched the Alpine landscape blur past, aware of how her phone sat between them like a small dark confession.¬†

""I was offered my dream job in Munich yesterday,"" Oskar said suddenly, his voice quiet but clear against the train's rhythm. ""Lead sound designer for Avalanche Studios. The kind of role I've been working toward for years."" He paused, fidgeting with his recording device. ""They want an answer by Monday.""

Sofia turned from the window to study his profile. ""But you're not sure?""

""That's just it - I am sure. It's perfect. Almost too perfect."" He ran a hand through his hair, messing it up slightly. ""And instead of celebrating or calling my parents, I bought a ticket to Venice. Just... needed some space to think."" He gestured at his recording device with a self-deprecating smile. ""Figured capturing some new sounds might help clear my head.""

""From what?""

""From everyone else's certainty, I guess. My friends all say I'd be crazy not to take it. They're probably right."" His fingers drummed lightly on the table. ""But it's not just a job, is it? It's a whole life. Living in Munich, being that person, making those choices..."" He trailed off, then added quietly, ""I just need to know I'm saying yes because I want to, not because I'm supposed to.""

The honesty in his voice made something shift in Sofia's chest. She glanced at her phone again, then decisively tucked it into her bag.

""I have a client meeting in Venice,"" she said, the words coming easier than expected. ""Except I don't. I mean, I did, but I canceled it yesterday. I just... kept the train ticket."" She took a breath. ""My ex-boyfriend is taking over the Milan project I've spent two years on. A cultural center that was supposed to be my breakthrough design. He's probably in my office right now, reviewing my plans, suggesting improvements, being perfectly reasonable about everything while our entire social circle pretends this isn't incredibly weird.""

""When did you break up?""

""Six weeks ago. But the project handover meeting is today."" She laughed, but it came out slightly hollow. ""Hence the sudden urgent need to discuss hypothetical renovations with a hypothetical client in Venice.""

Oskar nodded slowly. ""So we're both running away.""

""I prefer to think of it as a strategic retreat.""

""Into art and architecture?""

""Says the man recording train sounds 'for inspiration.'""

His half-smile returned, warming his eyes. ""Touch√©.""¬†

The train entered a tunnel, the window suddenly mirror-black, their reflections overlapping in the glass. When they emerged back into the sunlight, the landscape had changed again ‚Äì stark rock faces giving way to gentler slopes dotted with tiny houses that looked like scattered dice from this height.

""It's strange,"" Oskar said, adjusting his recording device. ""I spend my life creating soundscapes that help players feel grounded in virtual worlds, but lately..."" He trailed off, watching the mountains drift by.

""But lately, you feel disconnected from your own?"" Sofia suggested quietly, recognizing something in his hesitation.

He looked at her, surprised. ""Yeah. Exactly. Like I'm somehow between soundtracks.""

""We have a term in architecture ‚Äì 'transitional spaces.' They're meant to help people move between different environments, different states of being."" She traced a finger along the window frame. ""Though lately, I feel like I'm stuck in one.""



Their eyes met, and Sofia felt that flutter in her chest again, stronger this time. The train began its descent through the Brenner Pass, and the late morning sun caught Oskar's profile, softening the determined set of his jaw. She wondered if he was thinking, as she was, about how strange it was to feel so understood by a stranger on a train.

""Can I ask you something?"" Sofia said, surprising herself with the question.

""Sure.""

""What does Munich sound like? To you, I mean. As a sound designer.""

Oskar's hand stilled on his recording device. He just watched the mountains slide past for a moment as if listening to something in his memory.

""It's..."" he started, then stopped. Tried again. ""The city has this constant low hum. Not unpleasant, just... relentless. Like it's always breathing in but never quite breathing out."" His fingers tapped an unconscious rhythm on the table. ""The studio is in this beautiful historic building, all high ceilings and modern art. But the acoustics are too perfect, you know? Too controlled. Even the coffee machine sounds exactly the same every morning.""

He caught himself, almost embarrassed by the revelation hidden in his critique. ""That probably sounds ridiculous.""

""No,"" Sofia said softly, recognizing the same uncertainty she felt about Milan in his description of Munich's too-perfect sounds. ""It sounds like a place waiting for you to fit into it instead of making space for who you are.""

The train emerged from a tunnel, sunlight flooding their compartment. Oskar's recording device beeped softly, capturing the transition from enclosed echo to open air.

""That's exactly it,"" he said, looking at her with a mix of surprise and relief. ""Unmoored. That's the word I've been avoiding all morning.""

""Drifting?"" Sofia offered.

""By choice, though."" His eyes met hers with unexpected intensity. ""There's something terrifying about that, isn't it? When you're untethered not because you have to be, but because you chose to let go?""

Sofia felt her breath catch slightly. She thought about her life in Milan ‚Äì the prestigious firm, the carefully maintained social circles, the five-year plan she'd mapped out before everything shifted six weeks ago. ""Terrifying,"" she agreed. ""But also...""

""Necessary?""

""I was going to say 'liberating,'"" she smiled but added more quietly, ""Even if I'm not quite sure what I'm liberating myself from.""

The train curved around a particularly steep bend, and they both instinctively reached out to steady their coffee cups. Their fingers brushed briefly, and neither pulled away immediately. The touch felt like a confession ‚Äì an acknowledgment of whatever was building between them in this liminal space between leaving and arriving.

Oskar looked down at their nearly touching hands, then back up at her. ""You know what's funny? I've recorded this exact route before. Munich to Venice. Different seasons, different times of day. But it's never sounded quite like this.""

Sofia felt the weight of what he wasn't saying and what they were dancing around. The growing awareness that sometimes the most significant moments in life happen in the transitional hours between one life and another.

The mountains were now giving way to gentler slopes, the Italian border approaching. Sofia realized she was checking the time less frequently as if ignoring it might slow their journey somehow. Her coffee had gone cold, but she kept her hands wrapped around the cup, preserving the moment.

""When's your connection in Venice?"" Oskar asked, his voice carefully casual as he packed away his recording device.

""Who says I have one?""

He smiled at that, but there was something nostalgic in it. ""Fair enough. I didn't exactly plan past buying a ticket myself.""

""Very Swedish of you, this spontaneity,"" Sofia teased, trying to lighten the growing weight of their remaining time.

""Says the Italian architect who's actually using her perfectly scheduled train ticket to not attend a meeting.""

""Touch√©."" She watched him coil his headphone cable with methodical precision. ""Although technically, I am meeting someone in Venice.""

His hands stilled for a moment. ""Ah.""

""My aunt,"" Sofia clarified quickly, then wondered why explaining was so important. ""She has this tiny restaurant near Campo Santa Margherita. Makes the best seafood risotto in Venice. I always stay with her when I need to..."" She gestured vaguely.

""Hide from perfectly reasonable ex-boyfriends?""

""Think,"" she corrected but smiled. ""Although the hiding part is a bonus."" She hesitated, then added, ""You should try it sometime. The risotto, I mean. If you're still in Venice tomorrow.""

The invitation hung between them, delicate as blown glass. Oskar looked at her for a long moment, and Sofia felt her heart speed up slightly.

""I'd like that,"" he said finally. ""If you're sure about mixing your thinking spot with..."" He gestured between them.

""My aunt would say that good risotto is meant for sharing with interesting strangers."" Sofia pulled out her phone, trying to project more confidence than she felt. ""I can write down the address‚Äî""

""Wait,"" Oskar said softly. The tone in his voice made her look up. He was gazing out the window, and his expression had changed. ""Listen.""

Sofia fell quiet, tuning into the sound of the train. They were descending now, the rhythm of the rails shifting, the mountain echoes fading into something softer, more musical.

""The sound's different here,"" he explained, reaching for his recording device again. ""Right where the German Alps become Italian valleys. Like the train itself knows it's crossing a border."" He pressed record, then looked at her. ""Some transitions you can only understand while they're happening.""

The afternoon sun slanted through the window, casting long shadows across their shared table. Sofia watched him listen, really looked at him ‚Äì this Swedish sound designer who understood spaces and transitions in ways she'd never considered, who was running toward uncertainty with the same strange mix of fear and hope that she felt.

""You're not really going to record sounds in Venice, are you?"" Sofia asked, watching him adjust levels on his device with unnecessary precision.

His hands stilled. A small smile played at the corner of his mouth, but he kept his eyes on the device. ""Probably not.""

""And I'm not really going to sketch buildings.""

""No?""

""Maybe just one."" She closed her sketchbook, which had been unused since their coffee. ""The sound studio in Munich. You know, in case you need an architect's perspective on those too-perfect acoustics.""

He looked up then, meeting her eyes. ""Would that be a professional consultation?""

""Probably not.""

The train's rhythm changed again as they entered the Veneto plain. The late afternoon light had turned golden, softening the edges of everything ‚Äì the distant mountains behind them, the approaching lagoon ahead, this strange space they'd created between leaving and arriving.

Oskar checked his phone for the first time since Munich. ""Two hours,"" he said quietly.

Sofia nodded, not needing to ask two hours until what. She could feel it, too ‚Äì the subtle shift in the air as their bubble of suspended time began to thin. Real life was seeping in at the edges: unopened emails, unanswered questions, decisions waiting to be made.

""You know,"" Oskar said, putting his phone away again, ""in game design, we spend a lot of time thinking about endings. How to make them feel both surprising and inevitable.""

""And what's the secret?""

""Usually?"" He leaned back, that half-smile returning. ""Leave something unresolved. Give players a reason to start another story.""

Sofia felt her cheeks warm slightly. ""Is that what this is? A story?""

""I don't know."" His voice was soft but steady. ""But I do know I'm not ready for it to end at the station.""

The train curved toward the coast, and suddenly the light changed completely ‚Äì water-reflected, distinctive, unmistakably Venice. They both turned to watch the lagoon appear, its surface glittering like scattered coins.

""My aunt's risotto is usually ready around eight,"" Sofia said, her heart beating slightly faster. ""But the campo is lovely earlier when the light's still like this.""

The familiar silhouette of Venice emerged across the lagoon ‚Äì bell towers and domes painted in late afternoon light. Sofia watched Oskar taking it in, his expression softening in recognition.

""What does Venice sound like to you now?"" she asked. ""Different from your previous recordings?""

He tilted his head, considering. ""Every time I come here, it sounds new somehow."" Then he smiled, that one-sided dimple appearing. ""Want to help me figure out why?""



The train was slowing now, crossing the bridge to the island. Other passengers had started gathering their belongings, checking tickets, and making calls. But Sofia and Oskar remained seated, their temporary world still intact for these final moments.

""I should warn you,"" Sofia said, finally reaching for her bag, ""Venice has a way of making people lose track of time. Especially around Campo Santa Margherita.""

""Is that a warning or a promise?""

Before she could answer, the train entered the final tunnel before Santa Lucia station. In the sudden darkness, their reflections appeared again in the window ‚Äì closer now than they'd been in Munich, both turned slightly toward each other. The station platform was already visible ahead when they emerged into the light.

""I have a confession,"" Oskar said, reaching for his backpack. ""I actually do need to record one sound in Venice.""

""Oh?""

""The exact moment a Swedish sound designer falls in love with Italian architecture."" He paused, then added with deliberate lightness, ""The acoustics, I mean.""

Sofia felt warmth spread through her chest. ""That's very specific.""

""I like to be thorough in my work.""

The train was pulling into the station now, their shared journey officially ending. Around them, passengers were already pushing toward the exits. But Sofia moved slower, watching Oskar gather his things with the same careful precision he'd shown with his recordings.

""Campo Santa Margherita,"" she said, pulling out her phone. ""Let me give you the exact address‚Äî""

""Actually,"" he interrupted gently, ""maybe don't.""

She looked up, surprised and slightly hurt, until she saw his expression.

""I mean,"" he continued, ""Venice is full of lovely squares. Maybe I'll just have to check them all until I find the one with the best risotto and the most interesting architect.""

Sofia felt a smile tugging at her lips. ""That could take hours.""

""I hope so."" He shouldered his backpack, then gestured toward the door with an exaggerated formality. ""After you. Unless you're planning to stay on until Milan?""

""God no,"" she laughed, standing. ""I hear the acoustics there are terrible right now.""

Venice's late afternoon light spilled through the windows onto the platform, warm, golden, and full of possibility. The same light that had illuminated countless arrivals and departures, endings and beginnings. Sofia thought about morning light in Munich, about too-perfect acoustics and transitional spaces, about how sometimes the best decisions aren't decisions at all but simply moments of letting go.

They stepped onto the platform and instantly swept into the familiar chaos of Santa Lucia station ‚Äì the clatter of wheeled suitcases, the multilingual chatter, the echoing announcements that remained unclear in three languages.

Oskar reached for his recording device one last time, but stopped halfway. ""You know what? Maybe some sounds are better just... experienced.""

Sofia watched him tuck the device away, understanding the small surrender in the gesture. She shouldered her bag, hyper-aware of how close they were standing now, with no table between them.

""So,"" she said, ""which campo are you going to check first?""

He pretended to consider this seriously. ""Well, logically, I should start from the furthest and work my way‚Äî""

""That's the worst possible route.""

""‚Äîbut I hear the light is particularly nice in Santa Margherita this time of day.""

""Pure coincidence.""

""Purely."" That half-smile again, but fuller now, more confident. ""Though I might need an architect's opinion on the square's acoustic properties.""

Around them, their fellow passengers were dispersing into Venice's maze of possibilities. The station clock showed 5:47. The October sun would hang low over the canal for another hour at least, painting the water in shades of amber and gold.

Sofia stepped toward the station exit and then looked back at Oskar. ""Coming?""

He fell into step beside her, their shoulders almost touching. As they walked through the station's grand archway, the sounds of Venice washed over them ‚Äì water lapping against stone, boats humming in the distance, the peculiar echo of footsteps in narrow streets ahead.

""Listen,"" Oskar said softly.

Sofia did. And somehow, even though she'd heard these same sounds a thousand times before, they seemed to carry a different note today. Something that sounded a lot like a beginning.

The AI was tasked with rating and critiquing the desk setups of the Tom's Guide editors, and the results were both amusing and insightful. 

As I watched Grok analyze the various setups, I couldn't help but think about how our workspaces often reflect our personalities and work habits. Some editors had meticulously organized desks, showcasing a sense of order and productivity. Others, however, had a more chaotic vibe, filled with gadgets and coffee cups that hinted at a creative, albeit cluttered, approach to work.

What stood out to me was Grok's candid feedback. It didn‚Äôt hold back, pointing out everything from poor cable management to questionable decor choices. This made me realize how important it is to curate our work environments thoughtfully. A well-designed workspace can enhance focus and creativity, while a messy one might hinder productivity.

I found myself reflecting on my own desk setup. Is it time for a little spring cleaning or a complete redesign? The engagement and humor from Grok‚Äôs responses added a layer of entertainment to what could have been a mundane task. 

Overall, this experience with Grok not only showcased AI's capabilities but also sparked a fun conversation about the personal and professional significance of our workspaces. How does your desk setup reflect who you are?",1,1731840335.0,hacksguider,0,1.0,False

1gtaycv,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1gtaycv/i_cant_forgive_myself_for_treating_my_bf_badly/,I can't forgive myself for treating my bf badly,"I've been with my boyfriend for 3,5 years. We're both 25 now. Four months ago, when I graduated, I hit a crisis and suddenly started recalling our entire relationship and the mistakes I made. The problem is, we've already had many conversations and reached conclusions about every situation, but I can't forgive myself, and I can't plan a future with him in this state. I cry every day and feel overwhelming sadness.

The first thing that bothers me is the drama I caused. In the last two years, there haven't been many, maybe 10 arguments a year. The drama happened over a six-month period when I was struggling with a very difficult subject at university, and I wasn't doing well. Once, I even tore up an entire notebook. I constantly dragged him into my university struggles when I should have kept that separate. After that subject, it continued through the summer; I failed another subject and had to retake it. When I failed, I was so angry that I told him to cancel our vacation. I wanted everything to fall apart for him too because I was miserable. That lasted one day. We were both at our hometowns, and I would frequently start drama through messages. He was working all day for an american company as an engineering manager, and I would bombard him with messages, often writing illogical things. I was very childish. When he said he couldn‚Äôt come for the weekend, I would write, ‚ÄúFine, then don‚Äôt come at all.‚Äù A few times, I wrote, ‚ÄúGo to hell and die.‚Äù All of this happened during that six-month period. It didn‚Äôt happen afterward, nor was it happening before that.

The next thing that bothers me is not telling him private things. We never had deep conversations about the past, and that‚Äôs what held me back from agreeing to a relationship in the beginning. At home, we live in a very small apartment, 37m2, and I share a room with my brother. I was ashamed of that and never told him. I didn‚Äôt open up about my problems at all. We didn‚Äôt have much money before; elementary school was hard for me because I have alopecia and no hair, my brother was unemployed for a long time, and some little things. These are all things we never talked about, and I regret not opening up sooner. When I told him about my hair before the relationship, he never asked me anything about it. He said he doesn‚Äôt like putting people in awkward situations and that the past doesn‚Äôt matter to him, so he didn‚Äôt think to ask. When I finally told him all those things, he said he had nothing to say.

The next thing that bothers me is the beginning of our relationship. We met on October 25th and saw each other one more time before I went home for two weeks. During those two weeks, I was texting another guy I didn‚Äôt know in person, and I really liked him online. When I came back to the city where I was studying, I went for coffee with that guy, and I didn‚Äôt like him. After that, I fell in love with my current boyfriend. That was on November 19th. I know I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad about it, but I constantly feel guilty for not knowing right away that he was ‚Äúthe one.‚Äù I told him how I felt on December 1st, but then we went home for a month and a half, and that was still during COVID.

The next thing I regret is waiting for sex. Our first kiss was on February 26th, our official relationship date was March 27th, and sex happened in September. Before that, we did everything else‚Äîrubbing without clothes, oral, hands, and a few times, he partially went inside, but just the tip. However, full PIV sex wasn‚Äôt until September. The worst part about it was that I always had to have control. I was constantly obsessed with those dates‚Äîwhen we‚Äôd officially be in a relationship, the perfect day for the first time, etc.

The last thing that bothers me is going out to clubs. My friends often pressured me, and I gave in. I didn‚Äôt have a strong sense of self. It happened about 6-8 times a year. But I never got drunk. I regret going out sometimes when I didn‚Äôt feel like it. I should have prioritized him.",3,1731840094.0,self,11,0.67,False

1gtawsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/FictionWriting/comments/1gtawsm/acoustic_shadows/,Acoustic Shadows,"""Eurocity 86, M√ºnchen Hauptbahnhof nach Venezia Santa Lucia, Abfahrt von Gleis 12."" The announcement echoed through Munich's central station, first in German, then Italian, and finally in English. Sofia wheeled her carry-on down Platform 12, past windows reflecting the early October sun. She rechecked her ticket: Car 24, Seat 65, window.¬†

The carriage was empty except for a few early passengers settling in with books and laptops. She hoisted her bag into the overhead rack and methodically arranged her essentials‚Äîtablet,¬† sketchbook, coffee from the station cafe‚Äîon the pull-down table‚Äîa creature of habit, even when running away. The seat across from her remained empty as other passengers filed past. Three minutes to departure. Sofia uncapped her coffee, inhaling the familiar comfort of robusta beans that weren't entirely Italian. She had just pulled out her tablet when movement in her peripheral vision made her glance up.

A tall figure paused by her table, checking his ticket with a slight frown. His olive backpack looked well-traveled, and a pair of professional headphones hung around his neck.¬†

""Excuse me,"" he said in careful German, pointing to the seat across from her. ""I think I'm‚Äî""

""Achtundsechzig?"" Sofia asked, gesturing to the window seat opposite, proud of remembering the German number from her ticket-checking moments ago.

He nodded, looking relieved. As he stored his backpack overhead, Sofia noticed how his sweater sleeves were pushed up to the elbows, revealing a simple watch on one wrist and what looked like a festival band on the other. He settled into his seat just as the train lurched gently into motion.

The departure announcement crackled through the train car, first in German, then Italian, followed by what was presumably meant to be English. Sofia caught something about a delayed lunch service in the Italian version, while the German announcement seemed to be apologizing for the air conditioning. The English translation confidently declared that passengers would "" embrace their warm fellowship during this journey.""

She couldn't help the small laugh that escaped her, quickly covering it with a cough. Across the table, the man looked up from where he'd been fiddling with what appeared to be a small recording device. He made a similar sound of amusement, poorly disguised as clearing his throat.¬†

When their eyes met, he gestured vaguely at the speaker overhead and attempted, in careful German, ""Das war... interessant?""

Sofia straightened, relieved to have someone to share the moment with, and responded in her best German, ""Ja, sehr..."" she paused, searching for the word, then simply made a confused face and waved her hands.

He laughed ‚Äì a genuine one this time ‚Äì and his relief was palpable when he asked, ""English?""

""Oh, thank god,"" Sofia said, her laugh more relaxed now. ""My German stops at ordering coffee and apologizing.""

""Same. I just wasted three months of Duolingo on one terrible sentence."" His English carried a distinct Scandinavian lilt.¬†

He extended his hand across their shared table. ""Oskar.

""Sofia."" His hand was warm, the handshake brief but firm.¬†

She again noticed the headphones around his neck, the kind audio professionals used. The morning light caught the metal details of the ear cups, which were definitely expensive ones.

They settled into a comfortable silence as Munich's outskirts blurred past the window. Sofia pulled out her tablet, then found herself distracted by Oskar setting up what looked like a small recording device on the window ledge. When he caught her looking, he seemed slightly embarrassed.

""Work,"" he explained, though something in his tone suggested otherwise. ""The train sounds, they're, uh... interesting.""

Sofia nodded, not entirely convinced but charmed by what seemed like an excuse as flimsy as her own 'client meeting' in Venice. She turned to the window, watching the city fade into the countryside, aware of his presence in a way that made her simultaneously want to start another conversation and pretend to be completely absorbed in her work.

The train curved, and morning sunlight swept across their table. They both reached to adjust their screens against the glare, their hands almost colliding.¬†

""Sorry,"" they said in unison, then shared another laugh, smaller this time, more uncertain.

Sofia tucked a strand of hair behind her ear and returned to her tablet, pulling up the client brief she'd only half-read before boarding. But the words blurred as she listened to the train's rhythm, wondering why and if that's what he was recording.

Her ""Deep Focus"" Spotify playlist ‚Äì usually reliable for drowning out distractions ‚Äì wasn't doing its job. Three lo-fi songs in, and she'd retained nothing of the client brief on her screen. The ambient music that generally helped her through deadline nights in Milan felt pointless here. Instead, her attention kept drifting to the gentle click of Oskar's keyboard as he worked and the way he occasionally tilted his head, listening to something through one side of his headphones while letting the other ear stay free.

Outside, Munich's suburbs had given way to the Bavarian countryside. Sofia had taken this route before, but always on overnight trains, too focused on work to notice the landscape. But with the morning light playing across distant peaks, she reached for her sketchbook instead of her tablet.

""They get better,"" Oskar said suddenly.

Sofia pulled out an earbud. ""I‚Äôm sorry?""

He nodded toward the window. ""The mountains. About twenty minutes from now, they're...""

He paused and seemed to search for the right word. ""Overwhelming? In a good way.""

""You've done this journey before?""

""A few times. Different seasons."" He adjusted his recording device slightly.¬†

""The train sounds different in tunnels during summer than winter. More echo when it's cold."" He caught himself and looked almost embarrassed.¬†

""Sorry, occupational hazard. I notice weird things.""

""No, that's interesting."" Sofia closed her tablet cover.¬†

""Like how buildings sound different, too. Empty ones versus lived-in ones.""

His eyes lit up. ""Exactly. Most people think of spaces visually, but‚Äî""

The train entered a tunnel, and their table suddenly reflected their faces in the darkened window. They both straightened slightly, caught in this unexpected mirror. When they emerged back into the sunlight, Sofia wasn‚Äôt sketching the mountains but the curved ceiling of the train car, adding notes about acoustics in the margins.

""Coffee?"" Oskar asked after a while, starting to stand. ""I think I saw a cart going through the next car.""

""Sure, thanks."" Sofia reached for her bag, but he waved it off.

""I've got it. Unless you don't trust a stranger's coffee choices?""

She smiled. ""Surprise me. Just‚Äî""

""Let me guess,"" he interrupted, a glint in his eye.¬†

""No milk after eleven AM and heaven forbid any flavored syrups?""

""Am I that obviously Italian?""

""Says the woman who's been wincing at her station coffee for the past hour."" He grinned, and Sofia felt something flutter in her chest. A dimple appeared when he smiled like that, just on one side.

While he was gone, she looked at his abandoned headphones on the table, expensive yet worn in a way that suggested daily use. His laptop screen had gone dark, but a sticker on its cover caught her eye‚Äîthe logo of a gaming studio she recognized from her nephew's endless chatter about virtual worlds.

The coffee cart's wheels squeaked somewhere nearby, and Sofia quickly looked back to her sketchbook, not wanting to be caught examining his things. But her pencil moved aimlessly, no longer focused on architecture. Instead, she wondered what kind of person records train sounds and makes jokes about coffee customs, yet seems to be running away from something just like she is.

Oskar returned with two cups and a conspiratorial expression.

¬†""The coffee cart lady? Definitely from somewhere near Milano. We had a whole conversation about proper espresso while she judged my Swedish accent.""

""Oh no."" Sofia laughed.¬†

""Did she give you the speech about how Germans ruin coffee?""

""Better. She offered to adopt me and teach me 'the proper way' to drink it."" He set one cup in front of her.¬†

""Fair warning though‚ÄîI think she made yours extra strong out of patriotic duty.""

Their fingers brushed as she accepted the cup, and this time, neither pulled away quite as quickly as politeness required. Sofia wrapped her hands around the cup, inhaling deeply.¬†

""Ah, she used the emergency espresso stash. They don't serve this to regular passengers.""

""Emergency espresso?"" Oskar raised an eyebrow, and his one-sided dimple appeared again.

""Every Italian train attendant has one. It's like a cultural obligation."" She took a sip and sighed contently.¬†

""Though I'm curious how you charmed it out of her. We're usually very protective of the good coffee.""

""I might have mentioned I was reading Elena Ferrante in Swedish translation."" He pulled a worn paperback from his laptop bag, its spine creased with use. ""It was either going to win her over or deeply offend her.""

Sofia laughed. ""Bold strategy. My nonna would either try to feed you or lecture you about reading it in 'some Viking language.'"" She caught herself, surprised by how easily the personal detail had slipped out. She didn't usually talk about her grandmother with strangers.

""Viking language?"" His eyes crinkled with amusement as he took a sip of his coffee. ""Should I be offended on behalf of Sweden?""

""Says the man who probably thinks all Italian coffee is the same.""

""Not anymore. The coffee cart lady gave me a detailed education about the regional differences."" He leaned forward slightly. ""Though I did zone out somewhere around the proper water temperature for beans from Sicily versus Tuscany.""

A notification pinged on his laptop. Oskar glanced at it, and something flickered across his face ‚Äì a shadow of whatever he was traveling away from, Sofia guessed. She recognized that look; she'd seen it in her reflection enough lately.

""So,"" she said, deliberately keeping her tone light, ""what does a Swedish..."" she paused, realizing they hadn't exchanged that information yet.

""Sound designer,"" he supplied, seeming grateful for the redirect. ""For games, mostly. Though right now I'm..."" he made a vague gesture with his coffee cup, ""between projects.""

Sofia nodded, understanding the weight of those unsaid words.¬†

""Between projects"" felt like the professional equivalent of her own ""just need a change of scenery"" explanation for this trip.

The train began to climb more steeply, and the morning light shifted, throwing geometric patterns across their table. Sofia reached for her phone, switching to the camera app with practiced ease.

""Sorry, work habit,"" she murmured, angling her phone to capture the interplay of light and shadow across the white table surface. ""The way these angles intersect..."" She took three quick shots, each from a slightly different position.

""No, please,"" Oskar said, pulling back his coffee cup to give her a better frame.

Something in his voice made her look up. He watched her with curious interest, that half-smile playing at his lips again.¬†

""You're cataloging visual inspiration. I do the same thing with sounds.""

Sofia smiled back. ""And here I was trying to be subtle about documenting everything.""

""Says the woman photographing a train table.""

""Says the man recording the sound of mountain tunnels.""

His recording device let out a soft beep then, and they both turned to watch as the train rounded a bend. The view transformed dramatically ‚Äì sheer cliffs rising on one side, a vast valley opening up on the other, and morning mist clinging to distant peaks. Sofia lowered her phone, no longer interested in geometric patterns.

""Overwhelming?"" she asked, echoing his earlier description.

""Ja,"" he answered softly, forgetting to speak English for a moment.¬†

They sat in companionable silence, watching the landscape unfold. The coffee cart's wheels squeaked somewhere in the distance, and a toddler in the next car let out a delighted laugh at the view, but these sounds seemed to exist in another world entirely. Stealing glances at Oskar's profile as he gazed out the window, Sofia noted how the tension he'd carried earlier had eased somewhat. She wondered if she looked equally different now, equally far from the woman who had boarded the train in Munich with her carefully constructed explanations.

""I've always wondered,"" Oskar said, breaking their comfortable silence, ""what architects listen to when they design."" He gestured to her earbuds, still dangling unused over her tablet. ""Other than lo-fi study playlists.""

Sofia laughed, caught off-guard by his observation of her Spotify screen earlier.¬†

""Depends on the project. Sometimes silence. Sometimes, whatever matches the space's intended emotion."" She paused, considering. ""I once designed an entire yoga studio listening to nothing but rainfall sounds.""

""And did it work? Did the space feel like rain?""

""Actually, yes. The client said it felt... fluid. Meditative."" She tilted her head, studying him. ""But you already knew that would work, didn't you? The connection between sound and spatial feeling.""

His smile turned thoughtful.¬†

""It's what I love about sound design. In games, we're not just creating noise ‚Äì we're building atmosphere, emotion, memory.""

""It's like that with buildings too,"" Sofia said, warming to the topic. ""Every space holds emotional imprints. When I design, I'm not just thinking about walls and windows ‚Äì I'm thinking about how morning light might make someone feel hopeful or how the right ceiling height can make a room feel safe rather than imposing."" She traced a finger along the window frame. ""Architecture is really just emotional memory made tangible.""

""That's exactly it."" Oskar leaned forward, animated now. ""Sound works the same way. Like... you know that feeling when you hear rain on a tin roof? It's not just water-hitting metal. It's every childhood afternoon spent reading in bed, every lazy Sunday morning, every cozy moment of feeling sheltered while the world does its thing outside."" He gestured to his recording device. ""That's what I'm always chasing ‚Äì those sound memories that live in our bones.""

The train entered a tunnel, the window suddenly mirror-black, their reflections overlapping in the glass. When they emerged back into the sunlight, the landscape had changed again ‚Äì stark rock faces giving way to gentler slopes dotted with tiny houses that looked like scattered dice from this height.

Sofia watched Oskar as he adjusted his recording levels. There was something compelling about someone who understood space and emotion from such a different angle than her own. When he glanced up and caught her looking, neither of them immediately looked away.

A message notification lit up her phone screen. Marco's name appeared briefly before she flipped the phone face-down, but not quickly enough. She saw Oskar notice and saw him choose not to ask. The comfortable intimacy of their conversation wavered, and suddenly, the real reasons for their journeys felt too close to ignore.

The notification had shifted something in the air between them. Sofia watched the Alpine landscape blur past, aware of how her phone sat between them like a small dark confession.¬†

""I was offered my dream job in Munich yesterday,"" Oskar said suddenly, his voice quiet but clear against the train's rhythm. ""Lead sound designer for Avalanche Studios. The kind of role I've been working toward for years."" He paused, fidgeting with his recording device. ""They want an answer by Monday.""

Sofia turned from the window to study his profile. ""But you're not sure?""

""That's just it - I am sure. It's perfect. Almost too perfect."" He ran a hand through his hair, messing it up slightly. ""And instead of celebrating or calling my parents, I bought a ticket to Venice. Just... needed some space to think."" He gestured at his recording device with a self-deprecating smile. ""Figured capturing some new sounds might help clear my head.""

""From what?""

""From everyone else's certainty, I guess. My friends all say I'd be crazy not to take it. They're probably right."" His fingers drummed lightly on the table. ""But it's not just a job, is it? It's a whole life. Living in Munich, being that person, making those choices..."" He trailed off, then added quietly, ""I just need to know I'm saying yes because I want to, not because I'm supposed to.""

The honesty in his voice made something shift in Sofia's chest. She glanced at her phone again, then decisively tucked it into her bag.

""I have a client meeting in Venice,"" she said, the words coming easier than expected. ""Except I don't. I mean, I did, but I canceled it yesterday. I just... kept the train ticket."" She took a breath. ""My ex-boyfriend is taking over the Milan project I've spent two years on. A cultural center that was supposed to be my breakthrough design. He's probably in my office right now, reviewing my plans, suggesting improvements, being perfectly reasonable about everything while our entire social circle pretends this isn't incredibly weird.""

""When did you break up?""

""Six weeks ago. But the project handover meeting is today."" She laughed, but it came out slightly hollow. ""Hence the sudden urgent need to discuss hypothetical renovations with a hypothetical client in Venice.""

Oskar nodded slowly. ""So we're both running away.""

""I prefer to think of it as a strategic retreat.""

""Into art and architecture?""

""Says the man recording train sounds 'for inspiration.'""

His half-smile returned, warming his eyes. ""Touch√©.""¬†

The train entered a tunnel, the window suddenly mirror-black, their reflections overlapping in the glass. When they emerged back into the sunlight, the landscape had changed again ‚Äì stark rock faces giving way to gentler slopes dotted with tiny houses that looked like scattered dice from this height.

""It's strange,"" Oskar said, adjusting his recording device. ""I spend my life creating soundscapes that help players feel grounded in virtual worlds, but lately..."" He trailed off, watching the mountains drift by.

""But lately, you feel disconnected from your own?"" Sofia suggested quietly, recognizing something in his hesitation.

He looked at her, surprised. ""Yeah. Exactly. Like I'm somehow between soundtracks.""

""We have a term in architecture ‚Äì 'transitional spaces.' They're meant to help people move between different environments, different states of being."" She traced a finger along the window frame. ""Though lately, I feel like I'm stuck in one.""

Their eyes met, and Sofia felt that flutter in her chest again, stronger this time. The train began its descent through the Brenner Pass, and the late morning sun caught Oskar's profile, softening the determined set of his jaw. She wondered if he was thinking, as she was, about how strange it was to feel so understood by a stranger on a train.

""Can I ask you something?"" Sofia said, surprising herself with the question.

""Sure.""

""What does Munich sound like? To you, I mean. As a sound designer.""

Oskar's hand stilled on his recording device. He just watched the mountains slide past for a moment as if listening to something in his memory.

""It's..."" he started, then stopped. Tried again. ""The city has this constant low hum. Not unpleasant, just... relentless. Like it's always breathing in but never quite breathing out."" His fingers tapped an unconscious rhythm on the table. ""The studio is in this beautiful historic building, all high ceilings and modern art. But the acoustics are too perfect, you know? Too controlled. Even the coffee machine sounds exactly the same every morning.""

He caught himself, almost embarrassed by the revelation hidden in his critique. ""That probably sounds ridiculous.""

""No,"" Sofia said softly, recognizing the same uncertainty she felt about Milan in his description of Munich's too-perfect sounds. ""It sounds like a place waiting for you to fit into it instead of making space for who you are.""

The train emerged from a tunnel, sunlight flooding their compartment. Oskar's recording device beeped softly, capturing the transition from enclosed echo to open air.

""That's exactly it,"" he said, looking at her with a mix of surprise and relief. ""Unmoored. That's the word I've been avoiding all morning.""

""Drifting?"" Sofia offered.

""By choice, though."" His eyes met hers with unexpected intensity. ""There's something terrifying about that, isn't it? When you're untethered not because you have to be, but because you chose to let go?""

Sofia felt her breath catch slightly. She thought about her life in Milan ‚Äì the prestigious firm, the carefully maintained social circles, the five-year plan she'd mapped out before everything shifted six weeks ago. ""Terrifying,"" she agreed. ""But also...""

""Necessary?""

""I was going to say 'liberating,'"" she smiled but added more quietly, ""Even if I'm not quite sure what I'm liberating myself from.""

The train curved around a particularly steep bend, and they both instinctively reached out to steady their coffee cups. Their fingers brushed briefly, and neither pulled away immediately. The touch felt like a confession ‚Äì an acknowledgment of whatever was building between them in this liminal space between leaving and arriving.

Oskar looked down at their nearly touching hands, then back up at her. ""You know what's funny? I've recorded this exact route before. Munich to Venice. Different seasons, different times of day. But it's never sounded quite like this.""

Sofia felt the weight of what he wasn't saying and what they were dancing around. The growing awareness that sometimes the most significant moments in life happen in the transitional hours between one life and another.

The mountains were now giving way to gentler slopes, the Italian border approaching. Sofia realized she was checking the time less frequently as if ignoring it might slow their journey somehow. Her coffee had gone cold, but she kept her hands wrapped around the cup, preserving the moment.

""When's your connection in Venice?"" Oskar asked, his voice carefully casual as he packed away his recording device.

""Who says I have one?""

He smiled at that, but there was something nostalgic in it. ""Fair enough. I didn't exactly plan past buying a ticket myself.""

""Very Swedish of you, this spontaneity,"" Sofia teased, trying to lighten the growing weight of their remaining time.

""Says the Italian architect who's actually using her perfectly scheduled train ticket to not attend a meeting.""

""Touch√©."" She watched him coil his headphone cable with methodical precision. ""Although technically, I am meeting someone in Venice.""

His hands stilled for a moment. ""Ah.""

""My aunt,"" Sofia clarified quickly, then wondered why explaining was so important. ""She has this tiny restaurant near Campo Santa Margherita. Makes the best seafood risotto in Venice. I always stay with her when I need to..."" She gestured vaguely.

""Hide from perfectly reasonable ex-boyfriends?""

""Think,"" she corrected but smiled. ""Although the hiding part is a bonus."" She hesitated, then added, ""You should try it sometime. The risotto, I mean. If you're still in Venice tomorrow.""

The invitation hung between them, delicate as blown glass. Oskar looked at her for a long moment, and Sofia felt her heart speed up slightly.

""I'd like that,"" he said finally. ""If you're sure about mixing your thinking spot with..."" He gestured between them.

""My aunt would say that good risotto is meant for sharing with interesting strangers."" Sofia pulled out her phone, trying to project more confidence than she felt. ""I can write down the address‚Äî""

""Wait,"" Oskar said softly. The tone in his voice made her look up. He was gazing out the window, and his expression had changed. ""Listen.""

Sofia fell quiet, tuning into the sound of the train. They were descending now, the rhythm of the rails shifting, the mountain echoes fading into something softer, more musical.

""The sound's different here,"" he explained, reaching for his recording device again. ""Right where the German Alps become Italian valleys. Like the train itself knows it's crossing a border."" He pressed record, then looked at her. ""Some transitions you can only understand while they're happening.""

The afternoon sun slanted through the window, casting long shadows across their shared table. Sofia watched him listen, really looked at him ‚Äì this Swedish sound designer who understood spaces and transitions in ways she'd never considered, who was running toward uncertainty with the same strange mix of fear and hope that she felt.

""You're not really going to record sounds in Venice, are you?"" Sofia asked, watching him adjust levels on his device with unnecessary precision.

His hands stilled. A small smile played at the corner of his mouth, but he kept his eyes on the device. ""Probably not.""

""And I'm not really going to sketch buildings.""

""No?""

""Maybe just one."" She closed her sketchbook, which had been unused since their coffee. ""The sound studio in Munich. You know, in case you need an architect's perspective on those too-perfect acoustics.""

He looked up then, meeting her eyes. ""Would that be a professional consultation?""

""Probably not.""

The train's rhythm changed again as they entered the Veneto plain. The late afternoon light had turned golden, softening the edges of everything ‚Äì the distant mountains behind them, the approaching lagoon ahead, this strange space they'd created between leaving and arriving.

Oskar checked his phone for the first time since Munich. ""Two hours,"" he said quietly.

Sofia nodded, not needing to ask two hours until what. She could feel it, too ‚Äì the subtle shift in the air as their bubble of suspended time began to thin. Real life was seeping in at the edges: unopened emails, unanswered questions, decisions waiting to be made.

""You know,"" Oskar said, putting his phone away again, ""in game design, we spend a lot of time thinking about endings. How to make them feel both surprising and inevitable.""

""And what's the secret?""

""Usually?"" He leaned back, that half-smile returning. ""Leave something unresolved. Give players a reason to start another story.""

Sofia felt her cheeks warm slightly. ""Is that what this is? A story?""

""I don't know."" His voice was soft but steady. ""But I do know I'm not ready for it to end at the station.""

The train curved toward the coast, and suddenly the light changed completely ‚Äì water-reflected, distinctive, unmistakably Venice. They both turned to watch the lagoon appear, its surface glittering like scattered coins.

""My aunt's risotto is usually ready around eight,"" Sofia said, her heart beating slightly faster. ""But the campo is lovely earlier when the light's still like this.""

The familiar silhouette of Venice emerged across the lagoon ‚Äì bell towers and domes painted in late afternoon light. Sofia watched Oskar taking it in, his expression softening in recognition.

""What does Venice sound like to you now?"" she asked. ""Different from your previous recordings?""

He tilted his head, considering. ""Every time I come here, it sounds new somehow."" Then he smiled, that one-sided dimple appearing. ""Want to help me figure out why?""

The train was slowing now, crossing the bridge to the island. Other passengers had started gathering their belongings, checking tickets, and making calls. But Sofia and Oskar remained seated, their temporary world still intact for these final moments.

""I should warn you,"" Sofia said, finally reaching for her bag, ""Venice has a way of making people lose track of time. Especially around Campo Santa Margherita.""

""Is that a warning or a promise?""

Before she could answer, the train entered the final tunnel before Santa Lucia station. In the sudden darkness, their reflections appeared again in the window ‚Äì closer now than they'd been in Munich, both turned slightly toward each other. The station platform was already visible ahead when they emerged into the light.

""I have a confession,"" Oskar said, reaching for his backpack. ""I actually do need to record one sound in Venice.""

""Oh?""

""The exact moment a Swedish sound designer falls in love with Italian architecture."" He paused, then added with deliberate lightness, ""The acoustics, I mean.""

Sofia felt warmth spread through her chest. ""That's very specific.""

""I like to be thorough in my work.""

The train was pulling into the station now, their shared journey officially ending. Around them, passengers were already pushing toward the exits. But Sofia moved slower, watching Oskar gather his things with the same careful precision he'd shown with his recordings.

""Campo Santa Margherita,"" she said, pulling out her phone. ""Let me give you the exact address‚Äî""

""Actually,"" he interrupted gently, ""maybe don't.""

She looked up, surprised and slightly hurt, until she saw his expression.

""I mean,"" he continued, ""Venice is full of lovely squares. Maybe I'll just have to check them all until I find the one with the best risotto and the most interesting architect.""

Sofia felt a smile tugging at her lips. ""That could take hours.""

""I hope so."" He shouldered his backpack, then gestured toward the door with an exaggerated formality. ""After you. Unless you're planning to stay on until Milan?""

""God no,"" she laughed, standing. ""I hear the acoustics there are terrible right now.""

Venice's late afternoon light spilled through the windows onto the platform, warm, golden, and full of possibility. The same light that had illuminated countless arrivals and departures, endings and beginnings. Sofia thought about morning light in Munich, about too-perfect acoustics and transitional spaces, about how sometimes the best decisions aren't decisions at all but simply moments of letting go.

They stepped onto the platform and instantly swept into the familiar chaos of Santa Lucia station ‚Äì the clatter of wheeled suitcases, the multilingual chatter, the echoing announcements that remained unclear in three languages.

Oskar reached for his recording device one last time, but stopped halfway. ""You know what? Maybe some sounds are better just... experienced.""

Sofia watched him tuck the device away, understanding the small surrender in the gesture. She shouldered her bag, hyper-aware of how close they were standing now, with no table between them.

""So,"" she said, ""which campo are you going to check first?""

He pretended to consider this seriously. ""Well, logically, I should start from the furthest and work my way‚Äî""

""That's the worst possible route.""

""‚Äîbut I hear the light is particularly nice in Santa Margherita this time of day.""

""Pure coincidence.""

""Purely."" That half-smile again, but fuller now, more confident. ""Though I might need an architect's opinion on the square's acoustic properties.""

Around them, their fellow passengers were dispersing into Venice's maze of possibilities. The station clock showed 5:47. The October sun would hang low over the canal for another hour at least, painting the water in shades of amber and gold.

Sofia stepped toward the station exit and then looked back at Oskar. ""Coming?""

He fell into step beside her, their shoulders almost touching. As they walked through the station's grand archway, the sounds of Venice washed over them ‚Äì water lapping against stone, boats humming in the distance, the peculiar echo of footsteps in narrow streets ahead.

""Listen,"" Oskar said softly.

Sofia did. And somehow, even though she'd heard these same sounds a thousand times before, they seemed to carry a different note today. Something that sounded a lot like a beginning.",1,1731839892.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False

I started brewing espresso few months ago, with the nonplus Bambino, 2 spouts portafilter, IMS 16g basket.. 1zpresso j-ultra grinder.
So far the coffee I brewed has been very good, I prefer darker roasts so all was OK.
Now the shocking facts. I cannot make the coffee warmer than 55,  max 60C. I preheat the portafilter in boiling water, preheat fat espresso cups etc...
Then I read all the stuff about testing and discovering that the temperature is reached only when the flow is slow... So I tried using original plastic portafilter with the pressurized basket... And voila, the coffee was undrinkable but had 65C.
What is your espresso temperature from the Bambino and aftermarket portafilter?",1,1731839498.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1gtasil,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1gtasil/wasted_five_years_of_my_life_on_a_toxic/,Wasted five years of my life on a toxic relationship ,"I 23f have been with my now ex 26m for 5 years. He was the best at first he helped me leave my abusive family and the first year living together was just perfect, until he stopped working and I had to take on the financial responsibilities of two people in a very expensive city for 3 years while he was trying to discover what he wanted to do in life.
He would start trainings or new jobs and would quit after a week or two every time, and it was always someone else's fault never he's. Things started to get better after I threatened to leave him a dozen times and he actually managed to keep a job for few months.

It's Important to note that we are both immigrants  in a European country, he comes from a another European country and I'm north African.

Well he's mom opened a restaurant and offered him a job so we decided to move to her city. Before we go we had a talk to make sure everything goes well, I wanted to go back to school and would do it with an internship while he worked with his mom, we also agreed to keep our arguments and fights to ourselves like we always did.

Well non of it went as planed, at first it was good, and I was helping at least 2-3 days a week ( for free) in the restaurant until I find a internship and start school, while doing all the house work which I didn't mind since he was working a lot more then me.

Couple weeks later he started started saying really weird things and getting mad for no reason,  At first It was the fact that I don't wake up before him to make him coffee( which we never did for each other before), or the fact that I should come to the restaurant more often because his family will think that I don't like them.
His mom even took me aside to tell me that a women should take care of her husband ( like wtf!!!), and then there was the constant comments about people of my ethnicity and how most of us are uneducated and can't use spoons and don't adapt to European culture, but I'm great because I'm different....just a lot of shit, but my boyfriend would blame it on the fact that his mom grew up in a village where they were very close minded, and that she loves me so she can't be racist.
My breaking point was when we were at the dinner table with his mom and step dad and he started saying that he wanted a baby and all he's friends already had some of their own, even though we already spoke about this and I already told him that I won't have one until we are financially capable and own at least an appartement, he then got mad and stormed out.

Few days and a lot of weird situation later we had a big fight and he told me that he feels like he's dating a 40 years old who is always tired and he can easily find someone better if he wanted to, and that he don't know how long he can take being with someone like me ( he does this every time we fight).
It was like a light bulb lit in my head and decided that I won't take it anymore and I said okay let break up and took my things and left.

For some reason and for the first time in my life the universe is on my side, the director of the company I worked at as a receptionist for years before leaving contacted me to see how I was doing and when I told her that I was looking for internship she offered me one and I managed to find a room to rent and now I'm writing this in the train on my way the so I can start next week.

I haven't cried or got mad, I kind of feel empty inside but excited for this new chapter of my life.
My friend says that I must be in shock but I Don't know.

I'm a barista looking to expand my knowledge into the coffee roasting area. Would much appreciate if you could recommend me any coffee farms where they provide trainings and courses. Coffee schools are ok as well!!
