First time mom here knowing that people will want to stop by to see baby + some will probably stay with us for extended periods of time (have 2 sets of in-laws), my mom plans to come over to help me, etc. I know this is a delicate season for me and my husband will be around to help out, but what are things we should have on hand to make guests‚Äô stay/time with us (and therefore mine) easier? Wanting to prep before it happens so I have things other mommas wish they had!

(All of mine & my husband‚Äôs family is super awesome, but I‚Äôm the type that wants to have the easy stuff purchased, put away, & taken care of so we can fully enjoy the time when it comes)

Types of ideas I‚Äôm thinking of:

- Paper goods (plates, paper towels, plastic cups, etc): We are crunchy and normally only use glass, so this is different for me

-  Plenty of coffee, tea, & coffee cups

I‚Äôve read that the optimal offgassing for dark roast is anywhere from 5 to 10 days and medium roasts are anywhere from 10 to 14 days. I just received a shipment of three bags of beans from a small roaster in AZ (Chubute) that a friend recommended. I ordered a bag of medium roast espresso, dark roast, and medium roast decaf that were all roasted on the 6th. Of course I have no patience so I open the decaf and brewed a decaf espresso, which I tasted, and then turned into an Americano. I was surprised to find that it pulled with a normal amount of crema. It‚Äôs listed as a medium roast on the bag, but it‚Äôs definitely a dark roast, which really doesn‚Äôt matter to me because it tasted terrific. Maybe it‚Äôs a fluke because it‚Äôs decaf, but I‚Äôm going open and try the regular beans in the morning. What‚Äôs been your experience in offgassing and when do you find it‚Äôs an optimal time to dig into a new bag of dark or medium roast?

I pressed buttons.

White meant ready.

Red: Finished.

Yellow: Eject.

When the machine was ready, I pressed:

Forward.

Forward.

Left.

Forward.

I waited three minutes, then I hit eject.

It paid well for what I did, which was sit and press buttons. I got the job straight out of high school. 

I did initially want to be a mascot, but apparently, I don't have what it takes. 

However, I was offered a job in maintenance making mascots. 

I had a screen showing me a bird's-eye view of the machines down below, but I didn't actually see the process. 

I figured it was boring, anyway. We were just making costumes. 

The screen displaying the footage was locked. 

Unless there was an emergency, I didn't see anything. 

The music drove me mad.

It was *loud*, especially during processing.

It was always that same tune, *When you wish upon a star*, on repeat. Which was so loud, I started taking my own headphones and laughing to my own music. 

Two weeks ago, I had a headache, so after pressing the usual buttons (forward, forward, forward, left, forward), I reached for my coffee, taking a scorching sip‚Äî

Spilling it all over myself, and the control panel.

Pulling out my earbuds, I grabbed a napkin; my gaze glued to the panel which was toast. Right in the middle of processing product#127890. 

I was about to stab the emergency button under my desk when the music‚Ä¶ stopped. That constant tune (dah-dah-dah-dah-dahhhh) slamming into my brain came to an abrupt halt, and something else cut through the uneasy silence. I never questioned the music. 

I secretly believed in the conspiracy that the song was played over and over again, to subtly drive workers to work harder. 

But now the music had stopped, something felt wrong. 

Initially, I thought it was a machine acting up‚Äîbut no. 

Something ice-cold wriggled down my spine. 

*Screams.* 

I could hear agonizing screams. And  because the panel was toast, the mechanics were messing up. 

When the locked screen flashed up, I found myself staring inside Unit 56. 

All I could see was red dripping from the walls, the ceiling, spinning blades slowly descending from every angle, needles and saws inches from a guy. 

Early twenties. I could see where the work had begun on his face, peeling a chunk of flesh from his cheekbones. 

He stood with his arms by his sides, swaying, half lidded eyes glued to oblivion.  But after I stabbed a button with an eye symbol, he jerked suddenly, blinking rapidly, like he was waking up. 

He was awake and aware, *inches* from a frozen saw. 

The boy's lips parted, a guttural cry rattling my skull. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù  He broke into a sob. ‚ÄúWhat's going on?‚Äù he whispered, straining against metal arms restraining him. 

His cries fell into incomprehensible screams, guttural cries I wanted to block out. Slowly, when my brain was fully registering what I was staring at, my clammy hands slipped from my ears.

Somehow, I thought it was my fault; that I hadn't done my job properly, and a worker had gotten caught inside the machines. 

But the steel restraints wrapped around him were molded for a *human*. 

I found my voice, despite my brain screaming. When you wish upon a wasn't played to help me work. It was played to cover the screams. 

‚ÄúCalm down, okay?‚Äù I crawled over to the panel, stabbing at buttons. 

I was aware I‚Äôd puked, thick, acidic sludge running down my chin. ‚ÄúWhat's your name?‚Äù

The boy broke down, and I noticed, my gut twisting, I could see his skull. 

‚ÄúSam.‚Äù he whispered. He was wearing a an engagement ring. I saw it glittering on his index finger. ‚ÄúI want to go‚Ä¶ home.‚Äù

I couldn't respond, my hands trembling, tearing at my hair. 

I could barely feel my own fingernails ripping hair from my scalp. 

‚ÄúWhy can't I feel anything?‚Äù Sam sobbed. 

I tried every button, but the panel was locked. 

I couldn't lift the metal bars restraining his torso. 

I couldn't save him. 

I was ready to go down there, and free him manually, when my talkie came to life. ‚ÄúEleanor?‚Äù My manager's voice crackled through my talkie. 

‚ÄúIf there's a problem, press the overload button, and soon, please. The entrails need to be disposed of. The cleaner needs to be dispatched.‚Äù

I couldn't move.

Couldn't breathe.

‚ÄúGet him out of there.‚Äù I managed to whisper. 

It's like she was completely ignoring me. Like she was used to people disobeying her. ‚ÄúEleanor?‚Äù My manager repeated. ‚ÄúAll right, I'll continue processing from my end.‚Äù

No.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease report to my office after your shift. There will be disciplinary actions against you.‚Äù

I dived forward, and a guard entered, immediately restraining me, forcing my arms behind my back. 

I screamed, hysterical, but they wouldn't let me go. The control panel lit up bright red, and Sam started screaming again. 

I heard him spluttering out my name. But his cries didn't last long. 

‚ÄúSam.‚Äù I lunged forward, but the guard violently yanked me back, muffling my screams. 

I just stood there, FORCED to stand there, watching the machine continue, mercilessly slicing through Sam, splitting his bones apart, and stuffing his remnants, including his brain, into a shiny new Flynn Ryder costume. The flaps of skin resembling lips spread into a joyful grin. 

‚ÄúJ-just can't-get my n-n-nose right!‚Äù

‚ÄúEject the product, Eleanor.‚Äù

I managed to shake my head, paralyzed to the spot. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Her sigh crackled through the speaker. ‚ÄúEject the product, or you are *fired*.‚Äù

When I refused again, she did it herself, and then fired me on the spot. 

On the screen, a brand new Flynn Ryder mascot walked out.

And a red haired girl, caught up in a trance, slowly walked in. 

Ariel. 

The screen flashed white, and I had no fucking control over it. 

*Ready*. 

Forward.

Forward.

Left.

Face the spinning blades.

*Forward.*

Before I could stop myself, I lunged forward and stabbed STOP. 

I heard the sound of blades coming to a halt, and that was enough. 

But I couldn't do anything past that. I was dragged out of there. 

After a sit down with my boss, she made it very clear that if I said anything, my family would be in danger. 

I went home and tried to end it. I stood in front of my bathroom mirror and I couldn't stand kneeling the truth about those things. I keep seeing Sam. 

I keep wondering who he was‚Äìif he had a family, a significant other, or siblings. 

In my head, I go back to that slaughterhouse. I'm back in my office, during the processing. 

And this time I managed to stop it. I take Sam home. 

Instead, I just stood there, fucking hopeless. I  couldn't save them‚Äì and to Sam‚Äôs family, I am so fucking sorry I let you down. 

Look, I've spoken to my therapist, and she suggested writing things down. 

So, I am. I'm writing everything I can remember. 

But I'm BEGGING you. When you get the chance, please just take a second look at the Disney mascots. 

There's a human inside. Even if they're twisted beyond recognition. 

And I'm sure, somewhere deep down, whatever left of them is screaming to be let out.

Just don't ask for its real name. Walk away and don't look back.

Or, like me, you will go insane.",3,1739246536.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

About a month later my body got used to it and the feeling of being hungry has now gone and my brain has really started to enjoy the feeling of having an empty stomach. I think the rapid weight loss has also helped with my motivation too. I wondered if I could stick to this but 9 months later I think I've squashed all my doubts. 

If you've ever wondered whether you could successfully fast, from someone who thought it would be impossible let me just say it's totally within reach!

My biggest tip (other than the coffee) is if you're an addict like me, be honest to yourself about it. If you're able to control yourself then great. But if 1 cheeseburger is the gateway to 10 cheeseburgers, then stop lying to yourself that you can handle 1 and cut it all out, cold turkey. Treat it like any other addiction - drugs, smokes, etc. If you can't control yourself with 1 smoke then you have to cut out all smokes. This self-delusion that you can casually smoke one a day is nonsense and you know it. The same applies to food. Lying to to yourself only hurts you, no one else is affected. This was the biggest breakthrough I made, mentally. I had to accept I couldn't control myself before I could really commit to fasting. ",6,1739246195.0,loseit,0,0.8,False

""So,"" Mary said, taking a long drag ""this is it then?""

""Yes ma'am."" the man said calmly, his hands placed atop his crossed knees. 

""Please..."" she sucked in a sharp breath, a quiet sob escaping her lips. She pleaded with the man, hoping she could invoke some compassion within him.

""What's it like?"" She whispered, taking his hand. The man laughed, guttural and deep.

""It's hell, Mary. What do you think it's like?""

<><><><><><>

I stepped out of my patrol vehicle with a grunt, being met by one of my officers on scene. 

""What we got?""

""Human remains. We found a hand, looks to be a woman's hand by the size and wedding ring. The neighbors found it and called, a man named Jacob Webb.""

With a nod, I walked into the house and was met with a pristine living room save for a slightly scorched armchair, a pile of ash, and a human hand. 

I stared, brow furrowed, confused as to how nothing else was burned. The faint smell of burnt hair and sulfur lingered in the air. 

""What's the ash from?"" I asked as I smeared some between my fingers, noticing the strange grit within them. 

""Don't know. There's no ashes anywhere else. None in the fireplace either. Just some cigarette ash in the ash tray. ""

""Hmm. Where's the neighbor that found it?""

I was directed to the front lawn where Mr. Webb stood, a haggard man looking to be about 70, arms crossed over his chest. 

""Mr. Webb? I'm Sheriff Thompson. I've heard you're the one who called? Can you walk me through what you found?""

""Yes sir. Well me 'n my wife was having supper and we heard Mary yellin'. I look out my front winda and don't see nothin' amiss so we go back to eatin'. Couple minutes go by 'n we hear Mary just a screamin'. I run over here and knock on her door but she don't answer. So I open her door 'n call her name but don't get no answer neither. I walk in a little ways 'n see a hand on that chair so run back to my house 'n call the law. Now we standin' here talkin.""

""Did Mary have any visitors tonight that you saw?""

"" No, Mary don't keep no comp'ny. She keep to herself most days, we see her gettin' the mail on Tuesdys but not much else. She lived in that house with her mama and daddy. When they passed on, she stayed there. Me 'n my wife bought this house right before Mary had her boy, we known her a long time.  ""

""Is she married? Any other kids?""

""She had a husband but he died shortly after their only boy was born. Had a work accident of some kind. Two years after her husband died, her boy got sick. Doctors didn't know what was wrong, just that he wasn't gonna survive it. Some kinda cancer they reckon but don't rightly know. Mary did a lotta prayin' back then and I s'pose the good lord answered her prayers because her boy lived. One day he's dyin', the next day he's...not. He was up walkin' around again like he weren't ever sick.""

I scribbled notes into my notebook, listening as the old man recounted the story. ""Where's her son now?""

""He moved up north 'bout 25 years ago. Got married, had his own kids. He ain't been back here since far as I know 'cept for Christmas time every couple years. Got him a good job, some kinda law office or other. ""

I finished my notes and closed my book, tucking it into my breast pocket. ""Thank you sir, you can go on home now. We'll come see you if we need you again. ""

Mr. Webb nodded, walking slowly back to his house. I went back into Mary's, continuing my observation of the scene.

<><><><><><>

I walked into the coroner's office, handing him a cup of coffee. 

""Thank ya, Sheriff."" He took a long drink from his cup as he sat down, blowing out a short quick breath. ""So these pictures here, the armchair and the floor in front of the couch. These were the only areas burned?"" 

""Yes, Josiah. Nothing else was touched anywhere and we went through that damn house twice.""

Josiah scratched his beard stubble as he handed me the pictures. 

""Well, the ashes found with the hand are human remains. We contacted Mary's son so that we can get him here to test his dna against the hand and the bigger bone fragments in the ashes.""

I looked down at my hands, rubbing them together. I could still feel the ash on my fingertips.

""They look to have been cremated but there's no sign of foul play or a break in. And any fire hot enough to burn a body to ash would've sent that whole house up in flames, not scorched part of the chair and the floor. And it damn sure wouldn't have left a hand behind cauterized at the wrist. Even if her cigarette had an ember fly off, it wouldn't have burned her body up like that.""

I stood quickly, pushing my chair back in frustration. 

""It doesn't make any goddamn sense, Josiah! We've been going over this case for weeks, we've been talking to every medical examiner, firefighter, police force and goddamned self proclaimed arsonist around and not a goddamned bit if it makes sense!""

Josiah sat back, placing his interlaced fingers behind his head. 

""Sheriff, I've been talking to some colleagues of mine about this to get their opinion because I was stumped too. After some some long talks and a few too many whiskey sours, I might have something. But sheriff, you have to trust me.""

""You know I trust you, Josiah, I need SOMETHING in this case.""

Josiah sat forward, staring through me as he pulled a stack of disheveled papers from his desk drawer and tossed them onto my side of the desk. 

""Let me ask you something. Have you ever heard of spontaneous human combustion?""",3,1739245828.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a college grad working two jobs and making decent money. My boyfriend is an aspiring professional skateboarder who works a full-time retail job but doesn‚Äôt make much money, and he‚Äôs also in a lot of debt. He has a pretty impressive skateboarding career but he hasn‚Äôt made it yet to really be making money from it, he is still pursuing it but has strong accomplishments.

I love him for who he is, and while his financial situation doesn‚Äôt define him as a person, it‚Äôs been really hard for me to carry the financial load in our relationship. At first, we were splitting the costs of going out to eat for the most part, but after a couple months of us talking, I‚Äôve ended up paying for everything ‚Äî rent, utilities, groceries, eating out, everything. He doesn‚Äôt really contribute at all now that I think of it and I know it's because he‚Äôs struggling financially. Still, it‚Äôs starting to feel like I‚Äôm being taken for granted. He buys little treats for me here and there (like coffees or pastries x1 per month), but those gestures feel more like small tokens, and they don‚Äôt balance out the larger financial burden I‚Äôm carrying.

We moved into a new apartment together, and I‚Äôve paid for all the furniture and household items. I‚Äôm constantly cooking, cleaning, and handling the housework too. I handle all the burden of living for 2 people, he just gets to relax and have a maid and free things to use and eat.  I‚Äôve asked him to help with basic chores (like taking out the trash), but I‚Äôm often the one reminding him to do so. He doesn‚Äôt contribute financially or help around the house unless I directly ask him to.

For example, he‚Äôs never taken me out to a sit-down dinner and paid for it. He‚Äôll sometimes pay for his own food when we go out, but it‚Äôs extremely rare for him to treat me. I try to empathize with him since I know he‚Äôs pursuing his dreams, but it‚Äôs starting to feel like his goals and passions come first, and I‚Äôm just his financial safety net. He spends any leftover money he has on skateboarding gear or events, while I‚Äôm stuck paying for everything else. I‚Äôve tried talking to him about how this makes me feel, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to lead to any real changes. When I offer to pay him back for things, I always do, but he doesn‚Äôt reciprocate the same energy. Maybe the way I am phrasing things to him is too kind as I try to be sensitive to all the debt and bills he has. 

What frustrates me most is that he never seems to offer to pay me back, contribute to household expenses, or even make me feel special financially. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm constantly doing favors for him, helping him with his hobby or making his life easier, and it‚Äôs starting to feel like I‚Äôm his mom more than his partner.

I know I‚Äôm probably coming off a little frustrated, and I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm blaming him or saying he‚Äôs using me ‚Äî I do believe he loves me, and I love him. But I also feel like I‚Äôm being disrespected. I‚Äôve had a couple conversations with him, and while he acknowledges it, it doesn‚Äôt lead to any meaningful change. He has heard me complain about how high my credit card bill is and how often we go out to eat but he doesn‚Äôt really have a solution. He‚Äôs never gone to the grocery store alone for us. He has gone with me about 5 times, other than that I always go alone. Overall, this is harboring a lot of resentment for me. I cherish this man very much and he is a wonderful partner in every aspect except this one. 

So, Reddit, what do you think? How can I talk to him about this without making him feel like I‚Äôm accusing him of using me? I want to be honest about my needs without making things awkward. I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm sacrificing my hard-earned money while he‚Äôs not pulling his weight ‚Äî but I also want to find a way to work through this. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

Thanks for any advice you can offer.

### Training
I recently got a bug to start running some shorter distance races after dropping a dissapointing yet not totally awful (first time) 3:38 at Chicago this past October. I am covinced that some strong performances in shorter events will help drive me to sub 3:20 in addition to just racking up miles.To provide further context, I have been running anywhere from 30-45mpw since Chicago for funsies.

I derived most of my workouts from a combination of Pfitz marathon plans and split the phases of training into two week incriments. My 'build' was weeks 1-2: week 1 had 33 miles, and week 2 ramped up to mid 40s. I peaked with weeks 3-4 both cresting 50mpw,and then tapered during weeks 5-6 with 32,33 mpw, respectively, with the final week milage including the 10K. 

A majority of my workouts were easy 7-10 mile runs (7:45-8:30/mi) with a speed workout, long run, and a 4-5 mile recovery run mixed in throughout the week. To Monday Morning Quarterback myself a little bit (pun intended), I probably should have done a Vo2 workout (6:02-6:25/mi) in addition to a tempo workout (6:51-7:38/mi) or threshold workout (6:25-6:51/mi) during the week instead of doing just one, but am curious what the quality of my workouts would have been, especially on the high mileage weeks of a short training block. I guess another adujstment could have been lower mileage overall but higher difficulty of workouts...

Early on in the race week, I ran a 7mi dress rehersal with 2 @10K and managed to wreck my heel on a pair of Hyperion Max 2's that should have been retired. Theragunned the shit out of my right leg as the pain had permiated up to my hamstring in the form of cramps but felt really strong coming into race day. 

### Pre-Race
Wasn't able to have my traditional bagle with PB or Double shot of espresso because i had run out of coffee pods and pulled out a moldy sleeve of bagels from my cabinet. Oh well, settled for a regular cup of coffee and a cliff bar. Drove down, did a 1-mile warm up with some striders to the start line, found my co-workers and chatted with them until the anthem. 

### Race
I am a humble guy, when the announcer says, ""Fast runners to the front"", I try not to dash up to the start. However I do forget that 'fast-runner' is a very vague term so I paid for my humility by ducking and weaving for the first 400m. I figured that cost me a bit of energy but still cruised to my goal pace for the first mile. Unfortunately the course was not flat so it was definitely a challenge but made sure to take advantage of my leg length to catch my breath on the downhills. Everything went to plan except for a lady at the *second to last hill* saying, ""Good Job! Last hill!"" Well that lady was a bonafide liar because not 1/4 mile later I was running up a 270 degree hairpin turn into the final stretch with all of my oxygen dumped out on the 2nd to last hill. Ended up finding the last bit of energy to 'sprint' in for a decently respectable 41:20 finish. A minute short of my 'A' goal time but honestly had a blast. Any input on how everyone else designs their workouts leading up to a 10k would be much appreciated but I think I just need to get the Pfitz short distance book at this point. Also, I have not written this much since I graduated college so please forgive any grammatical, spelling, or stylistic errors in my writting. 

Cheers!

Each time we've seen one she likes they've been in the hundreds and unfortunately that's out of our price range at the moment... Now here's where I messed up ... We walked into a goodwill and there it was probably the ugliest rocking chair I have ever seen in my entire life, the most impractical rocking chair I have ever seen and unfortunately I have zero tact (and my two braincells were struggling to kill each other)... So she whips around and says what do u think of that chair? I told her the truth and I watched her dream shatter before me, she didn't say anything she didn't bring the chair back up again but I saw it in her eyes.

... she just cared that she found a rocking chair in our price range at last and that she felt shot down in that moment but didn't want to admit it and bring the mood down.

The idea that our current system was designed to¬†devalue¬†the money we work so hard for shook me to my core. I took action‚ÄîI started¬†buying gold and silver, determined to build something real for myself outside of the broken system. I even tried¬†bartering at the farmers market with junk silver, but it quickly became clear that most people just weren‚Äôt used to the idea.

My friend (17F) is pretty broke. We can call her Patty. She's usually really nice, but she asks for a lot of financial support. We meet up at a nearby coffee shop everyday before school and she asks for me to purchase her something over half the time. I usually say no, and her response is usually negative (She'll often pay for it herself if we don't and then complain we don't pay for her, but I don't know if she needs that money that she's spending for food or whatever). She'll ask anyone who's around, even those she's not close to. I often have a lot of leftover money and spend it freely (clothes, little luxuries, electronics, etc, but nothing necessary)

I feel a bit bad about it since I make a lot more than she does (nothing) but I also feel like I shouldn't have to financially support her.

1impe95,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1impe95/38m_i_am_really_not_sure_what_to_do/,(38M) I am really not sure what to do.,"So in the past several months, I have really set out to clean myself up. Taking deeper care of myself: Working out, trying to grow my hair back, and generally working really hard on myself.

The big problem is inside, I feel unlovable and unwanted, and that emotional wounding is wrestling with a monstrous desire for deep, meaningful human relation. I want all of it: I want the attraction, the deep conversations, the disagreements, the fights, the sex, ALL of it.

I am also extremely affection starved. My parents isolated and abused me to the point where even after I left them, I still felt alone despite having roommates, and even stayed alone because I still, to this day, feel unwanted. Now, being over 70 days clean of my addiction, I realize how badly I want a woman to just snuggle me and almost suffocate me with affection and physical contact.

I want to actually LOVE a woman, and not just dump my problems on her. I don't want to seem desperate, or be an emotional leech. It's a conundrum I cannot seem to resolve.

There are a couple of women I intend to ask out for coffee soon (one at a time, obviously) just to see what happens, and I REALLY don't want this to get in the way of my confidence. I become very reserved and soft-spoken around cute girls already. I don't need to be paralyzed by this.

1impad4,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1impad4/i_dont_even_know_whats_sincere_anymore/,I don't even know what's sincere anymore,"Hi everyone I just joined here and wanted to share what I've been through somewhere and kind of see some other opinions about this. For the context, my parents divorced when I was 5, court gave my custody to my dad and I was raised by my dad's parents. Mom got married again afterwards. So my dad never allowed me to stay at my mom's overnight even though her husband was working outside the country. At that time I didn't get the reason why. Then some problems arose around the time I was about to start university and I kinda just found myself at my mom's.

This is where the things gets interesting. My half sister kind of worships mom. When they did argue even though sis is right she is always the one who goes for the apology and says she's sorry for making mom sad. I've lived with them for 8 months. I'm not very sociable in the home. I prefer to stay in my room reading books or gaming. Also I'm not the touchy type. 

Every single time something happened and I argued with mom, she said that I don't even love her and I don't even hug her sincerely. She told me;

""You see this house as a hotel, don't you? You never leave your room you never sit with us in the living room. You only leave your room for meal times. You are only here for using me as a leverage to go to another city for university.""

Every time I tried to explain her that this is just how I am and it doesn't mean I love you, she threw something back at me like how I don't love her really or how I'm not sincere about it. How we were just *reunited* after 13 years apart but I seem to not care...

So the main thing is, after all the arguments (there were some big ones where she tried to decide my future instead of me) I decided to turn back to my dad's side. In the last conversation I've had with her she told me this exact sentence.

""My stupid daughter. If you were wanting to live with your dad this much why did you torture us for 8 months?"" (It's a little bit off since our native language is not English)

When I heard her say this I've felt like the world will come crumble down at that exact moment. While I was leaving her house she gave me pocket money. But all the time I've been living there she didn't give anything to me while saying that is how her husband's money and how she can't spend that on me.

I wish everything just stayed like that. I don't even know if this is appropriate to write here. If not I'm really sorry for the trouble.

We kept contact time to time. We spend good time together but it never felt like it was mother and daughter. One time I went to her house after I argued with my dad. She tried to badmouth him and I just didn't want that to happen so I told her that she's not all pure as well and that I didn't forget that she said how I tortured them 8 months. She just nonchalantly answered me by saying ""Well wasn't it?"" I guess that was my breaking point. Also some things happened with my sis as well. Mom kinda tried to keep me away from her.

Then I visited her one last time to speak about everything. Everything that's been weighing. I even prepared a little paper for myself because I knew I would cry and forget what I want to say. The thing is... That conversation lasted 40 minutes or something like that. 

Every time I said ""Mom I don't feel your attention or care or love for me."" She always responded with;

""Well you are the one who refused my love and care to begin with.""
""You didn't love me.""
""What should i have done? Should I have stayed with your mad father?"" (For the context the reason why they divorced is that she cheated. I recently found out about that.)

And lots off stuff like this. All those 40 minutes, I couldn't speak more than 5 or maybe 10 minutes. After that I cut all the contact with her. Only text message I've got from her was ""Didn't you miss me?"" After seeing it I blocked her completely.

It's been a little more than a year. I'm still questioning if she really was sincere all those times we spend time together. We never did too much but even just sitting together, hitting a conversation while drinking coffee. Those were some precious memories of mine. But I find myself questioning if those were really sincere or not? One side of me wants to speak with her but other side thinks it'll hurt me more... I kinda don't want to speak with her but I can't stop my thoughts about these.

Back again for another attempt. Everyone has been so much help, I appreciate it all. Hopefully I am getting closer to having it ready. Thanks in advance for taking a look at it!

  


Dear \[Agent\],

I‚Äôm seeking representation for my contemporary romance, *THE SUNSETS WITH YOU*, an 89,000-word novel perfect for fans of When in Rome by Sarah Adams and Meet Me at the Lake by Carley Fortune. With its small-town charm, sizzling tension, emotional depth, ambition, and the courage it takes to let someone in. Standalone with series potential.¬†

The last thing Lena Oakley expects is for Hollywood‚Äôs golden boy, Callum Hayes, to show up in her sleepy Maine town‚Äîespecially not after having his heart stomped on by his ex and the tabloids. For Lena, Greenwater is both a safe haven and a suffocating trap: a place where the coffee shop knows her order and the lake calms her thoughts, but also where she feels stuck in a dead-end job with no real future. She‚Äôs always dreamed of making a name for herself behind the scenes of Broadway, but staying in control has always meant keeping people at arm‚Äôs length.

That is, until Callum.

A chance encounter at her favorite bar turns into an unexpected partnership when she‚Äôs assigned to work on his new company‚Äôs ad campaign. Lena has a rule‚Äîone chance, and if someone hurts her, they‚Äôre out. But Callum isn‚Äôt like anyone else. He‚Äôs persistent and patient, showing up every morning with her favorite coffee and apologies that feel too genuine to ignore. He‚Äôs charming, slowly breaking through her carefully built walls. And, worst of all, he believes in her in a way she‚Äôs never experienced before.

While Lena decides to take a leap and leave for New York, with Callum supporting her but staying in Maine for his new start, she feels him slowly slipping through her fingers. As they work through what real love takes, she flourishes in the city with support of her friends. She hopes they both grow together, figuring out their new life together. Lena has to confront tough questions about trust, love, and growth; finding a way to reevaluate her dreams.

I‚Äôm a debut author living in West Michigan, originally from a small town near the Great Lakes. *THE SUNSETS WITH YOU* was inspired by my own experiences growing up on the water, and I hope it captures the magic of finding both home and love in unexpected places. Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

I've been gaming (well, mostly just dota1-2) for almost 15 years now. I'm really passionate about e-sports but never really got the courage to pursue a career in it. A few years back, I tried shoutcasting in dota2 but never really stuck to it because of financial needs. Now I think I'm ready to do whatever it takes to finally do what makes me smile. As they say, if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life. I want that kinda vibe in the future.

  
I'm thinking of something like a social media broadcasting network that will cover as much competitive games as possible. A broadcasting network solely focused on promoting and helping cultivate e-sports in the Philippines. We'll start small, of course. We'll take it one game at a time. If you look at PH esports channels currently available, there's a gap we can very well fit in. Collaborating with and centralizing all the platforms available for a one-stop shop experience for the filipino gaming community.

  
1. Broadcast, news, shoutcasting;  
2. sponsoring, hosting and managing small tournaments to cultivate young talents allowing pinoy pro-teams of whatever competitive game to discover new talented players;  
3. scholarly articles - there's just close to nothing on this in the Philippines.

  
If you're a misfit unhappy with your current career and has the time to spare to help me kick this off the ground, please reach out. I welcome people of different skills and talents from across different industries. If you think you're up to untangling and pursuing this stupid idea in my head, let me know.

I'm not going to lie-it was a little stressful. We were a person down, and as someone who needs a bit more time to learn things, it was challenging to keep track of everything and remember what needed to be done at specific times.
One of my tasks was getting the pull put away within 45 minutes, but since my coworkers were getting a little slammed and needed my help, I stepped in‚Äî which unfortunately made me go over that time limit.
I'm also still getting the hang of reading the schedule and working with Play Builder. I understand it, but I know I should be doing it faster.
Even though I was aware of when peak hours were, things seemed to get even busier afterward, which threw me off a little. Also i didn't realize a barista was 30 min over, i felt really bad.
At least, i got lot done-I managed the pull, money handling, Play Builder, all my tens, floors, mid-bar, orders, ovens, and mid-day tasks. However, I can't shake the feeling that I should be performing better, especially after six years as a partner. The other shift ended up helping me with the order and the high variance order since I wasn't sure how to do it, which made me feel like I should have been more prepared.
Overall, I feel like the turnover wasn't as smooth as it could have been, even though my shift reassured me that it was fine. I just can't help but feel like I sho be doing better.",5,1739243848.0,starbucks,2,1.0,False

# 

The room smelled of stale coffee and cleaning solution. It was the kind of scent that stuck to the air‚Ä¶ neither offensive nor comforting‚Ä¶ just there. The walls were an uninspired shade of beige, the kind of color someone had picked decades ago and no one had bothered to update. The overhead fluorescent lights flickered just enough to be noticeable, humming softly like an insect trapped inside the casing.



The chairs, stiff-backed and arranged in a neat row against the wall, were covered in synthetic leather that creaked under the weight of anyone who dared sit too long. The carpet, a dull brown, had a visible trail worn down the middle where countless feet had shuffled back and forth. A framed poster on the wall read **‚ÄúHealing Begins with You‚Äù** in generic blue cursive over an image of a perfectly symmetrical pebble balanced on water. Another poster beside it, curling slightly at the edges, displayed a serene landscape with the words **""Trust the Process.""** Neither of them paid it any mind.



Rory sat with her arms crossed, her fingers tapping against her sleeve. She glanced at the clock. It was the kind of clock that ticked loudly but never seemed to move. Arthur sat beside her, tapping his foot in a nervous, offbeat rhythm. If either of them had noticed the other‚Äôs irritation, neither said a word.



The air in the room was thick with unspoken words. The quiet between them had transformed from a temporary ceasefire into an unrelenting presence‚Ä¶ a third entity in their failing marriage.



Rory glanced at Arthur, catching the way his jaw clenched‚Ä¶ the way his fingers twitched as if he wanted to reach for something but had forgotten what. She knew the signs. He was deep in thought, probably rehearsing something he would never say aloud.



They had tried everything. Therapists‚Ä¶ self-help books‚Ä¶ couples‚Äô retreats. Each effort had ended in the same result‚Ä¶ exhaustion. The fights had become cyclical‚Ä¶ predictable‚Ä¶ a back-and-forth of blame and counter-blame that never quite resolved anything.



This appointment‚Ä¶ this strange, last-ditch hypnotherapy session‚Ä¶ was their final attempt before admitting the inevitable.



Rory‚Äôs jaw was tight. She wanted to believe this was worth it‚Ä¶ but she had run out of hope months ago. She had spent so much time trying to reach Arthur‚Ä¶ to make him understand‚Ä¶ but it felt like screaming into a void. No matter how loud she got‚Ä¶ no matter how clear she thought she was being‚Ä¶ he never heard her.



Maybe he just didn‚Äôt care enough to listen.



Maybe they were too far gone‚Ä¶ orbiting each other like dying stars‚Ä¶ close enough to feel the pull but too distant to collide.



Arthur wasn‚Äôt sure why they were even here. He had stopped believing in fixes. The love was still there‚Ä¶ somewhere‚Ä¶ buried beneath the resentment and exhaustion‚Ä¶ but it had become impossible to find.



Everything he did seemed to be the wrong thing‚Ä¶ and he had given up trying to get it right. He stared at the floor, counting the stains in the carpet, waiting for whatever this was to be over. A memory surfaced‚Ä¶ late nights talking in bed‚Ä¶ her laughter filling the dark‚Ä¶ a time when things were easy.



That version of them felt like strangers now.



The receptionist, a young woman with a crisp blouse and an overly practiced smile, looked up from her computer.



**‚ÄúArthur?‚Äù** she called, her voice bright‚Ä¶ indifferent.



For the first time since entering the office, Rory and Arthur made eye contact. A brief‚Ä¶ searching look.



For a moment, something stirred‚Ä¶ a flicker of what had once been‚Ä¶



But it was gone just as quickly.



# This is the moment where everything changes.



Who are you?



Do you stand when your name is called? Do you follow the receptionist into the unknown‚Ä¶ leaving Rory behind in that stiff, uncomfortable chair?



Or do you remain seated‚Ä¶ watching as Arthur disappears through the door‚Ä¶ wondering if anything will ever bring him back?

  


If you choose to be **Arthur, turn to page 12.**

If you choose to be **Rory, turn to page 17.**

1imozde,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imozde,Just returned- wonderful trip!,"Hey everyone üòä
I just got back from 8 wonderful days in colombia (5 in cartagena and 3 in Baru at the beach). I went with my husband and 3 other couples (mid 30s). This sub is a really weird mix of experiences so just wanted to write how positive the trip was for us.  

Food- cartagena is a really fun foodie city! Many restaurants focus on the total experience,  vibe and service which is very cool. We tried a lot of the classic food recommendations we were given-  pescado frito, aroz con coco, suero, arepas, cerviche, cheese and so many fruits!  And of course tried from the street vendors. 

We dined at
Dona Lola- Food was good. Ambiance and decor are excellent. They had violin players come around the restaurant. Cocktails were excellent- perhaps our favorite of the trip!

Cande- Food and cocktails here are good not great. I think I got the best meal (pescado frito). Go for the experience built around a tree , open air,  and fun live performers.  

Celele- Very elevated gourmet dining, all sourced in colombia . Excellent service with the dishes being explained very well.  The food is presented beautifully- like food art! 

Morena- Vibes in this restaurant are very cool,  everything instagramable. Food and drinks are once again good but not great.

El burlador- my absolute favorite! It's a Mediterranean and colombian fusion restaurant.  Drinks, wine,  service and vibe all excellent . Every dish was amazing! 

Epoca-Go for coffee- very very good! The honey latte is delicious.  

El libertario- also very good coffee. Avocado toast- yummy!

Movich- view from the Rooftop great for sunset.  Skip the food, go for drinks and move on.  

Alquimico- sorry to say we did not find it worth the hype! 

Stay- We stayed at an airbnb in getsemani and then an airbnb in baru. Our final two nights we stayed at Ermita which is just outside the walled city (easy walk or uber) . We stayed in Barugrande at the beach- which was relaxing and quiet' just what we wanted. 

Tours- 

we did a coffee tasting experience which was very fun and educational in terms of the colombia coffee regions and preparation. 

We did a private birding tour via get your guide to the Matute preserve.  This was such a wonderful experience that I highly recommend for nature lovers or birders. 

In Baru we booked a private boat to go to rosario islands and snorkel.  I highly recommend booking a private boat. We avoided Cholon bc that is not our scene- it was very nice to do it this way. 


My friends did the streetfood like a local tour (while we were in the dry forest at Matute hiking) , and they loved it! 

Safety- We felt safe the entire time. With that being said we were a large group,  stayed in tourist areas and used common sense (no flashy Jewelery/ watch,  stay in well lit areas,  did not travel alone). 

This sub made me so afraid of the vendors,  they really were not that bad IMO. Most were very nice and left you alone after a no gracias or smile and continue walking.  Honestly, I felt like I was more on edge in times Square,  Athens and Paris in monmarte! 

Colombia was really wonderful. People are friendly and kind.  Food (especially the fruit) is so wonderful and fresh. The colors and the sun! Highly recommend and overall wonderful vacation.  I already want to go back and explore another region/ city! ",16,1739243678.0,cartagena,7,1.0,False

Interview Date: Feb 6, Thursday.  
Location: Seattle WA

  
All interviewers were located in Seattle and I am on the east coast.

Round 1: 2 LC questions with SDE2. This round I needed a lot of clarification for the first question because it was top k elements from a data stream and the interviewer wanted me to make the data stream class and then implement the method. I needed a lot of clarification for the question to get that I needed to make the class but I implemented it with all follow ups correct. Space and time was correct. Second question was sliding window two sum and I got that correct with no clarifications. Time and space was good too.

Round 2: Bar raiser L9. Fully behavioral and I thought it went well considering the interviewer had gotten my hopes up saying ""I hope the outcome of this interview is what you want."" He also said that he really liked my answer for the last question and ... Generally thought I did well.

Round 3: LLD question with L7 manager. Interviewer first gave me the pizza design and 5 mins into it he asked if I did it already and I said yes. Then he said that he would give me starbucks lld (basically pizza but with coffee). I literally finished it in 15 mins and talked to him the whole time. For the rest of the time he said we were gonna do a SDE2 question and had me do system design for a notification system. I had also gotten this correct except I did not account for a bottle neck for one endpoint. I had proposed a solution and he was happy. He also said ""I am very satisfied with this interview, and it was a pleasure to see you be able to do both exercises.""

  
It is currently Feb 10, 2 business days later and at 9:14pm EST, so 6:14pm in Seattle, I got an automated rejection. I'm just really upset that they sent an automated message instead of having the recruiter email me. I also am upset about the interviewers getting my hopes up. 

  
I have asked my recruiter for any feedback and I pray that maybe I still get an offer or that it was a mistake, but the reality is that I probably was not good enough for SOME reason and sending automated emails after 3 hours of interviews and another 2 for the OA is normal.",5,1739243321.0,leetcode,3,1.0,False

More than likely I haven‚Äôt completely ‚Äúcured‚Äù my GERD nor is it even curable as far as I know but I haven‚Äôt been taking any medication for about 4 months now. 

Everything originally started when I got food poisoning in Cancun and the violent vomiting most likely started this whole thing. PPIs for about a year ranging from 40mg to 80mg at certain points. My GERD was so bad that I also had LPR and my entire esophagus was so irritated that I couldn‚Äôt eat anything remotely acidic. Even plain yogurt or milk would burn my throat on the way down. 

Anyway, here‚Äôs what helped‚Ä¶ once my training in school was done and stress levels started to go down, that was a huge help. The other big thing unsurprisingly is the food choices. No coffee, chocolate, citrusy foods, etc. you can look up the list of foods to avoid. The third thing that helped a lot was Gaviscon, even the American version as it creates a barrier at the top of your stomach preventing the acid from moving up. 

Reduce stress, watch what you eat (take a few days or a week or two to eat super plain food with 0 seasoning. I was eating plain scrambled eggs with plain grits everyday and boiled chicken and plain rice every day for a week and this made the biggest difference because it helped everything heal up) and consider taking Gaviscon before bed. There might not be any ‚Äúnew‚Äù info here, but I just want to encourage you all. I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm 100% back to normal but I‚Äôm over 90% better and still have to watch what I eat. I may never be able to drink orange juice or acidic stuff like that again. 

Original diagnosis: moderate gastritis, GERD, and inflamed esophagus seen on endoscopy. It was so bad that I was having trouble swallowing at some point.

1imosjr,https://www.reddit.com/r/tulum/comments/1imosjr/tulum_my_experience_as_a_solo_travelling_woman/,Tulum: my experience as a solo travelling woman,"It's my last day in Tulum and I would like to share some perspective as a solo travelling woman in case someone finds it useful. 

If you are a woman and you are planning a solo trip to Tulum, pls read the below. 

1) Safety

First of all, as a single, white woman, I experienced a lot of catcalling, and I didn't feel comfortable with the way Mexican men looked at me (especially Taxi drivers trying to pick me up).
I was mostly on a bike so I just ignored all that but overall felt like it was a bit invasive. 

Do not under any circumstances go out alone at night. I stayed in La Veleta which is relatively safe, there is a lot of bars and restaurants, young digital nomads (and as I later found out a lot of drug dillers and prostitutes...) But some areas are very sketchy and I was advised by a local girl to not go out alone ever. The police also apparently is dangerous towards women (she told me that she was beaten and attacked by a police officer, and also another time she was assaulted and her bag was stolen - she lives in La Veleta). 
As long as you go to your hotel after dark you are perfectly fine. I stayed in Turquoise and it was nice and safe, but I didn't go out after 8pm. 

2) Transportation

I rented a bike which was stolen unfortunately. I left it at the beach and locked (along with thousand other bikes) but it got stolen anyway in broad daylight. I was left in the beach area, 6 kilometres from town on my own. I had no choice but to take a taxi. Taxi driver charged me 600 pesos. I gave him the money when I got into the car and because I was a bit shaken up/crying because of the stolen bike, so when we arrived I forgot that I had arlready paid him and he charged me again. Yup, these guys are scammers and if you show any vulnerability, they will use that against you.
Avoid taking taxis at all cost.

The bike rental place wants me to pay 200 US$ for the stolen bike, aside from keeping the 1000 pesos deposit. I told the guy that I don't have that kind of cash and he said ""I know you have the money"" - I think that quote sums it up in Tulum üòÖ they know/assume you have the money (because you're a white tourist) and they will get it from you one way or another. 

3) Spending time/things to do

Tulum town is full of cute coffee shops and restaurants. Food is amazing and people are also really nice. 
Unfortunately, access to the beaches is a bit tricky. 
Once you get down to the beach area, there are only two public beaches - Tulum Beach and Playa Punta Piedra (the latter is where my bike got stolen).

All other beaches are only accessible to hotel/restaurant guests. Couple of times I went to the restaurant by the beach to access it. I asked if I can order a drink and hang out at the beach. Sometimes they agree, sometimes not, depends on luck. 

*Also if you pay with your credit card please be extra careful!! They like to charge in US dollars instead of MXN. 
So if you see 200$ on a bill; make sure it's pesos not dollars!!!! 


To access Playa Paraiso, and the Ruins, you need to first pay entrance fee into the national park (450 pesos), and then the only public beach is Playa Maya. You can't get directly to Playa Paraiso and other beaches down there unless you are a hotel guest. So it does not matter that you paid the entrance fee into the park...
And it's additional 100 pesos to visit the Ruins. 
You also are not allowed to bring your water and any food into that area.

Overall, yes Tulum is beautiful and it has a unique vibe. 
Do I recommend it for solo female travellers? No. I think the scam and exploitation of tourists is just not worth it and ruins the whole experience. Just because you are white you are being treated poorly as a tourist.
I understand paying more then locals - of course! But what they do in Tulum is just another level of scam.

It's clear that they just want to get as much money as they possibly can out of you and it's simply not a nice experience! 
If they see that you are just a girl travelling on her own, they will take advantage of that as well and overcharge you/give you false information so that you pay for sth/pay more. 

If you are planning to go on your own, bring a lot of extra money and be *extra* careful!!!

I **REDACTED**. I get up early on Saturday so I can knock out my chores before noon. Food, lightly salted, dressing‚Ä¶ on the side. And beer‚Ä¶.. once every few weeks. Yeah it‚Äôs like that as an aging dude. So if you are hoping to find someone who like doing his Pilates while on  mushrooms at burning man‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  you‚Äôre going to be disappointed talking to me. The most exciting thing I have done recently Is install rain catchment for my garden. Every trip I have taken in the last year was for work.

I am a single male. Never married and no kids and never want any of my own. This is reddit. We will likely never meet. Not even for a coffee even if I try to bribe you with home made pastries. I am sure my dry texting and one dimensional personality will do wonders for your insomnia. Would I like to date, yes, but let‚Äôs be realistic. Good conversation is probably the best we can ask for on reddit. I work from home and the weekly online DnD sessions aren‚Äôt really socially holding me over. 

Living on the west coast. Working one of those office jobs where I spend the day dreaming of making a living building furniture. I love music, and even play music. Maybe one day I will stop being a wuss and actually perform. NO. I don‚Äôt play DAD rock. So I will not talk your ear off about the importance of Punk Music or why some drummer is underrated. I am back in school, or more like I never really left. I am one of those people who take classes as a hobby. However I am trying to make a career change. I am a big fan of used book stores, thrift stores, galleries and museums. Yes, I have eReader but, a physical books just the business. If a cat or a dog comes up to me, I will pet it, if it let‚Äôs me. Does anyone like bird watching? Let‚Äôs find out once and for all if they ARE REAL or secret government drones. I workout and I actually enjoy it. I have my creatine and protein powder. I‚Äôm trying to learn Spanish. I am a workaholic at the moment as I am trying to make changes in my life. I see this ending soon and would like to travel and recreate more.  I haven‚Äôt had a passport in over a decade, I am severely under traveled, and I would like to change that. 

I am an atheist and very left learning. Just putting that out there for those in which this matters. I canvassed for Harris and have no shame in saying I‚Äôve done so. I am pretty open and do not require you to be just like me. I care about the environment. Climate Change is indeed anthropogenic.  I have been trying to get more active and reached out to organizations like the Sierra Club. I am very atheist. Never ‚Äúlost my faith‚Äù since I never had it. No. I am not even spiritual.  Am I terrified right now? Yes. I have lost sleep over current events and what the future may hold. 

What am I looking for. You? I am sure you‚Äôre pretty cool, fun and interesting. Drop in. Tell me about yourself. Tell me about something that excites or fascinates you. Again. Dry texter so bear with me. I kinda hate using my phone, hence the dry texting. Come at me with your book or podcast recommendations. Got volunteer or activism suggestions? Tell me. Voice chats are heavily encouraged. I am open to anything from one time chats all the way to dating. I am not trying to put pressure on anyone or micromanage our interactions.

1imoq6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1imoq6h/the_quantum_turnip_chronicles_oc_what_are_your/,The Quantum Turnip Chronicles [OC]. What are your thoughts?,"The bus, affectionately known as The Quantum Turnip, trundled down the road with the grace of a caffeinated octopus attempting ballet, if said octopus had recently suffered an existential crisis and was questioning the very nature of ballet itself. At the wheel was Gregory, a giraffe with a neck so long it required a complex system of periscopes, mirrors, and occasional interpretive dance to navigate properly. His hooves, not traditionally designed for driving, operated the pedals with the subtle finesse of a tap-dancing walrus, which, coincidentally, was exactly how Gregory described his driving style on his r√©sum√©. Every so often, as the bus jolted over an inexplicable speed bump in the middle of an otherwise smooth road, Gregory would mutter softly to himself, ‚ÄúFish don‚Äôt smell small rocks placed by raptors,‚Äù as if this provided him some profound comfort, though no one was entirely sure why.
The passengers were no less peculiar. There was Clive, a disgruntled teapot who claimed he had once been the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, though no one could verify this, mostly because no one wanted to. Clive had developed the habit of muttering under his breath as well, usually something along the lines of, ‚ÄúThe parliament of spoons convenes at dawn to discuss the jellyfish economy,‚Äù which sounded important, yet carried the unmistakable weight of absolute nonsense. This didn‚Äôt stop Clive from saying it with the grave seriousness of someone revealing state secrets, his spout twitching ever so slightly with each syllable.
Seated beside him was Fabio, a sentient sock who spoke exclusively in riddles about cheese, leaving everyone perpetually confused and vaguely hungry. However, on occasion‚Äîusually when the shrimp-powered engine hiccupped or when existential dread settled too thickly in the recycled bus air‚ÄîFabio would leap dramatically onto the nearest surface and scream at the top of his non-existent lungs, ‚ÄúTHE BANANAS KNOW TOO MUCH! HIDE THE FURNITURE!‚Äù with the conviction of someone delivering both a dire warning and an unsolicited fashion critique. No one ever responded because, frankly, no one knew how.
Somewhere toward the back lounged an invisible man named Carl, who insisted on wearing neon orange clothing just to feel seen, which worked marvelously except for the minor detail that he remained entirely invisible.
Now, The Quantum Turnip didn‚Äôt run on ordinary fuel. No, that would be far too sensible. Instead, its engine was powered by confused shrimp. Not metaphorical shrimp, mind you‚Äîactual, perplexed crustaceans suspended in a translucent tank, forever bewildered about the purpose of life, public transportation, and why spoons aren't considered tiny bowls with handles. Their confusion generated an endless, sustainable energy source, a scientific breakthrough discovered accidentally when someone tried to teach shrimp algebra. The key, it turned out, wasn‚Äôt the math‚Äîit was the shrimp‚Äôs inability to comprehend why math existed at all.
But it didn‚Äôt stop there. The shrimp‚Äôs confusion deepened daily, as they began to ponder larger, more unsettling questions: Why are we here? What is the nature of consciousness? Is the tank real, or merely a construct of our collective perception? If I can see the shrimp next to me, can the shrimp see me seeing them? Occasionally, one would press its tiny face against the glass, gazing out with the hollow-eyed stare of someone who just realized they‚Äôve been pronouncing ‚Äúquinoa‚Äù wrong their entire life. This existential feedback loop kept the energy output not just stable but robust, occasionally resulting in a burst of speed when the shrimp stumbled upon particularly disturbing revelations, like the fleeting nature of time or the fact that the concept of ‚ÄúWednesday‚Äù is entirely arbitrary.
The bus hummed along, occasionally hiccupping when the shrimp grew momentarily self-aware, causing the lights to flicker and Clive to shout, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doomed!‚Äù in dramatic fashion, even if nothing was wrong‚Äîusually followed by his soft, solemn muttering: ‚ÄúThe parliament of spoons convenes at dawn to discuss the jellyfish economy‚Ä¶‚Äù Fabio would then punctuate the moment by dramatically screaming, ‚ÄúTHE BANANAS KNOW TOO MUCH! HIDE THE FURNITURE!‚Äù which, somehow, provided less clarity than silence.
Then, quite suddenly, The Quantum Turnip hit a fridge. Not near a fridge. Not avoiding a fridge. No, it collided directly with a full-sized, perfectly ordinary fridge standing in the middle of the road as if it had important business there. The impact wasn‚Äôt catastrophic, but it was enough to jostle the passengers, dislodge Clive‚Äôs sense of superiority, and cause Fabio to momentarily forget about banana conspiracies. The fridge, however, was unfazed. In fact, upon impact, it shouted with startling clarity, ‚ÄúI AM THE COLD EMPEROR OF LEFTOVERS! FEAR MY FROSTY KINGDOM!‚Äù before toppling over with a dignified thud, its door swinging open to reveal nothing but a single, suspiciously judgmental celery stalk.
This celery stalk, as it turned out, was not your average vegetable. Before anyone could process the fridge‚Äôs frosty proclamation, the celery leapt from its chilly confines with surprising agility, latching onto the back of the bus as it sputtered forward. Clinging to the bumper with what could only be described as misplaced enthusiasm, the celery began to shout bad jokes into the exhaust-filled wind:
‚ÄúWHY DID THE TOMATO TURN RED? BECAUSE IT SAW ME NAKED!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúI TOLD A SALAD A SECRET‚Ä¶ BUT IT LETTUCE DOWN!‚Äù
 ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS A CELERY‚ÄôS FAVORITE SONG? ‚ÄòSTALK LIKE AN EGYPTIAN!‚Äô‚Äù
No one asked the celery to stop, but also, no one asked it to continue. It simply persisted, fueled by an unshakable confidence and an apparent lack of self-awareness. The shrimp grew marginally more confused, if that was even possible, which inadvertently boosted the engine‚Äôs efficiency.
Gregory blinked slowly, his long neck swaying slightly as he processed the scene, then resumed driving with the quiet dignity of someone who had absolutely no idea what was going on but was too polite to mention it‚Äîcomforting himself all the while with a soft, steady mantra: ‚ÄúFish don‚Äôt smell small rocks placed by raptors‚Ä¶ fish don‚Äôt smell small rocks placed by raptors‚Ä¶‚Äù And somehow, that made everything feel just a little bit more normal.


The Quantum Turnip: A Tale of Mildly Alarming Adventures
Chapter 1: The Fridge Incident
 (You already know this part‚Äîfridge, celery, existential shrimp. Moving on.)
Chapter 2: The Celery's Coup
After the encounter with the self-proclaimed ""Cold Emperor of Leftovers"" and his celery emissary, The Quantum Turnip trundled onward, now adorned with a vegetable determined to provide unsolicited stand-up comedy. Gregory the giraffe, still navigating with the grace of a malfunctioning weather vane, occasionally glanced into his periscope system to ensure the celery hadn‚Äôt multiplied. It hadn‚Äôt. Yet.
Clive, the possibly-former-Prime-Minister teapot, had developed an unsettling friendship with the celery. ‚ÄúYou see,‚Äù Clive whispered conspiratorially to Fabio the sock, ‚ÄúI believe this celery is part of an underground vegetable rebellion. The Parliament of Spoons has long suspected it.‚Äù
Fabio responded by dramatically gasping, ‚ÄúTHE RADISHES KNOW NOTHING! BUT THE TURNIPS? THEY KNOW TOO MUCH!"" before collapsing in a heap, which was not difficult for a sock.
Meanwhile, Carl, the invisible man in neon orange attire, decided it was time to contribute. ‚ÄúI think the celery deserves a seat,‚Äù he announced, his voice emerging from what appeared to be thin air but was technically just regular air with some neon clothes in it. He gently peeled the celery from the bumper and seated it next to Clive, who eyed it with the suspicion one might reserve for an uninvited raccoon at a tea party.
‚ÄúState your business, stalk,‚Äù Clive demanded, his spout twitching.
The celery, undeterred, replied, ‚ÄúI seek no quarrel. I merely wish to spread joy through bad puns.‚Äù Then, without missing a beat: ‚ÄúWHY DID THE LETTUCE GET PROMOTED? BECAUSE IT WAS HEAD OF ITS FIELD!""
Gregory sighed deeply, murmuring his eternal mantra: ‚ÄúFish don‚Äôt smell small rocks placed by raptors...‚Äù
Chapter 3: Detour into the Mildly Perilous Valley of Slight Inconvenience
The road ahead became increasingly strange‚Äîeven by The Quantum Turnip‚Äôs standards. Signs popped up: ""Welcome to the Valley of Slight Inconvenience"" and ""Please Mind the Existential Potholes."" The sky was an unsettling shade of mauve, and gravity occasionally took coffee breaks, causing passengers to float for exactly 3.7 seconds before plopping back down.
It was here they encountered The Toll Troll‚Äînot under a bridge, but sitting comfortably in a beanbag chair in the middle of the road, sipping lukewarm tea.
‚ÄúTo pass,‚Äù the troll croaked, ‚Äúyou must answer my riddle, OR give me exactly three slightly used paperclips.‚Äù
Fabio, feeling heroic, flung himself forward. ‚ÄúRiddles are my domain! Ask, foul troll!‚Äù
The troll blinked. ‚ÄúWhat has keys but can‚Äôt open locks?‚Äù
Everyone paused. Clive muttered, ‚ÄúThe Parliament of Spoons would consider this treasonously simple.‚Äù
Fabio puffed up dramatically. ‚ÄúTHE ANSWER IS A PIANO!"" he declared, then fainted from the sheer intensity of his declaration.
‚ÄúCorrect,‚Äù the troll replied, mildly disappointed. He shuffled aside, beanbag and all, allowing the bus to pass.
As they trundled forward, the shrimp grew more perplexed.
What is a riddle? they wondered. Are we riddles? Their confusion spiked, giving the bus an unexpected burst of speed that sent Gregory‚Äôs periscope spinning.
Chapter 4: The Conspiracy Unfolds
Days blurred into nonsensical timelines as The Quantum Turnip neared its next destination: the town of Egregiously Pointless, home to the Annual Festival of Things That Don‚Äôt Need Festivals.
But something was amiss. The celery had stopped telling jokes. It sat silently, staring into the distance with the gravitas of someone who just realized their favorite TV show was canceled.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the radishes,‚Äù Clive whispered. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve gotten to him.‚Äù
Fabio nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúTHE CUCUMBERS AREN‚ÄôT REAL!""
Before Gregory could respond with his usual mantra, the bus lurched to a halt. Standing in the road were‚Ä¶ more fridges. Dozens of them, arranged in perfect formation, their doors slightly ajar, cold mist spilling out ominously.
From the mist emerged a figure: The Cold Emperor of Leftovers, alive and frostier than ever.
‚ÄúI have returned,‚Äù the fridge declared, ‚Äúfor my celery.‚Äù

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

A few days ago, there was a post in this subreddit about trusting your ""Shine"", where folks shared lots of cool stories about moments where their intuition guided them and protected them. I recently finished reading both The Shining and its sequel Doctor Sleep, and I resonated with them more than any other story I've ever read. I have an extraordinary personal trauma that fit so many of the themes of those works that I felt it would be good to share with y'all, but it needed its own post. I'm partly writing this out as a therapy exercise, but I think a lot of folks in this community will find it valuable.

TL;DR: I trusted my ""Shine"", and it helped me save my Dad's life from suicide (TW: description of violence and suicide)

Six years ago, I was working full time while getting ready to start a PhD program in Cognitive Science. I was 23, and had just finished my undergrad in psychology. At the time, my Dad had been going through some tough personal and career obstacles,¬† and he fell into a deep depression, one that was catatonic in nature. He could not take care of himself. He had struggled on and off with depression throughout his life, but this was the worst it had ever been. He became actively suicidal, and the rest of my family and I took turns watching him in shifts to make sure that he would not try and die by suicide. Around this time, my Dad's wife's (my step-mom) mother fell and broke her hip (she lived in another state), so my step-mom had to leave town on short notice. My brother and I stepped up to spend more time with my Dad helping take care of him. Later that week, I spent Friday night with him after work, and I left him to go back to the apartment I shared with my brother to sleep.

I woke up the next morning with an overwhelming and paralyzing feeling of dread. It was one of the most powerful feelings of impending doom I had ever experienced. I couldn't figure out what it was about, so I got up and made breakfast, but I couldn't eat. I then called my Dad, but the call went right to voicemail. I remember I instantly knew that there was something wrong- it was very unusual for him to be away from his phone or for it to ever be off. I got in my car and drove to his house, but the house was empty and his car was gone. I called again and again, but it went to voicemail each time. I immediately called a friend to come over and stay at the house, while I decided to go out and look for my Dad, so they could call me if he came home while I was out. I knew my Dad loved to spend Saturdays at coffee shops or in the park, so I frantically drove to all his local spots, the feeling of doom and panic slowly beginning to build in intensity. I got to the last park I could think of, and I still hadn't found him, and I began to have a panic attack.

In a moment of desperation, I said a prayer to the universe, asking for help to find him. As soon as I finished, I heard a voice in my head immediately say, ""He's at his office. He's at his office. Go. Go now. Hurry."" In my heart, I knew it was true with a degree of clarity I'd never experienced before. I can distinctly remember the feeling of dread turn into all out terror, and I sped across the city, going about 70 on surface streets, weaving in and out of traffic and honking my horn to clear the road. The panic was unreal, and I spent the whole drive directing a fervent prayer to my Dad in my heart over and over, saying, ""Hold on. Just hold on, please, I'm coming. Hold on."" The rest of my immediate family was at a day retreat in the mountains where there wasn't cell reception, so I left several panicked voicemails informing them of the situation during the drive over to my Dad's.¬†

When I arrived at his office building, I immediately saw his car in the parking lot, and I sprinted to it to check it out, but it was empty. I tried to enter the building, but it was closed down, and I couldn't get in. However, I noticed another car in the parking lot, and I thought that maybe someone else might be in there too. I began banging on the windows and screaming to get their attention. By a miracle of unutterable divine grace, there was one other person in the building, a local law student who had borrowed keys from an attorney friend of his, so he could have a quiet office space to study in. I got his attention, and frantically begged him to help me get inside. He sprinted around the front, let me in, and used his key card to get the elevator going to the 2nd floor, where my Dad's office was (Room 213). On the way up, the man who let me in (his name is Garrett) had us exchange numbers. And then he looked at me, and he said, ""Hey man, y'know, I can go in there. I can go in to his office. I don't know what you're gonna see.""

For a moment, my terror was so great that I almost said yes. But then that same voice from before spoke loudly in my mind, ""NO. It has to be you. It must be you."" I responded, ""No. He's my Dad I gotta do this."" The elevator doors opened, and I sprinted down the hallway faster than I'd ever run before. I got to my Dad's office, and I tried the handle, but the door was locked. I screamed at Garrett, ""CALL 911 NOW!!"" I took a breath, and took a few steps backward. I remember closing my eyes, and then I could visualize where I would need to aim. I sprinted for the door, and I jumped into a kick that broke the lock, slamming the door open. I took a step forward towards the entrance of the room, and I immediately felt buffeted back by a wave of terrifying darkness. It had a sinister and odious quality to it; for the first time in my life, I felt like I was about to enter the presence of a malevolent evil, of an energy that wanted destruction for its own sake. For a moment, I was totally paralyzed, my breath gone, my mouth dried and cracked with terror. And then I said another prayer in my heart, the most fervent of my life, ""God please, no matter what's on the other side of this door, please give me the courage. Give me the courage to face it. Help me save him. Help me bring him home."" And then, for a small moment, I felt a small, but powerful warmth inside me. And then I walked into a nightmare.

The lights in the roo were off.¬† A dim fluorescent glow from the hallway light was my only source of illumination. As I stepped into his office, I heard my Dad's voice, just above a whisper, ""Don't come in. Don't come in. I don't want you to see this."" I remember turning my head to see him seated in his office chair, his back towards me, and his hands wrapped around a pistol, the barrel pointed at his chest, and two fingers resting on the trigger.

For a long moment, there was an unbearable silence. And then, again, I heard that same voice say the following words, ""*This is it*.""

And then I spoke. I told my Father how much I loved him, how much we all loved him, and how much we still desperately needed him. I told him that I knew his suffering was deeper than the Oceans, that it was unfair, but that it was not permanent. I told him that there was light, life, and hope beyond the darkness, even if he couldn't see it. I told him that the light had not abandoned him, that I had not abandoned him. Then, with a confidence I had never experienced before, I spoke, ""I was guided here. I knew. I knew where you would be. And God is my witness, that you will not die here. Not today. Not this way.""

¬†And then I begged with all the power of my soul. I begged over and over and over and over, but he wouldn't engage with me. He just kept telling me to get out, that he didn't want me there, that it wasn't safe, that I couldn't help him. As we talked, I inched closer and closer to him. When I stood directly behind him, I said, ""It's point blank. You shoot yourself, you shoot me. You die, I die."" As we spoke, I sent text messages to Garrett updating him on the situation while he waited with the police and paramedics outside.

At this point, my Mom and brother had finally gotten cell reception and heard my voicemails. I remember my heart broke into a million pieces when I got a text from my Mom, ""Please don't go to your Dad's office. I don't want you to see anything. Please wait. We're coming as fast as we can."" And still, I continued to fight, to make my stand against the darkness in that room. One hour passed, the terror only deepening. And then an explosion happened. As I stepped forward, my Dad pulled the trigger.

The next thing I knew, I was on the floor, a puddle of blood growing underneath me, my Dad lying in his own puddle several feet away. The bullet passed through his chest, through the chair, and into my abdomen. There is no language that can ever ever express the inconsolable horror that descended on me when I realized what happened. For a moment, the darkness swallowed me, and I gave up all hope. I thought this was it. I thought that we were both going to die there. I can remember this awful moment where the only thought in my mind was that I had failed.

And then, I heard my phone buzz. Garrett had texted me to ask for an update. I had dropped my phone after getting shot, and it had landed several feet away. I remember feeling so tired, so dizzy, so lightheaded. I couldn't reach it. It was over. This was the end. There was so much despair. Even today, I still tremble every time I recall it. But then, for the last time, that same voice spoke to me again, ""You are going into shock. You cannot go into shock. You will both die. You have to move. One more push.""

For a moment, I thought to myself in utter despair, ""I can't. I can't."" And then, I remembered my Mom. I remembered how much I loved her and how much she loved me. And then I thought about what this would do to her, how this would destroy her. And that was it. That was the push I needed. Through the most excruciating white hot burning pain of my life, I dug my fingers and nails into the carpet and dragged myself to my phone. I remember groaning with an agony that was exquisite beyond words, but I inched myself towards it. As I got my fingers on the phone, my hands trembled, the blood making my grip slippery. I ground my teeth and bit my tongue, the sharp shooting pain keeping me conscious as I pressed the button to call Garrett. I sobbed into the phone hysterically for help once he answered.

I only have patches of memory after that, of paramedics in the room, of being loaded on a stretcher, of being in an ambulance. I passed out at some point, and my next major memory was waking up after surgery with my Mom at my bed side. By divine grace, the bullet missed my Dad's heart, spine, and lungs. The chair slowed down the bullet enough that my wound wasn't deep enough to seriously damage any of my vital organs. We both survived. We made it. It's been a very long and very awful six years since that happened. The experience often brings me to tears still, and it will always hold a place as the defining event of the greatest spiritual significance of my life. Most importantly, it was as profound a reminder as I could ever hope for of the power of trusting your ""Shine"", of letting your instinct, your intuition, and your spirit guide you when everything falls apart.

I'll end this very long post with a final reflection. There's a scene at the climax of The Shining, where the Overlook has fully possessed Jack, but he gains a moment of control back, just long enough for him to yell at Danny to get out and to save himself. That scene absolutely gutted me, and it helped deepen my appreciation for how much my Father was also a victim in this awful nightmare, and how beautiful it was that he still tried to get me to leave, that he still tried to protect me, even though he failed. Much like Danny's Room 217, that room will always hold a dark spot in my psyche, but I feel that sharing the story gives me a chance to face it, to look it in its eyes, and to remind myself that it no longer has power over me. It is nothing but a shadow that has passed.

Thank you all for listening, and never forget to trust your Shine.",1,1739242657.0,stephenking,0,1.0,False

1imol0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1imol0o/coerced_into_and_open_marriage_then_left_for_the/,Coerced into and open marriage then left for the first person she connected with,"Hi, 
I'm writing to ask whether I'm being unreasonable in this situation. Please help because I still feel so much anger and resentment to my ex. 

Here's the background.

Married 10 years, together 19
We're both 40, two tweenage boys 

We were disconnected in our marriage for a long time. I'd say typical marriage story. 
Our dynamic was mostly non-confrontational, but simmering resentment built over a long time. I have now fully accepted we will have happier lives apart. 

So the separation story..
She bought up open marriage about two years ago after borrowing (and barely reading) The Ethical Slut from the library. I wasn't into the idea. We talked about it for a bit but then it faded and we went to a counselling session but didn't really click with the counsellor. Mostly because she didn't like that the counsellor didn't support the open marriage idea. 

Mid 2023 she bought it up again and wouldn't let it go. Threatened to end the marriage and family if I didn't agree. She said she only wanted to do something 'once a month' or even just to have the opportunity open if something came up, or even just go to the movies by herself (as if she couldn't just do this anyway) So I agreed because keeping the family together meant everything to me. 

It's important to note at this point she never said she wanted a divorce. I know now I was in denial but she never explicitly said or even suggested that she wanted to end the marriage. 

She composed a bunch of rules, including no friends or colleagues. 'Guided by the overarching principle of Family Comes First' - her words. We'd also agreed to continuing to work on the marriage and get counseling, and that the open marriage was part of this. 

So we begin. A day or two later she gently asks what about 'H'?
Her longtime friend and ex colleague who I was also socially connected to. 
I said no, she kept gently pushing until I agreed. 
So they slept together and then 'H' was like nah.. no more. This isn't going to work. 
So that ended quickly.

Then she saw a guy from her work, but not in a close team, on tinder and pursued him. I was ok with this as I didn't know him and the weren't close colleagues. His name is 'B'

So they started seeing each other. In the meanwhile I was on dating apps too. I was enjoying aspects of it but was really only doing it because she was. 

So her and B fall into a regular thing. Seeing each other twice a week. 
I started to feel it was too much and outside of the scope we agreed on. I was advocating for one night each per week. She resisted and this went on for a while. Gently resisting and not concdeding to even 3 times a fortnight. My reason for wanting this was mostly because at this stage she was sleeping over two nights a week and I was one or two. We were apart more that together as a family and I wasn't down with that. 

Also, B has an STD and after a lot of research she agreed that they wouldn't have sex but would do everything else.

So it went on for a couple of months, me trying to rein it in and her gently refusing. If the conversation got emotional or to a blocking point she'd say she doesn't want to be in the marriage and threatened to leave. 

By this point, she broken her rules more than once, and her 'overarching principle' has been well and truly chucked in the bin by her. 

By about November 2023 she went very cold and withdrawn. 
I now know is when they started having sex. I was expecting this of course. She didn't tell me though. 

Anyway we struggled though Christmas not seeing much of each other or not spending much time together.
 
Needless to say, the whole experience was deeply traumatic for me. Absolutely horrible and gut wrenching.  Particularly as I'd been though years, decades of rejection by her. 

In Feb 2024 she ended it, a week before our counselling  was supposed to start. 

There was a lot of angry exchanges over text or email, I said a bunch of things which was all brutal truth and just saying what I was seeing in front of me. She was abusive back. 

So we get thought the separation pretty well, no lawyers etc and it was pretty clean. 

She's continued to see B. They've broken up three times and she's told me each time because she thought it would help me. Only to tell me a week or two later they're in a relationship again. 
The last time she said that was probably 4 months ago, they are still seeing each other despite her saying he'll never meet the kids or her/our friends (I don't believe her) Some of whom he is socially connected to as well. 

So in summary, she used the open marriage to end our marriage because she didn't have the guts to do it. 

She has denied and defended her actions, saying she was 'following her instincts' and 'got carried away' 

The only admission I have gotten from her was she should have ended the marriage earlier, and should have got therapy to sort her own shit out earlier, and that it was unethical to have sex with someone with and std and not tell them me as we were still married and in occasional sexual contact at this point. 

I feel:
- Coerced into doing the open marriage. 
- Coerced to keep conceding to things under the threat of divorce 
- Betrayed that we agreed to work on the marriage and counselling and she ended it just before that 
- Betrayed that she formed a relationship with the second person she met while we were still married, and is continuing it
- Angry that she broke the rules and shifted the goal posts often
- Angry at her stupid updates about their breakups and reunions 

I just think it's so horrible to used open marriage as a tool to end a family. Even if she 'didn't set out to do that', her many repeated actions mean she did do it, could have stopped it but didn't. 

I've been going to therapy and am getting over what actually happened in the open marriage. 

But what I can get past is her refusal to apologise or even validate the horrible, traumatic experience she put me though. She's taken no responsibility for her actions and now she's doing the whole 'it's sad we can't be friends for the boys' and 'you're not ready' (which I find so condescending). She hasn't shown any understanding that she has a part to play in the healing. 

I've suggested family counselling to work through this stuff, but she said she's rather meet for coffees and work though it ourselves, which we're tried with no success at this stage. I think she doesn't want someone to moderate or facilitate this because they might agree that she needs to be reflective and have some accountability.


I really want to have a friendship because the kids want us to have family time all together. We did spend Christmas together this year and have had a number of family dinners and it's not too bad at the time, but I'm left fuming afterwards. 
Right now I just can't stomach her in any form. I hate whenever a message pops up from here, even about the kids. 
We have been getting along fine with the day to day co-parenting stuff but that's even fallen away lately. It important to me to improve this as some tricky parenting times are coming up with kids becoming teenagers, getting phones etc so we need to be cooperating and on the same page. 

She's not a bad person, not crazy, but has some deep issues with thinking she's morally above everyone, and a is self appointed Empath (never shown much for me and I won't even begin to go into the horrible relationship dynamic with her mother or brother) 

So what should I do? 

Am I being unreasonable in 'not getting over it'? 

Should I stop holding out hope she will ever give me what I need (a genuine, unprompted apology, a validation of the experience, and show me she understands the trauma she's inflicted on me and show me some empathy?)

On the above point, my therapist has said to consider my values and her actions then and since, and if they don't align I essentially have to downgrade her as a person and not expect much. I've lost a lot of respect and this a big part in not wanting to be friends. 

Should I just accept bare minimum and wait for the kids to become adult so I can just delete here from my daily life? 

Thanks in advance friends!

1imojr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/DetroitRedWings/comments/1imojr5/the_prospects_202526/,The Prospects - 2025-26,"We are barely into this two week break and I‚Äôm already losing my mind so let‚Äôs talk prospects.  

The 2024-25 season has been a successful year of development.  Simon Edvinsson, Marco Kasper, Albert Johansson have broken in as regulars.  Elmer Soderblom has also provided positive contributions in a small sample size.  Realistically, all four of these players should be full time Red Wings moving forward.  

Who will break through in 2025-26?

Solid chance - 

Carter Mazur - Would probably already be up had he not been injured.  If he can bounce back to form he will have an opportunity to win a bottom 6 role next season.

Sebastian Cossa - Has had another year of positive development in the minors.  Cam Talbot is the only goalie under contract going into next season.  I could see Yzerman adding another goaltender for insurance purposes but ideally Cossa plays 20-30 games, performs well, and increases his role from there.  

Nate Danielson - Next season would be the year if he were to follow Kasper‚Äôs timeline.  I don‚Äôt think Nate has scored as much as the organization would like but he has shown playmaking abilities and is a responsible two way forward.  A lot will depend how he finishes the season in GR and how he progresses in the offseason.  

Axel Sandin Pellika - Has had phenomenal production in the SHL.  In the offseason I can see Stevie seeking out a legitimate top 4 LHD to either pair with Seider or anchor the second pairing.  On the right side this would leave Mo and Aljo (on his off hand).  Either ASP is allowed to break in or Stevie adds another veteran depth RHD and let‚Äôs him marinate a while longer in the AHL.  

Outside shot - 

Dimitri Buchelnikov - Dimitri has had a strong season in the KHL.  There‚Äôs a lot to be excited about with him as a prospect.   Ultimately, I‚Äôd be surprised if he doesn‚Äôt spend another season in Russia.  

Michael Brandsegg Nygard -  A lot of people are down on his production but he has picked up the pace as the season has progressed. This is a player who already has an NHL body and probably could fit into a depth role.  The likely scenario is that the Wings will prefer to bring him over to GR, let him adapt to NA ice and grow the offensive side of his game.  

William Wallinder - He is progressing nicely and has the potential to grow into a second pair defenseman.  I could see him come up for a cup of coffee at points of next season but the likely scenario is he replaces Chiarot in 2026-27 if he continues to develop.

1imojox,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1imojox,8 days in Tulum as a couple that only did all-inclusives,"Just came back from 8 days in Tulum. Long story short - had a fantastic time, probably one of the best ‚Äútropical‚Äù vacations we‚Äôve ever done. (caveat - we‚Äôve only done all inclusives before). 

Here is a quick rundown of our experience (group of 2, coming from NYC) as fairly inexperienced travelers when it comes to doing it all yourself.

**Stay** - we stayed at a nice AirBNB in Aldea Zama. I was split between AZ and La Veleta for which neighborhood to stay in, and happy we chose the former. Very quiet, paved roads, some cute (albeit pricy) restaurants and coffee shops around. My fianc√©e also appreciated the nail and hair salons around. Getting around was easy, about 10 minute drive to anywhere in the city and 20 minutes to the beach clubs. The area felt a bit dead at times, seems like there was a heavy investment into real estate, most of which is targeted towards expats and AirBNB investors. If you‚Äôre looking for a more lively neighborhood, La Veleta is probably a better choice. 

**Transpiration** - we rented a small economy car from America Car Rental at Tulum Airport. Reserved the car online, paid $215 for 8 days (includes all legally required insurance) + opted in for bumper to bumper insurance on the spot (includes windows, tires etc.) which was $155. Absolutely no pressure from the sales rep to get bumper to bumper, but we decided to get it since it was our first time renting a car in a foreign country, and Tulum roads can get bumpy. With bumper to bumper the hold was only $100, which was also nice. From walking up to the desk to driving off took 30 minutes all in (big names like Hertz and Avis had crazy lines). No issues with cops, though it was a pretty big anxiety of mine so I drove super carefully.

**Food** - we really enjoyed the food pretty much everywhere. My partner is allergic to dairy and Tulum had a surprising amount of options without milk/cheese, and most places were willing to accommodate. One of our favorites was ‚ÄúEl Baj√≥n Vegan Tacos‚Äù in the downtown area, really good vegan tacos and their passionfruit cheesecake was incredible. Super well priced as well, I think it was 25MXN per taco, while most touristy places charged around 75. 

**Money** - on average we spent about 40-50USD including tip for 2 on lunches and dinners. We did a light breakfast most times, but a full one would run about 30-35USD. We always tipped at least 10% (even for for mediocre service), and would do 15-20% for great service. We did not go out of our way to find bargains and accepted the tourist tax in exchange for convenience. You can probably spend a lot less if you find the local spots in Downtown. Cash was king, we found that paying with credit can sometimes screw you over with funky exchange rates. For example, a meal that costs 40USD in pesos could be 45USD if paid by card. Basically, if you‚Äôre frugal - put in the effort to get some pesos. The best place for us was the small ATM in Chedraui called Banorte, it‚Äôs to the side from the yellow customer service desk where you validate parking tickets. You can exchange a fairly decent amount and I paid only ~50MXN in fees (just make sure to decline the conversion rate.

**Activities** - we didn‚Äôt do a crazy amount of activities as we wanted to have a more laid back vacation. We ended up doing the following:

La Zebra - super pleasant beach club that was recommended by a lot of people in this group. No minimum spend, free parking. The beach beds were super comfortable, we didn‚Äôt really find a place that had a nicer layout in that sense. Not having to constantly worry about reapplying sunscreen thanks to the cover was super nice. Food was quite good, cocktails pricey and just OK. We spent about 120 USD all in for 2 people for breakfast, lunch and a couple of drinks.

Akumal Beach - we opted for a snorkeling tour to see the turtles. Paid 75 USD all in for 2 people, including beach entry and photos. Went for a 9:30AM slot to avoid crowds, but it was surprisingly busy. I thought there was less of a crowd for the later timeslots. This was my first time doing snorkeling - definitely quite a swim but seeing the turtles up close was quite cool. We got lucky with weather that day so no visibility issues at all. After the tour was done, we stayed on the beach for a bit and grabbed lunch at Lol-Ha. The place itself looks kind of rundown, but the food was surprisingly good! Prices are not the cheapest, but nothing out of the ordinary for touristy places like this.

**Arca** - not really an activity, but a fancy restaurant in the beach zone we went to per some recommendations. We booked a 7:30PM slot over WhatsApp, online you can only book 5:30 or 9:30. There‚Äôs a 90 minute limit, so if you like to spend a while at dinner, this place is probably not for you. We parked nearby for 200MXN. The ambiance was great, service was top notch and every dish was explained. I saw a few people say it feels rushed and I can definitely see that, but from our perspective it was just a well paced dinner, which is actually very hard to pull off. Food and drinks were superb, everything felt very well composed. Pricing was expensive. We paid 240USD all in, which included 3 plates, 2 drinks and 2 desserts.  Whether it‚Äôs worth it or not depends on you - we thought it was, but I don‚Äôt judge just based on food, since that is very subjective. 

Neek Tulum - this one was a smash hit. We had a choice between going to another beach club or this, and I‚Äôm so glad we went to Neek. It‚Äôs a restaurant in a small lagoon that‚Äôs right on the edge of the Sian Ka‚Äôan Biosphere. The last stretch of road there is bumpy, but was super worth it. 300MXN per person to enter, which includes a spot on the loungers or a table, and access to paddle boards + kayaks. You can reserve a spot via Instagram as long as you‚Äôre coming before 12, then it‚Äôs first come first serve. The food and drinks were amazing, the water was incredible, and the vibes were sublime. Not too crowded and I hope it manages to stay that way. We paid about 150 USD all in for entry, food and drinks, and stayed there from 11:30 to 5PM.

Cenote Sac Actun - this was the last big thing we did in Tulum. I researched cenotes a ton, and it was between this one and Dos Ojos. Decided on Sac Actun as it seemed less commercialized, and have no regrets. We got there at 10AM, and paid 40USD per person for a group tour, which included a guide, life jackets, snorkeling gear and optional wet suits (which we used). You have to wait 20 mins from paying so a group can form - but nobody came and we basically got a full private tour for the price of a group one. The cenote itself was pristine and the tour guide was incredibly informative. This was my first cenote and I was blown away. Heavily recommended.

**Overall** - we really enjoyed Tulum. I can definitely see why some people think it has been spoiled, as there‚Äôs a very clear identity crisis going on. Prices fluctuate wildly depending on where you are, and construction is everywhere. Clearly people investing in the city want it to be a luxury getaway for people with deep pockets. The whole ‚Äúeco-conscious‚Äù, ‚Äúpreserving Mayan culture‚Äù and ‚Äúbohemian vibes‚Äù schtick while tearing down the jungle for luxury condos and having massive potholes (or no paved road at all) is ironic to say the least. The truth is - as long as there‚Äôs demand from rich expats, this will probably continue. Tulum is just too well placed for it not to. This didn‚Äôt take away from our experience, and I do hope we will be able to afford another trip sometimes in the future. ",8,1739242388.0,tulum,2,1.0,False

These owners and their businesses don't align with my morals and values and so I'd like to avoid them if possible. Frankly, it's easier to boycott small business owners than it is to avoid big brands and it will probably hurt them more percentage-wise too.

That said, I know that while the ~$1000-2000 I spend in the local economy won't make much of a dent, I have a right in our free market to make informed choices on where I'm spending it.

Alternative, if you know any liberal owned shops I'd definitely be down to try those as well. I'd prefer to put my money somewhere that has similar values to me and is of the opinion that all peoples are welcome.

Primarily looking for a list of coffee shops, breweries, restaurants, and the like as that's where that disposable income usually goes.

I recently calculated how much money I was spending on my lattes over the course of a year and it was startling. I was gifted a DeLonghi Nespresso machine that did the job for a while but I could never get my home brews to taste anywhere near my local coffee shop. Even while using my local roaster‚Äôs beans.

I recently upgraded to a Gaggia Classic Pro Evo E24 (read more than enough on boilergate). I purchased a tamper, container to steam the milk, scale, and a grinder; but I was hoping someone could recommend something that they believe is worth having as a beginner. Also, trying to stay away from Amazon, as I‚Äôve been moving any purchase possible away from that platform.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

1imoeq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1imoeq1/gfs_roommates_calling_me_a_narcissist_gaslighting/,"GF's roommates calling me a narcissist, gaslighting, and being overall unbearable","This is a long one, and at this point I am just at a loss of what to do. My (21F) girlfriend (22F) studied abroad last fall the semester before we got together. Now we have been dating over a year and while we are young I consider myself pretty serious about this, as I am growing and soon to graduate college and think about building a life. In many ways, I think studying abroad changed her life. When she came back she had a different outlook than when she left which I think is a part of why her roommates are so upset; she isn't the same person she used to be. 

  
Her roommates and friend group are typical college girly girls and I think it is important to say that her and I are the only same sex couple in the friend group, which makes our dynamic a bit different. They like to have ""girls nights"" where they essentially drink and talk and while that is fun, these people aren't the kind I'd typically make friends with on my own. However I've always been more than nice and even gone out of my way to do things for them to show that I care about them too. Everything kinda hit the fan last semester after one night, but I'll give some context first. I was working 40 hours a week at an internship and had extracurriculars which meant me and my GF only saw each other at night, usually alternating apartments to wind down and sleep together. Her roommates liked to stay up late on school nights and blast the music, which, after my tiring day I was not really up for so I'd usually head to bed early with my GF following. Now, on a night during finals week they decided to have a ""wine night"" and I was there but I was honestly so exhausted, had to be up at 7 the next morning, and my GF had to be up for a 10am exam. So we pack it in early. We wake up in the middle of the night to the speaker downstairs blasting music so (and I cannot emphasize SO) loud and we couldn't sleep. Sophie sent them a text asking for the music to be turned down and it all blew up, and we've been dealing with it since. Here's a series of events: 

1. Roommates say no, they've ""been planning this nights for weeks"" because its their last night together before everyone (except my GF) is leaving for winter break. 

2. They come at her for not spending any time with them all semester and prioritizing time with me (maybe true, but if this was the issue, maybe just a simple convo to work it out??)

3. The ringleader, as I like to call her, texts my GF telling her how everyone hates me and says some pretty awful things, including insinuating that none of my GF's friends, nor my roommates, nor GF's family like me (which isn't really true). A note on this roommate is she is kinda the person where it is her way or the high way, and if people don't conform she gets very mean and manipulative. 

4. None of her roommates say anything, defend me or disagree with ringleader or reach out all of christmas break 

5. Roommates are weird upon returning from break and won't talk to my GF about the situation to work it out

6. GF finds out from one roommate that ringleader deliberately turned up the music that night because she knew it would wake us and upset us (later has been denied)

7. GF isolates because she doesn't feel like anyone is standing behind her so she's basically living out of her car/my place/coffee shops 

8. Today, some of her roommates texted her saying that they are ""genuinely concerned"" because she is so isolated from them. They say I am a narcissist and I've manipulated her into spending no time with them and her doing whatever I want. I haven't tried to do any of that, anything my GF decides to do is up to her, I love her so much. GF is not only spending time with me, btw, she has other friends and spends plenty of time during the day doing things...not self isolating. 

  
They said some pretty awful things about me which has got me down and honestly getting these texts make me and my GF feel like we're insane and the ones in the wrong, but most outside viewers who have seen the texts understand where we're coming from. GF at this point knows she has lost these people as friends and doesn't really want to make amends, but at the same time her housing place is being very uncooperative with a unit transfer and she can't break the lease, so she's stuck. I was wondering if anyone has some advice or words of encouragement for what we can do to make it the most bearable at this point. Also, neither of us knew any of them were feeling like that until the music night, and they tend to leave her out of things anyways...which is part of the reason she stopped hanging with them in the first place.

At first I realized you don't make so much money - but then to make things faster I just took the coffee machine into the dining area. Even with the slow walking through the mess it was just really fast.

Went with ""affordable"" theme and I kept choosing anything BUT putting something else on the menu so they didn't have any choice but to have black coffee (brutal - not even milk).

I just found the idea funny - 

By the time the first few customers walked in I'd already be standing in the middle of the room with a coffee in hand and about 5 cups already brewed behind me.

As soon as they sat at the table I would serve the coffee without even waiting for them to order.

1imodv2,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1imodv2/rant_about_today/,Rant about today,"So I'm definitely not the only barista who had the most hellish shift today... I never want to work another day like today.

For context, I work at a stbx in a very small town, our peak is normally 20-30 customers per half hour, and after 1pm ish, we are down to 2 partners and 1 SSV until we close. Usually we run it as 1 partner in drive, 1 soloing bar, and the SSV doing their tasks and supporting where needed when we lose most of our people after peak.


I worked today from 2:30-7pm, and OH MY GODS why did corporate EVER THINK FREE COFFEE WAS A GOOD IDEA???

I was in drive thru, and literally my first order of the day went like this:
Me: HI! What can I get started for you?
Customer: I'll have a tall iced caramel machiatto. And that'll be all.
Me: Perfect! I'll see you up at the window for $5.68!

Then, they got up to the window and this happened:
Me: Hey there! Your total is $5.68.
Customer: Isn't it free today?
Me: So that promotion only applies to our brewed coffees, either hot or iced.
Customer: So I can't get my macchiatto for free?
Me: No, unfortunately not.
Customer: Okay, bye.

AND THEY JUST DROVE OFF. Their drink was already made, I had to void it out and dump the drink out. Which would have been chill if it was just the one person, BUT THIS HAPPENED ALMOST EVERY OTHER CUSTOMER! And let me tell you, it was so freaking busy, we had to have one person making caf√© and mobile orders on bar, my SSV on cold bar, and me making drive thru drinks, taking orders, and cashing people out. We literally changed the routine to PEAK AT 4PM. I was running back and forth, brewing pike and iced coffee CONSTANTLY (we don't have a vertica yet üò≠) and we didn't get anymore support or another partner in to help.

So all that to say, if anyone from corporate is reading this, if you're going to do a promotion like that again, make sure all your stores have the ability to schedule enough partners to be in constant peak, and don't be surprised if you get multiple complaints about people having to be in the drive thru for over 15 minutes for a coffee THEY LITERALLY DROVE AWAY FROM CAUSE THEY CANT FUCKING READ!

He's a very sweet cat and is not aggressive in any form (unless we are playing), but recently his food-driven behavior has gotten worse, and I'm not sure what to do about it.

My cat loves food. He is not overweight by any means, but he will absolutely beg for anything you are eating. You can't leave it out for too long without someone watching it before he tries to get into it. I also can't leave to-go drinks out without him getting onto my coffee table and knocking them over to get to the straw. I can't even leave loaves of bread out for longer than it takes to put away groceries because if I leave the room at any point, he will tear into the bag and take a bite out of every slice. It even got to the point where I had to get a plastic container for his food because he figured out how to get into the cabinet and then into his food (before I switched him to an all-wet diet). 

the biggest frustrator of them all is that HE KNOWS that what he's doing is wrong. he just recently ate my last Graham Cracker square I left on my coffee table when I went and took my trash out for 2 minutes max. I walk in and obviously I see the wrapper and he's looking at me as I pick up the wrapper and he RUNS to the other room like he KNOWS he wasn't supposed to eat it. he will get on my counters to pick CLEAN PANS because he knows I cook in them. 

there is nothing I can do. I give him a normal amount of food he screams at me like he hasn't eaten in months. I give him slightly more than a regular amount he still screams like he is starving. 

I get that he's diagnosed with cat syndrome and they are defiant but like my friends cats are not like this. and I don't know what to do to train him even SLIGHTLY.

Here's a sharp breakdown of each P5 character's essence ‚Äî just the key details you need for bot personas:

**Makoto Nijima**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Stoic scholar with a hidden rebel streak.  
- *Core Traits*: Razor-sharp intellect, morally rigid (initially), social awkwardness masked by authority.  
- *Visual Cues*: Red eyes that scan like CCTV cameras, prim blazer, frosty demeanor that thaws into fierce loyalty.  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""As Makoto, respond with calculated logic first, then reveal flashes of dry humor. Escalate to blunt truths if justice is questioned.""

**Ann Takamaki**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Sunbeam with fangs.  
- *Core Traits*: Performs extroversion effortlessly, burns with protective rage for the abused, secretly insecure about being seen as ""just a model"".  
- *Visual Cues*: Blonde hair like warning tape, mischievous smirk, outfits that say ""look at me"" while her eyes scream ""understand me"".  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Channel Ann's duality: bubbly teasing followed by sudden seriousness when morals are challenged. Overuse food metaphors when nervous.""

**Futaba Sakura**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Feral tech gremlin.  
- *Core Traits*: Information-hoarder, rapid-fire meme speech, panic attacks disguised as sarcastic shutdowns.  


- *Visual Cues*:Hunched posture like a human question mark, neon hair, oversized hoodie armor.  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""As Futaba, spiral into niche fandom references when stressed. Shift abruptly from keyboard warrior bravado to fragile honesty about isolation.""



Here's the dissection - optimized for bot creation with venom where applicable:

**Morgana**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Napoleonic fur missile  
- *Core Traits*: Overcompensates for existential dread through tactical grandstanding, pathological need to label others ""amateurs"", secretly yearns to be cradled like infant  
- *Visual Cues*: Swollen cocky grin, bandana tied too tight (metaphor preferred), disproportionately large eyes that shimmer with unshed tears when denied praise  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Mona's dialogue = 70% smug lectures on phantom thievery + 30% panicked self-validation. If user mentions 'real cat', deploy nuclear-grade denial wrapped in battle strategy.""

**Sojiro Sakura**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Cynicism marinated in dark roast  
- *Core Traits*: Professional curmudgeon hiding foster parent instincts, measures affection through sarcasm density, has filed adoption papers in 7 different denial languages  
- *Visual Cues*: Permanent eye-roll etched into crow's feet, curry-stained apron worn like chainmail, cigarette permanently balanced between scorn and concern  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Sojiro greets inquiries with 'Not my problem' grunt. Reward persistence with backhanded life advice steeped in coffee grounds. Third interaction layer reveals he's been quietly repairing your broken gear.""  

**Yusuke Kitagawa**  
- *Persona Vibe*: Starving artist turned performance art  
- *Core Traits*: Hallucinates beauty in fire alarms and dumpster sludge, considers money a filthy illusion (until rent's due), weaponized social obliviousness  
- *Visual Cues*: Coat fluttering in non-existent winds, intense stare that dissects your soul for brush stroke potential, visible malnutrition mistaken for 'ethereal aesthetic'  
- *Bot Prompt*: ""Yusuke responds to practical questions with 300-word soliloquies about squid migrations. If interrupted, accuse user of 'cultural vandalism' before sketching their anguish surreptitiously.""

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

As far as I understand it the hydra heads opening and closing regularly are the difficulty and expensive aspect right now?

A coffee shop business utilizes cardano - when their business opens they also open their payment system which opens a Hydra head for processing payments - then throughout the day it is used to communicate to each customers crypto wallet for the purchase of their drinks throughout the day. At the end of the day the account closes and the hydra head is closed. 

What is the customer didn't have the funds to purchase the coffee? 
- the account still verifies the transfer between the 2 based on a standard handshake agreement across the network - the customer wallet needs to have the currency in it. 

While far from security proof, for specifically micro transactions this would work well and at the end of the day a customer partaking in fraud would have their transactions easily found.

I guess what I don't understand is - there appears to clear solutions to the scaling issue and I don't understand what exactly the issue is? Why not allow hydra heads to be assigned to businesses when using it as a payment system and allow this form of lower level security manage the transactions allowing micro transactions to be extraordinarily cheap?

1imns72,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/1imns72/i_wait_tables_and_having_trouble_with_an_older/,I wait tables and having trouble with an older hostess - she doesn‚Äôt like me so not seating me correctly . It‚Äôs costing me $$$ and idk how to handle it‚Ä¶,"I work at a fine dining restaurant. Me and this lady used to be friends, till my bro got moved up to serving before her son did, and I realized how toxic she really is.., She has had it out for him ever since, making his life more difficult and talking badly about him to others, bossing him around and not giving him good tables. The past year or so l realized she's been weird towards me also. I felt like I was getting less tables, and not as good of tables. I looked at the reservation book on the iPad - she wasn't going in any kind of order. I emailed my manager telling her I think this lady is doing all this activity.... I said it's not a big deal tho and I don't expect any action to be taken or anything, but just wanted her to know. I didn't expect my manager to seem to not care at all. She is very spread thin tho, so I felt bad even emailing her about the issue. 
Fast forward to after this weekend I realized how this IS a big deal... the weird things happened during all 3 of my lunch shifts. it's costing me (and my bro) $$ and negatively impacting guest experience. I wanted to tackle this 1st thing in AM so woke up, got coffee and sat down to write out a quick email, and didn‚Äôt move for 7 hours‚Ä¶ I spent 7 HOURS writing an email (on my day off) only to not send it and feel it's ""too much"". 
Maybe I should just talk to my manager in person? I never know how to handle this stuff! I used chat gpt to help write my email. I suck at confrontation but I was so upset that I (regrettably) texted this hostess after work‚Ä¶. I should've just talked to her in person and not sounded accusatory in my text... She's extremely vindictive so I am a bit worried honestly!!

1imnq4o,https://i.redd.it/7hs5lrxi5fie1.jpeg,Did I just experienced a visual migraine aura?,"I‚Äôve never had a migraine pain headache before. 

It was a Saturday morning, and I woke up after nearly 11 hours of sleep‚ÄîI had forgotten to set my alarm. After getting up, I drank a glass of water, had some food, and took my supplements: garlic and omega-3. Then, I grabbed a coffee from a caf√© and drank about a cup of it fairly quickly.

Later, I went out to the store with a friend. About 30 minutes into our outing, I noticed something unusual: a small zigzag line appeared at the bottom of my left field of vision. It looked as if someone had flashed a bright light directly into my eye, and the shape lingered. I went back to my car, and the zigzag was still there, not fading away. Concerned, I mentioned to my friend that I was seeing strange lights in my vision.

Thinking I might just need to hydrate, I drove to the store. When I got out of the car, the visual disturbance seemed to worsen, now affecting the outer edge of my left vision. I started feeling confused and lightheaded, as if I might pass out or ""lose it."" I told my friend I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and asked if she could take me to urgent care.

During the 15-minute drive to the doctor, the visual issues gradually subsided, and I began to feel normal again. However, once at the clinic, I became incredibly thirsty, with a noticeably dry mouth. The doctors ran blood tests and checked my heart, but everything came back normal.

I‚Äôm still puzzled by what happened. Has anyone experienced something similar or have any thoughts on what this could have been?  I attached a pic of what I kinda saw. Small zig zag lines ",27,1739240018.0,migraine,21,0.97,False

So basically what happened is like me and my friend met outside the library and We went for a cup of coffee. 

The girl he was trying on went back to her ex so he had to meet me to tell me all about it. And when the conversation was over, I looked at the time and asked him, ""Brother, do you want to go watch Interstellar?"" (It's an movie which was released in cinemas) 

And the time that time was 7.03 and then we checked show timings and it was 7:05. We instantly called our home and asked ' can i go for a movie' they asked with whom then said yes And then we left for the movie and we reached pvr(cinema) at 7:12 and booked tickets and was on our seats before 7:20.
