1n8tsuz,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n8tsuz/are_women_being_too_idealistic/,Are women being too idealistic?,"I recently met an absolutely amazing woman, I don't think I've ever been attracted to anyone as much in my life both physically and personality wise. Met her at a singles event, got her number. We went on a coffee date, we got on great, conversation flowed well and there were no awkward silences or stuff like that.

After this she initially turned me down and said she didn't feel enough of a romantic connection, she is looking for something quite specific and maybe she is too brutal. What can you say to that? I pretty much just said I respect you know what you're looking for and I think you're incredible and you deserve the very best.

She seemed to be taken aback by this and surprised and we kept msging friendly and in a slightly flirty way. We then had 3 subsequent dates, a lunch, dinner at mine and dessert and chilling at her place. Honestly they all wet really great, we seemed to be on the same page, we got on great and the talking was really positive and we shared some kissing at mine and hers which also seemed good. Obviously I don't know everything but I'm confident of my ability to read a room and if someone is just not feeling it.

She told me on the subsequent dates how lovely it was and how kind I was...now she seemed like the world's most busiest woman (she was a lawyer) so I admit I did more of the chasing and maybe I did send too many msgs but I by no means love bombed her and went over the top. I was just naturally excited to be getting the opportunity to get to know this absolutely amazing person and was making my interest in her just clear. 

So after going to hers and surprising her with chocolate mousse I made and giving her flowers and then getting cosey and sharing some kissing I think this is really coming along nicely until 2 days later I get a msg from her while at work that she thinks I'm great and neither of us has done anything wrong but she just isn't quite feeling the romantic connection.

Obviously I was absolutely devestated and couldn't help but think is there something I did or said wrong but of course there really wasn't. I couldn't have been or treated her any better.

I openly admit that after this second rejection I let my emotions get the better of me and I sent her some msgs when I should've just left it. Nothing disrespectful or aggressive, just really searching for answers. I did own up and apologise to her for this for which she seemed to be quite understanding about.

We are not msging back and forth as we were for about 6 wks now, I only reached out to send her a brief happy birthday msg to which she said was very kind and I have left the ball in her court as to whether she ever wants to reach out to me but I can't see that happening.

I'm doing everything I should be doing, keeping busy, doing a crap load of exercise and continuing to push myself to go to as many singles events as I can and meet new people but in all honesty I do think about her a lot. I genuinely know that you can't make someone feel something for you but I really believe in not being dillusional when I say I think we had a connection and I think potentially we could've turned out to be an incredible match and obviously I'm incredibly disappointed on what could've been with this amazing person.

She deserves to be as happy as I would like to be and honestly I think she deserves the very best because she's incredible but I can't help thinking she may be a tad idealistic...I don't mean this in a negative or judgemental way but my gut tells me that she liked me but perhaps I didn't tick a couple of things off for her which I have driven myself crazy thinking about.

The only other thing I can think is that she wasn't used to someone being as nice as I was to her or that has somehow been perceived as me being too needy perhaps but all I was trying to do was be genuine with my intentions, communicate clearly and take a lead. I don't agree with acting withdrawn or playing games with people. 

I no it's probably wrong to think this but I hope one day we might cross paths again or she might reach out but I'm not an idiot and I know this is unlikely.

Does anyone have any advice at all for me?

1n8tsku,https://www.reddit.com/r/thelongdark/comments/1n8tsku/ideas_of_possible_mechanicschanges_in_blackfrost/,Ideas of possible mechanics/changes in Blackfrost,"As you all know, TLD2 is coming, and like many of you I’m very excited. While it’s still not out, I was thinking of possible ways BF might be different. It is a coop game, and while I think the devs don’t intend it being a PVP game, I still think there’s a lot of interesting gameplay ideas a Long Dark game with PVE can bring, along with different mechanics.

Sleep and Stamina:
The most obvious one would be sleep. I could imagine it would be very annoying to hop on a server with friends, play for like an hour, and then have to bunk down for 8 hours doing nothing while your character sleeps.

Therefore it may be in the interest of the gameplay if we removed sleep as the mechanic, and instead introduced a stamina system. Sprinting would decrease your stamina, and to replenish you need drink/eat to recover ~25% of the total, the rest is going to be recovered by eating/drinking special teas or something, aka coffee and actual tea. You stamina will recover to 100% if well fed and warm.

Beds/sleep mats would help to expedite it, imagine you and your friends holed up in a building or fire playing blackjack in game to rest up, eating and drinking to pass the time.

=====

Cooking:
Without the ability to pass time, perhaps cooking times will be decreased.

OR, perhaps it will be more involved, and you’d need a mini game where you need to stir the pot so it doesn’t burn (more calories this way) ie you’d need to actually put effort into cooking to make a higher quality/calorie end product.

Imagine you’re the camp cook, you have a job of cooking for your friends while they gather firewood or go do other things essential for the camp, like getting water, working on another dish, hunting, crafting.

=====

Time:
A coop game means the passage of time will become hard to make sense in a game like BF. Perhaps a mechanic wherein your friends will all need to hit confirm to pass time together? So one guy wants to sleep 8 in game hours, the others will need to also agree to that so time will pass.

Alternatively, you just wait out the cooking/crafting time IRL.

=====

Inventory/Weight Management:
With the addition of friends, it’d be OP if everyone can carry 60lbs of gear/loot. Perhaps in coop everyone needs a backpack to actually store thing. You would need to distribute the load between you and your friends. 

Instead of item capacity being governed by weight alone, perhaps a volume system is implemented. So for instance you have a backpack capable of storing 50 sq inches of stuff, but a can of soup is like 10 sq inches, so you’d only be able to take 5 cans, but with a friend he can take another 5 cans with him.

Clothing would have its own storage, like each pocket has around 8 sq inches of volume, so a backpack or satchel is required for holding things.

Firearms and tools need to be secured with holsters, slings, otherwise they need to be dropped etc. You can fit a hatchet in your pack, hold it in your hands, but a large two man saw either needs to be transported via a sling or fit into a special tool slot on your pack.

Rifles/shotguns for instance, require a sling to be slung, a handgun or revolver needs a holster to be equipped using your hotkeys.

Special backpacks would be needed for things like water or wood collections because they’re bulky items for making a camp.

=====

The wildlife:
To make things harder in a coop game, maybe introduce realistic hunting mechanics.

Animals can see/hear more realistically, so you’d need to implement real life hunting techniques such as camouflage and scent concealment.

Animals can be more skittish if they smell you from upwind, so care needs to be taken to approach your prey from downwind.

You party can set up ambushes on game trails, where someone flushed the animal down towards a friends with a bow or gun.

You can’t hit rabbits with a rock as easily, it’s just not accurate enough. You’d need to set up snares in an area where there’s a lot of hood prints or droppings. 

A shotgun would be useful for hitting birds like ptarmigans/crows, but care needs to be taken, you can use buckshot, but your ptarmigan would be inedible. 

Wildlife aggression will be amped up, a stag might charge you if not careful. Wolves might stalk you for miles, potentially attacking your camp if in the open. Someone would need to be on the lookout for timberwolves at night.

=====

Other players/role play:
In a PVE server, other players can serve as a potential for making friends or trading. Imagine running into another group, and trading a few cans of beans for a hacksaw.

Maybe with a coop server, tools and the like are scarcer than in single player, so someone might have a bow repair tool, gunsmith kits, reloading kits, forging materials like lead, steel, heavy hammers.

You may need to post up on bulletin boards flyers advertising your services for other players, like a farrier service for horses and the like.

We may even get an in game economy of trading for meat/fish from fishers, hunters, repairers. 

Someone might be a good cook, and will trade for ammo, someone who makes ammo can trade for vitamin C rich foods. Maybe someone with a bunch of cans and a drying rack can make meat jerky for trade, maybe for a new axe or arrows. Gunsmiths will repair weapons

In a PVP server, there may be raiders, you’ll have to defend your camp, but I’m less focused on PVP.

=====

Communication:
There will be no in game chat. Everything will be done by flyers, letters, and proximity voice chat.

If you die, you better have formed a plan to meet up at an area, because your friends will have a harder time finding you otherwise.

Perhaps people will start playing as a courier, delivering goods and letters, fighting the elements, bots (AI raiders/bandits), and the wildlife to connect people on one side of the map to the other side.

1n8tryc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n8tryc/i_want_to_go_back_to_my_country_but_dont_know/,I want to go back to my country but don’t know what to do anymore,"So for context I’m 16 year old mexican that my mom and step dad bring into US a year ago by greencard, from my city in mexico to LA is 5 hours including border and line, I got here by my mom telling me to “try highschool” for 2 weeks, when I tried I did not like the school at all, plus I was put in 9th grade and I was in 11th in mexico, it was a year ago, while in that time I was in a big depression for my school and my life, being september of 2024 I tried so much to come back to Mexico when I visited.

Few after, december 2 days before my birthday that wanted to be in mexico I was ran over by a car while coming home from highschool, nothing broken but a big contusion in my knee, being a athlete it was bad and I couldn’t walk properly but even so, I tried to go back, I was done with this but had to stay for doing police report and everything past, I went mexico for christmas but not the same like that, I told my dad that I wanted to stay and I paid everything, school, exams, uniform and the round trip to get my thing to LA but said no.
 
Few months passed and I was pretty tired of emocional abuse, blackmail from mom saying if I go she’d call police, remove my greencard and my now sue for the insurance, this keeps repeating everytime I wanted to talk to her about it, then in march I tried suicide but failed, I got into a psiquiatric hospital for 7 days, while in there I was sad, hopeless, 1 day she visit and she were telling me thing about of idiot I am so decided to go back inside in 15 minutes, even though visits were allowed for more than an hour, my heart sank in hopeless but then my dad told me that I will come back, so I lied to get discharged faster, but nothing, I did not went back and the same keep happening.

After finishing my 9th grade I went mexico with the intentions of staying because as my dad said, “stay there a year, then we’ll see”, nothing whole summer there, gym, volley ball and getting money to buy a car in mexico, I did everything and even found a job and a coffee from a family friend that was trainer and manager from few important restaurants, was my opportunity to get job experience, everything was going fine besides my mom, I had the money for a private school, money to pay my mom some money I borrowed and money to get a car. When things were going well she called when I was working, 4 times, 3 of them to insult me and the fourth to get me to come back to LA to accompany my sister because was her first time in US and highschool. 

I was thinking it because last time, they told me it was a 2 weeks try and lied, this time same thing “just 2 weeks, we go to vegas and you go”. I didn’t wanted to but my dad said “go” because he thing US is the best thing ever, american dream and all that, so I came, got into school, planned my round way trip and everything, after vegas I said “I’m going now, I did what I had” everytime being respectful, but same thing. They told me to stay, I was better here, just try this year, now I’m in 10 grade 
rotating 4 outfits, I don’t even know what to do anymore.

I know my dad can have me there but my mom manipulates him so bad, I’m just in automatic, having thoughts, this is my first time writting in reddit and I don’t know if its too much or need more details that I have.",1,1757040237.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1n8trme,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkReform/comments/1n8trme/after_almost_a_year_of_silence_i_finally_feel/,"After almost a year of silence, I finally feel brave enough to share my story. For confidentiality, I’ll just call them a “global music tech conglomerate.” This company tried to destroy my reputation, my health, and my music career just before I had the chance to bloom as an electronic artist.","*Pay + Exploitation*

I worked in the testing department across all their IPs, hopping from brand to brand at short notice. I’d even moved countries for the position.

The salary was meagre. I signed the contract anyway because, like a lot of young professionals, I wanted to “make it” in the industry. But the highly specialised skillset they demanded was worth far more than what we earned.

Most new staff literally starved the week before payday. One October, I had to live on “survivalist food” just to get by. When the living wage increased, they were forced to give everyone fake “promotions” just to stay legal.


*Sexism + Double Standards*

There were only four women in the entire office. My female superiors were pushed into admin tasks that men didn’t have to do, and they often faced lewd comments behind closed doors.

One colleague made a sexual remark about me. Everyone laughed at my expense. Totally normal in male-dominated tech spaces. Unsurprising.

Rules were also different for me. The men would take hour-long paid coffee breaks at 3pm with no issues. If I split my 30-min lunch into two 15-min breaks? I got penalised.


*Medical Discrimination*

I have a health condition and take medication. I was upfront about this from day one.

Still, I was treated differently. When everyone else earned the right to WFH, I was denied. They said they didn’t “trust” me because I was on medication. I should have left then, but I stayed because I loved the field.

Later, HR demanded I disclose every detail of my condition, including exact names of meds - or risk being fired. Pretty sure that’s illegal. I even paid for a doctor’s note.


*Music + Jealousy*

Outside of work, I wrote, produced, and performed electronic music. Lots of us had side gigs, and it was allowed contractually.

My music started to gain traction. My flatmates once heard me mixing and called me “the next Radiohead.” I was happy about my fresh, unique sound.

Then word spread at work. The new head of department, a man in his 40s, seemed weirdly threatened by me. I think he resented that I was a woman making my own music while also excelling technically. Insecure men often lash out when women “upstage” them.


*Retaliation + Firing*

That same week, he bad-mouthed me to my manager behind my back.

I got disciplined for learning a language *during my lunch break*. Then, the day after my first (unpaid) live gig, I was let go on the spot. No severance. No notice. They even mentioned my live gig *before* firing me.

My manager even wrote in the company chat about my strangely sudden departure from the company.

“DO NOT RESPOND. DO NOT REACT.”

Instant isolation. My friends and colleagues were terrified to talk to me for fear of losing their jobs.


*Collapse*

The stress wrecked my health. I unintentionally started starving. I was so traumatised and embarrassed I avoided public places in case I bumped into ex-colleagues. I was terrified of retaliation from the man who slandered me.

Somehow, I still landed a much higher paying role while literally going weeks without food. My sodium levels dropped so low I ended up in the ER. But sadly the hospital staff also neglected me too.

Eventually, I lost all hope. I sadly attempted to end my life. The pain was too much. My father found me just in time. I was 29.


*Aftermath*

It’s been a year of fighting my way back. I’ve lost critical opportunities, future earnings, and confidence. I spent 14+ years of my life dedicated to music, only to be cut down violently just at the very moment before I could bloom.


*Why Am I Sharing This?*

I don’t want pity. I just want people to know how exploitative, sexist, and discriminatory certain companies within the industry can be and how quickly they can destroy you out of spite or jealousy. Especially if you don't fit the mold. Watch yourself out there.

If you’re going through something similar please, protect your health first. No job no ""dream"" is worth losing that. Professional sabotage is much more common than we want to think.",1,1757040207.0,WorkReform,0,1.0,False

1n8tpc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1n8tpc2/she_put_up_photos_of_everyone_but_me_the_mom/,She put up photos of everyone but me (the mom),"I’ve been having issues with my MIL for a while now but I wasn’t sure if I was being too sensitive up until this point. I’ll start by saying that I always thought we had an okay relationship. She is a bit of a control freak, but we got along well enough, and I liked her. Before I had my son, we never had any issues, but it’s like as soon as he was born, a switch flipped and she went insane or something. A few examples: 

 - She asked if she could be in the delivery room, but I politely told her I’d prefer it was just my husband and I. Fast forward to the day of delivery (I ended up having a scheduled c-section), and who shows up within minutes of us to the hospital room but MIL… in her defense, maybe she thought since things had changed, it would be okay. But she was there when we got back from surgery so we never got that moment together alone with our baby. At the time I wrote it off as her just being excited, but now I feel like it was a huge crossing of boundaries. 

 - She loves to take him without asking whenever she feels like it. If we’re visiting and one of us is holding him, she feels entitled to just come and take him from our arms. Or there have been times where we finally get to her house, (which is a two and a half hour drive so we need to change him) she will hover in the doorway of the room and as soon as he’s changed, she swoops in and takes him away, again without asking. One time we were all together with family, a relative was holding him, and my husband said okay I’ll take him now and she said “okay let me help”, but instead of passing him over, she just keeps him on her lap. 

 - Once she finally gets her clutches on him, she loves to take him to another room, or go outside so she is alone with him. I don’t know why she has to be alone with him.

 - She is a huge baby hog and loves to hold him for long periods of time. I remember during the first week of my son’s life, she asked to hold him and she went into another room and was reading while he slept on her lap. That alone doesn’t bother me, but she kept him there for about two hours, and I was getting so anxious because it made me really uncomfortable. But then there are other times where she’ll seem like she really wants to hold him, and then passes him off to someone else (Almost weirdly feels like she takes him just to play mom and be the one who gets to offer him to people). 

 - If I try and gently assert myself and say I’m going to take him and get him to sleep, she’ll say “oh he doesn’t seem tired”. Or I say that it’s time to feed him and she says “when is the last time he ate?” Seems weird especially considering I’m his mom and I spend all day with him so I know his schedule. 

 - She buys him all kinds of things, which alone isn’t mean, but she’s bought some of his first holiday outfits, which is upsetting because that to me seems like a privilege the parent should have. One time she came over and I showed her the Fourth of July shirt I got for him, and a few days later she texts us a picture of a different Fourth of July outfit that she bought. 

 I could sit and ramble all day about the things she does that upset me, but the thing that really topped it all off happened this weekend. We went over to visit because other family was going to be there as well. If you know her, you’d know that pictures are her thing. Her hallway walls are covered with family photos, her decorative tables, coffee table, mantle, dining room walls, and even bedroom walls have photos all over them. Well this weekend I noticed that she had put out 20 new photos of my son, which I thought was a little excessive considering he’s only 5 months old, but I appreciated the enthusiasm. However, I noticed something odd. She put up photos with my husband holding our son, with her, and even her mom holding him as well, but not one of me. Not one single picture including me, his own mother. That really hurt my feelings. I ended up calling her out on it. I made sure to be nice about it, but I told her how it made me feel. My husband feels the same way I do about her and the situation, and I know generally since it’s his mom, the husband should be the one to call her out, but there was a rage in me from all of this building up, and also I knew it was possible she’d be more dismissive of him, so I did it. I wanted to because she wouldn’t be able to brush me off. She claimed that it was because she didn’t have any photos of us together she thought I would want up. We have been together for 13 years so she has photos. I know she had photos that she took in the hospital of us, and she could have just as easily asked us to send her some if she felt I should be included in her shrine to my son. Anyways, after she said that, I also called her out for boundary crossing and told her I don’t appreciate her undermining me and picking him up without asking, but all she said was that she understood. A very short worded response compared to the one she sent after I called her out about the photos. 

I guess after everything, I’m happy I called her out and the only way we’ll know if she takes me seriously is on the next visit, but I just had to get that off my chest. I just don’t understand her, I’ve literally not had this problem with anyone else! ",5,1757040021.0,JUSTNOMIL,2,1.0,False

My girlfriend '18F' and I had been together for almost a year, officially in a relationship for six months. We started dating when she was 18 and I was 23.
From the beginning, I was open with her about the possibility of going long distance after I graduated. She always said she was okay with it, and we tried to build something real despite knowing that deadline was coming.
But we had our share of issues. We’d fight about things like her drinking, wearing revealing clothes, and even her grabbing coffee one-on-one with her gay guy friends. I fully admit I felt insecure, not proud of it, and I let those insecurities show in unhealthy ways.
She eventually broke up with me, saying I was immature and needed to work on myself. I called her right away, apologized, and we got back together. But two days later, she ended things again for the same reasons. I kept trying. I sent heartfelt messages. She took me back again.
We started talking seriously about long-distance. She wanted to know a clear timeline, when I’d come back to the U.S. I told her I didn’t have a definite plan yet. She didn’t want to move to Dubai or even meet halfway. She expected me to do all the compromising.
Eventually, she broke up with me again, this time for good. She told me never to contact her again and that if I did, she’d block me. I panicked. I texted her right after to tell her I’d stay for her, I’d delay going back to Dubai, but she blocked me. In that moment of panic and heartbreak, I called her older sister '30F' , who I’d spoken to before. I broke down crying while explaining everything to her.
A few days later, I texted my ex again asking her to reconsider, but she didn’t reply.
Now I’m five days from leaving the country, and it’s tearing me apart that I won’t get to say goodbye. I understand she set a boundary, but I’m struggling with the fact that a person I loved this deeply could cut me off completely. I don’t want to push her further away, but I feel like I’m leaving with this huge emotional knot in my chest.

Should try to say goodbye one last time or just walk away in silence?

1n8tfpi,https://youtu.be/3MSWxUUVWDw,4 Very Scary TRUE Off-Grid Supply Run Horror Stories,"# ""Mail Day Massacre"":

I woke up that morning knowing mail day was coming. Living out here in this remote spot in Alaska, cut off from everything, the weekly plane drop was our lifeline for food, parts, and letters. My cabin sat a few miles from the main cluster of houses in McCarthy, and I figured I'd head over early to help unload. My neighbor Louis had stopped by the night before for a game of cards, but he left late. I didn't think much of it.

I finished my coffee and stepped outside to start my snowmobile. The engine roared to life, and I rode toward town. As I got closer, something felt wrong. No smoke rose from the chimneys like usual. Normally, folks would be stirring, getting ready for the plane. But everything looked still. I slowed down near the first house, the Heglands'. Their door hung open a bit. I called out, ""Les? Flo? You up?""

No answer. I pushed the door wider and walked in. The place smelled of fresh coffee, but then I saw the blood. It splattered the floor and walls. Les lay face down near the table, a hole in his back. Flo slumped in the corner, her eyes open but empty. My hands shook as I backed out. What had happened? A fight? An accident? I ran to the next house, Maxine's. Her door was shut, but when I knocked, it creaked open. Inside, she was on the floor, shot too. Blood pooled around her head.

Panic rose in me. I grabbed my rifle from the snowmobile and moved to the Nashes' place. Tim and Amy were good people, young couple. Their door was ajar. I peeked in and saw them both down, bodies twisted, blood everywhere. Nearby, Harley King's cabin showed the same horror—him crumpled by his stove, shot multiple times.

Who did this? My mind raced. I thought of Louis. He lived close to me, but he hadn't shown up for mail day. Was he okay? Or was he part of this? I hopped back on the snowmobile and sped to his place. His door was closed. I banged on it. ""Louis! It's Chris! Open up!""

The door swung open, and there he stood, holding a gun. His eyes looked wild, not like the quiet guy I knew. ""Chris,"" he said, his voice flat. ""Come in.""

I stepped inside, rifle in hand, but he moved fast, pointing his pistol at me. ""Drop it,"" he ordered.

""What's going on, Louis? I saw the bodies. Did you... why?""

He smiled a little, like it was nothing. ""They had to go. All of them. The pipeline, the outsiders—they're coming to ruin everything. I had to clear the way.""

""What are you talking about? These are our neighbors!""

He shook his head. ""No time for talk. You're next.""

I lunged at him, but he fired. The bullet grazed my arm, burning hot. I dropped my rifle and grabbed for a knife on his table. He came at me, grabbing my throat. ""Look, you're already dead,"" he whispered close to my face. ""If you'll just quit fighting, I'll make it easy for you.""

His words hit like ice. I slashed the knife across his face, drawing blood. He yelled and loosened his grip. I shoved him back and ran out the door, feet sinking into the snow. I had no boots on, just socks, but I didn't care. The cold bit hard, but fear pushed me. I heard him behind me, cursing, firing shots that whizzed past.

I stumbled through the trees, heart racing, breath coming in gasps. My feet went numb fast, but I kept going. ""Help!"" I shouted, but who would hear? The town was dead. Then I heard an engine—a snowmobile. It was Donna, one of the few left. She saw me waving and pulled up.

""Chris! What happened? You're bleeding!""

""Louis... he killed everyone. Get me to the airstrip. The plane's coming.""

She nodded, face pale, and I climbed on. We raced to the strip just as the mail plane touched down. The pilot, Jim, stepped out, looking confused. ""Where is everybody?""

""Louis went crazy,"" I gasped. ""Shot up the town. Killed six, maybe more.""

Jim's eyes widened. ""Get in. We'll fly to Glennallen, tell the troopers.""

As we lifted off, I looked down. Smoke rose from one cabin—Louis must have set a fire. Donna sat quiet, shaking. ""He almost got me too,"" I said.

Jim radioed ahead. ""Emergency. Mass shooting in McCarthy. Suspect armed.""

Hours later, troopers flew in. They found Louis twenty miles out, on his snowmobile, trying to escape. He didn't fight when they cuffed him. Charged with six counts of murder. Turns out he was paranoid about some pipeline plot, thought killing us all would stop it.

I got my arm fixed, feet thawed. But sleep doesn't come easy now. Every creak in the cabin makes me jump. Living off-grid was supposed to be peaceful. Now it's a nightmare I can't escape.





# ""Raised in Silence"":

I grew up in a world far from roads and people, where my family built our home deep in the Alaskan wilderness. My father led us there, promising a pure life away from the corrupt outside. We were fifteen kids, all taught to obey without question. Our cabin sat miles from the nearest town, McCarthy, a tiny spot with just a handful of folks who eyed us strangely when we showed up. Supplies didn't last forever, though. Every few months, Father would pick one of us to go with him on the long ride to town for flour, tools, and whatever else we needed to survive another stretch of isolation.

This time, he chose me. I was the oldest daughter, nineteen then, and I knew the routine. We saddled the horses early one morning, the trail ahead twisting through thick trees and over rocky streams. Father rode in front, his rifle slung across his back, humming old hymns under his breath. I followed on my mare, the packs empty for now, my hands tight on the reins. He didn't talk much at first, but I felt his eyes on me whenever he glanced back.

""You remember what I taught you, girl?"" he said after a while, his voice low and steady, like he was testing me.

""Yes, Father,"" I replied, keeping my tone even. ""The world out there is full of evil. We stick to our path.""

He nodded, satisfied for the moment. ""Good. Because if you stray, the Lord sees it. And so do I.""

The words hung between us as we pushed on. The ride took hours, the forest closing in tight. I thought about the bruises hidden under my sleeves, the nights when he'd come into the room I shared with my sisters, whispering that it was God's will. My brothers and sisters back at the cabin didn't know the full extent, or if they suspected, they stayed silent. Fear kept us all in line. But lately, doubts had crept in, small at first, like cracks in ice.

By midday, we reached the edge of McCarthy. It wasn't much—a dirt road, a few old buildings, a store where outsiders traded goods. Father tied the horses outside the general store and went in first, leaving me to wait. ""Stay put,"" he ordered. ""Don't talk to anyone.""

I stood there, watching people go by. A man in a truck nodded at me, but I looked away quick. Inside, I heard Father bartering with the store owner, his voice rising in that charming way he had when he wanted something. Minutes dragged on. My mind raced. What if I walked away right now? The thought made my pulse quicken. But where? He always watched so close.

He came out with sacks of grain and nails, loading them onto the horses. ""Help me,"" he said, and I did, our hands brushing as we tied the knots. His grip lingered on my arm a second too long, a reminder. We mounted up again, but he decided we needed fuel for the generator too. ""One more stop,"" he muttered, leading us to the fuel depot down the road.

At the depot, an older couple ran the place. The woman, Mrs. Thompson, smiled at me as Father haggled over prices. ""You look tired, dear,"" she said softly while he was busy with her husband. ""Everything all right at home?""

I froze, my mouth dry. Father was just feet away, but his back was turned. ""I'm fine,"" I whispered, but my voice shook.

She frowned, glancing at him. ""If you need anything, you can tell me.""

Father turned then, his eyes narrowing. ""What are you two chatting about?""

""Nothing, sir,"" Mrs. Thompson said quickly. ""Just asking about the trail conditions.""

He stared at her, then at me. ""Let's go, girl. We don't need idle talk.""

We rode out of town, the supplies heavy on the horses. The forest swallowed us again, but something had shifted. Father's mood darkened. He didn't hum anymore. Instead, he started questioning me. ""What did that woman really say to you?""

""Just about the trail, Father,"" I lied, my voice barely above a whisper.

He stopped his horse abruptly, forcing me to halt. ""Don't lie to me. I can see it in your eyes. You're thinking of betraying us, aren't you?""

My breath caught. How did he know? He always seemed to know. ""No, Father. I would never.""

He leaned closer, his face inches from mine. ""Remember what happened last time one of you thought about running? Your brother still bears the scars. The Lord punishes the wicked, and I am His instrument.""

I nodded, terror twisting inside me. We continued, but the trail felt endless now. Every rustle in the bushes made me jump, imagining him turning on me right there. Hours passed, and as the light faded, we neared a stream where we sometimes camped if the ride ran long. Father decided we'd stop for the night. ""Too risky in the dark,"" he said.

We set up a small fire, ate cold biscuits from the supplies. He watched me the whole time, not blinking much. ""Tell me the truth now,"" he said after we ate. ""What did she say?""

""Nothing, I swear."" My hands trembled as I fed the horses.

He stood up slowly, his shadow stretching across the ground. ""You're hiding something. Come here.""

I backed away a step. ""Please, Father. I didn't do anything.""

His hand shot out, grabbing my wrist hard. ""You think you can fool me? After all I've done for this family?""

Pain shot up my arm, but worse was the look in his eyes—cold, unyielding. I yanked free, stumbling back. ""Stop! You're hurting me!""

He advanced, voice rising. ""You ungrateful child. I'll teach you obedience.""

In that moment, panic took over. I turned and ran, crashing through the underbrush, branches whipping my face. Behind me, I heard him shout my name, his boots pounding the ground. The forest was a maze, dark shapes everywhere. I tripped over roots, fell hard, but got up, lungs burning. His voice echoed, closer now. ""Come back! You can't survive out here alone!""

I kept going, heart slamming in my chest. Minutes felt like forever. I burst out onto a faint trail, one I remembered led back toward McCarthy. But he was gaining—I could hear his horse now, he'd mounted up. Hooves thundered behind me.

Up ahead, lights flickered. A cabin? No, a ranger station, one of those outposts near the park boundary. I pounded on the door, screaming. ""Help! Please, open up!""

A man inside yanked it open, rifle in hand. ""What's going on?""

""My father—he's coming! He's dangerous!""

The ranger pulled me inside, bolting the door. Through the window, I saw Father approach on horseback, his face twisted in rage. ""Give her back! She's my daughter!""

The ranger radioed for help, keeping his gun ready. ""Stay away, sir. Authorities are on the way.""

Father circled the station, yelling threats. ""You'll regret this! The Lord will judge you all!""

I huddled in the corner, telling the ranger everything—the beatings, the worse things he did in the night, how he controlled us all. Words poured out, things I'd never said aloud. The ranger listened, his face hardening.

Help arrived after what seemed like ages—state troopers on ATVs, lights flashing. They confronted Father, but he didn't fight. Not then. He glared at me through the window as they cuffed him. ""This isn't over,"" he mouthed.

They took him away, and me to safety. Later, my brothers and sisters were rescued from the cabin. The truth came out in court—his past crimes, the abuse spanning years. He went to prison, died there alone.

But even now, years later, when I'm far from that place, I wake up sometimes, thinking I hear his voice in the wind. The wilderness hides secrets, and some scars never fully heal.





# ""The Roadblock"":

I decided to head into town earlier than usual that morning. My cabin sits deep in the Montana backcountry, miles from any paved road, and I only make the trip once a month for groceries, fuel, and whatever else keeps me going through the isolation. The drive takes two hours each way on dirt tracks that wind through thick pines and empty valleys. No cell service for most of it, just me and the truck. I loaded up on canned goods, batteries, and a new propane tank at the general store, chatted a bit with the clerk about the early frost coming in, and started back before noon. The road felt quieter than normal, with no other vehicles in sight.

About halfway home, I rounded a bend and saw a fallen tree across the path. It was a big one, fresh enough that the bark still looked damp where it had snapped. I stopped the truck, engine idling, and stepped out to check if I could drag it aside with the winch on my bumper. That's when I noticed the tire tracks veering off into the brush nearby, like someone had pulled over recently. I figured maybe a logger or hunter had an accident, so I called out, ""Hello? Anyone need a hand?"" No answer at first, just the wind rustling the leaves.

Then, from behind a cluster of trees, a man stepped out. He was tall, maybe six-foot-four, with matted hair and clothes that looked like he'd been wearing them for weeks—faded jeans caked in mud, a flannel shirt torn at the sleeves. His eyes were sharp, fixed on me right away. ""You got a chainsaw in that truck?"" he asked, his voice rough but steady, like he was used to giving orders.

I nodded slowly, keeping my distance. ""Yeah, back in the bed. You the one who put this tree here?""

He smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Nah, storm did that last night. But good timing you showing up. I could use some help clearing it. My rig's stuck back there."" He pointed vaguely into the woods, where I could just make out the outline of an old camper trailer half-hidden in the shadows. It looked rundown, with tarps draped over parts of it, like someone was living rough out here.

I felt uneasy, but out here, folks help each other. I grabbed the chainsaw from the truck and walked over, starting it up with a pull. As I cut into the trunk, he stood too close, watching every move. ""You live around here?"" he said over the noise.

""Up the road a ways,"" I replied, focusing on the blade. ""Off-grid place. Just grabbing supplies today.""

He nodded, stepping even closer. ""Off-grid, huh? Smart man. Away from all the noise. We got a setup like that too. Me and a couple friends. You should come see it. We're always looking for extra hands with chores.""

The way he said ""we"" made me pause. I glanced back at the trailer and saw movement—a curtain twitch, then a face peering out for a split second before vanishing. ""No thanks,"" I said, shutting off the saw. ""I need to get home before dark. This should be clear enough now.""

But as I turned to head back, he grabbed my arm, not hard at first, but firm. ""Hold on. You can't just leave. We need that chainsaw. And maybe some of those supplies you picked up. Share and share alike, right?""

I pulled away, my grip tightening on the tool. ""Let go. I'm not giving you anything.""

His face hardened, and he reached into his pocket, pulling out a hunting knife with a long blade that glinted in the light. ""Don't make this difficult. Hand over the keys too. We'll take the truck off your hands. No one around to hear you yell.""

My mind raced. The road was blocked behind me, but I could reverse if I moved fast. I swung the chainsaw handle at his wrist, connecting just enough to make him drop the knife and curse in pain. He lunged, but I dodged and ran for the truck, jumping in and slamming the door. The engine roared as I threw it in reverse, tires spinning on the dirt. Through the windshield, I saw him pick up the knife and start after me, shouting, ""You won't get far! We know these woods!""

I backed up fast, weaving around ruts, until I hit a narrow side trail I'd used once for hunting. It was rough, branches scraping the sides, but it looped around the blockage. In the rearview, I spotted him running back toward the trailer, and then another figure emerged—shorter, with a rifle slung over his shoulder. They—no, he and that other man—started toward a beat-up jeep parked nearby, its engine firing up with a growl.

The chase lasted maybe ten minutes, but it felt endless. My truck bounced over roots and rocks, the side trail barely wide enough. Their jeep was gaining, headlights flashing in my mirrors as they honked wildly. ""Pull over!"" I heard one yell faintly through the open windows. ""We just want to talk!""

I pushed the pedal harder, sweat dripping down my face, until the trail spit me out onto the main road beyond the fallen tree. I floored it toward home, glancing back every few seconds. The jeep followed for a mile or so, then suddenly veered off into the trees, disappearing. Maybe they didn't want to risk getting closer to where rangers patrol.

I made it to my cabin, locked every door and window, and spent the night with my shotgun across my lap, listening for any sound outside. In the morning, I drove back to town and reported it to the sheriff. He said they'd had reports of squatters in that area—guys running from warrants, setting up camps in the backwoods, preying on anyone who passed by. They sent a deputy to check, but the trailer was gone, just tire marks and a cold fire pit left behind.

That was six months ago. I still make my supply runs, but now I take a longer route, and I always carry extra fuel in case I need to turn around quick. Sometimes, when the wind picks up at night, I wonder if those men are still out there, waiting for the next lone driver to come along. Living off-grid means freedom, but it also means you're on your own when trouble finds you.





# ""Trust Me, He Said"":

I had been staying in my little cabin up in the mountains for close to a year. The place was basic, no power lines or neighbors for miles, just me and the trees. I liked it that way, away from all the noise. But supplies don't last forever. Food, fuel for the generator, some tools—I made the drive down to the small town every few weeks. The road was narrow, full of twists, and if something went wrong, help was hard to find.

That morning, I loaded up my empty cans and bags into the old truck and started the engine. It coughed a bit, like always, but soon hummed along. The drive took about two hours each way, and I planned to grab what I needed and get back before dark. I passed the usual spots: the old bridge, the pull-off where hunters sometimes parked. Everything felt normal until about an hour in, when the truck shuddered. Smoke came from under the hood, and the whole thing died right there on a straight stretch.

I got out and popped the hood. Steam everywhere, and I could smell something burning. No idea what broke—I’m no mechanic. My phone had no signal, as expected in these parts. I waited, hoping another vehicle would come by. Minutes turned into half an hour. Finally, I heard an engine approaching from behind. A beat-up sedan pulled up, and the driver rolled down his window. He was a middle-aged guy, balding, with a friendly smile at first.

""You okay?"" he asked, leaning out.

""Yeah, truck just quit on me. Think it's the radiator or something.""

He nodded. ""Happens out here. Want me to take a look?""

I stepped back as he got out. He poked around under the hood for a minute, then shook his head. ""Looks bad. You need a tow, probably. Town's not far—I can give you a lift if you want. Name's Tom.""

I hesitated, but what choice did I have? Walking would take hours, and no one else was coming. ""Appreciate it. I'm Alex.""

We got in his car, and he started driving toward town. At first, it was fine. He asked about my cabin, how long I'd been living off-grid. I kept answers short—didn't want to share too much. But then he started talking about his own life, how he used to work in the city but moved out here for ""peace."" His voice had this edge, like he was forcing the words.

After a bit, he took a turn off the main road. ""Shortcut,"" he said when I looked over. ""Saves time.""

The new road was even narrower, gravel crunching under the tires. Trees closed in tight. ""You sure this leads to town?"" I asked.

""Oh yeah,"" he replied, grinning. ""Trust me. Hey, you got family out here?""

""No, just me.""

He nodded slowly. ""Good. Being alone is best sometimes.""

That made my skin prickle. We drove in silence for a while, but the road didn't seem right. No signs, no familiar landmarks. I checked my phone again—no bars. ""Maybe we should turn back,"" I suggested.

""Nah, we're almost there."" But he slowed down and pulled over at a clearing with an old, rundown shed. ""Car's acting up. Overheating, I think. Mind grabbing the water jug from the trunk? It's right in there.""

I paused. Something felt off. Why stop now? ""You got a jug?""

""Yeah, blue one. Pop the trunk.""

I got out, heart beating faster. The trunk latch clicked open. I lifted it, and inside, mixed with tools and rags, I saw ropes. Thick ones, coiled neat. And a roll of duct tape. My mouth went dry. Why would he need that?

From the car, he called, ""Find it?""

""Uh, yeah."" I grabbed the jug, but my mind raced. No way was I getting back in. The shed was close—maybe I could run.

He stepped out then, walking toward me. ""Let me help."" His eyes looked different now, sharper.

I backed up. ""Actually, I think I'll walk from here. Thanks for the ride.""

His smile faded. ""Come on, Alex. Don't be like that. We're friends now.""

""No, really. I got it.""

He took another step. ""You sure? It's dangerous out here alone.""

That's when I bolted. Dropped the jug and ran into the trees, branches whipping my face. Behind me, I heard him shout, ""Hey! Get back here!""

I didn't stop. Crashed through underbrush, heart pounding in my ears. He followed at first—I could hear footsteps crunching leaves—but I was faster, knew how to move in the woods from all my time out here. I zigzagged, found a stream, waded through to hide my trail. After what felt like forever, the sounds stopped. I hid behind a fallen log, breathing quiet, listening.

Nothing. No more footsteps. I waited there, shaking, until the light started fading. Then I crept out, found my way back to the main road. It took hours, feet sore, but I flagged down a passing logger's truck. The driver, an older guy named Bill, gave me a ride to town. ""You look rough,"" he said. ""What happened?""

I told him about the breakdown, the ride, the weird stop. His face went serious. ""Bald guy? Sedan?""

""Yeah. Why?""

Bill shook his head. ""Sounds like that fella who's been around. Cops been looking for him. Folks say he picks up hitchers, but some don't make it back.""

My blood ran cold. In town, I went straight to the sheriff's office. Gave them the details—Tom, the car, the ropes. They took notes, said they'd check it out. My truck got towed in later, fixed for a busted hose.

Days passed, and I stayed in my cabin, doors locked tight, even though I never did before. Then, a week later, the sheriff called. ""We found him,"" he said. ""Arrested on an old warrant. Assault, kidnapping attempt from years back. You got lucky.""

I hung up, staring out the window at the dark trees. Every time I make that supply run now, I check the engine twice. And I never accept rides. The mountains are peaceful, but people—they can turn everything wrong in a blink.",1,1757039250.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1n8tfbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChronicPain/comments/1n8tfbn/quick_access_guides_for_interrupting_pain_and/,Quick access guides for interrupting pain and negative thought spirals.,"In working with ChatGPT on PTSD counseling, we've put together 4 quick access cards that I use to break cycles. I thought I would share them in hopes that someone else finds them helpful. I keep a screenshot of each on my phone so I can find them quickly. Now, these are written for me and my abilities. If you use one or more of these guides, do alter them as appropriate for you. For example, I can stand up and stretch, Zonco and Foxy are our pet dogs, I like to do Jigsaw puzzles on my Tablet, the phrase ""You’re not mine to carry any more.” is one tool that I use to help stop thought loops.

=======================================================

# 🟦 Behavioral Activation Pocket-Card

Goal: Break the cycle of “pain → inactivity → worse mood → more pain.”

1. Notice the stall: “I’m stuck. Pain is running the show.”
2. Choose *one* small action:
   * Stand up and stretch.
   * Step outside for 2 minutes.
   * Pet Foxy or Zonco.
   * Tidy one object (remote, glass, blanket).
3. Do it *now*, not later. Momentum matters more than size.
4. Name the win: “That’s one point for me, zero for pain.”
5. Optional repeat: Stack another tiny action if energy allows.

*(Trick: don’t wait to “feel like it.” The action itself is the treatment.)*

=======================================================

# 🟨 Contextual Reframing Pocket-Card

Goal: Change the scenery so pain has less mental real estate.

1. Shift the setting: Move from bed to porch, chair to kitchen, indoors to outdoors.
2. Alter the inputs:
   * Sound: music, TV, podcast, birds outside.
   * Light: open blinds, step into sun/shade, change lamp.
   * Smell: coffee, candle, fresh air.
3. Pair it with meaning: “Same pain, new surroundings. It doesn’t own me everywhere.”
4. Anchor the moment: Notice one detail (color of the sky, rhythm of a song) and give it a label.
5. Check in: Did the pain shrink in “loudness”? Even a 5% shift counts.

=======================================================

# 🟥 Rapid Distraction Card

Goal: Short-circuit thought loops or pain spirals fast by overloading attention.

1. Shock the senses:
   * Hold ice to your face or hand.
   * Grip something soft until your hand trembles.
   * Bite into something sour or spicy.
2. Scramble the brain’s track:
   * Count backward from 100 by sevens.
   * Recite the alphabet in reverse.
   * Name every state capital, Pokémon, or car brand you can.
3. Flood the inputs:
   * Watch fast-cut YouTube/TV clips.
   * Listen to music with sudden changes (tempo shifts, mashups).
   * Jigsaw Puzzle app, timed mode if available.
4. Label the win: “Loop interrupted. Brain rebooted.”

=======================================================

# 🟩 Grounding Pocket Card

Goal: Anchor yourself in the present when thought loops or anxiety try to drag you under.

1. Physiological Sigh ×3
   * Two short inhales through the nose
   * One long exhale through the mouth
   * Repeat three times
2. 5–4–3–2–1 Check-In
   * 5 things you can see
   * 4 things you can feel/touch
   * 3 things you can hear
   * 2 things you can smell
   * 1 thing you can taste
3. Touchstone Phrase
   * “You’re not mine to carry any more.” *(preferred)*
4. Anchor Object
   * Weighted blanket, stone, coin—something solid to hold
5. Re-Orient
   * Name the date, time, and where you are right now

I could use some help narrowing this down.

My needs:
	•	Size: 15” or 16”
	•	Memory/Storage: 32GB RAM and at least 1TB SSD
	•	Display: OLED or 4K (I’d like this to last 4–5 years)
	•	Workload: I’m a recruiter — regularly open huge Excel spreadsheets + about 30 browser tabs at any given time. Lots of multitasking.
	•	Thermals: My old Dell ran cool and didn’t get hot (only lasted ~2 years though). I had a Mac and was disappointed, so I’m leaning Windows, but I’m open if there’s a compelling case.

Nice-to-haves (not dealbreakers):
	•	Good keyboard/trackpad for long typing sessions
	•	Stays cool and quiet under load
	•	Solid battery life for meetings and coffee-shop work
	•	Plenty of ports (USB-A, USB-C/Thunderbolt, HDMI)
	•	1080p webcam would be great for interviews

Questions for you all:
	1.	Any reliable models in the 15–16” class with 32GB/1TB and an OLED or 4K panel that won’t throttle to death?
	2.	For my use (big Excel + many tabs, no gaming/video editing), should I prioritize Intel Core Ultra / Ryzen 7, or does it not matter much if thermals are good?
	3.	Any brands/models with a known reputation for longevity (4–5 years) and cool/quiet operation?
	4.	If you own one you love, what’s your real-world battery life while multitasking?
	5.	I’m flexible on budget if it’s worth it, but if you have tiers (e.g., best sub-$1.2k, $1.5k, $2k+), I’d appreciate that.",1,1757039132.0,laptops,0,0.99,False
1n8tc8b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherWalken/comments/1n8tc8b/christopher_walken_playboy_interview_1997_part_2/,Christopher Walken Playboy Interview 1997 Part 2,"**Playboy**: Elvis is someone you've been fascinated, almost obsessed, with since you were a teenager. When was the first time you laid eyes on him?

**Walken**: I was about 15. I asked this girl to go to the prom and she said she would but that she had a boyfriend, an older guy. Then she took out her wallet and showed me a picture of this handsome guy with the hair, the teeth, who looked like a Greek statue. I thought, All right, and then I asked to see it again and said, ""This is not a photograph. You cut this out of a magazine."" She got farmisht and said, ""Yes, you're right, I did. I'm so madly in love with him. His name is Elvis Presley."" She went with me to the prom. I had her in a compromising position. That's what you get for lying.

**Playboy**: How did Elvis' look affect you?

**Walken**: I saw all his movies. I still comb my hair like his to some extent.

**Playboy**: You played archetypal bad guys in ""A View to a Kill"" and ""Batman Returns."" Are they more like cartoon villains? Way over the top?

**Walken**: Yeah, sure. Those were costume movies. In the Bond film I had my hair dyed an impossible yellow color, and that became my motivation in a lot of scenes: I had a secret subtext, which I never discussed with anybody. Every time I had a scene with somebody I'd be thinking: What do you think of my hair? Do you like my hair? Do you like what they did to me? That they made me look like this? So next time you see the movie, every time I torture somebody I'm really thinking, You see what they did to me with this hair?

**Playboy**: Did you really ask ""Batman Returns"" director Tim Burton for cuff links made out of human molars?

**Walken**: I didn't ask, but it's an example of what a really good director he is. At the beginning of the shoot I was standing with him, waiting for them to light the set, and I said that in ""The Great Gatsby,"" Gatsby and Nick Carraway are having lunch with the gangster Meyer Wolfsheim, and Nick notices that Wolfsheim is wearing cuff links made out of human molars. Burton calls over his assistant and says, ""Get him cuff links made out of human molars."" Within half an hour the guy comes back with them, and I wore them throughout the movie. It's something the audience wouldn't know, but Burton knew it would be good for me to have them.

**Playboy**: Didn't Sean Penn also know what would be good for you when you acted with him in ""At Close Range""?

**Walken**: Yeah, he really scared me. You can see it on the screen, because he did it very quickly. In the middle of the take, he ran off the set and I heard him say to the propman, ""Give me the other gun."" When he came back I was concerned that this wasn't the gun he had left with. Who knows? He's acting like some crazy actor and pointing it at my face, and it really scared me. It was near my eye.

**Playboy**: Why did he do it?

**Walken**: Because he's a good actor. That's what good actors do, they help each other. It was an empty gun - he knew exactly what he was doing. He just wanted to scare me, which is what he did. I got mad afterward and yelled at him, then I said thank you. It's great when actors do that for each other. It's very generous.

**Playboy**: Penn said that you had poetry in your blood, though it was hard to know whether it was angelic or satanic.

**Walken**: That's a lovely thing to say. If you can play one, you can play the other.

**Playboy**: What about believing in one or the other?

**Walken**: Heaven and hell? No. Afterlife, absolutely. I don't believe in death. I remember standing as a child at my uncle's funeral, looking at him and thinking, I don't believe it, it doesn't make any sense. And I still feel that. The other night I was watching a movie on TV and there was an actor in it I really like. Then it crossed my mind that he's dead. But he's not dead; there he is, you know? Life is so amazing to me that I find it hard to believe it stops.

**Playboy**: You sound a bit like Whitley Strieber, who wrote about being abducted by aliens in ""Communion,"" in which you appeared when it was made into a film. Did you get to know him?

**Walken**: Yeah, it was interesting spending time with him. We went to his house once. Talk about eccentric guys. He had about a dozen people there who claimed to have been abducted. They were regular people talking about waking up with six hours missing or with scars.

**Playboy**: You've said he's like a radio show -- he does the sounds, the screams. Is this in a one-on-one conversation?

**Walken**: Absolutely. All you have to do is say, ""Whitley, did you really get abducted?"" He'll pretend at first that he's reluctant to talk about it. He's so bizarre. I asked him what happened once they got him in the spacecraft. His voice starts to shake a little, then he gets into it. He goes, ""No, no!"" \[Laughs\] He does sound effects. This guy, he's his own show.

**Playboy**: You were friendly with Andy Warhol. Did he ever want to take your picture or paint you?

**Walken**: No. Andy Warhol was famous for being reticent, but whenever I was with him we talked about movies, New York, show business. He was very congenial, very intelligent, big mind. He never said anything silly. He said things like ""I believe tomorrow is another day."" Which is silly, except when he said it you could see the mind behind it. I always thought he was rather droll. He was certainly unique.

**Playboy**: Warhol mentioned you in his diaries a few times, often having to do with a reporter named Tinkerbelle. Do you remember her?

**Walken**: Yeah, sure, I knew her. She's gone.

**Playboy**: Warhol wrote: ""She was saying how she makes out with everybody she interviews, that she was making out with Christopher Walken and that his wife was getting upset."" How did your wife know?

**Walken**: I never knew Tinkerbelle that way. I knew her from the days I used to go to the clubs. I used to see her at Studio 54.

**Playboy**: Do female reporters often come on to you?

**Walken**: No. I wouldn't mind, but ----

**Playboy**: Warhol wrote in his entry for January 16, 1979: ""Tinkerbelle said how could I tell people that she'd given Chris Walken a blow job, and I told her I didn't tell anybody, that I didn't even know.""

**Walken**: Look, I don't know, these people, really -- there are things you can say about me, but I'll deny that one absolutely.

**Playboy**: On March 14, 1985, Warhol wrote, regarding you and actor Mickey Rourke the night of Dino De Laurentiis' dinner at Alo Alo, that before Rourke left with some girls, ""he and Chris Walken kissed each other goodbye on the lips so tenderly, it looked so gay. And Chris Walken was really drunk, he said he was tired of his hair, he'd dyed it blond, and it needed retouching.""

**Walken**: \[Laughs\] I remember Mickey was there. He handed me some sort of strange green drink. Actors do kiss one another, I don't think on the lips. I don't think there's anything going on between me and Mickey. Sounds like a nice book.

**Playboy**: In 1973 you said in ""After Dark"" that you thought of Bassanio in ""The Merchant of Venice"" as bisexual, ""and I suppose that's how I think of myself, too. I'd hate to think that I was harnessed to heterosexuality . . . my head is bisexual.""

**Walken**: Did I say that? I think an actor's head has to be not bisexual but asexual. I like the term actor, it's genderless. I call actresses actors. An actor has to see as many sides of the story as possible. That's probably what I meant. But that production of ""Merchant of Venice"" had a gay bent. The director wanted it that way.

**Playboy**: What does your wife think when she hears or reads these remarks?

**Walken**: My wife is so used to me. She's heard people say many things about me.

**Playboy**: Is it true that until you were 35 you never earned more than $11,000 in a year?

**Walken**: That's right. That was my top pay for a year until I made ""The Deer Hunter,"" for which I was to be paid $14,000. But it took longer than it was supposed to, so I made $25,000. I told Michael Cimino there was this great Cadillac that I wanted, but he didn't give it to me. I've always liked Cadillacs, but I don't like to drive.

**Playboy**: So when did you finally make money?

**Walken**: Right after ""The Deer Hunter,"" when I did ""The Dogs of War."" That was the first time I was the main character.

**Playboy**: Have you ever made more than a million dollars for a film?

**Walken**: No. I made a million dollars once, but never over a million. I don't pay an awful lot of attention to money.

**Playboy**: If your films haven't always been successful, your two appearances on ""Saturday Night Live"" have been. What kind of feedback do you get when you do that show?

**Walken**: It's very good, people think it's funny. They remember certain skits. The most popular one is the Continental. A lot of people remember the stalker. We did a James Bond skit in which I played a bad guy. I was designing a shark tank, and I was going to throw people in.

**Playboy**: Do you think the show can ever return to its early glory days?

**Walken**: I don't know. I've been watching it as a fan for 22 years. Naturally when I think about the time I watched every week, it was in the beginning, with Steve Martin, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin. That was an amazing time. When Belushi would do the news and go insane, or do takeoffs on Sid Caesar or do the samurai, or Steve Martin would do his Egyptian dance, that was funny stuff. There was that white-hot thing when somebody gets very big overnight. I remember running around the halls of the Chateau Marmont with John Belushi, who lived there. I used to live on the sixth floor. There were a lot of parties in room 54, which is a nice, big suite facing Sunset.

**Playboy**: Legend has it that the ""SNL"" parties were heavy on drugs, with plates of cocaine on tables.

**Walken**: Honestly, that's like a movie. We had a scene in ""King of New York"" where there was a plate of cocaine, but I have never seen anything like that in my life. It was much more people sitting on couches, passing joints. I don't know if it's still like that. I hear all kinds of things about what people use. It's changed. The pills that put you in an ecstatic state - people didn't used to take pills. And I've heard that heroin is getting cheaper. That sounds pretty nasty.

**Playboy**: Is there a lot of jealousy among your peers? We've heard that you get jealous of men but not of women. True?

**Walken**: Not as an actor. In life, it's a guy taking away your girlfriend. Nowadays, getting older, I find myself around guys who are annoying because they're a little too young, a little too good-looking, a little too sure of themselves. I'm like that with my wife. The other day we had a driver who was a young, good-looking guy. He was talking to her and I thought he was a little cocky and flirty. I found myself staring at him, like, Kid, should I eat you from your toes or from your nose?

**Playboy**: Are you glad that you are not a woman?

**Walken**: I'm glad I'm not a woman for a lot of reasons. Guys have a better deal, that's all there is to it. In every way. It's just better to be born a boy child. I'm not saying that men are better; it's just that men and women are very different. There is no comparison in terms of anything. That whole thing of giving birth? That's a frame of mind that's impossible for a man to know. Getting a hard-on, that's something a woman will never understand. It has nothing to do with more or less or better or quality of mind, but it's like men have a better agent or something. They come into the world with a better shake at a career and all sorts of things. John Gielgud just had his 93rd birthday and had to rush off to do a shoot somewhere. So he's working. That's what I want. I want to do a Pinter play when I'm 92.

**Playboy**: Do you ever worry about that not happening? What is your greatest fear?

**Walken**: I'm afraid of crazy people. I'm afraid of speeding cars. I'm afraid of accidents. I'm afraid of disease. I'm very nervous getting on the L.A. freeways with a driver. They drive so fast that if something were to happen you'd be creamed. The 50-mile-per-hour limit was very sensible.

**Playboy**: What's the most scared you've ever been?

**Walken**: The time I was trapped in an elevator with an 800-pound gorilla.

**Playboy**: Seriously.

**Walken**: Baudelaire once said, ""I have felt the wind of the wings of madness."" That happened to me once in my 40s and I got really scared.

**Playboy**: Did you need professional help?

**Walken**: I tried that once, two or three visits. He was a very nice man, and I said to him, ""I don't think this is the thing I should be doing."" And he said, ""I think you're right."" You have to have a sense of yourself and a perspective on life, sometimes taking a broader view and realizing you can be more daring with your mind, not be so afraid, just dive in.

**Playboy**: How far in does your mind take you sometimes?

**Walken**: That's the problem -- I found in my life that I was the least interesting when I was introspective. I did the least interesting work, I was the least interesting to be around. But a lot of my troubles were absolute bullshit compared with people who have cancer or have had something happen to their family.

**Playboy**: Well, feeling the wings of madness is pretty serious.

**Walken**: Yeah, but all sorts of dopey people go crazy. Going crazy has a certain amount of vanity connected to it. Realizing there's a sort of self-centered, whining thing in you -- just be brave. Somebody said to me once, ""We're all dealt a hand."" Some people get dealt better hands than others. That's why it's no good to be jealous of others. Everybody's at the center of something. The most you can do is to be your own unique self.

**Playboy**: After spending some time with you, it's impossible not to notice how fastidious you are. Are you obsessed with cleanliness?

**Walken**: It's funny you say that. To me it's an absolute necessity. Everybody should be that way. Cleanliness is a good thing. I'm very clean. I don't like things that aren't cleaned up. But I hardly use soap at all. I don't use a lot of soap because it makes me feel sticky. I don't like to use it in my hair -- I usually just run it under the water.

**Playboy**: Which housekeeping chores do you do?

**Walken**: I do most of the cooking. My wife cleans. When I'm in a hotel I make my own food and I clean up, too.

**Playboy**: Why is everything good fattening?

**Walken**: That's not true. The food I eat is good, and it's not fatty. I'm sort of a Japanese-Italian cook. In California you can get Chilean sea bass, which I can't get back East. The Chinese say there's only one way to cook fish -- steam it. I take my collapsible steamer with me wherever I go. I cut the tops of leeks and steam them soft, then lay the sea bass on them and add a little dill, salt, pepper. When you take it out the sea bass flakes off in slabs. Absolutely divine.

**Playboy**: Do you chew gum?

**Walken**: No.

**Playboy**: Eat chocolate?

**Walken**: No. I don't do sugar. It has a chemical effect on me. There are very few things that get me tense. I can drink a lot of coffee. But if I have half a soda I get wired.

**Playboy**: How superstitious are you?

**Walken**: Very. About everything. Not the standard stuff. My superstitions are mysterious and very powerful. They do not have names. I pay attention.

**Playboy**: Tell us a little more than that.

**Walken**: I can't. You're saying don't be mysterious about something mysterious. What I'm saying is, if I have a feeling, I obey it.

**Playboy**: If you could change one thing about yourself, what would it be?

**Walken**: I'd be more entrepreneurial. I'm lazy. I wish I could be more of a business guy. I admire that. I read the business section of ""The New York Times"" every week. I'm amazed by guys who understand how companies are run. Managerial types of things. It's so foreign to me. It's being like a general, which is sort of what directing is. Having a finger in many different pots and pies at the same time.

**Playboy**: Well, we've come to the end. Is there anything you regret talking about?

**Walken**: There was one thing that bothered me, and it was my fault: when I said I'm 54 years old and the only person I know is Harry Dean Stanton. It's the only thing I said that I wish I hadn't because it's not nice to Harry Dean, and I didn't mean it that way. It's actually sort of the truth, but I don't want Harry Dean to take it the wrong way.

**Playboy**: Harry Dean should be honored to be in such exclusive company.

**Playboy**: How do you feel when you read an article about yourself that begins: ""There are lots of spooky actors in the world, but none more spooky than Christopher Walken""? Or, ""Christopher Walken is the creepiest man on the screen""?

**Christopher Walken**: I hope I'm not creepy. Creepy is not a mammal. Creepy is like an insect. Spooky is OK. Racehorses get spooked, they're emotional.

**Playboy**: Still, spooky doesn't often translate into heroic or good-guy roles.

**Walken**: I am a good guy, no doubt about it. Just ask my family. Whatever you are in the movies comes from what you actually are. One thing an actor does in his life is to try to find the pure place.

**Playboy**: So you would like some romantic leads?

**Walken**: I'd like to be acting, and acting in ways that surprise people. If that would be a surprise, sure.

**Playboy**: And how would you describe yourself?

**Walken**: Unexpectedly conservative. Anybody who gets to know me is surprised. My life is quiet. I like it that way. I'm very sensible and pragmatic. If somebody were to do the story of my life, not that anybody would, it would be about my wife and me around the house. It would be like watching paint dry.

**Playboy**: What does stardom mean to you?

**Walken**: I don't know what stardom is. Somebody once said to me, ""I saw you in this play."" And I thought, Wow, somebody saw me, because only about three people saw that play. I felt very famous. I've always been recognizable, even before I became famous. The way I dress, my hair, I stick out a little.

**Playboy**: Would you consider yourself flamboyant?

**Walken**: A little, yeah. Garish. Especially when I was younger -- I was always a bit exotic. Never wore a hat because the hair was more important.

**Playboy**: You seldom get top billing. Why is that?

**Walken**: Usually the villain is the supporting actor. But you know that before you make the movie; that's all decided by your lawyer. Whenever I go to do a movie, my agent and lawyer always fight for things. One will say, ""If we don't argue about the billing it will be easier with the money."" And I'll say, ""Yeah, right."" And then the other guy will call me and say, ""Look, Chris, you have to put your foot down. We have to fight for this."" And I'll say, ""Yeah, right."" So then they argue, and usually they know what I want, which is basically: Take the job, who cares? It's much more important to stick around. Being an actor is hard. So many people want your job.

**Playboy**: It's been said that you bring to your roles a special way of seeing pain that other actors rarely come close to. Do you understand this?

**Walken**: I hope I bring a special way of seeing something. People are so mysterious, you can't ever really know anyone. I never know what anybody's thinking. When my nephew was five and his mother was going to have another baby, he said to me, ""Uncle Ronnie, my mother and father think I'm upset because there's a baby coming. I want you to let them know that I'm not, that I'm looking forward to it, because I've been lonely."" That's at five!

**Playboy**: Are you always Ronnie to your friends and family?

**Walken**: Oh yeah. My wife, people who knew me as a kid, sure. Anybody who met me after I was 25 calls me Chris. I asked my agent if I could change my billing to Chris Walken. It's what everybody calls me, and it takes up less space. It's easier to say. But people don't like change. Producers say, ""If I paid for the full name, I'm getting the full name."" Why can't I go to Chris? I wish Playboy would use Chris.

**Playboy**: OK, Chris, are you concerned about your roles as a bad guy capable of killing children, friends or co-workers? You have said you tend to play mostly villains and twisted people because of the way you look. Do you think you look evil? Is there a concern that you might become a parody of yourself?

**Walken**: You know what I think it is? I've been in show business since I was three, and it has left its mark on me. I come from the planet Show Business, not Hollywood -- I didn't know anything about that until I got older. But I came out of show business: The way I talk, the way I think, the way I look -- those things make me good for certain kinds of parts, somebody from the outside, from the border. When I was young I never knew anybody who wasn't in show business. Remember Brandon de Wilde? He was a great-looking kid and a big star, he was in ""Shane."" I went to school with him. He taught me how to tie a necktie. I was in class with Marvin Hamlisch. I knew him when I was seven. When he was ten he had already written an opera. Tuesday Weld used to come to our house. Sal Mineo was in school with Elliott Gould and my brother. Sal was a bigger star than anybody. He had an older brother named Vic, and these guys wore suits, had bodyguards, played cards on the weekends. These guys were 40 when they were 16. I was always at the edge, looking on.

**Playboy**: Were you jealous of their success?

**Walken**: I don't have a big jealous streak. But sometimes I feel depressed about not being better.

**Playboy**: Did many of those showbiz kids continue like you did?

**Walken**: Not many. It's unusual if they're still in the business. They grew up and had something else they wanted to do. But not me. I got to be 25 and realized I was in show business whether I liked it or not.

**Playboy**: Is that when you made the transition from musicals to dramatic stage roles?

**Walken**: I knew I couldn't stay in musicals. Even if you are great at it, there's only so long you can do it, like an athlete. I was in a musical and a casting agent saw me and asked me to audition for ""The Lion in Winter,"" which was a play in New York before it was a movie. I got the part of the king of France. It had great actors in it: Robert Preston, who was like Booth, a great American actor; Rosemary Harris; Jimmy Rado, who later wrote ""Hair."" It was a good show. Preston was sweet to me. He used to say, ""Don't worry, just enjoy yourself. Don't stand in the wings and say your lines over and over before you go on. You know your lines -- just relax."" And I'd grit my teeth and say, ""Yeah!"" Anyway, I'd go out there and pour a cup of wine and hand it to somebody, and my hand would be shaking so hard that the wine would jump out of the goblet. I really stunk. People would come backstage afterward and say to me, ""I'm sorry."" And one night after the show the producer asked me to get a bite to eat and took me to this Greek restaurant. He said in the middle of our meal, ""We're going to have to let you go."" I said, ""I know that. But give me three days."" He said OK. Within those three days I got my shit together.

**Playboy**: Why stay with acting if it made your hands shake?

**Walken**: What else could I do?

**Playboy**: You won a Clarence Derwent Award for that play. What did this mean to you?

**Walken**: I had gone from tap dancing to getting an award for being an actor in a play I nearly got fired from. This showed me things weren't so bad after all. I got a job as Romeo and I had never read Shakespeare. I'm convinced I got that job because somebody had seen me wearing tights in ""The Lion in Winter"" and thought I could play Romeo. It's dopey, but I think that's what happened. I was terrible as Romeo. And I got the worst reviews ever.

**Playboy**: Do you have many actor friends? When you're working here in Hollywood, who do you see?

**Walken**: I know people here like Harry Dean Stanton. I'm trying to think of who else actually lives here. Oh, Jon Lovitz. \[Laughs\] I'm 54 years old. You ask, ""Who do you know?"" I say, ""I know Harry Dean Stanton.""

**Playboy**: What playwrights are you most comfortable with?

**Walken**: My best work onstage has been in Tennessee Williams' plays and in Chekhov's. American stage actors for some reason go very well with Chekhov. Some sort of temperamental thing. And Williams was the great American playwright of my time. One thing I know about playwrights: Every character they write is them. Shakespeare wrote all those characters, and somewhere in his head he could imagine them. It's the only thing good playwrights and bad playwrights have in common: Their characters are basically them.

**Playboy**: Does that hold true for actors who write?

**Walken**: Sure. I've never met an actor who hasn't written a movie. I've got volumes of them. Cabdrivers write screenplays. My dentist told me he wrote one.

**Playboy**: Did he give it to you?

**Walken**: No. But he wants to. I think I said to him, ""I don't want to know about it. What's it about?"" ""It's about a dentist."" They don't make movies about dentists!

**Playboy**: Has anybody ever read any of your screenplays?

**Walken**: No, because they stink! \[Laughs\] I've got a trunkful of shitty scripts. When I finish one I say, ""OK, that's pretty good for a lousy rotten actor.""

**Playboy**: What was your mother's fascination with show business that led her to encourage you in that direction?

**Walken**: It was different in those days. There was a thing called the Stage Mothers' Society, 300 women who had kids. There were three professional children's schools that catered to those kids. I went 12 years, from the first grade until I graduated from high school. We went to dancing school on Saturdays and it was as much a social event for the mothers as it was tap class for us. They would all sit and drink black coffee and smoke cigarettes and argue. I don't know about what, but I remember big arguments. It was pretty tough.

**Playboy**: Were you a good student?

**Walken**: I was never good in school. I didn't like it and always resented having to attend.

**Playboy**: Why?

**Walken**: I don't have children, and I know the law makes you do things, but I think you should basically teach a kid to read. A little arithmetic, a little writing, but if you can read, that's the big thing. That's the biggest thing my education gave me.

**Playboy**: If you had kids, would you encourage them to go to school?

**Walken**: No, I wouldn't. I think school may do as much damage as good. It did to me. It was just something you did every day. It was taken for granted. You waste tremendous amounts of time.

**Playboy**: You apparently felt that way about Hofstra University, which you left after a year.

**Walken**: I mean, it wasn't Harvard. I was in a play by Archibald MacLeish, ""J.B.,"" when I was 16 or 17. I was about to get out of high school. One of my teachers said, ""You're working with Archibald MacLeish?"" He was teaching at Harvard. She said, ""Why don't you ask him to put in a word for you? You could probably go to Harvard."" I didn't want to go to Harvard.

**Playboy**: What musical did you leave college for?

**Walken**: ""Best Foot Forward."" I was 19, making $55 a week. Liza Minnelli sang a song for this investor -- she made quite an impression. That's how we got the money to do the show. Her mother threw a 16th-birthday party for her, and the cast was invited. I danced with Judy Garland.

**Playboy**: Wasn't it at this time that you met Anthony Perkins, who gave you some essential advice about your hair?

**Walken**: Right. He had a great head of hair. He said the reason men go bald, aside from genes, is that as they get older, the scalp gets tight, the blood gets cut off and the follicles die, particularly with stress. He knew a lot about it. He said that women have a layer of lanolin under their skin that men don't have that keeps their scalps loose. He told me what you do is pull your hair forward five minutes a day, and I've done it every morning since. You take your whole scalp and just pull it pretty hard, yank it around. I heard that Kennedy, when he was in the White House, had somebody come in every day and do it for him. He had a great head of hair.

**Playboy**: What other beauty secrets do you know?

**Walken**: If you've got red eyes from staying up too late you should put warm, wet tea bags on them. It's very soothing.

**Playboy**: After ""Best Foot Forward,"" you did the road show of ""West Side Story,"" during which you met Georgianne Thon. Describe that meeting.

**Walken**: She played my girlfriend in the show, so we were together every day, touring on the road.

**Playboy**: Was it love at first sight?

**Walken**: She was a fox. She is a fox. We loved each other right away. We've been married 28 years. I was 22 when we met.

**Playboy**: Why haven't you had kids?

**Walken**: I never had it checked out. My wife and I were never interested in having kids. We're both relieved that we don't. We've been careful, and we've deliberately avoided it. Until I was 35 I moved around all the time. The truth is, I don't really enjoy the company of children. When I'm with them I think, Gee, I wish this would end so I could have a conversation or something.

**Playboy**: Is your wife your best friend?

**Walken**: Definitely.

**Playboy**: She has said that she stays away from you when you're playing darker roles. True?

**Walken**: She's told me that, too.

**Playboy**: You must not be seeing much of her lately.

**Walken**: There are some roles that are difficult for her. People won't say, ""Come on, honey, let's take the kids to see 'The Comfort of Strangers.'"" That's not going to happen.

**Playboy**: You've said that your character in that movie got to you. In what way?

**Walken**: I did something I never do for movies: I deliberately gained weight, 20 pounds. And I don't do things like that for parts. I don't like to be fat. I felt lousy.

**Playboy**: You called your character a terrible man and said the fact that sex equals death in that movie scared you.

**Walken**: He and his wife did make that equation, yeah. And not in a funny way, like Woody Allen might do. That is the most mentally unhealthy person I've ever played, which says a lot.

**Playboy**: You played a pretty unstable guy, Annie Hall's demented brother, for Allen.

**Walken**: Somebody at a press conference came up to me and said, ""I know why you get these strange parts. It's because you did that Woody Allen movie."" I thought, Could that be? Everybody saw that movie, in which I played Duane, who wanted to drive into oncoming cars. It could be I got the part in ""The Deer Hunter"" because of that.

**Playboy**: ""The Deer Hunter,"" it's been written, established you as an intellectual James Dean. Do you buy that?

**Walken**: No, certainly not.

**Playboy**: Many saw it as a political film, but you didn't. How come?

**Walken**: Because I see movies as movies. But if you want me to be more specific, I don't think it had anything to do with being about a particular war. It had more to do with young men's romantic notions of war, the idea that war's an adventure. They think they're going to go and have a good time, get out of the house. In reality, though, they get their legs blown off. But you could have made that movie about cavemen. It's really more about young men's naivete concerning war.

**Playboy**: Where did you stand on the Vietnam war?

**Walken**: It's maybe not a good thing about me, but I have never paid attention to what's going on in the world. I knew peripherally, but I had no views.

**Playboy**: What about your brothers?

**Walken**: My younger brother volunteered to go, and he went for four years. He was in action in Vietnam. He never talks about it, but I have a feeling he was in rough stuff.

**Playboy**: What did he think of ""The Deer Hunter""?

**Walken**: He's never talked about it.

**Playboy**: How uncomfortable did it get shooting in the River Kwai?

**Walken**: There were little things nipping at our legs. That's why I liked making ""Nick of Time"" - it was all inside the Bonaventure Hotel. You'd go to your room for lunch, go back downstairs and get to work. That's the way to do it. ""The Deer Hunter"" was in the jungle, with lizards, spiders. We stayed in this hotel, and at night there'd be a noise. You'd turn on the light and there would be a lizard on the wall, white with big orange dots on it. I'm very squeamish about that stuff. I don't like bugs. But it got to the point where I'd hear a noise, turn on the light, see something on the wall, turn off the light and go back to sleep.

**Playboy**: Did you ever smoke opium in Thailand?

**Walken**: Somebody gave me some and I didn't know what to do with it, so I ate it after we finished the movie. I stayed in Thailand for a while and went up to this place called Pe Lot. It was like a town in a Western, with wooden sidewalks and guys carrying guns. I ate the opium and got very, very sick. It was an intestinal thing. When I got back to America I saw a doctor, who said that they mix the opium with water buffalo shit and that I had some bacteria in my stomach. It lasted a long time.

**Playboy**: What were the Sixties like for you? Did you go through a drug phase?

**Walken**: Sure.

**Playboy**: Did it affect you?

**Walken**: Yes, but it affected me for the better. It's the reason I don't do it anymore and wouldn't even be inclined or tempted. When it stopped being interesting, I stopped being interested in it. It was a relationship. We gave up on each other.

**Playboy**: You never had a bad acid trip?

**Walken**: Oh sure, sure, and when that happened I stopped. I don't even hear acid mentioned anymore. But it was commonplace then. It's like smoking cigarettes - there was a time in my late 30s when they started to make me feel sick, so I quit. I'm very lucky that way. There's a point where your body and your mind say what you should do, and if you ignore that, you're a fool.

**Playboy**: How good was winning an Oscar for ""The Deer Hunter""?

**Walken**: I remember exactly how good. We went to the thing and there was a little party afterward and we sat with Meryl Streep and her family, then went back to the hotel early. The management had sent up a bottle of champagne, my agent was in the room with a couple of people, I was holding the Oscar. Then everybody left and we went to bed and I said to my wife, with the Oscar in my hand, ""This is a house."" And it was. I was holding our house in my hand - I knew that's what it meant.

**Playboy**: Another controversial film for you was ""Brainstorm,"" which was delayed when Natalie Wood drowned after falling off the yacht that you, she and Robert Wagner were staying on. You have maintained a strict silence about the incident ----

**Walken**: Out of respect for the family. It's not my place to talk about that. The other thing is, there really is nothing to talk about. Anybody there saw the logistics - of the boat, the night, where we were, that it was raining - and would know exactly what happened. You hear about things happening to people - they slip in the bathtub, fall down the stairs, step off the curb in London because they think that the cars come the other way - and they die. You feel you want to die making an effort at something; you don't want to die in some unnecessary way.

What happened that night only she knows, because she was alone. There were four of us on that boat, not three of us. There was a captain too. She had gone to bed before us, and her room was at the back. A dinghy was bouncing against the side of the boat, and I think she went out to move it. There was a ski ramp that was partially in the water. It was slippery - I had walked on it myself. She had told me she couldn't swim; in fact, they had to cut a swimming scene from the movie. She was probably half asleep, and she was wearing a coat.

She apparently moved the boat around, slipped, hit her head, fell into the water. She was discovered separate from the boat: Why would she get into the boat, then get out of it and into the water? She couldn't swim. She hit her head, went into the water, the boat floated away, she floated away. In the meantime, we were sitting in the living room, the three of us, talking. And I remember distinctly that about 45 minutes after she had gone to bed, R.J. went down to her room, came right back and said, ""Natalie's not there."" And then the Coast Guard was called. I feel funny talking about it in such detail, but the fact that she had gone in the dinghy the night before made it sound like we were on the high seas. We were 50 feet off the beach, moored to one of those balls, and there were boats all around. It was a drizzly night, so it wasn't like people were sitting out on their decks. But there were a lot of people around. There was a hotel with a restaurant on the shore.

She had gone there the night before to call her kids because the phone on the boat wasn't working. The first assumption was that that's what she had done. She was very spontaneous. The idea that she had gotten into the boat to go call her kids was not far-fetched. The first reaction was: I hope everything's OK. But then time passed.

**Playboy**: Thomas Noguchi, the Los Angeles County coroner, reported that an argument between you and Wagner may have been the reason she went off by herself.

**Walken**: Wasn't that guy Noguchi kicked out as chief medical examiner for being an asshole?

**Playboy**: He said you guys were fighting.

**Walken**: I remember that. There was a quote in the paper from me saying I didn't recall the coroner being there. How the hell does the coroner know what was going on?

**Playboy**: What was reported in the ""Los Angeles Times"" was that you and Wagner ""argued heatedly aboard an anchored yacht"" on the night that Natalie Wood drowned. ""It may have been the reason she left the two men.""

**Walken**: She left to go to bed. And there were three of us. Noguchi was a bad man. How would he know? If a policeman had said it, it would be one thing. The police thoroughly investigated the whole thing, everybody was questioned. If there had been anything wrong, certainly the police would have looked into it. The story I just told you is the absolute truth. Nobody can know, but I believe she went to move that dinghy, slipped, fell, hit her head and died. Not a good way to go. The woman was not self-destructive. Everybody cared about her. This is the first time I've ever talked more than two minutes about it.

**Playboy**: When did they find the body?

**Walken**: A few hours later.

**Playboy**: What was your reaction?

**Walken**: Oh man, forget it. My reaction was for R.J. to receive that kind of news.

**Playboy**: Have you two seen or talked with each other since then?

**Walken**: I bump into him occasionally, and, you know, it's sad. He married her twice. They really were a glamorous couple.

**Playboy**: Were you close to her?

**Walken**: They were very nice to me. They invited me to their home. We had a lot of fun. To have something like that happen to someone who really was loved and who was legendary - the sadness of it makes it hard to talk about. I was in a restaurant about a year ago, and there was a young, beautiful girl. I was looking at her and somebody said to me, ""You know who that is? It's Natalie's daughter Natasha."" There was a resemblance.

**Playboy**: Did you ever talk to Wood about her early films?

**Walken**: I did, yes. She talked about those people. She had dated Elvis. She was Elvis' girlfriend at one point. She talked about what a gentleman he was. She knew everybody.

I don’t want to leave without saying goodbye.,"I (24M) recently graduated as an international student in the U.S., and I’m set to return to Dubai in five days. My girlfriend (18F) and I had been together for almost a year, officially in a relationship for six months. We started dating when she was 18 and I was 23.
From the beginning, I was open with her about the possibility of going long distance after I graduated. She always said she was okay with it, and we tried to build something real despite knowing that deadline was coming.
But we had our share of issues. We’d fight about things like her drinking, wearing revealing clothes, and even her grabbing coffee one-on-one with her gay guy friends. I fully admit I felt insecure, not proud of it, and I let those insecurities show in unhealthy ways.
She eventually broke up with me, saying I was immature and needed to work on myself. I called her right away, apologized, and we got back together. But two days later, she ended things again for the same reasons. I kept trying. I sent heartfelt messages. She took me back again.
We started talking seriously about long-distance. She wanted to know a clear timeline, when I’d come back to the U.S. I told her I didn’t have a definite plan yet. She didn’t want to move to Dubai or even meet halfway. She expected me to do all the compromising.
Eventually, she broke up with me again, this time for good. She told me never to contact her again and that if I did, she’d block me. I panicked. I texted her right after to tell her I’d stay for her, I’d delay going back to Dubai, but she blocked me. In that moment of panic and heartbreak, I called her older sister (30F), who I’d spoken to before. I broke down crying while explaining everything to her.
A few days later, I texted my ex again asking her to reconsider, but she didn’t reply.
Now I’m five days from leaving the country, and it’s tearing me apart that I won’t get to say goodbye. I understand she set a boundary, but I’m struggling with the fact that a person I loved this deeply could cut me off completely. I don’t want to push her further away, but I feel like I’m leaving with this huge emotional knot in my chest.

1n8t9nq,https://www.reddit.com/r/clinicalresearch/comments/1n8t9nq/meeting_requests/,Meeting requests,"Hope the sub can help me. 

TLDR: Why all the meeting requests from ‘trial leads’ alongside major conferences?

I am a PI at a government academic research institute in Australia. As we serve a very large and socioeconomically deprived health population, we are generally a very good recruiting site for commercial/pharma trials. We are expensive too. But companies keep coming. PIs like me do these trials for no payment from the institution. We are expected to do them as part of our affiliation with a major research institute. And it gets access to new treatments for my patients. 

Around every conference, I get asked by ‘global clinical program leads’ from the sponsor side (big pharma) for meetings. Until the last conference, I diligently said yes to all the meeting requests. But I never got the point of these meetings. We would just sit and chat about sweet nothings for 30 minutes. They would say my site is recruiting fine and we would shake hands and walk away. I would do this with a few companies a day for the three day conference. 

This next major conference is coming up. Again, my email is filling up with meeting requests from various pharma sponsors of trials I am recruiting for locally. We are the top recruiting site nationally for these studies. I pushed back and said I don’t want to do these meetings with the first junior associate who emailed me. I said I didn’t see the point. I got a pleading email from the ‘global program lead’ to please make time for “a coffee at least”. I have relented and agreed to one meeting. 

I really don’t see the point of these meetings. Am I a metric at these meetings? Am I helping these people tick a box for their superiors? I would much rather just go and listen to some exciting talks at the conference. Or meet old friends. Will I be shooting myself/my site in the foot by saying no?

Is this what being medicated is like because if so I need it. Sorry if this sounds stupid. ,1,1757038706.0,adhdwomen,2,1.0,False

I don’t want to leave without saying goodbye.,"I (24M) recently graduated as an international student in the U.S., and I’m set to return to Dubai in five days. My girlfriend (18F) and I had been together for almost a year, officially in a relationship for six months. We started dating when she was 18 and I was 23.
From the beginning, I was open with her about the possibility of going long distance after I graduated. She always said she was okay with it, and we tried to build something real despite knowing that deadline was coming.
But we had our share of issues. We’d fight about things like her drinking, wearing revealing clothes, and even her grabbing coffee one-on-one with her gay guy friends. I fully admit I felt insecure, not proud of it, and I let those insecurities show in unhealthy ways.
She eventually broke up with me, saying I was immature and needed to work on myself. I called her right away, apologized, and we got back together. But two days later, she ended things again for the same reasons. I kept trying. I sent heartfelt messages. She took me back again.
We started talking seriously about long-distance. She wanted to know a clear timeline, when I’d come back to the U.S. I told her I didn’t have a definite plan yet. She didn’t want to move to Dubai or even meet halfway. She expected me to do all the compromising.
Eventually, she broke up with me again, this time for good. She told me never to contact her again and that if I did, she’d block me. I panicked. I texted her right after to tell her I’d stay for her, I’d delay going back to Dubai, but she blocked me. In that moment of panic and heartbreak, I called her older sister (30F), who I’d spoken to before. I broke down crying while explaining everything to her.
A few days later, I texted my ex again asking her to reconsider, but she didn’t reply.
Now I’m five days from leaving the country, and it’s tearing me apart that I won’t get to say goodbye. I understand she set a boundary, but I’m struggling with the fact that a person I loved this deeply could cut me off completely. I don’t want to push her further away, but I feel like I’m leaving with this huge emotional knot in my chest.
I don’t know if I should try to say goodbye one last time or just walk away in silence.

TL;DR:
My 18F girlfriend broke up with me a few days ago after a year of dating. I’m leaving the U.S. (where we met) in five days, possibly forever. I want to say goodbye, but she told me not to contact her and blocked me. I’m heartbroken and don’t know how to find closure.",0,1757038605.0,relationships,8,0.25,False

I started dating my boyfriend in October 2024. About 2 weeks into semi regularly seeing him, I attempted to cuddle with him on the couch. He stopped me and said “what are you doing? We’ve only known each other 2 weeks”… I was really taken back but maybe he’s right?


To give context on where I’m at in this now, fast forward 10 months, he doesn’t cuddle, rarely initiates sex, lets me give him blowjobs then doesn’t do anything for me, when he first started fucking me, it felt magical. He was insanely good. He took his time with me, dirty talked me. Now I feel like a masturbation sleeve. No post sex cuddles. No post sex talking even. He just turns on the tv and rolls over to go to sleep eventually. Not a goodnight. It took him 8 months to say I love you, I cracked and said it first during a fight. We hardly kiss, and if we do it’s just a little peck. we used to make out. Now that he has me, he doesn’t want to kiss me. Everything that goes wrong is my fault, I’m too sensitive, “my feelings are my own problem to deal with”, I need too much, wanting affection is “hallmark 7th grade bullshit, he’s a man”


Anyways,


Here are some key moments that I can’t choke down and don’t know if I’m over reacting or not. 


I had 2 cats, 5 and 7 years old. With me since babies. My whole heart. He knew they existed. But then 4 months into dating, he said he’s highly allergic to cats, can barely breathe, etc. 
He still let them come to the house for a trial period. It went horribly. There’s no doubt he’s allergic to cats. I tried everything, hepa, food changed, bathes, deep cleaning, didn’t matter. 

He said if I want to make this work they have to be rehomed. 
I am 32, desperate to get married and have a family. He said he’s slow to open up, would become more affectionate with time, would never hurt me, when he loves he loves hard, it’s just slower for him. 

I lost my tenancy at my house. I couldn’t afford anything else on the rental market, and he kept telling me the relationship felt stagnant and idle until I move in. 
I felt backed against a corner. I had to give away my cats. They’ve been rehomed twice. They didn’t work out at the first place. I want to kill myself. I miss them so much. I feel like I made such a big mistake.  He offered me no support during this. When I’d cry about them he would get mad and storm out. He never held me through it, never said it’s going to be okay, this is for our future, nothing reassuring. I am still grieving them like it happened yesterday. It’s been 2 months. I cry in private all the time, im scared for him to see me cry because of how he reacts. He has never asked how I’m doing. 

I moved in, and I had to throw nearly everything I own out. All I have is my bed and my clothes. My decade of building up is gone. He had no room for my stuff. He’s a minimalist. I can have one coffee cup, etc. 
When I had to throw everything out manually myself, he was never around. He was out working out, at his shop dicking around, etc. I had to actually ask him to come help me, and then he’d just show up and start shoving everything into garbage bags, not asking me or working with me, just treating my stuff like it’s all garbage. And then get pissed off when I’d say “hey wait that thing is really important to me”

When I have emotions he loses it on me. He’s called me a lazy bitch for letting dishes and laundry pile for 3 days right after I gave my cats away and was grieving and in distress. He’s called me a cunt, told me to shut the fuck up. I’m immature. A real woman would hold shit down, Get a grip, he’s thrown things at walls, walked out on me and slammed doors, whipped his iPad at me after asking for help fixing an issue with it, etc. the only way this doesn’t happen, is if I keep my mouth shut, do what needs to be done, don’t ask for affection and connection, and just be there for him. His idea of intimacy is sitting on opposite sides of the couch and grabbing my arm or leg for 2 minutes once per night. 

Once I moved in, he invested a substantial amount of money into me, 12.5k, to get corrective surgery on a ton of loose skin I had from weight loss. I didn’t ask him to help me. He just did and said I don’t need to pay him back. Now I feel stuck. I took the offer because I felt like I’d just given up everything, yes please make an investment back into me. 

I had surgery and was supposed to be very low activity for 4-6 weeks

I didn’t do dishes or sweep or laundry for a few days and he had a meltdown over the state the house was becoming. I started doing all the chores again (I cook every single night from scratch, clean, dishes, sweep, mop, changed out garbages, laundry, wash and fold. He says he’s responsible for outside, fixing, taking garbage to dump)

I started doing all the chores again, and I had several complications where I needed to emergency meet with my surgeon twice because of over strain. I was scared of making him mad, and he wasn’t helping at all or offering. 
After the second wound opening, he said “don’t lift a finger. I’ll be the muscles”. Well guess what? There’s been laundry baskets sitting unfolded for 5 days, we’re sleeping in a mattress cover because he won’t put the sheet on (I’m scared to move my arms like that) the dishes pile up, and I’m still cooking dinner and dishes and sweeping and mopping.  

But now the surgery is over, my cats are gone, my heart is broken, my stuff is in the landfill, I am… a shell of the person I was when I first met him. 

I don’t get affection. He winces when I try to kiss him or get close with him. He keeps everting surface level. He won’t tell me about his past. He won’t ask about mine and said he doesn’t want to know.
Everything is surface level
I am lonely. I’m so lonely. But I keep gaslighting myself, like he spent so much money on me that he didn’t necessarily have to just throw around, he’s trying to show love I guess? But I’m so fucking empty. I want him so bad. I want all of him and for him to want all of me. I’m so empty. 

Am I hallmark? Am I too needy? Am I expecting too much? He has said “I’m a grown fucking man” a few times when I bid for connection. He said what he looks for in a a woman is someone who’s sweet, calm, loving, supportive. 

I am all of those things, but when you want a woman like that, she’s going to be affectionate and starve for some connection. That’s part of what makes her sweet and supportive. 

I constantly just want to go beg for my cats back and move into my parents. But I keep holding this hope he will snap out and love me more. Am I wanting too much from a grown “real” man?

Oh boy, I was feeling good about grad school, that I had it all sorted, now I’m rethinking everything. So, I have this His-tagged recombinant protein, I'm trying to pull out of E. coli lysate. Purification wise, I’ve been toying some back and forth with Ni-NTA columns in a normal-ish (50 mM Tris pH8, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole) lysis buffer and 250 mM imidizole ramps. First couple of runs, looked good on SDSPAGE – ncie band at \~50 kDA – and also all over the floor, then crashed like a mofo, 1 mg/L, aggregaint like mad post-dialysis into PBS.

Now the boss is insisting that he's ""characterization"" data first before we go to assay. Did that mean just running more gels, or something more than that? I've used SEC to look at oligomeric state, but the peaks are very broad. DLS shows polydispersity hell. Am I missing steps? Is, like, purification just separating the damn thing from everything else, and characterization being determining whether it is folded correctly, or if it’s active, or what its internal structure looks like using CD spectroscopy or mass spec?

3. It's up to 10%.  I work happily for a few hours.
4. And then I walk away or go to bed and the next day I go ""OMG I forgot to put it on the charger!""
5. Go back to #1 and repeat.

Eventually I charge it, but it sure isn't a natural thing for me.  I like the mouse, I don't really want a new one.  I even 3D printed a little charging stand, thinking I would train myself to make it ""the home"" for the mouse.

I went to the dentist in May, 8 months after my last cleaning due to having to move to a different dentist. At that appointment they had said I had 10 cavities across my mouth and made me schedule 3 appointments. They led me to believe I don’t take care of my teeth properly and they even gave me a prescription toothpaste. (Mind you, my last appointment I had 0) Well, after my first 2 appointments, my third one came. The first two appointments I had the same dental hygienist, but my third appointment I had a different one. The different hygienist had to file down areas that the first hygienist didn’t properly file, and they even had to redo a filling from the second appointment. Fast forward to today, I was taking a drink of my coffee when I felt some sensitive pain where my filling from the first appointment was done. (They only did one and put medication on two others during the first appointment) then, while I was eating I felt something hard and it looked like a whitish color and it was hard. When I got home and went to get a snack and drink, I felt more pain, checked the mirror and realized my filling was missing and that’s why I had pain. I have not ate anything hard to cause it to come out either. It literally just fell out and caused me discomfort. Now I have a hole in between my teeth.

also, last time I went to this dentist in 2021(I switched after this)I had a dentist tell me I needed emergency surgery before I’m 16 or I’ll lose all my teeth. I turn 16 next May and haven’t lost any (my gum and lip are too attatched somewhere, but other dentists had said it was fine.

location: Ohio

edit: I went back the Wednesday after this post. I asked for the second hygienist (both were certified to do the fillings). I got there around 7:30 am, they opened at 8, but we sat in the lobby area. When I was taken into the room, the hygienist did some examination of the area, saying that there’s an area she can go into with the tool, so she went and got Dr. J. Dr. J and my mom talked about why I had this treament, minus the front bc those were needed. He said that most were right beside each other and wanted to keep me from having to come back in the future to do the same area + one of the cavities made its way more inside the tooth, which decays faster and he showed us the x-rays. He fixed the filling and while the hygienist was flossing the area to finish it, she said “Just have to floss this area… \*slight gasp\* the filling right next to it just popped out..” and I sighed.. lol. She said that she’ll get Dr. J to come drill the hole, which he did, and she finished the filling. I didn’t leave till about 10:30 am 😔

fast forward to a couple days ago to now. There’s a filling on my bottom left, prolly my “k-9” tooth I used to call it or the tooth behind it, and it’s hard to eat on that side because it hurts, but the filling was done last month. My cleaning is in November, but I’ll give this a week to get better before we make a big deal about it.

Edit: Today during school I had experienced very painful stings every time I would breathe through my mouth for my instrument, talk, or take drinks of something cold. The other day my toothpaste I used also felt like it burned where I got my most recent filling fixed. It’s never done that before, but I stopped using it. I have ANOTHER appointment on Monday 😒 and maybe we can get this resolved.",1,1757038089.0,legaladvice,1,1.0,False

It just feels so unfair. She had a hard life. She grew up in poverty, oldest of 5 kids, to teen parents. She was abused by her mom and grandmother as a child, then neglected for years. She was close to her father but he ended up an alcoholic who stole money from her and estranged himself from all his children until he was a few months away from dying himself. 

She married my father who hid his real self well. Once married, my father became an emotionally and financially abusive alcoholic that caused my mom so much pain and stress. She was stressed about money my entire life. My dad couldn’t hold a job, and took huge financial risks (starting business after business, spending insane amounts of money he didn’t have on hobbies) while my mom worked her ass off in a good career that my dad constantly downplayed and made her feel bad about. My mom’s friends all stopped talking to her because they hated my dad. My mom’s siblings started getting distant from her because they were envious of her career and they didn’t work or couldn’t work.

My older sister experienced a severe trauma outside of the home. That paired with watching my parents fight and carrying the weight of my dads alcoholism, my mom’s sadness and stress, and trying to help care for me and my other sibling pushed her into a bad place. She started using drugs at 15 years old and couldn’t stop. She died a drug related death after over ten years in addiction. My mom loved my sister dearly and her addiction destroyed my mom’s soul for those ten years. She didn’t sleep or eat, cried constantly. She tried 7 different therapists in that time. None helped. She would go find my sister in drug houses, scoop her up, bring her home, care for her and then beg my sister not to leave again, but my sister always would. My parents would seperate often during these years, but they ended up back together when my sister died. Mostly for my dad’s convenience. My mom would talk about regretting continuously caring for my dad because he never did deserve it - but she couldn’t stop.

4 months after my sister died, my moms mother died, and around this time, my moms mother in law was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. My mom was very close to her mother in law. Then a month after that, mom was diagnosed with cancer. 

During the first year of fighting cancer my mom fell into a deep depression and wanted to give up. My dad was drinking again, and stopped working again. Putting more stress on her once again. He started spending all her money once again. She became so depressed it was hard to be around. She had to retire from a career she loved and my brother and I were both living away at school. She spent her days watching tv and crying. Eventually, her treatment started to work and her depression lifted. 

My mom went into remission in 2020, then covid happened. Just as she was able to travel and see people and enjoy life again she was told to stay inside and hide from the world. 

As the pandemic eased up in Canada, my mom decided to start living her life. She took a few trips and reconnected with old friends. She started working again in a job she enjoyed. 

Then her cancer came back a few months before she was about to become a grandmother to my child. 

She fought again, and her treatment worked for a few months then stopped working. She took a break from treatment for a few months and her cancer came back with a vengeance. She nearly died 3 times in the summer of 2024. She was deemed palliative at this point. She lived one more year. She tried 3 types of chemo between November 2024 and her death this past August. None of them worked. Her cancer continued to grow. She started requiring oxygen and pain meds. She lost the ability to run, then play, then couldn’t even walk much. 

The last two months of my mom’s life, she welcomed her second grandchild. This broke her heart and mine. She hated knowing she wouldn’t watch my kids grow up. She spent a lot of time talking about her anger. Anger that she got ripped off. That she didn’t get enough good years. That my dad let her down time and time again. Anger that she worked so hard and knew she’d never reap the benefits. Anger that my dad would get her money after he abused her financially for decades. She was furious. I was furious for her. 

The unfairness of her fate clouded up those last few months. She was desperately fighting for more time, taking targeted therapy that was hurting her and causing awful side effects. She cried about losing her hair. She cried about being afraid of death. She was desperate for a miracle, for more time. To spend with friends and loved ones. To see her grandkids grow. She talked a lot about her sadness and grief in those last few months. There were no conversations about her childhood or happy memories - just her anger and grief. 

And then, she died. She woke up one morning with plans to see a friend in her home for coffee, and she must have felt all the pain and weakness and fatigue crashing into her at once. She had a normal day before that. But this time she kept saying “what am I gonna do?” “Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck” out loud as my dad and I tried to figure out what was wrong, what she needed. She never said anything besides those statements. “What am I gonna do?!” I hear it constantly. I believe she realized in that moment she was out of time and strength to go on, but still wasn’t ready for the end. She was in hospice the next day. She woke up a couple of times in hospice with this panicked, terrified look on her face. There was no beautiful final words or speeches. Just her sleeping, only to wake up with pure terror across her face until she fell back asleep again. And then her final breaths. Her heart pumped for 2 days after she lost consciousness. It was brutal and heartbreaking. 

A woman who gave herself to others her whole life. Always kind, always forgiving. A woman who endured so much suffering to have more time with family and friends. A woman who is now only remembered for being so special, so generous, so beautiful on the inside. 

She did not deserve everything that happened to her. She sure as fuck did not deserve to go out like that - terrified, in pain, angry. 

I don’t know why I typed all this out. I initially wanted to share that sometimes I’m doing better, but this is what came out. 

I am afraid I’ll be angry for the rest of my life for her. 

Mom, you deserved better. You deserved to be here. I’m so sorry. I love you.

1n8swe4,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowledgeFight/comments/1n8swe4/something_stinks_and_its_not_freshly_roasted/,Something stinks and it's not freshly roasted coffee.,"So, I was watching 2lazy2try's video breaking down the drama and Alex's reaction to Owen quitting/getting fired and I noticed something in Alex's eyes. They didn't look like the eyes of a truly angry man. Sure, he was going full tilt boogie and hamming it up for the camera, but something was off. He didn't look or sound drunk. He didn't fake cry even once. He looked, dare I say, polished. Professional, even. Then I remembered he's a professional propagandist and actor (he was nearly tapped to play Star Lord dontcha know) with 30 years of experience under his belt. 

This whole thing is an op. 

Why? The simplest explanation I can think of is that Infowars will hopefully be liquidated soon, money is tight, and Owen was chopping down six figures for some goddamn reason and had to be laid off. Drama sells. We're all talking about it. JorDan did a scrumptous 3 hour emergency broadcast. Left wing media is basking in the schadenfreude. They engineer a publicity stunt to get more eyeballs on the both of them, and maybe give Owen some much-needed juice to strike out on his own. He has a fighting chance now. Owen gets to look like the principled, reasonable young conservative and Alex dutifully goes down defending King Trump against the Derp State. It's better for Owen to leave now while they still have the platform to do this ploy. 

Maybe Alex is putting the pieces in place to bow out cleanly for a while after liquidation. Similar to Michael Jordan's ""retirement"" after the '93 season. The Owen Report and WIN Network could be the way back for Alex after IW is dead and gone, politically. Owen and Alex bury the hatchet, bro-hug it out, and hop back into the Millennium Falcon once again after Alex takes a little breakie. Maybe he'll finally take his daughter fishing, but I doubt it.

bit of a different post but i've recently upgraded from this:

[Timestamp](https://ibb.co/dwRMq09T). This Saeco Odea GO was recently descaled, it's in good working order, steams milk well. The only thing is it's missing the grinder key but you can find 3d files on thingiverse, i just never got around to it.

this was my first machine that got me into coffee and nobody i know wanted it so i figured i would post it here. 

i really just want this machine to go to someone who will use it, i'd like to trade this for whatever bag of specialty coffee from a roaster you love.

i'm trying to keep this local as i don't think its worth it to ship anywhere and its always nice to meet local people who love coffee.

1n8snix,https://www.reddit.com/r/Phentermine_/comments/1n8snix/my_experience/,My experience,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my experience after I came to Reddit for others experiences. I’m 31. Was food obsessed it’s all I thought of. I asked for phentermine since my family members recalled it being helpful for them. I waited a month to go through the process. 

So I took it for a month. 1/2 tab of 37.5mg. Every morning. Hours after my phone appointment I was sitting and my heart wouldn’t stop beating so hard and fast. Never in my life have I felt this. I went to lay down, on my way to the floor I grabbed my Apple Watch. My BPM was 165. I thought ok maybe it’s because I had a coffee? I was advised some can and can’t handle it. I waited a few days to test it out and I felt normal. 

30 mins of laying there I got up and told myself ok I clearly cannot continue caffeine. That evening on my way back home from filling my Phentermine I am driving and my hand is cold and clamy my left foot is tingling and I cannot swallow I feel like I’m halfway being choked. I try to calm myself cause that is aiding into my heart as well. I decided I cannot take this medication any longer. 

Saturday and Sunday no heart palpitations. I randomly took magnesium Saturday morning. 

Monday, I’m on my way to my daughter’s class. I feel the sensation again I can’t explain it but it’s like a flood of feeling in my chest and neck. My heart is beating faster but I am walking around. I finish with my daughter’s class and I’m on my way home. My heart is racing as I’m driving I’m at 127 BPM. Just sitting in my car. 

I blow cold AC in my face and calm myself . I make it home and lay in the floor. My husband comes out so happy and he sees me on the floor and asks what is wrong. I tell him I have to talk slow because I can’t breathe and I think I need to go to the hospital (I did not want to admit to myself how bad this was) I was on the floor at 140bpm and it stayed there for 10 mins. Eventually it goes away.


3 hours later again but at 127 bpm .

I feel fine after.


Tuesday. It’s 5pm and I feel my jaw lock out of nowhere then my heart starts again. I go lay down ice pack but it’s not stopping. Now my neck and my back hurt out of nowhere. It goes away. I couldn’t sleep all night cause I couldn’t breathe. 

I wake up Wednesday morning and I can’t even get my daughter ready for school. Out of breath and my neck and jaw are hurting again. I tell my husband I need to go it’s not getting better like I thought. He drives me and I walk into ER and thank God no line. I stand there and wait and my BPM is now 155. They get me in they look worried I finally cry cause I had to be strong this whole time to not worry my family. The EKG reports a part of my heart is not doing what it should. They run every test and it comes back I’m low on magnesium and phosphorus. Im wearing a heart monitor and Thank you God I have not had to press the button 🥹. 

I feel normal again. 

To add I was recently told I’m anemic back when I was referred to Weight Management. 

I understand a lot of what I went through was my caffeine and not eating correctly cause I was hardly hungry at all. As well as anemia. 

I just wanted to share my experience. 

The Dr said my heart could be damaged we will find out. As of now I am totally normal feeling and I’m so happy. I thought I was going to die. ",1,1757037004.0,Phentermine_,0,1.0,False

I’m worried I’m ruining my life for something that will never come. AIO?","Is my [32F] relationship with my boyfriend [38M] how it really is supposed to be?

I started dating my boyfriend in October 2024. About 2 weeks into semi regularly seeing him, I attempted to cuddle with him on the couch. He stopped me and said “what are you doing? We’ve only known each other 2 weeks”… I was really taken back but maybe he’s right?


To give context on where I’m at in this now, fast forward 10 months, he doesn’t cuddle, rarely initiates sex, lets me give him blowjobs then doesn’t do anything for me, when he first started fucking me, it felt magical. He was insanely good. He took his time with me, dirty talked me. Now I feel like a masturbation sleeve. No post sex cuddles. No post sex talking even. He just turns on the tv and rolls over to go to sleep eventually. Not a goodnight. It took him 8 months to say I love you, I cracked and said it first during a fight. We hardly kiss, and if we do it’s just a little peck. we used to make out. Now that he has me, he doesn’t want to kiss me. Everything that goes wrong is my fault, I’m too sensitive, “my feelings are my own problem to deal with”, I need too much, wanting affection is “hallmark 7th grade bullshit, he’s a man”


Anyways,


Here are some key moments that I can’t choke down and don’t know if I’m over reacting or not. 


I had 2 cats, 5 and 7 years old. With me since babies. My whole heart. He knew they existed. But then 4 months into dating, he said he’s highly allergic to cats, can barely breathe, etc. 
He still let them come to the house for a trial period. It went horribly. There’s no doubt he’s allergic to cats. I tried everything, hepa, food changed, bathes, deep cleaning, didn’t matter. 

He said if I want to make this work they have to be rehomed. 
I am 32, desperate to get married and have a family. He said he’s slow to open up, would become more affectionate with time, would never hurt me, when he loves he loves hard, it’s just slower for him. 

I lost my tenancy at my house. I couldn’t afford anything else on the rental market, and he kept telling me the relationship felt stagnant and idle until I move in. 
I felt backed against a corner. I had to give away my cats. They’ve been rehomed twice. They didn’t work out at the first place. I want to kill myself. I miss them so much. I feel like I made such a big mistake.  He offered me no support during this. When I’d cry about them he would get mad and storm out. He never held me through it, never said it’s going to be okay, this is for our future, nothing reassuring. I am still grieving them like it happened yesterday. It’s been 2 months. I cry in private all the time, im scared for him to see me cry because of how he reacts. He has never asked how I’m doing. 

I moved in, and I had to throw nearly everything I own out. All I have is my bed and my clothes. My decade of building up is gone. He had no room for my stuff. He’s a minimalist. I can have one coffee cup, etc. 
When I had to throw everything out manually myself, he was never around. He was out working out, at his shop dicking around, etc. I had to actually ask him to come help me, and then he’d just show up and start shoving everything into garbage bags, not asking me or working with me, just treating my stuff like it’s all garbage. And then get pissed off when I’d say “hey wait that thing is really important to me”

When I have emotions he loses it on me. He’s called me a lazy bitch for letting dishes and laundry pile for 3 days right after I gave my cats away and was grieving and in distress. He’s called me a cunt, told me to shut the fuck up. I’m immature. A real woman would hold shit down, Get a grip, he’s thrown things at walls, walked out on me and slammed doors, whipped his iPad at me after asking for help fixing an issue with it, etc. the only way this doesn’t happen, is if I keep my mouth shut, do what needs to be done, don’t ask for affection and connection, and just be there for him. 

Once I moved in, he invested a substantial amount of money into me, 12.5k, to get corrective surgery on a ton of loose skin I had from weight loss. I didn’t ask him to help me. He just did and said I don’t need to pay him back. Now I feel stuck. I took the offer because I felt like I’d just given up everything, yes please make an investment back into me. 

I had surgery and was supposed to be very low activity for 4-6 weeks

I didn’t do dishes or sweep or laundry for a few days and he had a meltdown over the state the house was becoming. I started doing all the chores again (I cook every single night from scratch, clean, dishes, sweep, mop, changed out garbages, laundry, wash and fold. He says he’s responsible for outside, fixing, taking garbage to dump)

I started doing all the chores again, and I had several complications where I needed to emergency meet with my surgeon twice because of over strain. I was scared of making him mad, and he wasn’t helping at all or offering. 
After the second wound opening, he said “don’t lift a finger. I’ll be the muscles”. Well guess what? There’s been laundry baskets sitting unfolded for 5 days, we’re sleeping in a mattress cover because he won’t put the sheet on (I’m scared to move my arms like that) the dishes pile up, and I’m still cooking dinner and dishes and sweeping and mopping.  

But now the surgery is over, my cats are gone, my heart is broken, my stuff is in the landfill, I am… a shell of the person I was when I first met him. 

I don’t get affection. He winces when I try to kiss him or get close with him. He keeps everting surface level. He won’t tell me about his past. He won’t ask about mine and said he doesn’t want to know.
Everything is surface level
I am lonely. I’m so lonely. But I keep gaslighting myself, like he spent so much money on me that he didn’t necessarily have to just throw around, he’s trying to show love I guess? But I’m so fucking empty. I want him so bad. I want all of him and for him to want all of me. I’m so empty. 

Am I hallmark? Am I too needy? Am I expecting too much? He has said “I’m a grown fucking man” a few times when I bid for connection. He said what he looks for in a a woman is someone who’s sweet, calm, loving, supportive. 

I am all of those things, but when you want a woman like that, she’s going to be affectionate and starve for some connection. That’s part of what makes her sweet and supportive. 

I constantly just want to go beg for my cats back and move into my parents. But I keep holding this hope he will snap out and love me more. Am I wanting too much from a grown “real” man?

I just finished this that I started back in early spring from the stock Midnight Special 2x12.

I call it ""The Golden $hower"".

I wanted to do a nice looking and reliable bike for ocational commuting, coffee rides and just chilling on not so sporty rides.

Main focus was keeping the Gold + Brown theme and all reliable parts, getting away from carbon as much as possible.

I am liking several things on the build, but main ones are:

- There and back rack from Velo Orange.
- Utility rack added to the rack also from Velo Orange.
- FSA pro-wing agx handlebar
- Easton EA70AX 650b wheelset (reliable, decent looking and easy to set)
- Panaracer Gravelking Slick 650b x 48 (running tubeless, very comfortable and have saved me so much time dealing with staples and goat heads)
- Titanium screws everywhere with brownish anodized, they just look sick.

It has been doing its duty as intended, especially the utility rack to carry the lunch box without affecting much the center of gravity (same reason I stayed away from a rear basket after trying it).

I hope this helps to other looking for ideas or component references.

I broke up with my significant other a month ago due to his heavy involvement in weed, alcohol, social media, cheating, and hanging out with other people behind my back. This all happened while I was out of town for a funeral, and when I came back, I decided to end things.

Since then, we’ve been in no contact and haven’t seen each other. But now, a month later, he seems to be making changes: no alcohol, a consistent sleep schedule, deleted social media, mostly just goes to work and home, and even cut down his weed intake (which is huge because he’s been smoking daily for over 10 years). He even stopped drinking coffee.

Part of me feels happy he’s getting himself together, but also sad because he didn’t do this when we were together. The thing is, he’s still unmedicated and not in therapy. So, I’m wondering could this really be a lasting lifestyle change, or is it likely he’ll slip back into the same cycle without medical help? He’s not medicated ! 

I think what also bothers me is that while we were together, I was trying to support him in making these changes, and we were in what I thought was a loving relationship. But now, after the breakup, it feels like he’s suddenly able to live this super disciplined lifestyle, almost like I was somehow part of the reason he couldn’t do it before. It leaves me questioning if the timing of his “turnaround” is real growth, or just another phase.

Has anyone else been through something like this? Did the changes last, or did your partner eventually fall back into old patterns?

Before I continue I want to make it clear that **I make no money from this and have no affiliations, it is a hobby project**. With that said, I run the website https://www.onthegrind.com.au/.

On The Grind is a daily-updated website that scans a curated list of coffee roasters from across the country. It then neatly groups them up per roaster and gives some basic filtering, and ta da, effectively an up-to-date database of all things coffee. That's all there is to it. You still buy direct from the roaster, and all I do is provide a central place for you to easily find what you want.

For the coffee people out there, we filter mostly for single origins with some exceptions (Raspberry Candy from Ona Coffee for example, iykyk). Processing method is a filter, and Decaf is unreliable but present - depends on the website's listing information we can access.

As a final point, it was made for passion and is totally not perfect, especially on mobile. I ain't a UX designer so I've done what I can, but there's a limit. We're also ultimately dependent on the roasters' websites so if, for example, they haven't removed a product out of stock we can't always immediately tell. I hope some of you make use out of it, me and my mates who I made it for use it literally every single week. Cheers!

Bradenton.  Yet, you must understand:  Yes, 75 minutes by car yet 75 million light years away.

Since coming to Tampa I enjoy giving my self mild anxiety by slowly zooming out in Google Maps and just... sprawl, sprawl, sprawl.... 

All 9 months I've been sober (just lost the vehicle due to work so I've had pleasure, doing pool care, to drive all over this city) and I've been all over Hillsborough:

1 month Plant City.
1 month Hyde Park.
6 months Seminole Heights.
... Just got my own place in TEMPLE TERRACE!

Another thing that's foreign to me.  In Manatee County we had ONE CITY and if you drove 15 mins to the left, water.  15 mins to the right and besides LWR just barren land all the way to Port Saint Lucie.

Tampa?  OK, I can drive for an hour to the west... and still just be in the middle of concrete.  Drive an hour to the east?  Sprawl sprawl sprawl all the way past Brandon.  North?  Start seeing trees around Lutz.

South?  I'd have sprawl all the til Gibsonton and then civilization ends.

For some reason this really bothers me.  My entire life there's been clear cut boundaries on civilization, the idea of a city, and just... natural borders.  Its weird to me.

Also, Tampa is dirty as heck.  How many beauty supply stores are there?!  Why are racial tensions really good?!  In Bradenton it's all white people and then a magic line turns into not,

In Tampa I am often the minority anywhere north of SR60.  Why does it FEEL dirty?!  Bradenton and Sarasota was is vibrant greens and water grass...  not alot of nice yards.  Also, hardly anyone has astroturf in Manatee.

That Astroturf urks me, is horrible for the environment and if you have a pool and you get astroturf prepare for run off.  A large majority of houses that got Astrod theres now these holes and staining and pool is filthy... not good.

OK and why... How am I... Why is Temple Terrace the Vatican of Tampa?  I am, hold on let me look out the window... 4 houses to tne west and the street lights change and the garbage cans say CITY OF TAMPA... but Tampa extends into and around all of TT!

A city within a city makes no sense.  Tons of Muslims!  Which is interesting.  Me and my friend do Bible Study now at the Quarina Coffee place (SO GOOD) and we have this really cool like open discussion outside and often before we know it there's 6 Muslims around us yet all in a healthy communicating way.

Why do Muslims love Hookahs?  Also, a Muslim from India is much different in culture and appearance than a Muslim from Gaza - yet the draw to Temple Terrace isn't the ethnicity but the beliefs so its cool to see three ethnicity speaking broken English as all 3 are from different countries yet mesh from their religion.

Why does Bradenton have 5 Walmarts and I have to drive an hour to get to one in Tampa?

Is it cool to say Temple Terrace or should I keep saying I ""live in Tampa""

Because I don't feel like I live in Tampa.  Sure, Tampa Palms and University say Tampa but it's a world away.

This small town boy went to Chic Fil A on Fowler and I had to make u turns and cut across 6 lines of traffic multiple times the roads go on FOREVER... There's never, as in Bradenton... Oh, XYZ?  Turn right, enter, exit, turn left.

Tampa?!?!?  Left.  No Uturn.  3 turning lanes.  Furthest one.  No U turn.  Right turn only.  Wait, is this a turn?  Fudge what does blinking red mean again, OK and three Hail Mary's lets make a left turn!

Why did you guys ruin your beautiful river its so sad now.

I really like Armature works.

My entire life I've dreamed of living in Tampa and its sort of.... a never ending suburb.  But I like it!

The most beautiful women in the world on thst Bayshore every morning!  Good Lord Tampa has beautiful women!

1n8se78,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1n8se78/how_to_let_go/,How to let go??,"Basically, I recently broke up with my ex because I felt like he wasn’t treating me the best. He wasn’t a bad boyfriend but he lacked effort and he didn’t really prioritize me that much. Before we dated we were best friends and we had amazing chemistry so we decided to date. 

After dating him for a couple months I realized that there were a lot of things I didn’t really like about our relationship but I ignored it because I thought it would go away with time. It didn’t. 

I eventually communicated and things didn’t change and I felt like I was asking for the bare minimum. Things like asking him to make time for me and asking him to respond to me were what I complained about. I know I am an anxiously attached person but he would straight up not respond for hours on end. I understand if he has other things to do but I asked that he would atleast give me a heads up so I’m not wondering what he’s up to. A big reason why I didn’t communicate was because I blamed myself. I thought I was too clingy or dependent on him but I realized I was never gonna feel at peace in the relationship if he didn’t change. And I didn’t think I was asking for too much. 

On top of this, we were going long distance so it would only get worse and we were also dealing with a lot of family problems. So, I made the decision to end it with him because it felt like the relationship was doing more harm than good. I still love him very much and I miss him so much. I also feel like I made a mistake by breaking up with him because he could’ve changed but I didn’t give him the time to.

Now he’s moved to a new city and attends a party school so I’m sure he’s moved on quickly. Before he left he asked me if it was okay if we were to grab coffee when he comes back to my city. I said yes but now I’m rethinking about it because it’s making me hold onto him. I feel like I can’t move on because I know I’m going to see him again and feel like I should still be staying loyal to him incase he comes back and we rekindle our relationship. 

I’m not sure how to let go in this situation because I’m holding onto the hope we’ll be together once he comes back. ",1,1757036260.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Hope you’re all doing great wherever you are 🌍

I know this might sound a bit crazy… but have you ever thought about “backpacking on a budget and living slow”? I’ve dreamed of it so many times, and now I’ve finally decided to do it.

I’m looking for someone with the same nomad-vibe mind like me who might want to join this wild ride. 

Even if not, I’d love to hear your suggestions-  what to carry, quick food hacks, camping tips, or even just meet for a coffee if our paths cross.

I’m from The Nilgiris, TN, India. I’ll be starting my journey on Oct 20 and going till Dec 2025, beginning in Varanasi and slowly moving north into Nepal and the Himalayas.

The vibe is simple: hitchhiking, slow life, spiritual flow, nomadic living, cooking my own food, tent life, and all on a tight budget.

If this feels like your kind of madness, and you’ve got the same nomad vibe, drop a comment or DM me :)",2,1757036217.0,backpacking,0,1.0,False

1n8sauh,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1n8sauh/i_32f_feel_like_my_partner_38m_might_be_a/,I [32F] feel like my partner [38M] might be a narcissist or has something that will stop him from ever having real intimate connection,"Is my [32F] relationship with my boyfriend [38M] how it really is supposed to be?

I started dating my boyfriend in October 2024. About 2 weeks into semi regularly seeing him, I attempted to cuddle with him on the couch. He stopped me and said “what are you doing? We’ve only known each other 2 weeks”… I was really taken back but maybe he’s right?


To give context on where I’m at in this now, fast forward 10 months, he doesn’t cuddle, rarely initiates sex, lets me give him blowjobs then doesn’t do anything for me, when he first started fucking me, it felt magical. He was insanely good. He took his time with me, dirty talked me. Now I feel like a masturbation sleeve. No post sex cuddles. No post sex talking even. He just turns on the tv and rolls over to go to sleep eventually. Not a goodnight. It took him 8 months to say I love you, I cracked and said it first during a fight. We hardly kiss, and if we do it’s just a little peck. we used to make out. Now that he has me, he doesn’t want to kiss me. Everything that goes wrong is my fault, I’m too sensitive, “my feelings are my own problem to deal with”, I need too much, wanting affection is “hallmark 7th grade bullshit, he’s a man”


Anyways,


Here are some key moments that I can’t choke down and don’t know if I’m over reacting or not. 


I had 2 cats, 5 and 7 years old. With me since babies. My whole heart. He knew they existed. But then 4 months into dating, he said he’s highly allergic to cats, can barely breathe, etc. 
He still let them come to the house for a trial period. It went horribly. There’s no doubt he’s allergic to cats. I tried everything, hepa, food changed, bathes, deep cleaning, didn’t matter. 

He said if I want to make this work they have to be rehomed. 
I am 32, desperate to get married and have a family. He said he’s slow to open up, would become more affectionate with time, would never hurt me, when he loves he loves hard, it’s just slower for him. 

I lost my tenancy at my house. I couldn’t afford anything else on the rental market, and he kept telling me the relationship felt stagnant and idle until I move in. 
I felt backed against a corner. I had to give away my cats. They’ve been rehomed twice. They didn’t work out at the first place. I want to kill myself. I miss them so much. I feel like I made such a big mistake.  He offered me no support during this. When I’d cry about them he would get mad and storm out. He never held me through it, never said it’s going to be okay, this is for our future, nothing reassuring. I am still grieving them like it happened yesterday. It’s been 2 months. I cry in private all the time, im scared for him to see me cry because of how he reacts. He has never asked how I’m doing. 

I moved in, and I had to throw nearly everything I own out. All I have is my bed and my clothes. My decade of building up is gone. He had no room for my stuff. He’s a minimalist. I can have one coffee cup, etc. 
When I had to throw everything out manually myself, he was never around. He was out working out, at his shop dicking around, etc. I had to actually ask him to come help me, and then he’d just show up and start shoving everything into garbage bags, not asking me or working with me, just treating my stuff like it’s all garbage. And then get pissed off when I’d say “hey wait that thing is really important to me”

When I have emotions he loses it on me. He’s called me a lazy bitch for letting dishes and laundry pile for 3 days right after I gave my cats away and was grieving and in distress. He’s called me a cunt, told me to shut the fuck up. I’m immature. A real woman would hold shit down, Get a grip, he’s thrown things at walls, walked out on me and slammed doors, whipped his iPad at me after asking for help fixing an issue with it, etc. the only way this doesn’t happen, is if I keep my mouth shut, do what needs to be done, don’t ask for affection and connection, and just be there for him. 

Once I moved in, he invested a substantial amount of money into me, 12.5k, to get corrective surgery on a ton of loose skin I had from weight loss. I didn’t ask him to help me. He just did and said I don’t need to pay him back. Now I feel stuck. I took the offer because I felt like I’d just given up everything, yes please make an investment back into me. 

I had surgery and was supposed to be very low activity for 4-6 weeks

I didn’t do dishes or sweep or laundry for a few days and he had a meltdown over the state the house was becoming. I started doing all the chores again (I cook every single night from scratch, clean, dishes, sweep, mop, changed out garbages, laundry, wash and fold. He says he’s responsible for outside, fixing, taking garbage to dump)

I started doing all the chores again, and I had several complications where I needed to emergency meet with my surgeon twice because of over strain. I was scared of making him mad, and he wasn’t helping at all or offering. 
After the second wound opening, he said “don’t lift a finger. I’ll be the muscles”. Well guess what? There’s been laundry baskets sitting unfolded for 5 days, we’re sleeping in a mattress cover because he won’t put the sheet on (I’m scared to move my arms like that) the dishes pile up, and I’m still cooking dinner and dishes and sweeping and mopping.  

But now the surgery is over, my cats are gone, my heart is broken, my stuff is in the landfill, I am… a shell of the person I was when I first met him. 

I don’t get affection. He winces when I try to kiss him or get close with him. He keeps everting surface level. He won’t tell me about his past. He won’t ask about mine and said he doesn’t want to know.
Everything is surface level
I am lonely. I’m so lonely. But I keep gaslighting myself, like he spent so much money on me that he didn’t necessarily have to just throw around, he’s trying to show love I guess? But I’m so fucking empty. I want him so bad. I want all of him and for him to want all of me. I’m so empty. 

Am I hallmark? Am I too needy? Am I expecting too much? He has said “I’m a grown fucking man” a few times when I bid for connection. He said what he looks for in a a woman is someone who’s sweet, calm, loving, supportive. 

I am all of those things, but when you want a woman like that, she’s going to be affectionate and starve for some connection. That’s part of what makes her sweet and supportive. 

I constantly just want to go beg for my cats back and move into my parents. But I keep holding this hope he will snap out and love me more. Am I wanting too much from a grown “real” man?

The last bit of context is that his mom disowned him at 13 and he never knew his dad. ",1,1757035975.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False

Suspecting you might have CTE can feel frightening and confusing. Headlines focus on the worst case stories, and it’s easy to feel like there’s nothing you can do. The truth is more complex.

There are steps you can take to protect your brain and your well-being.

•	**CTE progression varies.** Some people decline quickly, but many live for years or decades with manageable symptoms. Lifestyle, mental health care, social support, and ongoing medical management all make a difference.


•	**Your brain can adapt.** Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt and compensate for injury, helping maintain function even after damage.


•	**Treatment is management, not cure.** While there is currently no way to reverse CTE, medications, therapy, mindfulness, and structured routines can ease depression, anxiety, and executive dysfunction.


•	**Connection is protective.** Isolation worsens symptoms, while strong social support from family, friends, or support groups helps maintain stability and resilience.


Living with CTE is challenging but it isn’t the end of your story. Stability, joy, and meaning are still possible. Seeking knowledge and connection is already a powerful step forward.

⸻


**What You Can Do Tonight**

If you’re struggling, these evidence-based steps can help protect brain health and improve daily function:

•	**Prioritize sleep** — keep a consistent bedtime and practice good sleep hygiene

•	**Avoid alcohol and recreational drugs** — they worsen symptoms and brain health

•	**Eat a balanced diet** — focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods

•	**Move your body** — even light exercise or stretching improves circulation and brain function

•	**Maintain a simple routine** — structure reduces stress and supports memory

•	**Stay connected** — reach out to someone you trust; isolation makes things feel worse


These steps aren’t cures, but they give your brain a better chance to function tomorrow.

⸻


**What You Can Focus on Long Term**

Living with CTE means playing the long game. Consistency and support make a real difference. Key areas to prioritize include:

•	**Medical care** — learn to become your own health advocate. Find doctors and specialists who understand brain injury and the effects of repetitive head trauma

•	**Mental health management** — therapy, counseling, support groups, and medication if needed

•	**Physical health** — regular exercise, cardiovascular health, blood pressure control, and avoiding further head injuries

•	**Brain health habits** — lifelong learning, cognitive exercises, creative projects, and engaging hobbies

•	**Social connection** — nurture your support system; social isolation accelerates decline

•	**Purpose and meaning** — volunteering, mentoring, creative work, or community involvement can improve quality of life

•	**Planning ahead** — financial, legal, and family planning reduces future stress

•	**Supporting brain oxygenation** — aerobic exercise, a heart-healthy diet rich in iron and omega-3s, proper hydration, and, in some cases, therapies like hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT)

•	**Protecting your brain with antioxidants** — *oxidative stress can worsen injury;* **include:**

     • Anthocyanins: blueberries, blackberries, cherries, purple potatoes and grapes, red cabbage

     • Vitamin C and E: citrus, peppers, nuts, seeds, green leafy vegetables

     • Polyphenols: dark chocolate, green tea, coffee, turmeric

     • Other nutrients: omega-3 fatty acids, coenzyme Q10, flavonoids, and lion’s mane mushrooms may support brain health


Long term management doesn’t cure CTE, but it builds stability and quality of life. What you do every day matters.

1n8s6us,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrevilleCoffee/comments/1n8s6us/warranty_experience_touch_impress/,Warranty Experience - Touch Impress,"Having a pretty crappy time getting my unit fixed under the Breville warranty—sounds like my experience isn’t unique.  

The steam wand on my Touch Impress quit working. Sometimes it will start in manual mode, but this is a seldom occurrence.  It always shuts off early when it manages to turn on. Steam shoots out the bottom of the machine too. Multiple descales, cleanings of the wand, maintenance, etc. I realized the machine was still under warranty so I reached out to Breville. This experience has left me annoyed for the following reasons:


(1) Getting into contact with Breville is a chore.  

Their online chat agents are always offline.  They don’t respond to comments in an online case.  And, their automated phone system is always dealing with “unexpected” technological issues that require you to wait for a call back—which takes forever.   I tried sitting on hold for a long time and no luck.  

When they call back, it’s usually at a super inconvenient time and unreasonably early.  


(2) The shipping sounded (and was) deceptively simple. 

Breville gave me a UPS label and instructions on how to package the item.  I thought that the poor initial communication was maybe a fluke and was relieved to get this going.  Breville told me they’d be sending me packaging to use to ship the item to them.  A week and a half go by and no packing arrives.  

Flashback to item 1 above.  I go through the hassle of getting into contact with Breville, which takes a couple days, and they realize they did something wrong on their side and ship the package.  A few more days go by and I finally get the package.  

I am deep into espresso withdrawals at this point. Bright side (I guess) is that I am making new friends at Starbucks. Also starting to enjoy half day old coffee from my drip machine—sometimes I reheat it. 


(3) No communications during repair process. 

My machine goes into a void.  I have no clue where it is or what’s going on.  I try to ask Breville via their online mediums. Those communications also go into the aforementioned void.  See also: (1) above.  I don’t have the patience to call again, so I just trust something is happening somewhere.  

Some more time goes by and I get an email showing a stock photo of my machine with a UPS tracking label.  I’m pretty stoked.  I check the tracking website religiously, mainly out of boredom, but also because I really miss my espresso.  The machine finally arrives.  Again, stoked. No details regarding the repair, but there is a new burr grinder piece-not sure why. I thought maybe that was a nice touch.  

In any event, I quickly unpack it, plug the machine in, it was factory reset so I go through all that again, and then try to make a 3pm flat white.  Try…


(4) Repair quality. 

The machine is kind of dirty, but whatever.  The espresso grinds at a much different setting than usual, eh-whatever.  Noticing a few different icons as I work through the screens.  Firmware update? Whatever.  Now comes the time to steam my dairy.  I’m jazzed. 

Nothing happens.  

Same problem.  

I’m sad. Borderline devastated (not really).  But, honestly really annoyed.  

So, I try to chat Breville.  That doesn’t work.  I leave a comment in my ticket (the void).  I call, more “unexpected” technological issues.  See (1) above.  

So, now I am sitting, waiting, wishing for my 6am phone call from Breville and warm milk.  


——

Really a horrible experience.  I just want my coffee.  I will not be purchasing another Breville product based on this experience.  

Not really sure why I made this post. I guess I’m seeking empathy, sympathy, or just some shared remorse or a tip/hint on getting this resolved.

While this story can be read on its own, you'll get a lot more out of it if you read its predecessor.

# Chapter 1:

# Pointless

Death stared at her through the mirror.

Or at least, that’s what she felt like anyways.

Jane Arkensaw never felt good after waking up in the mornings. Not recently that is. Not since she’d been noticed by the demon that stalks the shadows of this town. Not since her dreams had all but turned to vicious nightmares. Not since her mind had been invaded.

But none of that mattered. Sure, it certainly mattered to Jane. But it hardly felt like her opinion was of importance to anyone other than herself. Outside of her therapist, it felt like nobody cared that Jane walked around like a zombie each and everyday. Not her teachers, not the kids at school, not the guidance counselor. Nobody. Her father might have cared, if Jane ever told him how she was really feeling inside. But the consequences that came with that decision almost outweighed the benefits.

And so, Jane pretended that she was fine. She woke up every day and slathered her sagging eyes with makeup, sprayed on perfume to hide the unshowered scent of her body, and faced every day with a mask.

Faced everyday hiding it.

Faced everyday faking it.

Jane gave a deep sigh as she stared deep into her own tired face. She just wanted to go back to bed. Or maybe just keep staring at herself. Keep staring deep into the ocean blue eyes upon her face. One of the few features of her body she really liked. Everyone said they were her mother’s eyes. And Jane liked that. Like an heirloom that was passed down.

She would’ve stayed holed up in the bathroom forever if she could. But a shout from down the hall broke her from her thoughts.

“Janie! Up and at ‘em! Its 7:15, gotta get moving soon!” Her father shouted across the house. Jane sighed through her nose again and started going about her morning routine. Or at least, deciding what parts of it she cared enough to do.

Use the bathroom? Yes.

Shower? She didn’t have time. At least that was the argument she gave herself. But deep down she knew the real reason why. It was the same reason why she didn’t shower last night. Or the night before that. She would shower tonight. For sure.

Probably.

Brush teeth? Jane debated it. And ultimately decided she could skip today. She didn’t have the energy or motivation to bother. She’d just chew some gum later. It’d be fine. She brushed her teeth yesterday actually. So she considered that being ahead of the game.

Make up? Today it would be needed, unfortunately. Jane had an appointment with the therapist later and knew that if she showed up with such deep bags under her eyes she’d get chewed out. So she slathered her face with the thick, creamy foundation. Spreading it around with her spongy brush until it hid the bruise like bags beneath her eyes.

Brush hair? Jane considered her messy locks in the mirror. The strands falling unevenly down to her mid-back. It was frizzy, uneven, and generally just in need of a trim. Jane knew her hair would look a million times better if she took even slightly more care of it. But she never did. Instead of brushing it, Jane decided it would just be easier to tie it back into a bun. Though several strands still hung loosely around her face. Like vines upon a condemned building.

Jane exited the bathroom and slipped quietly into her room. She could hear her dad in the kitchen making breakfast. She hadn’t decided if she was going to eat yet today. Maybe she would. Just to make her dad happy.

Get dressed? Obviously. Though Jane wished on many occasions that she could just wear her pajamas to school. She would if she could. That was one of the things she was looking forward to most about college, actually. She heard that nobody really cared if you came to class in your pajamas. Or in dirty old sweats. That sounded like heaven to Jane.

But unfortunately for her, Mandeville High School was a lot more strict than a college was. So Jane threw on a pair of torn up jeans, a *Motionless in White* band tee, and then a black zip up jacket over the top. She’d had the jacket for years. And worn it so frequently that the old green alien face on the back had all but faded away.

Jane had newer jackets. Gifts from relatives and such for Christmas or birthdays. But none of them were from her mom.

This one was.

So, it was the one she kept. Simple.

Jane finished off her outfit by stuffing her feet into her worn out high top shoes. Tie them? No point. They always came undone anyways. So instead she just stuffed them down the sides.

Jane grabbed her backpack and cellophone before shuffling out of her room and down the hall to the kitchen. Her slow, undead shuffling made the walk through their tiny house seem far longer than it normally would have.

“Good morning, Janie!” Mr. Arkensaw chirped happily as Jane stepped into the kitchen. He tossed a glance over his shoulder, his own black curls bouncing with the movement. “Sleep good?” He asked as he returned to his cooking of breakfast.

“I slept fine.” Jane lied as shewatched her father go about the task of preparing breakfast. She bristled at it. “I can help, you know.” She insisted as sheslumped into a seat at the kitchen table.

“Well, I know you can Janie. But you were still getting ready. If I waited on you we’d not have anything to eat this morning. Plus, its not like I can’t handle it on my own.”

“Whatever.” Jane grumbled. Her father knew she liked to help. Needed to help. And yet still insisted on doing so much all by himself. It irked her to no end. “Can I have some coffee then?”

“Pots already made. I’m whipping up some quick bacon if you want some.” Mr. Arkensaw glanced at the time and bit his lip. “Probably shouldn’t have…. Not with the time. But how could I resist? You know what I always say about breakfast!”

Jane pushed herself up from the table and grabbed the handle of the coffee pot, but soon found her father’s hand over her own.

“Oh, here Janie. Let me do it.” He slid his hand down and took the pot from Jane, pouring her a cup himself. “Wouldn’t want you to get burned again.” He smiled kindly and handed her the mug. “Be careful. Its-”

“Hot. I know. Thanks.” Jane struggled not to roll her eyes as she took the drink. Sipping it as she returned to her seat. All it took was a small burn, one time, for Jane’s father to become convinced that she was incapable of pouring her own coffee. As with everything, she knew it came from a place of love. But that didn’t stop it from being annoying.

Jane absently sipped at her coffee while staring out the window. Her dad was speaking to her but she wasn’t paying attention. Her eyes were fixated on the man in the woods. The tall figure that always stood just on the edge of her vision. Watching her. Tormenting her. Enticing her. She squeezed her eyes shut as the static buzzed in her brain. Her head feeling like it was about to pop like an overfilled balloon. She felt a drop of warm blood leak from her nose. She hurriedly wiped it away before her dad could see and make a fuss over it.

“Don’t forget about your visit with the therapist today, honey.” Her father reminded her as he took his seat opposite from her at the table.

“I know dad. You don’t need to remind me.” Jane mumbled as she lifted her cup to her mouth. She sucked down the bitter coffee, trying to wash the metallic twang of blood that seemed to haunt the back of her throat.

“Are you sure you want to keep seeing this therapist? I could take you somewhere else. Its no problem at all Janie, really-”

“No. I like Ms. Crosby.” Jane shook her head and interrupted her father. “I don’t want to speak to some stranger. It took me long enough to get used to her. Let alone some one new.”

“I know…. But are you sure a regular therapist is really qualified for this? Your mental health….” Her father trailed off. The topic was a sore one. He always worried about Jane. To an unhealthy degree. Mr. Arkensaw was always an anxious person, but after the death of his wife and son, his worry for Jane only increased 10 fold.

“Its fine dad. Qualifications don’t matter. All that matters is how good the person can do their job.” Jane and her father had this discussion too many times to count. But the fact of the matter was simple. Jane didn’t want to see anyone else. No matter how many degrees someone had, there were just some things that couldn’t be learned in school. Her father, ultimately, accepted her decision. But it didn’t stop him from trying to persuade her otherwise.

Jane knew her father was just trying to make her happy. And at the same time, Jane was just trying to make her father happy in return.

“Alright…. I just hope its working is all.” Mr. Arkensaw looked up at the cat shaped clock on the wall above them. “Better get moving.” He stood up and emptied his plate into the trash. “Let’s go. I’ll drop you off on my way to work.”

*As if we ever do anything different.* Jane complained inwardly. Her father held a stricter routine than a clock did. Though this was something Jane didn’t mind. There weren’t many things that were stable or predictable in her life. Especially not right now. But her father was. And it made her comfortable.

The two rode to town without saying a word. The outside blurring past her dad’s beat up old car. Jane leaned her head against the window, her music blaring through the headphones crammed into her ears. 2012’s greatest heavy metal music. One of the few things that still made her feel alive.

Eventually her dad pulled up outside of Mandeville High and Jane was snapped from her temporary reverie. As she got her things together, her dad leaned over and planted a kiss on her cheek.

“Have a good day at school.” He smiled warmly at her. “I’ll come pick you up after your appointment. 4:00?” He asked. Jane nodded and pushed open the door.

“See you later. Have a good day at work.” She said in return. Her dad gave a little salute and waved one last time as Jane shut the door and turned to head into the building.

Jane could feel two pairs of eyes upon her as she walked.

Her father’s protective gaze.

And the observation of Slenderman.

# Chapter 2:

# Objects of Obsession

The morning bell echoed painfully in Jane’s tired mind. Such loud, shrill noises always gave her a migraine anyways. But it was more of what the bell represented. Another day of barely pulling herself through class after class. Barely living.

There had been a time where she had loved school. Loved to learn, loved her classes and teachers. But it felt like a life time ago. She didn’t even feel like those memories belonged to her anymore. They felt foreign. Too many things had happened to her since then. Things that had mutated her into what she was now.

Jane had her head propped up in her hands. Tired eyes staring out of the nearest window. A storm looked like it was brewing in the distance. A looming darkness beyond the vast blue sky. Jane’s eyes scanned the environment beyond the window. An endless attempt to keep her eyes on her tormentor. Though she couldn’t see him right now. Maybe he’d finally fucked off for a bit.

Jane dug around in her pocket until her hand closed around a worn cardboard box. Pulling it out to reveal a pack of mint gum. There was only a single stick left, so she hoped it would be enough to cover for her lack of brushing this morning.

“Ooh. I love that flavor!” Someone said from Jane’s right.Jane’s eyes grinded over, appraising the student beside her. Jane didn’t think she even knew the girl. If she did, it wasn’t from more than a single interaction or two.

“Can I have a piece?” The girl smiled brightly. Her smile nearly blinded Jane with its radiance.

“Of course. Here.” Jane spoke without hesitation. Handing out her last piece of gum to this total stranger. The girl gave another bright smile and swiped away the gum.

“Thanks!” She chirped, popping it into her mouth and chewing happily.

“Happy to help….” Jane mumbled, her own breath tasting sour in her mouth. Jane knew she shouldn’t have given it away. But she had to. It wasn’t a choice, it was a need. A strong and burning desire to help. No matter what. Even at her own detriment. Whenever someone asked her for something, even if not directly, Jane couldn’t help but drop what she was doing to help.

Like all the other problems in her life, this one however*wasn’t*a result of Slenderman’s interference. No, this was her own homegrown mental issue. How lucky. Ever since the loss of her mother and brother three years ago, the obsession had plagued her relentlessly.

It was a problem. She knew it was. She wasn’t in denial over it. Ever since the incident with their neighbor’s dog, Jane knew it was something that impacted her negatively. Sometimes even the very people she was trying to help.

But that still didn’t change anything. She could tell herself to stop all she wanted. But it wasn’t enough to prevent her from feeling that burn, that drive to do whatever she could to help.

Her therapist called it an obsessive compulsion. A coping mechanism for the trauma Jane went through three years ago. Her therapist could call it whatever she wanted though. It didn’t change how Jane felt.

“Good morning class.” Mr. Krenisky called out as he entered the room. He was a short, middle aged man with a well trimmed beard and a bald head. His eyes sharp as knives behind his narrow glasses. “Today we have ourselves a new student joining us.”

Jane didn’t bother looking away from the window. She honestly couldn’t care less who the new student was. She had more important things to worry about.

“Go ahead. Introduce yourself, son.” Mr. Krenisky encouraged.

“Name’s Jeff Woods. I just moved here from New Orleans.” A low voice spoke up from the front of the class. Jane’s body immediately reacted. She could feel the hairs stand up along her arms and the back of her neck. Her eyes widened as she couldn’t help but finally turn her head towards the front of the class. Something about his voice had actually piqued her interest….

No. Not interest. It was more like…. Something else. She couldn’t quite pin down the feeling. But it wasn’t exactly something she would call…. Positive.

The boy, Jeff Woods, stood next to Mr. Krenisky. He was scrawny. Thin. His height was hard to gauge as he stood in a slumped over fashion. His hands shoved deep into the pockets of his white hoodie. The boy’s chestnut hair hung around and over his face. Jeff’s eyes drifted lazily around the room. And although Jane might have just been imagining it, she could’ve sworn his eyes stopped on hers for just a fraction longer….

Nothing about him seemed outwardly different. No more remarkable than the other lazy, tired teenagers that filled the room around her. But her body had such a visceral reaction to it that she couldn’t help but wonder if the boy was hiding something.

To be fair, so was she.

Jane let her eyes follow Jeff as he took his seat among the other students. She leaned her head into her hand, and let it tilt downwards to face her desk. Her auburn hair falling like a messy curtain around her face. Though it was still one she could see through herself. Quietly, sneakily watching him as he just sat there.

The teacher went about his lesson for the day, but Jane was unfocused as usual. Though instead of being the one watched, she herself had become the watcher. Something about Jeff Woods just…. Irked her. He felt familiar and foreign all at the same time.

She pondered and mulled over the feeling the entire time she was there. For 45 minutes she watched him. Jeff clearly wasn’t paying any attention either. His eyes wandered constantly. More than a few times he rubbed his eyes or shook his head. At first Jane thought he might have just been struggling to stay awake through the dry lecture. But the longer she watched…. The more she doubted it was quite so simple.

The way Jeff would stare off and become lost in space. The way he rubbed at his head although in pain…. All things that could, and probably should, be written off as merely inconsequential actions. But Jane couldn’t help but think…. That those gestures, the way he looked…. That it felt awfully familiar. A situation she knew all too well.

It was too early to say for sure. Jane had never even considered the idea that her tormentor would have other people to follow and stalk. But it wasn’t impossible either.

But one thing was for sure. Jane had discovered the name for what she was feeling.

Rivalry.

# Chapter 3:

# Another Escape

As it turned out, her first period was the only class she shared with Jeff Woods. The rest of her morning was free of that little nagging feeling in the back of her head.

It didn’t help matters much though. Jane was having plenty of problems before this mystery boy dropped in on her life. Though her morning was free of her usual issues, it was around noon that she felt it return in full force.

Jane was sitting in her math class, feigning interest as always. Time moved at a crawl, but her focus was splintered as always. She had long since figured out that it was a product of her tormentor. The one named Slenderman.

Whenever Slenderman was focused on her it would affect her brain in adverse ways. The first time she’d experienced it, it was nothing more than a light fog that coated her mind. Like a thin veil of static overlaid onto a TV. But overtime, as Slenderman’s grip on her grew tighter and tighter, it only grew worse.

The fog in her mind was like a blanket now. A thick wall that made the very act of thinking difficult. It slowed her, made it hard to focus on anything. It felt like she was drowning. Jane knew people thought she was on drugs. And honestly, she wished it was something that simple.

Fog didn’t even feel like the right word for it anymore. It felt more like she was…. Disconnected. Like she didn’t exist in the moment. As though she was drifting further and further away from her body. Her mind struggling to keep tethered to her physical form.

The hazy, almost dreamlike feeling was always accompanied by a tightness in Jane’s chest. A pain that constricted and pulsed deep within her. A hunger that ached for blood and slaughter.

Jane let out a quiet groan as the feeling overtook her once more. It hit her like a wave from the ocean, washing over her all at once and threatening to drown her in its embrace. Jane swallowed a lump in her throat and blinked her eyes slowly. She could feel the pain beginning to rise up in her chest. Like someone was squeezing her heart in a cold grip.

*And here I thought I was off the hook for today….* Jane complained to herself. But truth be told, she wasn’t all that surprised. Jane had lived with this…. Condition for about 5 months now. She knew how to beat it.

Jane twisted in her seat and grabbed her beaten up, black backpack from below her desk. She hoisted it up into her lap and began to dig around it.

Jane had learned that different things could subside the effects. The most effective way was to kill something. Anything. Jane had crushed a rather large frog to death once. It made her feel better physically…. But it always just felt wrong to kill without a reason like that.

It was after she’d discovered that bloodshed made the feeling go away, that she tried…. Other methods.

Jane’s eyes briefly met her wrists. Where shallow scars crisscrossed along her pale forearm. She tugged her sleeve down and kept digging.

Jane withdrew a battered notebook and a random pen from her bag. The newest method of avoiding the fog. She opened the book and thumbed through the pages. Images of tall, stick like figures flashing by her eyes. A man standing amid a forest of poorly drawn trees, eyes watching from a shadowy, ink covered page, a tall figure looming over a terrible rendition of a stick figure in bed…. Most of the pages were full. But some were still blank and waiting. Waiting for Jane to spill the darkness from her mind and onto the page.

Jane began to furiously scribble. This method was the least effective, but also the least violent. In fact it was the *only* non-violent method Jane had found to relieve some of the tension in her chest, and re-anchor her mind to her body.

Her pen darkened the page before her, etching another tall and leering figure into the notebook’s innards. She scribbled like a possessed mad-man, furiously painting the picture with nothing more than her black, ballpoint pen.

Jane wasn’t an artist by any means. She was actually quite bad. But she had learned that it didn’t matter what the quality of the art was. Just the subject. If she drew the Slenderman, or things related to him, it helped slightly. It was the only way to siphon some of the darkness, the fog, the pain, from her mind.

A mental bloodletting of sorts.

But even this only gave so much alleviation. And Jane suspected that it made the Slenderman…. Angry. She growled quietly as she felt a spike of pain begin to drill itself into her brain, deeper and deeper with every flick of her pen. A headache that quickly blossomed into a splitting migraine. One that made her whole head feel like it was throbbing.

Jane could only assume that it was the Slenderman’s way of punishing what he probably viewed as “cheating”. Since it gave no bloodshed. Jane pushed on regardless. She was never one to quit. And although with each stroke she gained more clarity, the pain also worsened. She drew for as long as she possibly could before it grew too intense to ignore. Slapping her pen down and bringing her hand to her aching head. Cupping her throbbing temple.

Jane raised her hand slowly. Her eyes squinted as the bright lights of the room only made her pain worse.

“Yes, Jane?” Her teacher called out to her, pausing her lecture.

“I need to see the nurse….” Jane mumbled. “Its my head again….”

“Go ahead. Do you need help?” All of Jane’s teachers knew about her “condition”. Though they suspected only migraines and not the true cause, obviously.

“No…. I’ll be fine.” Jane slowly pushed herself up from her seat. Grabbing only her notebook and pen. She’d come back for her backpack later. She wasted no time in escaping the classroom and making her way to the nurse’s office. It was slow going as every last bit of stimuli only added to her pounding headache. The lights overhead, the sounds of people talking nearby, the vibrations of her footsteps….

Eventually she made it there. Just barely. She pushed open the door and found the nurse’s office….. Empty. Completely and totally empty. Her eye twitched with annoyance. This was the last thing she needed right now.

“Just great….” She muttered, slipping into the room and letting the door close behind her. “Whatever…. I’ll just wait.” She decided, walking in and taking a seat at the small table. The room felt nauseatingly bright. She wished she could turn the light off…. She sat her notebook down before her and slowly continued to draw. She needed to get it all out of her system. No matter how much pain it caused her. She would rather be in pain than walking around in that fugue state. Jane always worried that if she stayed like that for too long…. That’d she’d lose control and do something bad.

So she continued to draw. Thankful at least for the silence of the nurse’s office. No people talking or being annoying….

But even that small consolation she had was soon stripped away from her. The door to the nurse’s office creaked open. Jane looked up from her “art”, hoping to see the nurse. But instead was met with a sight that made her freeze in place.

It was him. Jeff Woods.

He stood in the doorway, eyes scanning the room. He actually looked a little awkward. Maybe even nervous to be here. Jane could only stare as his eyes met hers. There was something in his. Something familiar. She’d seen those same eyes before. Tired and…. Dark. She saw them everytime she looked in the mirror.

“Uhm.” Jeff cleared his throat as he shuffled further into the room. Letting the door close behind him.

Jane knew what he was going to say before he even said it.

“She’s not here.” Jane let her eyes drop back to the paper in front of her. She didn’t want to look at them for any longer. They felt hostile. “She’s been out for like. An hour.” Jane lied, hoping it would get Jeff to leave instead of hanging around.

“Jesus.” Was all he said, slumping down into one of the waiting chairs. His legs sprawled out before him and his hands stuffed deep into his hoodie pockets. His eyes shifted around beneath his bangs. He didn’t really look at Jane anymore either. Maybe he felt the same way she did.

“And I was here first.” Jane spoke, looking up from her paper briefly once more. “Don’t forget. So I’m getting seen first.”

Jeff rolled his eyes again and pulled his cellphone from his pocket. “Yeah, I get it. Whatever.” He grumbled. Jane squinted at him for a moment longer, before letting her own eyes fall back to the task at hand.

Jane didn’t really know why she was being so standoffish to the guy. He’d really done nothing to her. She knew she was being a bit of a bitch, acting this way over a mere feeling. But it was…. A *deep* feeling. A gut instinct of sorts. Like the way one cowers in the face of a large snake, or before a deep pit. She almost wanted to ask him if he’d encountered anything. Anyone…. Strange. If Slenderman really did have his eyes on him, would he forget about Jane? Would he finally leave her in peace and pursue a new target?

Jane could only hope. Though she couldn’t help but feel the tiniest bit of remorse for Jeff. If her suspicions were true, his life was about to turn into a living hell. And who knew if Jeff had the same resolve that Jane had. The same willpower to resist the temptations of pulls of that demon.

The deafening silence in the nurse’s office was finally broken by the sound of the door opening once more. Jeff and Jane looked up in unison to see an older, slightly overweight woman standing in the doorway. Her eyes widened as she saw the two students waiting for her.

“Oh. Oops.” She gave an embarrassed chuckle. “Sorry. I must’ve forgotten to put my out for lunch sign up…. My bad kids.”

“Its okay.” Jane replied. Though Jeff remained silent. Just staring at the woman.

“Well.” The nurse set down her things at her desk and turned to look at the two of them. Her hands on her hips as her eyes darted back and forth. “Who’s first?”

“Me.” Jane answered immediately. Standing up just a little too fast. The scraping of her chair against the tile floor caused a flash of pain in her aching head. “Can we talk in the backroom please? In quiet?” Jane didn’t want Jeff listening in on her.

“Of course, Ms. Arkensaw.” The nurse nodded with a friendly, warm smile. Jane was rather familiar with Mrs. Hadley. Unfortunately, her trips to this office had become quite frequently in recent months. Before she knew about Slenderman, she’d come here to ask about her fogginess and chest pain. And after, it was for her searing headaches.

Mrs. Hadley took Jane by the shoulder and escorted her into the backroom. It wasn’t until she was in there that Jane realized she’d forgotten her notebook out on the table….

*What if Jeff looks at it?* She asked herself, nervous for just a moment.

*Let him.* She replied to herself. If Jeff was facing down Slenderman, maybe this would help him realize what was happening a bit earlier. Maybe if he could find the cause earlier than Jane did, he could avoid such heavy consequences.

Jane took a seat in the private room of the nurse’s office. It wasn’t exactly luxurious back here. As with any room in a public high school, it was pretty barebones. With old, outdated furniture that looked like it had seen WW2. Nurse Hadley’s chair creaked with a loud groan as she sat down in it, and for a moment Jane was worried it would break underneath the woman.

“So, am I correct in assuming your problem is the usual one?” The nurse asked, peering at Jane over her thin framed, red spectacles.

“Yes ma’am.” Jane answered, her voice still soft to ease the pain in her head.

“Mhm. Did you go see a doctor like I recommended?”

“Yes.” Jane remembered the trip well. Her father was practically pulling his hair out with worry as she was tested by the MRI Scan *and* a CT scan. Jane knew they would come back empty, but her father was relieved when they revealed no tumors or bleeding in the brain. “They couldn’t find anything physically wrong with me.”

“Hmmm. Well, I guess that’s good in a way. Right?” The nurse answered with cheerful optimism. “It could be worse. Did the doctor give you anything to help?”

“He gave me a preventative treatment plan. But its not working. And neither did the pain medication they gave me….” Jane was being honest. But she could tell by the doubtful eye the nurse was casting her, that Mrs. Hadley didn’t think so.

“Right. So, I take it you want the “usual” treatment then?” The nurse sighed and took off her glasses, tucking them away in her shirt pocket.

“Its…. The only thing that helps.” Jane shrunk in her chair, folding in on herself in shame. She hated having to ask for this. She knew how it looked.

The nurse stares at Jane for a moment before shaking her head slowly. “You can’t keep coming here and asking to sleep in here. You know how it looks for you to miss so many classes.”

“I know. I’m sorry….” Jane couldn’t meet the nurse’s eyes. Her guilt burning through her like wildfire. Nurse Hadley placed her hand over Jane’s, causing her to look up however.

“Look, Jane. I know things have been hard since…. The incident. But you can’t keep going on like this. Its not healthy.” The nurse searched Jane’s eyes. “You haven’t been sleeping very well. Have you?”

“No.” Jane hadn’t had a goodnight’s rest in a long time.

“Are you still seeing your therapist?”

“Yes. I see her today after school.”

“Well, good. How about this? I’ll let you sleep in here. But I want you to talk to your therapist about this. About your insomnia. Its not healthy and it’s starting to really wear on you, I think. Okay? Can you do that for me?”

“Yes ma’am. Thank you.” Jane forced herself to smile. She wondered if it looked as fake as it felt.

“Good. Now go lay down and get some rest…. But this is the last time I can let you do this. Okay? I don’t let other students have that same luxury you know.”

Jane nodded her thanks and stood up. Mrs. Hadley patted her on the shoulder one last time before stepping out of the backroom to deal with Jeff. Left alone, Jane walked over to the only bed here and laid down upon it.

Sleep was really the only thing that made the headache go away. She suspected it was just a matter of waiting it out, and resting helped that time go by faster.

Jane wished it was as easy as talking to her therapist. She wished it was something as simple as migraines or insomnia. At least that was explainable. At least those had methods, however shaky they may be, that could be used to fix them.

But not this.

Nobody could help Jane Arkensaw.

# Chapter 1:

# Pointless

Death stared at her through the mirror.

Or at least, that’s what she felt like anyways.

Jane Arkensaw never felt good after waking up in the mornings. Not recently that is. Not since she’d been noticed by the demon that stalks the shadows of this town. Not since her dreams had all but turned to vicious nightmares. Not since her mind had been invaded.

But none of that mattered. Sure, it certainly mattered to Jane. But it hardly felt like her opinion was of importance to anyone other than herself. Outside of her therapist, it felt like nobody cared that Jane walked around like a zombie each and everyday. Not her teachers, not the kids at school, not the guidance counselor. Nobody. Her father might have cared, if Jane ever told him how she was really feeling inside. But the consequences that came with that decision almost outweighed the benefits.

And so, Jane pretended that she was fine. She woke up every day and slathered her sagging eyes with makeup, sprayed on perfume to hide the unshowered scent of her body, and faced every day with a mask.

Faced everyday hiding it.

Faced everyday faking it.

Jane gave a deep sigh as she stared deep into her own tired face. She just wanted to go back to bed. Or maybe just keep staring at herself. Keep staring deep into the ocean blue eyes upon her face. One of the few features of her body she really liked. Everyone said they were her mother’s eyes. And Jane liked that. Like an heirloom that was passed down.

She would’ve stayed holed up in the bathroom forever if she could. But a shout from down the hall broke her from her thoughts.

“Janie! Up and at ‘em! Its 7:15, gotta get moving soon!” Her father shouted across the house. Jane sighed through her nose again and started going about her morning routine. Or at least, deciding what parts of it she cared enough to do.

Use the bathroom? Yes.

Shower? She didn’t have time. At least that was the argument she gave herself. But deep down she knew the real reason why. It was the same reason why she didn’t shower last night. Or the night before that. She would shower tonight. For sure.

Probably.

Brush teeth? Jane debated it. And ultimately decided she could skip today. She didn’t have the energy or motivation to bother. She’d just chew some gum later. It’d be fine. She brushed her teeth yesterday actually. So she considered that being ahead of the game.

Make up? Today it would be needed, unfortunately. Jane had an appointment with the therapist later and knew that if she showed up with such deep bags under her eyes she’d get chewed out. So she slathered her face with the thick, creamy foundation. Spreading it around with her spongy brush until it hid the bruise like bags beneath her eyes.

Brush hair? Jane considered her messy locks in the mirror. The strands falling unevenly down to her mid-back. It was frizzy, uneven, and generally just in need of a trim. Jane knew her hair would look a million times better if she took even slightly more care of it. But she never did. Instead of brushing it, Jane decided it would just be easier to tie it back into a bun. Though several strands still hung loosely around her face. Like vines upon a condemned building.

Jane exited the bathroom and slipped quietly into her room. She could hear her dad in the kitchen making breakfast. She hadn’t decided if she was going to eat yet today. Maybe she would. Just to make her dad happy.

Get dressed? Obviously. Though Jane wished on many occasions that she could just wear her pajamas to school. She would if she could. That was one of the things she was looking forward to most about college, actually. She heard that nobody really cared if you came to class in your pajamas. Or in dirty old sweats. That sounded like heaven to Jane.

But unfortunately for her, Mandeville High School was a lot more strict than a college was. So Jane threw on a pair of torn up jeans, a *Motionless in White* band tee, and then a black zip up jacket over the top. She’d had the jacket for years. And worn it so frequently that the old green alien face on the back had all but faded away.

Jane had newer jackets. Gifts from relatives and such for Christmas or birthdays. But none of them were from her mom.

This one was.

So, it was the one she kept. Simple.

Jane finished off her outfit by stuffing her feet into her worn out high top shoes. Tie them? No point. They always came undone anyways. So instead she just stuffed them down the sides.

Jane grabbed her backpack and cellophone before shuffling out of her room and down the hall to the kitchen. Her slow, undead shuffling made the walk through their tiny house seem far longer than it normally would have.

“Good morning, Janie!” Mr. Arkensaw chirped happily as Jane stepped into the kitchen. He tossed a glance over his shoulder, his own black curls bouncing with the movement. “Sleep good?” He asked as he returned to his cooking of breakfast.

“I slept fine.” Jane lied as shewatched her father go about the task of preparing breakfast. She bristled at it. “I can help, you know.” She insisted as sheslumped into a seat at the kitchen table.

“Well, I know you can Janie. But you were still getting ready. If I waited on you we’d not have anything to eat this morning. Plus, its not like I can’t handle it on my own.”

“Whatever.” Jane grumbled. Her father knew she liked to help. Needed to help. And yet still insisted on doing so much all by himself. It irked her to no end. “Can I have some coffee then?”

“Pots already made. I’m whipping up some quick bacon if you want some.” Mr. Arkensaw glanced at the time and bit his lip. “Probably shouldn’t have…. Not with the time. But how could I resist? You know what I always say about breakfast!”

Jane pushed herself up from the table and grabbed the handle of the coffee pot, but soon found her father’s hand over her own.

“Oh, here Janie. Let me do it.” He slid his hand down and took the pot from Jane, pouring her a cup himself. “Wouldn’t want you to get burned again.” He smiled kindly and handed her the mug. “Be careful. Its-”

“Hot. I know. Thanks.” Jane struggled not to roll her eyes as she took the drink. Sipping it as she returned to her seat. All it took was a small burn, one time, for Jane’s father to become convinced that she was incapable of pouring her own coffee. As with everything, she knew it came from a place of love. But that didn’t stop it from being annoying.

Jane absently sipped at her coffee while staring out the window. Her dad was speaking to her but she wasn’t paying attention. Her eyes were fixated on the man in the woods. The tall figure that always stood just on the edge of her vision. Watching her. Tormenting her. Enticing her. She squeezed her eyes shut as the static buzzed in her brain. Her head feeling like it was about to pop like an overfilled balloon. She felt a drop of warm blood leak from her nose. She hurriedly wiped it away before her dad could see and make a fuss over it.

“Don’t forget about your visit with the therapist today, honey.” Her father reminded her as he took his seat opposite from her at the table.

“I know dad. You don’t need to remind me.” Jane mumbled as she lifted her cup to her mouth. She sucked down the bitter coffee, trying to wash the metallic twang of blood that seemed to haunt the back of her throat.

“Are you sure you want to keep seeing this therapist? I could take you somewhere else. Its no problem at all Janie, really-”

“No. I like Ms. Crosby.” Jane shook her head and interrupted her father. “I don’t want to speak to some stranger. It took me long enough to get used to her. Let alone some one new.”

“I know…. But are you sure a regular therapist is really qualified for this? Your mental health….” Her father trailed off. The topic was a sore one. He always worried about Jane. To an unhealthy degree. Mr. Arkensaw was always an anxious person, but after the death of his wife and son, his worry for Jane only increased 10 fold.

“Its fine dad. Qualifications don’t matter. All that matters is how good the person can do their job.” Jane and her father had this discussion too many times to count. But the fact of the matter was simple. Jane didn’t want to see anyone else. No matter how many degrees someone had, there were just some things that couldn’t be learned in school. Her father, ultimately, accepted her decision. But it didn’t stop him from trying to persuade her otherwise.

Jane knew her father was just trying to make her happy. And at the same time, Jane was just trying to make her father happy in return.

“Alright…. I just hope its working is all.” Mr. Arkensaw looked up at the cat shaped clock on the wall above them. “Better get moving.” He stood up and emptied his plate into the trash. “Let’s go. I’ll drop you off on my way to work.”

*As if we ever do anything different.* Jane complained inwardly. Her father held a stricter routine than a clock did. Though this was something Jane didn’t mind. There weren’t many things that were stable or predictable in her life. Especially not right now. But her father was. And it made her comfortable.

The two rode to town without saying a word. The outside blurring past her dad’s beat up old car. Jane leaned her head against the window, her music blaring through the headphones crammed into her ears. 2012’s greatest heavy metal music. One of the few things that still made her feel alive.

Eventually her dad pulled up outside of Mandeville High and Jane was snapped from her temporary reverie. As she got her things together, her dad leaned over and planted a kiss on her cheek.

“Have a good day at school.” He smiled warmly at her. “I’ll come pick you up after your appointment. 4:00?” He asked. Jane nodded and pushed open the door.

“See you later. Have a good day at work.” She said in return. Her dad gave a little salute and waved one last time as Jane shut the door and turned to head into the building.

Jane could feel two pairs of eyes upon her as she walked.

Her father’s protective gaze.

And the observation of Slenderman.



# Chapter 2:

# Objects of Obsession

The morning bell echoed painfully in Jane’s tired mind. Such loud, shrill noises always gave her a migraine anyways. But it was more of what the bell represented. Another day of barely pulling herself through class after class. Barely living.

There had been a time where she had loved school. Loved to learn, loved her classes and teachers. But it felt like a life time ago. She didn’t even feel like those memories belonged to her anymore. They felt foreign. Too many things had happened to her since then. Things that had mutated her into what she was now.

Jane had her head propped up in her hands. Tired eyes staring out of the nearest window. A storm looked like it was brewing in the distance. A looming darkness beyond the vast blue sky. Jane’s eyes scanned the environment beyond the window. An endless attempt to keep her eyes on her tormentor. Though she couldn’t see him right now. Maybe he’d finally fucked off for a bit.

Jane dug around in her pocket until her hand closed around a worn cardboard box. Pulling it out to reveal a pack of mint gum. There was only a single stick left, so she hoped it would be enough to cover for her lack of brushing this morning.

“Ooh. I love that flavor!” Someone said from Jane’s right.Jane’s eyes grinded over, appraising the student beside her. Jane didn’t think she even knew the girl. If she did, it wasn’t from more than a single interaction or two.

“Can I have a piece?” The girl smiled brightly. Her smile nearly blinded Jane with its radiance.

“Of course. Here.” Jane spoke without hesitation. Handing out her last piece of gum to this total stranger. The girl gave another bright smile and swiped away the gum.

“Thanks!” She chirped, popping it into her mouth and chewing happily.

“Happy to help….” Jane mumbled, her own breath tasting sour in her mouth. Jane knew she shouldn’t have given it away. But she had to. It wasn’t a choice, it was a need. A strong and burning desire to help. No matter what. Even at her own detriment. Whenever someone asked her for something, even if not directly, Jane couldn’t help but drop what she was doing to help.

Like all the other problems in her life, this one however*wasn’t*a result of Slenderman’s interference. No, this was her own homegrown mental issue. How lucky. Ever since the loss of her mother and brother three years ago, the obsession had plagued her relentlessly.

It was a problem. She knew it was. She wasn’t in denial over it. Ever since the incident with their neighbor’s dog, Jane knew it was something that impacted her negatively. Sometimes even the very people she was trying to help.

But that still didn’t change anything. She could tell herself to stop all she wanted. But it wasn’t enough to prevent her from feeling that burn, that drive to do whatever she could to help.

Her therapist called it an obsessive compulsion. A coping mechanism for the trauma Jane went through three years ago. Her therapist could call it whatever she wanted though. It didn’t change how Jane felt.

“Good morning class.” Mr. Krenisky called out as he entered the room. He was a short, middle aged man with a well trimmed beard and a bald head. His eyes sharp as knives behind his narrow glasses. “Today we have ourselves a new student joining us.”

Jane didn’t bother looking away from the window. She honestly couldn’t care less who the new student was. She had more important things to worry about.

“Go ahead. Introduce yourself, son.” Mr. Krenisky encouraged.

“Name’s Jeff Woods. I just moved here from New Orleans.” A low voice spoke up from the front of the class. Jane’s body immediately reacted. She could feel the hairs stand up along her arms and the back of her neck. Her eyes widened as she couldn’t help but finally turn her head towards the front of the class. Something about his voice had actually piqued her interest….

No. Not interest. It was more like…. Something else. She couldn’t quite pin down the feeling. But it wasn’t exactly something she would call…. Positive.

The boy, Jeff Woods, stood next to Mr. Krenisky. He was scrawny. Thin. His height was hard to gauge as he stood in a slumped over fashion. His hands shoved deep into the pockets of his white hoodie. The boy’s chestnut hair hung around and over his face. Jeff’s eyes drifted lazily around the room. And although Jane might have just been imagining it, she could’ve sworn his eyes stopped on hers for just a fraction longer….

Nothing about him seemed outwardly different. No more remarkable than the other lazy, tired teenagers that filled the room around her. But her body had such a visceral reaction to it that she couldn’t help but wonder if the boy was hiding something.

To be fair, so was she.

Jane let her eyes follow Jeff as he took his seat among the other students. She leaned her head into her hand, and let it tilt downwards to face her desk. Her auburn hair falling like a messy curtain around her face. Though it was still one she could see through herself. Quietly, sneakily watching him as he just sat there.

The teacher went about his lesson for the day, but Jane was unfocused as usual. Though instead of being the one watched, she herself had become the watcher. Something about Jeff Woods just…. Irked her. He felt familiar and foreign all at the same time.

She pondered and mulled over the feeling the entire time she was there. For 45 minutes she watched him. Jeff clearly wasn’t paying any attention either. His eyes wandered constantly. More than a few times he rubbed his eyes or shook his head. At first Jane thought he might have just been struggling to stay awake through the dry lecture. But the longer she watched…. The more she doubted it was quite so simple.

The way Jeff would stare off and become lost in space. The way he rubbed at his head although in pain…. All things that could, and probably should, be written off as merely inconsequential actions. But Jane couldn’t help but think…. That those gestures, the way he looked…. That it felt awfully familiar. A situation she knew all too well.

It was too early to say for sure. Jane had never even considered the idea that her tormentor would have other people to follow and stalk. But it wasn’t impossible either.

But one thing was for sure. Jane had discovered the name for what she was feeling.

Rivalry.



# Chapter 3:

# Another Escape

As it turned out, her first period was the only class she shared with Jeff Woods. The rest of her morning was free of that little nagging feeling in the back of her head.

It didn’t help matters much though. Jane was having plenty of problems before this mystery boy dropped in on her life. Though her morning was free of her usual issues, it was around noon that she felt it return in full force.

Jane was sitting in her math class, feigning interest as always. Time moved at a crawl, but her focus was splintered as always. She had long since figured out that it was a product of her tormentor. The one named Slenderman.

Whenever Slenderman was focused on her it would affect her brain in adverse ways. The first time she’d experienced it, it was nothing more than a light fog that coated her mind. Like a thin veil of static overlaid onto a TV. But overtime, as Slenderman’s grip on her grew tighter and tighter, it only grew worse.

The fog in her mind was like a blanket now. A thick wall that made the very act of thinking difficult. It slowed her, made it hard to focus on anything. It felt like she was drowning. Jane knew people thought she was on drugs. And honestly, she wished it was something that simple.

Fog didn’t even feel like the right word for it anymore. It felt more like she was…. Disconnected. Like she didn’t exist in the moment. As though she was drifting further and further away from her body. Her mind struggling to keep tethered to her physical form.

The hazy, almost dreamlike feeling was always accompanied by a tightness in Jane’s chest. A pain that constricted and pulsed deep within her. A hunger that ached for blood and slaughter.

Jane let out a quiet groan as the feeling overtook her once more. It hit her like a wave from the ocean, washing over her all at once and threatening to drown her in its embrace. Jane swallowed a lump in her throat and blinked her eyes slowly. She could feel the pain beginning to rise up in her chest. Like someone was squeezing her heart in a cold grip.

*And here I thought I was off the hook for today….* Jane complained to herself. But truth be told, she wasn’t all that surprised. Jane had lived with this…. Condition for about 5 months now. She knew how to beat it.

Jane twisted in her seat and grabbed her beaten up, black backpack from below her desk. She hoisted it up into her lap and began to dig around it.

Jane had learned that different things could subside the effects. The most effective way was to kill something. Anything. Jane had crushed a rather large frog to death once. It made her feel better physically…. But it always just felt wrong to kill without a reason like that.

It was after she’d discovered that bloodshed made the feeling go away, that she tried…. Other methods.

Jane’s eyes briefly met her wrists. Where shallow scars crisscrossed along her pale forearm. She tugged her sleeve down and kept digging.

Jane withdrew a battered notebook and a random pen from her bag. The newest method of avoiding the fog. She opened the book and thumbed through the pages. Images of tall, stick like figures flashing by her eyes. A man standing amid a forest of poorly drawn trees, eyes watching from a shadowy, ink covered page, a tall figure looming over a terrible rendition of a stick figure in bed…. Most of the pages were full. But some were still blank and waiting. Waiting for Jane to spill the darkness from her mind and onto the page.

Jane began to furiously scribble. This method was the least effective, but also the least violent. In fact it was the *only* non-violent method Jane had found to relieve some of the tension in her chest, and re-anchor her mind to her body.

Her pen darkened the page before her, etching another tall and leering figure into the notebook’s innards. She scribbled like a possessed mad-man, furiously painting the picture with nothing more than her black, ballpoint pen.

Jane wasn’t an artist by any means. She was actually quite bad. But she had learned that it didn’t matter what the quality of the art was. Just the subject. If she drew the Slenderman, or things related to him, it helped slightly. It was the only way to siphon some of the darkness, the fog, the pain, from her mind.

A mental bloodletting of sorts.

But even this only gave so much alleviation. And Jane suspected that it made the Slenderman…. Angry. She growled quietly as she felt a spike of pain begin to drill itself into her brain, deeper and deeper with every flick of her pen. A headache that quickly blossomed into a splitting migraine. One that made her whole head feel like it was throbbing.

Jane could only assume that it was the Slenderman’s way of punishing what he probably viewed as “cheating”. Since it gave no bloodshed. Jane pushed on regardless. She was never one to quit. And although with each stroke she gained more clarity, the pain also worsened. She drew for as long as she possibly could before it grew too intense to ignore. Slapping her pen down and bringing her hand to her aching head. Cupping her throbbing temple.

Jane raised her hand slowly. Her eyes squinted as the bright lights of the room only made her pain worse.

“Yes, Jane?” Her teacher called out to her, pausing her lecture.

“I need to see the nurse….” Jane mumbled. “Its my head again….”

“Go ahead. Do you need help?” All of Jane’s teachers knew about her “condition”. Though they suspected only migraines and not the true cause, obviously.

“No…. I’ll be fine.” Jane slowly pushed herself up from her seat. Grabbing only her notebook and pen. She’d come back for her backpack later. She wasted no time in escaping the classroom and making her way to the nurse’s office. It was slow going as every last bit of stimuli only added to her pounding headache. The lights overhead, the sounds of people talking nearby, the vibrations of her footsteps….

Eventually she made it there. Just barely. She pushed open the door and found the nurse’s office….. Empty. Completely and totally empty. Her eye twitched with annoyance. This was the last thing she needed right now.

“Just great….” She muttered, slipping into the room and letting the door close behind her. “Whatever…. I’ll just wait.” She decided, walking in and taking a seat at the small table. The room felt nauseatingly bright. She wished she could turn the light off…. She sat her notebook down before her and slowly continued to draw. She needed to get it all out of her system. No matter how much pain it caused her. She would rather be in pain than walking around in that fugue state. Jane always worried that if she stayed like that for too long…. That’d she’d lose control and do something bad.

So she continued to draw. Thankful at least for the silence of the nurse’s office. No people talking or being annoying….

But even that small consolation she had was soon stripped away from her. The door to the nurse’s office creaked open. Jane looked up from her “art”, hoping to see the nurse. But instead was met with a sight that made her freeze in place.

It was him. Jeff Woods.

He stood in the doorway, eyes scanning the room. He actually looked a little awkward. Maybe even nervous to be here. Jane could only stare as his eyes met hers. There was something in his. Something familiar. She’d seen those same eyes before. Tired and…. Dark. She saw them everytime she looked in the mirror.

“Uhm.” Jeff cleared his throat as he shuffled further into the room. Letting the door close behind him.

Jane knew what he was going to say before he even said it.

“She’s not here.” Jane let her eyes drop back to the paper in front of her. She didn’t want to look at them for any longer. They felt hostile. “She’s been out for like. An hour.” Jane lied, hoping it would get Jeff to leave instead of hanging around.

“Jesus.” Was all he said, slumping down into one of the waiting chairs. His legs sprawled out before him and his hands stuffed deep into his hoodie pockets. His eyes shifted around beneath his bangs. He didn’t really look at Jane anymore either. Maybe he felt the same way she did.

“And I was here first.” Jane spoke, looking up from her paper briefly once more. “Don’t forget. So I’m getting seen first.”

Jeff rolled his eyes again and pulled his cellphone from his pocket. “Yeah, I get it. Whatever.” He grumbled. Jane squinted at him for a moment longer, before letting her own eyes fall back to the task at hand.

Jane didn’t really know why she was being so standoffish to the guy. He’d really done nothing to her. She knew she was being a bit of a bitch, acting this way over a mere feeling. But it was…. A *deep* feeling. A gut instinct of sorts. Like the way one cowers in the face of a large snake, or before a deep pit. She almost wanted to ask him if he’d encountered anything. Anyone…. Strange. If Slenderman really did have his eyes on him, would he forget about Jane? Would he finally leave her in peace and pursue a new target?

Jane could only hope. Though she couldn’t help but feel the tiniest bit of remorse for Jeff. If her suspicions were true, his life was about to turn into a living hell. And who knew if Jeff had the same resolve that Jane had. The same willpower to resist the temptations of pulls of that demon.

The deafening silence in the nurse’s office was finally broken by the sound of the door opening once more. Jeff and Jane looked up in unison to see an older, slightly overweight woman standing in the doorway. Her eyes widened as she saw the two students waiting for her.

“Oh. Oops.” She gave an embarrassed chuckle. “Sorry. I must’ve forgotten to put my out for lunch sign up…. My bad kids.”

“Its okay.” Jane replied. Though Jeff remained silent. Just staring at the woman.

“Well.” The nurse set down her things at her desk and turned to look at the two of them. Her hands on her hips as her eyes darted back and forth. “Who’s first?”

“Me.” Jane answered immediately. Standing up just a little too fast. The scraping of her chair against the tile floor caused a flash of pain in her aching head. “Can we talk in the backroom please? In quiet?” Jane didn’t want Jeff listening in on her.

“Of course, Ms. Arkensaw.” The nurse nodded with a friendly, warm smile. Jane was rather familiar with Mrs. Hadley. Unfortunately, her trips to this office had become quite frequently in recent months. Before she knew about Slenderman, she’d come here to ask about her fogginess and chest pain. And after, it was for her searing headaches.

Mrs. Hadley took Jane by the shoulder and escorted her into the backroom. It wasn’t until she was in there that Jane realized she’d forgotten her notebook out on the table….

*What if Jeff looks at it?* She asked herself, nervous for just a moment.

*Let him.* She replied to herself. If Jeff was facing down Slenderman, maybe this would help him realize what was happening a bit earlier. Maybe if he could find the cause earlier than Jane did, he could avoid such heavy consequences.

Jane took a seat in the private room of the nurse’s office. It wasn’t exactly luxurious back here. As with any room in a public high school, it was pretty barebones. With old, outdated furniture that looked like it had seen WW2. Nurse Hadley’s chair creaked with a loud groan as she sat down in it, and for a moment Jane was worried it would break underneath the woman.

“So, am I correct in assuming your problem is the usual one?” The nurse asked, peering at Jane over her thin framed, red spectacles.

“Yes ma’am.” Jane answered, her voice still soft to ease the pain in her head.

“Mhm. Did you go see a doctor like I recommended?”

“Yes.” Jane remembered the trip well. Her father was practically pulling his hair out with worry as she was tested by the MRI Scan *and* a CT scan. Jane knew they would come back empty, but her father was relieved when they revealed no tumors or bleeding in the brain. “They couldn’t find anything physically wrong with me.”

“Hmmm. Well, I guess that’s good in a way. Right?” The nurse answered with cheerful optimism. “It could be worse. Did the doctor give you anything to help?”

“He gave me a preventative treatment plan. But its not working. And neither did the pain medication they gave me….” Jane was being honest. But she could tell by the doubtful eye the nurse was casting her, that Mrs. Hadley didn’t think so.

“Right. So, I take it you want the “usual” treatment then?” The nurse sighed and took off her glasses, tucking them away in her shirt pocket.

“Its…. The only thing that helps.” Jane shrunk in her chair, folding in on herself in shame. She hated having to ask for this. She knew how it looked.

The nurse stares at Jane for a moment before shaking her head slowly. “You can’t keep coming here and asking to sleep in here. You know how it looks for you to miss so many classes.”

“I know. I’m sorry….” Jane couldn’t meet the nurse’s eyes. Her guilt burning through her like wildfire. Nurse Hadley placed her hand over Jane’s, causing her to look up however.

“Look, Jane. I know things have been hard since…. The incident. But you can’t keep going on like this. Its not healthy.” The nurse searched Jane’s eyes. “You haven’t been sleeping very well. Have you?”

“No.” Jane hadn’t had a goodnight’s rest in a long time.

“Are you still seeing your therapist?”

“Yes. I see her today after school.”

“Well, good. How about this? I’ll let you sleep in here. But I want you to talk to your therapist about this. About your insomnia. Its not healthy and it’s starting to really wear on you, I think. Okay? Can you do that for me?”

“Yes ma’am. Thank you.” Jane forced herself to smile. She wondered if it looked as fake as it felt.

“Good. Now go lay down and get some rest…. But this is the last time I can let you do this. Okay? I don’t let other students have that same luxury you know.”

Jane nodded her thanks and stood up. Mrs. Hadley patted her on the shoulder one last time before stepping out of the backroom to deal with Jeff. Left alone, Jane walked over to the only bed here and laid down upon it.

Sleep was really the only thing that made the headache go away. She suspected it was just a matter of waiting it out, and resting helped that time go by faster.

Jane wished it was as easy as talking to her therapist. She wished it was something as simple as migraines or insomnia. At least that was explainable. At least those had methods, however shaky they may be, that could be used to fix them.

But not this.

Nobody could help Jane Arkensaw.

1n8s4nn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1n8s4nn/did_an_increase_in_t4_make_you_feel_much_better/,Did an increase in T4 make you feel much better?,"Prescribed levothyroxine for 15 years, I have been on most brands \[Levoxyl, Unithroid, Synthroid, Tirosent\] and many generics \[Mylan, Accord, Sandoz, Lannet and others\]. My dose has always been 50 micrograms.  



Over the 15 years and all those manufacturers, my T4 has varied between 1.0 and 1.2: the normal range is 1.0 to 2.0 so it seems I am dwelling on the very minimum of normal thyroid hormone.



I have never been tried on a dose higher than 50 micrograms, and considering I am still having substantial fatigue, I want to see my T4 up more towards the middle of the normal range.  At least, I would like to experience above 1.2 or better 1.3 or 1.4 and see what life would be like there.  



I'm on the Lupin generic sees my lowest consecutive T4 scores ever and decided to next pay up for and switch to the Tirosint brand name expensive encapsulated levothyroxine.  I was on Tirosint once and though it non-special, what makes me want to go on it now is to stabilize on a name brand one that will continue to be available instead of losing time switching between generics.  The next larger dose than 50 mcg Tirosint is 62.5, think about it, that's 25% greater dose, which seems significant?



Has anyone experienced a 20% or 25% increase in T4 and felt better?  One source I checked said the increase is only equivalent to a single cup of coffee a day, but which still sounds pretty good considering I have to watch my caffeine.   Is moving from 1.1 to 1.3 T4 going to make a noticeable difference or am I to be disappointed in how little improvement it offers?

Backstory: She lives alone. My father died years ago. It’s just her, my old sister (that is money hungry), and I remaining of the family I grew up with. I’m 50 and my sister is 51. We both have families and don’t live too far apart. My mom has created fights after my father passed that made my sister and I stop talking to her for years but at different times. Suddenly, my sister decided she was going to become close to her again and before she did she called me and told me it wasn’t good to be around my mom. I should stop hanging around her. Talking about how negative mom is all the time. That didn’t make any sense. It all seemed set up. But my mom told me horrible things about her when they weren’t talking. After they made up, They became super close. Fast forward to now. My sister called a couple of months ago and said my mom had called 911 on her own, has pneumonia, and I needed to come up to the hospital. So, I did. But my mom seemed fine and my sister wasn’t in the room she went home. I got a call she had to go on a cruise the next day that she’d already paid for. I found out my mom had been in the hospital 4 days before she let me know. Fwd to this past week: I stayed with my mom in the hospital most of the day and she asked me to get her some things to bring back up there. I didn’t know where anything was in her bedroom. First drawer I opened I found my husband’s zippo Horseshoe casino slots lighter he’d received long ago. He received 4 of them after winning a large jackpot. ( he was murdered in 2001) so, I wondered what else they took. I found my first boyfriend’s class ring, his military ring. My first husband’s class ring. My jewelry box with my jewelry in it under her bed. I left some things of mine to discuss later. Before I found my things, When my sister found out I was at her house alone taking care of my mom’s dog and helping her clean before she arrived home from the hospital I could tell she wasn’t happy about it. Within an hour she came over claiming she had to waste time for a vision test and I had to leave to go to my doctor’s appt and she stayed in my mom’s house. It was after that I’d found my things either her or my father had taken. After she got home from the hospital I went home after watching her for a day. My sister asked me to take her to her outpatient surgery. I arrived early in the morning, on her coffee table was the exact 2 boxes I found my things in. On display, but she didn’t say anything about it. Just there for me to see. Out of all the many many jewelry boxes stuffed with crap they took out the 2 I found my things in and took back.

More than that, my skin has almost completely stopped hiving up. I got Dermatographia in 2020 (probs COVID vaccine or antibiotics I was taking at the same time) 

I had it for 2 years, quit dairy and started eating a cleaner diet and it went away completely. It came back a few months ago with vigor but this elimination diet seems to be making a HUGE difference. It’s pretty strict, I’m eating pretty much only chicken and turkey cooked with olive oil and salt, green tea, apples, blue berries, cherries, veggies and quinoa, and a some nuts. No spices, seasoning other than coconut aminos and salt, no processed foods, added sugar, wheat, gluten, coffee, alcohol, dairy or high histamine foods.

Going to slowly bring stuff back into the diet but it’s really cool to know something I’m eating is a trigger! 

Moreover, Zyrtec has withdrawal symptoms of Urticaria (cruel) which I had the last time around and don’t this time, making me think the diet is working double time!

I have recently started hitting the gym and trying to be consistent to go at least 4-5 days a week. my primary goal is to reduce my belly fat and love handles and secondary goal is to gain some muscle mass. I am 5'7"" and weigh 70Kg. This is what I am currently doing at the gym.

Day 1 - Chest and Triceps ( 3 exercises for each area and 3 sets for each exercise).

Day 2 - Biceps and Back ( 3 exercises for each area and 3 sets for each exercise).

Day 3 - Shoulder and Love Handles ( 3 exercises for each area and 3 sets for each exercise).

Day 4 - Legs (4 exercises and 3 sets for each exercise).

Day 5 - Core ( crunches, scissors, planks, leg raise).

I am finishing everyday 15 minutes on the treadmill ( 10 minutes walk + 5 minutes run).

I feel my diet is pretty solid
- One scoop of Gold Standard of 100% Whey on the day I go to gym
- 2 eggs omelette and a low carb, high fiber tortilla(60 cal, 18g Fibers, 2g Carbs) for breakfast
- 100gm of chicken breast and 200gm of veggies (mostly cauliflower/eggplant/mushrooms/ greens(spinach, kale, lettuce)) for lunch.
- dinner same as lunch with a bowl of greek yogurt (100 cal, 17g proteins, 7g carbs).
I cook all my meals with minimum amount of olive oil/butter/mustard oil.

Questions:
1. Since my focus is to reduce the fat around my stomach and love handles, should I change my exercise schedule to focus more on core and less on lifting weight.
2. I drink black coffee before hitting the gym in the morning, is that ok or should I get creatine?
3. Is my diet ok or should I add/remove something?
4. I was planning to get Fittr subscription. Has anyone used it before? is it worth it?
5. What’s more important? Doing more reps in a set with less weight or increase the weight in each set with less reps?

About 2 weeks into semi regularly seeing him, I attempted to cuddle with him on the couch. He stopped me and said “what are you doing? We’ve only known each other 2 weeks”… I was really taken back but maybe he’s right?


To give context on where I’m at in this now, fast forward 10 months, he doesn’t cuddle, rarely initiates sex, lets me give him blowjobs then doesn’t do anything for me, when he first started fucking me, it felt magical. He was insanely good. He took his time with me, dirty talked me. Now I feel like a masturbation sleeve. No post sex cuddles. No post sex talking even. He just turns on the tv and rolls over to go to sleep eventually. Not a goodnight. It took him 8 months to say I love you, I cracked and said it first during a fight. We hardly kiss, and if we do it’s just a little peck. we used to make out. Now that he has me, he doesn’t want to kiss me. Everything that goes wrong is my fault, I’m too sensitive, “my feelings are my own problem to deal with”, I need too much, wanting affection is “hallmark 7th grade bullshit, he’s a man”


Anyways,


Here are some key moments that I can’t choke down and don’t know if I’m over reacting or not. 


I had 2 cats, 5 and 7 years old. With me since babies. My whole heart. He knew they existed. But then 4 months into dating, he said he’s highly allergic to cats, can barely breathe, etc. 
He still let them come to the house for a trial period. It went horribly. There’s no doubt he’s allergic to cats. I tried everything, hepa, food changed, bathes, deep cleaning, didn’t matter. 

He said if I want to make this work they have to be rehomed. 
I am 32, desperate to get married and have a family. He said he’s slow to open up, would become more affectionate with time, would never hurt me, when he loves he loves hard, it’s just slower for him. 

I lost my tenancy at my house. I couldn’t afford anything else on the rental market, and he kept telling me the relationship felt stagnant and idle until I move in. 
I felt backed against a corner. I had to give away my cats. They’ve been rehomed twice. They didn’t work out at the first place. I want to kill myself. I miss them so much. I feel like I made such a big mistake.  He offered me no support during this. When I’d cry about them he would get mad and storm out. He never held me through it, never said it’s going to be okay, this is for our future, nothing reassuring. I am still grieving them like it happened yesterday. It’s been 2 months. I cry in private all the time, im scared for him to see me cry because of how he reacts. He has never asked how I’m doing. 

I moved in, and I had to throw nearly everything I own out. All I have is my bed and my clothes. My decade of building up is gone. He had no room for my stuff. He’s a minimalist. I can have one coffee cup, etc. 
When I had to throw everything out manually myself, he was never around. He was out working out, at his shop dicking around, etc. I had to actually ask him to come help me, and then he’d just show up and start shoving everything into garbage bags, not asking me or working with me, just treating my stuff like it’s all garbage. And then get pissed off when I’d say “hey wait that thing is really important to me”

When I have emotions he loses it on me. He’s called me a lazy bitch for letting dishes and laundry pile for 3 days right after I gave my cats away and was grieving and in distress. He’s called me a cunt, told me to shut the fuck up. I’m immature. A real woman would hold shit down, Get a grip, he’s thrown things at walls, walked out on me and slammed doors, whipped his iPad at me after asking for help fixing an issue with it, etc. the only way this doesn’t happen, is if I keep my mouth shut, do what needs to be done, don’t ask for affection and connection, and just be there for him. 

Once I moved in, he invested a substantial amount of money into me, 12.5k, to get corrective surgery on a ton of loose skin I had from weight loss. I didn’t ask him to help me. He just did and said I don’t need to pay him back. Now I feel stuck. I took the offer because I felt like I’d just given up everything, yes please make an investment back into me. 

I had surgery and was supposed to be very low activity for 4-6 weeks

I didn’t do dishes or sweep or laundry for a few days and he had a meltdown over the state the house was becoming. I started doing all the chores again (I cook every single night from scratch, clean, dishes, sweep, mop, changed out garbages, laundry, wash and fold. He says he’s responsible for outside, fixing, taking garbage to dump)

I started doing all the chores again, and I had several complications where I needed to emergency meet with my surgeon twice because of over strain. I was scared of making him mad, and he wasn’t helping at all or offering. 
After the second wound opening, he said “don’t lift a finger. I’ll be the muscles”. Well guess what? There’s been laundry baskets sitting unfolded for 5 days, we’re sleeping in a mattress cover because he won’t put the sheet on (I’m scared to move my arms like that) the dishes pile up, and I’m still cooking dinner and dishes and sweeping and mopping.  

But now the surgery is over, my cats are gone, my heart is broken, my stuff is in the landfill, I am… a shell of the person I was when I first met him. 

I don’t get affection. He winces when I try to kiss him or get close with him. He keeps everting surface level. He won’t tell me about his past. He won’t ask about mine and said he doesn’t want to know.
Everything is surface level
I am lonely. I’m so lonely. But I keep gaslighting myself, like he spent so much money on me that he didn’t necessarily have to just throw around, he’s trying to show love I guess? But I’m so fucking empty. I want him so bad. I want all of him and for him to want all of me. I’m so empty. 

Am I hallmark? Am I too needy? Am I expecting too much? He has said “I’m a grown fucking man” a few times when I bid for connection. He said what he looks for in a a woman is someone who’s sweet, calm, loving, supportive. 

I am all of those things, but when you want a woman like that, she’s going to be affectionate and starve for some connection. That’s part of what makes her sweet and supportive. 

I constantly just want to go beg for my cats back and move into my parents. But I keep holding this hope he will snap out and love me more. Am I wanting too much from a grown “real” man?

The last bit of context is that he was disowned by his mom at like 13 and never had a dad. ",2,1757035172.0,AskMenAdvice,10,0.75,False

I'll try to briefly explain my situation for context -- I'm an engineering student (20M) at Cal Poly SLO who's thinking of transferring to UCB in Fall of 2026, and due to a unit-cap limitation for students transferring into the UC system (if you take too many course units, you become ineligible for transfer, to the best of my knowledge: [UC's transfer credit policies](https://admission.universityofcalifornia.edu/admission-requirements/transfer-requirements/preparing-to-transfer/transfer-credit.html)) I'm taking, potentially, a whole academic year off to live in the Berkeley area, work on transfer applications, and try to immerse myself in the community. There are so many things to like and dislike about SLO, but at the end of the day, I grew up in the area (\~5 minutes from the Cal Poly campus!) and feel that I need to put myself in a space where I can grow differently. Berkeley has always appealed to me as a place where I can learn to be a person in the world, get inspired by all of the amazing work being done there, and feel like a part of a new community. 

That said, I have a couple of questions for anyone in-the-know who's willing to share some advice:

First, I'll be in Berkeley tomorrow (9/5) through Saturday (9/6), and would love to see some of the Berkeley Engineering facilities while I'm up there. Does anyone know of a way I could visit some the machine shops, labs, etc.? Also, I'd happily take any recommendations for resources (admin/engineering centers/general student services/professors/counselors etc.) that you've found helpful, or even just random things you think are cool around campus. I'm open ears. 

Second, what's housing like up there? Is it extremely competitive to find a place to live during the academic year? Does anyone know of any places I should look into -- or avoid? If anyone had a lead on a place to stay \~October 2025 through \~Summer 2026 and felt inclined to PM me, you would be my hero. 

Third, how possible is it that I could get involved with other Berkeley students in things like clubs / events / sports / etc. during my time there? I know -- I'd find it strange if a non-admitted student was strolling my campus, too -- but I'd hate to spend my time up there without being involved, in some way, with students my age, even though I won't actively be taking courses and, all things considered, have no guarantee of being admitted to Berkeley at the end of the year. Who knows. Is this somewhat normal or completely unheard of? 

I realize this is a lot to ask, and please don't feel obliged to answer each and every one of my questions. If I walk away from this post with just one tip or recommendation, I'll be happy :) 

Last thing -- if anyone is on campus tomorrow or Saturday and feels like, after hearing my situation, they could share some useful advice, or connect me with someone, or show me some of the engineering facilities, feel free to PM me! I'd love to buy you a coffee and hear what you have to say.

I am no stranger to Brenda’s sense of vision, that’s why I brought her on board just days before Greg and I cooked up the scheme for County Fence 2.0. Brenda and I had crossed paths at various local political meetings where I greatly admired her passion. Sensing that perhaps she was lacking a platform, and I staff, I offered what I could: a position as Napanee Correspondent here at County Fence.

Gentrification is a hot topic in these parts lately. Of course, most long-time locals don’t use that language. Rather they see it as an invasion from the city: thousands of families selling million-dollar fixer-uppers in one place and descending on what they see as an idyllic blank canvas just a few hours away from all that is familiar. And Brenda Hogg is a critic on the forefront of this change.

Realistically my parents’ generation was the last great rural-Canadian generation. Over my lifetime there has been a slow exodus from the countryside as industries centralized and rural economies mechanized. There has been a great schism in our fair country where those seeking to make a name for themselves generally leave while those seeking stability remain. And today, like a perfect secret fishing hole discovered by the piscatorial masses, the machinery of that exodus has slowed and lurched into reverse.

As someone who appreciates fine things, I’ve been divided. Among some circles that I’ve been privileged enough to have gained entry my tastes are decidedly humble but I’m also a lifelong believer that a life well-lived is bespoke. For instance, County Fence HQ is a simple bungalow not entirely different from those up and down Ms. Hogg’s own street. Yet through efforts of my own and craftspeople I respect it’s finished to a high and custom standard. I have always felt that resources spent on lifestyle creep are wasted but, as the venerable Mari Kondo proclaims, your possessions exist to bring you joy.

On the other hand there is a heady freedom that comes with a rustic lifestyle. Recently I visited our very own Gregaro McKool’s homestead: a lovely cottage in the midst of receiving some much needed and expert TLC. He was in the middle of moving a large chest of drawers down a hallway with vintage pine floors which left a rather noticeable gouge in the finish. Had these been new and pristine floors there would have been much weeping and gnashing of teeth but given that they’re due for a refinish anyway he was able to shrug it off and head to the kitchen for some delicious coffee instead. When he does refinish, it will be with oil rather than urethane because keeping soft pine floors pristine is a fool’s errand and a luxurious patina is the correct recipe for cozy living.

A picture-perfect lifestyle leaves little room for grace or comfort while a neighbourhood with a few weeds and a bit of flaking paint is an invitation to authenticity, to let one’s hair down and relax. Yet these things on one single house indicate an eyesore. In the end it’s about priorities. Those who have prioritized ambition have largely gone elsewhere while those who have prioritized a slower and perhaps more stable lifestyle have remained. Now that those high-achieving people are returning with half a million dollars in their renovation fund the ones who have remained don’t stand a chance.

Of course I stand between these two groups: when I had my opportunity to leave I opted to stay, like Ms. Hogg. I liked the fresh air too much and enjoyed enough privilege to have my cake and eat it too. I knew that if I wanted to see a balanced community someone needed to stay behind and invest, to be the change they wanted to see. But, alas, I still wanted change.

Truth be told I’ve wished there was a little more colour on streets like Brenda’s. A holdover from the puritanical utopianism of colonial opportunists, there are only a handful of traditionally accepted house colours in these parts: white, pea green, white and pea green, brick, and timber. In the nineties we added beige vinyl siding to the mix as well. To my mind the joy of paint is that it’s relatively cheap and needs to be reapplied periodically: why not chose something bold? But perhaps those who prioritize boldness were the ones who looked for their opportunities elsewhere.

Of course Brenda Hogg did not look for opportunities elsewhere, she had other priorities. A burning passion for her community and an independent spirit lead her to invest in her town even if that meant less opportunity. From the home that she inherited from her parents she was able to secure the freedom required to be unapologetically herself. And who is that person? What self is able to be expressed in the privacy of that early-2000’s box-store privacy fence? Walter insists it’s the heart of an artist, though I wonder if it’s not something more performative. Perhaps the heart of a muse.

Given the beautiful day, Brenda received me in her back yard: a private oasis of creatively potted plants and whirligigs. Most, if not all, were thrifted or found at various flea markets. Many had been repaired in creative and endearing ways. She served me the rural Ontario drink of choice: rye and ginger in some delightful 1970’s vintage plastic floral tumblers. We soaked in our surroundings from a charming picnic table with a stylish pub style patio umbrella that I’m sure was acquired legally, upstanding citizen that Brenda is.

It’s easy to loose sight of your culture in small communities, especially ones that haven’t enjoyed the economic privileges others have. An insecurity develops that causes one to either cling to what they already posses or the things their neighbour possesses. A classic example might be Canada and the United States. Arguably we have the healthier and perhaps more multi-faceted culture but it’s obscured by the sheer amount of culture that an extra century of history, ten times the population, and the Hollywood culture-making machine can output. Thus we find ourselves envious of a country without socialized healthcare, deep racial inequality, and among the poorest social mobility of developed nations. Canada is arguably reaching maturity as a nation at this very moment but could hit a self-imposed ceiling rooted in the insecurity we feel in the presence of our southerly neighbours. The same thing happens in the small communities in our region: their identity becomes so reactive-to and thus dependent-on nearby large urban centres that a healthy individual culture is not cultivated. The path forward is blazed by people like Brenda Hogg.

It’s rare for Brenda to leave Napanee, which shows serious commitment. Being such a small community this imposes limitations on her curatorial abilities but I am a firm believer that constraints breed creativity in the same way hardship breeds culture. Yet her endeavours to preserve her parent’s mid-century way of life and celebrate what her community has celebrated over time remind me of my own efforts to preserve the home I grew up in. Following the death of my mother it was my wish to preserve the Octavian family homestead according to the period in which it would have been at it’s most authentic. Beginning life like so many as a traditional Ontario Cottage before being added-on to, I felt it was a unique way to preserve how my people lived. Over the years it has not only provided overflow sleeping accommodations for large groups but also a filming location for a few period dramas. Where I intend to preserve a turn-of-the-century lifestyle, Brenda does the same for the mid-century.

At my stage of life it’s easy to forget your age and become excited about the new hot thing. I am constantly impressed by the creativity and confidence young people show these days and the possibilities technology makes possible. The fact that Ms. Boardman can develop software out of the back of a van while exploring the furthest reaches of the North American road network is truly astonishing, and I must admit that I am jealous. But that’s a young man’s game and I must remember that I am no longer a young man. Those days are behind me and I’m thankful for kindred spirits such as Brenda with which to remember and preserve the past.

*A practical guide to understanding and nurturing those who excel while struggling with inner doubts*

---

## Recognizing the Pattern 🔍

We all know someone like this. They consistently deliver exceptional results, meet every deadline, and often exceed expectations. Yet behind their impressive achievements lies a constant worry about not being good enough. These individuals work harder than necessary, seek excessive validation, and live in perpetual fear of failure despite their track record of success.

This behavior pattern appears everywhere - in families, offices, sports teams, and social groups. Understanding how to support these valuable yet vulnerable individuals can transform both their experience and your relationship with them.

## Understanding Their Inner World 🧠

The high-achieving anxious person operates from a unique mindset. They've learned to equate their worth with their output, creating an exhausting cycle where each success only raises the bar higher. Their achievements become both their strength and their prison.

**Key characteristics you might observe:**
- Perfectionism that delays completion
- Seeking reassurance after delivering quality work
- Working longer hours than necessary
- Difficulty accepting praise or compliments
- Intense fear of disappointing others
- Comparing themselves unfavorably to peers

## Creating the Right Environment 🏡

### In Family Settings

**Celebrate the person, not just the performance** 💝
Instead of focusing solely on grades, promotions, or achievements, acknowledge their effort, creativity, and growth. Comments like ""I'm proud of how you handled that challenge"" work better than ""Great job getting an A.""

**Establish worth beyond accomplishments**
Regularly express appreciation for who they are - their humor, kindness, or unique perspective. This helps them internalize that their value exists independent of their productivity.

**Model healthy boundaries**
Demonstrate that rest, mistakes, and imperfection are normal parts of life. Share your own learning experiences and how failure led to growth.

### In Professional Environments

**Provide specific, actionable feedback** 📊
Vague praise like ""good job"" doesn't help anxious high-achievers. Instead, offer concrete observations: ""Your analysis of the quarterly data revealed three insights we hadn't considered, which directly influenced our strategy.""

**Set realistic expectations**
These individuals often assume you want perfection. Explicitly communicate what ""good enough"" looks like for different tasks. Help them understand that not every project needs to be their masterpiece.

**Create psychological safety**
Encourage calculated risks and normalize mistakes as learning opportunities. When they inevitably make errors, respond with curiosity rather than judgment.

## Communication Strategies That Work 💬

### The Power of Preemptive Reassurance

Before they even ask, provide context about expectations. ""This presentation doesn't need to be perfect - we're looking for your initial thoughts to guide our discussion"" prevents hours of unnecessary anxiety.

### Reframe Their Self-Talk

When you hear negative self-assessment, gently redirect their attention. If they say ""I probably messed that up,"" respond with ""What specific evidence makes you think that?"" or ""What would you tell a friend in this situation?""

### Acknowledge Their Feelings Without Dismissing Them

Avoid phrases like ""don't worry"" or ""you're being too hard on yourself."" Instead, try ""It sounds like you're feeling uncertain about this project. What support would be most helpful right now?""

## Practical Daily Approaches 🛠️

### Morning Interactions
Start conversations by asking about their well-being before discussing tasks or deadlines. This signals that they matter beyond their productivity.

### During Projects
Check in about their process, not just progress. ""How are you feeling about this approach?"" shows interest in their experience, not just the outcome.

### End of Day
Acknowledge what they accomplished, however small. ""You made real progress on that analysis today"" helps them recognize incremental achievements.

## Building Their Confidence Over Time 📈

### Document Their Successes
Keep a record of their achievements and positive feedback to share during moments of self-doubt. External perspective helps when their internal voice becomes unreliable.

### Gradually Increase Autonomy
As trust builds, give them more independence in decision-making. Start with low-stakes choices and gradually expand their authority.

### Connect Them With Others
Introduce them to colleagues or friends who can provide additional perspective on their abilities. Sometimes hearing praise from multiple sources helps it sink in.

## What NOT to Do ❌

**Avoid competitive comparisons**
Never use phrases like ""Why can't you be more like..."" or highlight others' achievements as motivation. This amplifies their tendency toward harmful self-comparison.

**Don't ignore their anxiety**
Pretending their concerns don't exist or dismissing them as ""silly"" breaks trust and increases isolation.

**Resist the urge to over-praise**
Excessive or unearned compliments feel hollow and can increase their skepticism about positive feedback.

## Long-term Relationship Building 🌱

### Consistency Matters Most
Small, regular gestures of support outweigh grand occasional efforts. A brief daily check-in builds more trust than an elaborate monthly recognition ceremony.

### Patience With Progress
Change happens slowly for anxious high-achievers. Celebrate micro-improvements and expect setbacks as part of their growth journey.

### Focus on Relationship, Not Results
When they trust that you value them as a person, their performance often naturally improves. The relationship becomes the foundation for everything else.

## Creating Lasting Change 🔄

The goal isn't to eliminate their drive for excellence - that's often their superpower. Instead, help them achieve their high standards while maintaining their mental health and relationships.

**Encourage self-compassion practices**
Suggest they treat themselves with the same kindness they'd show a struggling friend. This simple shift can transform their internal dialogue.

**Promote work-life integration**
Help them find activities and relationships that provide fulfillment beyond their primary achievement area.

**Model the behavior you want to see**
Demonstrate healthy responses to stress, failure, and criticism. Your example often speaks louder than your advice.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

Supporting anxious high-achievers effectively creates positive change that extends far beyond the individual. Teams become more collaborative, families grow closer, and everyone learns healthier ways to pursue excellence.

These individuals often become the most grateful and loyal team members once they feel genuinely supported. Their combination of high standards and deep appreciation creates lasting positive relationships.

Remember: you're not trying to fix them or eliminate their drive. You're providing a safe space where their natural talents can flourish without the exhausting weight of constant self-doubt.

Your consistent support helps them discover that they can maintain their high standards while also enjoying the journey and valuing themselves as human beings worthy of respect and care.

The investment in understanding and supporting these remarkable individuals pays dividends not just in their improved well-being, but in the stronger, more compassionate community that emerges when everyone feels truly valued.

---

*This approach works because it addresses the root cause of their anxiety - the belief that their worth depends entirely on their performance - while honoring and channeling their natural drive toward excellence.*

I think if Viktor really wants to make the full commitment, he should dress Jayce up in like a cow costume and make him get on all fours in the grass like on his front yard so that he can be all embarrassed, and then Viktor can just squeeze his titties, just milking him into a bucket. 

Viktor has enough to make like a fatass wheel of cheese and sell it. Or keep it for himself. 

I do think that with being malnourished, Viktor could potentially benefit from drinking Jayce’s breastmilk. 

My grandma got shot and cannibalized. 

Y’know what? I don’t even think Viktor would milk it into cups. I think he’d just drink it straight from the tit.

I think Viktor and Mel only get along when they’re sucking Jayce’s nipples. 

And they like do it so often, it’s not even a sexual thing anymore. They just suck his titties out of habit now. Two cups each. 

I bet Viktor likes to extract Jayce’s breastmilk and put it into his coffee. Just to lighten it up.

1n8rlhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1n8rlhc/i_dont_know_how_to_feel_about_my_friendships/,I don’t know how to feel about my friendships,"Some backstory: Over a month ago I moved out from living with my two friends (Cece and Dede). I met Cece back in school (2 years ago) while Dede I met through a mutual (3 years ago). I then introduced Cece and Dede which they immediately became close friends last year.

My romantic relationship of 4 years was draining me so l decided to move out and move in with Cece & Dede. When we were moving in, we had to last minute accept a 2B1B apartment (we all paid the SAME amount in rent). I had to then share a room with Dede because Cece did not want to share rooms with anyone.

Disclaimer: I always knew Dede had issues with hygiene and cleanliness so I hoped with open communication they would be considerate.

Once we moved in, Dede had issues of leaving unpacked boxes in common areas so we would need to remind Dede to clear out the area. Two months in, we collectively helped Dede to unpack and clear out the common areas.

Eventually Cece had a private conversation with Dede how they need to do their part and maintain the shared room clean since my mental health is impacted by the environment. Dede's response was ""I'm trying to survive every week, I'll do my best but my priority is to get by each day"". Dede would not respect my side of the room. They would leave clothes on my bed and on my desk. Or if they were going out and I was at my ex's place, I would come home to their makeup on my desk. Since we shared closest space, I would see their items spilling over to my side. Dede would overfill the closet so much that the door wouldn't close all the way.

I also should've known better about Dede. One time Dede asked to use my phone's light to check their dog's leg and when their dog twitched, they threw my phone to the ground (which cracked my screen). Dede explained they threw my phone as a reaction from watching their dog's leg twitching. They didn't apologize...

Eventually Cece began to contribute to the mess. Cece would cook and leave the kitchen a mess from the night before. The sink was always filled with dishes that were days old. Both Cece and Dede would leave items on the dining table but wouldn't put them away. The common room's closet was filled to the brim with both their items and I would hardly have room for my items. The restroom was also messy from hair being all over the counter and on the floor. There would be mucus in the sink and the bathtub always had hair trapped + it was becoming pink. We had tiles and anytime I would walk barefoot my feet would turn dark from all the dirt and dust. Cece and I would then have private conversations regarding Dede's cleanliness especially since Dede owned a dog. Cece brought up the point that Dede allowed their dog to rest on the couch. The couch was becoming a whole different color. So Cece and I spoke with Dede about buying a coach cover or respectfully having the dog off the couch. Dede did not do anything about it but continued to have their dog on the couch. Instead it was me and Cece who were innovative and used a bedsheet to cover the couch. Dede ALWAYS slept on the couch which left me and Cece to not really enjoy our common areas. Since our living room was directly in front of the kitchen, I also couldn't do my morning routine (make coffee or breakfast) since Dede worked a later shift and I didn't want to wake them up + the kitchen was a mess.

I am an early bird. I had work at 7AM and needed to be asleep by 9pm. Cece and Dede had a similar work schedule so they would stay up until 2AM-3AM. I was constantly being woken up by them laughing and screaming. When I confronted them about their noise level the following day, Dede explained how ! should've texted them the moment they woke me up and moving forward I should text them since they at times get too playful and forget.

Cece's and Dede's friendship would become closer. Eventually Cece would stop talking to me about their private life and wouldn't put any effort to hang out with me. Anytime I would hang out with Cece, Dede was always involved. Apparently Cece ended their relationship and only told their closest friends. I only found out through one of their friends accidentally slipping up and telling me. I didn't ask Cece about their personal life since I saw no effort on their end so I kept conversations surface level.

I started to feel burnt out living with them. Since my relationship with my ex was better I found comfort in spending time at their place. I would spend 3-4 nights at their place since their environment was a lot cleaner and organized.

Another issue would arise, which was that we all owed each other about 4 months worth of I.O.U's. Cece and Dede were persistent with coming together to do finances. Although majority of the time it was me having to propose time frames. We all agreed on a time and it was common for Cece to flake (for example go to the gym or store and come back at a later time). I would then have to stay past my bedtime to ensure we get our finances done. Eventually I confronted them about being more accountable for our finances and no rescheduling the session so often (as this creates a longer I.O.U). Cece disagreed with me and said their priority is not finances since ""life happens"". Eventually we were able to pay each other back.

When the end of the lease was approaching, I had to make a decision of signing another lease with them or moving out. Financially I knew I couldn't move out on my own so l decided to move back in with my ex since things were better and coexisting in the same environment with them required no energy from me. I was internalizing the decision and I had spoke with my closest friend about it. She supported my idea. Eventually I knew I had to come out clean.

Then one night at a house party, Cece confronts me about us starting our search for a three bedroom apartment. I shut down but I tell them the truth how l don't plan to move in with them. Cece shuts down in front of me. We then go home and we talk. Unfortunately I was emotionally a mess. I was drunk and sleep deprived so I felt as if this decision would ruin our friendship. I explained how this decision wasn't easy and how I felt like it was something I needed. They then told me ""is this who your forever partner will be?"" And they began to ask questions with how moving in with my ex would help with my growth. They also told me how they wished the moment I had a thought of not living with them that I should've told them (they never checked in with me). Then they told me to check in with them in two weeks with a solid answer. Two weeks passed and I gave them the answer. I explained that I needed an environment that is more organized and calm. Also that I'm not moving in with my ex because I want us to work out, I'm only doing it for financial reasons and since their environment is what I need. They both claimed to have supported my decision. I told them three months in advance.

Until I hear Cece talking about me to our other mutuals on a livestream. Cece is explaining how I handled telling them about my decision was not the best and how ridiculous it is for me to move back in with my ex. I then pull Cece aside and confront them. Cece apologizes not for talking about me but for doing it on a livestream. Cece stated that they wanted to talk to our mutuals to help process it. Cece then tells me I should check in with Dede. Dede then tells me how I was moving weird for months since I held in my decision. Dede then explains how theyre also processing the decision and wishes they would've told me earlier so they could start game planning (I told them three months in advance). Dede then explains how theyre scared of becoming homeless to which I breakdown and explain I would never let that happen so l offer my help with apartment hunting. Cece and Dede then claimed to have forgiven me with how I handled telling them.

Then Cece and Dede begin to apartment search but are not keeping me in the loop (not that they needed to but it was more for me to assist them since they made me feel concerned about them going homeless). I then had to constantly check in with them to see how they were doing. At this point I felt like I was intruding in their dynamic so I accepted the fact that I am simply not as close to them as they are with each other and I’m okay with that!

I learned through this experience how I allowed myself to become small so they can have as much space as they needed. I had allowed myself to become a doormat. I put my needs aside because I would overhear or be told that Dede & Cece were going through it (and I mean every week they were going through something tragic). So i didnt feel safe enough to speak up. Not to mention, when speaking to them, majority of the times, it feels like they gang up on you. Thoughts? Opinions?",1,1757033970.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I’ve never dated before, never kissed anyone, nothing. So I was nervous but curious, and I asked him pretty early what his intentions were. He told me he was looking for a serious relationship, not something casual, which was reassuring.

We’ve had two dates so far and honestly I’ve been thinking about him since the first date.

Date 1: We met at a local coffee shop and ended up talking for a couple hours. At the end, he actually asked if I was free either later that day or the next so we went bowling right after! It felt really natural, and I was surprised at how easy it was to spend that much time together right away.

Date 2: He picked me up (he offered to pick me up earlier than planned and said he was excited) and we went for drinks and planned to go to the cinema after but we ended up talking for so long that we missed the start of the movie so we just went for food instead. He made sure the place wasn’t too loud at the restaurant, asking the waiter to turn down the radio behind us so we could actually hear each other. Later, when he dropped me off, I asked for a hug since I was going on holiday and wouldn’t see him for a couple of weeks. Hug was slightly awkward in the car, but then he shyly asked: “Do you want more?” and leaned in slowly for a kiss once I nodded my head. It was my first ever kiss and I kind of blurted out afterwards that it was my first, rambled, then bolted out of the car but he was really sweet about it.

Since then, we’ve been messaging daily while I was away. I even told him I want to take things slow, and he responded that he really likes me and that he’s happy to go at whatever pace I’m comfortable with, and that he’d never want me to feel pressured.

We’ve got another date planned to walk around a castle (he said if it rains we can hide in his car 😭) and he’s also suggested watching The Nightmare Before Christmas together since he’s never seen it.

I’m new to all of this so I don’t know if I’m just overly excited, but it feels really good so far. He hasn’t complimented my looks directly, but my friends say the kiss is proof he’s attracted to me.

We are long distance, but have already met once during our relationship, and intend to meet again soon. We have also discussed the potential of her moving here to me, should things go well. I really like her, and we have so much in common but the last week has REALLY cast doubt on this whole thing.

Firstly, she’s a lot more controlling than I’d like, and I wasn’t expecting that. I have a lot of female friends, that I used to talk on the phone with and stuff, but she told me she didn’t like that so I respected her opinion and I stopped. I also stopped sending TikTok’s/memes to any of my girl friends. It really came to a head when she sent me an Instagram post of a friend of mine that I liked. It was an entirely innocuous photo, and was in fact a collage post with several photos of her dog, the beach, etc. nothing sexual, revealing, or suggestive at all. I DO NOT and have never followed IG models or OF girls and generally if someone I follow starts posting super sexual stuff I usually unfollow them. But this was literally a very innocent post. My girlfriend instantly said “you lied to me when you promised you wouldn’t like random girl’s photos.”

The girl whose post I liked is a friend of mine for nearly 15 years. I grew up with her. I get coffee with her. I work with her. I thought nothing of liking the post, and still hold that opinion but to appease my girlfriend I unliked it and told her I wouldn’t like any more of her posts. 

After that things got okay for a while until recently. She’s started getting very anxious about our relationship, seemingly afraid that I’ve lost feelings or that I’m going to leave her. Shes suddenly started saying I don’t put in as much effort as I did a month ago, and that I’ve changed. The issue is, I genuinely haven’t. I am no different than I was a month ago and I still do everything nearly the same as I did. When she tells me these things, I don’t know how to respond other than by telling her that I haven’t changed my feelings and that I don’t see what she means. I still reassure her and I still try to comfort her, but she’s brought it up every day for the past week. I’m growing tired of it and now it might actually be effecting how I act.

My fear is that there is a vast incongruency with our maturity levels, and I don’t know if this is something that can be worked past. I don’t know if I can handle a relationship if it continues like this. But we’ve only been together for a month, so I don’t know if it’s too early to call it off. I also really do not want to hurt her. I’m stuck. 

Does this seem salvageable? Or am I digging myself into a deeper hole?

Edit: to clarify, I’ve met this girl many times and have been friends for years, but we’ve only met once since we started dating.",1,1757033822.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False
