1k5xq0k,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k5xq0k,"First time fast, my experience.","hello there, I wanted to share here my experience in my first ever fast. The original motivation behind this was weight loss. I was on shift and having a hard time breathing while wearing my plate Carrier when I came across a post of someone losing weight via fasting.
I found this interesting as before I usually had times where I worked out and lost weight, but would then gain it all back and then some. The lowest I ever saw was 235lbs during the pandemic when I was training for corrections. Few years later and I'm sitting at 300lbs and miserable. 
After seeing that post I decided to just dive right in, no prep, no nothing, just a dream. Straight water fasting with some sparkling water. 

Day 0: first half was not too difficult as I still had some food in me, but once past the 12hr mark did the hunger pangs start to hit, and it was brutal. I like to eat a lot, but usually whole foods, no junk food or pop, and this came back to bite me.

Day 1: getting past the initial 24hrs was a mental challenge and required a lot of self discipline. This was not easy and rolling hunger pangs came and went. By now I lost the food weight and most of the water weight, and found myself feeling light and could breathe easier. Working midnights, I sleep through most of the day so the hunger didn't bother me as much.

Day 2: oh boy was this day crazy. While the hunger became muted my cravings and desire for food shot through the roof. I started negotiating with myself to just eat some food and try again later, order delivery, devour a whole cheesecake(I really love cheesecakes). Thankfully I bought some packs of sparkling water and this really help take the edge off enough to stay in control. I sometimes found myself mindlessly swiping to Uber eats before catching myself. 
Did some more reading on the subreddit wiki and learned more about keeping electrolytes which explained some of my symptoms (completely forgot about this)
Also something I discovered and saved myself from disaster is DO NOT TRUST A FART, IT IS A LIE. thankfully got home in time.

Day 3: decided to end my fast this day as I felt it was a good first time mile stone and next time properly gear up and do my research for the next one. To break fast, I had some broth and then an hour later light scrambled eggs with a small coffee. Thanks to you guys I learned the broth tip. What was interesting is my body felt like it refused to eat and getting that first bite was difficult, but good lord did it taste amazing. After reading others stories I get it now. 

Results: In total I lost 4.6 pounds. After getting past the hunger, fatigue, and into autophagy I started to feel great. Mind was much clearer(after some electrolytes/snake juice/taste awful), and the world has a noticeable increase in vibrancy(probably placebo or something idk). All in all it was definitely worth it. Feels like I got a full reset. 

Question for y'all. I'm wanting to do Keto/fasting moving forward. Any tips/advice on what foods to eat, stuff to prep before beginning a fast? I've read a lot of different opinions, but I want to hear yours.

1k5xl9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ninebot/comments/1k5xl9g/ninebot_es2_tires_replacement_saga/,Ninebot ES2 tires replacement saga,"I wanted to leave this post as a reply to this thread  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/ninebot/comments/1igjgl7/old\_ninebot\_es2\_strange\_shutdown\_cause/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninebot/comments/1igjgl7/old_ninebot_es2_strange_shutdown_cause/)  
But I decided to make new thread because of sheer amount of experience one can obtain from this story.

Long story short - I decided to change tires and something went terribly wrong. This one is long-read, so fasten your seatbelts.

Couple days ago I decided to replace tires again - the summer is calling, and I also was able to find good stock-alike tires online - like these ones:  
[https://www.amazon.com/GYL-Inch-Ninebot-Front-Tire/dp/B0CPSWQGMF?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/GYL-Inch-Ninebot-Front-Tire/dp/B0CPSWQGMF?th=1)  
Unlike Chinese cheap tires with perforation (for example [https://www.amazon.co.uk/8x2-125-Ninebot-Segway-Electric-Scooter/dp/B0CDBRTWWY](https://www.amazon.co.uk/8x2-125-Ninebot-Segway-Electric-Scooter/dp/B0CDBRTWWY) ) these ones are much harder, last longer (around 2000 km is good result IMO) and look just like the original ones. The cheap soft ones will turn slick after 3-4 month in my experience. I also decided to replace throttle resistor - it started to jam a little. And front fender also needed replacement.

Now there is a common way to replace tires - you take the wheels off, disassemble the front one and remove old tires. Then you boil new tires in water to make them softer, apply some silicon grease or just soap and pray to Jesus that you have enough strength and that rubber became soft enough so you could stretch the new tires onto the wheels. There are several tutorials on youtube that cover this theme.   
But not in case of these stock-ish tires.  
As I said before, these ones are much denser and harder to stretch - boiling will not really help.   
To put them on you will need hydraulic press. The manual hydraulic press with lever for pressing bearings will be sufficient. It's not a problem to gain access to one if you have friends from local car repair shop. And as I said before, my brother is mechanic, so I had one on mind.

Putting on rear wheel tire is much easier than the front one. All you need is to distribute the pushing force evenly. It can be done with special adapter for really large bearings or just that cross-shaped wrench for car wheel nuts. But adapter or just big round steel plate will do the job better. The small pinch bar or crowbar or even claw-hammer will also be helpful to control how exactly tire fits on wheel.  
The rear wheel is made from plastic. It can bend a little for some extent, but it actually is pretty hard to brake.  
Now, you put tire on press table, put plastic wheel on top of it - as centered as possible - then put adapter/steel plate on top of it and start to push it. If everything is done the right way - it will eventually start to go inside tire. You can even try to boil/heat up in thermal cabinet the tire to simplify the process, but in case of rear wheel it's not really needed.  
You need to control how evenly the core goes inside the tire and help it with pinch bar. If you are using manual press like I did - it will not be a problem. Just remember - safety first. Don't try to help the core go inside tire with your bare hands! Only use tools!  
Eventually you will be able to push the core inside almost entirely. Now remove the wheel from press and finish the job with mallet. Tap the wheel evenly around with it. Make sure that it sits well just like it needs to be from factory. It fits really tight now.

The job is done. You re-weared rear wheel. At least I whish you so =)  
The front wheel is just another story. It consists of two main parts. First one is the rotor that... well... rotates. It's an aluminium alloy (something close to silumin/AlSiL alloys) housing that holds the tire and has magnets inside.  
The second one is stator - it consists of motor anchor, windings, hall sensors and sensor PCB and hollow wheel axle through which wires from windings and sensors pass.  
The axle is attached to the rotor through one bearing, and the cover is put on the other one from the opposite side, all screwed with 6 hex-head Inbus or flat undercut head with six-lobe tamper torx (HATE!HATE!HATE!!!111) - it depends from wheel model.  
There are two wheel variants - one has magnets with length around 3,5cm and fatter motor anchor. Another one has 2,5cm magnets and thinner anchor. The shorter magnets one is, for example, WB36V25H model. It's black one with inbus screws. This one can be easily obtained from aliexpress and is used for old kick-sharing ES2 variants and as ES4 common replacement wheel. The stock grey one was bigger magnets.  
Also, I can be wrong a bit here - in my opinion, both variants behave almost identically and there's almost no difference. It's said that newer ones are 350W and stock is only 300W. But in reality, I'm not 'Speed-racer' guy and I see almost no real difference. It's only 50W and it will not take you to the moon.

First thing to do is to unscrew 6 bolts that hold cover. The cover sits now on sealant. Well, it's meant to sit on it, but the amount is so small that in my opinion it will not prevent any water from going inside anyway. And in practice there are always some oxidization inside after a year or so with stock sealant. It can turn realy nasty like it was when I bought mine. So, prepare some good silicone sealant to cover this issue in the future.

Then you need to detach rotor and stator parts. The rotor magnets are strong, so it will be hard for unexperienced person. You will need rubber mallet to do this. –°lamp the wheel horizontally in a large vice or at least between your legs so that it is held wires side of axle down securely, but so that nothing prevents the metal cover from freely coming out. In some case the bearing already sits loose on axle or on cover and cover can be easily removed - try it just in case, but don't use too much force. The AlSiL alloy is not as rigid as it seems to be. Especially in case when your wheel is old as hell as mine. While it can't bend very well, it can become very brittle to fracture with time. And this is foreshadowing for what will happen in the future =) Don't try to detach it with too much force and don't use pinch bar on it unless you know what you are doing. You can make it crack or even break it if you are not lucky.

Now, no matter if you detached the cover or not, hit the non-wired side of axle with mallet. Don't be afraid here - you will not break it. Either the axle will start to slip out of both bearings, or only the top one - one way or another, the motor halves will start to separate. The magnets are strong and they will pull them together back. The key here is to put something, that is NOT your own fingers between the halves while they are detached. I use two 7mm thick steel bars. Don't put them too deep, by the way. You don't want to screw motor windings and hall sensors.  
You can put the wheel non-wired axle side on the floor and try to push it down until you are able to spread halves far enough to separate them completely. If you have big vice - you can try to clamp the part of the axle with wires in a vice and pull the rotor (outer part) of the wheel. But it's also hard, and you need to be sure not to damage axle thread with vice.  
You can actually pull the stator outside from rotor by wires - they are actually pretty robust. But DON'T OVERDO IT. You need some experience to do it this way, and it's dangerous. I can do. You can't. I never told you this method =) If you did so - check wires for shorts and breaks, check inductance, check hall sensors. Be sure that you didn't broke anything.  
Hall sensors can be checked with any magnet and simple schematic like this one:  
[http://www.trainelectronics.com/artcles/Sensors\_Part\_II/images/hall\_schematic-1.JPG](http://www.trainelectronics.com/artcles/Sensors_Part_II/images/hall_schematic-1.JPG)  
You can search for wheel disassembly tutorials online - there are other ways to do so, and I'm not an expert here. I do it in the way most suitable for me.

Now you have separated wheel - the rotor external housing with magnets and tire and stator part with axle and windings. Back to hydraulic press. The story is the same - we need to push the stator inside new tire.  
As i said before, the key here is load distribution. Unlike rear wheel plastic aluminum alloy can be bristle. It will not forgive you if you just push the wheel inside new tire by applying the force on center of it. The aluminum is thin in this area and can start to crack, break, and be pushed through with hydraulic piston.  
It was my error here. I forgot to add 'linearization plate' between piston and rotor and broke my wheel:  
[https://imgur.com/a/vACtb99](https://imgur.com/a/vACtb99)

Full stop. A lot of dirty swearing. Denial. Anger. Bargaining. Depression. Acceptance. Couple of cigs and a mug of coffee in search for quick replacement.  
To prevent this situation it's necessary to find or make an adapter for the press piston so that the piston presses not on the center of the rotor, but evenly along its perimeter, where the aluminum alloy is thick and cannot break. If you are planning to replace many tires - you can even order from a lathe operator one made of 0,5-1cm steel. I had one big brass cap for some sort of barrel or container that had diameter of a bit less than 140mm that I planned to use for this task. But i simply forgot to do so and broke my wheel.

Lucky me! I quickly found the suitable replacement. One guy sold me half-broken wheel with dead hall sensors. It was fully intact from the inside, and the only problem was with flux-less soldering of one of sensors. So, I actually got myself almost-new (less than 100km) wheel and it cost me about 10 times less than a new one. I repaired halls, rechecked wires and windings and decided that this one doesn't need tire replacement for now. 

So, if you are more clever then me - you were able to press rotor inside tire without any problems. Now you have an opportunity to clean everything from water and oxides - the magnets and anchor can get pretty rusty, use toothbrush and appropriate cleaner. I use cleaning liquid for carburetors, flux-off, soap, DeOx and a lot of F-words in process. Again, don't screw with windings. Damaged winding = dead stator = dead motor. I'm 99% sure that you will not be able to rewind your motor at home. And if you are able - you don't need to read this thread =)  
I also apply a thin layer of thick grease such as solidol or lithol on metal surfaces to protect it from water. But before it everything must be made clean and dry like baby's ass in fresh diaper.  
I also did it with my newly-fixed wheel. Then I use sealant gun to apply silicone sealant on rotor parts that contact with wheel cover and assembly everything back together - put stator in rotor, put cover in place, screw all 6 inbus bolts back with a bit of locktight, straighten the tire with rubber mallet around the wheel so that it sits as tightly and evenly as possible, connect and test it, then let it dry for 1 day or so.

Throttle replacement is boring and simple, so as front fender. Nothing bad happened here.

So. Don't make my mistake! If you don't want to mess around - just buy cheap tires and put them on with boiling and soap.   
If you want to mess around - mess around and find out =) But you will need manual hydraulic press and a way to distribute the pressure evenly.

1k5xkyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teeth/comments/1k5xkyz/constant_tooth_sensitivity_got_me_down_found/,Constant Tooth Sensitivity Got Me Down - Found Something That's Actually Helping,"Anyone else out there deal with that annoying zing of tooth sensitivity? For me, it was triggered by everything ‚Äì hot coffee, cold water, even just breathing in cold air sometimes. It made enjoying food and drinks a bit of a minefield, and I was constantly on the lookout for ""sensitive teeth"" toothpaste, which honestly only provided temporary relief, if any at all.

I'd been to the dentist multiple times, and while they ruled out any major issues, the sensitivity persisted. They recommended the usual sensitive toothpaste and being gentle with brushing, but it felt like I was just managing the problem, not really solving it.

Then, I stumbled upon a discussion about oral health that mentioned the role of the oral microbiome in things beyond just breath. Someone mentioned that an imbalanced oral environment could potentially contribute to enamel issues and sensitivity. This was a new concept for me, and it led me to look into products that aimed to support a healthier oral microbiome.

That‚Äôs how I found Prodentim. The idea of using probiotics to create a more balanced environment in my mouth, rather than just trying to block the pain with special toothpaste, felt like a different approach worth trying. I was cautiously optimistic, as I'd tried so many things before.

Here's what I've experienced after using Prodentim consistently for a few weeks:

* **A noticeable reduction in sensitivity.** This has been the biggest win for me. I can now enjoy my morning coffee and a cold glass of water without that sharp, uncomfortable zing. It's made a real difference in my daily comfort.
* **My gums feel healthier overall.** I've noticed less occasional redness or irritation, which I sometimes attributed to the sensitivity issues.
* **My breath also feels fresher.** While sensitivity was my primary concern, this has been a nice added bonus.
* **It's incredibly easy to incorporate into my routine.** Just a chewable tablet after brushing. No extra steps or fuss.
* **It's not an instant fix.** It took a couple of weeks of consistent use before I really started to notice a significant difference in my sensitivity.

So, if you're also struggling with persistent tooth sensitivity and haven't found long-term relief with traditional methods, here are a few takeaways from my experience:

* **Consider exploring the oral microbiome.** It might be playing a bigger role in your sensitivity than you think.
* **Be patient and consistent.** Give a product like Prodentim time to work and support a shift in your oral environment.
* **It's a simple addition to your daily routine.** If you're looking for a low-effort way to potentially address the root of the problem, this is worth considering.

I found more information about Prodentim and the specific probiotic strains they use on their official website. If you're curious about their approach and want to see if it might help with your tooth sensitivity, you can check it out [here](https://theprodentim.com/text.php?aff_id=833843&subid=redditstoryrevsubredtoothtxt).

1k5xkek,https://www.reddit.com/r/VestibularMigraines/comments/1k5xkek/vestibular_migraine_triggered_by_pregnancy_anyone/,Vestibular migraine triggered by pregnancy? Anyone else?,"I‚Äôm 35, heathy and 18 weeks pregnant. Uncomplicated thus far apart from typical nausea/vomiting/heartburn. 

Woke up yesterday morning and felt fine until I stood up and then BAM vertigo. Felt like I was on a boat - like I was swaying and everything was moving. Nausea as well. Tried to sit down and it improved a bit, but felt like I was going to throw up so got back into bed.

When laying down in bed - immediately resolved. If I lay on my right side totally fine. On my left side I notice maybe a slight hint of vertigo but super minor, no nausea. Even attempting to sit up in bed a little bit though to drink some water - severe dizziness, couldn‚Äôt tolerate. 

Ate some fruit and drank some water whilst laying down in case this was low blood sugar or dehydration. Called in sick for work obviously. After 4 hours with no improvement - called my husband and asked to go to hospital. 

Seen by neurology and everything normal except when he put these blackout goggles on me he noticed:

‚ÄúWith occlusive ophthalmoscopy (the goggles that make everything black but they see your eyes on a camera) subtle left beating nystagmus. Positional downbeat nystagmus with Dal-Halpike testing left and right. Onset 1-2 seconds, lasting ~1 minute more intensely but persisting even after this. There was a subtle upper pole left torsional component as well in addition to the left beating seen upright. Upon return to sitting there was a few beats upbeat nystagmus before settling back into the left beating. A deep head hang was completed but following this no change to the nystagmus‚Äù

The rest of my neurological exam was totally normal. 

Doctor told me this was probably a vestibular migraine, less likely to be BPPV but could be crystals in the anterior canal. 

I have had migraines before but never very severe - mild light sensitivity and a specific throbbing headache for me, maybe 1-2x a year. I‚Äôve had a sensory aura with NO headache during a really stressful 2 year period (numbness that spread down my arm  and then a tingle in the lip) but this resolved when the stressor went away. 

They have ordered a MRI which I should hopefully get in the next 2 weeks - he said this is just a precaution to rule out any other causes, the most concerning one being a cerebellar stroke given I am pregnant and this can happen! 

The dizziness seemed to become less severe after about 6 hours. By the 12 hour make it had 90% resolved. I then did get a headache, similar to my migraines - however I also skipped my coffee that day which also gives me a headache so hard to tell. Went to bed and woke up this morning feeling fine - although now super atune to any dizziness and definitely over analyzing things! 

Has anyone had their migraine present during pregnancy? He said the hormone changes can make this happen. Also a bit freaked out about the nystagmus - it‚Äôs scary when you google causes! Anyone else have this? ",1,1745410259.0,VestibularMigraines,0,1.0,False

1k5xgj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/OralNutra/comments/1k5xgj2/dealing_with_morning_breath_gum_annoyances_what/,Dealing with Morning Breath & Gum Annoyances - What I've Learned After Weeks of Trial & Error,"Alright, so for the past couple of months, I've been on a low-key mission to tackle this persistent morning breath thing and those occasional gum sensitivities that pop up out of nowhere. It's honestly been a bit of a frustrating journey. I've tried a bunch of the usual suspects ‚Äì different toothpastes claiming miracles with their whitening or ""deep clean,"" various mouthwashes that just taste like chemicals and leave that weird artificial feeling, and even upped my flossing game to the point where my gums were probably begging for mercy. You know the drill ‚Äì you see a new product with promising claims, you shell out the cash, and then...meh. Most of it felt like I was just throwing different solutions at the wall and hoping something would stick.

Then, I stumbled across this product called Prodentim. It was mentioned in some online discussions I was lurking in about oral probiotics, which was a concept I hadn't really considered before. The idea of using ""good bacteria"" for your mouth sounded a bit out there at first ‚Äì I mean, we're always told to kill the bacteria in there, right? It felt counterintuitive. But the more I read about the oral microbiome and how imbalances can lead to issues, the more intrigued I became by this different angle.

So, naturally, I figured I‚Äôd test it out. At first, I was definitely skeptical. Another supplement promising the world? My wallet has seen that movie too many times. But the approach felt different enough, focusing on building a healthy environment rather than just masking symptoms. I decided to commit to using it consistently as directed and see what happened.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown of my experience, the good, the bad, and some things I didn't quite expect:

* **It definitely made a noticeable difference with my morning breath.** This was probably the most immediate and significant change. It‚Äôs not completely gone (let's be real, that might be a mythical creature), but it‚Äôs significantly milder and less... alarming. My partner has definitely noticed a difference too, which is a major win in my book.
* **The gum sensitivity has improved.** This was another big one for me. I used to get that sharp twinge when I had anything really cold, like iced coffee, or sometimes even when brushing too vigorously. While it hasn't vanished entirely, it does seem to flare up less frequently and feels less intense when it does. I can actually enjoy a cold drink now without that immediate discomfort.
* **What surprised me was the subtle shift in how ""clean"" my mouth feels throughout the day.** It's not that super-artificial, sterile clean you get from a strong antiseptic mouthwash that fades after five minutes. This feels more like a balanced, natural feeling of freshness that lasts longer. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but my mouth just feels‚Ä¶ healthier.
* **One thing I wasn't expecting was the taste and texture.** The chewable tablets have a slightly minty, almost creamy taste that's actually quite pleasant. They dissolve easily and don't leave that chalky or weird residue that some supplements can. It's actually become a little ritual I don't mind.
* **On the 'missed the mark' side, it's not a quick fix.** You definitely need to be consistent with it for a few weeks to notice any real changes. I didn't see a dramatic overnight transformation. If you're looking for an instant cure for a sudden bad breath episode, this probably isn't it. It feels more like a gradual improvement from the inside out.

So, what are my actionable takeaways after this little experiment?

* **If you're considering trying Prodentim, give it a solid month of consistent use before you make a judgment.** Don't expect miracles in the first few days. Let the probiotics do their thing over time.
* **Don't expect it to replace brushing and flossing.** This feels more like a supportive addition to a good, fundamental oral hygiene routine. It‚Äôs not a magic bullet to skip the basics.
* **This might be particularly helpful if you've tried a lot of surface-level solutions for persistent breath issues or mild, recurring gum discomfort without much success.** If you're looking for a different approach that addresses the underlying oral environment, this could be worth exploring.
* **For those who are generally interested in the gut-mouth connection and the idea of a balanced microbiome, this approach might resonate with you.** It aligns with the growing understanding of how important our internal ecosystems are.

Because I tend to overthink these things, I ended up looking into Prodentim a bit more. If you're curious and want to check it out for yourself, you can find more information on their official page [here](https://theprodentim.com/text.php?aff_id=833843&subid=redditstoryrevtxt).

I could argue the percentage of bullshit on certain specific tasks can be a bit high, but overall it isn't completely pointless. 

Then generative AI happened and execs got super excited about gains in productivity or whatever. I got put into the working group that develops gen AI wrapper tools for internal use. I'm not on the tech/dev side, I'm supposed to represent the user expertise side of things.

The tools don't work. I mean, they do, but with like a 50% accuracy for stuff you can't afford any mistakes on and even when they do get it right, it's still not directly exploitable and you need to double check. Everyone knows it, so part of my job is also to organise webinars to teach people how to use them and gaslight them into believing that these things work great. Sometimes I ask for feedback without necessity, like over a coffee or something. Just because people's honest and less than flattering thoughts about these tools help me to ""ungaslight"" myself - the best I heard so far was that one minor functionality is kinda cool to experiment with, but apart from that it's only complaints. Within the work group, any criticisms are recieved with ""if AI gave perfect results, people would complain that they're getting replaced. When it does a bad job - what do you expect, of course it needs human control. Productivity gains tho, right?"". (Wrong, in case you're wondering)

Re: Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness

Mr. Secretary,

You can re-establish a $10 billion dollar recreational fishing industry in the United States.

We respectfully request that you facilitate a Presidential Executive Order ending the overharvesting of a critically important forage fish, Atlantic menhaden, by a Canadian company, in US waters. Striped Bass, as well as Bluefish, Weakfish and other economically important predators of Atlantic menhaden, are dependent on menhaden for their survival. The last remaining industrial harvester of Atlantic menhaden is Omega Protein, a Canadian owned company that processes Atlantic menhaden for its foreign aquaculture operations and pet food operations.

Unfortunately, the US Government has been ignoring the law which is resulting in a devastating decline in the recreational harvest of Striped Bass and other sportfish. The GDP associated with the recreational harvest of striped bass along the Atlantic Coast alone was $7.7 billion dollars in 2016 ($10.2 billion in 2025 dollars). There were also over 100,000 jobs associated with this industry. Since 2016, the striped bass and other recreational harvest has declined by 50%, resulting in billions of dollars of lost revenue and thousands of jobs. This has represented a ""Canada-First"" policy.

The solution to this problem is to end all industrial reduction purse seine harvesting of Atlantic menhaden in US waters.

I respectfully request that you facilitate a Presidential Executive Order ending all industrial reduction purse seine harvesting of Atlantic menhaden in US waters.

With Respect and Gratitude,

Very Respectfully,

Phil Zalesak, President, Southern Maryland Recreational Fishing Organization

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best sugar free squirty creams boast a combination of factors that contribute to their overall appeal. These include taste, texture, ingredients, ease of use, and storage. Analyzing these features helps consumers understand the nuances of each product and determine which one best suits their needs.

**Taste Profile:** Achieving a delicious taste without sugar is a significant challenge. The top sugar free squirty creams utilize various sweeteners, such as erythritol, stevia, or sucralose, to mimic the sweetness of traditional whipped cream. The success of these sweeteners depends on their ability to provide a pleasant flavor without any artificial aftertaste. A good sugar free squirty cream should offer a balanced sweetness that complements the accompanying food or beverage, avoiding any chemical or bitter notes.

**Texture and Consistency:** The ideal sugar free squirty cream should have a light, airy, and smooth texture, similar to its sugar-laden counterpart. This is often achieved through a combination of ingredients and pressurization. The cream should hold its shape well when dispensed, without collapsing or becoming watery too quickly. A stable texture is essential for creating visually appealing and palatable desserts or toppings.

**Ingredient Composition:** The ingredients in sugar free squirty cream are crucial for both taste and health. High-quality options prioritize natural or low-calorie sweeteners and avoid artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives. Common ingredients include cream, water, nonfat milk, stabilizers (such as carrageenan), emulsifiers (such as mono- and diglycerides), and the chosen sweetener. Some brands also incorporate natural flavors like vanilla extract to enhance the overall taste.

**Dispensing Mechanism and Ease of Use:** A user-friendly dispensing mechanism is essential for convenience and portion control. The nozzle should allow for smooth and consistent dispensing without clogging or sputtering. The can should be easy to grip and handle, even with wet hands. Additionally, the dispensing mechanism should minimize waste and ensure that the remaining cream stays fresh for as long as possible.

Key features of the best sugar free squirty creams include:
*   Authentic taste without artificial aftertaste
*   Light and airy texture
*   Use of natural or low-calorie sweeteners
*   Easy-to-use dispensing mechanism

 ## FAQs Section

Navigating the world of sugar free products can often lead to questions about their ingredients, usage, and impact on health. Addressing these frequently asked questions can help consumers make informed decisions and fully appreciate the benefits of sugar free squirty cream.

**What Sweeteners Are Typically Used in Sugar Free Squirty Cream?**
    Sugar free squirty creams typically utilize alternative sweeteners to replace sugar. Common choices include erythritol, a sugar alcohol; stevia, a natural sweetener derived from the stevia plant; sucralose, an artificial sweetener; and monk fruit extract, another natural option. Each sweetener has its own taste profile and impact on blood sugar levels, so it's essential to check the ingredient list and nutritional information to choose a product that aligns with your preferences and dietary needs.

**Does Sugar Free Squirty Cream Affect Blood Sugar Levels?**
    Most sugar free squirty creams have a minimal impact on blood sugar levels, especially those using sweeteners like erythritol and stevia, which are not metabolized by the body. However, it's crucial to consider the overall carbohydrate content of the product, as some formulations may contain small amounts of carbs from other ingredients. Individuals with diabetes should always monitor their blood sugar levels after consuming any new product to ensure it aligns with their management plan.

**How Should Sugar Free Squirty Cream Be Stored?**
    Sugar free squirty cream should be stored in the refrigerator at all times, both before and after opening. This helps maintain its texture and freshness. It's also important to follow the expiration date on the can to ensure optimal quality and safety. Once opened, the cream should be consumed within a week or two to prevent spoilage.

1k5x9ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1k5x9ap/hand_grinder_recommendation_for_both_light_roast/,Hand grinder recommendation for both light roast espresso and pour over? [No budget],"Hi everyone,

I recently upgraded from my Lelit to a Decent Espresso Machine because I was struggling a lot with temperature stability. I use a Niche Zero, which works great for me since I mostly drink darker roasts. But lately, I've been wanting to experiment more with lighter roasts and also occasionally enjoy a filter brew. Since I won't do that too often, a hand grinder is perfect, as I can store it away and don't have to give explanations as to why I had to spend even more money on coffee stuff lol

To explore that, I‚Äôve already ordered the Filter3 basket for the Decent to try some brews. However, I‚Äôm also looking for a suitable hand grinder that can help me in two specific ways:

1. Produce a grind fine and consistent enough (with low fines) for light roast espresso
2. Be capable of grinding coarse enough for methods like pour-over or French press
3. Flat burrs (?)

I know there are a lot of hand grinders out there, and I‚Äôve watched a bunch of videos (including some from Lance), but to be honest, I‚Äôm feeling overwhelmed and more confused than when I started. Especially 1Zpresso and their weirdly similar named lineups confuse the hell out of me.

I don‚Äôt want to buy two separate hand grinders ‚Äî one for filter and one for espresso. So I‚Äôm looking **for one that can reasonably do both**. My budget isn‚Äôt unlimited, but I‚Äôm more interested in the best price-to-performance ratio than anything fancy or stylish. I‚Äôve read a bit about flat burrs being better in some cases, but I‚Äôm not sure if that applies here.

Would really appreciate any recommendations or insights you can offer. Thanks a lot in advance!",1,1745409323.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

Chapter 1

CAMILLE'S POINT OF VIEW 

Three years. One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary.

I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered.

My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart.

""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike. He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials.""

My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?""

""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out.""

The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger. Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine.

""Is there someone else?""

The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes.""

One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect.

""How long?""

""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes. ""She came back to town and...""

""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?""

""I didn't want to hurt you.""

A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you.""

My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor. Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit.

""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels.

""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now.""

I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee.

The world stopped.

I knew that smile. Those eyes. That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve.

""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?""

Stefan's silence said everything.

Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy.

My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille.""

""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to...""

""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic. ""How long were you together before? Before me?""

He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London.""

Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him.

""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece.""

""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you.""

""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods? Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?""

Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away.

""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce? Planning your next wedding?""

""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better...""

""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people.""

I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose.

""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly.""

I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking. Let them think they'd won.",1,1745409179.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

\[USER 3 CONTINUED\]

\[UPDATE\]

I‚Äôm writing this as I wait for the man to wake up. I went to a warehouse last night, I was desperate and willing to do almost anything to get a normal night of sleep. When I walked through the doors two people were just inside and demanded to know what I was doing there, a third joined them and that‚Äôs when I recognized their shirts as being the same as the creature that the hunter killed, I tried to babble some excuse about a bathroom when the door slammed open and I turned just in time to see the hunter raise his shotgun and fire.

I ran with the sound of gunshots and yelling behind me, I found myself in a room at the end of the hall with no way out. I went to close the door when I saw the hunter running towards me. The man is dangerous but obviously so are the things he‚Äôs hunting, so I waited for him to run through before slamming the door shut.

I had never been attacked or shot at or seen any of that happen before, there were monsters and yelling and it was all too much. Then I saw a crack begin to form on the back wall, or maybe it was always there. As I watched it grew, white light pouring out and eyes floating to the surface looking around the room, at the door, at the hunter, at me.

People started jumping through the broken door and the hunter was trying to stop them but it was clearly a losing battle. I looked back to the crack in the wall and saw all the eyes were staring at him. If I don‚Äôt do something we‚Äôre both going to die, maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. As one of the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù reached into the hunter but only managed to pull out a rib I reached him and pulled as hard as I could to get him to the crack of light.

The eyes and light covered his head like a fly's face, he stumbled and the attackers seemed to hesitate until he raised his gun and shot another one. He spewed a blinding white liquid over another that disappeared after a few seconds leaving the upper body burned and dissolved with just a few tendons holding the remaining bones together. The fighting didn‚Äôt last long after that and once it was done the whole mass of eyes and light fell upwards into a crack in the ceiling and let the hunters body drop to the ground.

He was still breathing and I couldn‚Äôt find any obvious injuries but that doesn‚Äôt mean much when your bones can be taken and eyes melt people. As I was trying to figure out what to do next someone else walked in, the good news is it wasn‚Äôt trying to kill me but the voyeur was still unsettling to see in person. He drove me home and helped me move the hunter inside.

My dreams were nightmares but not prophetic, which is a relief all things considered. I woke up first, the hunter is breathing normally now and I think he‚Äôll be alright, I‚Äôll let him sleep for a while longer before trying to wake him. I gotta get some better curtains for the windows.¬†

\[USER 5 CONTINUED\]

\[UPDATE\]

I was raised Christian but slid into Agnostic fairly quickly, just playing the probability game it was clear to me that something was out there weighing the dice in our favor but I had no idea what, still don‚Äôt I guess. There‚Äôs no end of holy books and interpretations and variance so up until last week I just chalked it up as, ‚ÄúGod is probably real, I don‚Äôt know which one or what he wants, so I‚Äôll play it safe and just try to be a generally good person.‚Äù But last week, seeing that thing, actual unnatural evil, if things like that are out there then I know exactly what God wants from me.

Finding Marthas charity was more difficult than I thought it would be, it never told me where it was and the logo was too unoriginal and vague to show up on an image search, I asked around some of the kitchens, ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt seen her in a few days and am getting worried‚Äù, which was technically true, and one of the organizers pointed me in the right direction. I took note of the entrances, possible exits, number of people entering, and the wiry looking man walking up to my car.¬†

I tried to bluff him off but he started showing me photos of far more people in those logo shirts than I had seen along with ordinary looking people standing around nearby. I invited him in to sit with me and began digging for details, the more he explained the more I saw how these people didn‚Äôt look right. He followed these things here just like I did and was better at this surveillance thing than me, he didn‚Äôt freak out or get excited when discussing best paths in and timing, and he had way too many pictures of people in their homes to be a cop.¬†Also if he were a cop he would know not to stare, I swear he blinked twice the whole time we were talking.

I got the call last night, arrived before the ‚Äúothers‚Äù finished gathering, the plan was to wait for the attack to start then I‚Äôll go in and clean up, camera man would keep an eye out and talk to me on radio. Eight of the others had gathered when someone not in the group walked right up to the front door, she didn‚Äôt look inhuman, she looked panicked. Camera saw her too and confirmed she was very much human and walked right into what was about to be ground zero. Odds of success weren‚Äôt great already, far outnumbered against creatures I don‚Äôt understand, getting the jump on them after they do most of the work for me was the best bet. But you know, fuck it, if this was a suicide mission anyway I‚Äôd rather do it without feeling guilty for letting someone die to improve my odds.¬†

I hit the front door at a dead sprint, four sets of eyes on me became three with a round of buckshot and the woman started to run, I got another round off as she moved out of the way but not a third before I was hit with a tackle. The 9mm wasn‚Äôt enough to stop them outright but the gutshots were enough for me to break loose and follow the woman down the hallway, a peek behind me showed two more turning the corner to chase and gutshot standing back up, I was able to holster the 9mm and get one more shot off of 12g before running through the open door which the woman slammed shut after me.

Camera was in my ear telling me the others were moving in, I pushed an old desk in front of the door to buy some time as fists starting putting holes in it. It was hard to hear details through the earpro but after the attacks on the door stopped and I could hear snarls I stood on the desk and started taking shots through the massive holes. The plan, if you could call it that, was to shoot whoever seemed to be winning to make things easier for me later. Not complicated and not particularly effective either, the others had the numbers and my introduction gave them an advantage, a few of them carried their own guns which after a few near misses convinced me to give up my position on top of the desk.

The sounds of fighting ended and we were fucked, maybe a dozen things were now focused on the poorly barricaded room at the end of a hallway with no other ways in or out. They didn‚Äôt give me any time to take this in or check up on the woman who was facing the wall with a thousand yard stare, as I traded shots with two at the end of the hallway the rest rushed the door. I got the gunmen and a couple of the things jumping through the now splintered door but I got hit in the chest by one and felt the most bizarre combination of pain and absence. Then the woman pulled me back and my world went into a white flash.

It felt like a dozen dogs were leashed to my optic nerves pulling in different directions and for each pull I had a new set of eyes to look through, all separate but overlapping. A killer headache, burning sensation going down my spine, and a dozen views of things trying to kill me didn‚Äôt leave me with any time to understand what was happening, I chose the pull of one to lead me with the shotgun and put down the one that hit me, switched to the pull of another that felt focused on the next nearest assailant and vomited on it. Sort of. It felt like throwing up but from the back of the head instead of the stomach and out the eyes instead of the mouth. Whatever happened it was unpleasant to do and seemed to have great effect on whatever it landed on.¬†

Fighting against the pulls was possible but difficult and painful, it was much easier to pick one that I agreed with and lean into it before switching to the next urging, none of them wanted to crawl over the desk but once I dragged them onto it most of them chose new actions to pull to and made things easier again. I shot, vomited, and even headbutt a few more things before they could escape and all at once the barbed net on my mind tore itself forward through my eyes and I passed out.

I woke up in a studio apartment to the smell of coffee and chainsaw blurring of my vision. I was bruised and tired and had a wicked headache, but at least that broken rib wouldn‚Äôt be bothering me anymore. The woman was quite nice now that she was calmed down and talking, and once my vision cleared up, quite good looking too. Anyway she‚Äôs been seeing visions or something that led her to the warehouse that night and convinced her that pushing me into the blinding eye pile was a good idea. She was very apologetic about the whole thing but it‚Äôs the reason we survived so I couldn‚Äôt really hold it against her.¬†

We traded numbers, I went back to my car, and that‚Äôs that. Some detective left a business card on my windshield but since it wasn‚Äôt impounded outright I‚Äôm taking this as a good sign. I‚Äôm giving you guys this update before I call, if they want to arrest me I‚Äôm already in too deep with the whole basement thing and going on the run just isn‚Äôt who I am.¬†

\[USER 4 CONTINUED\]

\[UPDATE\]

So I got arrested.¬†

I was just doing my thing, watching the warehouse, watching the things watching the warehouse, when I spotted someone else, a person. The other things watching are all mask, they have no true behaviours, they shiver when it‚Äôs warm, don‚Äôt react to rain, even saw one smoke a cigarette for hours when the lighter didn‚Äôt work. Parked down the street was a rust bucket jeep with a real person in it, they took pictures of the warehouse and its surroundings, they turned away and pretended to look at their phone when someone walked past. This person was real and they were watching the warehouse, just like me.

They didn‚Äôt have my focus though, they were here to do something, not watch. I was conflicted, if they moved too quickly they might get in before the big confrontation kicked off and I wouldn‚Äôt be able to watch, from his position he can‚Äôt see the masks, but on the other hand that‚Äôs his business and I didn‚Äôt feel like getting involved. In the end I decided to talk to them, it was also the right thing to do I guess. He was a little jumpy and swore he was only there to pick up their girlfriend but became a lot more open when I showed some of my pictures.¬†

The plan was pretty simple, once the masks make their move we‚Äôll let them maul each other and buddy will move in to clean up the scraps, he‚Äôll wear a camera and an earpiece, I‚Äôll see it all. Simple but sounded solid enough. Shame it didn‚Äôt work out.¬†

The masks started showing up one by one and gathering around the corner, buddy arrived before they made their move, the cameras were charged and the moon provided a good amount of light. Then some woman walked up to the warehouse. She looked scared and confused and walked right up to the front door. I told buddy I‚Äôve never seen her before and she was definitely not one of them, he swore a lot and ran in early.¬†

After the first shot the woman ran and buddy followed her down a hallway, the whole mass of masks outside turned and ran at once into the building, so kinda the opposite of the plan. I didn‚Äôt have any cameras inside the warehouse except buddies, so all I could see was two people that locked themselves in a room while all the exciting stuff was happening behind the door. Sitting there with all these cameras pointing at nothing while everything is happening just a few hundred feet away, god that was painful and I almost didn‚Äôt make it.¬†

Before I broke and went inside the fighting ended, in the masks favor since they were the things that ran through when the door came down. Buddy was fighting but not doing great, then he fell backwards and the camera went white. By the time the footage cleared buddy was on the ground and the woman was freaking out about his fall, which told me the fighting was over and I missed almost all of it. I was pretty frustrated about that but whatever, these things happen, I drove up to the entrance and walked in to help out.

Some of the bodies had holes, some were torn, some looked totally fine but had their insides laying next to them, and some looked like they stood in front of a jet engine. I had things to do so I only took a few pictures. The woman flinched when I walked in but otherwise helped me move buddy to my truck, she jumped in too so I just started driving, I don‚Äôt think she bought my excuse of visiting relatives but she gave me her address anyway and I helped move buddy into her apartment before going home for a nap.¬†

The next day all my cameras were offline and a drive by revealed several cop cars in the warehouse lot. Not great. Later that same day two officers stopped by my house and arrested me. I was in some sort of solitary jail for two days before they let me out, I was told not to take any trips and that they‚Äôll be in touch for more questions, the bastards kept all my photos though. I drove by all the dens but the doors were covered in police tape, one of them still had a cop car parked out front and after only thirty minutes or so two cops walked out, one of them was buddy. Kinda fucked up that he never told me he was a cop but nice of him to get me out of jail.

Anyway that‚Äôs all I guess. If I can‚Äôt find any more creatures to watch I‚Äôll go back to birds and people. I miss it already.",2,1745409128.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

I get up, go for coffee and come back and start doing things around the house.  I've lived in my current home for over twenty-five years.  Needless to say I know all of my neighbors.  Some are friendly, some are neutral and some are not.

This morning as I pulled out of the driveway to get coffee it was raining pretty hard.  We have an overnight parking ban on the street, which the city claims to support.  Yet we have a member of the town board who parks his vehicle on the street almost every night.  We have a main road that intersects with our street and the cars turning off that road are usually going between 35-50mph.  Because of this person parking on the street vehicles tend to turn wide entering the street to avoid him.

Well this morning one SUV did just that, they came wide around the turn, slid in the rain and ploughed into a ditch, hit a pole and drove over a tree.  Yet, as soon as they saw me, they turned off their lights, reversed out and drove past me sticking their finger (yes, that one) out at me.

I called the police and reported the accident and the cause of it.  The police told the property owner that they didn't know who had caused the damage.  Yet, they have a description of the driver, a video of his car and the car parked illegally and his license plate.  Later today when one of the officers shows up in his wife's car instead of his own SUV I doubt anyone will care.

# APRIL 23rd, 2025~Bad News for China: Rare Earth Elements Aren‚Äôt That Rare

**China is limiting US access to critical minerals in response to President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs, but the move isn‚Äôt as devastating as Beijing wants it to be.**

[Bad News for China: Rare Earth Elements Aren‚Äôt That Rare | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/rare-earth-minerals-china-tariffs/)

[President Trump ordered a probe on April 15, 2025, that may result in tariffs on critical minerals, rare earth metals, and associated products such as smartphones, in an escalation of his dispute with global trade partners.Photograph: PATRICK T. FALLON\/Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/v2zrju2uhkwe1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb03ae9bc2c1750161e88fe1bb038df8e0e6dc39)

As¬†[the trade war](https://www.wired.com/story/china-tariffs-response-trump-retaliation/)¬†between China and the United States continues to escalate, Beijing is responding by turning to one of its favorite retaliation tactics: limiting the export of critical minerals used in many¬†[high-tech electronics](https://www.wired.com/story/2-obscure-clean-energy-metals-are-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-us-china-trade-war/), from fighter jets to wind turbines. While China‚Äôs mineral restrictions may sound scary, the reality is that they haven‚Äôt been very effective in the past and stand to become even less so if the US and other countries finally get their acts together.

It all started in July 2023, when the Chinese government announced it would restrict the export of gallium and germanium, two critical minerals that are mostly used in making¬†[solar panels](https://www.wired.com/story/tandem-solar-panel-cells-efficiency-energy/)¬†and¬†[semiconductors](https://www.wired.com/story/taiwan-makes-the-majority-of-the-worlds-computer-chips-now-its-running-out-of-electricity/). Over the following two years, China‚Äôs list of controlled products expanded to include antimony, graphite, and other materials. Earlier this month, the Chinese government escalated things even further, subjecting seven rare earth elements to a more comprehensive export licensing program that covers the whole world and is designed to further choke off American companies.

Rare earths are a subset of elements under the broader umbrella of critical minerals that China has long enjoyed monopoly control over. In the short term, companies that need these rare earths might be able to rely on existing stockpiles or even turn to recycled electronics to find them. But eventually, the US and other countries will be forced to either ramp up domestic mining or reduce their dependence on rare earths, both of which would make China‚Äôs policies sting less. ‚ÄúChina has got one shot, and it knows it,‚Äù says Ian Lange, an associate professor of economics and business at the Colorado School of Mines.

# Rare but Not Irreplaceable

The export controls China announced earlier this month cover samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium, and yttrium‚Äîseven elements that belong to what is known as the rare earth family. They are called ‚Äúrare‚Äù not because of their scarcity but because they often are mixed with other mineral resources and can be hard to separate out.

There are 17 rare earth elements in total, but the Chinese government chose these seven because they are part of a smaller subset of ‚Äúheavy‚Äù rare earth minerals that the country has more control over than others, says Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. That monopoly was built over decades as China created a robust supply chain for these minerals and the rest of the world turned away from what is a heavily polluting and niche sector. ‚ÄúChina processes pretty much 100 percent of the world‚Äôs heavy rare earths, which means that they don‚Äôt just have a comparative advantage, they have an absolute advantage,‚Äù says Baskaran.

But the other important thing to know about rare earths is that‚Äîwhile they are used in a wide variety of products‚Äîthose items typically only contain very small quantities, and often only in supportive roles. Last year, the United States imported about $170 million worth of rare earth elements, including some that China hasn‚Äôt restricted yet, according to the United States Geological Survey. For comparison, the US¬†[imported](https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=4027&programArea=veg&groupName=Vegetables&commodityName=Potatoes)¬†over $327 million worth of fresh potatoes and $300 million worth of potato chips between September 2023 and August 2024.

Perhaps the most important application for rare earth elements is creating magnets that improve the performance of products like electric motors in high temperatures. These magnets can be found in electric vehicles and consumer products like vacuum cleaners.

‚ÄúThe heavy rare earth elements are added as sort of a spice, a doping agent, to maintain the magnetism of the magnet at high temperatures. It also improves corrosion resistance and the longevity of the magnet,‚Äù says Seaver Wang, director of the climate and energy team at the Breakthrough Institute, an Oakland-based think tank.

Beyond magnets, these rare earth elements can also serve a range of purposes, such as making metal stronger, improving radar systems, and even treating cancer. Without them, in many cases, technological infrastructure and consumer gadgets won‚Äôt be able to perform at the same level‚Äîbut they will still maintain their basic functions. ‚ÄúThe wind turbines will just go out of service 10 years earlier; electric vehicles will not last as long,‚Äù says Wang.

Lange agrees that the impact of losing access to heavy rare earth elements would be somewhat manageable for American companies. ‚ÄúOne place where that rare earth is in your car is in the motors that pull up and down your window,‚Äù says Lange. ‚ÄúThere are ways to just deal with some things that are not as fun, like rolling down your windows by hand.‚Äù

# Loopholes and Workarounds

In the past, China‚Äôs critical mineral restrictions haven‚Äôt worked very well. One reason is that US companies that want to buy rare earth minerals can simply go through an intermediary country first. For example, Belgium has emerged as a possible re-export hub that appears to pass germanium‚Äîone of the minerals Beijing first restricted in 2023‚Äîfrom China to the US,¬†[according to trade data](https://www.stimson.org/2025/chinas-germanium-and-gallium-export-restrictions-consequences-for-the-united-states/). Since the European Union has much closer ties with Washington than with Beijing, it‚Äôs difficult for the Chinese government to effectively stop this flow of trade.

Another sign that China‚Äôs export controls haven‚Äôt been very effective is that the price of critical minerals has increased only slightly since the policies were first implemented, indicating that supply levels have remained steady. ‚ÄúWhatever they did in 2023 hasn‚Äôt really changed the status quo‚Äù of the market, says Lange.

But China‚Äôs latest restrictions are more expansive, and there‚Äôs already some evidence that things could be different this time. Companies that need these elements have been forced to buy them from other firms with existing private stockpiles, which have become more valuable in recent weeks. ‚ÄúThere is a very steep increase in prices to draw down on stockpiles right now,‚Äù says Baskaran, citing conversations she‚Äôs had with rare earth traders.

In the long run, however, companies may be able to find technological solutions to address a potential shortage of rare earth minerals. Tesla, for example, announced in 2023 that it had reduced the use of them in its EV motors by 25 percent, and it planned to get rid of them completely in the future. The carmaker hasn‚Äôt clarified what it would use instead, but¬†[experts speculate](https://spectrum.ieee.org/permanent-magnet-tesla)¬†it could be turning to other types of magnets that don‚Äôt rely on rare earths.

# Where Are the American Mines?

While rare earths, or critical minerals in general, are often cited along with semiconductors as industries the US wants to reshore the most, the challenges associated with bringing each of them back are very different.

# APRIL 22nd, 2025~Analyzing the Impact of the U.S.-China Trade War on China‚Äôs Energy Transition

[Analyzing the Impact of the U.S.-China Trade War on China‚Äôs Energy Transition](https://www.csis.org/analysis/analyzing-impact-us-china-trade-war-chinas-energy-transition)

[Photo: STR\/AFP via Getty Images](https://preview.redd.it/3jlqjtmqjkwe1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&s=997b15af683c31e227b8cd107ae5b149f8b55a52)

The United States and China are locked into an escalating trade war with broad implications for U.S.-China relations, the global economy, supply chains, and global governance. After several rounds of retaliation, both sides have put in place extensive tariffs that jeopardize bilateral trade, and China has introduced new export controls on critical minerals, including certain rare earth metals, among other things. The trade war could impact China‚Äôs and the world‚Äôs clean energy transition. China, the world‚Äôs largest greenhouse gas emitter, is responsible for over¬†[30 percent](https://www.iea.org/countries/china/emissions)¬†of global emissions but is also a clean energy technology juggernaut with record deployment of renewables and electric vehicles (EVs). China also supplies much of the world with EVs, batteries, and solar panels. Consequently, the country‚Äôs progress on its emission and environmental targets has large-scale implications for global trade and investment and the global energy transition.

**Q1: How will trade tensions with the United States affect China‚Äôs energy transition and climate policy?**

**A1:**¬†Unless the United States and China find an agreement to reduce tariffs, trade between the two countries is expected to decline sharply, putting negative pressure on China‚Äôs already stagnant economy. If the government responds with an economic stimulus program that prioritizes industry and traditional infrastructure, as it has in the past, rather than consumption and services, this could lead to a growth in greenhouse gas emissions, making it much harder for the country to meet its own climate goals.¬†[Analysts](https://energyandcleanair.org/publication/chinas-climate-transition-outlook-2024/)¬†already expect China to miss the goals it set for itself on carbon dioxide emission intensity reduction in part due to the post-Covid-19 recovery‚Äôs emphasis on manufacturing.

This year is particularly important for climate diplomacy because countries are expected to announce their 2035 Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) as part of the Paris Agreement. The NDCs were due in February, but most countries, including China and the European Union,¬†[missed that deadline](https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-95-of-countries-miss-un-deadline-to-submit-2035-climate-pledges/)¬†and are expected to submit them in advance of the 2025 UN Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Brazil this fall. With the United States having announced¬†[its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/putting-america-first-in-international-environmental-agreements/), many observers are hoping the European Union and China will take leadership roles at COP30. A negative economic outlook for China may reduce climate ambition further. This would be a negative signal for other countries, and for bureaucracies within China that often look at central government signals for guidance on which policy goals to prioritize.

**Q2: Will U.S. tariffs on the rest of the world affect China‚Äôs energy transition and climate policy?**

**A2:**¬†A second-order effect may come through the impacts of the tariffs on other countries. EU regulation on the emissions of certain goods entering the bloc and other environmental regulations on batteries, for example, are important drivers for expanding efforts to establish reliable carbon accounting mechanisms in China. If the European Union were to further relax regulations to help companies affected by tariffs and an unstable macroeconomic environment, China may also have less of an incentive to clean up its value chains. At the time of writing, the tariffs originally announced on April 2 for the European Union and much of the rest of the world were paused for 90 days and replaced with a blanket 10 percent import duty. However, extra tariffs remain in place for the automotive sector and steel and aluminum, which could have negative repercussions on the already fragile global economy.

**Q3: How will the ongoing trade dispute with the United States impact China‚Äôs clean energy technology industry?**

**A3:**¬†Each sector will be affected differently depending on how dependent it is on the U.S. market. For example, 25 percent of China‚Äôs lithium-ion battery exports in 2024 were headed for the United States (see Figure 1), but exports of electric vehicles, solar panels, and solar cells to the United States are minimal (see Figure 2). However, the United States imports solar panels from Southeast Asia, often produced by Chinese firms with components made in China. So Chinese companies may feel knock-on effects from trade tensions with other countries, or due to increased scrutiny on products‚Äô countries of origin.

It is too early to tell how Chinese critical mineral producers will be affected by new Chinese export controls. The brunt of the impact will be felt by foreign companies whose access to materials such as rare earths may be curtailed or could face disruption due to delays in the¬†[issuance of export licenses](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/business/china-rare-earths-exports.html). However, Chinese firms will presumably also be negatively affected if their foreign exports are curtailed for too long, especially if domestic demand is negatively affected by trade barriers and an economic slowdown.

Internal demand in China will continue to be the most important factor for Chinese producers, and clean energy technology companies are no exception. Important factors to watch are the new¬†[trade-in programs](https://www.csis.org/blogs/trustee-china-hand/your-refrigerator-running-chinas-trade-programs-and-plans-boost)¬†and¬†[low-carbon demonstration projects,](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/china-launches-next-batch-low-carbon-demonstration-projects-fishman-wvufc/?trackingId=cKexgf4XsNpAoVPDfglL7Q%3D%3D)¬†as well as the deployment of solar and wind energy, which is expected to enter a more volatile phase as feed-in tariffs are fully phased out in July. However, a negative economic outlook and increased uncertainty may likely translate to reduced domestic deployment of clean energy technologies. In the long term, reduced deployment could also affect advancements in emerging technologies and research and development (R&D), as companies may have less appetite to invest in riskier projects. In particular, even though the central government may maintain its support for R&D, programs that depend on local government and private corporate budgets may face more constraints. Moreover, any research that involves a partnership with the United States is in jeopardy.

Much of the clean energy technology industry in China is ripe for consolidation, something that the Chinese government itself has signaled it would like to see to counter ‚Äúinvolution.‚Äù An economic downturn is likely to reduce investment and sales domestically but could have a positive effect in the long term if it forces less efficient companies towards consolidation. In practice, this would mean bankruptcy, restructuring, mergers, or buyouts, which, although disruptive, should eventually lead to a stronger and more profitable sector. However, early signs indicate that local governments are already¬†[stepping in](https://mailchi.mp/f003ff0834a0/trivium-china-net-zero-where-did-the-sunshine-go?e=99fa65cd28)¬†to rescue struggling solar panel producers. This will likely exacerbate some of the overcapacity issues that have plagued the industry and that are a consistent irritant in many of China‚Äôs foreign relations.

**Q4: What does the U.S.-China trade war mean for Chinese clean energy technology exports?**

**A4:**¬†The European Union and much of the rest of the world are bracing themselves for an increase in Chinese exports as a result of the trade shock created by the new tariffs introduced by the Trump administration. In the clean energy technology sector, the industry that is most likely to be reconfigured due to U.S. tariffs is lithium-ion batteries, a critical industry that many developed and developing countries are trying to incubate domestically. For example,¬†[some advocates](https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/how-europe-can-use-tariffs-as-part-of-an-industrial-strategy)¬†in Europe have called for higher tariffs on batteries to protect the fledgling domestic industry for some time. A surge of exports of batteries from China would confront the European Commission with the question again, even as it seeks a resolution to tensions with China over EV exports.

Ultimately, China‚Äôs clean energy technology producers are likely to continue diversifying their markets and localizing production where needed to access new customers. Exports of EVs and solar panels to Asia and Latin America have increased steadily in recent years and will likely continue to grow towards markets with lower barriers.

For countries without significant domestic clean energy industries to protect, the trend will be welcome. Cheap solar panels from China have transformed Pakistan‚Äôs energy system, and EV exports from China have put Costa Rica on the map as an electric mobility leader, for example. Europe has increased its imports of solar panels dramatically as it reduced its dependency on Russian oil and gas and struggled with high energy costs over the past three years. And even for countries with their own industrial ambitions, trade with China is not always unwelcome if it can bring more investment. Brazil, a country with no explicit EV adoption targets, has seen rapid uptake in EV sales thanks to several attractive new Chinese models on the market. Brazil is now hoping to become a manufacturing hub by leveraging foreign direct investment from China and elsewhere in the EV sector.

**Q5: What happens if the rest of the world reaches a deal with the United States except for China?**

**A5:**¬†Chinese companies have become very adept at responding to U.S. restrictions by relocating part of their production to new countries. This has been most visible in the solar industry, where value chains shifted from China to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid U.S. tariffs and restrictions through the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. As a result, the United States now imports very few solar panels directly from China, but many of its imported panels are made by Chinese firms or utilize Chinese components.

It is likely that if restrictions on China remain in place as other countries negotiate lower tariffs with the United States, Chinese companies may explore relocating some of their production to other locations. This may be facilitated by explicit efforts on the part of some third countries to attract foreign direct investment to develop a domestic value chain for technologies like batteries.

However, the U.S. government has become far more concerned about the internationalization of Chinese value chains, and scrutiny on Chinese firms manufacturing abroad has increased in recent years. The Trump administration could require stricter rules of origin for countries it thinks may be facilitating transshipment of Chinese goods or for goods made with Chinese components or by companies with Chinese investors. Finally, there is some reporting that the Chinese government itself may be more concerned about technology transfers and leakages in technology for battery technology due to its companies increasing their overseas manufacturing.

Beijing recently asked South Korean companies not to export products containing China‚Äôs rare earth minerals to US defense firms, the¬†*Korea Economic Daily*¬†reported on Tuesday, citing government and company sources.

The report said China‚Äôs commerce ministry delivered the message in letters to Korean companies which make power transformers, batteries, displays, electric vehicles, aerospace and medical equipment, all of which use the key materials.

The letters said Korean companies could face sanctions if they violate the export restrictions, the report said.

South Korea‚Äôs Industry Ministry was not immediately available for comments outside business hours.

Early this month, China¬†[placed¬†export restrictions](https://www.mining.com/china-suspends-rare-earth-magnet-exports-report/)¬†on rare earth elements as part of its sweeping response to US President Donald Trump‚Äôs tariffs, squeezing supply to the West of minerals used to make weapons, electronics and a range of consumer goods.

They would complain about taking a girl out, the costs and all that. I used to feel very bad about that and I am in a career where I make a bit of money. So I would help.


I went for coffee dates, had an entire 3 month relationship where we went halfsies, had a guy once take me out on a date to ask for 300 dollars and my last relationship I spent over 6k flying to him and also helping him.

My brother and I compared notes and I told him, I am the guy in all my relationships. However, instead of being rewarded with love, respect or appreciation, I get poor behavior, sexual boundaries crossed and lack of commitment.

Being in this position has given me an opportunity to see men's revealed preferences as opposed to their stated ones. Here is the truth no one wants to admit.

1. Men are just as opportunistic as women. If you have money and they know it, they will both try to go after you to get it or date you in order to accomplish that. I feel sick when I see a guy's eyes light up when I mention my occupation, I know I'm about to be a walking wallet. 

2. Men's ego cannot handle women outpacing them. Every single man I have ever dated except the ones who were on my level with money or education had some issue with my career. Little comments were cutting: Never put your career above me (after date one). Don't ever think you are better than me(another 2 months in) and my last guy whom I loved ( if I never make money will you ever respect me?--- last one, now that I think of it, broke my heart). I feel penalized for working hard and earning more, almost like society hates me for what I have done. It makes me resentful of the world sometimes.

3. Fifty fifty is failure.
Biology isn't fifty/fifty. I'm on a clock, most men are not. I spend money on makeup, skincare and hair to try my hardest to be somewhat palatable, men are not doing this. I buy lingerie, men just have to show up. If I'm also now paying for flights, dates and at one point a guy wanted me to pay for an exam; then I'm losing out.

Ever since when I was 18, I started working and supporting my family. I support my Mom (48F), my Grandmother (70F), and my uncle (38M). It's been 8 years since I started working and I haven't experience any long vacations or even ""resign"" because my mother doesn't want me to resign. I tried applying to companies with higher salaries but she doesn't want me to leave my company now & she thinks that I am an ungrateful b\*tch because I can get easily distracted because of money. 

I have been working for 17 hrs/ day (2 jobs) and only has 1 rest day per month. I have been paying for everything since 2018 as well. My mom has my savings card & does not give me anything (my salary) because she wanted to handle bills in our home. At first, it was fine with me since I really don't know how to handle money but as I grow older, I realize.. how would I learn if I am not doing it? I tried to bring it up to my mom and called me an ungrateful b\*tch again because I am all about money & does not have any respect to her. (FOR THE CONTEXT: I AM THE ONLY ONE WORKING FOR THE FAM SO I PAY FOR THE ELECTRICITY, INTERNET, WATER, AND FOOD). 

My salary is kinda big. (WORK #1 SALARY - FULL TIME - MOM RECEIVES THEM & WORK #2 SALARY - PART TIME - I RECEIVE THEM IN A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT). But I still buy my toiletries and other things that I need.. so basically.. no savings. Not even allowed to buy the things I like since I also like to go out with my friends and my boyfriend. 

I am trying to save money because it's already summer in the PH and my friends and I wanted to have a vacation in the beach (I TAKE IT AS A TIME FOR ME TO REST). I tried to budget my money and can't afford the trip unless I save & not buy so much food. 

Earlier, my mom asked for my credit card because she'll buy food since it's my late sister's birthday. I told her to save some money for myself because I will be going on a short trip soon and she started yelling at me. She kept on telling that I am very much willing to spend the money with worthless people (MY FRIENDS) and I became stingy to them. She wanted to buy a lot of food for today & she's asking me if we can go to the mall on Sunday. 

I always say yes to her. But I also wanted to go out with my friends because they have become my safe space & I forget all of my problems when I am with them. HOME IS NOT A SAFE SPACE ANYMORE FOR ME. 

  
I am so tired. I am already 25 but she does not let me go out with friends (late night drives or even a trip) unless I inform her a month before. I feel like a child & she often tells people that I am too immature to go out (I DON'T UNDERSTAND HER HERE). I am not even allowed to go out for a coffee on a random day or even go to MY WORKING OFFICE ALONE. 

She always wanted to include herself. If ever there is a saddest person alive right now, I believe it is me. My friends are starting to get married, have kids, get engaged, or just spending time with a partner. I JUST WANTED TO RANT. AND CRY. :(( ",3,1745408296.0,AsianParentStories,0,1.0,False

She became good friends with a gentleman named Herb Shelby who ran a Coffee House called ‚ÄúThe Upstairs‚Äù in Virginia Beach. A few years later, she moved on to spend some time writing songs in Nashville, and continued spending time in the music scene.  As far as I know, everyone associated with it in its youth has now passed on.  I have no provenance for this guitar, but I know who she spent time with back then, and only know it as ‚ÄúCharlie‚Äôs Guitar‚Äù.  I never asked her how it came to be in her possession, as even at an early age, I understood that there are some things about our parents that we children just shouldn‚Äôt know.  It still plays well, the pickups still work, and it sounds great, even with the lifetime of abuse.  I‚Äôm wondering if you guys know of someone to take it to see about restoring it.  It has no distinguishing marks, labels, and likely has no meaning for anyone but me, But I‚Äôd like to see what it would take to treat it like what it is‚Ä¶ which is, at a minimum, a piece of history.",13,1745408251.0,gibson,0,1.0,False

1k5wwlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k5wwlv/can_silonn_slim21_ice_maker_earn_its_place_a/,Can Silonn Slim21 Ice Maker Earn Its Place? A Comprehensive Review,"The **Silonn SLIM21B Ice Maker** earned its place on my kitchen counter shortly after I realized my freezer‚Äôs built-in ice maker couldn‚Äôt keep up with our household demand. As a family of four, ice is vital to our daily lives‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs keeping beverages chilled during dinner or blending smoothies during breakfast chaos. This countertop ice maker boasts a reputation for delivering consistent, rapid ice-making prowess, but of course, every gadget has its quirks. Here‚Äôs my take on its performance based on weeks of continuous use.

**Space-Saving and Practical Design**  
Its compact size was the first thing that caught my attention. Measuring just 8.7"" x 11.4"" x 11.6"", it squeezes into small nooks with ease. I‚Äôve tried tucking it into a corner of the kitchen and even brought it to our patio for a summer barbecue. Its lightweight design‚Äîat only around 13.7 pounds‚Äîmakes it surprisingly portable thanks to the ergonomic carry handle. Whether in our kitchen or camping in an RV, it feels like a practical choice for multiple scenarios.  

**Rapid Ice Production and Storage**  
This little machine doesn‚Äôt disappoint when it comes to speed. After filling the 1.2L water tank, I hit the power button and in about six minutes, voil√†‚Äîfresh bullet-shaped ice cubes, perfect for drinks. It can churn out around 26 pounds of ice in a day, which is excellent for larger gatherings. While it stores up to 1.3 pounds of ice at a time, I do wish the basket was slightly larger. It occasionally feels restrictive, particularly when hosting more than a couple of guests.  
[Check Silonn SLIM21B price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0c9mgnwf4/)

**Ease of Use**  
One of the most entertaining aspects of using this machine is its intuitive one-touch operation. I love when gadgets are simple and functional, and this ice maker hits the mark. Fill the tank, power it on, and select from two size options for your ice cubes‚Äîsmall or large. The LED indicator lights are a nice touch, alerting me when it‚Äôs time to refill water or empty the ice basket. It spares me the guesswork, so I can focus on more important things, like enjoying iced coffee or an overly ambitious DIY cocktail.

**Hygiene and Maintenance**  
The self-cleaning feature is where this ice maker really earns applause. With a press of the CLEAN button, it kicks off a 30-minute sanitization process to eliminate mineral buildup and odors. Since we use hard water, this feature has been a lifesaver and keeps the ice tasting fresh batch after batch.  

**Perks**  
- Compact and portable design, easily fitting on countertops or in RVs.  
- Quick ice production‚Äîready in only six minutes.  
- User-friendly interface with simple controls and alerts.  

**Critiques**  
- Limited storage capacity at 1.3 pounds of ice.  
- Occasional noise during operation, though it‚Äôs not disruptive.  

**Competing Brands**  
This isn‚Äôt the first countertop ice maker I‚Äôve tried. Comparing it to brands like GE Profile or Frigidaire, the Silonn SLIM21B holds up well in terms of compactness and mobility. While the GE Profile boasts more storage and advanced features like Wi-Fi compatibility, it also comes with a steeper price. Frigidaire‚Äôs models are similarly compact but lack the one-touch operation and self-cleaning functionality that I‚Äôve come to love in this device. You‚Äôre essentially trading a few premium features for affordability and ease of use with this model.

**Value Proposition**  
Affordability remains this product‚Äôs main attraction. Its combination of portability, convenience, and decent ice output makes it feel like a smart purchase for those who don‚Äôt need an industrial-grade machine. It slides comfortably into the ""budget-friendly"" category, filling the gap between luxury ice makers and cheaper, unreliable ones.

1k5wukv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k5wukv/explore_if_keurig_kelite_coffee_maker_is_worth/,Explore if Keurig K-Elite Coffee Maker is Worth the Hype in This Review,"The Keurig K-Elite (model K-Elite) has been part of my daily coffee ritual for weeks now, and I must say, it's proven to be a versatile and reliable coffee maker. As someone who thrives on copious amounts of caffeine to fuel both workdays and lazy Saturday mornings, this coffee maker has genuinely elevated the way I craft my morning brew. But like all products, it‚Äôs not without its quirks.

**Design and Build: A Modern Elegance**
Aesthetically, the machine's brushed slate finish paired with a modern design fits beautifully into any kitchen's d√©cor. I‚Äôm not one to obsess over appliances looking like art pieces, but this coffee maker‚Äôs sleek appearance oddly makes me feel more organized. The material feels sturdy, and even after pushing buttons and swapping out the water reservoir multiple times daily, it doesn‚Äôt show any signs of wear or cheap construction. The buttons are responsive, and the layout feels intuitive, though I'd note they might seem overwhelming for someone who's not too tech-savvy. 

**Favorable Attributes**
- Large 75-ounce water reservoir means fewer refills, even when I drink four cups of coffee a day.
- The brushed finish doesn‚Äôt show smudges, which is a minor but lovely design perk for someone messy like me.
- Strong Brew option consistently produces a bold and rich cup of coffee.

[Check Keurig K-Elite price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b078nn17k3/)

**Brew Customization and Performance**
One of this coffee maker's best features is its robust customization settings. The Keurig K-Elite allows me to brew at five different cup sizes, ranging from 4 ounces up to the bustling, stress-busting 12 ounces. The Strong Brew button adds a delightful kick on those particularly rough mornings. I used this button often, usually pairing it with the iced coffee feature during warmer afternoons. Speaking of iced coffee, the machine does a solid job. It‚Äôs not perfect and can't replicate coffee-shop-quality iced coffee, but it holds its ground quite admirably.

Temperature control is another highlight here. Adjusting between 187¬∞F and 192¬∞F might seem like a minor difference to some, but I noticed my darker roasts came alive at the higher end of its temperature range. It also doubles as a hot water dispenser for soups and oatmeal, which is a surprisingly helpful feature I wasn‚Äôt expecting to use as much.

**Strengths**
- Iced coffee feature produces a refreshing, full-flavored drink at the touch of a button.
- Customizable strength and temperature options enhance brewing possibilities.
- Quick brewing capabilities save time when in a rush.

**Convenience and Maintenance**
The removable drip tray and reservoir are lifesavers. I‚Äôve brewed coffee directly into my taller travel mug without a hitch. It's an efficient machine, but maintenance reminders for descaling stand out to me as a particularly considerate addition to the system. This notification prevented me from neglecting the machine and allows for cleaner operations, translating to better-tasting coffee.

That said, it‚Äôs not all rainbows. Removing the water reservoir weekly for cleaning has reinforced its slight bulkiness. With its dimensions of roughly 9.9""D x 13.1""W x 12.7""H, this doesn‚Äôt qualify as compact.

**Areas for Improvement**
- It feels a bit bulky, especially for smaller kitchen counters.
- The machine is fully automatic but without an app or any built-in smart-home compatibility in a world where more devices are leaning that way.
- The drip tray, while removable, requires careful cleaning after accidental spills to avoid any lingering coffee stains.

**Competing Products**
Compared to other models I‚Äôve tried, such as the Nespresso Vertuo and even other Keurig systems, this machine carves its niche. The Vertuo has better crema and arguably a higher-end feel, though it restricts you to its proprietary pods. On the flip side, Keurig offers compatibility with a wide variety of third-party K-Cups. However, versus the older Keurig K-Classic, the K-Elite takes a noticeable leap forward in features like the Strong Brew and iced coffee settings, ensuring you get more value for its (higher) price.

**Value Proposition**
How does this fare regarding value? Considering its capabilities and level of customization, I believe it offers a reasonable balance between performance and cost. Unlike some of the ultra-premium machines that cost several hundred dollars more while offering marginal improvements, I feel the Keurig K-Elite hits the sweet spot for most coffee lovers‚Äô budgets. Plus, its compatibility with reusable filters adds a slight nod to sustainability. With that said, if you're someone who drinks only one or two cups a week, this might be overkill and less cost-effective in the long term.

I‚Äôd wake up, feel that mix of anxiety and mental clutter, and instead of doing something small to start the day, I‚Äôd scroll. Social media, Reddit, random videos. Sometimes for 10 minutes. Sometimes for over an hour.

Then I‚Äôd feel guilty for wasting time. Then overwhelmed because I was behind. Then I‚Äôd avoid what I needed to do even more. That early scroll spiral was like setting the tone for a day of avoidance.

A few days ago I saw a post that said something really simple: go outside and get some sunlight as soon as you wake up. No big routine, no perfect schedule. Just light in your eyes instead of phone in your hand.

So I tried it. I left my phone on the kitchen counter and just stepped outside for a few minutes when I got up. I didn‚Äôt even know what I was doing at first. I just stood there.

Weirdly, it helped. I felt more awake. My thoughts weren‚Äôt as scrambled. And because I wasn‚Äôt already deep in a scroll hole, I actually had a better chance of doing one productive thing to start the day.

It‚Äôs not a cure. I still procrastinate. But it helped interrupt the pattern. And that tiny interruption gave me enough space to choose better, even if it was just making coffee without my phone or writing a to-do list without pressure.

If mornings are where you usually lose the day before it even starts, try changing that first five minutes. It helped me more than I expected.",22,1745407850.0,Procrastinationism,4,0.96,False

When we hit the¬†*Kraken,*¬†the boys formed a ring me and we simply stood as thousands of men and women cheered in the staging centre. There were hollers, cheers, songs erupted spontaneously. Everyone and his dog tried to pat us on the back.¬†

The XO was there to greet us. He was a small man from home. As a fellow Hellicon, he came up to me directly and put his arm around me. He was beaming and laughed, ‚ÄúDrinks on me, boys.‚Äù

I found it hard to stand and was thankful my suit stifled the painful grunt that came out of me.

Sarge managed to push us through the throng of well-wishers. Thousands of crew swarmed us, cheering and singing.¬†

There were calls of ‚ÄúEven if the sky falls on them, the Angels of Terra are always victorious!!‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know for the others but I certainly didn‚Äôt feel victorious. The bugs had pushed us back. We had had to flee from their tunnels.¬†

The XO had his arms around my shoulders. I shrugged him off and said, ‚ÄúWe need to debrief.‚Äù

The XO seemed hurt and a little taken aback so I added, ‚ÄúBut yes, we did reach mission parameters. We will celebrate but after mission debrief.‚Äù

We moved off to our quarters and debrief.¬†

Sarge flashed a message which read, ‚ÄúHow are you doing, Haze?‚Äù

I grunted and replied, ‚ÄúFine, Sarge.‚Äù

Immediately, the message turned to coms and Sarge‚Äôs voice filled my ears, ‚ÄúI have feedback on your bioreads, Haze.‚Äù

Shit. True.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù

Sarge cut me off and said, ‚ÄúReport to med bay. I‚Äôll clear it with the Captain.‚Äù

All I could say was, ‚ÄúYes, Sir.‚Äù

Twenty minutes later, I was standing in med bay with a shocked looking doc staring at me. Sarge was standing beside me. It was just the three of us in the room.

The doc was a small man, black hair, black eyes, from the European block, Italian accent. He was utterly surprised and in awe when he saw the two of us standing in his office. He did try to remain professional but even to our, untrained eye, he failed miserably. He looked at us, barely able to maintain his composure. He mopped the sweat off his brow, spreading a light yellow smear on the sleeve of his white lab coat. He whipped his hands on his coat and, extending his right one, said, ‚ÄúSpecialists. What a surprise! How can we be of service?‚Äù

I immediately stated, ‚ÄúI was exposed to an off-world atmosphere. My suit breached and I had difficulty breathing.‚Äù

The doc nodded and said, ‚ÄúToxin inhalation.‚Äù

As I continued, ‚ÄúI was also hit by plasma fire. The suit took the brunt of it but that‚Äôs how the suit breached.‚Äù

‚ÄúThird-degree burn.‚Äù

I went on, ‚ÄúI had a pain in the chest after that.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlasma burn and toxin inhalation will do that. Anything else?‚Äù

I shrugged and muttered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. Probably.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôll put you through the bioscans and see what‚Äôs the problem. Please wait a minute as I calibrate the machine. It‚Äôs not meant for people of‚Ä¶ well, of your size, Sirs.‚Äù

He fidgeted with a few controls and the scanner swirled and hummed.¬†

He bade me to get undressed and lay naked on the slab and when I did so, the scanner‚Äôs probes started buzzing around me. For a second, I thought the scanners looked like bugs. I felt my hands grip the edge of the slab. The thin metal creaked and groaned under the pressure.

The doc muttered, ‚ÄúRelax. You‚Äôre going to break the table.‚Äù

The scanner flew for a couple of minutes until the lights in the scanner turned blue and a loud beep was heard.¬†

The doc was looking at the screen and started muttering to himself, ‚ÄúIncredible. Unbelievable.‚Äù

Sarge brought him out of his musings and the doctor immediately told me to sit up as he attached some kind of device on my back. A sharp pain hit me but it was nothing compared to what I had just been through planetside. I heard him loud and clear this time, ‚ÄúAstonishing.‚Äù

I could feel the skin on my back slowly knitting together.¬†

‚ÄúThat wound is healing. Visibly healing.‚Äù

‚ÄúDoc? How‚Äôs it looking?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe should be dead. Look. I can fit my entire fist in that hole. But that‚Äôs not the most astonishing. I mean, look!! The hole is closing. Cell division is 3000% faster than a normal human. I mean astonishing doesn‚Äôt cover it. I‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt think this was even possible. Look!‚Äù, he said to no one in particular, ‚ÄúNew flesh is being made. I have never seen anything like this. What are you people?‚Äù

Sarge ignored the question and asked, ‚ÄúIs Specialist Haze going to be okay?‚Äù

The doc was poking me with something, my flesh twitched in pain.¬†

‚ÄúDoc! Focus! Specialist Haze. How‚Äôs he doing??‚Äù

The doc seemed out of it. He ignored Sarge and went on, ‚ÄúI had heard of the augmentation program but I didn‚Äôt think¬†*this*¬†was possible. I mean. You boys are practically indestructible. A wound like this would have torn through a tank. And you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ fine. Why hasn‚Äôt this become standard practice for all those in service?‚Äù

I had an answer to his question but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs what the doc wanted to hear.

Sarge snapped his fingers in the doc‚Äôs face, ‚ÄúHey, Doc. Focus. Haze. Good? Yes? No?‚Äù

The doctor seemed to come back to us and quickly said, ‚ÄúYes, yes, a few days of rest and he will be fine. Maybe less given how quickly he‚Äôs healing.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Will he need any further medical procedures?‚Äù

The doctor still had his eyes on the data collected from the machines. He was totally absorbed by what he was reading and off-handedly muttered, ‚ÄúNo, no.‚Äù Then more to himself, ‚ÄúUnbelievable, the rate of cell division is just‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

I was collecting my clothes and started getting dressed when I heard a sharp snap. I turned on my heels to see the doctor falling to the ground, his neck at an impossible angle. Sarge was standing next to him, looking impassively at the now dead doctor.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Sarge?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt had to be done, Haze. No one can ever know that we can be harmed. We have to be absolute, untouchable, undefeatable. This is what the normies need us to be. This is what Terra needs us to be.‚Äù

I looked down at the dead doctor and wondered, ‚Äò*What else is this war going to take from us?*‚Äô

‚ÄúPurge all records of us being here, Specialist Haze.‚Äù

I snapped to attention and went to work deleting all info on my presence in medbay while Sarge folded the doc‚Äôs body into an impossibly small ball and shoved it down the hazmat shoot to be fed directly into the ship‚Äôs reactor.

He turned to me and asked, ‚ÄúDone?‚Äù

I nodded and the two of us left medbay.¬†

We were making our way to our quarters when two of the crew saw us and dragged us to the rec room. When we got there, there was one hell of a party going on. The rec room is a couple of twenty meters wide and about about hundred meters long but I don‚Äôt know how they did it but the entire crew of the Saratoga and the surviving ground troops managed to squeeze themselves in. We celebrated to the wee hours of the morning. During the party, I saw Sarge and the Captain talking seriously over drinks. I guess he was smoothing over what had happened in medbay. My attention was ripped away from the scene but one very pretty Lieutenant who dragged me to the middle of the room and dance, much to everyone‚Äôs delight.¬†

After that, the evening became a blur of drinks, music and partying. We had managed to defeat the bugs, on their territory no less. We had proved that ground deployment was a viable option. We had proved that SkyFall was technically and logistically possible. This was mission success.¬†

When I woke up the following day, I had one hell of a headache and was thankful we didn‚Äôt have another deployment in sight. I guess the brass needed time to see how the situation had changed now that we had struck the Bugs a major blow. The six of us were sitting at a table in the mess hall, nursing what the cook had promised us was coffee.

I heard Kitten ask one of the crew, ‚ÄúAny news on the¬†*Saratoga?‚Äù*

The woman he had asked simply stated, \*‚Äú\*The¬†*Saratoga*¬†had been lost.‚Äù

Kitten looked crestfallen but the woman went on, ‚ÄúShe isn‚Äôt the only ship we lost. The¬†*Agammenon*¬†was slagged. The¬†*Morrigan*¬†survived, just. She‚Äôs still venting atmo from what I heard. Most of the corvettes survived because they were nimble enough to avoid the plasma bolts from Bug ships. Out the hundred plus ships sent out to pick up the troops of Operation Skyfall only 36 survived.‚Äù

I quickly did the maths, every ship could hold about 40 to 50 troopers. If we had been on board, call it 30. Out of the 15,000 troops that went down into those tunnels, between 1,440 and 1,800 survived. 10%. Not good but better than the millions who fell when we weren‚Äôt sent.

I asked, ‚ÄúAny of the crew manage to get to the lifeboats?‚Äù

The woman shook her head and simply stated, ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

There wasn‚Äôt much left to be said after that. Kitten put his arm around the woman and hugged her. She seemed tense but, after a few seconds, she started sobbing.¬†

I looked at her and didn‚Äôt know what to do. Kitten looked as lost as I felt.¬†

The three of us sat at the table in silence for five minutes as the woman cried herself out.¬†

After five minutes, there was a call, ‚ÄúAll Specialists, assemble in the briefing room. Repeat. All Specialists are to assemble in the briefing room.‚Äù

I started to move and heard Kitten say, ‚ÄúI need to go.‚Äù

As I briskly walked down the corridor to the briefing room, I heard Kitten‚Äôs footsteps right behind me. I looked back at him and chided, ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre popular.‚Äù

Kitten smiled and shrugged, ‚ÄúWhat can I say?‚Äù

As we made our way to the briefing room, Hasan joined us.

Kitten decided he was going to start an argument for being wrenched from his girl. I‚Äôm guessing that‚Äôs why he decided to pick a fight with Hasan.¬†

He simply said, ‚ÄúI wonder if we‚Äôre going to be sent to another world being bombarded by the Fleet.‚Äù

Hasan immediately responded, ‚ÄúWe managed to achieve mission objectives.‚Äù

Kitten shrugged and said, ‚ÄúIt still sucked that we had to deploy during a meteor strike. I mean, what was the tactical advantage?‚Äù

Hasan hesitated for a second which was unusual in itself. He took the time it took to turn the corner to the walkway to the briefing room to think, ‚ÄúWell, it also was a fact finding mission. Skyfall was some sort of proving ground. We had to prove Skyfall was actually feasible. Check. Was it possible for the Fleet to manage the resources to sustain orbital bombardment? Check. Was troop deployment possible during bombardment? Check. There are still questions that need answering though.‚Äù

Kitten listened stoically and again shrugged, ‚ÄúWell, still sucks being dropped during a meteor strike.‚Äù

Hasan shrugged back and replied, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs part of the job, Kitten.‚Äù

By the time we had got to briefing, Kitten and the Assassin were chatting about something else. Apparently, Hasan had found info about civi societies. He was reading some data slate about the state of civilian worlds.

‚ÄúThe loss of Terra was a blessing in a way.‚Äù

I looked at Hasan as if he had grown another head. This was so close to treason. I stopped in my tracks and bluntly said, ‚ÄúExplain.‚Äù

My hand had balled into a fist and I realised I was getting ready to strike him.¬†

He kept on walking, apparently ignorant of the effect he was having on me, ‚ÄúWe have now a form of unity that has never been seen before. All talks of dissension has stopped, the trading wars between our worlds have disappeared. We are now one people, one mind, one goal.‚Äù

As I listened to him, I realised he was right. We had never been this united. There were stories in the news everyday of civi ships bringing aid to Holy Terra. Thousands of fleets from every world we had colonised were coming home, even pirate fleets. It really was as if all of Terra‚Äôs children had come home to be by her side. The cordon of life that had evacuated the people off of Holy Terra had now been replaced by these ships. They brought everything, anything that Holy Terra would need to bring her back to her former glory.¬†

I remember hearing of the first time the Golden Fleet had entered Terra‚Äôs system. They were infamous. Pirates. They gave no quarter, took no prisoners. They raided small outposts and colonies in impunity. They didn‚Äôt care if you were human or Xeno, as long as you had something they wanted, they would take it. They were an old group. Hell, my father had fought against them when he was a pilot. The Fleet had never managed to get their hands on them however. They usually jumped into system, raced through orbital defences, raided and then jumped out before anyone could react. In open space, they raided individual ships, boarding them and stripping them of anything useful. In occupied systems, they attacked in waves before retreating and coming back. Over and over and over until they had crippled those they were raiding. They were feared and hated.¬†

It had been a couple months ago, a day or two after Holy Terra had been struck. It would have made headline news but with the on-going war and the Fall of Terra, it went mostly unnoticed. That is until about fifty ships from breachers to destroyers and even a light cruiser showed up on the fringes of the systems. It had set off all alarms and the Fleet had been mustered.¬†

I was surprised that they hadn‚Äôt been shot out of the sky but, from what I read afterwards, the pirates had sent an envoy. Fednets had reported the entire exchange. Apparently, it went down something like this.

\-Whoever you are. This is Holy Space. Fuck off.

\-This is Admiral Nagata of the Golden Fleet. I am in the skiff approaching on vector 777.¬†

There was a pause.¬†

\-What do you want?¬†

\-We have heard Popess Chrystal XI‚Äôs summons and have to come to pledge ourselves to the defence of Holy Terra.¬†

\-What?!

\-We spend a lot of time in Xeno territory to avoid Federal patrols. We have detailed info on patrols, their routes, their numbers. I am here to offer that knowledge as well as the support of the Golden Fleet in the defence of Holy Terra¬†

\-‚Ä¶ One moment.

‚Ä¶

\-Understand that if you twitch the wrong way, we will blow you out of the sky.¬†

\-Yes, Ma‚Äôam.¬†

\-Form up on Fleet Cerberus around Ganymede.¬†

I guess teaming up with pirates was ok then.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The cup holders for motorbikes offer several noteworthy features that contribute to their overall usability and rider satisfaction.

**Adjustable Clamp Diameter:**

The majority of motorbike cup holders come with an adjustable clamp diameter, allowing them to securely attach to various parts of the bike, such as the handlebars, frame, or engine guard.

The clamp diameter typically ranges from 0.5 inches to 1.5 inches, accommodating most standard motorbike bar sizes.

**360-Degree Rotation:**

Many models feature a 360-degree rotation capability, enabling riders to position the cup holder at the most convenient and accessible angle.

Common materials include high-strength ABS plastic, aluminum alloy, and stainless steel.

**Secure Cup Retention System:**

A secure cup retention system is crucial for preventing spills and keeping beverages in place while riding. Cup holders often incorporate features such as adjustable arms, rubber grips, or a deep cup well to accommodate different cup sizes and shapes.

**Housing Complaint - Non Emergency**
Neighbors at 1457 and 1458 park all in the road in front of their houses which makes exiting Stephen foster difficult. At 1458 they get mad if you go slowly around them and threaten to assault you. Tickets have been put on their cars for them to move them, for months now but nothing has actually been done. It‚Äôs like this on both ends with people parking on the street/in the way of incoming/outgoing traffic, that end of the road is smaller though so again, very hard to come in and out of.

The quest for independence and mobility often relies on assistive devices like walkers. However, carrying essentials like a cup of coffee or water can be challenging. That's where a reliable cup holder for a walker comes in handy.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The ideal cup holder for a walker should possess several key features to ensure functionality and user satisfaction.

**Universal Compatibility:** A crucial aspect is the cup holder's ability to attach securely to various walker models.

The design should incorporate an adjustable clamping mechanism that can accommodate different frame diameters and shapes. Look for features like rubber padding or textured grips to ensure a snug and non-slip fit, regardless of the walker's design. Universal compatibility avoids the frustration of purchasing a cup holder that doesn't fit the intended walker.

**Secure Cup Retention:** The primary function of a cup holder is to keep beverages secure and prevent spills, especially when navigating uneven surfaces.

The cup holder should feature a deep enough well to securely hold standard-sized cups, bottles, and travel mugs. Features like internal grips, adjustable arms, or flexible membranes that conform to different container shapes can further enhance retention. Testimonials highlighting the cup holder's ability to withstand bumps and vibrations without spilling are valuable indicators of its effectiveness.

**Durable Construction:** Walkers are often used outdoors and subjected to varying weather conditions, so the cup holder's construction materials are crucial for longevity.

Look for cup holders made from durable, weather-resistant materials like high-impact plastic, stainless steel, or powder-coated aluminum. These materials can withstand exposure to rain, sunlight, and everyday wear and tear without corroding or becoming brittle. Check for reinforced stress points and sturdy mounting hardware to ensure the cup holder remains securely attached to the walker over time.

**Easy Installation and Removal:** A user-friendly design should allow for quick and easy attachment and detachment without requiring tools or specialized skills.

The cup holder should feature a simple clamping mechanism or quick-release lever that allows for tool-free installation and removal. The design should also allow the cup holder to be easily repositioned or transferred to another walker if needed. Clear and concise installation instructions are essential for ensuring a hassle-free experience.

**Adjustability and Positioning:** The ability to adjust the cup holder's angle or position can enhance user comfort and accessibility.

Some cup holders feature a swivel mechanism or adjustable arm that allows users to customize the angle and position of the cup holder to suit their preferences. This adjustability can be particularly beneficial for users with limited mobility or those who prefer to position the cup holder within easy reach. The ability to adjust the cup holder can also prevent interference with the walker's folding mechanism.

Key features of the best cup holder for walkers include:
  * Universal compatibility with different walker models
  * Secure cup retention to prevent spills
  * Durable construction for long-lasting performance
  * Easy installation and removal for user convenience
  * Adjustability and positioning for enhanced comfort

 ## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality cup holder for a walker provides numerous practical benefits that can significantly improve the user's daily life.

**Enhanced Hydration and Convenience:** The most obvious benefit is the ability to easily carry and access beverages while using a walker. This promotes better hydration and reduces the need to rely on others for assistance. For example, a user can keep a water bottle within easy reach during a walk in the park, promoting regular hydration and preventing dehydration-related fatigue.

**Increased Independence and Mobility:** By allowing users to carry beverages and other small items, a cup holder can enhance their independence and mobility. Users can perform tasks like running errands or visiting friends without needing assistance carrying their belongings. This increased independence can boost their confidence and improve their overall quality of life.

**Improved Safety and Stability:** Carrying a beverage in one hand while using a walker can compromise stability and increase the risk of falls. A cup holder eliminates this risk by providing a secure place to store drinks, allowing users to maintain a firm grip on the walker at all times. This enhanced stability can be particularly beneficial for users with balance issues or limited strength.

**Reduced Spills and Messes:** A well-designed cup holder can significantly reduce the likelihood of spills and messes, especially when navigating uneven surfaces or crowded areas. Features like secure cup retention and spill-resistant designs can prevent accidents and keep the user and their surroundings clean. This is especially important for users who are prone to tremors or have difficulty holding objects steady.

**Greater Versatility and Functionality:** Some cup holders are designed to accommodate not only beverages but also other small items like keys, phones, or medications. This versatility can further enhance the user's convenience and independence by providing a convenient place to store essential items while using their walker. The added functionality can be especially useful for users who have limited storage options on their walker or prefer to keep their belongings within easy reach.

 ## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions is essential for providing informed purchasing decisions.

**Will this cup holder fit my specific walker model?**
  Most reputable cup holders are designed with universal compatibility in mind. Look for models with adjustable clamps and attachments that can accommodate various walker frame sizes and shapes. Check the product specifications and customer reviews for feedback on compatibility with specific walker models. It's also helpful to measure the diameter of your walker's frame to ensure a proper fit.

**Is the cup holder easy to install and remove without tools?**
  The best cup holders feature tool-free installation and removal. They typically use a clamping mechanism or quick-release lever that allows you to easily attach and detach the cup holder without needing any special tools. Look for models with clear and concise installation instructions. If you have limited dexterity or strength, prioritize cup holders with simple and intuitive installation processes.

**How durable is the cup holder, and will it withstand outdoor use?**
  Durability is an important consideration, especially if you plan to use your walker outdoors. Look for cup holders made from weather-resistant materials like high-impact plastic, stainless steel, or powder-coated aluminum. These materials can withstand exposure to rain, sunlight, and everyday wear and tear without corroding or becoming brittle. Check customer reviews for feedback on the cup holder's durability and its ability to withstand outdoor conditions.

**Can the cup holder accommodate different sizes of cups and bottles?**
  A versatile cup holder should be able to accommodate a variety of cup and bottle sizes. Look for models with adjustable arms, flexible membranes, or deep wells that can securely hold different container shapes and sizes. Consider the types of beverages you typically carry and choose a cup holder that is compatible with your preferred containers. Some cup holders also have additional compartments or slots for holding smaller items like keys or phones.

1k5wggg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1k5wggg/part_2_im_a_custodian_at_denver_international/,"[Part 2] I'm a custodian at Denver International Airport. The urban legends about the airport are lies, the truth is so much worse","[Part 1 ](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/128vms0/im_a_custodian_at_denver_international_airport/)

I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs taken me so long to update, but I‚Äôm here now, and ready to tell you everything. To answer the obvious question, I‚Äôm still alive. As to why I didn‚Äôt update in so long, well, you‚Äôll see when you read. A lot has happened, it may take me a few posts to catch you all up, but I‚Äôll do my best. I‚Äôm on the move a lot - I‚Äôm writing this from a coffee shop - so I may post a bit irregularly, but I want to get this out to all of you, you all deserve to know.

After just barely escaping whoever was after me at the Denver airport, I went to a cockroach infested motel in Commerce City. The bed had so many stains I didn‚Äôt know what color it even was originally, but I felt relieved to be somewhere safe. I paid in cash and had trashed my cellphone before I got here, so despite the dinginess of the place, it felt like paradise.

I had only been in the motel for a few days, surviving off takeout and still trying to figure out what to do next when I was roused by a phone call on the motel phone. I was startled, but answered assuming it was the property manager or something else. Instead, I nearly had a heart attack when I heard my boss on the other end.

‚ÄúHey - I heard you had moved, and you didn‚Äôt come into work today, so I¬†just wanted to call to make sure you were okay and were going to come in tomorrow - I‚Äôd hate to have to fire you. One of the maintenance guys told me you got into an area where they handle noxious chemicals, and seemed to have a freakout.‚Äù

I gulped hard, and tried to sound calm when I spoke back to him. ‚ÄúOf course, just a little under the weather today after, uh, having some hallucinations I guess yesterday.‚Äù

My boss replied very calmly, like he had heard all this before ‚ÄúOf course - you‚Äôre not the first one to have this happen - to be honest it‚Äôs really an OSHA violation probably, but what are you going to do, call the cops, what good would that do - for any of us?‚Äù With that he let out the most threatening belly laugh I‚Äôve heard in my life.

‚ÄúOf course not - I just want to get back to work.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we are all on the same page - tell you what, how about you take one more day to recover -it‚Äôs on us, after all, it sounds like your *hallucination* scared you half to death. I‚Äôll see you day after tomorrow.‚Äù

He hung up before I could answer, less asking a question than making a statement. While the person I spoke to was definitely my boss, somehow the kind and jovial man who had hired me and seemed like everyone at work‚Äôs dad now had a hostile and threatening edge to everything he said. Did he really imply going to the police wouldn‚Äôt help, and that I‚Äôd be okay if I just returned and kept my mouth shut? I really wasn‚Äôt sure what to do, but the fact that my work knew where I was meant that the people who had tried to get me knew where I was too, so perhaps going to work again was the least dangerous thing all things considered. I waffled back and forth over the next day. Finally I decided: the least risky thing was to go in.

The morning I went back I boarded the same bus I had fled in a few days before. Going back to the airport felt surreal - everything that had been normal and comforting now felt threatening and strange. Walking into our staff room to get ready for the day my co-workers were socializing and joking around as normal. I caught a view of myself in the mirror, I looked pale and gaunt. I was startled out of my haze by my boss slapping me hard on the back ‚ÄúHey! So glad you‚Äôre back and healthy! Why don‚Äôt we have a quick talk before you start work. Let's go to my office, okay?‚Äù

In my boss‚Äô office there was another man - the man I had seen in a suit before in the weird room that lowered people into the floor. It took a lot of effort not to run right out of the room, but I sat down.

My boss sat at his desk and spoke first, ‚ÄúLet me introduce you to our colleague in maintenance - Chuck.‚Äù

Chuck nodded at me, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry if we startled you last week - we were just so worried after you were exposed to that gas you might be hallucinating - we wanted to get you medical care. Are you feeling better now?‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm doing fine, I just - I want to make sure this won‚Äôt impact my um - ‚Äú

‚ÄúYou getting to keep *doing* your job?‚Äù my boss helped me finish.

‚ÄúUh, yeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe know you posted about what you think you saw to reddit, but we want to make sure you know that was just a hallucination - not reality. As long as you can tell that difference, and avoid any further disparagement of the airport, I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll have any problems, and we can all go back to work as normal - and I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll have any problems continuing to do your job.‚Äù Chuck said calmly.

I nodded slowly, understanding what was both said and unsaid. ‚ÄúSure. I hallucinated. No problem, I‚Äôll just uh, try to avoid being in maintenance sections of the airport to avoid further‚Ä¶hallucinations.‚Äù

Chuck smiled broadly. ‚ÄúGreat. I think we‚Äôre done here then.‚Äù

With that, we all shook hands, and I returned uneasily to my duties. I was terrified that they were just putting me into a false sense of security - and I was ill at ease for quite some time. After a few weeks though I began to believe that if I just kept my mouth shut and did my job, they'd leave me alone, and that seemed like a fair deal to me.

But now that I knew what was happening, I kept seeing more things. Every once in a while on the airport train, I‚Äôd see a train veer off in an odd direction, going to the maintenance platform I had gone to. Every once in a while, someone would ask me if I had seen someone that they had lost in the airport and I‚Äôd lie and say I had no idea where they went, and rationalize that maybe they were just lost not *lost*. I told myself even if it was horrible, it wasn‚Äôt my concern, I just had to stay alive. After a while, I just made my peace with it, saying it was rare and who really knew what was happening or why - it became like anything else you get exposed to day in and day out.

Everything changed a few weeks ago. My sister was flying in, and I‚Äôll admit, I felt a bit of worry that somehow she would end up on the wrong airport train like I had. With this in mind, I had my dad drive the two of us to the airport to pick her up early, and I managed to use my staff credentials to get airside so I could meet her at the gate.

With each person coming off the plane, I kept telling myself she was coming, I just had to be patient. Finally I saw the flight attendants coming off the plane and my heart fell into my stomach, terrified that my refusal to talk about this had finally led to my punishment. I began pacing unsure of what to do now, only to see her come out of the gate joking around with the last flight attendant off the plane a few seconds later, apparently having made a new friend. I ran to her and hugged her, and we headed back to the terminal.

We got back to the terminal, and went out to the parking garage, only to realize that our father who had been waiting in the car was nowhere to be found. After asking around for a half hour, we found out he had gone into the terminal building to use the restroom, and then disappeared.

I sat quietly in the terminal, entirely shutdown, while the police, my mom, and my sister all tried to figure out where my dad was, while I knew all too well. I imagined him being lowered into that hole in the ground, screaming as he went down. Finally, the man my boss had called Chuck came out, and said they thought they may have found my dad wandering in a back corridor, and they‚Äôd bring him right up. My sister and mom were relieved that he was back, while I was just terrified at *what* would come back.

When the person who looked like my dad came out of one of the no entry doorways into the terminal, my sister and mother embraced him. I stared at him quietly as they hugged, and he shot me a confused glance of sadness that was only momentarily replaced with a malicious smile and a quick wink.

I¬¥m in a creative job. I work behind a pc (ios), 2 monitors and a nice audio set the whole day. I have an office space with no one around. But my mind likes to wander and I cannot be creative the whole day without interruptions. - meaning, if I don¬¥t allow myself to put up some music or talk I feel like it ¬¥s a boring day. 
Lately I feel I¬¥m distracted a lot. I swith playlists a lot or look for a great new album, run YT videos with talks in the background - and browse those, check my mails, do all sort of small (less 5 min) tasks in between, calls, make coffee. I even do the admin stuff for some reason before doing the real tasks at hand. 

I¬¥m playing with the idea of turning off wifi and the 2nd monitor for fixed times a day.

1k5wfe6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1k5wfe6/it_started_small/,It Started Small,"It started last Thursday.
Nothing big. The hallway light was off when he got up to use the bathroom. He was almost certain he‚Äôd left it on. But maybe not. Maybe he‚Äôd just thought about it and never actually flipped the switch. It was late. He was tired.

The next morning, he found the coffee canister in the fridge. He never put it there. Still, people make little mistakes all the time. He laughed at himself, shook his head, and moved on.

Then the garage door was open. Wide open. He hadn‚Äôt even gone outside the day before. He stood at the doorway for a while, trying to remember locking it, trying to picture himself turning the key. He couldn‚Äôt. But memory gets fuzzy. That‚Äôs normal. That‚Äôs what he told himself.

Soon, it was something new every day. A drawer left open. A shirt in the laundry he didn‚Äôt remember wearing. Water running in the bathroom when he hadn‚Äôt been in there. He started checking the locks before bed. He started writing little notes to himself.

One evening, he walked into the kitchen and found a man standing by the sink.

‚ÄúWho are you?‚Äù he asked.

The man turned around, calm. ‚ÄúI live here.‚Äù

Panic crawled up his spine.

‚ÄúNo, you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

The man just walked past him, didn‚Äôt even look twice.

He didn‚Äôt sleep much after that.

The next morning, all the picture frames were different. Not just rearranged, the actual photos. New people. Strangers. A child he didn‚Äôt recognize smiling at a woman he‚Äôd never met. He stared at it for a long time, waiting for the memory to come.

It didn‚Äôt.

Then came the morning when he woke up and the entire house felt wrong. The air smelled off. The floors seemed too cold. The hallway was longer than it should‚Äôve been. The sofa wasn‚Äôt where it was supposed to be. He opened cabinets and didn‚Äôt recognize the dishes. The silverware was too heavy.

He sat down in the middle of the living room and stared at the walls like they might move if he watched long enough.

A knock at the door broke the silence.

A woman stepped in, clipboard in hand, gentle voice.

‚ÄúHi. I‚Äôm with home care. Your daughter called. You‚Äôve been confused lately.‚Äù

He looked at her.

She spoke slowly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve been showing signs of dementia. But it‚Äôs okay. We‚Äôre here to help.‚Äù

He turned back to the living room.

He didn‚Äôt know this place. He didn‚Äôt know the couch. Or the photos. Or the air. It wasn‚Äôt his.

But everyone else was so sure it was.

And that was the worst part.

I'm a 19-year-old student from Lithuania, and I'm looking for female friends from Europe or even Lithuania who would like to chat and maybe even become good friends.

I'm really into art! Whenever I have free time, I love drawing and painting. I enjoy visiting art galleries, going to the theater, and watching movies. I once volunteered at a theater, which made me fall in love with acting and performance arts. Besides that, I love watching all kinds of movies and series, especially about history, politics, and nature but I also enjoy something fun and lighthearted. Right now, I‚Äôm really into the series Cunk on Earth.

I love reading books, from classics to psychology. My favorite literature is Lithuanian, and my favorite book is T≈´la.

Music is also a big part of my life. I listen to all kinds of genres, from classical and jazz to electronic music. Some of my favorite artists are Aphex Twin, The Smiths, Kamani≈≥ ≈†ilelis, Alina Orlova, The Be Good Tanyas, and many more.

I‚Äôm always curious and love learning new things, so I enjoy reading about history, philosophy, and psychology.

I also love going on walks, whether it's strolling through the old town, walking in parks, or by the river. In summer, I enjoy cycling, wandering through fields and meadows, swimming in lakes, and watching the sunrise and sunset.

Oh, and I‚Äôm a huge coffee fan, it‚Äôs basically my hobby!

1k5w78z,https://www.reddit.com/r/breastfeedingsupport/comments/1k5w78z/five_weeks_pp_and_not_enough_milk/,Five weeks pp and not enough milk,"So our first daughter was born five weeks ago via unplanned c-section due to cardiac issues on her and my side during labor. Now we are both fine and healthy and very happy!

If it wasn't for the breastfeeding issues.
I love breastfeeding her but wounded, bleeding Nipples and a very low milk supply make it a very hard experience for us.
Since the beginning I latch her every second she starts showing signs of appetite. Back in the hospital (day two or three) she became severely dehydrated so we har to start supplementing with formula. So we breastfed with a supplemental nursing system until my nipples started to bleed and fester. We still kept going using nipple shields most of the time and try latching her without when the pain was bearable.
By the time we came home our midwife and lactation consultant advised to supplement using the bottle.
So since then we have been breastfeeding whenever needed (got rid of the shields since three weeks) and supplement whenever she was still hungry using the bottle.
What we do to try and enhance the milk supply:
- While my husband feeds her the bottle I go pump to at least stimulate (medela symphony).
- I have been drinking the WELEDA organic nursing tea (about one liter a day) since birth.
- I started fenugreek seed capsules three times a day like about two weeks back.
- everyday I start at least one powerpumping session additional to the regular nursing/pumping sessions (20/10/15/10/10).
- I stay hydrated (about 2 liters of water, one liter of tea, one cup of coffee a day).
- I have three meals a day (at least one warm meal).
- I mostly carry her around and we spend time bonding every day.
- for the sore nipples I use my milk, silver nipple covers, multi mam compresses, lansinoh lanolin and a lot of fresh air
- we have a lot of help of friends and family if needed, they bring over cooked meals, groceries and help taking care of the household- so there shouldn't be too much stress.
- we wake her up every night for several feeds/pumps and diaper changes (every 2 - 3 hours)
- we go for walks everyday
- I avoid peppermint, parsley, sage etc.


Yet I still dont manage to meet her needs. We still have to supplement about + 300ml of formula a day and it's not getting better.

She is a totally chill baby, sleeping a lot, eating a lot, growing a lot. Totally fine and healthy - no tongue tie or other issues as far as I know of possible issues. She is latching perfectly, the sore nipples appear when the boob is ""empty"" and she tries and fights over more milk before I manage to get a bottle fixed. But it's really bearable by now.
She clearly prefers the boob over the bottle and drinks very well if possible.

Does anyone have any ideas what I can do to be able to fully breastfeed her?

Thank you so much for advice.

Hey there‚Äîthanks for stopping by. Let‚Äôs keep this real, relaxed, and maybe even a little exciting.

I‚Äôm 34, tall, easygoing, and based in the beautiful countryside of Kent. You‚Äôll usually find me outside‚Äîwhether I‚Äôm hiking through woodlands, camping under the stars, or chasing golden hour light with my camera in hand. Nature‚Äôs my happy place, and I‚Äôd love to share it with someone who appreciates quiet beauty, deep connection, and a bit of adventure.

I work with young people, which keeps me grounded, passionate, and intentional about the way I live. I‚Äôm emotionally mature, calm, loyal, and genuinely looking to build something meaningful‚Äîwhether that starts with friendship, sparks into more, or lands somewhere between.

I‚Äôm not into games, ghosting, or shallow convos. I am into thoughtful chats, spontaneous weekends away, and those cozy nights where it feels like time just pauses.

I‚Äôm looking to connect with a younger woman (18+) who‚Äôs curious, open-minded, and emotionally present‚Äîsomeone who knows what she wants (or is figuring it out) and craves a connection that‚Äôs both fun and fulfilling. If you‚Äôre the kind of girl who loves the outdoors, enjoys getting a little muddy on a trail, or secretly dreams of slow mornings in a tent with coffee and kisses‚Äîyou‚Äôre already speaking my language.

I‚Äôm interested in something more than just surface-level. Ideally, you‚Äôre someone who‚Äôs playful but honest, flirty but real, and ready to explore where a genuine spark could go‚Äîphysically, emotionally, maybe even long-term. I value communication, mutual respect, and loyalty. And if there‚Äôs chemistry? I won‚Äôt be shy about showing you just how much I appreciate you.

So, if you‚Äôre looking for a man who‚Äôs down-to-earth, adventurous, emotionally grounded, and ready to give you his full attention‚Äîdrop me a message. Tell me a bit about you‚Äîyour age, where you‚Äôre from, and what you‚Äôre hoping to find.

Let‚Äôs create something worth remembering.

Ang hirap na makahanap ng girl friends with the same wavelength as yours 'no?

Growing up, I had very strict parents. Like super!
Bahay-eskwela lang. Ultimo extracurricular activities bawal.
Hanggang college yan. Naumay ako, nagwork na lang ako. Ganun pa din.

I missed out on experiencing gala, tambay with friends, going out just because, roadtrips, lahat.
Lagi nila katwiran, kasi wala din daw extra money para sa mga ganung bagay. (Pangalawa na lang sa talagang reason nila na BAWAL)

Etong nagka-asawa naman na ako, with adult money, ngayon na ko hirap makahanap ng friends. Sobrang luwag and supportive ng asawa ko sakin sa mga gusto ko. Pag may lakad ako before, yung tatay ko tinatanong pa, ""Oh, alam ba ng asawa mo yan?"", ""Oh, okay lang ba sa asawa mo yan?"" My goodness, asawa ko na nga nagtutulak din sakin lumabas labas at gumala.

Yung mga kaibigan ko noon,, sila naman na ang walang pera, walang extra, ayaw ng asawa, bantay ng bata.
Madalas nililibre na namin sila ng husband ko, makalabas lang talaga kami. 
May kids din ako, 2, pero malalaki na. Pwede na maiwan.

Yung mga friends ko pa, ako lagi naghahabol, naghahanap. Ako lagi nangangamusta at nauuna mag reach out. Until napansin ng asawa ko ang ending, nalulungkot lang din ako, sabi nya andyan naman sya, hayaan ko na lang daw kung ayaw. 

Totoo naman, masaya naman sya kasama. Game naman sya sa mga lakad ko.

Kaya lang there are things na syempre minsan masarap kasama ang friends gawin. I like doing my nails, I do adult coloring, I like reading, I work at night, minsan, masarap may kasama lang sa videocall. 

Naiisip ko lang minsan masarap din may kasamang babae magpa-spa, magpa-wax, mag-coffee, magroadtrip, magshopping, or just mamasyal lang. Masarap magkaron ng friends sana na kapareho mo ng gusto.

Pero at this age, mahirap na pala talaga. Takot na din ako mag build ng friendship with other people siguro. Kasi minsan masakit pa sa heartbreak ang friendship over kesa relationship over.

I've been working tirelessly on a project since February and I'm closing this Friday leaving me free for like the next month. 

In my free time, I'm looking to build at least 5 (single page or 3 pages max) websites for businesses. Could be consultancy, laundry, photography, personal, events or whatever you need.

If you've been wanting a website and holding it off coz you're not yet sure about it or pricing or whatever reason you have, let me know in the comments.

I'm building it all for free. Just a way to give back for the blessing I have in my life at the moment. No strings attached.

You'd only need to cover:
- Domain name: about ugx 35000 per year
- Hosting: about ugx 50000 per year

That's just around ugx 7000 per month total - probably less than your daily coffee!

What you'll get:
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Contact forms
- Image galleries
- Basic SEO setup

First come, first served! In the comments mention your business type and the problem you hope the website will help solve.

1k5vwjj,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovementday/comments/1k5vwjj/i_replaced_morning_scrolling_with_sunlight_and_my/,I replaced morning scrolling with sunlight and my brain feels like it‚Äôs working again,"A couple months ago, I realised my mornings were ruining the rest of my day. I‚Äôd wake up and immediately grab my phone. Before I even got out of bed, I had already scrolled through TikTok, Reddit, the news, and checked my email. I wasn‚Äôt even awake yet and somehow already overstimulated and anxious.

I kept telling myself it was normal. Everyone does it. But I didn‚Äôt feel normal. I felt foggy. I was getting headaches. I couldn‚Äôt focus. My mood felt flat by noon and I‚Äôd crash by 3pm almost every day.

I wanted to feel better but I didn‚Äôt have the energy to overhaul my entire life. So I started small. I picked a few simple habits and committed to testing them for 30 days.

* A ten-minute walk outside after dinner, just to move and clear my head
* A glass of water first thing in the morning before coffee
* Two 15-minute strength or HIIT workouts per week
* And one key change: no phone in the morning until I got real sunlight in my eyes

That last one was the game-changer. At first it felt silly just standing outside staring at the sky, but within a week my mornings felt completely different. I was more alert, less anxious, and way more clear-headed. I started falling asleep faster at night too, which I didn‚Äôt expect. So crazy honeslty.

I didn‚Äôt follow a perfect routine. I missed days. Some mornings it was cloudy or rainy. But overall, this one shift gave me a sense of control over my mornings that I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

Here are a few things that helped me stick with it:

* Move your phone away from your bed. If you have to get up to reach it, you‚Äôre less likely to scroll by default
* Drink water before caffeine. It wakes up your brain better than you think
* Go outside first thing, even if it‚Äôs just for five minutes. Light before screen makes a huge difference
* Pair habits together. I now associate sunlight with music or stretching and it makes it something I look forward to

**Some resources that helped a lot:**

* **Atomic Habits**¬†([https://www.amazon.com.au/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834](https://www.amazon.com.au/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/1847941834)) by James Clear ‚Äì Made me realise I didn‚Äôt need to change everything. Just start with one tiny habit and stack from there.
* **The Huberman Lab Podcast**¬†([https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast](https://www.hubermanlab.com/podcast)) ‚Äì Especially his episodes about light and dopamine. It made the science behind all this click for me.
* **Bright Start**¬†([https://www.brightstart.app](https://www.brightstart.app/)) ‚Äì I found this through a post on this subreddit recently, I got on the waitlist and got access to a demo, it keeps your phone apps locked in the morning until you scan real sunlight. super simple, but really effective.

If you‚Äôre stuck in a cycle of burnout and brain fog, this is your sign. You‚Äôre not lazy or broken. Your habits just need a little sunlight. Start small. Give yourself some space to reset. It really adds up.

1k5vvs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1k5vvs6/how_functional_am_i_should_i_seek_professional/,How functional am I? Should I seek professional advice / medication?,"Hello all!

I'm 29f, I suspect I have ADHD but I haven't sought a professional diagnosis because I always thought it was too mild to be medicated and it was manageable. But I'm increasingly frustrated, it is getting worse, I feel like I need validation, and tools to function better.

I wanted to explain a little bit the things that make me think I have ADHD to get your impressions. (I know this is not professional advice.)

\- I am quite forgetful. It can be forgetting what I wanted to do right after entering a room, it can be forgetting I have rice boiling in the kitchen, or that I have to use a discount code before buying something. It's not too bad - I usually remember just in time (I have an internal clock or something that gives me a mini heart attack every time I remember I have something in the kitchen), but it can also get bad. I had some days in which I burn stuff, forget food in the counter and have to throw it, forget important appointments... I used to tutor and the amount of classes I canceled or moved because I forgot about them is so embarrassing.

\- I can't concentrate when something is boring. Like literally can't. I zone out a lot while talking to people and I have to make a conscious effort to be present.

\- My family always called me lazy. They never saw my struggle to get things done.

\- I need A LOT of buffer time. Preferably alone (I hate it when I'm inside of my brain and someone interrupts, I get intensely and irrationally angry). In the mornings I need around 2-3h before going out, and I can keep up with an intense schedule only for a week (after which I need a week of bedrotting to recover).

\- I always had a hard time with chores. I notice dirt and makes me very uncomfortable but it's hard to me to stick to a cleaning routine. Personal hygiene used to be difficult to maintain some years ago (but I attributed it to depression/anxiety), and eating habits were a mess. I'd forget about eating times and eat at random hours, not knowing what to make and delaying the decision. These days I try to come up with a list of dishes I want to make and make it a rule that I eat at particular hours.

\- I get paralyzed when there are important dates (anniversaries, birthdays) coming up, because I want to do something special for them, and I end up not doing anything at all (on the day) and feeling ashamed. ""Something special"" means a drawing, handcrafts (pottery, knitwear, crochet). I once went overboard and created a role-playing mystery Cluedo with a bunch of plots, subplots and characters. Oh and I also created board games. But every time, if I go through with the idea, I end up gifting it with several months delay. I once celebrated my ex's birthday 4 months late... I keep telling myself I could keep things simple and just buy a present but instead of doing that I just let the date pass.

\- Someone told me this is a thing that happens a lot to ADHD people: coffee doesn't affect me in the way it affects other people. When I started drinking coffee it used to make me really sleepy. It still happens sometimes. It never gives me an energy boost, more like the opposite. If I drink too much my heart starts racing and I don't feel well, but it's not energising.

\- Even though I'm so messy at following schedules and routines, I love creating them and organising stuff. I spend hours and hours creating perfect schedules (I LOVE bullet journaling). It's hard for me to stick to any routine. I always tried to be consistent with habits but it always falls apart (yoga in the morning, journaling every day, meditating...).

\- I have bad days in which I don't do anything at all. Usually once a week. If I'm on my period it's the first 3 days... So all in all there are several days in a month in which I am not functional.

\- I don't have much control over my time. This morning I spent 3h in bed before I decided to have breakfast. Then I spent an hour drafting this post even though I had to go to uni like an hour ago. Last week I went on a cleaning spree after throwing the trash (like, deep cleaning).

\- I am gifted (diagnosed) - I think there's an overlap with ADHD? There are many things that I always attributed to being gifted that seem to resonate with ADHD too. For example: being multipassionate and having many hobbies, learning a lot of stuff, the hyper focus, getting excited over particular things (highlighting in colors, organizing a Notion/Obsidian/Tana), getting into rabbit holes...

I think I mask quite well and got around all of these ""inconveniences"" so I've always been told (by friends) I don't have ADHD (or that ADHD isn't real) and I don't need medication. But I recently started dating someone and spending a lot of time with him - through his eyes I'm discovering the huge impact that this has on my life and others. I don't like being this forgetful to the point that it seems carelessness or inattentiveness. And I've been working with ""my ways"" for so many years now. I'm more functional than ever but it requires a lot of effort, planning and discipline, and my systems fall apart often.

I'm also pursuing a PhD (6 months in) and I feel terribly guilty on my bad days. I'm not doing enough hours (it's supposed to be full time and I barely do 20h/week - I track my time), and I find it really hard to concentrate. When I'm focused and in the zone I can do a lot and be super productive, but maybe that's only one day in a week, and I can't force it. When I sit in the office everything bothers me (others coming in or out, coughing, small sounds...). But if I'm focused I'm suddenly deaf and I don't notice anything.

Anyway... I wanted to hear your opinions. Am I less functional than I thought I am? Would my life drastically change with medication? Should I seek a professional diagnosis?

Edit to add (after browsing the subreddit): I procrastinate / avoid a lot, and I've struggled with fatigue all my life. I have low levels of energy, sometimes at night I feel as if I was getting sick but I'm just tired. Vitamins and iron were always ok.",1,1745404428.0,adhdwomen,4,1.0,False

I know those ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored, let‚Äôs be friends!‚Äù posts are everywhere, and I usually roll my eyes too‚Ä¶ but here I am, eating my words and hoping to find someone cool to vibe with. That said, boredom aside, I‚Äôm still serious about finding genuine, long-term friendships. Not here for short bursts of small talk‚ÄîI want that comfy, consistent connection where we actually enjoy talking to each other.

Eventually, I‚Äôd love to move to Discord, hang out while you game (I‚Äôm not a gamer, but I love watching and hyping people up like their personal fan club), and just chill over voice calls. Daily audio chats? Yes please. I‚Äôd rather talk than text‚Äîit‚Äôs just more me.

I‚Äôm a coffee girl through and through‚Äîespecially iced orange americano. I pretend I don‚Äôt like lattes, but pistachio and this recent butter latte totally have me in a chokehold. I‚Äôm also dangerously obsessed with Japanese jiggly pancakes, the kind with fresh cream and fruit that make you feel like you're chewing on a cloud. I love anime and anything animated, and bookstores feel like a sacred place to me. I don‚Äôt have a cat yet, but I daydream about having one just so I can hug it until it files a restraining order (with love, of course). And yes, I‚Äôm that person who watches ASMR spa and hair treatment videos for relaxation. Don‚Äôt knock it till you try it‚Äîit‚Äôs pure bliss.

I‚Äôm looking for friends who are 29 and above, who are down to actually build something meaningful over time. Start with a classic ASL if you want (yes, we‚Äôre bringing it back), and tell me a little about yourself. Bonus points if you're weird in the best way.

Let‚Äôs make boredom fun again and turn it into the start of something cozy and cool.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Gathering the Ingredients for Your Cheesecake Ice Cream Cake

To create a scrumptious cheesecake ice cream cake recipe without turning on the oven, you‚Äôll need a set of simple ingredients that come together quickly and taste fantastic. Here‚Äôs everything you need before starting:

- Crushed graham crackers or digestive biscuits (about 2 cups)
- Melted unsalted butter (6 tablespoons)
- Cream cheese (16 ounces), softened
- Powdered sugar (3/4 cup)
- Vanilla extract (1 teaspoon)
- Heavy whipping cream (1 cup)
- Your choice of ice cream (1.5 quarts) ‚Äì vanilla or a complementary flavor works best
- Optional toppings: fresh fruit, chocolate shavings, caramel sauce, or crushed nuts

Having these ingredients prepped and ready will make assembling your dessert fast and stress-free.

### Preparing the Crust: The Foundation of Your Cake

Start by creating a rich and crunchy crust that holds your cheesecake ice cream cake together perfectly. Take the crushed graham crackers and combine them with melted butter in a mixing bowl. Stir until the crumbs are fully coated with butter and feel like wet sand.

Press this mixture firmly into the base of a springform pan or a deep round cake pan. Use the back of a spoon or bottom of a flat glass to create an even, compact layer. This step is essential to provide a sturdy foundation for the soft ice cream and cheesecake layers.

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
Once the crust is evenly pressed, place the pan in the freezer to chill for about 15-20 minutes. This helps the butter set, ensuring the crust doesn‚Äôt crumble when you cut into your cake later.

### Crafting the No-Bake Cheesecake Layer

While the crust chills, begin making the creamy cheesecake filling. In a large bowl, beat the softened cream cheese with powdered sugar and vanilla extract until it‚Äôs smooth and lump-free. For the fluffiest texture, whip the heavy cream in a separate bowl until stiff peaks form.

Gently fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture. This creates a light, airy layer that mimics the richness and creaminess of traditional cheesecake without baking.

Spread this cheesecake mixture evenly over the chilled crust. Smooth the surface with a spatula, creating a nice even layer ready to support the ice cream topping.

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
### Adding the Ice Cream Layer Without the Fuss

Choose your favorite ice cream to layer on top. Vanilla pairs wonderfully with the cheesecake flavors, but you can get creative with chocolate, strawberry, or even caramel swirl.

Allow the ice cream to soften slightly at room temperature for about 5-10 minutes so it‚Äôs easier to spread. Once ready, spread it evenly over the cheesecake layer. Don‚Äôt worry if it doesn‚Äôt look perfect at this point ‚Äì the freezing process will firm it up beautifully.

After assembling the layers, cover the entire cake with plastic wrap or a tight-fitting lid. Place it back in the freezer for a minimum of 4 hours, or preferably overnight. This allows all flavors to meld and the cake to set properly for clean slicing.

### Tips for Serving Your Cheesecake Ice Cream Cake

- Before slicing, remove the cake from the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. This softens the ice cream slightly, making it easier to cut.
- Use a hot knife for smooth and clean slices. Run the knife under warm water between cuts for best results.
- Garnish each slice with fresh berries, a drizzle of chocolate sauce, or crushed nuts to enhance both the look and flavor.
- This dessert can be stored in the freezer for up to one week. Keep it well-wrapped to prevent freezer burn and maintain flavor.

Crafting a no-bake cheesecake ice cream cake offers a fantastic opportunity to get creative with flavors and textures. This dessert is versatile, allowing you to tailor it to your taste preferences or occasion. With a few simple tips and clever variations, you can transform a basic recipe into a standout treat that delights every guest.

### Using Different Ice Cream Flavors

The ice cream flavor you choose can significantly change the cake's personality. While vanilla is classic and complements the cheesecake layer beautifully, don't hesitate to experiment with other flavors. Consider:

- **Strawberry or Raspberry:** These fruity choices add a refreshing contrast and vibrant color.
- **Mint Chocolate Chip:** Introduces a cool, minty bite with chocolate flecks.
- **Salted Caramel:** Adds a slightly sweet and salty richness that pairs well with the creamy cheesecake layer.
- **Cookies and Cream:** Enhances the crunch factor when combined with an Oreo crust.

Mixing and matching two or more flavors in different layers also creates a visually inviting and tastefully complex dessert.

### Enhancing the Crust Base

The crust provides the foundation and a textural balance to the creamy layers. Traditional recipes often use graham cracker crumbs, but consider swapping this for:

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
- **Oreo Crumbs:** Perfect for a chocolatey twist and a slightly denser texture.
- **Gingersnap Cookies:** Adds warmth and spice, ideal for fall-themed desserts.
- **Nuts and Dates:** For a gluten-free option, blend nuts like almonds or pecans with dates to create a sticky, flavorful crust.
- **Shortbread Cookies:** Offers a buttery, crumbly base that pairs beautifully with sweeter ice creams.

Don‚Äôt forget to press the crumbs firmly into your pan to ensure the crust holds together well once chilled.

### Mix-Ins and Swirls

Adding mix-ins or swirls to the cheesecake or ice cream layers can elevate the texture and flavor profiles. Some creative ideas include:

- **Chocolate Chips or Chunks:** These provide delightful surprises in every bite.
- **Fruit Purees or Jam Swirls:** Swirling raspberry or blueberry puree into the cheesecake layer adds a tangy pop.
- **Crushed Candy Bars:** Adds a crunchy, sweet dimension perfect for celebrations.
- **Toffee Bits or Caramel Sauce Drizzles:** These create pockets of gooey sweetness throughout the cake.

Layer these additions by gently folding them into the cheesecake mixture or layering them strategically on top or between ice cream layers.

### Alternative Dairy and Sweetener Options

For those wanting to adjust the recipe according to dietary preferences or allergies, simple swaps can keep your cake just as delicious:

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã  
  
- **Dairy-Free Ice Cream:** Coconut, almond, or oat milk-based ice creams offer great non-dairy substitutes.
- **Vegan Cream Cheese:** Easily replaces traditional cream cheese in the cheesecake layer.
- **Natural Sweeteners:** Use honey, maple syrup, or agave instead of refined sugar for a more wholesome taste.

These adaptations make the dessert accessible to more people without sacrificing flavor.

### Top It Off with Creative Toppings

Finishing your no-bake cheesecake ice cream cake with the right toppings can turn it from simple to spectacular. Consider these options:

- **Fresh Berries:** Blueberries, raspberries, or sliced strawberries not only brighten the plate but enhance the fruity undertones.
- **Whipped Cream or Coconut Whip:** Adds a light, airy texture that complements the richness.
- **Chocolate Ganache or Hot Fudge Sauce:** Drizzled over the top, it adds an indulgent touch.
- **Toasted Nuts or Shredded Coconut:** Provide a nutty crunch and attractive finish.

Layering multiple toppings can create a stunning presentation and exciting textural contrast.

### Adapting the Cake for Special Occasions

Tailoring your cheesecake ice cream cake to fit holidays or celebrations is easy. For instance:

‚Äã Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ‚Äã

- Add pastel-colored candy or edible flowers for springtime birthdays or baby showers.
- Incorporate coffee-flavored ice cream and chocolate cookie crust for a sophisticated adult dessert.

These thoughtful touches make your no-bake dessert not only taste great but also feel personalized.

### Tips for Perfect Assembling and Serving

To achieve the best results with your no-bake cheesecake ice cream cake:

- Line your pan with parchment paper for easy removal once frozen.
- Allow the cheesecake layer to set properly before adding ice cream‚Äîthis prevents blending of layers.
- Press toppings gently to ensure they stick but don‚Äôt sink into softer layers.

This is coming from someone who used to drink 6 or 7 cups of coffee a day for years, throughout my 20s and 30s. Now I‚Äôm at zero and I feel better than I have in ages.

I keep wondering... it can‚Äôt just be the coffee, can it?",20,1745403832.0,decaf,1,0.96,False

I Feel Amazing.","It‚Äôs been five weeks since I gave up coffee well, except for one slip-up where I gave in to a craving, had a cup, and instantly regretted it. Aside from that, I‚Äôve stayed off it completely. I was so close to caving this past weekend, but I held firm and I‚Äôm glad I did.

The changes I‚Äôve noticed are wild.

I recently found $WHITE from the WhiteRock ecosystem‚Äîcaught my attention because they have a debit card that lets you spend tokenized assets like cash. Literally you can use it to buy coffee. Kinda wild seeing crypto finally working like that.

I put a small bag in already, but wanted to ask‚Äîdid I make a decent move? Anyone else looking at RWA projects lately?
