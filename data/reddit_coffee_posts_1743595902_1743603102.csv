In my free time I like to read, go on long walks, see cat videos. And there's so much more 😅
Sometimes I just sit with a cup of coffee and daydream about everything and nothing at all.

 My journey so far: 1 tried out at first with some Bombe beans freshly grinded with my DF54, grinding in a range from 10 to 5. The beans where roasted for filter coffee and I still didn't have the chance to take my hands on any additional tool, so I just gave a try with the plastic tamper and the filter basket included in the box.

 l've now moved to a IMS Big Bang 23.5h filter, Ali Express WDT and Tamper with spring + dosing funnel and to some epresso roasted beans from The Barn. I first tried to pull some shots with a grind size around 5 (something like 6 or 7) and nothing was coming out.

 After that, I tried to pull a shot with a grind size of 1 1-12, and I was able to see coffee coming down with a reasonable flow, omogenous extraction throughout the whole extraction that ended at 35.6g in aroun 25 seconds.

 The crema on top was looking good and didn't break apart when touched with the spoon.
 However, when I took the portafilter out, I noticed something super strange: the puck grew a lot in contact with the water and actually expanded outside the basket.

 Also, the shot was terribly bitter.

Hey future CRNAs! Jumping into CRNA school is a big leap forward in your career, and it’s crucial to understand what it’s going to take—not just in terms of the time and dedication, but also the financial investment.

Whether you’re crunching numbers to budget for the next few years or just curious about how much you’ll need to invest in your education, we’ve got you covered.

In this post, we’ll break down CRNA school costs like tuition and cost of attendance – and what the difference is – plus we’ll touch on financial aid options and offer some insider tips on managing your finances while in school. 

So, grab a cup of coffee, and let’s get into the nitty-gritty of CRNA school costs!

# Understanding CRNA School Tuition

When considering CRNA school, the financial differences between public and private institutions can play a significant role. Public universities often offer more affordable tuition, thanks to state funding, which benefits those who qualify as state residents.

For example, the [University of Tennessee Health Science Center](https://uthsc.edu/nursing/dnp/crna.php) charges about $59,000 for in-state students, which is considerably less expensive compared to its out-of-state tuition at around [$135,000](https://uthsc.edu/finance/bursar/fees/index.php).

Private institutions, while typically more costly due to lack of state subsidies, can sometimes offer perks such as smaller class sizes and potentially more resources or faculty members per student. 

These advantages could be crucial in a demanding field like nurse anesthesia.

Take [Duke University](https://nursing.duke.edu/academic-programs/dnp-program-nursing/nurse-anesthesia-dnp): the Nurse Anesthesia DNP program at Duke University School of Nursing costs [approximately $95,000](https://nursing.duke.edu/academic-programs/dnp-program-nursing/nurse-anesthesia-dnp/crna-tuition-fees), but its strong reputation and network can be beneficial for those who seek it. Keep in mind though- smaller cohort sizes can sometimes equate to higher [competition](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/podcast/episode-157-how-competitive-is-crna-school-in-2024/) for admission! 

Another important factor in determining CRNA school costs like tuition and living expenses is location. 

CRNA programs in major metropolitan areas, like Philadelphia or Atlanta, might provide exceptional opportunities but can also come with higher costs.

It’s important to note that CRNA school tuition costs can and do vary widely by program, ranging from around $20,000 ([InterAmerican University](https://www.arecibo.inter.edu/department/dnap/)) to closer to $200,000. 

Here’s a snapshot of tuition details for some CRNA schools to give you an idea:

[**Samford University**](https://www.samford.edu/nursing/nurse-anesthesia)**, Birmingham, AL**: DNP program costing $102,000.

[**University of Alabama at Birmingham**](https://www.uab.edu/nursing/home/academics/doctoral/dnp/bsn-to-dnp-nurse-anesthesia)**, AL**: The UAB DNP program costs around $88,770 for in-state students, and $191,400 for out-of-state students.

[**University of Mobile**](https://umobile.edu/school-of-nurse-anesthesia/)**, AL**: DNAP program at $99,000.

[**Midwestern University**](https://www.midwestern.edu/academics/degrees-programs/college-health-sciences/doctor-nurse-anesthesia-entry-practice-program)**, Glendale, AZ**: DNAP program costing $157,00.

[**University of Arizona**](https://www.nursing.arizona.edu/academics/doctor-nursing-practice-dnp/specialties/nurse-anesthesiology)**, Tucson, AZ**: Nurse Anesthesiology DNP program costing $120,500.

[**Arkansas State University**](https://www.astate.edu/degrees/dnp-nurse-anesthesia)**, Jonesboro, AR**: DNP program at $58,700.

[**University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences**](https://nursing.uams.edu/future-students/programs/dnp/nurse-anesthesia/)**, Little Rock, AR**: DNP program costing $74,500 for in-state and $107,500 for out-of-state students.

[**California State University Fullerton/ Kaiser Permanente School of Anesthesia**](https://kpsan.org/)**, Pasadena, CA**: DNP Nurse Anesthesia program costs around $94,000 for in-state and $137,500 for out-of-state students.

[**Loma Linda University**](https://nursing.llu.edu/programs/certified-registered-nurse-anesthetist-crna)**, CA**: DNP program costing $139,000.

[**National University**](https://www.nu.edu/degrees/nursing/programs/doctor-of-nurse-anesthesia-practice-dnap/)**, Fresno, CA**: DNAP program costing $116,200.

Understanding these variables can help you make well-informed decisions about your graduate school plans that align with both your budget and career objectives.

When considering a CRNA school, the financial differences between public and private institutions can play a significant role.

# Additional Expenses When Going to Nurse Anesthesia School

As you prepare for CRNA school, it’s essential to consider the full range of costs beyond tuition. In addition to the sometimes costly tuition fees, you’ll need to budget for books, supplies like stethoscopes and scrubs, and possibly even specialized software or hardware to meet the demands of your coursework. 

Many CSPA students recommend laptops, iPads or even both while in CRNA school!

These additional costs are crucial to consider as you plan your CRNA journey, so you can focus on your studies without the added stress of unforeseen expenses. 

As you may already know, these supplies can vary widely in cost- and the expenses don’t stop there.

Application costs also add up quickly. Each CRNA school charges an application fee, typically ranging from $50 to $100.

Additionally, obtaining your [CCRN certification](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/podcast/episode-96-getting-the-ccrn-for-crna-school-with-nicole-kupchik), a common requirement for application, can cost around $335 for non-members of the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses ([AACN](https://www.aacn.org/)), and slightly less for members.

If you need to take the [GRE](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/podcast/should-you-take-the-gre-for-crna-school-plus-get-a-free-magoosh-practice-test), there are fees associated with that exam as well. You may even incur costs for sending your academic transcripts to multiple programs… even if they’re only a few dollars each, sending in multiple transcripts to multiple schools can add up quickly!

Last but not least! Make sure you have enough in savings to cover your seat deposit.

Yep! Once you’re accepted into a program, you may be required to make a deposit to secure your spot, which can be another significant expense. 

Some schools may require you to put down $1,000 – $2,000, or more, to secure your spot in a cohort once you’ve been accepted.

Pro tip- You may be asked in your [CRNA school interview](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/blog-your-crna-interview-matters-most) about financial readiness and plan for finances- especially since you oftentimes can’t work while you’re in CRNA school.

I want to expand on the cost of living and its effects on CRNA school costs. 

# Cost of Attendance and Cost of Living

When planning for CRNA school, don’t just stare at the tuition fees—take a good look at the overall COA in the area your school is in. The Cost of Attendance (COA) isn’t just about tuition; it includes your living expenses, travel costs, books, and all those extras.

Think about everything from where you’ll live to how you’ll get around. Getting a handle on these real-world costs can keep you from some nasty financial surprises and let you focus on your studies instead of your bank account.

Urban areas like L.A. or Washington D.C. might offer some top-notch programs, but they also come with a higher price tag for just about everything else—rent, groceries, you name it.

The COA set for your CRNA school will also determine financial aid. Chatting with your desired program(s) financial aid department is advised for those looking for more details into COA specifics for each program.

Another aspect of overall CRNA school costs are called Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA). These are a big deal because they impact how much you need to budget beyond tuition. 

Moving to a city with a high COLA means every dollar you spend doesn’t stretch as far, especially compared to more rural or less expensive areas of the country.

It’s essential to weigh these additional cost factors as they could dictate not just your lifestyle but also [how much debt](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/podcast/episode-165-how-much-debt-will-you-be-in-after-crna-school) you might be taking on.

Don’t be afraid to look at CRNA school as an investment in yourself and your future! Your [salary as a CRNA](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/blog-crna-salary-how-much-money-do-crnas-make-2) will certainly be worth it but choosing where to go for CRNA school isn’t just about picking the best program—it’s also about where it’s located and how that’s going to affect your wallet. 

Speaking of affecting your wallet, let’s touch briefly on Financial Aid and paying for CRNA school.

# Paying for CRNA School

Navigating how to pay for CRNA school doesn’t have to be overwhelming. Let’s break it down:Federal student loans are a go-to due to their lower interest rates and flexible repayment terms, but they might not cover everything. 

That’s where private student loans come into play. They fill the gaps but often need a co-signer because, let’s face it, most students aren’t pulling in a steady income during their studies.

Federal vs. Private Student Loans: Federal loans are generally more favorable, but private loans can help when federal funds fall short.

If you’re looking for alternatives, state-based student loans could be a gem. They often come with lower interest rates and no pesky origination fees—if they’re available in your state, that is. Always worth a check to see what your state offers or if the state where your program is located has these perks.

Stepping away from traditional loans, a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) might be your wild card. It works like a credit card, giving you access to funds based on your home equity, which can be super flexible but means keeping an eye on those repayment terms.

Then there’s the possibility of employer or military sign-on bonuses, which can significantly lower your education costs if you’re comfortable with committing to a service period after graduation. 

These options not only help with tuition but might also throw in some perks like health benefits or monthly stipends.

**Key points to consider:**

1. **Federal vs. Private Student Loans: Federal loans are generally more favorable, but private loans can help when federal funds fall short.**
2. **Co-signer Requirements: For most private and personal loans, having a co-signer is part of the deal.**
3. **HELOC Advantages: Offers great flexibility and immediate fund access, perfect for unexpected school or living expenses.**
4. **Employer and Military Benefits: These can offer significant financial relief but come with contacts and/or service commitments.**
5. **Loan Repayment Options: Explore possibilities like employer repayment plans or sign-on bonuses that could lighten your debt load after graduation.**

# Long Term Payoff and Return on Investment

If you’re not aware, Nurse Anesthesia is one of the highest paid [specialties](https://crnaschoolprepacademy.com/blog-what-is-a-dnp-what-is-a-dnap-is-there-a-difference-between-dnp-vs-dnap) you can go into as a nurse. With salaries coming in over $200,000 a year, it’s no doubt that the return on your investment is there. Plus, you’ll love the autonomy and direct patient care you’ll experience as a Nurse Anesthetist!

# Conclusion

Embarking on your journey to becoming a CRNA is thrilling and, yes, a bit daunting when you look at the costs involved. But with the right planning and resources, you can navigate this path without breaking the bank.

Remember, investing in your education is investing in your future—not just in terms of earnings but in the quality of care you’ll provide as a highly skilled CRNA.

I’ll be honest—I’m not looking for a temporary connection. I want something real. Something that lasts. A love where we both choose each other, every day, no matter what. I want to be that person who makes your life softer, happier, and filled with warmth, and I want you to be the same for me.

A little about me? I’m 18, but don’t mistake that for immaturity—I think deeply, love intensely, and dream endlessly. I’m a nerd in the best ways—obsessed with tech, physics, and learning. I love movies, music, long walks, and talking about anything and everything for hours. I’m also starting a new phase of my life—working on my health, my passions, my future. A fresh start, and maybe you could be part of it?

I’ve always been drawn to women older than me, but age isn’t the deciding factor—connection is. Your race, background, or looks don’t matter to me. What matters is you—your mind, your heart, the way you see the world.

But before you message me, let’s make this interesting. Don’t just say “Hi.” Tell me something—your favorite quote, a movie that made you cry, a song that feels like home to you. Make me curious about you. After all, if this is the start of something special, it deserves a better opening line than just “Hey.”

So, wherever you are, if this speaks to you—if you’ve been searching too—then maybe… you found me. And I found you.",2,1743602284.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I'd all but given up, until the 'Buy Canadian' movement made me decide to do some online searching for Canadian brands.

I found one... and it's AMAZING. OK, so I've only tried 2 products, but one of those products is my new every day go-to. 

The company is [vita-plus.ca](http://vita-plus.ca) and the product I tried was their bulk whey protein isolate, Coffee Wafer flavour. It's like drinking a coffee crisp milkshake! They also do fruit flavoured clear protein isolates and so many different flavours. 

They seem to be a very small company, based out of Quebec, so if you're a consumer of protein powders please check them out and give them some support!

I noticed that the list had ""Blood Raf Coffee"" in it, so I got curious and went in to check it out. Turns out they would actually take some of your blood and add it in some way to your coffee. They told me they needed 15 ml.

They first tried to take my blood in one room with a syringe, but they poked me in the middle of my forearm and didn't manage to find a vein (which is accurate to real life, I always have trouble giving blood...).

They then sent me to another room where a different barista-nurse tried to take my blood. I remember she had a voluminous curly bob with bangs and thick-rimmed black glasses.

Anyway, she agreed to take blood out of my good vein on my right wrist, but instead of a syringe she used some sort of small tool that I assume doesn't exist irl. It looked a little like a small horseshoe, but on both of it's ends were little sharp blades. To take my blood, she squeezed the tool so that the two ends would cross, then inserted it into my vein and let go, so that the tiny blades would cut their way out of my vein.

Then the blood started slowly pouring out of the wound, but it didn't look like regular dark blood, it looked light and translucent, like strawberry syrup. For some reason it also had white streaks of what looked like melted ice cream mixed in it...

The nurse and I just kept staring as it was pouring out, but she wasn't trying to collect her 15 ml, so the pool of syrupy blood on the table was getting bigger, and I started getting uncomfortable because, after all, I was bleeding out.

Eventually I got too queasy and woke up, so after all the trouble, I didn't even get to taste the drink :/",3,1743602158.0,somnigastronomy,0,1.0,False

My girlfriend (27) and I (33) have been together for almost 6 months. In that time she has lied to me about a few things that I didn’t deem incredibly serious, it was more about the fact that she lied than the details. In one scenario she lied about her history with a guy that she was snap chatting every day (I felt he was inappropriate in conversation, discussing his sex life and from my perspective subtly flirting. I didn’t ask that she end her friendship just that it be kept off Snapchat and friendly) - at another point she lied about her history with certain activities, which I understood in regards to feeling shameful. We’ve all done things we aren’t proud of. It just came down to lying as the main issue.

I’ve repeatedly begged her not to lie, expressed that we can talk about these things even if it’s a difficult conversation we can work things out but if I’m lied to my trust is broken and I spiral. It isn’t my first rodeo, I know myself and how hard it becomes when you have to question the things your partner tells you. 

She works at a coffee shop, she has had people hit on her, of course she’s an attractive woman. She always tells me when this happens to be upfront and I actually really appreciate this because it gives me an opportunity to feel that she is being very open with me despite something possibly being somewhat uncomfortable. Yesterday I found out she had added a new guy on Instagram, apparently he is the plumber for the shop. She didn’t mention this like she usually does and I was waiting to hear from her directly, so I waited, but she never mentioned it. My impatience got the better at me and I began giving subtle hints to prod her into mentioning it. Eventually she did, but left out having exchanged socials. When I asked outright, knowing the answer, she denied adding him on insta. Going so far as to in the moment jump on Instagram, unfollow him, send me a screenshot and say “see? I didn’t!” At this point I’m like wtf is going on. Why, if there is nothing going on here would you have lied about something so stupid? 

Eventually she owned up to it, adding him and lying about it. She denies that there was anything more to it. Saying that she is a people pleaser, didn’t want to disappoint me (I guess by adding a guy? Which didn’t make sense to me, we both have friends of the opposite sex and it wouldn’t have been a big deal if she hadn’t lied about it) I feel like there must be more to this, and I can’t shake that feeling.

2. A comma in a sentence indicates a pause, not an end. Likewise, in life, God may be calling you, but there might be pauses, shifts, or waiting periods before you step into your full purpose.
3. People often define us by the roles we play in their lives—friend, leader, mentor, spouse, etc. But true identity comes from God, not from external validation.
4. Just because something works doesn't mean it's working the right way. God may be waiting for you to recognize the correct way to use your gifts.
5. Sometimes, setbacks or failures are indicators that a shift is about to happen. Instead of seeing a fall as the end, see it as a setup for what’s next.
6. Before God opens new doors, He often wants us to maximize what’s already in our hands (like Moses and his staff in Exodus 4:2).
7. God operates on His divine schedule, not ours. Waiting doesn’t necessarily mean denial—it might be mean preparation.
8. Don’t give up on yourself or others before God makes the final call. Keep moving forward, even when you don’t fully understand the process. Trust at the right time, everything will align perfectly.
9. Your calling may not be unfolding how you expect, but God is still working through it Romans (8:28). Callings Have Commas, Not Periods.
10. God’s timing is precise, even when it feels delayed (Habakkuk 2:3). Timing is Everything.
11. A Fall is a Signal, Not a Failure. Your setback is proof that your comeback is near (Proverbs 24:16).
12. When God is ready, nothing can stop it—but don’t let delay make you doubt.
13. Our roles in life shift, but who we are remains the same. I'm a son, a father, and a husband—all at the same time. I don’t cease to be one when you operate in another role.
14. Your child calls you Dad because they need a father. So if you relied on people to define you, your identity would be fragmented. Only God is big enough to name you completely.
15. Instead of seeking the approval of people, ask: ""God, what have You named me?"" Instead of feeling torn by shifting roles, embrace the fullness of your identity in Him.
16. Just as a comma shifts but does not end a sentence, your life is shifting, but your calling is continuous. The world will call you based on their needs, but God calls you based on His purpose.
17. Just because something ""works"" doesn't mean it's working the right way. We must align with God's way. You don't put a period where God put a comma—your purpose is still unfolding.
18. God is Jehovah Jireh (Provider), Jehovah Rapha (Healer), and Jehovah Shalom (Peace), but He is still one God, and none of these names fully defined Him; He is the great ""I AM"" (Exodus 3:14).

I was on 400 mgs of Modofodil and then they took me off of MOD and just put me on (short acting) ADD 5mlg to see how I would do. With anyone on this forum, I presume yall know 5mg ADD  from 400mg of MOD is not a lot and it has been hell. I have had a sleep spell every day. 

My doctor wanted to go slow since I have other conditions which make adderal a tricky medication, hence the insane low dose for severe narcolepsy. I was approved to go to 10mg / start with a combo of short acting and low acting soon which I am extremely grateful for. However, I will probs not get the meds until Friday as the prescription has not come in and I have a huge day tomorrow and I do not want to risk side effects. 

  
I am wondering how people others deal with medication adjustments. I have a huge job interview on Thursday and I am trying to prepare for it while being exhausted. I have been drinking copious amounts of coffee but I was wondering if there are specific foods, energy drinks, etc that helps yall get through the day.  My doctor recommended I take a second dose of ADD in the afternoon to offset the short life of the drug, but my memory is bad. For those who just take adderal, do you take one dose/ how much? How do you remind yourself to take the medication? Do you try to take it at a specific time in the morning for it to be more effective? With modafodil I always tried to take it on the earlier side but I am realizing that is not really working with adderal. 

  
I hope it is obvious I am asking for just advise about a medication I am prescribed! I am more just looking for advise from the narclpetic community about how to deal with the affects of med adjustments!",1,1743601856.0,Narcolepsy,1,1.0,False

Alright, folks, let’s get real for a sec. Have you ever felt like your perfectly planned schedule was suffocating your creativity? I mean, seriously, we've all been there, right? You're blocking out every minute of your day, thinking it’s the Holy Grail of productivity hacks, and yet... all you're left with is a blank page and zero creative juices. **Sound familiar?** 🙋‍♂️

I was there just last week. Monday morning, coffee in hand, I stared at my calendar in horror—my entire day carefully color-coded down to the minute. Did I feel super organized? Heck yes. But creative? Not in the slightest. *There I was, a prisoner of my own making.* Time-blocking felt like trying to compose a symphony while counting every single note. 🎷

**Here’s what I discovered (and it’s so simple, it’s genius):**

- **The 10-Minute Break Hack**: For every hour you plan, schedule 10 minutes to do... absolutely nothing. Seriously, nothing productive at least. Let your mind wander, doodle, stare into space like a cat judging humanity from the window. 🐱 Why? Because sometimes, creativity needs a little breathing room to find you when you’re not searching for it like a lost sock.

- **Unblock Your Creativity**: Why not try **blocking less** than 50% of your time and leaving the rest open-ended? This might sound like chaos, especially if you’re a fan of ticking off boxes, but *trust me*, creativity often knocks when you’re busy doing something—gasp—not on your schedule.

- **Mix Up Your Routine**: How about swapping your morning deep-dive for an impromptu walk in nature or, dare I say, blasting your favorite playlist and having a five-minute dance party? 🕺💃 Creative sparks often fly from the most unexpected places.

**Funny story time:** One day, after a couple of hours of mind-numbing “productive” labour, I popped outside for a quick breather. Five minutes into smelling the flowers (literally and figuratively), BAM, it hit me—a solution to a problem I had been brooding over all morning.

Isn't it weird how the brain works? Why battle with the clock when you could be weaving through inspiration's whimsical paths? Who knew those ten-minute ""do-nothings"" could actually do so much? 🤯

And some herbs can't be clashed with some medication. There's also side effects and every experience is different for everyone.]

Before I start listing the problems I have I just want to say I've had these problems almost my whole life since I was about 6 years old or even younger idk and I'm 20 now and I'm going insane I don't think I'll be able to live a proper life or get a Job because of it. 

What I do know is that exercising, therapy, meditation, eating well, sleeping well, journaling, getting out more and going outside and stop drinking things like coffee can help. Also I've never done any drugs or drunk alcohol or anything like that. I've also never been to a doctor before to check these type of stuff yet so I don't know what's wrong with me but I will soon hopefully.

So what do people use for these or has helped and what difference has it made (physically and mentally)

-racing heartbeat 
-sweating 
Thinking negative all the time and asking what if questions all the time 
-tight chest sometimes it feels like a shoe lace is being tied around my heart or something 
-Sometimes I feel like I can't breathe even though I can but it feels like I want to fall or feel dizzy for a few moments 
-That weird lump feeling in my throat. Sometimes I think I'm dehydrated but even when I drink lots of water it's still there
-social anxiety 
-fear of eye contact 
-overthinking thoughts from years ago or even weeks ago over and over again 
-always having thoughts at the back of your head but even when you try to distract yourself it's still in your head and you want it to go away forever 

I know this is a lot and might not find a solution for everything. 

Sometimes I just want to think of nothing and let my brain and thoughts be empty in in the present moment with whatever I'm doing like if I'm doing homework I should think of homework not an argument that happened two years ago or thinking about a fire that happened a week ago and then having these repetitive thoughts about it over and over again even though it did not affect me in any way

1jposmr,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1jposmr/it_creeps_on_all_fours/,It Creeps On All Fours,"While the news droned on about cyber attacks, immigrants, and trade deals, a different sort of migrant quietly crossed the border and took up residence in suburban America.



These migrants crept on all fours and dwelled in the brush, the culverts, and the drains, biding their time until the sun went down and they could emerge, cautiously, into the wild, concrete environment.



The ecosystem of overgrown roadsides and dense, invasive forests was suddenly quiet. The crows stopped cawing and the coyotes went silent in their dens. 



A new creature reigned.



The first attacks went unnoticed. A dog here, a vagrant there.



Those first attacks weren’t reported on local news. In fact, they weren’t reported at all.



Absorbed in the political maelstrom gripping the nation, small stories no longer packed the punch needed to keep approval ratings high. And even though people were missing, missing persons stories only mattered when they were the *right* people.



The average person didn’t notice when the migrants stopped coming to work, or when the homeless vanished from the streets.



But they did notice when their cat didn’t come home, which was the first strange thing Jake Anderson detected that Friday morning. 



He spent Saturday pulling his weepy toddler around in a wagon, her small sister marching beside them, as they hung up fliers with “HAVE YOU SEEN THIS CAT?” printed across the top in large letters. Underneath was a blurry photo and their phone number. 



The telephone poles were plastered with weathered flyers of missing pets- and people, he noticed suddenly, with a shiver. 



He was glad his daughters couldn’t read.



That evening he opened his computer. The headlines were clogged with toxic geopolitical nightmares, even on the locals. Nothing pointing to an abundance of missing persons in sleepy Glendale, Indiana.



But then he turned to social media, where he found an outpouring of fear and longing from the nearly defunct message boards. Turns out it wasn’t just Glendale experiencing this. A surge in pet (and human) disappearances seemed to be affecting nearly every community statewide.



But it wasn’t just the disappearances. There was talk of something else. 



A disease, spread by wild animals.



Some people became delusional and feverish.



Some people’s eyes changed color, or their hair fell out.



Some people *died.*



“Daddy! Look!”



Startled, he glanced up from his computer. His daughter stood in the doorway. Behind her was a lurking, mangy shadow.



His coffee cup slipped from his hand and shattered on the floor.



It was a wolf. Had to be. He’d only seen them on *Planet Earth,* but there was no mistaking it. It was an enormous, shaggy thing, dwarfing his young daughter. Drool dangled from its lips. Its eyes weeped yellow pus, and they had a glazed, silvery glint.



The same glint that now shone in his daughter’s eyes.



She reached out and patted the wolf’s patchy fur. 



“We don’t have to look for kitty anymore. Now we have a doggie.”

He’s incredibly sweet, thoughtful, and we get along really well. We’ve been going on a lot of dates—dinners, movies, a few weekend trips—and I was really starting to see potential in him.

From the beginning, he always insisted on paying, and whenever I’d offer, he’d just smile and say, “We’ll handle it later, don’t worry about it.” I didn’t think much of it. On the rare occasions when I did pay, he’d always ask me how much I spent, which I found a little odd, but I just assumed he was particular about finances or something.

Then, out of nowhere, he texts me saying he’s a little tight on money and asks if I could send him some of what I “owe” him. I was confused because, as far as I knew, there was nothing I owed him. When I asked what he meant, he told me to download an app called Craify, where I’d be able to see all the expenses he’s tracked.

So, I download the app, and the moment I log in, I see every single dinner, coffee, Uber, and even a gas station stop listed under my name—with a total of $520 that I apparently “owe” him.

I was completely caught off guard. He never once mentioned that he was keeping track of everything. I thought he was treating me on these dates, and if he wanted to split costs, he should’ve said something before accumulating a tab. It felt less like a relationship and more like I’d unknowingly opened a line of credit with him.

I told him I wasn’t comfortable with this and that I wished he had communicated it upfront. He said he just assumed this was fair and that, since he grew up poor, he was always mindful of money. He wasn’t rude about it, just very matter-of-fact. But to me, it just changed the whole dynamic of our relationship.

I ended things with him and did not pay the $520. But now I feel a little guilty. Maybe I overreacted? Maybe this is just how he manages finances because of his background, and I should have been more understanding?

I ended up not completing my certificate for a few reasons, but still working at the salon as an assistant. My boss is aware that I did not finish my course and am not qualified.

I am on it for social anxiety, depression, and intrusive thoughts. The intrusive thoughts were triggered by a spiritual retreat that induced psychosis. The ringing in the ears seems to be a normal side effect and does not bother me because it happens at night while I’m going to bed and I don’t feel bothered by it. The decrease in hunger started months after starting it and has never gone away. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s weirdly challenging to force yourself to eat. It caused me to lose almost 20 pounds which is a lot for a 5’2” person so I’m now at 100 pounds. I feel a bit lazy and used to love to cook and would paint occasionally but now it seems like such a big chore and I’ve then eating lazy meals and skipping a lot of meals, which isn’t the healthiest. I just don’t feel physically hungry and there’s nothing that sounds good or that I crave. I also have not exercised in like a year and I used to go on walks or would run every so often and I just have zero desire. It seems like such a bother and I can’t even force myself to do it. I think this is all part of the Zoloft however I still have my emotions and I still cry and get angry and it hasn’t blunted my emotions. It has just blunted some of my pleasure activities, but I’m still content and working from home just fine and taking care of my dog just fine. But to relax I’ve just been watching a lot of shows and doing my work. I’m still having some intrusive thoughts though so it concerns me a little bit with weeding off because the few times I would forget for a few days they would come back and freak me out a little bit and also when I tried to wean off last month. I hit a wall of depression and social anxiety again which Was really rough around the time I started and it freaked me out. My psychiatrist wanted me to start decreasing to 100 from 150 and I asked if weaning slower would help and he said the science says to decrease in 50 but I ignore that advice and try to do 125 and after two weeks I got so discouraged by the depression and anxiety returning, which I guess is normal as you decrease it and should settle down but after feeling good for so long, I didn’t want to feel terrible again even for a little bit. 

I told my doctor that I wanted to stay on it for a little bit so that I could wean over the summer when I could exercise which could help balance it out, but he never responded. I do feel like it is time for me to decrease or wean because this carelessness with not really eating much and not being as motivated honestly to exercise or do errands I just feel content on a low level all the time so it’s a new feeling for me, but also makes it a bit hard to get things done. I love it for the social anxiety and most of the depression and probably need it for the intrusive thoughts because I don’t know if those are gonna return since I didn’t have them my whole life they were just triggered by that psychosis. 

I know a lot of people have gotten off Zoloft and went back on and people have so much trouble and on here most people end up just going back on it. But I’ve only been on for a year and it kind of is starting to impact my life even though it’s not in the worst way it’s kind of frustrating because I’ve been trying to pick up habits like journaling, walking cooking getting out of the house more and going to coffee shops, but I just have zero real motivation too even though it’s a desire that I want. I know it’s not a medicine that you really need to get off and that you can be on for a while and even through pregnancy and all that but it’s starting to hurt me a little bit then it’s helping me in this moment so I want to give it a shot.

I have a bunch of other ND supplements but those were the ones I am looking to try together soon and just wanted to know if they break a fast? 

Is there a general rule of thumb to tell if supplements break a fast? Like mushroom stuff probably does right? ChatGPT said the black ginger should probably be fine but might trigger nutrient-sensing pathways (whatever that means) if there's small amounts of plant compound.

Last fall I bought one of those classic disc golf umbrellas you see from the websites, and since then I’ve used the thing maybe a few times in non windy conditions. 

This morning I was walking to get some coffee, and since it was raining out I decided to use my fancy schmancy umbrella I barely use.
Unfortunately all it took was a single gust of 25 maybe 30 mph to destroy the thing. It blew a pretty decent headwind so I tipped it down so it wouldn’t get underneath, and in an effort to save the umbrella, I decided it was best to close it. When I tried that, all the plastic connecting points snapped, and that was the end of it. Mind you, I wasn’t fighting the wind to close it, as it was a head wind so it should’ve been easier to close. 

Taking a closer look at it, it seems that everything is made of plastic, so I suppose that’s on me for not deep diving into those details. I’ll be staying away from these branded umbrellas from now on, and I suggest you dudes all do too.

Traynor's face twisted into a tortured grimace as she pawed the table in *Normandy's* mess, desperately trying to find something in which to spit. She grabbed a napkin and fled to the aft corridor so her crewmates would only hear rather than see her undignified attempts to scrape off her tongue.

Garrus and Shepard remained at the table. They glanced at one another, then went back to their breakfasts with a mutual shrug as Traynor's gags echoed from around the corner.

Doctor Chakwas rushed from the infirmary, her expression full of concern. ""What happened? Is someone choking?"" Shepard pointed to Traynor's abandoned plate and the creme filled doughnut with a single bite taken out of it. The Doctor stared at it, then looked at both Shepard and Garrus with disappointment. ""Not your handiwork, I hope.""

""Wasn't me,"" Shepard said quickly.

""Honestly, Doctor,"" Garrus said, glancing at the tainted doughnut. ""That's beneath us.""

With a roll of her eyes, Chakwas hurried around the corner. ""Samantha? Are you all right?""

Garrus carved into his Remdius omelette with a fork. ""It wasn't you, was it?""

""Please,"" Shepard said.

""Just making sure.""

Cortez approached the table with a cup of coffee in hand. He reached for the tray of pastries in the middle of the table. ""Morning, sirs. What was that all about?""

Shepard sipped his own mug as Traynor's strangled coughs continued. ""Spiked doughnut, from the sound of it.""

Cortez pulled his hand back from the tray.

Traynor, still in the caring grip of Doctor Chakwas, re-appeared from around the bend. Tears streamed down her cheeks. ""I. HATE. MAYONNAISE! Whoever did this..."" She swiped her partially eaten doughnut from the table and stabbed the air with it to punctuate her words. ""When I find you, I'm going to force feed this to you, even if it's a year from now, and it's all fuzzy and disgusting!"" She spun on her heel to leave.

""Samantha?"" Garrus asked.

Traynor whirled around. ""What!""

""Don't forget to take your plate.""

""OH, GO CALIBRATE YOUR FACE!"" Traynor stormed around the corner. She reappeared a few seconds later to pick up her plate, stomped across the galley to drop it noisily in the sink, then marched back toward the central corridor with the tainted pastry still in hand. Doctor Chakwas raised her hands in surrender, then walked back to the infirmary.

The table fell silent. Shepard slurped from his mug again. ""Morning,"" he said.

""Morning,"" Garrus replied.

""Morning sirs,"" Cortez added, still looking a little unsettled.

Tali backed into the mess from the women's restroom with a fluffy white towel around her neck and small kit filled with suit polish and scrubs in hand. She pointed around the bend. ""Why is Specialist Traynor power-washing her tongue in the sink?""

Garrus sprinkled salt over his omelette. ""She fell victim to that most despicable of fiends. A breakfast saboteur.""

Tali groaned. ""It wasn't you, was it?"" Garrus waved her off with an irritated scowl. Shepard shrugged and sipped more coffee. Tali shook her head and wandered to the fridge to retrieve her protein shake, dabbing condensation from her mask with her towel.

""Mornin', Sparks,"" Vega said as he passed the other way, carrying a plate stacked with soft boiled eggs and toast. ""Hey,"" he said as he sat next to Cortez. ""So what happened over here?"" He glanced around at the mute response. ""Man, Traynor sure was hot about something. What was that all about, huh? C'mon, what'd I miss? Musta been good.""

Garrus looked at Shepard. ""They always return to the scene of the crime.""

Shepard shook his head. ""Rookie mistake. You hate to see it happen.""

""What are you talking about?"" Vega asked.

""Come on, James. You've been watching from the kitchen this whole time, waiting for Traynor to take your doctored doughnut.""

""Nah, *jefe,* I was just making breakfast!""

""Mmm-hmm. Does it usually take half an hour to prepare three-minute eggs?""

""Case closed,"" Garrus said.

Tali returned to the table, shaking a plastic container full of pinkish-brown liquid. She sat next to Garrus and fished an induction port from her kit. ""So who did it?"" Her veteran shipmates both pointed at Vega across the table. ""Noob,"" Tali scoffed, earning a laugh from Cortez.

Vega crossed his massive arms in front of him. ""I resent this assault on my character.""

""Now there's a victimless crime,"" Cortez said.

""Okay, fine!"" Vega leaned forward, his voice a whisper. ""It was me. But It was funny though, right? You see the look on her face?"" He searched for the smallest hint of a smile or approval from the senior crew and got neither. They simply shook their heads and went back to their meals. ""C'mon, Esteban, you thought it was funny, didn't you? Man, what is wrong with everybody? I'm just trying to liven things up around here!""

""No offense,"" Shepard said. ""But we've seen it all before.""

Tali sighed. ""Gods, have we. Especially the last trip out.""

""What do you mean?"" Vega asked.

""Culinary terrorism,"" Garrus said, gesturing to Traynor's empty seat. ""Medi-jello, varren pâté...""

""Tuchankan snack mix,"" Shepard added. ""All the hits. Of course, Gardner was such a lousy cook, nobody could tell their food had been sabotaged. So we had to branch out. You name it, we did it. Glitter bombs, water over doors, stealing chairs, dye in the shower head.""

""Ugh,"" Tali grunted. ""Half of my job was fixing everyone's attempts to be funny. Duct tape used on everything except ducts. Ticklely haptic controls, greased shuttle seats, capacitive shock door panels. And don't get me started on what counted for hacking on this ship.""

Shepard nodded in remembrance. ""The farting omnitool... Everyone got hit by that one at one point or another.""

""Oh, yeah!"" Vega grinned. ""Now that's a classic!""

Tali rolled her eyes. ""Right. Funny the first time and the hundredth time. I mean, seriously. I'm wearing a hermetically sealed environment suit. How is that even plausible it would come from me?""

Cortez covered his face with his hand as his shoulders heaved with laughter. Vega made no attempt to restrain himself, pounding the table hard enough to rattle the silverware, and even Shepard was laughing now.

Garrus sighed. ""See, that's problem with you kids today. This is what passes for humor. Anybody can fill a salt shaker with sugar and call it a joke. A real prank is clever, subtle. Served with just a pinch of irony.""

Tali gaped at the turian. ""Says the *bosh'tet* who hid rubber rachni all around the ship for me to find!""

""Now, now,"" Garrus said, ""I didn't just pick a random creepy object and get lucky you found it. I did my research. I uncovered your deepest fear, then painstakingly plotted out where leaving them would have the greatest impact.""

""Impact?"" Tali glared at him. ""Like the one that fell on my head when I opened the overhead storage?""

""To be fair, it didn't just fall. It was spring loaded.""

""I nearly had a heart attack!""

Garrus smiled. ""I heard the scream all the way up in the Forward Battery.""

""Yeah, man,"" Vega said. ""Real subtle. How's that different than my doughnut? I mean, I did some legwork, here. Researched Traynor's weaknesses... Creme-filled doughnuts on one end of the spectrum, mayonnaise on the other, and brought them seamlessly together. Then I made all the doughnuts in the same batch so no one could tell which one was doctored. And I knew Traynor would go for the creme. It's a killer recipe by the way, minus the mayo. My Aunt Rosa was an awesome pastry chef.""

Garrus shook his head at the marine. ""But the payoff was so fleeting. All that work for thirty seconds' enjoyment. Our jokes, well, MY jokes anyway, were a little more sophisticated. Satisfying.""

""Yeah? How so?""

""You see,"" Garrus continued. ""The best jokes are ones where the victim doesn't know they've been had. They might suspect something is up, have an inkling that someone is out to get them, but they're never quite sure. And the longer you string them along, the longer you can savor it, and the sweeter the taste when the horrible truth finally comes out. One time, I had my victim climbing the walls for months.""

Vega leaned forward. ""Oh, sounds like it's story time!""

""Indeed. Our last trip out, when the *Normandy* was still under Cerberus management, our newly appointed Chief Engineer kept a healthy supply of disposable, individually wrapped, sterile induction ports on board."" Garrus tapped the table by the one next to Tali's drink.

Tali looked to the ceiling. ""Why are your stories always about me?""

""Now,"" Garrus said, ""these ports came in packs of twenty, with five packs to a box. And if you're the anal-retentive, borderline compulsive type, you keep precise track of them. You might go so far as to log them on spreadsheet.""

""Or,"" Tali countered, ""if you need them to simply eat without sickening yourself, you treat them as life sustaining equipment and keep strict inventory. I don't know why anyone would be compulsive about that!""

Vega cocked his head. ""Okay, I can see where this is going. You swiped her straws?""

Garrus shook his head again. ""See, that's the lack of creativity I was talking about. No, James. I didn't steal them. Finding the odd induction port missing would be an annoyance, and if I took them all at once, it would just be theft, not humor. And there'd certainly be no payoff.""

""So what'd you do then?""

""I researched the brand of port Tali used and ordered a box of my own. And every now and then, I'd add them to her stash.""

Vega popped a whole egg into his mouth. ""What's so funny about that?""

""Tali's an engineer. Numbers are as close to religion as she gets. Now, if the number on her spreadsheet kept going inexplicably down, she'd realize someone was messing with her and the game would be over. But what if that number occasionally went up? That, my friends, is comedy.""

Tali crossed her arms with a sigh.

""It took a few weeks."" Garrus patted the table in front of him. ""But then you'd come in here and find Tali surrounded by open boxes of induction ports, counting them, comparing them to her spreadsheet. If you asked what she was doing, she'd insist that someone, somewhere was sneaking extras into her stock. And woe to any poor crewmate who implied that Tali had miscounted or made a mistake. Her spreadsheet was never, ever wrong. But yet, extra induction ports kept magically appearing at random.""

Garrus smiled at the quarian, who steadfastly avoided eye contact with him. ""By the end of the first of the month, you could tell those extra ones and twos were getting to her. She'd insist to anyone within earshot that someone was messing with her stash. But no one believed her. Because why would anyone possibly be adding them? Surely Tali was just miscounting.

""So she started moving her stash around the ship and slink off in secret when she needed to pick one up. She'd intercept them when they were delivered, so she could number them, inventory them right away and lock them up. She rigged alarms, built traps, even had a live feed for it on her omnitool. But if one was patient enough, careful enough, and skilled enough, there were opportunities to slipstream them in undetected. And so it went for two months. The entire crew thought she was going crazy.""

Tali glared straight ahead, her arms still crossed.

""Then one night,"" Garrus said, ""we were all getting hammered at Flux. After a full night of drinking and dancing, our poor server, who had no idea of the landmine she'd stepped on, asked Tali if she wanted to keep her straw when she came to clear our empties. Tali, who was absolutely smashed by this point, tried to explain they're only supposed to be used once and thrown away, but then burst into tears because 'it just didn't matter anymore!'

""To put it plainly, Tali lost it. She started ranting at the server. The numbers no longer added up, she said. One and one no longer equaled two, she said. The fundamental laws of the universe, she said, had unraveled and all of existence was coming to an end. Our poor server tried to back away, but Tali chased her behind the bar, waving the spreadsheet in front of anyone who would look at it. And when the bartender ordered her out, she accused the entire staff of Flux of being in on it.""

Cortez and Vega both glanced at the quarian, who seemed intent on burning a hole in the opposite wall with her eyes.

""Suffice to say,"" Garrus said, ""when C-Sec responded to the disturbance, we decided to call it a night."" He smiled at Tali. ""You know I survived Ilos, the Battle of the Citadel and the assault on the Collector Base, but that night at Flux-""

""-may be the greatest triumph of your life,"" Tali said, completing the sentence as she tapped on her omnitool. ""Gee, I never get tired of hearing that story.""

Shepard stood and waggled his empty coffee cup. ""Gonna get a refill."" He gave Tali a sympathetic pat on the shoulder as he walked past to the galley, chuckling to himself.

Garrus nodded toward the junior officers across the table. ""That was for their benefit, Tali, not yours. So James, now do you see the difference between a mere prank and a masterpiece?""

Vega nodded. He'd cleaned his entire plate in the time the turian spun his tale. ""Gotta hand it to ya, pretty devious. Tali, you ever get your revenge?""

Garrus answered for her. ""Nothing approaching the grand scope or scale of what I achieved. She knows better than to try.""

""You're amaaazing,"" Tali said, sarcastically drawing out the middle syllable. ""No one will ever be able to top Garrus Vakarian.""

""Sad, but true."" The turian's omnitool pinged, and Garrus stood. ""There's always been a sore lack of true competition on this ship. Well, I'd love to sit here and further savor the humiliation of my shipmates, but the fire control system is in need of attention."" He looked at Shepard as he returned to the table with his coffee. ""We're docked for the day, right?""

Shepard nodded and sat back down. ""Yeah, 'til 0500 tomorrow, why?""

""Need to take down fire control for a bit, do some debugging.""

Tali shook her head. ""Maybe if you weren't so busy messing with other peoples' property, the ship might actually stay in working condition.""

""Talk to Cerberus and the Alliance,"" Garrus said as he walked by. ""If they built it right to begin with, I wouldn't have to keep fixing it.""

Shepard took a sip of fresh coffee. ""Just make sure we're back online before we set sail. Keep me posted.""

""Will do."" Garrus walked around the table but stopped behind Vega and Cortez. He rested his hands on their shoulders. ""Oh, and gentlemen, if at any time during this conversation you had thoughts of tangling with me, on behalf of Tali, or maybe just because you'd like a shot at the title, remember turians invented the concept of overwhelming retaliation. So... do either of you care to dance?""

""No sir,"" Cortez said. ""I don't even want to hear the music.""

Vega held up his hands. ""Message received. Don't fuck with Vakarian.""

Garrus patted their shoulders with satisfaction. ""And that, my friends, is how we keep the peace. Now, if you'll excuse me, calibrations await.""

Shepard raised his cup to Garrus in salute.

Cortez watched the turian walk up the stairs to the Forward Battery. ""He was definitely talking to you, Vega.""

""No way, Jose!"" Vega turned back to the table. ""I may be a crayon-eater, but I ain't stupid. I'll stick to messing with Traynor.""

As soon as the hatch sealed behind Garrus, Shepard let out a loud snort. He then erupted into full-blown laughter, holding onto the table to keep from falling from his chair. Tali calmly picked up her protein drink and gave it a shake to mix its settled contents.

""What's so funny?"" Cortez asked.

""Yeah,"" Vega said, watching his commander's face turn red. ""What'd we miss?""

Shepard thumped the table next to Tali. ""You did it right in front of him! I had to get up or I would have lost it right there!""

Tali kept shaking her drink. ""I mean, if he hasn't figured it out by now...""

""Figured what out?"" Vega asked. ""What's going on here?""

""You heard the master,"" Tali said. ""The best jokes are the ones where the victim doesn't know he's been had. You get to savor their suffering.""

""And the longer it goes,"" Shepard said between laughs, ""the better it is when they finally find out!""

""I still don't get it,"" Vega said, looking between Tali and Shepard in confusion.

Tali unwrapped her sterilized induction port. ""There's nothing wrong with the fire control system. He had it fixed his first month on the ship. His omnitool, on the other hand...""

Dawning realization crept across Cortez's face. ""You mean all that time he spends in there calibrating, it's because you're...?""

Tali held up her omnitool and batted her glowing eyes. ""I wrote an app for it.""

Shepard reached out for Tali's shoulder and finally caught his breath. ""You know, Garrus put in to go on shore leave tonight...""

Tali glanced at her wrist. ""Oh, he should have it fixed by then."" She tapped a few keys. ""Maybe.""

""Holy shit,"" Vega whispered. ""How long have you been doing this to him?""

Shepard couldn't stop laughing.""Let's see, when did you join us on the SR-2, Tali?""

""Over a year ago,"" Tali said. ""And I'll keep it going until Mister Overwhelming Retaliation figures it out.""

""At this rate,"" Shepard said, ""that'll be when we're aboard the *Normandy* SR-3!""

It was Tali's turn to laugh. But her smile faded and she stared meaningfully at Vega and Cortez. ""Needless to say, don't tell him. Because if you do, you're next.""

Cortez gulped under Tali's withering gaze. ""Mum's the word, ma'am.""

""New message received,"" Vega said. ""Don't fuck with Zorah.""

Tali winked at them. She picked up her shake and twirled the induction port between her fingers like a miniature baton before snapping it into the top of the bottle. Shepard raised his mug and she tapped her drink against his. Tali leaned back in her seat took a long slurp of the blended protein mix through the fresh induction port.

True to Garrus's words, it tasted sweeter every day.

That made me thinking: did the pandemic influence my (s*x**l) behaviour? And, I think the answer is yes. During COVID, I was working from home every day and it was so easy to fap multiple times per day, to watch p**n, etc. Normally, when I didn't have much to do, I gathered with colleagues around the coffee machine, we drunk some coffee and had some good laughs. During COVID, these colleagues and these conversations were mainly replaced by online women.

I'm looking to get myself a moka pot for my dorm room. The main problem is that I only have induction.         

For minor health and hygiene concerns, I would prefer an all-steel model, like the Bialetti Venus. After spending way too much time reading up on alu vs steel, I concluded that steel is less of a hassle to handle, less room to screw up with the cleaning and care, and even if nothing else matters, the round design of the Venus must be easier to clean, right?      

The secondary problem is that I live alone, and would make coffee in this maybe 2 times a week, so I definitely want to go for a 2 cup size, not bigger. As you may know, the Venus has a much smaller base than the Moka Induction. In fact, Bialetti explicitly says that the 2 cup Venus is not suitable for induction. Sad.         

However, I know for a fact that the 2 cup Moka Induction with a heavier and wider bottom does work, because a neighbor has one and I tested it.        

Wild idea: can I get a Venus, plus used Moka Induction for cheap and use the Moka Induction bottom with the Venus top of the corresponding size? I did not find the specification of the threads online. Would it fit? Beyond that, would it seal well? Would it screw up the resulting coffee?          

I know this is a weird idea, and I may not do it even if I could, but I want to know. Also, any comments in the topic are welcome by this newbie who already spent way too much time on this in the past few days. ",2,1743600454.0,mokapot,2,1.0,False

I've been having an on-and-off battle with a QTJ1 that I got. Failed to get it to work in an OEM Dell Optiplex motherboard (BIOS limitations), but recently got an Asus Z170E board and was able to get inconsistent booting with my modded BIOS (after more trial and error). I've added and removed components individually, and the main issue seems to be the CPU cooler mounting and having an even pressure on the IHS to get the board to boot (also minor RAM issues at times and kernel errors, but likely linked to the overall CPU mounting issue).

How have all of you mounted your CPU coolers on these mutant chips? The CPU+IHS version is taller than standard CPUs, and while the seller did include plastic washers to raise the slot latch, it wasn't enough to latch without crushing the socket. I ended up just foregoing the latch and mounting my cooler directly on the chip, using the washer method to screw down the four corners and hope for the best (worked okay in my Mac Pro 4,1 way back when). However, any time I move the computer, all my effort vanishes and it fails to boot, so I need a better method to avoid constant fiddling with the screws. Any suggestions?

I jumped up to assess the situation and yes there is poop EVERYWHERE (She had been clogged up and medicated with senna and mirlax to help her move it out. It helped too well) 
Not only is there poop in every crease, crevice, and crack, but it has run down to the feet. 

I can see the tracks of toddler poop feet scattered across the room. 🤦🏻‍♀️ This is going to be a day. 

Pant’s ruined, and an hour of showering, scrubbing, and de-pooping and not a sip of coffee to boot.

1jpoino,https://www.reddit.com/r/pruritusani/comments/1jpoino/butt_crack_itch/,Butt crack itch,"I’ve been reading through this community for a while and have gotten lots of great info and seen a lot of similarities with my own issue. 

A little background first, 38M, I’ve been dealing with itchy anus for years. I remember it started with a hemorrhoid or two, then what I think were fissures. It’s mostly been manageable and not as bad as some people seem to get. It got bad or I created a worse problem because it would feel really good to itch, or not even really itch but push pressure on my anus or the area right next to it. I would feel an itch and not necessarily scratch but I would rub with pressure. Sounds weird but it would feel really good. I realized it was causing more itch later on but couldn’t help myself. As time went on I was able to self restrain, I also got a bidet at home and use flushable wipes at work and hotels. These things have made it much more manageable. 

I notice I get fissures when I have hard or large/hard stools. It’s pretty much guaranteed and I know right away when it’s going to happen. When I happens there will be a little bit of blood, but not dripping or anything. I wouldn’t say the pain near as bad as some people describe it. And as long as I clean well, once I’m done it won’t bother me the rest of the day, won’t continue to bleed and won’t bleed the next day unless it’s hard again. 

I’ve never gone to a doctor, partly because it’s really embarrassing but mostly because I’ve read SO much on here about people never getting help from doctors or surgeons just wanting to do surgery, which also doesn’t help. 

I’ve used hemorrhoid creams, diaper rash creams, pranicura, Vaseline, etc. I tried miralax, don’t recommend as it just felt like I lost muscle control. I tried OTC yeast infection meds. I have stayed away from hydrocortisone because of the fears of thinning the skin. It’s been manageable because I know what I need and know to just keep the area clean. Most days I can go all day without issues. Sometimes I need to clean once or twice a day, add pranicura to numb/protect but it’s definitely not a huge deal for me. 

A couple months ago I started to really get itchy up towards the top of my butt crack. I use my forward facing phone camera to get a look and I see a line that comes up my crack like a crease, it’s basically like my crack was pulled apart and the skin opened up. When it’s really irritated I can dab it with toilet paper and see a little blood. It seems like this itch is completely random. I’ll exclusively use the bidet for days straight, so there is zero wiping of that area. It’s just like something triggers that irritation to open up. I have to use pranicura on that area occasionally and it does help take the itch away. I also occasionally get irritation going the other direction in my taint area, but that’s usually not as bad. 

So to sum it up, I would describe my issue as the skin of my anus region is tissue paper thin and doesn’t heal very well. I’ve read about food/allergy triggers. I tried removing caffeine for a couple weeks with no effect, but have been thinking about trying again. This is really hard because I love my coffee in the mornings and it keeps my bowel movements regular. I also have theories about maybe chocolate or cheese, but haven’t experimented with ruling them out. 

I’ve also thought about finally seeing a doctor and since this latest issue seems like a skin issue vs gastro, I’ve thought about going to a dermatologist. I’ve also thought maybe I should do an allergy panel first.

Whenever I have to talk to senior management (CEOs, Managing Directors, or even just someone who looks like they have “decision-making powers”my brain decides to betray me. My voice changes, my words stumble over themselves, and my body language screams, “I don’t belong here.” It’s like I suddenly forget how to be a normal, functioning professional.

I know I’m capable, and I do my job well. But the moment I’m in a high-stakes conversation, I feel like an intern who accidentally wandered into the boardroom. Meanwhile, I see colleagues who just walk in, own the room, and command respect without even trying.

How do I stop looking nervous and underconfident when talking to the senior management? Any tips on improving body language, voice control, or just faking confidence until I actually feel it?

She was helping her a lot with daily life struggles at first, it turned out she’s alcoholic and god knows what else, I think she also has some mental issues to that. But over time mom started being more and more involved in this woman’s life to the point when over a year ago she stopped living and sleeping in her own house, she’s just with that woman all the damn time! My dad is a shy guy who doesn’t like to get into fights and arguments, when he nicely asked why she’s not even coming home and acting like she found a new family she told him that this woman needs help and we (her kids) are adults now so we’re fine, she will help her and then eventually everything will get back to normal, she said that 2 years ago lol. He’s not really pushing her anymore because there’s no sense when she’s not even realizing how inappropriate is that, she thinks she’s doing good stuff helping people out and god is praising her. What’s funny she’s really catholic and she doesn’t see that leaving husband and kids alone for over a year isn’t really compatible with her religion. This woman has a mother and friends to help her, yet my mom is the one basically living with her? What frustrates me the most is my mom playing stupid to the whole family that she’s coming home after work everyday, lives normal life and nothing is wrong! Only my grandma (her mom) knows something about that and when she’s asking her she’s just shrugging it off and tells it’s not a big deal and everything is just fine because that woman needs just a little help and she’s able to manage her and family and work. But it’s not working like she thinks it is, when someone is alcoholic and mentally unstable, and is just watched by a friend all the time to not get alcohol the problem is not going away, she needs therapy and professional medical help, but they as Catholics think if they will pray for help to god then all the struggles will magically disappear and psychologists is not needed, it’s just for mental people… Makes me sad that I’m living abroad 1500km away from my family and when I’m coming to visit 2-3 times a year she doesn’t even have time to meet me, she’s coming home for like 2 hours and plays like she has some important things to do and she leaves, not coming back.

Stonfiers! The future we've been building is now live. After months of development and internal testing, Omniston protocol has been publicly available for a month now as part of our open testing phase to ensure your safety and optimal performance.



**❓What is Omniston?**

Omniston is our liquidity aggregation protocol that brings together the entire TON DeFi ecosystem, offering practical benefits that transform how you trade:

💎 Access to all TON liquidity in one place — trade any TON token directly through STONfi interface

💎 Best possible swap rates — resolvers compete to find optimal routes across all TON DEX pools, not just STONfi's

💎 Enhanced efficiency through RFQ (Request for Quote) mechanics



Omniston already aggregates liquidity from the largest TON-based DeFi protocols to deliver the best swap rates with three resolvers currently connected: STON.fi, swap.coffee, and moki — with more joining soon.



**❓What are resolvers?**

These are the entities that reply to a user's request with a quote and execute trades, sourcing liquidity from various DEXs across the TON ecosystem.



Omniston represents a significant step toward our future cross-chain functionality, which will connect TON's liquidity with other blockchain ecosystems.



**❓How do I use Omniston?**

The protocol is already enabled in the [STON.fi](http://STON.fi) UI — just make sure it's toggled on in the settings on the Swap page. Note that during this beta phase, transaction size is currently limited to $1000.



**🔗** [**Use Omniston**](https://app.ston.fi/swap) 🔗 

Be sure to enable Omniston on the Swap settings page!



At [STON.fi](http://STON.fi), we believe the future of finance is built together. With Omniston, we're not just solving today's DeFi challenges — we're creating the infrastructure for TON's global adoption.



Stay tuned!

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

## Design and comfort: A Matter of Personal Preference

Conversely, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 presents a more modern, almost industrial design. They don't fold in quite the same compact way as the Sonys,instead rotating flat. The Momentum 4 also prioritizes comfort, featuring generously padded earcups and a headband. However, some users might find the Momentum 4 slightly bulkier than the XM5. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 comfort is generally rated very high, but personal preference plays a critical role here.Ultimately, the ""better"" design is subjective and depends on your styling preferences and how you intend to transport them.

## Noise Cancellation: Silence is Golden

Noise cancellation is a crucial feature for frequent travelers,commuters,and anyone seeking peace and quiet in noisy environments. In this department, both the Sennheiser Momentum 4 noise cancelling and sony wh 1000xm5 noise cancelling capabilities are top-notch, but there are subtle differences.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 employs sony's industry-leading noise cancellation technology, utilizing multiple microphones and refined algorithms to effectively block out a wide range of ambient noises. From the rumble of an airplane engine to the chatter of a busy coffee shop, the XM5 excels at creating a tranquil listening environment. The sony wh 1000xm5 noise cancelling technology has been praised for its effectiveness across various frequencies.

The sennheiser Momentum 4 noise cancelling presents a formidable challenge in its own right. While some tests indicate it might not quite reach the absolute pinnacle of noise cancellation achieved by the XM5, the Momentum 4 offers remarkable noise reduction capabilities. It adapts the noise cancellation to your environment via an adaptive mode to maximize performance. For many everyday situations, the difference in noise cancellation performance between the two headphones will be negligible.

## Battery Life: Powering Your Day

Battery life is a significant consideration for wireless headphones, notably for users who spend long hours listening to music or podcasts.

The Sennheiser Momentum 4 battery life shines is in its impressive endurance.Sennheiser claims up to 60 hours of playback on a single charge, surpassing the Sony WH-1000XM5's stated battery life. In real-world testing, the Momentum 4 generally lives up to this claim, making it an excellent choice for travelers and users who frequently forget to charge their headphones.

The Sony WH-1000XM5 battery life is still respectable,offering up to 30 hours of playback with noise cancellation enabled. While this is less than the Momentum 4, it's more than sufficient for most users. Additionally, the XM5 supports speedy charging, providing several hours of playback with just a short charging session.

Thus, if battery life is a top priority, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 emerges as the clear winner. Though, the Sony WH-1000XM5's battery life is still adequate for most users, especially with its quick-charging capabilities.

1jpo9ko,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1jpo9ko/pain_and_dizziness_from_working_standing_up/,Pain and dizziness from working standing up.,"I (25f, 45/50kg) recently started a new job where I have to stand for anywhere from 6 to 9 hours a day. I come from a long period of depression, I haven't had a real job in about a year and the previous jobs were temporary.

This past year was quite bad with depression, some days I didn't get out of bed. Now I'm doing better and I felt ready to start working again, but I feel like when I pass the 5/6h mark I start having quite a bit of pain on my feet, legs, hips and lower back. The worst is feeling a bit dizzy, I always drink a lot of water, and some sugary drinks like a Gatorade or similar, but still, the dizziness doesn't stop.

I also noticed a bit of a high bpm, around 100/110 after a while. I don't know if it's anxiety, I feel like it isn't because I don't really feel anxious but the fast heartbeat makes me anxious, so I guess it could be a cicle.

For the muscle pains I'm already looking into compression socks, good shoes and maybe something for the back, but I don't really know what to do about the dizziness.

I take a prescribed antidepressant at night, and some pills for hypothyroidism, but I think that's going well as of now. I don't drink coffee, sodas or things with caffeine, I do smoke tho, but just about 5 cigs a day (trying to quit). Used to go to the gym 6 months ago, but kinda stopped because of the depression. Overall I'm quite healthy as far as my blood analytics go.

So, long story short, muscle pains and such don't really bother me that much, but that dizziness does make me anxious and I don't know where it's from or what should I take to feel a bit better.",1,1743599668.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1jpo7y2,https://akings73.wordpress.com/2025/04/02/the-weight-of-silence-echoes-of-a-broken-heart/,"The Weight of Silence, Echoes of a Broken Heart","July 2012. I flew back to California with a broken heart, not like a girlfriend bad breakup kind, nor the one that stings when life simply doesn’t go your way. No, this was something deeper, something that reached into my very core and shattered everything I thought I knew about love, trust, and the life I had built. This was the kind of heartbreak that reaches down into the depths of your very soul and takes out whatever was left of your dignity.

Life, as I had known it, was no more. From this moment on, I was on an unfamiliar road—not one that I chose, but one I had no choice but to take. The only question was: how would I walk it? Would I summon what courage I have left and stride forward with the purpose of finding my destiny? Or would I be left on my knees; weighed down by heartbreak, drained in mind, body, and soul?

I arrived in San Francisco feeling like an empty shadow of the man I once was, completely devoid of enthusiasm for anything. The sights, the sounds, the iconic bridges and the historic hills and bays, it all passed by in a blur, drowned out by the relentless, nagging voice in my head asking, “What if” or “Is life even worth it”? My soul was screaming for what I’d lost, and my brain was doing its best to drown itself in self-pity.

At the airport, my Aunt was waiting. My parents halfway around the world away, she was all I had. I hadn’t seen her in years, maybe even a decade. She greeted me with a quiet smile before pulling me into a hug. And that’s when the floodgates of emotions opened—tears spilling onto her shoulder. It was the first time in hours, maybe even days, that I felt something other than despair. Because in that moment, I realized I wasn’t completely alone in the wreckage of my life.

Before heading to her house, we dropped by my cousin’s place—a lovely Californian home. I’ve always been fascinated with houses. In the way they’re built and in how they’re designed. Their age and character, and normally, I’d be admiring the interior by then. But not this time. This time, I was looking for something else; familiarity, or a sense that I still belonged somewhere.

That feeling didn’t last long.

For reasons I had suspicions about, they weren’t quite sure what to make of me. I don’t blame them. All the lies they had been told—malicious, insidious lies—seemed, at the time, entirely plausible. Maybe even unquestionable. Lies that time and circumstance have since proven wrong. But it didn’t matter. The damage was done. The evil that people do had already destroyed my home.

So when my cousin and his wife saw me, they exchanged uneasy glances before saying, in the warmest possible tone: “We didn’t want any part of your problem, but here you are bringing it into our doorstep.”

Family.

That sentence alone was enough to finish off whatever fragile grip I still had on my old life. But my Aunt? She wasn’t having any of it. With the kind of unwavering loyalty you only see in the worst situation, she reminded me exactly who I was. Who I came from. Whose grandson I was. And so, I bit my tongue, swallowed the anger, and held onto whatever shred of sanity I had left.

At my Aunt’s house, I met her husband—a man who, unlike most people at the time, actually showed me kindness. The food he cooked for me would make the old South proud, he counseled me, and most importantly, he gave me a piece of advice that, even now, I think about often. “Anger,” he said, “is like a ball. You throw it at someone, and it bounces right back. The trick is to not throw it at all. Or, if you must, throw it so far away it never comes back.”

Profound stuff.

And so began my slow recovery. My Aunt had me up at the crack of dawn for long walks. We’d start the day at a coffee shop, stroll through Salinas Park, and feed stray cats and foxes because, apparently, that’s just what we did now. And then there was the politics. It was 2012, and the country was deep in the throes of Obama vs. Romney. My Aunt, being the type of person who doesn’t shy away from a good debate, gave an impassioned speech to a room full of coffee shop patrons about the importance of voting. Only for the owner, in the most deadpan delivery possible, to inform her afterward that every single person in that shop was an undocumented immigrant.
“Well,” she shrugged, “maybe they can use that knowledge when they get legal.”

Legend.

Days turned into weeks. I kept myself busy with chores—fixing fences, tending the yard, tutoring math to kids at the local library, anything that kept me moving and my mind from imploding. Slowly, grudgingly, I got a little better. Good enough. Then, on a whim, I drove more than seven hours to Southern California to see my childhood friends. And there, I was welcomed with open arms. No judgment, no awkward glances. Just love and acceptance. They had no idea, but inside, I was crying tears of joy. Because in that moment, I realized something crucial—that I would love them forever.

Back in Salinas, I dealt with what I now recognize as deep depression. Every day, I drove to the beach using an old Dodge pickup truck, a truck that had so much rust and character it could have been on National Geographic. On one particular bright, sunny day, as I sat in the parking lot overlooking the ocean, a Japanese tourist holding a camera with huge long lens, knocked on my window. I rolled it down just enough to hear him.
“Excuse me,” he said, pointing to his camera, “where can I find a white surfer girl?”

I blinked. Surely, I had misheard him. But no, he repeated it. Louder. Slower. “White. Surfer. Girl.”

I thought, now what was I supposed to do with that information? Give him a map? Offer him a brochure? Instead, I just muttered, “Dude… you might wanna try the beach,” and rolled my window back up.
People are weird.

Months passed. Eventually, my sister, returned from her mournful trip, one of my guardian angels and invited me to live with her and her family in Indiana. And so, I packed up, got on an airplane, and began the next chapter of my life.

Lastly, there’s something I need to say.
To my Aunt, my generous, loving Aunt, my mother’s last remaining sister from her childhood—we may not have spent long stretches of time together, but when it truly mattered, you were there, you saved my life and I love you profoundly. And to her husband, whose wisdom still guides me to this day—I don’t know what I would have done without you, thank you and I love you like a father.

To my beloved cousins in North Carolina and California—without you, I can’t begin to imagine where I would have ended up. To my cousin in North Carolina, I miss you every day. I still cherish those impromptu dinners in Charlotte whenever I’m in town, the kind that never needed planning, just good company, lots and lots of laughter and shared moments.

To my sister, my Indiana sister, whose love has always been a part of my life, my sister as I have always known. She who was ever so patient with me, I miss our conversations on our drive to work every day. I felt really happy in the car with you, with Christmas songs playing in the background. And to her husband, who inspires me to this day—I will love you both forever.

To all my Californian friends, lord knows I cannot express just how much I love all of you. Part of my heart is with our friend right now. She will be back. And when she does, let’s do one of those sleepovers again. I love you with all of me.

-----------------------------
And if I may: Depression is real. It’s not a disease that manifest physically, not something you can catch, and certainly not something to be ashamed of. It’s a deeply personal struggle, marked by deep sorrow and hardship. Right now, over 21 million Americans are battling it. But here’s the good news—you don’t have to face it alone. Whether it’s your loved ones, a counselor, or a psychologist, help is there if you reach for it. The first step is the hardest, but it starts with asking for help.

At first, we were just hooking up, I caught feelings but he wasn’t looking for anything serious, so we stayed friends.

2 years ago, I moved to another city for my studies (one year exchange), and started a relationship with someone new. It lasted almost a year. Marcus even visited me during this time and the three of us hung out together. I realized that I still had feelings for Marcus, so when my studies ended, I broke up with my boyfriend and soon got together with Marcus. He was now living abroad for his PhD, but our relationship was and is serious, despite the distance.

So, we’ve been together for almost a year now. But we had a major problem. He had been hooking up a lot in the past, including with a woman called Anna. He slept with Anna twice soon before we got together. He then went abroad and they kind of kept in touch, but he didn’t wanna tell her he is in a relationship because “Anna had feelings for him and she would be hurt.”

So apparently they were planning to video call and then I told him to tell her. He did, they video called, and he claimed SHE UNDERSTOOD the boundaries.

Well, in the following months I guess they still kept in touch because they wanted to meet for coffee. I said no and we had a big fight. I asked to see the texts and got very mad when I saw a photo of Anna being bent over (she was posing with a cat). They had one last “closure” call (puking) and he then told me her and I should talk so that I understand that Anna is not a threat.

So I called Anna via Zoom. It took a long time because she kept saying she was at work (apparently Marcus LOVED her ambition and she was showing off or what). She kept denying she wanted Marcus, saying “Why would you think I wanna woo him with such a photo if he already saw me naked” (wow). I asked her to send me the whole chat history with Marcus and then blocked her everywhere.

The texts just crushed me. He would tell she imagined her bending over, said no one s..cked d..ck like she did, and when he told her he has a gf Anna told him what he did was not ok, yet later she still sent that photo with the cat and wanted to meet with him.

It's been a lifelong dream of mine to see Hole in the Wall & the Wild Coast, and it seems like this year I have finally been able to rally a bunch of friends (all early/ mid 20s male and female - about 8 - 10 people) to celebrate the end of an era and do a proper roadtrip.

However, safety is a concern and I'm a bit nervous after reading the news. Also, we do not know the Eastern Cape at all, and those of us who have been, were there over a decade ago now.

  
Therefore, please critique our plans! Currently aiming to go late November/ early December, and as students our biggest considerations are safety & cost. We also ideally don't want to drive more than 6 hours per day.

Night 1:  Leave Cape Town & drive to Beaufort-West where we overnight on a farm. 

Night 2 & 3: Drive from BW to Hoggsback and sleep here at Serendipity Self-Catering.

Night 4- 8: Drive from Hogsback to The Coffee Shack Backpackers .

Now, this part of the trip makes me the most nervous - we have cars that can handle some potholes, but someone told me to rather go to Hole in the Wall directly? Advice appreciated - we also would be traveling in more than one car and avoiding Mthatha, but alas. 

  
Night 9: Port Alfred on a private game lodge just outside the town

  
Night 10 - 12: Drive through PE to George, to family. We are familiar with the Garden Route so no advice necessary here

[Roads we are thinking of taking in the EC](https://preview.redd.it/p1vu1vpo6fse1.png?width=832&format=png&auto=webp&s=02aac3c709486c8406d7b10455744d01b8ddb58e)

1jpo3gg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Westchester/comments/1jpo3gg/new_rochelle_has_been_great_to_me/,New Rochelle has been great to me,"I’ve seen many posts here discussing how unsafe or crappy New Rochelle is.

Let me give some background on me; I’m a late 20s male. I grew up in a small town in a small state and lived elsewhere in Westchester prior to moving to New Rochelle. I’ve also lived in Manhattan. I have lived in NR for coming up on 3 years now. 

Safety; You can look up the crime statistics which I feel support me here, crime in New Rochelle is very low. I’ve never felt even remotely unsafe in New Rochelle. In white plains I have, while being in the Bronx and Yonkers I have, and I have also in Manhattan. However the crime data for White Plains is also great fwiw. My wife and I never feel unsafe walking alone at night. There’s enough people on the well lit streets and many people including  families walking around.  

Walkability; I have a car but live downtown in New Rochelle. I can walk to anything I need ever. Need to see my dentist? I walk 8 min. Need to see an eye doctor? Walk 3 min. Grocery store? Usually walk 3 min, but can drive 5 min to a bigger grocery store. Movies? 6 min walk. Restaurants or coffee? A plethora of options in <5 min walk. Metro north or Amtrak? <5 min walk. From there can go as far south as DC or as high north as Boston (with 1 train on the Amtrak) or as far north as New Haven and as far south as grand central with the metro north taking one train. 

Food: The food is fantastic. Not quite NYC level obviously but very strong in its own right. Really nice date restaurants like Dubrovnik and Maria’s and also great quick pick up food like Space grill and AJ’s burgers. Pizza and Hispanic food are stellar. 

Rent: This is actually pretty high in the high rises, but NYC/White Plains level in terms of price. My apartment has a gym, pool, pool tables, ping pong, lounge etc. 

Diversity: New Rochelle is very diverse. If you often feel like the odd one sticking out because of your skin color/ethnicity New Rochelle has people like you, including my own ethnic group. ",32,1743599170.0,Westchester,19,0.98,False

Well, that was me not too long ago. I felt like I was on a productivity treadmill — moving fast but getting nowhere. Then I stumbled upon a combination of *time blocking* and assessing my *energy peaks*. Game. Changer.

**Here's what I did (and why it might just save you 10 hours a week too):**

**1. Discover Your Energy Peaks** 🌟  
First off, ask yourself: Are you a morning lark or a night owl? Or maybe you're a weird in-betweener like me. For a week, I paid attention to when I felt like a rock star and when I felt like a... well, a potato. These are your energy peaks and troughs!

**2. Time Blocking Like a Boss** 📅  
Once you know when you're at your best, start time-blocking. It's like budgeting your time but in a less boring way. Basically, you carve out chunks of time for specific tasks, but the magic sauce is aligning these blocks with your energy peaks.  
- **Morning person?** Crush those complex tasks during the golden hours.  
- **Afternoon slump?** Save it for emails or laundry (yep, even those chores need love).  
- **Evening energizer?** Plan your creative projects for when your brain decides to throw a party.

**3. Eliminate the Fluff** 🧹  
Ask yourself: Do I need to do this *now*? Focus on stuff that really matters and is worth doing during your peak times. You'd be surprised at how much “fluff” can wait or even disappear!

**4. Stay Adaptable, Not Rigid** 🌈  
Time blocking and energy peaks aren’t hard rules — life happens. Kids get sick, meetings run over, Netflix launches a new series… you get the idea. It's okay to tweak as you go. Flexibility was a game-changer for me.

**5. Celebrate the Gains** 🎉  
With all the time you’ll save, find ways to reward yourself. Half an hour of gaming, a cup of that fancy coffee you love, or maybe just a good old-fashioned nap. You’ve earned it!

So, have you tried time blocking or mapping out your energy peaks? Or do you have a completely different approach that works wonders for you? Let’s chat about it! Remember, we're not looking for a one-size-fits-all — just some hacks to make every day feel a little more kickass. 😊",1,1743599121.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

Nothing groundbreaking, more narcissism, proof that Cate is just as bad as Tyler and lots of Teresa bashing. Apologies for the length! 🤡🤡","Before diving in, the most important part of the podcast I want to talk about has to be mentioned up top so more people see it. I am disgusted. They hit a new low. 

• Cate and Tyler accuse B&T of exploiting Carly themselves and refer to them only allowing a photo of Carly with her back to the camera walking with the other girls to be used on the show if they were compensated for it. They say this as if it’s a bombshell and Jordy eats it up, licking up all the details from Tyler’s ass like it’s nectar from the heavens. 

This is NOT evil like they are l desperately making it out to be. They went on to say that they used that money to pay for travel, flights and accommodation for the visit. 

How is this exploitation? Answer = it’s not. 

They were compensated for a photo that shows nothing of Carly in order to fund their trip to see these people in the first place. 

Do not believe the headlines that will most likely be sensationalised to get clicks. 

Ok, now in order of topics: 

Tyler and Cate have asked Jordy Cray to be on their show because apparently he has opposing views, which Tyler mentions more than a dozen times, he welcomes and WANTS to hear. 

Unfortunately for us, Jordy drank the Kool-Aid within minutes. I’m not sure if it was Tyler’s overwhelming manipulation or Cates faux wounded bird routine, but he failed us. 


• Jordy says he believes that making this situation so public with their huge platform has blown it up. Asks them if what they’re doing constitutes using their platform to get back at people and manipulate for sympathy. 

Tyler stumbled on his words for a while until Cate stepped in, offering nothing, Tyler composes himself and asks why Jordy thinks that. 

Jordy says because of their public voice it can be seen as recruiting people to be on their side. 

Cate says their main goal for putting it out publicly is for Carly to see that they never stopped trying. It is also bringing awareness to everyone involved in adoption that stuff like this happens and gives a voice to adoptees. 

*yes, it is showing adoptive parents and adoptees that bio parents can go batshit crazy and attempt to annihilate your happiness and personal safety for their own selfish gain and ego* 

Tyler, unusual Tyler fashion, switches it around to deflect any criticism “do you believe other people on the cast recruit for sympathy?” 

This went nowhere. Let’s move on. 

• Jordy says that when he spoke to Tyler through Instagram about this situation Tyler said he “doesn’t care” of any negative impact on B&T or any backlash. Points out Carly will see all this like they want, but that includes the negative, too. 

Tyler, in true Temu Batman fashion, brings out his weak powers of deflection and dodges this accusation by saying “well you do that on your page, too” 

*Jordy isn’t an exploitative lazy piece of shit with three kids at home terrorising a family that wants privacy* 

• Jordy asks if it will drive Carly away even more. Cate says they don’t know because no one talks to them and they were told not to even send updates or gifts to the house anymore. This direction came through Dawn after they were blocked. 

Cate says she wants to give backstory. Apparently Cate and Grahams mother are close. 

It all started with Grahams mum reaching out asking Cate if there will be a visit that year, Cate made a group chat with her and Teresa asking for a visit. Teresa ghosts for weeks (Cate says she always does that). 

Grahams mum messages Cate to follow up. 

Cate follows up with Teresa. 

Teresa says “I know it’s disappointing but not this year sorry”. Cate responds angrily with “Yeah it’s disappointing for all the kids because they all know Carly is their sister and Grahams mom’s kids know he is their brother.” 

Teresa says “Yes, we know and we’re sorry we love and care about you guys so much.” 

They pushed again, we can come to you. 

Teresa finally got upset and did not respond because Cate said “it doesn’t feel like love because I spend time with people that I love and care about.” 

*Catelynn and Tyler think that this method of direct contact to manipulate and project is completely appropriate. The tone is very “TERESA IS THE PROBLEM”*

• Fast forward to Carly’s birthday. They sent gifts and followed up through text to see if Carly liked them. They did not get a response. 

*Tyler cuts in, as he does, sounding like a busted car alarm with his high pitched squeal. Excited that he’s getting attention from someone that isn’t Cate.*

“WE JUST WANT TO KNOW DOES SHE LIKE OUR GIFTS” 

*Guys, if you need anything in return for a gift, even validation, you aren’t gifting right*

Teresa responded eventually to tell them that they need some space because they are hurt by things that Cate and Tyler have been saying publicly. 

Cate lies through her teeth and says she has never said anything bad and we can go back and look at what she said over the years on the show. 

Cate responds to Teresa that her feelings are hurt too. We should have a conversation. Until then I’ll continue sending gifts to Carly and I’ll continue to send updates by text. 

Cate says the only reason she text her so much and so frequently is because it was after Teresa told her no visit and said she needed a break from them. 

*Not rational at all, but when you don’t leave the house, have no prospects, wallow in your self imposed suffering and harass a teen girl, how rational can you really be?*

Cate says she decided to constantly text because she had a lot of adoptees and birth parents messaging her saying they should never stop because one day she will see it. 

*NO ADOPTEE HAS THE SAME STORY. They should never take advice from strangers who are not in the same position as them, or a mental health professional* 

Then Teresa blocked. FUCK YEAH, GIRLFRIEND. We Stan 👏👏👏

• Cate says she continued sending gifts anyway such as crumbl cookies for Carly’s birthdays because “every teen loves crumbl cookies”

*You don’t know her. For the millionth time. You know nothing about her.*

AD BREAK - Cate trying to sell clothes, because we all admire her 2006 Michigan Walmart mom style and now we have a way to attain that same flair!! 

Teresa told Dawn they can’t send gifts to their house anymore because it’s inappropriate. They can’t understand. “How are you withholding expressions of love. Anyone can give my kid a gift” 

*Thanks Tyler. So wisdomous (Joey Tribiani reference, I know that’s not a word).*

“Carly has been receiving gifts for 15 years and how do you explain to her they’ve stopped now. 

Cate sat there as a child and told Teresa and Brandon that she wanted to be able to send gifts for every holiday. They agreed with that.” 

*They both have no understanding of CONSENT. It can be withdrawn at ANY time for ANY reason.* 

• Tyler says, again, it’s not exploitation like people are saying. We are trying to get our voice across. 

YOU GUYS ARE ON A STUPID REALITY SHOW AND HAVE BEEN FOR 16 YEARS. ALL WE HAVE HEARD IS YOUR VOICE. 


• Tyler says they asked Dawn if it’s Carly telling them she doesn’t want gifts and updates. 

“If you’re advocating for your kid you should tell us why. You’re not advocating for her. They have an answer and we’re not gonna get it.”

He says the power dynamic is weird and he doesn’t get it. 

*Tyler can’t understand a power dynamic where someone says the word NO to him or, simply refuses to engage.*

“You agreed on all these things you agreed to it being filmed. You agreed to reunions.” 

*No, they didn’t agree to ALL OF THIS.*

Tyler brings up the magazine spread AGAIN, basically saying YOU POST HER WHY CANT WE - the answer, Tyler, is because she is THEIR child. What they do is none of your fucking business, and it isn’t permission for you to do the same. You are not equal in Carly’s life. 

“When it’s beneficial for them to exploit Carly, they will” 

*Yuck. You guys suck. They have done nothing wrong.*

• Tyler says he never disrespected them or broke boundaries. Says the video he posted on Facebook when asked not to,that caused the conversation that was aired on TM, was when they were little kids, he says 17, 18. 

*One problem with the youth defence, Tyler - Cate was pregnant with Nova at the time and she was 23.*

• Cate believes in her heart of hearts it’s not Carly making this decision. They think that Brandon and Teresa are suffering from INFERTILITY TRAUMA AND INSECURE PARENTING! 

*AGAIN, you guys don’t KNOW Carly.*

AD BREAK - this time for Better Help LOLLLLLL. They are NOT poster children for mental health. So ironic. 

• They are asked if Carly gets recognised in public. 

Cate shared a really DISTURBING story that a fan messaged her once on social media to say “OMG I JUST SAW CARLY, she walked into my coffee shop”. 

*GROSS*

• Teresa told Dawn to pass on to Cate and Tyler they didn’t want to receive anymore gifts and that they didn’t want Cate and Tyler to tell anyone about that request. 

*Jordy acts so shocked and disgusted by this and Cate and Tyler are SALIVATING over it. 

We don’t care, guys. Of course they don’t want you to tell people because your fans are FUCKING INSANE. AND THEY HAVE SAID MULTIPLE TIMES TO STOP SHARING EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF INFORMATION. 

Ok, that’s all the talking points, but here are a few other observations: 

• Their end goal is to get the “truth out there” Tyler emphatically states MULTIPLE times that NO ONE should speak on their opinion publicly unless they have ALL the facts. 

Buddy, you only talk about shit you have no idea about. Being an adoptee, Carly’s feelings, etc. 

• Jordy asks if adoptees stories “gassed them up” they say no, it validated their experience and confirms they’re doing what they need to do. 

What you need to do is check into a mental health facility for a few months. 

• Lots of talk about the hypocrisy with Farrahs porn. They say they would apologise in person now that they’ve grown and their beliefs have changed but insist that she made it worse by insisting it was a leaked sex tape. 

Still, none of your business. Stfu about it. 

• Reason why they’re still talking about it and filming about it is because “what happens on Christmas when Graham is opening presents from birth mom and Carly has none to open for the first time in 15 years. Wow after 15 years I’m getting nothing? Why am I getting nothing?”

Speaking for Carly. Literally putting words in her mouth.

• Tyler gets excited talking about Teresa in their filmed conversation years ago about boundaries and posting photos. “If you pay attention to her delivery, she’s feisty.” Tyler then makes a mocking tone mimicking Teresa. Tyler and Cate say that she is passive aggressive or condescending and “spicy” and doesn’t respect their feelings but doesn’t want to be painted in that light. They say it was a missed opportunity for her “you could have been a voice in the community.”

They don’t WANT to be. Fuck off. 

Also YOURE MOCKING HER?! PUTTING ON A NAGGY TONE TO MIMIC HER?! 

Boy, you’ve fucked up. 

• Said they talk about body parts and sex all the time with their daughters because it’s a normal natural thing…

Um, I’m not touching that one. JFC.

1jpo1u6,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_thefarzin/comments/1jpo1u6/shredded_my_goose_pic_my_homie_crushed_his_bosss/,shredded my goose pic? my homie crushed his boss’s rules and exposed his dirty secret!,"
my friend idris recently shared a story from his first job, and i’m still in shock.idris was 17 when he started at this rundown call center. at home, he has a bunch of geese—he adores them, keeps them as pets, and even has a favorite named blinchik (russian for “pancake”). he brought a tiny photo of blinchik to work—just a wallet-sized card to lift his spirits in that dreary place. but his boss, dave, spotted it and threw a fit. dave had this ironclad rule: “no personal items on your desk. it’s about professionalism.” meanwhile, his own desk was cluttered with junk—old mugs, figurines, even some rusty fish statue. idris says dave had these odd quirks: he could be passively aggressive, muttering threats one minute and playing the nice guy the next. a strange guy.

so, dave noticed the goose photo and completely lost it. he forced idris to tear it up in front of everyone, mumbling something about “breaking the rules.” idris, a 17-year-old kid, panicked—he didn’t know how to stand up for himself back then and just went along with it. he says he nearly cried but held it in to avoid embarrassing himself in front of the team. the photo of blinchik was destroyed, and dave even smirked like it was his personal triumph.
idris held a grudge. the next day, he showed up empty-handed—no pen, no notepad, no headset. when dave asked what the hell was going on, idris calmly replied, “you said no personal items. i’m waiting for the company to provide my work stuff.” dave started freaking out, but idris stood his ground: “it’s your rule.” the team caught on—half of them stopped bringing their own gear too, and work ground to a halt. customers were screaming into phones, calls were dropping, and dave was running around trying to get everyone to “work normally.” finally, he gave up and grumbled, “fine, bring what you need, just keep it quiet.” idris came back with a new blinchik photo (of course) and set it on his desk. dave said nothing.

but that’s not the end. a couple of weeks later, dave tried to fire idris for “insubordination.” idris, now wiser, had recorded the whole “no personal items” incident on his phone (legal where we are) and sent it to hr with a complaint about dave’s double standards. hr didn’t fire dave, but they gave him a warning, and he backed off. then the real bomb dropped.
it turned out dave had been stealing from the cash box for years—small amounts, but regularly. according to idris, he cooked up this rule obsession to keep everyone on edge and distract from his schemes. he’d take cash from the petty cash drawer—meant for coffee, paper, random office stuff—and log it as “office needs.” the total was substantial, though no one’s mentioned an exact figure. his odd personality—passive-aggressive one minute, overly strict the next—helped him intimidate newbies like idris so no one would poke into his business. that photo scene? idris now thinks dave was just looking for a way to assert himself and throw people off.

in the end, dave got caught when a senior employee noticed the “office expenses” weren’t adding up. they fired him, and later even pressed charges. idris says he’s still proud of how he accidentally exposed a thief just by following dave’s ridiculous rules to the letter. blinchik, by the way, still lives in his yard and tries to nip at every guest.

1jpo1tb,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1jpo1tb/milksugar_lactose/,Milksugar (lactose),"I’ve been off sugar for 3 weeks now. I feel like a new person—life is more enjoyable, I have new goals and visions in mind. I feel more intelligent, have more testosterone, better focus, etc.

When you give up sugar, you also pretty much give up trans fats, since those are usually found in donuts, pastries, and sweets. So that’s likely another win for the body! Even the acne on my back has significantly decreased—there’s barely anything left to see.
Although I still treat myself occasionally, I never go over 20–30g of sugar per day, usually only when someone invites me and I want to be polite. My tip for sticking with this long term: allow yourself small treats in moderation.

My actual question is about milk sugar (lactose). At home, we have extracted milk sugar, and it helps a lot with constipation. I sometimes struggle with that when I don’t sleep well or feel unrested. Is milk sugar just as bad as fruit sugar or regular sugar? After all, it’s also extracted.
I took 4g today. I already have a daily sugar limit of 20g, but I’m curious—does anyone actually use milk sugar as a replacement for sugar in coffee, etc.?",1,1743599033.0,sugarfree,0,1.0,False
1jpo13o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/1jpo13o/whats_the_most_premium_slr_youve_handled_big_reply/,What's the most premium SLR you've handled - big reply,"I wrote this as a reply to another post, but apparently it is too large, so I'm making it a post...  
  
OK, so I'm in the unique position that I believe I've bought and handled them all.  I went on a mission to find the one I liked best, starting back in a couple years before covid before prices went back up.  I really went into overdrive during covid as something to do.  Here's the list of what I would consider the ""premium"" candidates.  In no particular order.  I'm not awake yet, so this is  just what springs forth as I drink my coffee: 

Canon EOS 1n, 1v, 3  
Canon F1 (all versions)  
Nikon F thru F6  
Pentax MZ-S  
Pentax KX, MX, LX  
Minolta XK  
Contax RTSII, N1  
Olympus OM-1N, OM-2SP, OM-3, PEN-FV  
Bronica S2A, ETRSi, GS  
Hasselblad 501cm, 503cw  
Mamiya 645 (most of these)  
Mamiya RB67 (have not used the RZ)  
Fuji GX680 III (beast)  
Pentax 67ii, 6x7, 645N, 645Nii  
Leica Leicaflex SL/SL2  
Contax 645 AF  
Rollei Rolleiflex SL66SE, 3003, & 6008  
Kowa Super 66  
  
So pretty much all of these feel premium.  There are exceptions of course, like the Mamiya 645e that's plastic-fantastic.  How did I control the GAS and decide what to keep?  What I ended up doing was using a spreadsheet where I set up categories, because with such a huge range of premium options, it gets \*really\* difficult to decide.  I don't keep ""shelf ornaments - I use what I own to take pictures. For SLRs, I decided on 3 ""slots"" - 1 manual focus 35mm, 1 autofocus 35mm. and 1 medium format (either AF or manual).  In the course of that, I would buy a new camera, try it, and if it was better, keep it and sell the current ""slot"".  So, after going through the above, where did I land?

Canon New F1 with laser matte J and spot metering, fit with the Speed Finder Fn prism (which also rotates vertical).  I also own the motor drive, 2 other prisms.  I do \*not\* own any ""nFD"" lenses, because they do \*not\* feel premium.  My favorite lens is the concave 35mm FD F2.  I have a 35-70mm FD 2.8-3.5 retrofit with teflon internals (All Canon FD/nFD zoom lenses \*will\* die  with use because they used rubber parts.

Canon EOS 3, with grip that takes 4xAA bats.  It's slightly lighter than the 1V and I can share glass with my RF body.  All lenses I use have image stabilization, which is a huge boon for film.

Bronica ETRSi, with various lenses, Rick Oleson focus screen, 35mm portrait film back, AE prism III, WLF finder, chimney finder, and speed grip

If you want to talk about pure mechanical ""joy"" in terms of premium feel, I submit you MUST include the lenses.  Due to that, for 35mm, I would choose the Leicaflex SL2 + any R lens.  It beats the F series, even the F2 Titan, because of the lenses. The SL2 was and is an over-engineered joy, on part with any Leica M body.  Leica lost money on every one they made :)  Honorable mention to the PEN half frames, they're super satisfying.

For medium format mechanical, it's a tie for me.  The Bronica S2A is just, something you have to use to appreciate the crazy engineering with the way the mirror slides down \*under\* the film plane.  At the same time, the SL66 is has it's own ""feel"" that I can't quite put into words.  I think the SL66 would have beaten Hasselblad if not for the ill-conceived agreement between Victor Hasselblad and Reinhold that they would not complete with each other.  The Hasselblad is just as premium, and fitted with the acute matte screen, has a better viewfinder.  Upgrading to a Rick Oleson focus screen or a Beattie Intenscreen on the S2A or SL66 gets you up to par with the acute matte screen though.

For electronic manual focus 35mm, the F3 and New F1 are on the same level.  My issue is that the F3 has the annoying LED lights.  I cannot handle LEDs in a prism.  The other is the prism - the Speed Finder FN is THE BEST prism you will encounter on ANY SLR ever, most especially if you use glasses, where the eye relief is phenomenal.  There is no comparable prism for the F series, or any other 35mm.

For medium format electronic, they're all premium feeling.  It's important to remember they all sold for thousands of dollars, even back then.  I can say the Mamiya 645 series, the lenses, even the 80mm F1.9, do not feel premium.  The Pentax 645 series, the buttons do not feel premium.  Stuff like that - nitpicks mostly.  I think it's more important to look at serviceability, reliability, and lenses at this point.  Weighing the options, the Pentax 67 series is king, because of the number of repair shops and it's relative reliability.  I never even bothered trying the RZ, because I didn't want to take a loss on a camera dying.  I also did not keep any autofocus MF body because I didn't want to grow attached to a disposable camera.  Many of the medium format bodies I listed above, while the feel crazy premium (the Rollei 6k series), I do not recommend.  

Listing the cameras I've bought that died or had serious issues while using them:

Contax 645 (electrical contacts issues)  
Mamiya AFDii (ded)  
Pentax 645Nii (LED top panel bleed / fade)  
Pentax 645N shutter button wonky  
Rollei 6008 battery pain  
... and too many 35mm issues to list  


As my coffee runs out...  How ""premium"" these cameras feel will be heavily influenced by what they've been through.  A beat up body will \*not\* feel premium.  I always obtained both the newest and the best sample I could.  My New F1?  Likely made in 1991.  My Bronica ETRSi?  2002.  My EOS 3?  2006.  These are mechanical devices and the internal components age.  The lenses should not be ignored either.  Newer models = more reliable as a general rule.  My Bronica zooms were late 90s, primes even newer.  While my FD lenses are old, they're serviced and known failure points addressed.  

Anyway, that was a lot.  Perhaps I should write a book, LOL.

1jpo04v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1jpo04v/building_a_faithbased_company_culture/,Building a Faith-Based Company Culture,"Building a business culture rooted in faith and values isn't just for big corporations – it can be a vibrant part of your journey as a solopreneur too. It’s not about slapping scripture on a plaque and calling it a day; it’s about weaving those principles into the very fabric of what you do, every single day. So, let’s get into some creative ways you can do this, without losing your mind or your lunch.

1. **Daily Devotions (or Coffee Chats with God):** Start your day not just with a cup of coffee, but with a moment to refocus. Take five minutes to read a verse or meditate on a thought that inspires you. This isn't just for your personal grounding; it can also guide your decision-making throughout the day. You'd be surprised how clarity can transform a 10-minute coffee chat with the Creator into marketing genius.

2. **Values as Your Guiding Light:** Define your core values as vigorously as you would define your target market. Write them down, post them where you work (real or virtual), and let them become your decision-making compass. If integrity or service is a pillar for your business, make it a habit to ask yourself how every project aligns with those values. Spoiler alert: You're going to feel better about your choices.

3. **Community Involvement:** Just because you’re flying solo doesn’t mean you can’t have a community! Seek out local charities or initiatives where your skills might be helpful. Whether you offer your services pro bono or mentor someone just starting out, putting your time into the world not only shows your values in action, but it builds connections that are priceless.

4. **Transparent Communication:** Be authentic in your interactions. Share not just the triumphs but the struggles too. When clients or followers see the real you—the vulnerable you—they’re more likely to connect with your mission. It's like saying, ""Hey, I might not have this all figured out, but I'm doing my best, and so can you!"" This creates a culture of openness and relatability.

5. **Mission Statement:** Craft a mission statement that speaks to your core values. Make it personal; let it reflect why you started this wild ride in the first place. It’ll serve as a reminder during the tough times, and who knows? It might just resonate with your clients too!

6. **Ethical Practices:** From sourcing materials to dealing with clients, let your faith influence your business ethics. Whether that’s committing to fair trade suppliers or offering honest pricing. Remember, integrity is, like, a big deal. People really do notice when you're consistent in doing the right thing.

7. **Gratitude Practice:** Develop a habit of gratitude, both for yourself and your clients. Celebrate small wins—whether it’s a successful pitch or simply finishing a task you put off for too long. Send a handwritten thank-you card to a client who referred you to someone else; this simple act of kindness reflects your values.

8. **Reflective Journaling:** Make time to reflect on your business journey. What has God been teaching you? What experiences have brought you closer to your values? Journaling can be a powerful way to process your experiences and notice the ways faith is manifesting in your work.

9. **Prayer Partners or Accountability Groups:** Even as a one-person operation, you can invite others on your journey. Find a few folks who share similar beliefs and support each other. Whether it’s prayer for your business or just sharing life updates, these connections can nourish you in times of need.

As you dive into these practices, remember that incorporating faith into your business culture is less about rigid protocols and more about flexibility, resilience, and authenticity. Invite the transformative journey of faith into your work, and who knows? You might just find your influence growing beyond what you ever imagined. Keep saying “yes” to God's plan, and watch what unfolds!",1,1743598906.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

I’m taller than most, dark brown hair, usually with a beard. I like to consider myself 50% homebody and 50% adventurer.

I love to travel, explore new cities and countries but also stay in with a good cup of black coffee and a book or movie.

My hobbies include but are certainly not limited to: reading, cooking, working out, distance running, traveling, and painting every now and then.

I work a lot in a white collar profession so my free time is very important to me.

Chapter 4: The Dream Sequence - Storm Front



Later on that same day. It was around late evening at Natani and Zen's safehouse which is a low-end apartment somewhere in the city. 



Natani is washing her face over the sink at the bathroom as she prepares heading off to bed. Once she was done washing, she grabbed a towel and smeared it over her face to dry it off. As Natani walked out of the bathroom, she went to the living room where she catches Zen, who is asleep on the couch, snoring loudly with his tongue sticking out while the TV was left running on. Natani sat beside her brother as she picked up the remote from the center table, which was scattered with empty bottles of beer and discarded cigars. Before turning the TV off, she saw a late evening news report about the failed armed robbery incident at the grocery store from earlier on that day. Upon seeing the details that were mentioned, Natani felt uneasy and grossed out, forcing her to shut the TV off. Looking over to Zen, Natani stood up from the couch and checked if he was still asleep. She then leaned in and kissed his cheek. As she pulled away, Natani heads off to her room. Once putting on her sleepwear which is a typical long t-shirt, she lay down on her bed and turned off the lamp by the bedside table to catch some sleep. 



A few hours later, Natani suddenly wakes up only to find herself stranded in the middle of an empty yet endless stretch of road somewhere in the desert. She looked around her surroundings where she saw nothing other than dozens of cactuses scattered across the landscape and a few tumbleweeds rolling by. Now feeling tired and exhausted due to the scorching heat, Natani thought of hitchhiking for a ride. She stood by next to a speed limit sign waiting for a 'mutual friend' to come pick her up. After a while, she noticed a car moving on the distance which gave her an opportunity to hold up a thumb signal while standing at the edge of the road, hoping for the driver to stop by and pick her up. The oncoming car began to slow down, pulling up beside her in a complete stop. The driver reached in to open the passenger door for her. Upon getting into the car, Natani is greeted by ""The Other Natani"" who'll be driving her throughout the entire journey. 



""So At last."" He said, smoking a cigarette in his mouth. ""Welcome again.""



Natani turned to look at him but she decided to stay quiet while keeping a straight face.



 ""I imagine, that you ran into some new friends lately.""



Natani was surprised, ""By what do you mean? And what exactly does this have to do with them?"" 



""I can see it through your eyes. You'll see."" 



He leaned in to turn the radio on, transitioning the dial to a news broadcast. 



""As we follow up on the failed armed robbery incident at the grocery store in downtown, which happened on Tuesday morning. We hereby mention the four good samaritans who bravely fought back against the perpetrators: Trace Legacy, 24yr old human. Flora Collins, 11yr old tiger keidran. Keith Keiser, 20yr old basitin and combat veteran who previously served in the Gulf War. and lastly is--."" 



He shut the radio off before the reporter could mention her on the broadcast. 



""Oh.. right, about that."" Natani sighed, ""What's on your mind, big guy?"" She asked. 



""I strongly advise you to accept them as your close friends from here and out."" He responded. 



She scoffed and insisted, ""Do you think that's even a good idea? I only got to know them by their names you know."" 



""I can't think of other options, dear."" He replied. 



""So let me get this straight: You wanted me to join in with those three so I can live? Bullshit. I can just rely on Zen or myself. I don't need your shitty advice!"" 



As soon as he finished smoking, he lowered his window and threw the cigarette butt out before closing up the window shortly afterwards. 



He glanced at her and replied, ""Natani, dear, you cannot be relying upon yourself and your brother forever."" He added, ""I'll be frank with you about this. Without them on your side, you wouldn't be able to last long out there by your own. Especially when your arch-nemisis is still lurking around.""



It took some time for Natani as she was reluctant at first. Eventually, she changed her mind and accepts his advice. 



""Alright.. I guess I don't have much of a choice."" 



""Very well, dear. You have just made a wise decision for today."" 



Natani sighed and looked away from him by turning her head to face the window. She watched the desert landscape past by while traveling along. 



""If I'm not mistaken, I think you were showing your feelings to that basitin you had encountered earlier."" The Other Natani gives off a smug look upon teasing her. 



Natani tensed up and blushed, ""How DARE you BRING that up!"" She yelled at him in anger, slamming her fists over the dashboard. 



He chuckled, ""I can see what you're up to, my dear. Let me guess? Basitins are your kind of type."" 



""Ugh.. Whatever, dude. Just shut up."" Natani slumped herself across the passenger seat. She crossed her arms upon being embarrassed by him.



After a short while of driving, they soon arrived at an abandoned gas station, where most of its windows and doors have been boarded up. The building itself has badly deteriorated, and its structural design heavily dates back from the 1950s. Upon pulling up next to the gas pumps, he shut the ignition off as he went to unbuckled his seatbelt then stepped out of his car to observe the area. Natani also got out of the car as well. While she went to explore around for a bit, Natani's ears suddenly perked up when she heard a phone ringing which is coming from a phonebooth nearby. Out of curiosity, she decided to approach it until all of a sudden, The Other Natani rushes to her from behind, grabbing onto her arm as he stopped her from going further.



""I wouldn't answer that phone if I were you."" 



Natani gasped and trembled, ""W-Why not..?""



He warned Natani, pulling her close to him as they take a few steps back. ""All I know for certain is, whoever is calling through that phonebooth is luring you to walk into its trap."" 



""Okay, okay.. Understood.""



Natani decided to stick close with him by leaning herself against the rear quarter panel of his car. As The Other Natani opened up the trunk, he picked up a crowbar which was laying above the spare tire. He then closes the lid shut before locking it up. 



""The pumps are obviously empty but I figured there'd be gas inside that store.""



Upon walking up to the front door, Natani watched from behind as he tries to remove every single wooden boards with his crowbar. Once he was able to get the door open, she followed after him as he led the way. Walking into the store, it was completely dark and there was nothing much to see besides several shelves knocked over and oil cans scattered on the floor. Upon reaching the door which leads them to the janitor's closet, The Other Natani figured that it was sealed shut so he decided to kick it open with full force. Once as he forcefully kicked the door open, the two of them walked into the small closet where they discovered a couple of gas cans underneath the shelves which was packed with miscellaneous and other discarded tools.



""Jackpot.."" He said. 



Natani just stood close with him as he leaned over to grab a gas can underneath the shelf. 



He turned around at Natani and told her to bring the other gas can on the way back. 



""Get that can of gasoline and follow me back to the car."" He called. 



""Got it."" Natani responded.  



As soon as Natani picked up the gas can, she followed after him as they headed back outside to refuel the car. Moments later, the sky above them suddenly turned dark and cloudy, indicating that a thunderstorm will start anytime soon. 



""No time on standing around. We must hurry soon."" He encourages her to give a helping hand. 



Natani responded by nodding back to him. She came to assist him on filling up the tank with gasoline. The storm clouds above them rumbled as raindrops began to pour with lightning and thunder joining in. 



With the storm catching up, they must not waste much time. Upon emptying the first can, Natani inserted the last can into the filler neck as they proceed on refueling up the car. The Other Natani decided to turn around, only to see a giant tornado at the distance not far away. Closing in and heading directly towards them. 



""C'mon! Get the lead out!"" He yelled desperately. 



Natani replied loud and clear, ""I hear ya! I'm going as fast as I can."" 



Soon after they were able to fill up the tank full, both Natani and The Other Natani rushed back into the car. He inserts the key into the ignition as Natani buckled up her seatbelt. He desperately tries to start up the car but to no avail. With the tornado catching up towards them, an idea suddenly popped into his head. He turned to Natani and looked at her. 



""I have an idea,"" He added, ""I'll give it a push from the back. You try starting it up."" 



""What?!"" 



He shouted back, ""It's the only way!"" 



He gets out and ran to the back of his car as he tries pushing it further, forcing him to use all of his strength. Natani unbuckled her seatbelt, sliding over to the driver seat as she attempts on starting up the car. She began to grew more desperate but didn't let herself to panic. 



""DAMMIT, DAMMIT, DAMMIT, DAMMIT! COME ON! START UP ALREADY YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT!""



Eventually after multiple attempts, Natani was soon able to get the car started up and running. She reached over to open the passenger door for him. 



""QUICK! GET IN!!"" She yelled out desperately, signaling him to make a run for it. 



The Other Natani took his chance and jumps back inside, pulling the passenger side door shut. Now flooring it as fast while she can as they drive further down the road, Natani looked into the rear-view mirror and watched in horror upon seeing the gas station being violently torn apart by the strong winds as the tornado completely obliterates the entire site, leaving nothing standing left on it's path. 



Now driving 100mph down the endless stretch of road, Natani ensured her foot was on the accelerator, not slowing down anytime until they're at a safe distance. After some quite time, the sky had reverted back to normal. She began to ease off the throttle and continue cruising to an acceptable speed. 



Natani exhaled in relief, ""That.. was close.""



The Other Natani said nothing. Instead, he took out a flask from his trenchcoat, after drinking his whiskey for a little bit, he then lit up another cigarette with his lighter and proceeded to smoke for a while. 



""Do you mind if I listen to some tunes?"" She asked. 



After an awkward pause, he turned at her and responded. 



""Go ahead."" 



As she leaned in to turn the dial tune, the radio began to play the song ""Piece of My Heart"" by Big Brother & The Holding Company. 



""Sweet! One of my personal favorites."" 



As cheerful and happy Natani was upon hearing one of her favorite songs, she began vibing along with the music on the radio for a while. After a few minutes have passed by, The Other Natani decided to pull out his hourglass from underneath his trenchcoat. Upon looking closely through the hourglass, he soon realizes that the duration of the dream paradox has entirely ran out, forcing him to interrupt Natani who was rocking halfway through the guitar solo. 



""Our time has passed, dear. I need you to pull over now.""



""Oh, okay then..?"" 



Natani went to pull the car over at the side of the road. He turned and gazed upon her as he slowly prepares on touching her forehead with his index finger. 



""Your friends are waiting for you on the other side, stay close with them."" He added, ""And most importantly, make sure all of them are safe from your arch-nemisis."" 



Natani looked at him and nodded, ""I promise, I'll look after them and do whatever it takes, Master.""



The Other Natani lowered his sunglasses, smiling upon her. 



""Don't forget to stay vigilant out there. Until we meet again..""



Immediately once he gently pressed his finger down to her forehead, Natani suddenly woke up gasping for air only to find herself back in her room. The time was now 6:50am in the morning as shown from the alarm clock at the bedside table. As Natani slowly got out of bed, she stretched her arms for a bit before deciding to walk out of her room. Upon walking out, Natani was greeted by Zen who is sitting at the dining table with his morning coffee. 



""Hey, morning 'lil Sis! How are ya feelin'?""



Natani responded, ""The usual.. What about you, big bro?""



""I'm feeling pretty good."" Zen replied back, drinking his coffee. ""Here, I made breakfast for the two of us.""



""That's sweet of you, Zen.."" 



Natani went to open the fridge to grab a carton of milk. Once closing the fridge, she began to drink up the milk from the carton box. She then walked over to the table and sat next to Zen. The siblings started eating through their breakfast of the day which consists of steak and eggs. There was a moment of silence around them for a while until Zen spoke up. 



""Say, did you hear the news from yesterday about that botched grocery store robbery?"" 



""Oh yeah? Tell me about it.."" Natani replied. 



""I was quite surprised to hear that you were one of the four bystanders who fought back."" Zen added, ""Hell, you pulled off the coolest dropkick on the last guy! I saw one of the interviews of the witnesses and those bystanders you were with--"" 



Natani yelled abruptly cutting off Zen,

""Will you SHUT the FUCK UP for once, Zen! I'm in no mood on HEARING that crap, ya hear?!"" 



She slammed her fists on the table and immediately stood up from her chair, walking away from him. She then stood still in front of a window overlooking the view of the city from their run-down apartment. Zen also stood up worried as he followed after his sister to check on her. 



""Jeez, Natani.. I- I'm sorry if I brought that up. I didn't mean to make you mad."" Zen apologized regretfully. 



""It's alright.."" Natani said, growing scared. ""It's just.. I'm starting to fear if that greedy asshat finds out all this-- Fuck! I can't even say his name."" 



Zen walked closer to Natani, touching her shoulder as he tries to calm her down. 



""Well, it's too late since that was shown all over the news throughout the city."" He added, ""I bet him and his henchmen are probably on alert by now. It looks like we're gonna have to keep our heads low for a while."" 



""I know.. We've been watching our backs for the past several months. That ruthless son-of-a-bitch and his boys ain't gonna stop until he finally gets the chance to bury us alive with each other, or worse than that..""

I am loving it but wonder what I can add to make it even more interesting as I really enjoy sitting and watching it in the morning while I drink my coffee. I’ll do a closeup video of some of the residents in the comments. 

I currently have 10 zebra danios who are the tank masters and bullies. They mostly stay in the top 1/3 of the tank. 
I have 6 neon tetras and a lone survivor rummynose tetras that school together. Sometimes the rummynose likes to pretend to be a danio too. They hang in the bottom 1/2. 

I have 5 Cory’s which are maybe my fav to watch. 

I have a shy guy pearl gourami. He’s little now, but I do expect him to be magnificent in here. 

I have a little baby bristle nose pleco that hides. He’s a really scarty cat, but he cute. Always fun when I find him.

I have 5 amano shrimp which I also love to watch. 
I have a handful of red and blue shrimp that I don’t see much at all except the occasional glimpse 

I have 2 Nerite snails 

Probs a few bladder snails or rams. 

I am considering rehoming my more aggressive danios that seem super territorial of the whole surface. Hoping to stop the aggressive behavior by thinning the numbers and getting rid of the ring leader. But maybe that’s not necessary. 

I was considering getting a school of super tiny chili rasborras because the rummynose red really bursts in the tank and looks amazing. I’m hoping to get a fish that would like to occupy more of the open water on the right half of my tank. I am also considering a smaller school of lemon tetras.

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and would love some advice from people who may have been through something similar. I’m feeling completely lost, even though I have two job offers that most people would consider amazing. Here’s the situation:

I have a wonderful girlfriend, and I’ve recently received two job offers: one as an environmental advisor (national position), and the other as a remote land referencing role. On paper, these opportunities look great, but I’ve never been more anxious about my future.

Since university, I’ve been working non-stop, juggling a graduate geoscientist role while finishing my dissertation. I’ve always felt pressure to pursue a career that aligns with my degree, so when these job offers came up, I thought they would be a good step forward. However, as I’ve sat with them, I’ve realised I don’t want to live a life stuck in a 9-5 job for the rest of my life.

What’s become clear to me is that the things I actually value are the simple moments in life: spending time with my girlfriend, going to the beach, drinking coffee, and enjoying my local surroundings in Swansea. I’ve realised that I don’t care much about material possessions, expensive holidays, or climbing the corporate ladder. What I want is a life that allows me more time for the things that truly matter to me.

Now I’m at a crossroads. I’m seriously considering turning down both job offers, quitting for a while, and using my savings to cover my expenses while I figure things out. I’m thinking about taking up something low-stress like working in a coffee shop for a while to give myself space to reflect on what I really want, but I don't know if this is viable, or a good idea for my long-term future. I feel completely lost, constantly seeking and searching for advice online and getting no where.

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please read this post in full before messaging me 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

Context: First girlfriend ko (32M) sya (30F) at first boyfriend nya naman ako. I was 22 and she was 20 back then. We were together for 3 yrs. We were young but I am sure what we had was real. Walang cheating na nangyari, no other people involved. We just literally outgrew each other, since we were starting to build and prove something back then. She landed her first job, and I got busy chasing my own dreams. Hanggang sa nawalan na kami ng time sa isat-isa. We broke up in good terms, we handled the break up in a very mature manner. 

We eventually moved on, nag-iba din ako ng facebook account for some reason kaya nawalan na ng balita sa isat-isa. It also helped us moving forward na we do not share the same circle of friends. 

Nagkaroon naman din ako ng isang girlfriend after few years but it did not work out. Sya? Di ko alam. Never heard of her name for the longest time. 

Not until last March 1, 2025. I had to run some errand sa isang mall sa South. I was walking then a familiar face is walking din towards my direction. Hindi ako pwedeng magkamali, yung mukha na yun, kabisado ko ang bawat anggulo kahit nakapikit ako. 

Nagulat ako, nagulat din sya. We greeted each other awkwardly. Mag-isa lang sya, sure ako kasi inikot ikot ko mata ko baka may kasama na syang asawa. Nagkamustahan kami, then pasimple kong tinanong kung kasama nya asawa nya. Tapos hinampas nya ako sabi nya wala daw syang balak, then I loosen up. She waa still the same person I used to love when I was 22. 

Ofcourse I asked san sya, then sabi nya, kakain sya, ako na kakatapos lang kumain ay nagrason na kakain din ako. Then tinanong ko kung gusto nya sumabay and mag catch up kami. She said yes naman. 

Habang kumakain kami, gusto ko na lang ipause yung moment na yun. God, I missed her so much. Gumanda sya lalo, she still uses the same scent when we were dating. We also grabbed some coffee after. 

We part ways. Pag-uwi ko, inistalk ko sya. Added her and she accepted after a few minutes. Ofcourse, we exchanged chats as if we were still teenaagers! I'm chatting with her right now and di ko ma-contain yung kilig ko. 

Nagpost sya sa story nya kagabi ng lyrics di ko lang alam kaninong kanta pero ang sabi sa lyrics

""All along there was some invisible string tying you to me?""

Normal lang ba sa isang 30 yrs old na mag assume at kiligin??

Advice needed: Can you help me what to do? Most specially to the ladies here. 

Edit: Dahil sa mga nakakalokong advice, nag story din ako ng Lyrics ng Marry Me by Train. 

Tapos nag reply sya ng ""Sino naman? 😛😛"" 

Ano yan? Haha",709,1743597085.0,adviceph,325,0.95,False

I get a lot of DMs from people asking for help with their dating app profiles, relationship advice, and general life guidance. While I love helping out, my full-time job makes it impossible to assist everyone individually. So, I had an idea—why not offer my services as a dating coach?

To start, I’m thinking of a **30-minute consultation** for a **nominal fee** (less than the price of a cup of coffee at Third Wave). This is a pretty common service in the US/UK, but I wanted to see if there’s demand for it in India—especially in **Bangalore**, since most of my requests come from here.

From what I’ve observed, many people feel self-conscious or judged when discussing dating and relationship issues with friends or family. Therapy can be expensive, and a lot of men mainly have male friends who may not always offer a female perspective.

I have **a lot of experience** in this space and genuinely believe this could be a helpful side hustle. So, what do you guys think? Would you be interested in something like this? Do you see a market for it?

And of course, I love reading the hilarious comments on this sub—that’s the OG vibe here! Looking forward to your thoughts.",0,1743596763.0,CATpreparation,8,0.13,False

Don't get me wrong, I like the modules and the topics, I think they're honestly interesting and are seriously good precursor learning before going into science. 

However, I hate the format.

It's one thing to be forced into a class that you don't even want. It's another thing to be forced to pay for it. I can tolerate these two things. However why must it be compulsory to attend the studios? It genuinely annoys me because the studios are literally just downscaled lectures and 80% awkward conversations. We literally get marks for showing up, making ineffective small talk and conversation with our groupmates, and it's overall just ineffective and just several more hours of filler workload. 

I don't mind the modules, or the labs, but I'm seriously about to bash my head into the wall about the studios.

Most unfortunately, I scored the 9-10am sessions, and I work late closing shifts at a job to support my family. I also live a good distance away. I thought this was manageable until the semester actually kicked up, so I contacted the course coordinator if I could switch streams. Unfortunately every stream is full and I got told to cope. (I was told to just suck it up and have an extra coffee in the morning 😭 literally.) 

I'm so tired and tied up. I honestly don't know how to deal with this. If anyone has any advice, I would love to hear from you. Cheers!",3,1743596757.0,UoApremed,0,1.0,False

Paying It Forward

After answering approximately 1,500 practice questions in three weeks, today I took my PMP Exam and received a provisional pass on my first attempt.

I couldn’t have done this without this community, so I am paying it forward for future takers by sharing my experience and what works for me.

Brief Background
I have an engineering degree, and I recently obtained my master’s degree in Construction Management. My experience is primarily with traditional/waterfall frameworks.

Resources/Study Material
1) PMP Exam Prep by TIA on Udemy (Mr. Andrew Ramdayal): Finished it on March 8, 2025. I answered the full mock exam at the end (My Score: 66).
2) Study Hall Plus: Purchased on March 12, 2025. This is a must! It trains your mind and builds your stamina in answering questions. My Study Hall scores on the full mocks were 66, 62, 72, and 60, respectively. I used these results to assess which topics I needed to focus on. I also completed the mini quizzes (20 sections, 15 questions each; my average score is 66).
3) 200 Ultra Hard Questions by AR on YouTube: Great for applying and developing the PM mindset. I pause the video to answer each question, then listen to his explanation.
4) 150 PMBOK 7 Scenario-Based Questions by DM on You
5) 110 Drag and Drop Questions by DM on YouTube: Excellent for testing your knowledge.
6) 100 PMBOK 6th Edition Questions and Answers by DM on YouTube: I answered 75 of these, which helped build my stamina for answering questions.
7) PMBOK Guide 6th Edition Process Explained by Ricardo Vargas on YouTube
8) Mohammed Rahman Mindset on YouTube
9) The PMP Fast Track by DM on YouTube
10) PMP subreddit: For tips, encouragement, and guidance.

Routine/Advice:
- Juggling Work and Studying: I use the first 2–3 hours of my workday to study—whether it’s browsing the PMP subreddit, watching lectures, answering questions, or listening to mindset videos. I make sure to manage my time wisely by planning my daily schedule and notes the night before.

- Feeling Burned Out: At some point, you’ll feel burned out, but you must push through. Be persistent and consistent. Rest if you must, but always remind yourself how badly you want this.

- Being Physically and Mentally Strong: I make it a point to get 10,000 steps every night, during which I disconnect from everything. I listen to AR’s mindset videos or assess where I might be lacking, so I know what topics I need to study more.

- Training for Stamina: Train yourself to answer questions. Initially, I felt exhausted by the sheer number of questions, but by pushing myself, I prepared well for the battle.

- Overstudying: It’s true that Study Hall questions are more difficult than those on the actual exam, so do not be overconfident. Prepare yourself well—what do you have to lose by overstudying?

Exam Experience (Today)
I am an expat working overseas and did not take the exam in my home country.

- Morning Routine: Get up early, eat a heavy breakfast, and have coffee. Avoid heavy eating during the 10-minute breaks in the exam.

- At the Testing Center: I arrived at 8:00 a.m., filled out some forms, and was briefly oriented by Pearson VUE personnel—who happened to be my countrymen and were very accommodating. They explained the exam flow, the breaks, the prohibited items, and other procedures.

- During the Exam: My scheduled start was at 9:00 a.m. The exam questions were similar to Study Hall’s moderate-to-difficult questions (with a few expert-level ones) and were less wordy. I encountered 5–8 drag-and-drop questions and one calculation about PERT. I took both 10-minute breaks to drink water, use the restroom, stretch, and grab some coffee before returning to the exam room. Each section was allocated 80 minutes. I flagged some questions that I second-guessed and later reviewed them. I used all the available time on all three sections for answering and reviewing these flagged questions.

- After the Exam: You will be asked to complete a survey, sign in, and log the time you finished the test before receiving your provisional result.

Imagine a world where humanity cracked the secrets of interdimensional travel—only to catch the attention of an ancient, godlike race that sees such power as a cosmic *crime*. Their response? A brutal war that left Earth in ruins, its population nearly wiped out. But we *survived*.

Now, centuries later, Earth is a fragmented, post-apocalyptic battleground where lost technology and chaotic magic intertwine. Small, highly advanced cities struggle to rebuild under strict laws, while the wastelands beyond are ruled by scavengers, warlords, and those who dare to tamper with unstable magic.

This is the world of **Umbra: The Reap**, a tabletop RPG where players take on the role of survivors, rebels, and explorers, navigating the remains of a shattered world while wielding dangerous, unpredictable magic and salvaging forgotten technology. The game combines classic *Old School* mechanics with a unique twist—magic is unstable, technology is a lifeline, and the secrets of the past could determine the future of humankind.

I'm also wary of ashwagandha - lots of people have negative opinions of this and I understand why, but my main concern is in the long term.

1jpn5u0,https://paranormaldergi.com/en/because-grandfathers-sin-paranormal-story/,Because Of My Grandfather's Sin,"As night blended into day, the women of the Kahraman family had prepared the dinner table and were waiting for the men to arrive. Gülşah called out to her daughter Esma, warning her to come join them now, but it was impossible for Esma to hear her mother at that moment. Due to the severe seizure (‘sara krizi’) she was having, she was trembling violently on the floor, praying to God for someone to see her and help. It felt as if an invisible hand had grasped her heart in its palms, squeezing until her last strength was gone.

“Oh God, help me, please someone see me! I can’t take it anymore…” As she prayed these words inwardly, the seizure intensified, and saliva drooling from her mouth continued to flow down towards her throat. From what she had heard on television, if she could turn onto her side, she might have a chance of recovery, but some force prevented her from doing so. “I can’t breathe, God, help me, please!” Her body had now entered a rhythmic tremor. Esma’s vision blurred, everything around her becoming hazy.

Gülşah Hanım, seeing her daughter hadn’t come, placed the napkin in her hand on the table and started walking towards her daughter’s room, grumbling. “Oh, dear daughter, what would happen if you just came when I called you once? Always doing the opposite of what I say, always!” Reaching Esma’s door, Gülşah Hanım opened it at once and entered. The sight she encountered made her cover her mouth and scream. She immediately rushed to her daughter’s side and knelt down. Taking Esma’s head onto her lap, Gülşah Hanım, amidst tears, gently tapped her daughter’s face to wake her up while also calling out to the men of the house. She knew the men had arrived from the sound of the bell hanging on the garden’s iron gate. “Ali Bey! Mehmet! Run! Esma is lying on the floor, run!”

The men of the house, without understanding what was happening, ran fearfully towards Esma’s room upon hearing the cries. When they reached the room, faced with what they saw through the open door, they were initially unsure what to do. After a few moments, Esma’s older brother, Mehmet, quickly went to Esma’s side, picked her up in his arms, and started running towards the car. As the entire family hastily left the house to go to the hospital, Esma was in a very different world, a terrifying dimension.

Esma was awakened by snow-white flakes falling from the sky onto her face. She rubbed her eyes, trying to understand where she was, but her head hurt so much she couldn’t comprehend anything. “Where am I?” She slowly stood up and looked around. All she could see was that she was on something like a cloud. Noticing the snow falling on her, she looked down at herself and saw she was wearing a dress made of pure white tulle. There were gold embroideries on the belt of the dress. “When did I put this on? Where am I?”

As she walked slowly on the endless cloud masses, she noticed something; despite the falling snow, she didn’t feel cold. She had shouted repeatedly, but received no response from anyone. She walked, and walked, and walked… She herself didn’t know how long she had walked. Her feet had started to ache. Her body was gradually warming up. Wiping the sweat trickling down her forehead, she tried to understand why this was suddenly happening. “Mom! Dad! Brother! Where are you? I’m scared!” Just as she was about to collapse from exhaustion, dark figures suddenly began to appear around her. Some of these figures were tall, some short. Some were fat, some very thin. It was clear they hadn’t taken on a physical form, and their faces were indistinct. “Who are you? Please help me! I beg you, please!”

Ahkeran, the leader of the tribe, felt himself grow stronger witnessing Esma’s terrified state. “Fool! Soon we will make you experience the worst kind of fear! This is nothing yet!” Giving instructions to the demonic entities, Ahkeran ordered Esma to be taken to the place where her end would come. “It is time for vengeance! Seconds, milliseconds, years have passed! Now is the time for blood!” As Ahkeran savored the pleasure of the revenge he would exact, Esma was grabbed by the arm by the unseen entities and began to be dragged towards the place Ahkeran indicated. Esma’s screams and struggles were in vain; no one could hear her voice.

Thrown into a dark dungeon, Esma sat huddled, arms wrapped around her legs, helplessly waiting for what was to come. She didn’t know how many hours she had been there. “Oh God, help me, please…” Just as her tears were about to dry, the entity that suddenly appeared before her made her recoil in fear. “Oh God, protect me from the evil of the wicked, of Satan, of demons, of jinn!” Ahkeran began to approach Esma, cackling. His blood-red eyes, grayish filthy skin, and the insects emerging from his wound-covered body made him appear even more horrifying. “Time for revenge, filthy human! Time for revenge!” Ahkeran grabbed Esma’s hair with his long-nailed hands and began dragging her across the dark dungeon, throwing her from place to place, towards the torture site. In the silent dungeon, only Esma’s screams pleading for help now echoed. Hearing this sound, the demon-souled jinn began to gather, not wanting to miss the feast.

“Get the patient on the stretcher immediately! Inform Dr. Fırat!” As the hospital staff quickly placed Esma on the stretcher and rushed her towards the emergency room, Esma’s body began to suffer just like her soul. Her fever slowly rose, and cold sweat poured from her body. Dr. Fırat, sipping his coffee in his room, quickly got up upon receiving the call on his phone and ran towards the emergency room. When he reached the emergency floor, after getting the necessary information from the nurses, he began the initial treatment for Esma. The countdown for a life to be rekindled had begun…

Ahkeran threw Esma into a cage filled with hot and sharp iron bars and quickly locked the cage door. “Why are you doing this to me? What did I ever do to you?!” As Esma looked at Ahkeran with fear-filled eyes, Ahkeran looked back at Esma with eyes full of hatred and vengeance and began to explain the reason for his revenge. All the jinn gathered around listened to Ahkeran with curiosity: “Exactly 50 years ago, your great-grandfather Hasan got involved in something he never should have. He deceived my entire family and trapped them all one night, killing them! Before my father died, I promised him; I would take the life of the most precious person in the family of the man called Hasan! And that person is you, YOU!”

“Why am I paying the price for the evil my grandfather did? Don’t do this, please!” Ahkeran stared into Esma’s eyes with his blood-red gaze. Grabbing the cage’s chain, he roared with all his might: “O cursed human! I take vengeance on you and your lineage! I will drink every drop of your blood as wine!” Following these words, Ahkeran let out a terrifying laugh, gripped the chain tightly, and began slamming the cage against the ground with all his strength. Although Esma screamed and cried from the pain, it only served to further enrage Ahkeran. Being thrown against the sharp parts inside the cage, Esma’s body was covered in cuts. The deep wounds forming on her body burned every time they touched the hot iron, and the smell of burning flesh filled the entire dungeon. Just as Esma was about to pass out, Ahkeran, wanting her to suffer more, began plunging the cage into the blazing fire and pulling it out repeatedly. “Oh God, help me, please!” As Esma recited her last prayer before losing consciousness, the pain whispered in her ear that death was near. “Let your God come and save you, filthy human! If He has the power, that is!”

Dr. Fırat was utterly frozen by the sight before him. On the stretcher lay Esma, her body covered in massive, deep wounds, and the blood within the wounds was literally boiling like water, bubbling furiously. “Doctor, what are we going to do?” Looking fearfully at Nurse Melek, Dr. Fırat tried to moisten his dry throat with saliva. “I don’t know, Nurse Melek… This is the first time in my life I’ve encountered such savagery!” As Esma burned to ashes from within, various types of insects, non-existent in this world, began to emerge from her wounds, her mouth, her nostrils. As these insects exited Esma’s body, they ate her flesh alive. Nurse Melek screamed and fainted upon seeing the insects. Dr. Fırat, nauseated by the stench, vomited where he stood, after which his vision blackened, and he fainted like Nurse Melek.

As Esma’s body burned fiercely, her soul, unable to bear the pain any longer, prayed for Azrael, the Angel of Death, to come and deliver her from this torment. But she didn’t know that Ahkeran had condemned her soul to this agony for eternity.

Attracted by the smell of burning flesh and dense smoke filling the hospital, staff members rushed into the room. They quickly extinguished Esma’s burning body with fire extinguishers and carried Nurse Melek and Dr. Fırat out of the room to the emergency care.

A day or two later, as Esma’s ashen remains were being buried, her devastated family stood by the grave, waiting for the burial rites to conclude. As the hodja continued reciting the prayer, Esma’s brother cast the first handful of soil onto her. At that very moment, a scream only audible to those in their graves and demonic entities rose up. This scream belonged to Esma.

The Almighty God created jinn and us humans to worship Him. And He separated both realms, forbidding jinn from contacting humans and humans from contacting jinn. If a being from one of these two realms harms another, knowingly or unknowingly, the method of ‘kısasa kısas’ (retribution in kind) is permitted. Therefore, no matter what, do not harm any living being. Otherwise, one day, you will receive retribution for what you have done.",1,1743596336.0,ParanormalHorror,0,1.0,False

Consider this a middle of the week check in. How is everyone holding up? Anything new you're trying this month? What do you have going on today? 

About to head to an appointment, then going to Mudhouse for a coffee before spending the rest of the day at the library. Replanning my budget for the month and going to attempt my first no-spend month 😅

1jpn19j,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jpn19j,"7 Months Post-Op, My journey so far.","I got my surgery on September 2nd. Today marks exactly the 7th month of my journey. When I got measured for my surgery, I came up to 128 kg/282 lbs with a height of 177cm/5 feet 9. My BMI at the time was 40.9, classified as type 3 obesity. Right now, I'm about 85 kg/187 lbs. My BMI is about 27, considered as slightly overweight.

I will tell you about my story in detail, TL;DR: Although it wasn't smooth sailing, I don't regret it one bit.

We humans are oblivious to changes in our body. I think that's because we experience those changes first-hand, gradually. So when you look in the mirror everyday for your entire life, it feels like you have never changed at all. At times like that, it helps to take a step back and look at your previous self. That doesn't always mean it's going to make you feel better, if you are progressing badly, it makes you sad and feel miserable when you look back. I remember to check my pictures from 5-6 months earlier, before I decided for surgery. I thought I looked good in those pictures compared to myself at that time. But same could be said for myself 5-6 months prior. I also thought an earlier version of me was much better than me at that time. That breaks you, makes you feel miserable as you see you have consistently progressed worse.

That all changed when I got my surgery though. I never was someone taking their time to make a decision on anything, which usually ends up with me regretting my decision. I decided to have surgery in just 2 days, and researched the risks etc. for about a week. That was just to ease people around me into my decision though, since I had already accepted everything that comes with this surgery. It ended up being easily one of the two best decisions I had ever made in my life. The other one being dating my girlfriend, which would have probably made this whole journey harder than it was if not for her.

Society doesn't see this surgery as positively as I do. Some think it's a cheat and you are coward for not losing weight in a ""natural"" way. Some think it's risky and they worry about you. That is why I was really afraid to discuss this with my relatives, friends, girlfriend and especially my father. To my surprise, not one of them looked me with the eyes of judgement. They were all supportive, cheering me along my journey. Which is why I consider myself lucky. My loved ones visited me on the day of surgery, both before and after. They helped me walk, watched me puke and crawl in pain. With the help of them, those hard first days passed by quitely and swiftly.

I think the first 2 weeks of the surgery is the hardest physically, and the for a few months after that, hardest for your mental.

Right after surgery, I was in immense pain. This was the first time I was in any kind of surgery so I didn't know what to expect. However, my relatives were prepared as they have backgrounds in medicine and know what to expect. I puked a lot, mainly because of the anesthesia in my system. I had a lot of cramps in my tummy area making me dizzy for 2 days straight. After 2 days, I got sent home and by that point my cramps and puking have all passed. After that, my stitches started to hurt whenever I tried to lie down or stand up straight. I usually stayed in a cramped position and even inclined my bed for ease of sleep, which was really hard to get. After two to four weeks, all your pain goes away and you slowly start to go back to normal. And that's where the mental part begins.

After surgery, your head is filled with just getting better after surgery. You do not think about losing weight or changing your habits etc. But as time passes and your body starts to heal, you starting to feel better, your mind resets to it's normal state. For a month, I have eaten either full liquids or pureed food. Which tasted blend and I really wanted my taste buds to be stimulated in any form. Aside from that need of stimulation, food isn't really an issue at the beginning. I did not get hungry, I did not crave food just for the sake of it and even if I did, I would get full with just a couple spoons.

As time goes on, you also start to return back to your regular old social life, as restrictions on your foods and drinks slowly lift up. That's when I started to think I will never have as much fun taking a coffee or out eating with my friends or my girlfriend. I cried a lot ""realizing"" that. I am a social butterfly and I really hate being by myself. So this change really broke me to pieces. But human mentality is a real piece of art. It adjusts to both it's surroundings and to you, so much so that you would be surprised to see how many stuff you ""can"" be okay with given enough time. I did not have much problem socializing until one day, me and a couple of friends decided to barbecue for the weekend. I forgot that I now had a really small stomach, ate too much and puked for the first time. Not really a deal breaking experience as I have back with my friends in a few minutes. But that made me realize I in fact was not like rest of the people anymore, although not much different, I needed to adjust my life to the changes I went through. 

Realizing that marks the beginning of the end of your journey in my opinion. After that, you start to normalize your food portions, try to avoid certain foods (in my case fried chicken really was taking toll on me) and drinks. You begin to not measure everything, not care about anything and just have a healthy mindset. Craving some sweets? Yeah sure, but I instinctively knew when to stop at this time around. I began to see what I've once thought of downsides as bonuses. For example, not being able to eat too much seemed like a social tradeoff but now I see it as a financial advantage. When I'm out with friends, I either get the smallest item (which usually is cheaper) or just don't order at all and just take one or two bites off my friends' foods making me feel full without making them feel like fool. Or when I'm out with my girlfriend-whom also don't eat too much food- we order just one portion and eat it together. That in my opinion makes our dinner dates much more fun, romantic and inevitebly economic. 

As I have lost about 43 kg/95 lbs, I'm nearing the end of my weight loss journey. I expect to lose the last weights in 2-3 months as my pace have been pretty good. After that I believe my next journey starts, to keep those weights off, implementing a healthy and active life style and just being positive.

For anyone going through harsh times with this surgery, I wish you luck and would like to let you know that everything DOES get better if you put your heart to it. With much love.
