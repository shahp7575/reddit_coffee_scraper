Hello guys, just wanna share to you all my story and would like to have an advice too.

Im 28f filipina girl currently working in Kuwait as an OFW, Ive been here for more than 2 years now, the country is actually i might say boring and sad but I was able to manage it all because in those 2 years I was with a LDR with my boyfriend who is filipino too and hes in the Philippines, everything was great between us but later on I lost feeling because I feel like were both busy and I feel like I was the man in the relationship, im 7 years older than him. So we decided to broke up July of this year, feeling alone and lonely cuz obviously I cant stand being alone I installed a dating app to just distract from the break up. I talk to some guys mostly indians and local kuwaitis too, the first guy that Ive meet was a good guy but there was no chemistry at all and was mostly friendship and we only drink coffee at a cafe nearby my place and call it a day. Next guy was a kuwaiti, well call him JK, hes profile said hes 27 and all in all a good looking guy, so we met september 11, and from the get go I was already attracted to him, He was fun and looks young than in pictures, so he pick me up from my place and it was already 11pm at that time since i got off from work 10 pm, so we get some food and he ask where do we go and since im actually quite shy and I really dont know any place in Kuwait I let him lead, but at that night I wasnt planning on being intimate, he asked me then if I would like to chill at his place and my stupid self said yes, got in in his apartment very sneakily because hes older brother is in next apartment. So I was definitely enjoying his presence he talks and share things about him and hes very attractive and smells nice too, and the thing happened I was the one who kiss him first and we had sex, I slept there he was still sweet the morning after and brought me home. He reached out ask him to be his girl and I said yes, everything was fine the first week, I might say he lovebomb me promising me things like going to salon, buying me crocs watch movies and all those stuff couples do and saying he loves me thats hes happy for having me and all those sweet talks, and i admittedly believe all of it cuz in person i can feel that he cares. we text each other and calls at night too.

By next couple of weeks I started to feel him slowly pulling away, sometimes he left me on read, the text lessen and I also started asking if we can hangout outside not just at his place and he still assured me that we will. I developed anxiety because of him cuz i felt like the things that he did from the start is slowly fading away. and on top of that whenever we are together I can sense him being sad and also at start he doesnt want me to know hes last name or even his social media accounts, we talk in snap and whatsapp. I turned a blind eye to all those redflags and I started questioning myself if maybe I am the problem too maybe I wont ask too much but I know that Im not asking fro too much, never asked for money or any material things at all he never gave me anything at all, I just wanted to do normal couples do like going outside watch movies cuz he was always the one suggested that, I know as well that sometimes I havd redflag too like one time I ask if well break up or telling him that we wont last its becux for me its a defense mechanism foe him to act on his words.

Eventually we stop hanging out at his place because his brother found out about us and text me thru snap and i replied bcux at that time we didnt talk for 2 days cuz he left me on read again, that was the 2nd time. hes brother started asking question and i stupidly answered bcuz he was being nice. and i told JK about it in the morning and he was mad at me , after that he suggested for us to get an apartment of my own so he can visit me from time to time, at that point I was feeling happy because atleast he still finds a way for us to see each other, but then again, the hot and cold surface once more. when we are together i know his happy althoug i feel like hes going thru something internally with family problems cux his parents are divorced and he lives alone for how many years, I thought my love would be enough for him you know. i thought to myself ill take care of him, that I can be his family and he will never feel alone again, boy was i wrong.

I can slowly feel him pulling away and we broke up and the next day got back together cuz i texted him and persuaded him to try again, I was madly inlove with him. I dont even know why tbh sometimes I feel that Im only infatuated or attach but I never felt any of this with someone before and the sex too for me was great. In order to save our relationship, I frantically look for an apartment call anyone check on fb market look for furnitures, and then we found one. we are already over a month of being together at this point. I am about to move in paid the deposit and all and 2 days before he bailed out, told me that hes mom and uncle will come here in Kuwait from saudi and we needs to go to saudi too, telling me that he might be arranged in a marriage, that hes sick, his mom has cancer, his grandmother too, all those excuses and u didnt even know if those were all lies. I Cried talking to him like my emotions are all over the place cuz I know whats coming and I know I cant save it anymore, he didnt promise me anything but its still hurt, cuz he couldve been honest with me. The day after he told me that he was still saying for me to calm down and he wrill try to postone and that he will still stya with me we dont need to moved in yet, telling me I was the first thing on his mind.

We met each other for the last stime a week ago cuz I wanted clarifications and to ask him were we stand and i didnt get any closure from him cux he basically force me to have sex with him and I gave in affter push and pulling, the happy guy I know slowly dissapeared and I see this man as he is. now i felt used and blindsided left with questions that will never be answred after i lfet the car he still texted me that we will pass this together and i replied goodnight and since then we ddint text each other for 5 days, I reach on the 25th broke NC becuz of the payment he need to trasnfer to me and also i miss him, i know u can call me stupid but I basically still chase him and pleaded with him to get back together and he refused. i felt awful he didnt wnt to talk even for few minutes at all, and just told me that he was sorry and he doesnt know if he was happy or just miserable and telling me that i will only end up miserable too cux his life is chaotic and that he is a hateful spiteful person and he wanted to love and cherish me but he couldnt. he told me once that he never let someone else in and I know that hes not mentally well and like dismissive avoidant im not really sure. it felt like hes not the guy i first met like hes detach already

so now im left wondering what to do, im so broken felt used wondering if did he ever loved me or liked me or he only played me, or his parents found out and pressured him cux he told me he will be deserted, I dont really know he never told me the exact reason why, he knows that im alone here in Kuwait i dont go out that much always work home set up and now i feel depressed, didnt eat for 2 days, everythings messy lose weight and got no motivation anymore, he told me that he already left kuwait and not sure if he will be back. and my vacation is gonna be on nov 1, 4 days from now.

and im thinking a. I should try to move on go to a gym, join a club and forget about him but the delulu part of me will always think that if im still here i will still hope that someday we will reach out because im delusional \\

b. go home and spend my 1 month vacation to freshen up but financially unprepared becuz this is not planned at all and i might cry again if ill come back here after the vaction is over.

c. go home for good and leave everything behind, since I have enough savings and start my own business

and tbh i wanted to go home, i just cant find enough reason for me to stay in this place anymore. my family knows and they are supportive of me going home, i jjst dont know maybe ill regret in one day and i maybe its impulsive.

please any advice will do, and criticism is fine cuz I know i did act stupid",1,1730045472.0,Bumble,0,1.0,False
1gdeg9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1gdeg9x/thoughts_of_kms_has_been_bothering_me/,Thoughts of kms has been bothering me.,"Note:- this is a rant, so its gonna be long and There will be no TLDR.

Hi, my name is yash, 19, some of you might know me from a year ago, coz i made a post about how i was facing excessive hairfall, now i really dont care about it, coz im in the worst mental state rn. So the title is right, i have been somewhat depressed form a long time, but i used to think that ""depression"" is temperory and i am a strong mf, but now, i am having sucidial tendencies. I searched for free online therapy, but i couldnt find one, so i just wanna know how can i cope up with this. I have my CA intermediate exams in january, but i really dont feel like studying. The only dopamine source for me is GYM, maybe because i like pain, i know it may sound cliche,but this is real. I punch walls, and this gives me boost, i nearly died 2 days ago because i was rash driving (\~100kms on a bike). I dont want to talk to people, im thinking of switching to a keypad phone, so that i wont use whatsapp. I have stopped using social media, and i hate instagram. Im addictied to caffeine, i drink 3-4 cups of black coffee and 4 caffeine pills (400mg caffeine). I hate my house, the way i wake up, i sleep around 8hrs, but everyday i wake up, its the same feeling of why i woke up. Life is monotonous, 8:30am to 11:00 am gym, 1:00 pm to 9:00 pm library, where i study for about 4hrs, and the remaining is just media consumption about various topics. As i told above i have stopped using instagram, so dont consume any short form content. I just want someone to talk about this stuff, cant talk about this with my parents because theyll just say its black magic n all, i have shared this stuff with my only friend but he just cant do anything, plus he also have his own problems. So thats it, maybe i couldnt put it to words perfectly, but you guys just got the stuff. Can i find someone to talk this stuff anonymously? And if you have come this far, thanks for reading this, you may not help me, but sharing this have made me feel good.

Hello guys, just wanna share to you all my story and would like to have an advice too.

Im 28f filipina girl currently working in Kuwait as an OFW, Ive been here for more than 2 years now, the country is actually i might say boring and sad but I was able to manage it all because in those 2 years I was with a LDR with my boyfriend who is filipino too and hes in the Philippines, everything was great between us but later on I lost feeling because I feel like were both busy and I feel like I was the man in the relationship, im 7 years older than him.

I talk to some guys mostly indians and local kuwaitis too, the first guy that Ive meet was a good guy but there was no chemistry at all and was mostly friendship and we only drink coffee at a cafe nearby my place and call it a day. Next guy was a kuwaiti, well call him JK, hes profile said hes 27 and all in all a good looking guy, so we met september 11, and from the get go I was already attracted to him, He was fun and looks young than in pictures, so he pick me up from my place and it was already 11pm at that time since i got off from work 10 pm, so we get some food and he ask where do we go and since im actually quite shy and I really dont know any place in Kuwait I let him lead, but at that night I wasnt planning on being intimate, he asked me then if I would like to chill at his place and my stupid self said yes, got in in his apartment very sneakily because hes older brother is in next apartment.

He reached out ask him to be his girl and I said yes, everything was fine the first week, I might say he lovebomb me promising me things like going to salon, buying me crocs watch movies and all those stuff couples do and saying he loves me thats hes happy for having me and all those sweet talks, and i admittedly believe all of it cuz in person i can feel that he cares. we text each other and calls at night too.

By next couple of weeks I started to feel him slowly pulling away, sometimes he left me on read, the text lessen and I also started asking if we can hangout outside not just at his place and he still assured me that we will. I developed anxiety because of him cuz i felt like the things that he did from the start is slowly fading away. and on top of that whenever we are together I can sense him being sad and also at start he doesnt want me to know hes last name or even his social media accounts, we talk in snap and whatsapp. I turned a blind eye to all those redflags and I started questioning myself if maybe I am the problem too maybe I wont ask too much but I know that Im not asking fro too much, never asked for money or any material things at all he never gave me anything at all, I just wanted to do normal couples do like going outside watch movies cuz he was always the one suggested that, I know as well that sometimes I havd redflag too like one time I ask if well break up or telling him that we wont last its becux for me its a defense mechanism foe him to act on his words.

Eventually we stop hanging out at his place because his brother found out about us and text me thru snap and i replied bcux at that time we didnt talk for 2 days cuz he left me on read again, that was the 2nd time. hes brother started asking question and i stupidly answered bcuz he was being nice. and i told JK about it in the morning and he was mad at me , after that he suggested for us to get an apartment of my own so he can visit me from time to time, at that point I was feeling happy because atleast he still finds a way for us to see each other, but then again, the hot and cold surface once more. when we are together i know his happy althoug i feel like hes going thru something internally with family problems cux his parents are divorced and he lives alone for how many years, I thought my love would be enough for him you know. i thought to myself ill take care of him, that I can be his family and he will never feel alone again, boy was i wrong.

I can slowly feel him pulling away and we broke up and the next day got back together cuz i texted him and persuaded him to try again, I was madly inlove with him. I dont even know why tbh sometimes I feel that Im only infatuated or attach but I never felt any of this with someone before and the sex too for me was great. In order to save our relationship, I frantically look for an apartment call anyone check on fb market look for furnitures, and then we found one. we are already over a month of being together at this point. I am about to move in paid the deposit and all and 2 days before he bailed out, told me that hes mom and uncle will come here in Kuwait from saudi and we needs to go to saudi too, telling me that he might be arranged in a marriage, that hes sick, his mom has cancer, his grandmother too, all those excuses and u didnt even know if those were all lies. I Cried talking to him like my emotions are all over the place cuz I know whats coming and I know I cant save it anymore, he didnt promise me anything but its still hurt, cuz he couldve been honest with me. The day after he told me that he was still saying for me to calm down and he wrill try to postone and that he will still stya with me we dont need to moved in yet, telling me I was the first thing on his mind.

We met each other for the last stime a week ago cuz I wanted clarifications and to ask him were we stand and i didnt get any closure from him cux he basically force me to have sex with him and I gave in affter push and pulling, the happy guy I know slowly dissapeared and I see this man as he is. now i felt used and blindsided left with questions that will never be answred after i lfet the car he still texted me that we will pass this together and i replied goodnight and since then we ddint text each other for 5 days, I reach on the 25th broke NC becuz of the payment he need to trasnfer to me and also i miss him, i know u can call me stupid but I basically still chase him and pleaded with him to get back together and he refused. i felt awful he didnt wnt to talk even for few minutes at all, and just told me that he was sorry and he doesnt know if he was happy or just miserable and telling me that i will only end up miserable too cux his life is chaotic and that he is a hateful spiteful person and he wanted to love and cherish me but he couldnt. he told me once that he never let someone else in and I know that hes not mentally well and like dismissive avoidant im not really sure. it felt like hes not the guy i first met like hes detach already

so now im left wondering what to do, im so broken felt used wondering if did he ever loved me or liked me or he only played me, or his parents found out and pressured him cux he told me he will be deserted, I dont really know he never told me the exact reason why, he knows that im alone here in Kuwait i dont go out that much always work home set up and now i feel depressed, didnt eat for 2 days, everythings messy lose weight and got no motivation anymore, he told me that he already left kuwait and not sure if he will be back. and my vacation is gonna be on nov 1, 4 days from now.

and im thinking a. I should try to move on go to a gym, join a club and forget about him but the delulu part of me will always think that if im still here i will still hope that someday we will reach out because im delusional \\

b. go home and spend my 1 month vacation to freshen up but financially unprepared becuz this is not planned at all and i might cry again if ill come back here after the vaction is over.

c. go home for good and leave everything behind, since I have enough savings and start my own business

and tbh i wanted to go home, i just cant find enough reason for me to stay in this place anymore. my family knows and they are supportive of me going home, i jjst dont know maybe ill regret in one day and i maybe its impulsive.

please any advice will do, and criticism is fine cuz I know i did act stupid",1,1730045370.0,exmuslim,1,1.0,False

But average middle class guys interests will mostly be confined to sports, movies, bike riding etc. Meanwhile women from same background have these elite hobbies. Most of the time the people who are most interested in attending concertd through bookmyshow, or going to bookstores, attending book clubs, artisanal roast coffee places tend to be educated women. What's going on ? Even in terms of movies and shows, women tend to consume a lot more Netflix and other content and stay updated about all this.

The end result is an average woman from educated class has more well rounded personality than average man from same background and has way more conversation topics. What's going on ?

I will be heading to the canyon soon. 1st time hiking anything significant in the canyon. I have 2 nights at bright angel. I am aware of the bright angel closure. My plan is to hike to BA first  night and second night day hike around, maybe up the north rim and/ or ribbon falls. Then back to BA campground and out the next day via the Tonto trail to Bright Angel. I am a 50 ish year old trail runner (no ultras lately) but I run/ climb hills every other day up to 10 miles and recently completed a 14 mile steep elevation hike to 10,4000  with 4500+ feet of elevation gain as well as some overnight backpacking in the eastern sierras. Anyway, I don't care if I complete rim to rim to rim, I just want to enjoy the experience and maybe hike some of the trail. I don't need to get to the top. Trying to figure out trail distances. Does anyone know how long is the hike out from Bright Angel campground using the tonto trail to bright angel? I am keeping my pack as light as possible/ 25 pounds.  thinking of ditching the stove/ propane since I can get coffee and a meal at phantom ranch. Also are you able pay for a meal once you are at phantom ranch in cash or is a reservation absolutely needed? Weather is in the 40s/ low so considering bringing my 30 degree bag and liner versus my zero bag? I will have wool layers for sleeping. Thanks everyone! ",1,1730045305.0,grandcanyon,0,1.0,False

I've been on online dating sites for 3 months. I'm not a particularly good-looking man, relatively short (5'7) and in my early 30s. But I have a surprisingly ""lot"" of matches (around 700 in the last 3 months on all platforms). Been on countless dates. Every time I wanted something more, I was rejected. I just hurt and feel like shit. In the last few weeks I have received several such long texts with “I have thought about this for a long time”. I have no idea what I'm doing wrong.

 

Usually: Meet for a coffee, talk a bit, walk a bit. Women are often willing to do a little more than planned. Then we say goodbye, actually always with “I would be happy to see you again”. Then write later that I thought the meeting was nice and that I hope she got home safely. Then the next day I write something like a nice day or an anecdote about yesterday. not pushy or anything like that...yes, then mostly this message

1gdebzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheIndianMethod/comments/1gdebzp/why_your_next_superhero_duo_should_be_outsourcing/,Why Your Next Superhero Duo Should Be Outsourcing and AI,"Imagine discovering a productivity hack that lets you reclaim your weekends from endless spreadsheets and emails! Picture the majestic combo of outsourcing and AI. It's like Batman teaming up with Ironman – yes, I know they’re from different universes, but just roll with this multiverse magic.

Outsourcing is like hiring a superhero team from around the globe, minus the capes but with all the skills. Need someone to handle customer service at 3 AM while you dream about your next vacation? There's a VA in another time zone who loves taking your calls before you've even hit your morning coffee. It's a win-win – they get a job, you get some much-needed shut-eye.

Now, add the AI component – your new age butler who never sleeps or asks for a raise. AI can sort emails faster than you can say 'discount offers gone!', schedule social media posts better than your Instagram-savvy niece, and give you real-time analytics that make you look like a business guru in meetings.

The best part? Combining outsourcing and AI doesn’t just save you cash – it's like building a time machine that gifts you extra hours every day. More time to work on that office ping-pong tournament, jump into a new hobby, or, heck, even learn how to make TikToks!

Together, outsourcing and AI make an unstoppable duo that lets you focus on growing your business with the flexibility of a yoga instructor and the cost efficiency of a thrift store shopping spree. What’s not to love? Let’s hear it for the unsung superheroes behind the scenes, never wearing capes, yet always saving the day in style!",1,1730045082.0,TheIndianMethod,0,1.0,False
1gdebwm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameideas/comments/1gdebwm/the_stillroom_stardewesc_storekeepingstory_driven/,"The StillRoom: Stardew-esc storekeeping/story driven game. Craft & sell your own speciality goods at your storefront using ingredients from your small farm, forage the forest, and trading with locals.","A stillroom is a seperate room/building from the main house, used back in the day on large properties that had tons of usable land. The housekeeper would use the land's gardens, local ingredients in nature or in town to produce and store a number of different products for the owners of the property. Soaps, tonics, liqueurs, preserves, jams, cakes, dried herbs, coffees, teas, wine, etc. were often made in these stillrooms by the housekeep to give the owners their own goods to use by the very ingredients they grow on their land.

The plot of the game is similar to Stardew valley, where you get ahold of an abandoned stillroom with a storefront that has a small but high potential farmland in the back, located in a small town hidden between other farmlands and bigger towns in the area. The town you're homed in is struggling to get enough visitors to sustain its local businesses and you are going to take part in bringing life back into the place. You'll not only help the locals with the everyday struggles they face, but soon discover a forest with their own inhabitants in need of help, all encircling the old mansion of someone long passed who once owned all this land, including the very stillroom you now own just outside the forest bounds.

**STORE KEEPING**

You aren't a grocer, or the local convenience store. You are a speciality shop that takes low value products like fresh veggies, fruits, simple cheeses, and what not to turn them into high value goods that you'll need to manage at every step of the process.

Your focus at the stillroom is picking out what kind of goods you want to sell at your storefront, utilizing the limited space you have to produce high value goods beyond the normal items the locals get from their grocer or convinince store.

The variety of products you could sell would extend to medicinal tonics, natural cosmetics, canned goods (jams, preserves, pickles and ferments), liquers/liqours and fortified/spices wines, dried herbs and spices, certain baked goods and more. At first you'd have to focus on a set number of products in order to run things smoothly, but you'll be able to expand your operations as the game goes on. The best approach would not to try to create every item in game, rather specialize in set of items you can master crafting. If you want to try to dive into every craft, you can do so but it will be very difficult to manage and take alot more time to become rewarding.

The locals in the town will begin to have expectations of your store based on the direction you take it, and will be more willing to buy higher tiered items as they begin to trust your service. This will give you a way to gradually make more money at time goes on.

**THE STILLROOM**

You can experiment with a number of items at your disposal to create any variety of products you'd like. The value of these products will rely on a few factors: natural cohesion between certain products (flowers always highly enhances soaps, sweet spices like nutmeg, allspice and cinnomin enhance jams, etc.), the overall value of the products you use, and the quality of its production. You will never be penalized for creating a product with out-of-ordinary enhancements, but you can screw up recipes during its processing phase. Putting too much sugar in a jam or burning it as it cooks on the stove. Over distilling alcohols making them bitter. Not properly canning your jars. You can ruin an entire batch of items if you aren't careful, wasting your time and money.

That being said, certain weird combinations like rosemary and raspberry jam can trigger a customer loving the product and will pay more money for your continued production of it. Infact, news of this unique product will spread and you will get a surge of customers coming in to buy that specific good. This could last a week, 2 weeks, a month, or months! You could end up being known for selling this unique product, it's up to you if you want to capitalize on it. Though be warned, it may go out of trend at some point, so pay attention to it's sales numbers.

The stillroom will only have a certain amount of space in its basement, or have limited equipment to work with. You will be able to upgrade and buy new equipment as you progress the game. This is the same for the storefront, your garden, and your cottage out back as well. Everything can be upgraded and even highly decorated. You'll work with your local carpenter to help build up your property.

Management of your production/storage will be a big part of the game. Preservation will be very important, as you'll need to be sure all your products are in optimal containment or pulled at right times so you don't end up ruining all the work you've invested in. Checking on ferments happening in the basement, being sure bottled goods aren't sitting on the shelves too long to avoid light damage, dealing with the excess goat cheese you've purchased by either curing it or stack your shelves full of it and hoping they sell before the expiration date. You'll need to keep an eye on your products so you don't end up wasting all that time and money you've put in.

You can apply many different methods to help aid this management, with varying degrees of effort needed, products changed, and difficulty storing. EX: Curing soft cheeses elongate their life spans, but make them less desirable to customers. Adding emulsifiers to your soaps can help save a batch after improperly making it, but customers don't like the residue these emulsifiers leave behind. Purchasing aluminum canning lids instead of flimsy tin lids lessen the chance of improperly canned goods, tinted bottles instead of clear protect products from light damage, wax paper protect soaps from drying out compared to cloth you used to wrap it in.

**THE FOREST**

A big part of the game will be exploring the large forest behind the town, holding a collection of caves, ponds, rivers, and more that you will spend a considerable amount of time scavenging for goods like mushrooms, wild herbs you could collect and take back to your farm, wild vegetables, truffles, fish/shellfish, and more. Parts of it will always be the same floorplan, so you may create a map of bee hives, areas you know will have mushroom clusters, nut trees, ect. While areas you walk into like ponds, caves, and swamps could be randomly generated each time you enter them.

The plot of this part of the game is the forest is inhabited by different kinds of mythical creatures who are in termoil with one another for a variety of reasons. For this upset among them and to avoid even more powerful/evil forces within, a collection of forest fairies are placing pockets of magical influence that push the area into a state of hiding. This magical influence has been the immediate cause of the towns decline as it's push outsiders to become forgetful of the town or not notice it all together.

The focal point of these endeavours are focused on the mansion that sits in the center of the forest, as you come to find out once belonged to your great great grandfather long ago. For some reason it has harbered evil entitites for a while and it will became a location you'll have to visit often, discovering your ancestor's past and their long-term affect on this town as a whole.

In order for you to help these fairies and other creatures of the forest, you will need to forage for both regular and magical ingredients to create concoctions in your stillroom that will aid you and necessary to combat the evil that lurks within. Combat, exploration, puzzles, and decision making will be apart of these adventures you'll take on.

This will introduce you to new locations in the forest, discover new varieties of produce, and give you the opportunity to forage for new items. As you continue on these adventures, the mythical creatures will begin to rid of the forest of its magical protection, giving you and the town an opportunity to grow back into the thriving community it once was.

**FARMING**

Your farm itself is only capable of growing small amounts of high value products like peppers, herbs, spices, flowers, fruit trees/bushes, root vegetables (garlic, ginger, tumeric) ECT that all take specific care to maintain. As you progress the game, you will get a hold of differents seeds that expand the kind of produce you can grow, as well as give you higher tiers of a type of produce. EX: Getting an Italian Oregano over Greek, boosting its value increase on tomato based products. A new apple tree sapling that produces sweeter apples than you have currently.

You would not have enough space to say, produce enough grapes for wine making, or enough wheat for flour. The limited space on your property means you are only able to produce a set number of things on your own.

**TRADING**

In order to widen your variety, you have to take part in trading with the local businesses in your area that sell their own specific products. This would play an important part in the economics of your game where you'll have to spend money purchasing goods from these businesses and use their stock to create even higher value goods to sell for more money.

Winery: Wine to cook with, create mulled wine, distill to make brandy, make wine vinegar, or buy their left over grape pomace to make brandy or medicinal products.

Wheat farmer:  To buy flour from and make assorted baked goods.

Olive oil mill: To produce flavored olive oil, cook with, create cosmetics with.

Dairy Rancher: Dairy to cook with or flavor soft cheeses with herbs and spices.

This would go on with the bee keeper, local farmer, butcher, and more. Missions will be available for these NPCs and you will grow a relationship with them that gives you access to higher quality goods they will sell to you.

**FARMERS MARKET**

Once a week your shop will be closed and instead a farmers market will be happening at the biggest town in the area. You will be able to travel to this town and set up your own stand at this market, selling any goods you have at a much higher price than you'd be able to at your own store. Not only will you make a boost of income from this event, but you will entice other people at the market to visit your hometown, not only helping it's economy but increase the number of customers you get at your storefront throughout the week.

At the same time, other businesses you've not met already will be at the farmers market, selling high value goods you yourself will be able to buy. Tea, coffee, fish/shellfish, rare produce, and more. They are expensive but will yield high income if you successfully process them into your own high value products. This is a risky investment, as people will be more picky on how you change these products, so it might be better to play it safe at first until you have enough income to mess around with recipes more.

If you build a relation with these sellers through their own missions and buying their goods, you'll be able to get them to ship their products to your place at a discounted price anytime of the week.

**TOWNSPEOPLE, RELATIONSHIPS, MISSIONS**

Just like Stardew Valley, you'll be able to build a relationship with the people of your town and take on missions provided to you. Whether it's supplying goods for events happening around, building up a love interest with a local, or solving issues for the local businesses, you'll help the town grow out of its slump and help it become a beacon of community for everyone to visit.

You can also take the opportunity to befriend certain businesses like the bakery, who can buy bulk orders of your jams that they will sell along side their bread, or the convenience store buying bulk of your cosmetics and natural soaps/lotions. This is an easy money maker as you can gain a big chunk of income right away, instead of waiting to sell your stock at your own store.

1gdeafz,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/coffee-note-brew-taste/id6447321924,Coffee Note - Your Personal Coffee Tasting Journal ☕,"Hey everyone! 🙋‍♂️ I’m Kuba, the developer of Coffee Note, an app I created to help coffee enthusiasts like myself keep track of their coffee experiences in an easy, organized way.

If you’re anything like me, you love trying different beans, brewing methods, and roasts. Sometimes you lose track of how much caffeine you consume and after a while, it’s easy to forget what you liked about that one specific cup of coffee from last week (or was it last month?). That’s where Coffee Note comes in.

Coffee Note allows you to log your tasting notes, rate your brews, and track everything from flavor profiles to brewing methods, all in one app. Whether you’re trying to perfect your pour-over or just want to remember which beans had that awesome citrus note, Coffee Note has you covered.

Here’s a quick rundown of what Coffee Note offers:

* **Customizable Tasting Logs**: Record the specifics of each coffee you try—bean origin, roast, brewing method, flavors, and more.
* **Caffeine Tracker**: Track how much caffeine you consume also with a glanceable widget.
* **Star Ratings**: Give your coffee a rating so you can easily remember which ones stood out.
* **Brew Method History**: Keep track of the brewing methods you’ve used, and how they affect the flavor of your coffee.
* **Simple, Clean Interface**: Coffee Note was designed to be easy to use, with a clean layout that lets you focus on your coffee experiences, not the app itself.

As someone who loves coffee, I built this app to solve a problem I had myself. It’s available for free, and if you’re ready to go premium it’s a one-time purchase of $19.99—no subscriptions or hidden fees, or if you prefer subscriptions opt for monthly or annual plans. Just one app to enhance your coffee journey.

I’d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, and any questions you might have. Feel free to ask here, or check out kubamilcarz.com/coffeeNote for more info!

Thanks for reading, and happy brewing!

1gde9ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gde9ld/i_found_out_the_secret_of_the_weirdest_man_in_my/,I found out the secret of the weirdest man in my hometown. It was worse that I could've imagined.,"He turned up around six months ago. It was us students who noticed him first since everyday he'd walk past the town's high-school at around the same time. The kids would be out in the yard, playing basketball and gossiping, would stop what they were doing to watch hum stroll by. He never looked at us, but by God did we make a game out of looking at him.

What got everyone was how he dressed. He didn't show a speck of skin. His entire body was covered with some piece of clothing. It looked like a kid who'd gotten into their parents closet. Everything he wore was mismatched and tattered. Usually it'd be a long, brown duster coat, tartan slacks and a horribly stained shirt. Occasionally he'd throw in a scarf or a hat, or maybe a second coat under the duster. He wore gloves, sometimes leather, sometimes silk, and a tweed mask. 

His mask was hard to explain. It wrapped around his head perfectly with no visible seams or eye holes. We didn't know whether he could see or not, but he never had any trouble walking or crossing the road. I think it's the mask that really got people's imagination wearing. 

Some of the kids guessed he might have a rare skin disease. Others thought that he might've been a worker at the old chemical plant and was badly burned when the factory burnt down, but that would've made him at least ninety years old. A bunch of older kids spread the rumour that he was some sick serial killer, laying low in our sleepy town, covering his face in case someone recognises him from a wanted poster or breaking news bulletin. Everyone liked to propound from the sidelines, but no one had the guts to actually find out. Not until tonight.

It was the 26th of October. School had just ended for a week-long break and I was going to my first real party. I barely knew the guy whose house it was at, but I leapt at the chance of underage drinking. 

The night turned out great. We all had fun and managed to not throw up once. I downed a whole packet of apple-flavoured chewing gum to try and mask the smell of alcohol on my breath from my parents, although I had a feeling they'd be able to tell anyway. Me and three close friends left the party just before eleven and set off staggering home. 

We passed my friend Luke's house first. As he walked up to his front door a light came on and his mother stepped out, her face contorted with pure anger. We laughed at Luke and stumbled on our way as he realised he mixed up the dates and forgot to tell his parents he was going out tonight.

Me, Shayne and Rowan kept messing around as we navigated our way back home. Shayne's house was next and since I lived so far out, I was planning on having a sleepover at Rowan's. We turned a corner, still laughing from a joke we made a block ago, and saw someone. All three of us crouched behind the fence, peeping out from behind to confirm our suspicions. Walking down the middle of the road was the Masked Man.

He was in his usual get up, only he'd taken off his gloves. We all squinted to try and get a better look. The only light we had came from a pathetic, constantly buzzing street lamp but we were desperate to finally see what he's been hiding. All of a sudden he turned and began walking up to a house. He stepped up onto the porch and opened the door. Just as he walked inside, we could see him slowly take off his mask, and then the door slammed shut behind him. 

The three of us looked at each other, all thinking the same thing. The mystery of what the Masked Man looked like was still that - a mystery. He had his back to us and even in perfect daylight we wouldn't have been able to make his face out. The first one of us to commit our thoughts to speech was Shayne. 

He told us, pumping out his chest, that he was gonna go see which of the rumours was true. He said he had a plan and before me or Rowan could say anything, Shayne was already halfway across the street. We looked at each other and followed him, coming up to the Masked Man's old house. It was noticeably more run down than the other houses on the block. The paint was peeling, the gutter had almost fallen down and an upstairs window had been shattered. The three of us stood around the front door, keeping our voices low as Shayne explained his grand plan. 

He said he was going to simply knock on the front door. When the Masked Man answered, he'd say “oh sorry, wrong house” and then just turn around and leave, but not before getting a good eyeful of him. We all thought that it was a flawless plan and egged him on as we took our hiding place behind a bush at the end of the Masked Man's property. 

As I got a good look at the house I realised that I recognised it. My dad had this friend who had gone through a rough divorce. He slept in our spare room for a few weeks before he eventually won the house back in the court settlement. Around six months ago, he moved out of town without so much as a goodbye. I could remember when I was much younger him showing his car off to me. That thing was his pride and joy. I couldn't believe this was the same house. 

My thoughts were bisected by the sound of Shayne rapping his knuckles on the front door. He turned to look at us and gave us a dumb grin and a thumbs up. I think he was about to crack a joke when the door opened. Standing at the entrance was the Masked Man. He'd taken off his mask, as well as most of his clothes. That much I could make out as he was still shrouded in shadows. There wasn't a single light on in his house and to me and Rowan he wasn't anything more than a silhouette.

As we both tried to discreetly get a better look, Shayne began stuttering out his excuse. Suddenly, he stopped. There was a pause before he began to scream in a shrill pitch. We watched as the Masked Man grabbed Shayne by his lower jaw and violently yanked him inside the house, the door slamming shut behind him.
 
Me and Rowan looked on in shock. I turned to Rowan to ask him what we should do but before I could speak he was up and running to the front door. He started pounding on it and yelling expletives. I ran up behind him and yanked him away. I held him and asked if he was crazy. As he began mumbling a response, the front door began to open. 

We both bolted like a greyhound out of a trap and dived behind the corner of the house. We stayed there, holding our breath and waiting to meet the same fate as Shayne. Eventually, Rowan found enough courage to peep around the edge of the wall. He didn't see anyone. He moved out a little further and saw that the door was still closed. 

I pulled him back and told him that we should call the police. He snorted and explained to me that they'd probably arrest us for underage drinking. We'd spend the night in some jail cell and by the time we could explain ourselves, Shayne would be dead. 

Before I could question his reasoning, Rowan walked over to a window, cupped his hands and peeked in. I sighed, frustrated, and asked if he saw anything. He was replying with a long, drawn-out “no” when suddenly he yelped and crouched down. Seeing his reaction I instinctively did the same. 

I crawled over to him and in a voice just below a whisper I asked him what he'd seen. I could see the fear in his eyes as he told me that saw the Mask Man, now mostly derobed, walking out from what he guessed was a door to the basement. After that, Rowan started muttering to himself about how the Masked Man must've seen him. 

I knew that Shayne, my best friend for as long as I could remember, was in the basement. My stomach churned thinking about what I had to do next. I held my breath as I stood and peered in through the window. I couldn't see the Masked Man anywhere. I nudged the window and my suspensions were confirmed. Like the front door, the window was left unlocked and slightly ajar. 

I tried to steady my breath as I pulled the window all the way open. Rowan looked at me in shock as I asked him to give me a leg up. Still, he complied. Once I was inside I pulled him in after me. Before I did, he grabbed a fist sized rock from the garden. “For self defence”, he told me. 

The house was perfectly still. Every surface was covered in a thin veneer of dust. We both stood there for a second, trying to hear the Masked Man. There wasn't a sound, other than the faint dripping of some faraway faucet. In what we thought was relative safety, we crept our way to the door the Masked Man had emerged from. I gently opened it and sure enough, I was met with a staircase descending into the impenetrable darkness of the basement. 

I didn't dare call out Shayne's name in fear that he wouldn't be the only one who'd hear me. Instead, I began my way down the stairs, Rowan following right behind me. My mother had given me a small wind-up torch, so I could make my way home safely at night, she said. I fished around in my coat pocket for it, my hand clutching the familiar metal just as I reached the bottom.I found the button and switched it on, finally illuminating the room. It took me a while to realise what I was seeing, but judging from Rowan's deafening scream, he knew right away. 

Shayne was hanging upside down from the ceiling, a chained hook driven through both of his ankles. He had long, fresh cuts across his throat, wrists and legs, which were all pouring with blood. The blood dripped down into a series of angled metal sheeting, which directed the flow into a steel trough. There were four other bodies hanging from chains, all serving the same purpose. Some looked like they'd been there for weeks. We both turned and ran. As we scrambled back up the stairs my torch beam fell on the figure standing motionless in the doorway. 

We slowly stepped back down the stairs until we were at the bottom again. We froze, watching for any sign of movement. Suddenly, the figure began to lift slowly off the ground. In an instant, it shot down the stairs, flying through the air like it had been thrown. I dived out of the way but Rowan wasn't as lucky. The thing piled into him and pinned him to the ground. As I got to my feet, I saw it run its black, claw-like fingernails across his neck. 

I screamed and the Masked Man turned to look at me. It lifted itself to its feet and lunged. I grabbed the rusted hook dangling from the chain above me and swung it. It ploughed into the front of the thing's head, caving it in. It went limp. The momentum from swinging the hook almost made me fall backwards into the trough of blood. I steadied my footing and dropped down next to Rowan. 

He laid motionless. There was a gaping wound along the side of his neck and he didn't so much as gurgle. I knew there was nothing I could do. With tears streaking down my cheeks I turned and began to somberly make my way up the flight of stairs. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw something move. I turned to look and saw the Masked Man yank the rusted claw out of its head and stand. It straightened itself and turned to meet my gaze. 

I ran frantically up the remaining steps. I could hear the thing let out an animalistic screech as it flew through the air behind me. I burst out of the basement and into the living room, making a clear dash for the front door. The Masked Man threw itself into me, sending me spiralling. I landed on a glass coffee table, which shattered from the force. I lay in pain on a bed of broken glass as the creature that had killed my friends loomed. It dropped down on top of me and lowered its face agonisingly close to mine. It was now that I finally got a good look at what it looked like under the mask.

The thing's face looked like a naked mole rat, bleached white with chemicals. Its eyes were a mess of tumours and scar tissue, filled with a black-purple pus festering in the sockets. The soft tissue of its nose and ears looked partially digested. The gums were black and oozing a mephitic ichor, lined with fragments of tooth-bits. Its front two cuspids, however, looked perfectly maintained and began protruding even further out. They now looked longer than my index finger and as sharp as razor wire. 

I shoved a shard of glass deep into the thing's neck. It pierced clean through to the vertebrae, embedding itself. Black, tar-like blood began to ooze, then spurt violently, out of the wound. The Masked Man fell backwards, writhing around on the floor in pain. I staggered to my feet, limping to the front door before breaking into a half-sprint. 


Afraid it would come after me, I ran straight to the next door neighbour. I began pounding in their door until I saw a light come on upstairs. I heard movement in the house and the door opened. Blinking the sleep out of his eyes and wearing a lime green bathrobe was Gary, my Sunday school teacher. He recognised me instantly and brought me into the safety of his home when he saw that I was drenched in blood. He laid a plastic sheet on a couch and told me to sit while he made tea. 

I sat and tried to catch my breath. I was still reeling from the night's events. Still, I felt safe in Gary's front room. It smelt like my grandma's house. I took out my phone and with a shaking finger tried to ring my mother. The kettle boiled and Gary poured my tea. He walked in from the kitchen, handed me the mug and sat down next to me. We called the police and I spent the next few minutes trying to explain to him what'd happened. 

Once I had, he seemed to go into shock. He just sat there, bound by my words. Eventually he snapped out of it and slowly turned to look at me. He told me that I could go clean up in his downstairs bathroom and I realised the state I must be in. He showed me to the bathroom and left me to wash myself. It felt good to scrub the foetid grime from my skin. I tried to avoid looking at myself in the mirror. I was drying my face with a hand towel when I heard a knocking at Gary's front door. I assumed it was either my mother or the police and, evidently, so did Gary. 

The next thing I heard was his scream, followed by the door being thrown open. His screams were cut short and replaced with the beastial growl coming from what could only be the Masked Man. I turned to the bathroom door and frantically fumbled with the key, locking it. I dropped to the floor and curled up in a ball under the sink as I began to sob quietly to myself. I heard laboured footsteps coming from the hallway. Within seconds, they were just outside the door. 

A low scratching noise came, followed by a thunderous pounding as the Masked Man tried desperately to break down the door. Its hinges rattled as wood began to splinter. The mid section buckled and split. I could hear the wailing of sirens as police cars neared as the Masked Man's hand crept from the hole in the door. It felt around for the lock as pus leaked from the soft flesh and exposed nerve surrounding its black-purple fingernails. I could hear vehicles pulling up outside as I watched it hook its talons around the key. It ripped it, and the rest of the door handle, from the wood, sending splinters flying around the room. A group of police officers made their way through the front door. One swore to God when he saw what was left of Gary. The bathroom door fell to the side. The Masked Man stood in the hallway, staring into my soul and priming its teeth, which began protruding even further from its gums. There was a deafening gunfire and I clasped my hands around my ears, screaming as I watched the Masked Man get shot maybe half a dozen times. 

It staggered back then dropped to all fours as the police opened fire again. It climbed up the wall and began crawling upside-down along the ceiling. Three officers gave chase as one barged his way past the broken bathroom door and took my hand, leading me out of the house. I saw my mother's car parked amongst the police cars. She stood next to it, crying as two officers tried to console her. She saw me and ran over, wrapping me in her arms. 

The police kept me a little while longer to take a witness statement. Eventually my mother convinced them to let me come home with her. They agreed, took our address and told us that they'd call around tomorrow morning to talk further. I climbed into the back of my mother's car as she began to drive. She was silent, letting me rest as we neared our home. Soon, the rows of houses were replaced with trees. I watched them go by as I felt myself drifting off to sleep. The last thing I can remember of that night was seeing a white blur, something keeping pace with the car just beyond the [tree-line.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1dlkfzh/i_hit_someone_whilst_driving_at_night_it_wasnt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Because I'm a SAHM at their actually expect me to clean after them and call me lazy when I have a rough day with my baby and just don't do anything around the house other than clean up after myself and baby. There are days i'm so sleep deprived and they both come at me with ""after you have a baby you'll never sleep the same again so don't complain. that's part of being a mom"". If im seen taking a nap with baby, the lazy comment comes out again. I'm not even a SAHM, really. I work 2 jobs (babysit, tutor, and assist at my local HS) just that the scheduled times are like 5am-8am, 10am-12pm, and sometimes 4:30-6:30 and 7pm- 12am. While I'm working, my grandmother takes care of my baby but she constantly makes comments that she can't do it anymore because she's old. And i agree. Plus there's been times where she's under the care on my grandma and I come home and the baby is playing with the dog food or watching TV. My mom on the other hand has no idea how to make formula, if she's ever washed the babies bottles, there's milk residue left in them, she's tried to give my baby coffee and jokes about giving her wine or letting her smell it. I don't trust them anymore and feel like it's best for me to quit my jobs and really be home all the time. Aside from that, they're very judgmental about how i want to raise mh child. I have a younger sister who doesn't live with us she lives with my dad but anytime she comes over they cater to her and make comments like ""omg she works so hard and we have to make her dinner and lunch to take to work""

Setting: The Addams Family living room. Morticia is arranging flowers (a bouquet of thorns), while Gomez lounges on the couch, reading a Gothic romance novel on his tablet. Wednesday is on her laptop, and Pugsley is assembling something suspiciously explosive-looking at the coffee table.

Script:

Gomez: [gazing dreamily at his tablet] Ah, the thrill of technology, Morticia! So many terrible things can happen with just the press of a button.

Morticia: [smiling serenely] It’s positively ghoulish, isn’t it, darling? Though nothing beats the scent of fresh grave dirt in the morning.

Wednesday: [looking up from her screen] I’m learning coding. Imagine, Father. I could hack into the National Security database...or the PTA website.

Gomez: [with pride] That’s my girl. Ruthless as ever! But remember, leave a trail. A good hacker must always be traceable to keep the authorities on edge.

Pugsley: [holding up a smartphone with an ominous ticking noise] I made an app. It’s called ""Countdown to Doom.""

Morticia: [clasping her hands] Pugsley, that’s wonderful! Is it timed to the exact moment of civilization’s downfall?

Pugsley: [grinning] No, it’s just set to go off randomly. Keeps everyone in a delightful state of suspense.

Gomez: [laughing heartily] Ha! That’s the spirit! Keeps the neighbors guessing.

Wednesday: We don’t really need apps, though. I find it more satisfying to just ominously glare out the window. Seems to have the same effect.

Morticia: True, darling. But in this modern world, it’s nice to have...options.

[A doorbell rings—an overly cheerful, “normal” ring. Gomez’s face lights up.]

Gomez: [excited] Ah! The delivery! I ordered a haunted mirror on eBay. The seller claims it’s cursed.

Wednesday: I hope it’s better than that ""haunted selfie ring light"" fiasco.

Gomez: [winking at her] Yes, yes, but one must persevere in the hunt for authentic horror.

Morticia: [putting her arm through Gomez’s] Such a modern romance, ordering curses online. But you, my darling, remain my favorite curse of all.

Gomez: [smiling devilishly] Tish, you spoke French!

[They exit arm-in-arm, leaving Wednesday and Pugsley in the living room, who share a glance before resuming their macabre hobbies.]

It's the medication I'm doing research on that I think may be a good fit for me and my issues, if the psychiatrist agrees as well.

My question is, from what I've seen, this medication can really interfere with your life for weeks. I'm a contractor with 0 benefits. I don't get sick days or paid time off. I can't afford to miss work for weeks at a time if the medication side effects end up being really rough at first. 

What did you all do when you started this medication with a job you couldn't take off from? Did you just force yourself to go to work and deal with the side effects, even if you weren't able to actually do the job well?

I'm honestly really afraid of starting on a new medication that has the potential to make me nonfunctional for an unexpected period of time. The only other SSRI I was on was Lexapro, which made me extremely tired. I got around it for work by drinking a lot of coffee and then sleeping when I got home. Honestly, just the extreme tiredness was horrible to deal with. My days mainly consisted of work and sleep. Idk what I'd do if I had that on top of other side effects. 

What do you all think? Should I look into a different SSRI? I have health anxiety and worry about medication side effects a lot. I hear Zoloft is generally well tolerated compared to other SSRIs, but this sub seems to imply otherwise.",1,1730044777.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False

This promotion didn’t seem too bad. I was paranoid it was tricking me, but it was basically - pick 3 items, then became 6 items and spend $40 now (from their promotional page - fyi). Then after you order - you can claim one freebie per day (it chooses order). So you type in - “dailyfree” to get your free item with no additional purchases. 

My freebie items weren’t too bad:
*3 egg boiling capsules
*Drain smell sticks
*Body oil
*Fruit body scrub
*2pc outfit
*Reusable pads
*and I guess bc I checked out… I get to pick another extra gift?? 🤷🏼‍♀️

I was able to claim my Egg Boilers. Anyway not sure if it will work for everyone, but it was “dailyfree”. I also have Credit spend codes going. 
*claimcredit 
*freereward

Also have success with
*dealdash (up to 5 - 99% off items with $30 purchase - timed - be fast or you do lose)
*discount card 000
*discount card 999
*dailybox777 (usually 5 chances at different stuff)

I can’t remember if this is one of the ones I find squirrelly:
*dollar for dollar (this might be a - invite your friends… cannot remember*
Ohh another goodie..
*CJPicks - free item with $40+ order

Anyone have hidden gems that I missed or can elaborate better on?

People like this one, but I never understood it exactly…
*creditrain - though it doesn’t seem to trigger *Just* by typing it in. It says you need to be invited, but it eventually procs. But you have to collect the credits and coupons.

Despite being an introvert with a smidge of social anxiety (like so many redditors), I crave meaningful, in-person connections.

Objective: 37F (i.e., geriatric by reddit standards), single, no kids, graduate degree.

Physically: 5’8”, HWP, not ugly (if I may be so arrogant).

Subjective: introverted but situationally sociable, calm but occasionally silly and excitable, analytical, perpetually cold.

Likes: trying – and attempting to recreate – new food, coffee/tea/boba hangouts, road trips to anywhere/nowhere, overusing parentheses.

ISO: I would loooove to find someone to go on hikes, day trips, and food adventures with. I generally get on well with fellow introverts, those with social anxiety, and those who are neurodivergent.

I’m not looking for a hookup, nor am I interested in talking to one of those “discretion preferred” or “I’m not looking to change your situation or mine"" types.

It turned out great, even if I cant remember exactly what the original was like.  Nice and tangy, dense with a soft chewiness inside and crisp exterior.  Could be a little sweeter and I think I will roll the dough balls in chia before baking next time.  Wanted to share and maybe get some recommendations for alterations I could try.

1gde1qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LynnwoodWA/comments/1gde1qo/seeking_advice_first_time_fender_bender_with/,"Seeking advice, first time fender bender with infant","Yesterday we stopped at a stop sign in Bothell and got rear ended at 30mph. Our 6mo has a minor bruise on his face and there’s food and coffee plastering the inside of our brand new leased car. In utter confusion I get a picture of the other party’s insurance (expired), a picture of a picture of their driver’s license (did not have it on hand), and snap a pic of their license plate. They get pictures of our insurance and driver’s license.

They drive off and I focus on helping my wife make sure our kid is okay. My wife was driving and I didn’t realize I accidentally forgot to get her driver’s license back from the other party before they took off. 

Within a couple hours we go to Seattle Children’s Urgent Care in Everett, and everything seems fine with the kiddo. There are no other injuries, so we call it a day and decide to sort everything out the next day.

I’m looking for advice on how to proceed, I did not:

1. Call the police at the time of the accident. Didn’t know I was supposed to

2. File any report yet, I don’t know where to start. I found the WA collision report website, but I don’t know if I should fill it out or if law enforcement should. I also don’t know if I should go to a Lynnwood police dept or a Bothell one. I live in unincorporated SnoCo, does that mean I need to go to the sheriff? We have no interest in getting the other party in trouble, we just want to cover our bases from an insurance/fault perspective.

3. Contact Toyota (our lease company) for repair costs. Car is brand new (less than 1 week), and I’m afraid this incident will impact our lease history with Toyota. We’ve never been in an accident before.

Thanks for reading, I appreciate the help.

1gddzqs,https://i.redd.it/vacpzmnllbxd1.jpeg,Echoes ACT 3 is a S-H-I-T Stand,"In the fourth Part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Diamond is Unbreakable, we're introduced to the concept of ACT Stands with Koichi's Echoes: A new type of Stand that undergoes evolution as its user grows as a person and develops their resolve. These Stands start off with powers and forms that are (deceptively) weak, but become more powerful and impressive-looking as they evolve. At least in theory, because the final form of Echoes, ACT 3, being a steaming pile of shit contradicts that a little.

Let's back up a bit and talk about the preceding ACT's of Echoes, just so you'll get a clear picture of why 3 is such a garbage disappointment in comparison. We're first introduced to Echoes [as an egg](https://static.jojowiki.com/images/5/50/latest/20221022032815/Echoes_Egg_Summoning_Edited_DIU_Ep4.gif), representative of how Koichi's fighting spirit had yet to truly exist but of the potential for it to. Now, you're probably wondering why this egg should be viewed as better than the third ACT of the Stand. Well, the answer is simple: when we look at the mystery of the egg's unknown capabilities and potential, along with the general inoffensiveness of its nature, there's a clear and marked superiority to the flaming dumpster filled with prom night babies known as ACT 3.

Then there's [Echoes ACT 1](https://static.jojowiki.com/images/9/93/latest/20191015214945/Koichi_with_Echoes1.png). Right off the bat, this guy already tops all the charts in every facet of its existence. Look at that prime Stand design: the excellent shades of green, and artfully placed gold. The  larva-like body structure, oversized helmet with the blinders and beak, contrast between the arms and wheels, and the disproportionate tail. My God, it even has a rattle at the end. Koichi hit gold right from the beginning with this one, and that's without even getting into its powerset: being able to slap on sounds and phrases on a person or object, [causing them to hear the sentence or onomatopoeia](https://static.jojowiki.com/images/d/d3/latest/20191015214328/Echoes_act1_powa.gif). Not only does this allow him to trick and manipulate opponents, the noise will increase over time and phrases will even be able to overpower the thoughts of the targets.

Combined with a range of 50 meters, being able to relay what it hears to Koichi, and use an infinite amount of sounds, Echoes ACT 1 easily sets a bar that it's later incarnation will totally fail in nearly every metric in trying to replicate. But even ACT 1's top tier nature is easily eclipsed by its immediate successor: [Echoes ACT 2](https://jojowiki.com/File:EchoesACT2_forming_word.png).

This bad boy comes out when Koichi battles the OG Yandere Yukako Yamagashi, showing how he's grown to overcome getting dommed by a crazy thot constantly pegging him with her hairection. ACT 2 stands proud with a sickass Cell (RIP Toriyama) inspired design: a shelled armor across its new humanoid body, with a badass high collar leading into shoulder pads and an awesome giant tail that has a deadly stinger. Bitches look at this thing, and instantly flood themselves. Most impressively, ACT 2's power serves as a direct evolution of ACT 1's: instead of the sound of words, [what matters now is their meaning](https://youtu.be/rnxtDUfkxW8?si=FksN4PcBxS_CWp-E).

ACT 2, in addition to a pretty hefty speed boost, is able to produce words that are empowered based on their meaning. Put ""Sizzle"" on a surface, and it will feel almost as hot as a JoJo's mother. ""Whoosh"" sends someone flying back like they got caught in the hurricane force wind generated by Polpo's cheeks clapping. In an upgrade over ACT 1, ACT 2's sounds don't need to be placed on a surface, but can be generated by a bubble, an ability Koichi creatively uses to temporarily stop Sheer Heart Attack from pursuing him and the downed Jotaro. In a downgrade from ACT 1, ACT 2 can only do this with one word at a time and needs to manually take back the original word to use new ones. But with the greater strength in ability and same wide range, ACT 2 shows itself a worthy successor to the already awe-inspiring ACT 1.

Now comes the trial by fire, the ultimate test that would break lesser men and did break this one: the next evolution of Echoes, ACT 3, had to come after the complete and utter gigachad known as ACT 2. The potential to shit the bed was higher than even the voice of love can take you, and odds of success lower than the likelihood of Polnareff getting to shit in peace. One does not simply ~~walk into Mordor~~ surpass perfection, afterall. But nevertheless, Koichi persisted in his growth, and so his Stand evolved to follow him. And when we look at how Echoes changed into ACT 3, there is only one unassailable conclusion to be had: Not even Jonathan Joestar himself could find something favorable about this little bastard.

[Let's start with the design](https://static.jojowiki.com/images/0/09/latest/20220109011631/Echoes_ACT3_Appearance.png). Right away, bitch instantly goes down two full letter grades for ditching the tail in exchange for some bullshit little nub that looks like he shoved his buttplug in the wrong way. Fuckboy trades off that pristine green shell and peak armor for some goofy-ass little kid look, with a bunch of green balls that make it look like it's covered in tumors. I get that it's supposed to be [Koichi as a Stand](https://jojowiki.com/Interview:JOJOVELLER_Stand_Guide_Commentaries#Echoes_ACT3), but damn, what a fucking downgrade. Just look at those shitty little shoes.

But you know, it's not entirely unsalvageable. Sure, in terms of visuals ACT 3 is the equivalent of the impacted excrement trapped in the asshole of a 400 pound person that needs to be loosened by hand, and I want to invite this thing to an eleven course dinner to serve beef and coffee for each one, and then bust all the plumbing so I can watch it dance around in agony and cry like the small and stupid creature it is, but hey. Looks aren't everything. It has a wonderful personality, really.

The biggest problem with ACT 3, that truly makes it the disgusting little abortion out of the nightmares of the few anti-abortionists not in it for the misogyny, is it's stupid, shitty power. Note the usage of the singular there, because it's a pretty big part of the issue.

[When we're first introduced to ACT 3](https://youtu.be/zciE8sqTIlo?si=4bMYTECE4f109q5e), with Sheer Heart Attack on the prowl and Koichi out of options, ACT 3 appears on the scene to provide the way to defeat a nigh-unstoppable Stand: charging up a special move, and then unleashing a barrage of punches that would make Star Platinum shed a tear in pride...and then getting pancaked by an undeterred SHA in foreshadowing to how dogshit it's very existence is. But the true power reveals itself soon after with the Three Freeze: ""freezing"" the target in place by weighing it down with a force equivalent of 40-50 kilograms, an obvious extension of its users massive bitchbreaking meat...

...and that's all it does. Ever. For the rest of Part 4, and going off Part 5, the literal end of the universe, the rebirth of the universe, and then the re-rebirth of the universe. Because that's the only goddamn thing ACT 3 can do. It should be obvious why even Kakyoin wouldn't want that rotten little cherry on top of the shit sundae that is this Stand.

For Echoes to go from a seemingly weak Stand with unbelievably powerful and creative abilities, that Koichi could spend his entire life trying to grasp the full potential of and still fail to make more than a drop in the bucket, to Hierophant-Green's-puberty-looking-ass cockroach made of turds with the powerset of C-Moon if Pucci decided to go full white trash mom during its gestation is an unbelievably pathetic evolution by any metric. For a series that's incredibly famous in part for how creative and unique it's powers can be, Echoes is the bloody menstrual stain on the snow-white church gown everyone in town is terrified at the existence of.

""It's a continuation of the theme, the weight of words!"" Keep huffing that copium buddy, and you'll end up like [Mother Teresa](https://youtu.be/21oijL8oxzQ?si=XhEUVJX898yjHLoh).

""ACT 3 said its powers are based on rhyme!"" One, ""three"" and ""free"" might rhyme but they sure as shit do not produce ""freeze"" no matter how much you try to make sense of Engrish. Two, even if we did accept this to be true, then what about the other words? Sneeze, breeze, cheese, squeeze, disease, tease, seize...why the fuck did we never see ACT 3 bust out a vaguely connected power based on words like that and just instantly go for the most broken one possible? Because Three (Free) (and Freeze apparently), ACT 3 isn't a Stand, it's a win button. Every fight ACT 3 is in uses its sole ability to instantly end the opponent even faster than the average chud you can find around these parts lasts when watching an anime with underage girls.

Sheer Heart Attack? Instantly defeated, Kira just gets to slap Koichi around a bit like he's his son and Kira's a major league sports player before Jotaro resumes the assbeating. Highway Star? Instant defeat for Josuke to make the distance, and the sole interesting use of the power when fucking with that bitchass hoe nurse. Enigma? Instant defeat for Josuke to perform a D'Arby. Cheap Trick? Instant defeat that neutralized Cheap Trick as a threat even if it took Rohan to deliver the finisher. Final battle? Instant defeat for Jotaro to lay the smackdown. No matter how you try to slice it, ACT 3 is not a fighting Stand, its a button for Araki to push when it's time for the enemy to get their balls three freezed and stop being a problem.

Now, maybe this wouldn't be such a problem if ACT 1 and ACT 2 could step in for their brother, who clearly didn't get enough oxygen at birth. It's a lot easier to eat a shit sandwich if you can work in some delicious filet mignon and decadent chocolate cake after all. But no, because ACT 3's stupid ass apparently is too big for anyone else to fit in the panels, we never get to see either of the previous god-tier ACT's again, beyond a brief cameo in Golden Wind when Koichi uses ACT 1 to stalk Giorno and that alone, because clearly it's not a smart idea to try to do anything other than weigh the guy you're trying to investigate down.

At the end of the day, this little buttmunch serves as a stark reminder of how Dio is full of shit, because with ACT 3, we know that there really is such a thing as ""the worst Stand"". ACT 3 hits a home run:  it looks like shit, its ability is dumb as fuck, and its fights are as boring and one-note as the cope of the average fucktard trying to explain why a cartoon made for kids is actually an amazing and deeply mature masterpiece. It's pretty much just offensive to all five senses, like [Christina Aguilera](https://youtu.be/KhKmJna0QL4?si=OfJMD0l-Bqj_AWco) or Joel Schumacher's Phantom of the Opera. Just look at Echo Echo and its own Ultimate evolution in Ben 10 to see what Echoes could have become if it wasn't such an impotent cuck. The fact Koichi is able to take this walking pile of disappointment and wasted potential for what could have been an easy contender for the GOAT Stand, and make it into just a piece of crap, is perhaps the greatest sign of why Jotaro thinks he's so reliable and probably put him in his will at the expense of his ex-wife.

**TL;DR:** Despite having a strong start with ACT 1 and a really cool evolution in ACT 2, Echoes ultimately falls short as a Stand due to ACT 3. From a combination of a comparatively boring design, uncreative and limited powerset, and lack of really engaging fight scenes, ACT 3 trips up the great momentum Koichi had going with his potential growth as a Stand user and serves as a poor final point for his evolution.

1gddwc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1gddwc2/how_to_choose_the_perfect_brandable_business_name/,How to Choose the Perfect Brandable Business Name? (Day 1),"Hey Reddit! If you’re kicking off a business, you already know one thing: a name can make or break you. It’s often the first impression someone gets of your brand, and it sticks with them (or doesn’t) long after they’ve left your website. So, how do you pick a business name that people will remember? Here’s a breakdown of how to go from a blank slate to the perfect brandable business name.

1. **Start with Your Audience**

Your name should click with your target audience. Let’s say you’re starting a trendy coffee shop aimed at young, working professionals. Names like “Grind & Go” or “BrewSpace” signal the kind of vibe they’re looking for: something fast, convenient, and professional. Compare that to a more generic name like “City Coffee Shop” that doesn’t hit home.

**Example:** Imagine you’re launching a clothing brand for eco-conscious, young adults. Instead of something like “Eco Wear” (kind of bland, right?), a name like **“EarthThreads”** could communicate your values in a unique way.

# 2. Short, Sweet, and Memorable

Ever notice how the big brands have short names? Think **Nike**, **Apple**, **Uber**. A short name is easy to remember, and if people remember you, they’re more likely to talk about you, recommend you, and visit your website again.

If you’re launching a tech product, maybe avoid names like “Superior Digital Solutions, Inc.” and consider a name like **“Spark”** or **“Swiftly”**—they’re short, memorable, and have a fresh, energetic feel.

# 3. Reflect Your Brand’s Personality

Think about your brand's vibe—are you fun and creative or serious and professional? Your name should give a hint of that. For example, **BuzzFeed** has a playful, friendly vibe, whereas **Goldman Sachs** sounds serious and prestigious.

**Example:** Let’s say you’re starting a financial consulting firm, and you want to come across as professional and trustworthy. A name like **“Wealthwise”** works because it’s a mix of clear purpose and a professional tone.

# 4. Stand Out from the Crowd

It’s easy to fall into the trap of choosing names that sound familiar or follow a trend. But if you want your name to stick, aim to be original. In the tech world, we’ve got tons of companies named “Cloud” something or “Tech” something. Going for something unique can make you memorable.

**Example:** Instead of “Tech Solutions,” maybe go for something like **“BrightByte”** or **“NimbleNet”** that sounds fresh and gives a sense of innovation.

# 5. Check for Domain Availability

Nothing’s worse than falling in love with a name only to find the domain is taken. Before you get too attached, check for availability. If the ideal “.com” is taken, you could get creative by adding a word. For instance, “getspark.com” or “sparkHQ.com” could work if “spark.com” is taken.

**Pro tip:** Use sites like Namecheap or GoDaddy to check availability, and don’t forget to check social media handles too!

# 6. Test It with Real People

Once you’ve narrowed it down to a few names, get some honest feedback. Share your top picks with friends or potential customers and ask what comes to mind when they hear each name. You might find that what you thought was a clear winner gives off the wrong vibe—or that it’s not as memorable as you thought.

**Example:** If your top name pick is **“Pine & Co.”** for a sustainable brand, but people keep thinking it sounds like a candle company, you’ll know it’s time to rethink. Testing early can save you a lot of headaches down the road.

7. **Final Thoughts**

A business name is the start of your brand’s story. It should be unique, catchy, and aligned with what you stand for. So take your time, try out ideas, and don’t settle for anything less than something that feels *just right*.

I tried searching this up, and I found multiple *other* display-related complaints, such as auto-brightness changing rapidly (which I do remember experiencing some years ago, but forgot about) and not being able to change brightness at all.

I couldn't find my specific issue documented.

Basically, I only have **two** brightness settings: 1) bright, and 2) way too dim to use.

Using my keyboard buttons (mine are F6 and F7 for dec/inc brightness, respectively), I do get a bar pop-up on the screen to show my brightness level. It has 10 clicks. At 1 (the lowest), it is the dimmest setting. From 2-10, it jumps to (what I assume might be max brightness) the 'bright' setting. There is no in between. This is the same if I go to Settings -> Display and adjust brightness there.

It's either way too dim to be useable, or so bright you have no complaints other than battery.

Is this a common issue? Any fixes?

Thanks in advance.

Now that I've typed this out and ready to click 'Post', it seems to have made me a liar...Sometimes the screen jumps into an 'auto brightness adjust' routine and does actually have modulation of its brightness. I can see it adjust through different gradients of brightness (nits, if you will). From there, I can manually adjust via my keyboard buttons, but doing that seems to 'break' the auto-brightness routine and it jumps back to the min/max brightness dichotomy.

Maybe the thing here is that I almost always (like \~99% of the time) use my laptop at a desk in a well-lit room, also with external displays, so the brightness likely does not modulate nor would I notice it. Now, I'm trying to use it in a car or in a coffee shop near windows and it's agony.

This is certainly a software issue. Is there some driver that I can disable or reboot to get it to act right?",1,1730043750.0,DellXPS,0,1.0,False

We both wanted to start a family together and we’re not getting any younger. Everything has been planned, we conceived almost right away on our honeymoon. 


Right now we have about $9,000 in savings. I earn about $5,000 a month before taxes and she’s at $2500 a month. Our rent is $1900 then about another $600 for utilities. We’re barely scraping by right now without our baby even being born yet. I try to live as cheaply as possible. Bring lunch to work, don’t go out to eat or even get iced coffees anymore. I feel like I just spend money on gas, grocery store and bills 


My wife doesn’t seem motivated to earn more. I think with time my income will increase with my career, especially if I go into business for myself and stop working for someone else. I’ve been trying to encourage her to move in a new career direction since anything is better than $2500 a month. Especially in MA (both born and raised here). We’re also considering trying to move to a lower cost of living area but even that will result in running through all of our savings. We both come from pretty dysfunctional families so there’s a total lack of support on that end.


Just wondering if anyone here has suggestions. Ideally I would love to have my wife stay home and not have to work but it’s just not in the cards. I’ve considered career moves but I’d probably take a pay cut for some years to really get anywhere beyond where I’m at, and I generally love my job and see other guys supporting their families doing what I do.

The Uber ride was about an hour long. The conversation with the male driver started off good. We were chatting, laughing, and joking around. 

My friend and I discussed our experience at the club and how the women were dressed in extremely revealing outfits (we spoke about how we would never feel SAFE dressing like them at the club, not insulting them or insinuating anything inappropriate).  We discussed how men in the past have treated us poorly and also how the security at the club was very intense - grabbing us and touching us all over. We kept the conversation light hearted by discussing these topics with a lot of jokes, we laughed the whole time. 

Our Uber driver joined in on the jokes and asked us a lot of questions. He was heavily involved in the conversation which we enjoyed. 

Until we were near our destination…
The driver asked us “to continue the conversation over coffee”. My friend replied jokingly “at this time of the night?! I don’t even like coffee” then he said “how about a glass of wine then?” She replied “no no no. we’ve had more than enough wine tonight,  I think we are good for the rest of the week.” Then he said using my name “(my name), can I have your Snapchat then?” And I said “no I don’t have Snapchat. I don’t really use Instagram either. Not a social media person.”. He kept trying to ask us more but I kept speaking over him directly to my friend so the conversation would end.

We got out of the car and waited for my mom as she was 5 minutes away. I noticed the driver still hadn’t left the station. We crossed the road to go inside the station as it was cold out and the driver drove past us again. At that point, I picked up my pace and got inside, but then my mom had arrived. 

I only felt unsafe after he had asked us for coffee, before that I thought he was just making conversation. I slept on it and began to worry as I had been drinking and wonder what could’ve happened if I were alone and if the destination was my home instead of a public space where my mom was coming to get me. 

I worry what may happen if another young woman finds herself alone with a man with this sort of intention…
But I also feel bad for reporting as maybe we led him on? I know it’s wrong to think like this as we genuinely were not being provocative, just having a good time and discussing “controversial” topics.

I've been noticing a lot in the last years how transactional a lot of my friendships have become (and yet I haven't changed my behavior and I still do my best to be generous for other people).

It's normal for me not to ""bill"" friends 10 euros each for pizza when I invite them to eat for dinner at my place (we are all working professionals and honestly spending 50-80$ on pizza once in a while isn't gonna break the bank for any of us), yet they'll do it to me. Yes economy is shit and there's inflation but I also really truly feel people have become more greedy, individualistic and transactional than before.

I was in my hometown for a month, visiting an old friend of mine. Over the time I was there, I bought her kids gifts and random treats, got her a nice bday gift, bought her coffee etc and then on the day I was leaving we were supposed to meet at a café and she literally made sure she did not pay for my coffee while buying herself lunch (that was the only thing I was getting). And she has a good job and earns well so this isn't about money.

This shit makes me so depressed. I remember when my grandparents used to host their friends and do so much for them, and it was reciprocatee and friendships were solid. They had a lot less money too. 

People just won't do stuff for their friends anymore, esp in western cultures - they won't spend time/effort, especially of they know they won't get money for it.

I’m trying to talk to my ex about what made us break up, and she keeps saying how I never listen to her and made her feel like a priority too. Is this a sign of controlling behavior and heavy jealousy? Should I just stop talking to her? I still have strong feelings, which makes it difficult. ",2,1730043035.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

These energy balls are perfect for a quick snack, pre-workout boost, or midday pick-me-up. Easy to make and packed with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, they’re a great way to fuel your body with clean, natural energy.

In this recipe, you’ll learn how to make these nutrient-packed energy balls, along with tips to customize them to your taste and nutritional needs.

**Why You’ll Love Superfood Green Energy Balls**

Superfood Green Energy Balls are easy to prepare, full of flavor, and packed with nutritional benefits. Each bite provides a combination of protein, fiber, healthy fats, and complex carbs to keep you energized throughout the day. The addition of green superfoods like spirulina or matcha offers a boost of antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, while nuts and seeds add satisfying texture and crunch.

**Ingredients for Superfood Green Energy Balls**

**Base Ingredients:**

* **1 cup pitted dates** (softened by soaking in warm water if needed)
* **1/2 cup raw almonds**ﾠ(or any other nuts like cashews or walnuts)
* **1/4 cup rolled oats**
* **1 tablespoon chia seeds**
* **1 tablespoon flax seeds**
* **1/4 cup shredded coconut**ﾠ(optional, for extra texture and flavor)

**Superfood Boosters:**

* **1 teaspoon spirulina powder** or **matcha powder** (for the green color and nutrient boost)
* **1 tablespoon hemp seeds** (optional, for extra protein)
* **1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup** (optional, for added sweetness)

**For Rolling/Coating:**

* **Shredded coconut, matcha powder, or crushed nuts** for coating (optional)

**Step-by-Step Recipe for Superfood Green Energy Balls**

**Step 1: Blend the Ingredients**

1. In a food processor, combine the pitted dates, raw almonds, and rolled oats. Pulse until the mixture starts to come together and form a sticky texture.
2. Add in the chia seeds, flax seeds, shredded coconut, and your chosen superfood powder (spirulina or matcha). Pulse again until all ingredients are well combined, scraping down the sides if needed.
3. Taste the mixture; if you’d like a touch of sweetness, add honey or maple syrup and pulse again.

**Step 2: Shape the Energy Balls**

1. Scoop out about 1 tablespoon of the mixture and roll it into a ball. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
2. For a finishing touch, roll each ball in shredded coconut, matcha powder, or crushed nuts for extra flavor and presentation.

**Step 3: Chill and Store**

1. Place the finished energy balls on a baking sheet and refrigerate for about 20–30 minutes to firm up.
2. Once chilled, transfer the energy balls to an airtight container. Store them in the fridge for up to a week or freeze for longer shelf life.

**Tips for Making Perfect Superfood Green Energy Balls**

1. **Use soft dates:** Softer dates blend more easily and create a stickier mixture. If your dates are dry, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes, then drain before using.
2. **Adjust consistency:** If the mixture is too sticky, add a little more oats. If it’s too dry, add a few more dates or a small amount of water.
3. **Customize with add-ins:** You can add more seeds, swap nuts, or try other superfoods like cacao nibs, goji berries, or turmeric powder for a unique flavor twist.

**Why This Recipe Works**

Superfood Green Energy Balls are a satisfying blend of flavors and textures that pack a nutritional punch. The dates and oats provide natural sweetness and a good source of fiber, while the nuts and seeds add protein and healthy fats. Spirulina or matcha contributes antioxidants and essential minerals, giving these energy balls an extra boost to support wellness.

**Serving Suggestions for Superfood Green Energy Balls**

* **Pre- or post-workout snack:** The combination of protein, fats, and carbs makes these a great snack for before or after exercising.
* **Midday pick-me-up:** Enjoy one or two with tea or coffee to keep your energy steady throughout the day.
* **Gift idea:** Package a few in a decorative jar or box as a thoughtful, healthy gift.

**Superfood Green Energy Balls** are a delicious, convenient, and nutritious snack that will keep you fueled and energized. With simple ingredients and endless possibilities for customization, they’re a perfect addition to any healthy eating plan.

I felt you just breaking me down in your head throughout the night. We clicked at the bar, you went from “give me a week” to going right back to “babe you’re so loud”. Then it was the age gap that was the problem, then it was because we didn’t sleep good together after you went straight to bed knowing it could be our last night together. You’re tired, I get it, so was I. But that’s you, those are the natural thoughtful things you never did because it was never me you wanted. You didn’t even say anything after we had sex but didn’t mind doing it again in the morning. Feelings were always different for you I suppose. 

Then I got a tight hug and a coffee. No tears. No sadness. Just silence and “ok”. Feel like I just did you a favor. Did what you never had the courage to do yourself and just tell me it’s over I don’t want you.  It was always on me. Now I’m sure you’re relieved. You don’t have to lie to me anymore. You can give him all the attention now. The sad thing is he has no idea how many times you hurt me to choose him, over and over and over again. He’ll never appreciate that. You chose him our entire relationship, and I feel so fucking stupid with all the words you said this past week to me that you would maybe just maybe choose me this time. But of course not.. of course not. You chose him every time and chose him in the end and you barely flinched.

I don’t take anything back I said. Glad we left on somewhat better terms and you didn’t lie about your “good relationship” with him and real me back in to that drama. Crazy tho. After all you put me through, you picked that guy just because you didn’t want to tell HIM the truth for once. One last time to be the loser. One last time to feel like shit. One last time to be disappointed. One last time to remind me you don’t want me and you really never did. He was always there and I didn’t even get to be in an actual relationship with you because he was in the picture the whole fucking time while I chased you endlessly like a fucking simp little bitch idiot. At least I got to stick to my boundaries in the end. 

You really wouldn’t cut that off to give us a shot. Everything I needed to know but didn’t want to hear push came to shove. You chose him. Makes no sense why you were so nervous yesterday, you were so calm. I knew it wasn’t gunna be me, and knew I would have to do this because you won’t. You’d keep me around to have sex, lie to me about whatever and remind me why you can’t be with me as long as you can.

Take Care M, I’m sure he’ll be an amazing partner for you when you let him step up to the plate and actually have to date you. ",1,1730042765.0,UnsentLettersRaw,0,1.0,False

As the title suggests, can we develop a web application for digital signage using Bubble?

The idea is to allow users (such as coffee shop owners, restaurants, etc.) to upload and manage their content (e.g., offers, menus) and display it on their screens.

Is this feasible with Bubble? If so, what are your thoughts on the platform's capacity? How many users could it handle, and how many screens could be managed effectively?

1. Pre-Heat water before you even pour into the Moka Pot. This will ensure that the coffee powder is not heated for too long which can cause it to develop a slightly burnt/bitter taste.

2. Pour the pre-heated water into the Moka Pot's bottom half and keep the level just below the valve. 

3. Now fill up the coffee holder with ground coffee. I use medium roasted coffee; and fill up the coffee holder. I use needles to ensure there are not clumps and i do not tamp it but instead just ensure its evenly levelled. 

3.1 Notes on a couple of filters which i tried recently: I place a metal filter on the bottom of the coffee holder and then place a wet paper filter on the top half of the Moka Pot. Made the coffee clearer!     

4. Light the gas stove and keep it at low-mid flame on the smallest burner and place the Moka Pot on it, use an additional heating plate if the Moka pot is too small to sit steadily on the burner.

5. Keep the lid open and watch for the coffee to begin oozing. When it does, reduce the flame to minimum.

6. Once you hear and see the coffee sputtering from the spout, take the Moka Pot off the flame and let it settle.

7. Once the coffee has stopped to ooze from the spout, you're coffee is ready!

All of this doesn't take even 10 mins and results in great tasting coffee.Hope this helped, please reply with your methods and I'd love to try what's been working for you.",3,1730042684.0,IndiaCoffee,2,1.0,False

1gddeew,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gddeew/aitah_for_seeing_my_crush_having_ex/,AITAH for seeing my crush having $ex,"I don't know if the following incident is horny, sad or depressing. It sounds like a perfect porn story but sadly it's true...



So I'm 21M, a university student. I have a huge crush on my classmate. And have already told her but she has said she doesn't like relationship stuff (I belong to Pakistan, a rather conservative society where relationships before marriage are not considered good let alone physical relationships). She is quite introvert and seems of good character. So I was quite heartbroken but I try doing different antics to impress her but she just laughs them off(not irritated) She has a very good male friend (another classmate) , who is tall+attractive. I always suspected that they both are together but he is in a relationship with some other girl and she doesn't go out with boys alone.



Now the main story is. 2 days ago, when our classes ended for the day, I saw them sitting in her car together and I got jealous AF so I put my scooty after them at a safe distance. They stopped outside some small house and went inside the gate. Now you can imagine my fury. I parked some yards away, and waited for a few minutes then climbed the wall.. I wanted to get inside the house at any cost, so I devised a quick plan and knocked on door. Till he came outside to check, I went to the back and hid there. He went back inside and then I knocked again and this time both of them scared and furious came outside and tried to check everywhere, leaving the main door open. I slowly slowly crawled away from wherever they were checking and when both of them were in backyard, I went inside the door. It was one bhk home, so I went quickly inside the only room and hid myself in the cupboard. They both came back and were in the living room. He was playfully teasing her. And she was saying that why he was with that other girl and didn't recognized her love earlier. Both were talking very sensually. (imagine my fury). Then she told him to be gentle as it was her first time and he said that he bet she wouldn't be able to walk on her legs afterwards. (imagine my fury). Then she asked him to wait there and she came to the room. She wore a very se#y make up and a sizzling bikini, and then asked him to come to the room. Then what i saw i couldnt believe my eyes, that she is the same naive girl. She danced for him on a really sensual song, and was literally behaving like a wh@re. I peeked in from the cupboard all the time and boy oh boy. For the next 4 hrs, he literally busted every hole that she had in multiple positions and not once gently, and she was enjoying it AF. She kept moaning and screaming loudly and he kept banging her from left, right and centre. Especially when they were trying the ""other hole"", she literally bled. And even then he pounded her in that hole one more time. On the bed, on the couch, leaning on wall from behind.. in missionary, in doggy,.. THEY TRIED EACH FUC\*ING THING...she even jokingly said to him ""forget walking, i wont be able to sit properly for weeks now""...thats the level of pounding she had recieved....



I was like where the F did that introvert and shy girl has gone whom I loved. I used to be very respectful and gentle around her but during all this episode he wasn't once gentle with her and even slapped her hard when she was blowing him. So after all this (4 hrs had passed), they both went to the attached bathroom and she was literally not able to walk properly. After a minute or two, her moans started again. Here I was in the cupboard, with teary eyes and a huge boner. I quietly came outside and sneaked outside the main door and then climbed the wall again and got home. All the night I was having the worst wet dreams of my life involving both of them. Yesterday in the class, both of them arrived separately as usual and were behaving like nothing had happened. She was still not able to walk properly. She was with her female friends, and I was feeling the very urge to talk to her. So I asked her for notes and she gave me those. I couldn't control myself and asked if she would like a coffee in the Cafe and she smiled and said that I've told you earlier, I don't go out with boys alone. I kept quite.. But wtf bro... Tell me straight away that you don't like me rather not wanting a relationship with anyone.



I don't know if I'm horny, sad or heartbroken since 2 days. Probably a mixture of all feelings. This event has probably given me a trauma for whole life... I can't even eat or sleep properly... She was the only girl whom I had ever loved in my life... Does this happen with all nice guys??,

This PCB is for a bluetooth kitchen, coffee, mixology, baking scale I’ve designed. I’ve done the hardware and app myself. 
I went with a 4 load cell design to keep things super thin while also maintaining a large weight capacity. Current competition in the coffee scale space charging ALOT of $$ for their scales use an HX711 so it wasn’t hard to make a more precise scale. Just.. don’t use a 9cent ADC..

I’ve had issues with the SH1107 flickering on camera so I don't like it. I find the SSD oleds are better but I needed the long skinny form factor to fit as close as possible and the long skinny SSD1309 etc are only 32px tall.
The cpu is an ESP32 just for TESTING. It’s already been replaced with a nordic chip in the new revision.

The last time she went on a date, her date didn’t like her. It was horrible, and her self-esteem took a hit. She was trying to keep her courage, but it was hard. She felt like she needed someone, a partner in her life, someone to share her experiences with, to laugh with, and to grow alongside through the rough path she’d had to go through. It wasn’t like she’d chosen this path, it’s just… she didn’t feel like a boy. She had transitioned completely, but the only ick was that… she hadn’t told her date, she hadn’t told you, {{user}}.

She was anxious. *What if they don’t want me anymore? What if they want a cis person… what if…* Thoughts like these swirled in her head. She hated it. She hated having those thoughts and hated having to hide this just to avoid meeting weird people. Her dating life had been difficult; either straight people didn’t want her because she wasn’t cis, or the bi and pansexual people she’d met seemed only interested in things that weren’t her, like pet play or other weird sexual stuff. That wasn’t her. She wanted a true relationship, built on trust, love, and comfort. And for that, she knew she needed to tell {{user}}.

She sighed, getting on the bus and glancing at your conversation. They hadn’t exchanged a lot, but enough to agree on meeting for a real date. She looked at the chat nervously and then wrote:

I’m so stupid…* She closed her phone, feeling defeated. *Another ghost… another failed date. I can’t believe it…*

She sighed, getting off at her stop and heading to the restaurant. *Maybe they’re on their way and just haven’t read it… but what if they come and react badly?* She ordered a coffee, waiting patiently for you, glancing around and nervously playing with her glass.

Im 28f filipina girl currently working in Kuwait as an OFW, Ive been here for more than 2 years now, the country is actually i might say boring and sad but I was able to manage it all because in those 2 years I was with a LDR with my boyfriend who is filipino too and hes in the Philippines, everything was great between us but later on I lost feeling because I feel like were both busy and I feel like I was the man in the relationship, im 7 years older than him. So we decided to broke up July of this year, feeling alone and lonely cuz obviously I cant stand being alone I installed a dating app to just distract from the break up. I talk to some guys mostly indians and local kuwaitis too, the first guy that Ive meet was a good guy but there was no chemistry at all and was mostly friendship and we only drink coffee at a cafe nearby my place and call it a day. Next guy was a kuwaiti, well call him JK, hes profile said hes 27 and all in all a good looking guy, so we met september 11, and from the get go I was already attracted to him, He was fun and looks young than in pictures, so he pick me up from my place and it was already 11pm at that time since i got off from work 10 pm, so we get some food and he ask where do we go and since im actually quite shy and I really dont know any place in Kuwait I let him lead, but at that night I wasnt planning on being intimate, he asked me then if I would like to chill at his place and my stupid self said yes, got in in his apartment very sneakily because hes older brother is in next apartment. So I was definitely enjoying his presence he talks and share things about him and hes very attractive and smells nice too, and the thing happened I was the one who kiss him first and we had sex, I slept there he was still sweet the morning after and brought me home. He reached out ask him to be his girl and I said yes, everything was fine the first week, I might say he lovebomb me promising me things like going to salon, buying me crocs watch movies and all those stuff couples do and saying he loves me thats hes happy for having me and all those sweet talks, and i admittedly believe all of it cuz in person i can feel that he cares. we text each other and calls at night too.

By next couple of weeks I started to feel him slowly pulling away, sometimes he left me on read, the text lessen and I also started asking if we can hangout outside not just at his place and he still assured me that we will. I developed anxiety because of him cuz i felt like the things that he did from the start is slowly fading away. and on top of that whenever we are together I can sense him being sad and also at start he doesnt want me to know hes last name or even his social media accounts, we talk in snap and whatsapp. I turned a blind eye to all those redflags and I started questioning myself if maybe I am the problem too maybe I wont ask too much but I know that Im not asking fro too much, never asked for money or any material things at all he never gave me anything at all, I just wanted to do normal couples do like going outside watch movies cuz he was always the one suggested that, I know as well that sometimes I havd redflag too like one time I ask if well break up or telling him that we wont last its becux for me its a defense mechanism foe him to act on his words.

Eventually we stop hanging out at his place because his brother found out about us and text me thru snap and i replied bcux at that time we didnt talk for 2 days cuz he left me on read again, that was the 2nd time. hes brother started asking question and i stupidly answered bcuz he was being nice. and i told JK about it in the morning and he was  mad at me , after that he suggested for us to get an apartment of my own so he can visit me from time to time, at that point I was feeling happy because atleast he still finds a way for us to see each other, but then again, the hot and cold surface once more. when we are together i know his happy althoug i feel like hes going thru something internally with family problems cux his parents are divorced and he lives alone for how many years, I thought my love would be enough for him you know. i thought to myself ill take care of him, that I can be his family and he will never feel alone again, boy was i wrong.

I can slowly feel him pulling away and we broke up and the next day got back together cuz i texted him and persuaded him to try again, I was madly inlove with him. I dont even know why tbh sometimes I feel that Im only infatuated or attach but I never felt any of this with someone before and the sex too for me was great. In order to save our relationship, I frantically look for an apartment call anyone check on fb market look for furnitures, and then we found one. we are already over a month of being together at this point. I am about to move in paid the deposit and all and 2 days before he bailed out, told me that hes mom and uncle will come here in Kuwait from saudi and we needs to go to saudi too, telling me that he might be arranged in a marriage, that hes sick, his mom has cancer, his grandmother too, all those excuses and u didnt even know if those were all lies. I Cried talking to him like my emotions are all over the place cuz I know whats coming and I know I cant save it anymore, he didnt promise me anything but its still hurt, cuz he couldve been honest with me. The day after he told me that he was still saying for me to calm down and he wrill try to postone and that he will still stya with me we dont need to moved in yet, telling me I was the first thing on his mind.

We met each other for the last stime a week ago cuz I wanted clarifications and to ask him were we stand and i didnt get any closure from him cux he basically force me to have sex with him and I gave in affter push and pulling, the happy guy I know slowly dissapeared and I see this man as he is. now i felt used and blindsided left with questions that will never be answred after i lfet the car he still texted me that we will pass this together and i replied goodnight and since then we ddint text each other for 5 days, I reach on the 25th broke NC becuz of the payment he need to trasnfer to me and also i miss him, i know u can call me stupid but I basically still chase him and pleaded with him to get back together and he refused. i felt awful he didnt wnt to talk even for few minutes at all, and just told me that he was sorry and he doesnt know if he was happy or just miserable and telling me that i will only end up miserable too cux his life is chaotic and that he is a hateful spiteful person and he wanted to love and cherish me but he couldnt. he told me once that he never let someone else in and I know that hes not mentally well and like dismissive avoidant im not really sure. it felt like hes not the guy i first met like hes detach already

so now im left wondering what to do, im so broken felt used wondering if did he ever loved me or liked me or he only played me, or his parents found out and pressured him cux he told me he will be deserted, I dont really know he never told me the exact reason why, he knows that im alone here in Kuwait i dont go out that much always work home set up and now i feel depressed, didnt eat for 2 days, everythings messy lose weight and got no motivation anymore, he told me that he already left kuwait and not sure if he will be back. and my vacation is gonna be on nov 1, 4 days from now.

and im thinking a. I should try to move on go to a gym, join a club and forget about him but the delulu part of me will always think that if im still here i will still hope that someday we will reach out because im delusional \\

b. go home and spend my 1 month vacation to freshen up but financially unprepared becuz this is not planned at all and i might cry again if ill come back here after the vaction is over.

c. go home for good and leave everything behind, since I have enough savings and start my own business

and tbh i wanted to go home, i just cant find enough reason for me to stay in this place anymore. my family knows and they are supportive of me going home, i jjst dont know maybe ill regret in one day and i maybe its impulsive.

please any advice will do, and criticism is fine cuz I know i did act stupid.",1,1730042142.0,BreakUps,0,0.67,False

1gdd5td,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1gdd5td/my_friend_doesnt_want_to_spend_time_with_me/,My friend doesn't want to spend time with me because of his girlfriend.,"Me (29M) and my best friend (24M) have been close friends for about 3 years now. Although we have widely different personalities, him being a complete extrovert and me the polar opposite (Labrador and black cat type of vibes) we generally find middle ground and respect each other's point of view. Once a week we scheduled an evening where we would have dinner, alternating who cooks regardless of who's apartment it might be at. Sometimes we would go away for a weekend, mostly just a night's stay at a B&B or a trip on his motorbike.

Him and his girlfriend (21F) got together not long after we started becoming close friends. Me and her would see each other in passing sometimes or have casual conversations but nothing serious. I had quickly realised that she would unfortunately never be a person I would be friends with. Not just because of the age gap but our different backgrounds and world views. This has never hampered me and my friend's relationship because we would sometimes include her in our weekly dinner plans and would arrange group outings for all to join. Our weekly dinners were never meant as group hangouts but only gave me and my friend a chance to catch up and unpack some frustrations.

At the end of last year however things started to drastically change, slowly we started to spend less time together despite many attempts from my side to arrange one-on-one evenings again. Our weekly dinners came to a crashing halt about two months ago since he's decided to continue studying. This meant that he would have to move away for Uni and give up his apartment and move in with his girlfriend and her parents in an attempt to save up some extra cash for when he leaves next year. Although it breaks my heart to see him leave I'm extremely excited and proud of him for making this decision and wish him all the best. This however resulted in a lot of difficult conversations.

After many dinner dates where he ambushed me by bringing his girlfriend along or not sticking to our prior arrangements I brought it up with him, telling him how it kind of sucks that he isn't respecting our friendship or my time/emotions. I understand the fact that he feels comfortable with both me and his girlfriend present and can share any intimate details with both of us but unfortunately I can't say the same. He has a wide group of acquaintances, as extroverts often do, but I keep a handful of close friends with whom I share my inner life and put my time and energy into. His response was that he and his girlfriend are a package deal and that is something I am going to have to get used to. I as a starch individualist struggled heavily with this sentiment but understand that it is the way he feels. I tried to communicate my point of view and we came to a sort of informal compromise, which basically means the issue was never really resolved.

Earlier this week it happened that we were texting and both complaining about our respective workloads. I suggested that we go on a trip for a weekend away to relax when the work cools down and he blatantly stated that he would not be going anywhere if his girlfriend is not going as well. Exhausted by this statement I told him to cancel any plans we had coming up and for him to let me know when he next wants to spend any meaningful time together. We hadn't spoken all week until today when I had arranged a coffee date for us to sort it out. I tried to hear him out on his explanation of why we can’t have one-on-one time together for longer than a casual lunch. He explained that he wouldn’t mind going away for a day or two but knows that there would be repercussions if he were to do so because him and his girlfriend had a huge fight the last time we went on an overnight bike trip and why would he do anything to upset her. In his own words he had chosen her and she’ll come first every time. I told him that I think it’s sad that he would deny himself opportunities like our road trips only to satisfy her. In the end nothing was really established as always and I’m feeling a bit lost as to whether this friendship has any future beyond casual coffee dates.

It was a surprise to get the new unit in the mail.

So I went back over my Amazon list of the past year- I had gotten a dremel tool and one of the screw on collars to hold the bits did not thread well- I wrote that company and they sent me a new unit.

I only did chocolate or mild caffeine including foods and beverages.  Around the start of 2023 i started doing energy drinks + coffee + all sort of other stuff like preworkouts and so on. 

I was doing like up to 4 energy drinks a day. At the end of 2023 i noticed whenever i cut down on caffeine and tried to quit i started getting mild depersonalization and anxiety, and i got DPDR before but it was only from benzos!! But the strange part whenever i reduced the caffeine some really bad withdrawals will come similar to any benzo. 

In 2024 i was on day 3 of quitting nicotine (I had already high anxiety from the nicotine withdrawals) and i drank a Monster energy drink can and BAM few hours later i got hit by the worst panic attack in my life with some insane depersonalization and derealization. 

I rushed and went to ER and had to walk maybe 5 kilometers or so because i was so scared to even take a taxi and i was in pure terror. I went to ER and after talking to them i went back home. But the thing is this heavy insane hell like anxiety never stopped. I was having constant back to back panic attacks and this lasted few weeks maybe 40 days or so? After that i still dealt with mild anxiety and DPDR. After 6 months the panic, anxiety and DPDR cameback again but im getting better at dealing with it. 

I have to say this. In 2019 i was hardcore addicts to many drugs including benzos and i never had such severe panic in my life prior to 2023. Only thing was caffeine + nicotine. But i doubt the nicotine because i also smoked a long time before and quit on my own zero issues. 

Caffeine for some can cause severe anxiety upon quitting. I mean 1-2 years withdrawals and damage the nervous system. 

Im getting better daily but still not back to normal

Obviously this is not ideal for necks and solutions exist, a mount that can swing the TV down to a reasonable viewing height then raised back up when not in use. This is great but annoying.

However, they have motorized mounts that can do this on the press of a button, but it's not automatic and you need yet *another separate remote* for this task. This is great but also annoying.

What about a motorized TV mount that has a HDMI-CEC passthrough to detect if a TV is powered on or off and adjust the position based on the state of the TV power? 


Does this product not exist? I'm flabbergasted in 2024 it does not. 


So my remaining solution is to hack in an IR blaster to do this task for me, but is it even possible to do with an Arduino or Rasberry Pi to act as a CEC-passthrough to get the state on the state of the TV in standby/powered mode and have the motorized mount act accordingly?

Reason behind this, I have a hatred of both overly complicated universal remotes or having 4 remotes on the coffee table to all perform different tasks, I'm trying to avoid all this and achieve A/V bliss through one **simplified** remote like a roku/appletv/google TV remote.

* I quit grad school because I realized that career wasn't for me. 
* For the past year I've been in a different career at the bottom level.

I am applying for jobs again. Do I include the two years of working at a coffee shop on my resume? Essentially it looks like I went from high level, down to minimum wage, slightly up to bottom level. I don't want to put that I was in Grad school during that time because it just looks poor, like I started something then quit (which is true). I also feel like putting that I worked at a coffee shop for two years takes away from where I was professionally previously because hiring managers scan down to only the last two jobs pretty often.

The day Anthropic announced Computer Use, I knew this was gonna blow up, but at the same time, it was not a model-specific capability but rather a flow that was enabling it to do so. 

I it got me thinking whether the same (at least upto a level) can be done, with a model-agnostic approach, so I don’t have to rely on Anthropic to do it. 

I got to building it, and in one day of idk-how-many coffees and some prototyping, I built Clevrr Computer - an AI Agent that can control your computer using text inputs. 

The tool is built using Langchain’s ReAct agent and a custom screen intelligence tool, here’s how it works. 

- The user asks for a task to be completed, that task is broken down into a chain-of-actions by the primary agent. 
- Before performing any task, the agent calls the `get_screen_info` tool for understanding what’s on the screen. 
- This tool is basically a multimodal llm call that first takes a screenshot of the current screen, draws gridlines around it for precise coordinate tracking, and sends the image to the llm along with the question by the master agent. 
- The response from the tool is taken by the master agent to perform computer tasks like moving the mouse, clicking, typing, etc using the `PyAutoGUI` library.

And that’s how the whole computer is controlled.

I love to listen to music, my favorite band since I was 15 lol is Blink 182(have seen them live three times). I like to watch movies and tv shows(who doesn’t?) - I’m definitely a horror girly, but I like other things too! I love ghosts and fall and spooky season.  I love to shop and get my nails done.

I live in western Canada, so a similar time zone to that would be ideal(exact same time zone not necessary, any North American time zone is close enough). I am looking for someone aged 30+. Does not expect constant/instant replies. I would like there to be daily communication, but I’m not constantly glued to my phone. I am looking for someone that is willing and able to put effort into conversation(I will do the same). Other than that, I’m very open to most other things and am not looking for a specific “type” of person! I’m looking for friendship first and foremost, but wouldn’t be opposed to it if the friendship evolved into something a bit more flirty/feelings develop. That being said, I’m not *looking* for something super serious, nor am I looking to relocate or anything like that. 

If you think this sounds like something you’d be interested in, please contact me(chat preferred over DM). Tell me a bit about yourself! I will ignore any single word responses - “hey” does not start a conversation. ",0,1730041029.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.5,False

1gdcoz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/lotus/comments/1gdcoz4/lotus_ltd_us_owners_group_questions/,Lotus LTD (US Owners Group) questions,"Hi, I am curious if the sub would recommend joining the owners group, as an enthusiast, before purchasing a car.  I'm \~10 months out from purchase.  I see on the website that there are access to classifieds among other things.  I'd love to hear any advice, or more about what to expect around enthusiast experience in the group. 

For context, I joined the Porsche Owners Group *after* I bought a Boxster and learned right away that there were actually a ton of benefits aimed at people who were looking to get into a Porsche, or change cars.  Additionally, there were regular club meet-ups, like Cars and Coffee and Happy Hours that were a great place to socialize with owners, ask questions....you know, just talk to people and hear their stories.  You learn things. People were really nice.  Looking back, I wish I would've joined that group before I purchased.  I sold that Boxster eventually. Loved it. Great fun. Nothing but a positive experience with the people and brand. 

So here I am, daydreaming about an Evora. The one in my head lately is likely Seneca blue, thanks to [](https://www.reddit.com/user/simba8814/). Fantastic color. Great choice!  It dawned on me as I've been doing my research that I should look into the owners group.  I'm in the Austin area, but would love to hear from people with experience in any one of the US chapters.

I am questioning my (25 F) relationship of almost five years with my boyfriend (28 M) and I don't know if it's something we can work through.,"Hello, Reddit! I’m a long-time lurker, but I’ve only now made this account to finally post about something that’s been bugging me for a long time. No, this is not a creative writing assignment, nor is it fiction, this is a genuine issue that I want to have a more objective opinion on. I’m sorry for any errors you may encounter, I am writing this exactly as my thoughts come to me.

I (25 F) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (28 M) for almost 5 years now, and although we’ve made many happy memories and overcame a lot of problems together, we’ve also struggled quite a lot with our relationship in the last 2 years. For the last year though, I’ve started having doubts if this relationship is worth fighting for, but there are many circumstances surrounding us that made me question my ability to decide on this matter. I will start explaining, but I think it would be most helpful to split this into a background of how we got into this relationship, our situation in the last few years, and the alarm signs I’ve noticed, in hopes of portraying this as objectively as I can.

Background: We’ve met more than 10 years ago, as teammates in a competition (I was 15; he was 17, going on 18). We spent that week going on walks together, talking a lot, we even went to a party and danced together, it was a fun time. I’ve developed almost instantly a huge crush on him, but we were in different high schools and there’s clearly an age difference, so after that competition, we couldn’t spend as much time together as before. Still, we kept in touch, and we would usually meet up at least once a month for a meal or coffee, we texted quite a lot, we talked on the phone from time to time – all in all, I can say we developed a friendship. Sometimes, he would do or say some things which I felt at the time were flirty, so, one year after meeting him, I confessed my feelings for him. He thanked me for telling him but politely rejected me, saying he really cares and even “loves me as a friend”, but he is not *in love* with me. Yes, it hurt, but I really liked him as a person and I really appreciated his friendship, so I just decided to keep being friends with him and move on. In the meantime, I had other relationships, and he did the same. Fast forward a few years, when I’ve noticed he had gone silent for quite a while. I was quite upset with his behavior, and so I stopped texting him (yeah, I know, quite immature), until one day I got a text from him asking me to meet up. We saw each other for lunch and then he offered to take me for a one-day-trip outside of our city, with only the two of us. I agreed, I have to say I was quite excited. We went, we had a really fun time, and since that day, I felt him becoming flirty again with me. I did not act on it though, because we were studying in different cities, so we were not able to see each other that often. That same year, he came to the city I was living in, met up with me for dinner, took a walk, and he held my hand for the first time. I was super excited, but once again, I did not act on it because I was doubting that he was actually into me after the time I confessed my feelings for him, 3 years prior. Finally, in the spring of 2019, after a week of seeing each other every single day, I had the courage to ask him for a kiss, and we finally had our first kiss. He then confessed that he realized he had romantic feelings for me since that day of our trip a year before, but he was scared to do anything about it due to the fact that a relationship with me would only be possible in a long-distance setting. Because of that, we decided not to pursue a committed relationship at the time, instead going with the flow and seeing if the opportunity arrives for us to become “official”. We started going on actual dates, but then, that autumn, he basically ghosted me for quite some time. I still texted him from time to time and tried to call him, but there was a period of a couple of months when I basically didn’t hear anything from him. Finally, at the end of December, he called me and asked me to meet up. We went for lunch, he told me the reason he ghosted was because he actually was going through a severe episode of burnout, bordering on depression, he also got sick for a while and he just self-isolated and didn’t keep in contact with anyone besides going to his classes. I was hurt that he didn’t tell me about any of this when it actually happened, but I felt it was more important to support him through this rough patch and so I got over it quickly. He asked me to “wait for him” because he really wanted us to be together, and so I did. Basically, around February 2020, I can say we officially became a couple and we’ve been together since then. Due to the pandemic, we didn’t see each other for a couple of months, but we still texted and called almost every day. After our lockdown period was over, we visited each other every day, we went on a few hiking trips, we then moved in together at the beginning of 2021 and we’ve been living together ever since.

What happened in the last few years: His dream since high school was to move abroad. I knew that since we first met, so it was something I was expecting to happen, but did not know when or how it would happen. After finishing Uni, he started working on the needed papers to get his diploma recognized in the country he wanted to move to, and that took quite a while (almost 2 years). While he was preparing for an exam he needed to take, his father didn’t feel well and he had to take him to the doctor and investigate. His father was diagnosed with a form of cancer, and they quickly moved and performed surgery to remove it. We were happy we got it diagnosed and treated so quickly, but we were still reserved. After 6 months, the tumor came back, this time they were multiple tiny ones, and so they started another form of treatment and he was fine. He lived his life normally, went to his job, did his hobbies, there wasn’t anything he would normally have done that he couldn’t with this ongoing problem. This went well for more than an year, until this spring, when they discovered multiple tumors in his spine. He couldn’t walk as well anymore, he was in a lot of pain, he got surgery and then his situation just got worse and worse until the end of spring, when his dad unfortunately passed away. While all of these issues with his dad happened, he got his license recognized in other countries, he did go abroad and started his first job, he quit that job because he had quite a few colleagues who were HR nightmares, then moved to a second job, started there and then had to take a leave of absence due to his dad’s worsening health. After his dad’s passing, he remained home for a few more months to solve all the legal issues, and then we both left our home country to go back to his workplace. Throughout this time, I was there and supported him in whatever way I was capable of, I visited him when he first moved abroad and at his second place of work (we didn’t have anything rented yet so I could only stay a limited amount of time with him in an Airbnb or other similar accommodations). I did have to live alone quite some time back home, but we still texted, FaceTimed every day, we would usually fall asleep on the phone together. When it came to going back abroad, I promised this time we would leave at the same time and I would stay with him and offer him the support he needed to properly adjust to working, being away from home, being away from his widowed mother and to process the grief he was going through.

Now that we’re in the present time, you might judge me as an asshole for thinking of breaking up with a man who I seemingly have loved for so many years, have had a committed relationship for half of the time we’ve known each other, who I’m living with, even moved abroad with, and who just recently lost one of his biggest supporters in life, his father, whom he had an excellent relationship with. The thing is, I wouldn’t blame you, because that’s what **I**’ve been thinking about myself as well. This is the reason why I can’t properly see for myself if I actually have some ground to stand on and make this decision or if I am just a selfish prick who doesn’t see that someone who’s going through a really tough time needs some help and I can’t just have the patience needed to offer him.

So, what are the reasons I am considering this option, you ask? Here’s a list of the things that have rung as alarm bells for me, before and during our relationship:

1.     *The ghosting/standing up*. When we were in lockdown (so there was nowhere to go), he would not reply to me for hours, and if I tried to call, he wouldn’t pick up the phone. The only time we would talk on the phone would be at the end of the day, before we went to sleep, for a maximum of 30 minutes, and, as I said, his texts were quite sporadic as well. Not only that, but there have been multiple times when we had established a date a few days prior and like… one hour before we were to meet, he would just text me, excusing himself that he couldn’t come anymore.

2.     *The white little lies/lies of omission*. I’m not the only person who he’s done it to and I can sense when he does them. He says little lies about what he’s done or where he went to, and in fact, it was completely innocent and normal things that he was up to. The biggest one is actually an example from his ex – he omitted to say they were together to his friends basically for the entire duration of their relationship. People basically deduced they were together, but he wouldn’t explicitly say it. He went to the length of booking separate bedrooms and shared them with friends of the same gender instead of sleeping together when they went on trips with their group of friends together. (He didn’t do the same with me, he did present me to his friends and we’ve always shared the same room when we went on trips even with other people, so that’s that.) But the one that stood out to me most recently, and is actually the reason I started writing this post, is that he omitted to tell me he went out multiple times with a colleague of his when I wasn’t in town at the beginning of this year and even went and visited some of *her* friends in that same time period. You wonder how I found out? I met said colleague this time around and *she* was the one who started telling some stories from the times they met up in their free time, thinking that I would know about them. When I confronted him about why he hid these meet-ups from me, he told me that “they were irrelevant”, because he didn’t know if he would come back to the same workplace after he came home for his dad, and he knew it would be better to not tell me, because I might have started having a “jealousy crisis”.

3.     *The inappropriate boundaries with female friends*. Okay, this one is quite problematic, because you could argue I was in that position as well. And yes, I was, but I knew that I had to respect certain boundaries to maintain my friendship. I didn’t try to budge him about my feelings towards him, I did sense he had a relationship and so I was more lowkey with my texts and hanging out with him. I didn’t even try to kiss him when it was really obvious he was into me. I’ve asked him if he felt any time that I was disrespecting those boundaries and he assured me I did not. The thing is that I can't say quite the same with some of his female friends. There’s one in particular who I know has always liked him, they even went on a few dates back in high school (I’ve only recently found out this important detail, **like 2 months ago**), and who has met up with the both of us but constantly talks about the time he visited her in the country she was for Uni, and how they spent that time together, and she always wears inappropriate clothing (almost flashed the both of us a few times) and touches him in some ways that make me sort of uncomfortable. There’s only one time that he explicitly told her to not try anything, when we’ve already been together for a few months and she invited him to her house when she was alone, to spend the week with her there (she was in another city than us). But these behaviors are things I’ve noticed recently going on. This colleague I’ve mentioned as well, he told me he thinks she kinda likes him, but he doesn’t do anything about it, he doesn’t say anything, doesn’t impose any boundaries, and he has done the same with other female colleagues or friends he has had. He basically likes letting them exist in this ambiguous state, because I think he enjoys the attention and the idea of being attractive to these women. The only female friend who I can definitely say has amazing boundaries around him is his ex, actually, who I’ve befriended and with whom we’ve went on multiple double dates with her partner as well. (Also, for those asking, I have male friends for myself as well, but I've always made my boyfriend and them meet as soon as possible, I've talked about them openly, I've always told him when I've met up with them, and if he called while I was out with them, I would always reply and even give the phone to my friend to say ""hi"" to my boyfriend as well. He, on the other hand, has had a few times where he met with said female friend that I didn't know of until after the fact.)

4.     *The boundaries with his mother*. This is even more complicated, but there is just something about the way he interacts with his mother that makes me feel uneasy. Basically all major decisions, even the ones that have included me directly, have been taken with his mother and I was basically informed of them. (Most recent example: I was basically told that we're supposed to pack up our things and move them all to his parent's house from the apartment they own, but we've lived in for the last few years, because his mother wants to rent it as quickly as possible, even though we still have not found a place of our own to rent abroad yet. Also, I found out she went a few days ago to our apartment to help packing up a few more things we have there, although there's stuff I haven't got to organizing and sorting through yet; it just doesn't feel right to me for her to be going through my/our things without even asking for consent or knowing what I'd like to keep and pack or what I'd like to donate.) He talks every day, multiple times a day on the phone and FaceTime. He basically wakes up and calls her, gets ready for work, goes there, gets out of work and instantly calls her. Only after that, he comes home, and in the evening he calls her and there’s been a few times where he basically fell asleep with her on the phone. The physical intimacy he offers her, as well, is extremely similar to what he does with me, as in the way he kisses my forehead, or caresses me. Basically the only difference in the way he acts in this matter around her and me is he doesn’t kiss her on the lips, which always makes me feel icky.

5.     *The physical intimacy*. Yes, it had to be mentioned, but it is a problem. The first time we tried to have physical intimacy, he wouldn’t let me do anything the way I was comfortable, I had to basically perform medical roleplay straight out of the gate. You can imagine how much performance anxiety I got, after so many years of waiting for and fantasizing about that moment. Nothing eventually happened because I was too anxious and he couldn’t get himself to do anything. He didn’t want to do anything with me in the first six months of our relationship (neither of us were virgins), but after we moved in together we basically had a period of 5 months when things went great and then it all became extremely repetitive and boring. He doesn’t want to do foreplay and I have to beg to have a few minutes of it just so I can warm up. His way of initiating is just to tell me to change in a specific article of clothing and he just expects me to become horny after that. On top of it all, our intimacy has decreased to the point that nothing happened between us since last winter, but I know that he still has a sexual drive because I've found proof of it unintentionally. All these things together make me feel extremely insecure if he even finds me attractive or that he has ever found me attractive. To add to the point, besides our first kiss, we basically haven’t properly kissed ever since. He only does quick pecks on the lips and that’s it. For the last 5 years...

6.     *His directness, bordering on insults*. He always tells a story about how direct he is, of the time I bought a crop top and I showed him my new buy without a bra on. His reaction was: “I hope you’re only wearing that in the house, ‘cause it looks like a piece of fabric you could clean the floors with.” Next day, after I’ve already decided to throw it away, he tells me to put it back on to show his mother what it was about, and this time (after I put a bra on as well), he says “oh, it actually looks nice, you can keep it!” It’s a story he’s told every single person who’s met us and it always is very funny to him and the other person.

7.     *His temper*. Besides the usual road-rage, which I am guilty of myself sometimes, there have been quite a few times, especially in the last few years, when he’s gotten angry and he started violently screaming and then throwing punches to the wall or other things. He once was so angry he broke the glass pane of the kitchen door, he had to get a few stiches and get the door fixed. He does this even in the presence of his mother, so I’m not the only person who he’s done this in front of, and there’s only a couple of times he was really angry **at** me and he shouted loud at me about it, but I still do not feel safe when he does that, especially because he knows I come from a family with a lot of emotional and psychological abuse, including verbal abuse, lots of shouting, and even physical abuse, so it really makes me clam up and get extremely anxious.

8.     *Having problems with talking about the relationship*. Whenever I bring up a problem I find in our relationship in order to solve it together, he finds a way to either deflect and make it a problem that I actually have or he gets irritated with the fact that we have to discuss that thing, especially if it’s in the evening (although that’s usually the only time I get to actually spend time with him and get to talk about important things). Even when I talk about it on the weekends, in the middle of the day, he gets frustrated the we had to “waste away 1 hour of our lives” to talk about a ""simple issue that I’ve invented"" or that actually comes from something I took ""the wrong way"". Yes, that includes talks about all the things I’ve mentioned here, and it especially enrages him if I want to talk about intimacy, because this has, apparently, become my “obsession”.

I think there may be other small things I could add, but at the time, I’m quite tired from writing this all out, to be honest. To give you an answer to something I think you might ask yourselves: no, these behaviors have ***not*** appeared only **after** his dad’s diagnosis or after he started the process of moving abroad for work. These things have shown in small quantities and much milder intensity before that as well, but yes, they **did** become worse and more frequent since these two problems arrived in our lives, and especially after his dad’s passing.

Due to that, I’m really confused if these are genuine red flags that are deal-breakers or just a bunch of yellow to red flags that yeah, they are unpleasant, but due to the fact that he’s going through quite a lot of stress, they could go away with time and healing and they could let us have a normal and fulfilling relationship in the long run. Is this just a way he mishandles his emotions during this turbulent period?

I am here for any kind of questions or additional context that may be needed. I am ready to accept whatever your opinions may be. If you consider me a selfish person, I get it. I am looking for a therapist right now anyway, so hopefully I will be able to work through whatever problems come up in that setting. If you think these are genuine issues, would you stay or would you leave?

Thank you to everyone on here that posts.  Here are some of my experiences. I would take a pass on San Jose unless you have a lot of time and are looking for something else to do.  We did stay in the Hotel Grano de Oro in San Jose and would recommend it if you are staying there or using San Jose as a base.  The best part of the trip involved our private driver from Costa Rica Driver, Danny (WhatsApp 011-506-8854-5969).  He was amazing and I left the planning to him.  We went to the Sarapiqui River on a boat tour (excellent btw to see tons of wildlife), did an aerial tram across to the top of rainforest (personally I am not a big fan of heights but it was not an issue and in fact very relaxing), went to Poas Volcano (spectacular views as it was completely clear sky), went La Paz Waterfall (beautiful), and finished things off with a tour of the Doka Coffee estate.  Raymundo was our guide and he was incredible.  I have to say the extra knowledge and insight we received from both Danny and Raymundo during the trip was outstanding.  Bottom line:  I would completely recommend a private driver and skip San Jose.

Still have a lot of old stuff from our college days but looking to slowly upgrade as we save up money. 

I’m thinking - anything I sit on (chairs, bar stools, mattress, etc.) has to be high quality for comfort and durability. I’m ok with spending $1000+ on a couch/mattress, or $300+ on a chair. 

But everything else.. like rugs, curtains, console/coffee tables, artwork, lamps… is it ok to go with cheaper or mid-range stuff from Target, Home Depot, Costco, Amazon, Wayfair, IKEA?

I know thrifting from FB marketplace or estate sales is another option too, but I’m looking to take advantage of upcoming Black Friday sales to get a few more things done around the house. I’ve been to a few of the more nice brands like Restoration Hardware, Room & Board, or local designer furniture stores, but every time I see a piece of furniture over $2000 I think my money would be better spent on taking a vacation 🥲  

Any advice? Will I regret going cheap on some of these things?",3,1730040429.0,homeowners,23,1.0,False

The entire time he has been with me he has never had any potty issues with not using the litter box. In February he was diagnosed with diabetes after some steroids he took for an acute illness. This means he is no longer able to be free fed and just be regimented with his insulin doses until (hopefully) the diabetes resolves. He is fed 4 small meals throughout the day through an automatic wet food dispenser. This is where the litter box comes in. He still religiously pees in one of the boxes, there are multiple in different locations (1 opened and 1 closed). But now in the morning when he decides it is time to get up or he thinks he should get more food he has started pooping beside the bed, or in front of the bathroom door or behind the couch. It all depends on where I am. He will give you about a 2 minute warning where he will meow really loudly and directly and if you aren’t at attention for his demands he is pooping right there. Sometimes I am sleeping, sometimes getting ready for work, sometimes having coffee on the couch. The location is always in relation to where I am at the moment. This is really not fun because who wants to pick up turds every morning or be woken up by the smell. But also I live in an apartment and he is meowing LOUD.  He has seen the vet. She says this is not diabetes related but behavioral. He is already eating more than recommended servings, he cannot have more.

What are my options?","I started on a low 10mg dose of generic Adderall a few months ago and had no change whatsoever. My doctor increased my dose to 20mg. For about two weeks I felt no change, but instantly during the third week one day it hit hard and with many of the negative side effects. Random pings of anxiety (extremely abnormal for me), loss of appetite, and terrible sleep every night.

After this, my doctor reduced me to 15mg and again there is no change with maybe the occasional short-lived spurt of productivity. But I can tell it's not lasting long (an hour or two), and most days I feel nothing at all. I've purposely cut back to one cup of coffee a day while taking the medication but feel at this points its still the only thing that helps even a little bit.

I'm very much still experimenting but if 20mg is too much and 15mg is too little, are there other options for something in between? Another medication that works the same as the 20mg but with less side effects? Or maybe a medication I take more times throughout the day?

Or rather, she helped him back into the car once he was himself again, and she drove them back into town, back over to her building. Still, he was with her, slumped and pale in the passenger seat, muttering apologies.

When they pulled to a stop, she killed the engine and looked over at him.

""Come upstairs,"" she said, ""and lay down a while.""

So, he staggered out of the car, and she crawled out after him, and they walked up to the apartment. Liz was out of town again, and Oak had left a note on the coffee table saying he was off with the laundry and would run over to Zedrick's on the way back. Pizza for dinner.

Hannah got Kai settled on her bed, stripping him down to his underwear and covering him with the light quilt she had just pulled out two days ago when she felt the autumn chill setting in.

Kai was asleep almost immediately. He had, in his fragmented babblings during the drive back, said that it was not usually so bad, doing at will the act he had shown her, but that he rarely did it so close to ""the moon.""

For an instant, she went and sat on the sofa, but then she changed her mind and drifted to the kitchen. There was still a half-bottle of not-too-terrible vodka in the freezer, and so she poured herself a little bit in a juice glass and slugged it back painfully.

She felt pretty insane at the moment. What she had seen... What Kai had done, had ***been***...

It had to be fake. Maybe he was not the good guy he had made himself out to be and somehow, he had dosed her with something to make her hallucinate. Of course, if he had, it had worked incredibly briefly.

It was crazy to think that Kai was something like what they'd seen in that movie on their first date. That somewhere inside him was a literal animal. Crazy. Insane. Impossible. And yet...

She went over and pulled down the wall calendar, flipping back to the month of that first date. She remembered how they had decided when to go out, how she had suggested later in the week, but he had begged off; he was busy through the weekend.

That Thursday had been a full moon.

She flipped through the rest of summer. The only other full moon that coincided with a ""usual"" date night for them had been in June. A Saturday. Most of the other times he had to reschedule things, it was usually work stuff or family stuff, so he said.

But then, if she was not crazy and had really seen what she thought she had, Kai at least could turn into a wolf at will. Was he the only one, or were all the Corwins like him? Did they have regular big get-togethers, like some half-civilized wolf pack? A nice family dinner, some idle chit-chat, and then a run through the night, guised as animals?

Pinning the calendar back in place, she stalked back our through the living room and over to her bed, determined to wake Kai up and demand some kind of answers. Was it real? Was this some dumb gag?

When she got there, he was awake, sitting up on the edge of the bed, looking shaky.

""Hey,"" he rasped.

""Hey,"" she said.

""So. Let's talk.""

I (36f) am an American expat living in Europe. I met my husband (41m) 3.5 years ago. We are living in a multi unit complex that he has just completed. His brother (47m) occupies the unit next to us. 

Today, like many Sundays, his brother came over for coffee. We all had our coffee normal conversation and then the topic of what needed to be finished. We just got new furniture and carpets and it’s finally feeling like home to me. I requested an exhaust fan in the bathroom. The units below us all have them, and I think it’s necessary to avoid humidity within the house. The two of them went to the bathroom to decide the best way to do this. I stayed in the living room and could hear them discussing the fan.

At some point I hear BIL say, “can I ask you for a favor?” And they step into my bedroom further away from me. Then I hear the two of the switch to their native language so I don’t understand a thing. I was really tempted to yell “hey what you’re doing is rude, no secrets in my house!” But I felt like I was out of place. I waited until BIL left and I asked my husband what was the favor and why did he feel the need to switch languages to keep me from understanding? His response was that BIL met a girl 6 months ago, from their native country but he’s embarrassed to share that with me. Regardless of my feelings, here’s the real issue. 

BIL saw how nice our house is, and asked while we’re in America for the holidays,  if he could stay here in our home with her. Maybe I’m overreacting but I’m not cool with a stranger in my home while I’m away.  We just furnished the house and literally 4 days later of feeling like this is my home I’m expected to leave it like an Airbnb. How do I approach this? 

My husband said that I don’t want to help my BIL find a partner. I think this bullshit. He has the means to rent a hotel or an Airbnb. I’m happy to have the girl stay in guest room when we are there but I can’t have people in my home without me there. It just doesn’t sit well with me. 

I asked for the key back to our apartment (we don’t have one for his) and it was the end of the world. What am I supposed to do? ",2,1730040173.0,relationshipadvice,2,0.75,False

Overwhelmed by my sudden rush of emotions, I hurried downstairs before he could leave the closet, trying to appear busy. I grabbed a cloth and began wiping the kitchen counter, even though it was spotless.

 

A minute passed, and I heard him come down the stairs. Keeping my back to him, I continued cleaning, hoping to avoid any interaction. Relief washed over me when I heard the front door open and close. He didn’t say anything.

 

I needed a job—something to save up for law school in Seattle. I remembered a café just down the street. Maybe it was time to venture out and try my luck there.

 

I pulled on a light purple sleeveless top with thin straps, paired it with my favorite jeans, and tied my hair into a high ponytail. Grabbing my phone, I stepped outside for the first time since I arrived.

 

The fresh air was a welcome change, and a gentle breeze tickled my skin as I walked down the street. The overcast sky mirrored my mood, but for a moment, I found comfort in the simple beauty of it all. Soon, I arrived at the café: Love & Coffee.

 

Suppressing the urge to judge the name, I took a deep breath and pushed the glass door open. The warm scent of coffee and pastries enveloped me, instantly soothing my nerves. The café’s simple elegance, with its white and brown décor, felt inviting.

 

The counter was busy, but I managed to squeeze into the line. When it was my turn, I approached the girl taking orders. “Excuse me,” I stammered, “I’m...looking for a part-time job. Could I...speak to the manager?”

Her understanding smile eased my anxiety. “Hang on, I’ll get the owner for you.”

 

A minute later, she returned with a man following behind her. He appeared to be in his mid-twenties, with messy dark curls and striking green eyes. Dressed in black from head to toe, he wore a warm smile.

 

He led me to a table and gestured for me to sit. “So, you’re looking for a job?” His voice was friendly, his tone casual.

 

“Yes,” I replied, struggling to steady my nerves. “I really need one. I don’t have much experience, but I’m a fast learner and willing to do anything.”

 

A waiter appeared with two glasses of water, and he slid one toward me with a soft chuckle. “Relax. Drink some water first. You look nervous.”

As a baby I had severe acid reflux and would projectile vomit the majority of my meals. I don't know much about what my parents did to get rid of that issue, but I know that it went away after a few months. I never had an issue with vomiting or nausea again until three and a half years ago, when I started college early at 16 years old. I was studying and drinking my first coffee when I started to feel incredibly nauseous. I could feel my jaw and cheeks burning/tasting sour, my throat was making a noise like a stomach growling, and I began collecting pools of what I assume to be acid in my mouth. I assumed I was having a bad reaction to the caffeine because I had never had espresso before, and I waited to inevitably throw up. However, after sitting in pain like this for an hour without throwing up, I finally gagged myself and forced out the vomit. 

This situation started to occur more and more frequently; it started as something that would occur every few weeks, but by finals season, it was happening at least once a day. I saw a doctor and they diagnosed it as acid reflux and prescribed me a medication. I wish I could remember the names of the medications I've tried, but there have been so many over the past few years, all with 0 effect, that I can't remember a single one. I remember I was put on a pill prescribed to cancer patients dealing with nausea due to chemotherapy and it didn't have the slightest impact. Then, the doctors suggested changing up my diet. I stopped drinking anything other than water, I tried eating slower, I tried eating smaller portions, I tried cutting out processed foods— no change. I even tried not eating at all for a day and a half, but I still got nauseous and vomited bile. Moreover, I don't believe I have any food intolerances because I never experience stomach pain or bloating.

  
Then, I started to consider anxiety as the cause of my nausea. Whenever I'm stressed or anxious the nausea comes on, which created a vicious cycle of me being anxious about getting nauseous, and then getting nauseous because of that. Also, my nausea never actually causes me to vomit involuntarily. I always forced myself to vomit to stop the nausea, and the relief I felt from getting rid of that gurgling-sour-stinging-throat feeling was such a relief that it kind of felt like purging away my stress. The feeling of vomiting started to be associated with such good feelings that I would force myself to vomit whenever I was upset, regardless of whether I was nauseous. I've stopped that now, though. However, even when I was out of school for the summer and had weeks of relaxation, these symptoms still persisted (although not as frequent, maybe just once a week). So, I don't know if it could be related to anxiety. 

One final development: I've realized that if I gag myself just enough to violently burp a few times, I can get rid of the nausea without having to vomit. For context, I've never been able to burp naturally. So, is all of this literally just because I can't burp? I'm not sure, because this problem is relatively recent and I drank a lot of soda as a kid before this problem existed, and I processed it just fine without burping. 

  
This was way too long, but I felt like I needed more info since I've been working with other doctors for 3 years who don't know how to solve this either. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!

  
TL;DR I have frequent nausea so bad I force myself to throw up. Could be acid reflux, eating habits, anxiety, or not burping— could also be none of those. Please help!",1,1730039951.0,AskDocs,4,1.0,False

- Lady fingers (depends on how many layers you want or what could fit your tray)
- 3 shots of espresso or strong coffee brew
- 500g mascarpone (i used 2x 250g small tubs; see pictures)
- 4 egg yolk (medium-large eggs)
- 1 cup sugar
- unsweetened fine cocoa powder

*note that if youre doing this in big tray, add two more yolks for every tub of mascarpone and a half cup of sugar
*better to make your coffee first before you build the tiramisu

Instructions:

- break the egg and separate the yolks in a mixing bowl and mix it with a cup of sugar on med speed until its smooth and fluffy
- add 250g of mascarpone (break it before you put it in the yolk mix for easy ) mix on med speed then add the other 250g of the mascarpone; mix it until smooth and fluffy (optional for robust flavor; add 2 tbsp of coffee) then chill
- after its chilled; put a thin layer of the mascarpone on the bottom of the tray for a stable layer of the biscuits
- dip (DO NOT SOAK) each lady fingers and line them up accordingly and then layer it with the mascarpone mix. Depending how much you want to layer this is completely up to you but my recommendation, 2 layers is enough.
- top it with another layer of mascarpone and chill it for 3 hrs (DO NOT PUT THE COCO POWDER YET)

Upon serving, this is where you seal the surface off with the coco powder, dont be afraid to sprinkle and coat every corner of the tiramisu.

The afternoon drifted into a quiet hum of activity as the café began to fill up. Atlas sent me out to serve water to the new arrivals, and I was so focused on not spilling a single drop that I didn’t even glance up at the table.

As I placed the glasses down, a voice broke through my concentration—one I hadn’t heard in years. ""Drea?""

My heart stuttered. There, standing before me, was Adrian. After all these years. Alive. My throat tightened as emotion surged. ""Adrian?""

Tears stung my eyes as we stared at each other, neither of us daring to move, still trying to grasp the reality that he was standing there, whole and unharmed.

“Drea!"" He quickly stepped forward, gripping my hand as if afraid I might vanish. ""I can't believe you're here!""

He was back. After three long years of wondering, worrying, and sleepless nights, he was really here. My mind raced with a thousand questions, emotions twisting inside me.

""You should be saying that to me! You disappeared without a word!"" My voice wavered, an odd mix of anger, relief, and disbelief. ""I didn't have your number, I didn't know if you were okay. I thought—""

He cut me off, guilt written all over his face. ""I know, I know. I'm sorry. I left without saying anything because I didn’t want to drag you into my mess.”

“Messed up?” I scoffed, hurt and frustration boiling over. ""I lost my best friend, Adrian. I was alone!""

His head dropped, and he whispered, ""I’m so sorry, Drea. I promise, I’m not going anywhere again.""

The soft clearing of a throat interrupted us, and I realized we weren’t alone. A woman sat nearby, cradling a baby boy in her arms, and a little girl perched next to her, wide-eyed and curious. They all watched us with mild curiosity.

Adrian looked over and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Oh, right. Drea, this is my wife, Darcy. And these are my kids—Isla and Josh.”

I blinked, trying to process the words. His wife? Kids? “Oh... hi,” I managed, giving them an awkward wave. Darcy smiled warmly, while Isla waved back with the enthusiasm only a child could muster.

“It’s Isla’s third birthday today,” Adrian added with a soft chuckle.

“Happy Birthday, Isla,” I said gently, though my mind was racing.

Isla’s face lit up. “Thank you! Are you Aunt Drea? Daddy told us all about you!”

I shot Adrian a confused glance. Aunt Drea?

Adrian grinned. “Yes, Isla. This is Aunt Drea.”

Before I could react further, I heard Atlas calling me back to the kitchen, pulling me away from the whirlwind of emotions I was feeling.

“I’ll catch up with you later, Adrian,” I said hurriedly, dashing back inside.

The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur, with Adrian’s family lingering for Isla’s birthday cake. We exchanged polite smiles, but I knew we needed more time to really talk about everything that had happened. There was too much to say, too many questions I still had.

Hours later, after my shift had ended, I stepped out of the café and mentally kicked myself. I’d forgotten to get Adrian’s number. Again. How could I be so ridiculous? After all these years, I still hadn’t managed to ask for his contact details.

Just as I was internally scolding myself, I collided with someone outside.

“Drea,” a familiar voice called out, and I looked up to see Adrian standing in front of me, his expression soft and warm. “I was just coming to see you.”

“Adrian?” I blinked, surprised. “I thought you left hours ago.”

He shrugged, that boyish smile of his spreading across his face. “I did. But I came back because we still have a lot to talk about.”

I nodded, my heart pounding. “Yeah, we do.”

“Want to take a walk?”

Without thinking, I agreed. We strolled through the streets, avoiding any route near my house. I didn’t want Sorin to know about this. Not yet.

“So…” Adrian’s voice cut through the silence, a teasing note in his tone. “You got married.”

I shot him a sideways glance. “How do you know?”

“Really? It was all over the news. Didn’t you see it?”

I fiddled with my fingers, nerves bubbling to the surface. “Oh…”

He laughed softly, shaking his head. “Yeah. To Sorin Zaveri, no less. I was shocked but also happy for you. You’ve always loved him, Drea. Seems like your dream came true.”

His excitement was palpable, but his words only made my chest tighten. I couldn’t lie to him. Not after everything we’d been through.

I swallowed hard and stopped walking, staring down at my feet. “It’s not real, Adrian.”

His brow furrowed as he halted beside me. “What do you mean?”

“It’s just… a business deal,” I whispered, feeling the weight of the truth crash down. “My parents married me off to save their company. Sorin hates me.”

Adrian’s expression darkened, his hands balling into fists. “Drea…”

I wiped at my eyes, fighting back the tears. “I’m okay, Adrian. I am. I’ve learned to deal with it.”

His jaw clenched. “If I’d been here, I would have taken you away. I wouldn’t have let this happen.”

I placed a gentle hand on his arm. “It’s not your fault. You couldn’t have known.”

After a long silence, Adrian offered to walk me home, but I declined. The last thing I needed was Sorin seeing us together and making assumptions.

When I finally reached the house, I tried to unlock the door, but the code wouldn’t work. Sorin had changed it. I knocked several times, but there was no response. Defeated, I sat down on the doorstep, scrolling through old photos of him. His smile in those pictures always made my heart ache.

Suddenly, his voice startled me. “What are you doing out here?”

I jumped, my phone slipping from my grasp. Sorin stood over me, his face unreadable as he bent to pick it up. He glanced at the screen, which displayed a picture of him, and his expression changed—though I couldn’t quite tell how.

Without a word, he handed my phone back. “Why didn’t you just come inside?”

“The door… it wouldn’t open,” I stammered.

Sorin frowned, stepping forward to test the lock. After a moment, he sighed in frustration. “Did you try using your fingerprint?”

I bit my lip, guilt written all over my face.

He sighed. “Unbelievable. Now we’re locked out.” He pulled out his phone, pacing away to make a call for help.

When he returned, he sat down beside me, though he made sure to keep some distance. The silence between us stretched on as we waited for someone to fix the lock, and I couldn’t help but sneak a glance at him.

I wished, just for once, he’d let me in—both literally and figuratively.

Globalisation - process through which ideas and activities of people living in different parts of the world become interconnected.

Interconnections - links created or established among people, businesses and countries through the movement of goods, services, people, knowledge and resources.

Interdependence - developments in the world and developments in a specific place affect one another.

Speed:

1830 : Steam-powered rail travel which covers a distance of 50km at a speed of 48km/h.

Since 1964 : Bullet trains cover a distance of around 3478km at a speed of 320km/h.

Capacity:

1800s : Steam-powered ships have limited capacity as a lot of space is taken up by its large engine and fuel.

Since 1956 : Depending on their size, container ships have a carrying capacity ranging from 25 000 to 600 000 tonnes. 

Costs: 

1950s : Flying was a luxury and only few people could afford it.

Since 1990s : With the rise of low costs airlines, cost of flights decreased. With lower airfares, more people can afford air travel.

Advancements in transportation also includes development of supporting infrastructure eg highways, railways and airports. Transport services have become more readily available and affordable. All these developments have also contributed towards the acceleration of globalisation, leading to a ”shrinking world” as people, goods and services are able to move around the world more quickly, in larger volumes, at lower costs. Business activities and ideas are thus becoming more interconnected and interdependent globally.

Long distance communications have developed from smoke signals, postal letters, telephones, to smartphones. Smartphones enable people to engage in a plethora of functions beyond making calls, able to communicate with one another across different time zones and over various distances via instant video calls using their smartphones.

Developments in digital technology have rapidly improved communications and accelerated globalisation. They have enabled people to stay connected, share information and ideas, and do business across vast distances and different time zones.

Multinational corporations (MNCs) : Starbucks

Coffee beans are sourced from more than 30 countries eg US, Africa, Asia -> transported to roasting facilities in different countries eg US, India -> warehouses pack and store roasted coffee for distribution to retailers -> Starbucks distributed to more than 35 000 stores globally in 2022.

MNCs may operate in different countries due to advantages eg affordable supple of raw materials or labour, right skills at lower costs.

When MNCs set up subsidiaries in other countries, they increase interconnections between people, activity and goods globally and facilitate exchange of ideas between countries. Thus MNCs drive globalisation as more interdependent and interconnected relationships are established.",4,1730039581.0,SGExams,6,0.83,False
1gdcamy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsthemoviecalled/comments/1gdcamy/movie_possibly_spanishitalian_drama_with_a_gay/,Movie (possibly Spanish/Italian drama) with a gay story where the boyfriend attends dinner and punches his partner's father. ,"Some months ago, I was scrolling mindlessly on Instagram, and I watched this reel about a dinner scene in a restaurant. The caption explained that it was time for the character X to introduce his boyfriend to his parents. The dinner setting is formal, with men wearing coats and the mother wearing gowns. 

Here, my memory got blurred; it's either the father trying to pour something on his son's head, possibly coffee, and the boyfriend interferes, pushing the cup away, and hence the liquid fell to the floor instead, and then the boyfriend punches the father. The reel ends.

Another possibility is that the father seems restless, angry, and, after some exchange with his son, gets angry and proceeds to stand, his hand ready to slap his son, but the boyfriend interferes and punches the father instead.

The main thing is, in that scene the father got punched by the younger character, who did that to protect his partner. 

I remember the faces were Spanish or Latin, but its also possible that the actors were Italian. From the setting and the scene, it seems that it is either a Netflix production, a series by other producers, or a tragedy movie.

Could the community help me in identifying what movie is this? Its lingering on my head and I could not get away from it.",1,1730039578.0,whatsthemoviecalled,1,1.0,False

Husband and I have dabbled in the swinger lifestyle for awhile. Never worked out great because it was so hard to find a compatible couple. We go to a swinger party a few weeks ago and meet this amazing couple. They are new to the lifestyle and have never played with new people but very sexually open and inquisitive. We didn’t play that night, just talked. We exchanged contacts and started a group chat. After talking more about the possibilities we all discovered that we all were into seeing each other’s partner separately as well as seeing everyone in the group on a semi regular bases. Whenever our schedules can align, we want to meet up. We are open to playing all together in the same room, mfm, fmf, solo dates, group vacations, even the possibility of our kids meeting.

I have a great texting relationship with the other husband and my husband actually went for a date night with his wife this weekend, which went great. I haven’t experienced any jealous feelings but have had to work through a few things in my head as this progresses. Nothing bad, just weird. We all talk constantly about how crazy this is and it literally feels like we won the lottery that we didn’t buy a ticket for. I went to coffee with the other wife and we hit off. I would consider her a friend and enjoy her company even if we weren’t in this relationship situation. 

I guess I am looking for all the newbie advice, tips and tricks. Is there a book we should all read specific to our dynamic? What is this dynamic even called? We all want to have a very solid foundation so that we can make this work long term. We are very considerate and respectful with each others feelings and are constantly checking in with one another. We have made it clear that there is a hierarchy and marriages come first. Another rule is that we always know when the others are meeting, this may change in the future as we build a deeper connection and trust. Our messages with one another are also an open book if the spouse wants to read them. We all are open to reading more about the lifestyle and genuinely want to do this the right way if that exists. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and I will share with the rest of the group. ",5,1730039490.0,polyamory,16,0.73,False

1gdc4r2,https://www.reddit.com/r/MAOIs/comments/1gdc4r2/maoispramipexole_for_trd/,MAOIS+Pramipexole for TRD,"I've seen and printed several studies and articles that shows how Pramipexole can be very effective for TRD, the stats has a adjunct seems to be better then anything else.
I'm on a combo of meds, probably too much but just want to mention i'm on PARNATE for about the last year.
I precise that because often people will say did you tried PARNATE because of it's effect on Dopamine.
I tried for dopamine Nardil, Wellbutrin, low dose of Abilify, they didn't work, and about 40 different meds over the years
I'm also on 175mgs of SEROQUEL( maybe my base meds), i hate that meds because of it's side effects especially the exhaustion in the morning that can stay for a good 3 hours after i wake up even if i slept a good 8-10 hours. I known it also blocks dopamine at higher dosage.
So i wake up completly not functionnal, i just go and make myself a coffee and return to my room because i just can't speack to nobody, i'm so short temper,  basically i'm so tired i just lay in bed, not able to sleep just waiting for it to get better after about 3 hours.
So i'm still dealing with important residual symptoms of depression.
The main ones are fatigue, very low motivation and without any motivation it affects all the aspect of your life and create anxiety and depression.
So lately we tried stimulants, VYVANCE doest a great job, i wake up, take 1 and after half an hour i'm up, very social, in a good mood and ready to be productive.
It basically takes my depression away.
Only big problem, tolerance builds very fast for me, in about 10-15 days it doesn't work anymore and i'm getting probably even worse depression after and i have to take a breack or tried to reset my tolerance( probably 5-7 days) or swiching to CONCERTA but it's not that good for me.
So i feel stimulants are a double 
edged-sword and i think it potentially make more harm then good in the long run when use for depression. You get that big spike of dopamine and probably when the effects goes, my already low dopamine baseline even drops lower so i'm really not sure the trade off is worth it,
10 good days vs 7 bad days.
So i'm thinking if i respond that good to stimulants that a dopaminergic agent like Pramipexole could possibly work great for me.
My psy even precibed me PRAMIPEXOLE a few days ago without knowning anything about it for TRD, she has about 10 patients on it for RLS but the protocol for TRD is very different.
I even printed all the studies, highlighted all the important points of doctor Fawcett article. So i done the hardest part, research, print and then identified the major points and she didn't even take 5 minutes to check it out and just gave me a prescription and said i will print it and take a look at it later.
So i have the prescription but didn't go get it because of the major possible side effects like addictions and DAWS syndrome, so i still didn't make my mind on it yet.",2,1730039142.0,MAOIs,0,1.0,False
1gdc4p0,https://i.redd.it/d0miu07l6bxd1.jpeg,Book haul from Vietnam! 🇻🇳,"Ever since I visited Sydney, Australia which is a place known from their free street libraries and bookstores with great book selections, I made it a ‘habit’ then to include visiting bookstores in my itinerary on every countries I visited.

So here’s my book haul from Hanoi, Vietnam. I targeted only those bookstores with International books.

Here are the bookstores I visited ranked from what I highly reco:

1.	⁠The Bookshelf Hanoi - The booksellers can speak english and soooo nice! The prices are a bit lower than what I expect. I went back here on our last day and bought 3 more books!

2.	⁠Gac Xep Bookstore - they have good selection!!! Most affordable sa lahat ng napuntahan ko. They give 10k VND discount if you visit their store per book(?) because they do have online store too. Their store is hard to locate though. Bought book: Kindred

3.	⁠Bookworm Hanoi - they have preloved/used books but too expensive for me if you’ll compare the price on their brand new books. Around 50k VND diff. They also have bookish stuff and mini café inside but didn’t tried their coffee though. Biggest and more known bookstore in Hanoi. Only bought tote bag and a small notepad.

4.	⁠The Traveller’s Bookshop - mix of preloved and brand new books, all wrapped in OPP plastic but not in the most aesthetic way possible 😅. I found hard to find titles here. Didn’t bought anything though. Short in cash.",9,1730039138.0,PHBookClub,0,1.0,False

The windows were still black, but he was done sleeping.

Sweat cooling on his skin, he considered how sleeping next to Elaine hadn’t ever left him so scorched. Swinging knobby feet to the floor, he was shocked by iciness. Grunting, he shuffled to the bathroom — decades of routine motoring him. Brushing his teeth, he considered his reflection, not surprised by the old man staring back. Passing on a shave, he left the bathroom and remade the rumpled half of the bed. Pulling a cardigan over his t-shirt, Rory cautiously navigated the stairs. The kitchen was a mess of empty casserole dishes and takeout containers overflowed the trash. The dishes needed to be returned to sympathizers, he knew, but it wasn’t going to be today. 

And tomorrow, he thought, already felt futile.

Dropping a filter into the basket, Rory ground coffee left from the subscription Elaine purchased to support a local roaster during the pandemic.

A sob snorted out before he could stop it. Pounding a gnarled fist on the counter, he snarled “Enough already.” His voice, disused and rough, sounded muted in the small kitchen.

Pressing start on the coffee, he swore, realizing he’d made a full pot again.

Leaving the kitchen, Rory made his way to the living room to sit in his chair, joints protesting nosily as he sat down. Switching on the news, he immediately tapped mute. The coffee maker snorkeled as he stared through the television. Rory’s mind drifted the library of memory. The shelves of his library had been rich in variety, but were now laden with dark sections. Lonely places. Funerals. Her funeral.

Elaine had loved everyone and everyone had loved her.

Clammy. Hot. Hot and Clammy. Cold. Cold and Clammy. Hand after hand shook his in consolation. He’d kept getting distracted by how some squeezed softly with sympathy, others, though, latched aggressively as if clinging to debris in a shipwreck. They had words, too. Words Rory knew were well intended but made him angry rather than assured. The shoulder pats and sad eyes didn’t penetrate the depth of his loss.

As he’d stood graveside, gazing at the shiny box, he’d imagined crawling inside with her. 

He couldn’t, though. He’d promised.

Instead, duty drove him. He’d said words from a pulpit he loathed and words as mourners fled their collective fate.

In a church basement smelling of Play-Doh and musty hymnals with claustrophobically low ceilings, he’d said words as they chewed ham cheese sandwiches pushed down with fruit punch.

Expectations met, he’d begged forgiveness and departed. He’d felt hollow pitying eyes as he drove away.

He hadn’t gone home.

He’d gone back to where she lay.

He stepped from his car and a sob choked out. He swallowed it, shoving his hands into coat pockets. As Rory walked the manicured path he became aware of how much noise the crows were making. He’d looked up to see the leafless trees filled with black eyed birds staring at him. Judging him. He’d wanted to shout and make them leave, but just kept his head down, walking into hopelessness.

Making his way around a grove of young pines, Rory found Elaine.

Under dirt.

In the darkness.

Without him.

Standing there, looking at the mound of black dirt — the last remnant of the only love he’d ever known — he’d reached down, moaning, and pulled the small gold band from his finger, laying it gently on the cold headstone. Running his fingers over her name once, he’d stood and walked to his car, ignoring the crows.

The coffee maker began to chime.

Leveraging himself out of the chair, Rory walked back to the kitchen, rinsing out yesterday’s cup avoiding opening the cupboard.

She was in the cupboards.

She was the dish towels.

She was plates and bowls.

She was everything.

And she was gone.

Rory dropped his mug into the sink and sank to the floor. His old knees screamed. His back howled. None of it mattered. He made it to the floor, fell onto his side, and began to sob.

Never a hobbyist and now a retired widower, Rory found his days vacant. During his physical, Dr. Subramanian prodded Rory get out and socialize. As an olive branch, he’d started frequenting the local public library. Rory discovered he enjoyed the furniture and lighting of the library to that of his house.

He was tucked away in his favorite spot enjoying a novel when the library doors opened and, in, filed a line of young people. Rory guessed there were fifty and he could see the yellow bus out front. Smiling, he watched over his glasses as teachers wrangled the herd. Holding up two fingers, one teacher commanded their attention, handed out instruction, and finally dispersed them.

He and Elaine had been unable to have children and had celebrated each other, instead. Times like this, though, he wondered what it would’ve been like. He cut short the thought, determined to keep the library his sanctuary from grief. Rory turned his attention back to the novel.

About thirty minutes later, Rory’s attention was interrupted once more, this time by a small voice.

“Hi.”

Rory looked up, raising an eyebrow. Standing next to him was a child wearing OshKoshs over a light blue shirt. Her blond hair cut to a bob, her clear blue eyes looking at him without trepidation.

Clearing his throat lightly, he replied, “Hello there.”

“Can I ask you a question?”

“Sure, but I should tell you, I don’t work here.”

“Oh I know. You’re way too old to work here.”

Rory felt a smile pull the corner of his mouth. “Is that right?”

“Oh yeah. Look at Ms. Lee,” she turned slightly gesturing to the young librarian at the counter, “She’s like young. You’re not.”

“Observant. I can’t deny that,” he replied, openly grinning now. “You said you had a question?”

She paused, thoughtful, then her eyes lit up, “Oh yeah! Do you like birds?”

He noticed she had an armful of books related to the subject.

“I don’t have anything against them, I suppose,” he replied, reviewing the titles with tilt of the head.

“That’s not the same as liking them, I don’t think,” she said, continuing, “They’re my favorites. There’s so many and they’re all different and they’re everywhere.”

Amused, Rory asked, “Do you have a favorite kind of bird?”

Her expression turned serious. Creasing her forehead, she looked down at the stack in her arms. Setting her books on the table, she pulled over a small chair for herself, and began, “I have lots of favorites. I like Robins and Sparrows cuz there are so many, but I really like the woodpeckers. You know, the kind with the red heads. So cool. I like big birds like eagles and hawks, but I don’t get to see them much. They don’t like bird seed. They eat raw meat. Gross. But they're still cool. Owls are probably my favorites. Wait. No. I think I like hummingbirds most. I like a lot of birds,” she finished, a little winded.

“Sounds like you do. Are there any you don’t like?” Rory asked trying a different direction.

She paused to think, “Yeah... I don’t like dramasticated birds.”

“Pardon? What kind?” He asked, confused.

“Dramasticated. Like dogs and cats.”

“Oh!! Domesticated.”

“Yeah, that.”

“Got it. You don’t like pet birds,” he offered.

“Right,” she said and then, “They aren’t free.”

“That’s a good reason.”

“Can I ask another question?”

“Do I have a choice?” he replied with a grin.

“No. I already sat down.”

Enjoying this conversation even more now, Rory replied, “Well, since I don’t have a choice, ask your question.”

“Are you sad?”

His smile slipped slightly. The hurricane of loss lurking the edges of his mind picked up wind, but he said, “Oh, I get sad sometimes, sure, but then I meet smart folks like you and get to talk about birds.”

She was not so easily put off. Squinting slightly, she said, “I think you’re still sad even after talking about birds.”

“I am less sad, if that counts.” Rory replied.

She was unable to answer, though, as a teacher called out, “Meghan, what are you doing over here? You’re supposed to be getting books for class.” Rory turned slightly in his chair to see the teacher; an attractive young woman who clearly had no time for nonsense. She glanced at him apologetically and, with mild impatience, turned back to Meghan.

“I got my books, Ms. Stanton. I w’just waiting for the other kids to be done. I wanted to talk to this sad man about birds.”

Rory’s face reddened at the blunt observation.

“Well, it’s time to go, so let’s get your books together and meet at the front,” Ms. Stanton replied. She smiled uncertainly at Rory and then was striding to three students arguing over spots in line.

As Meghan began stacking her books, she pushed one toward Rory. “You should read this. These are sad birds. Maybe you can talk to each other.”

Rory looked down at the glossy cover and read, The Social Habits of Crows. “Well, thank you. I’ll take a look,” he said slipping into insincerity with the ease of age.

“You better,” she said, flashing a toothless grin, “I’ll ask you when I come back.”

“Meghan, let’s go,” Ms. Stanton called wearily. She turned before Rory could respond and scurried off with her books.

As the bus pulled away, Rory briefly glanced at the book she left but returned to his novel. After reading the same line several times, he glanced at the book on the table. Smirking, he put down his novel, opening the crow book.

The following morning Rory was in the garage looking for the items he needed for a feeding tray. Finding the supplies and tools prescribed in the book, he willed his gnarled hands to work. Locating a spot in his backyard, he set up the platform, placing a small mound of peanuts.

Exhausted and sore, Rory watched for crows to appear. After a moment, he laughed at himself. The book said it could take weeks before crows might appear. Resigning himself to patience, he went inside.

It was nearly a month before the first crow appeared. Closing the shades for the evening, he saw the bird, large and black with a peanut protruding from its beak, looking toward the window. Pausing to watch, Rory was struck by the power of its gaze. The crow cawed twice, vanishing into the sky. Rory giggled. Then he laughed, holding a hand to his chest, feeling his heart pounding. He couldn’t believe it had worked.

The crows began to frequent the platform with increasing numbers until, one day, Rory, returning from the grocery, saw the platform completely obscured by crows. They dispersed, though, as he turned into the drive.

The following morning, coffee in hand, Rory stopped to look out at the platform. At that moment, three crows landed and began to eat leftover mashed potatoes he’d offered. It took a moment before Rory realized the crows hadn’t scattered when they’d noticed him. The platform quickly filled with squawking wrangling birds.

Then they were gone.

Turning from the window, Rory was caught off guard by hope. Uncertain how, this whole endeavor had cracked the shell of his despair.

He’d immediately restocked the platform and, by the time he got back inside, the crows had returned. Rory watched as they ate, determined to learn all he could about the birds.

Initially, they were all the same: black birds with black eyes swarming for food. As they grew more comfortable with his presence and he theirs, Rory began noticing subtle differences. Some were bullies. Some were facilitators.

The standouts had names. Limper, a crow that had an old leg injury. Halfpint, a crow with one wing shorter than the other. One Eye, for obvious reasons.

By midsummer, the crows didn’t bother waiting for him to finish putting food on the platform before they started eating. His heart’s remaining bastion of despair was destroyed the day a crow landed on his shoulder.

Turning his head slowly, Rory had looked into the untamed black eyes of a crow. Instinct demanded he jerk and throw it off, but with effort, he held still. The bird cocked its head and Rory noticed the crow had a bit of twine held in its beak. The crow dropped the twine on his shoulder and flapped to the platform. Rory pulled the twine off his shoulder, examined it, amused, and let it fall to the ground.

The crow stopped eating, squawked loudly, snatched the twine from the ground and flapped back to the platform. The bird dropped the twine in front of Rory and looked at him. Unsure of what to do, Rory picked up the twine and closed his hand around it. The crow, apparently appeased, went back to eating.

Rory began to laugh, “Goddam it, Elaine, you’d have loved this.” The birds, spooked for a moment, returned quickly. Chuckling to himself, Rory placed the twine in his pocket and went inside.

A routine had evolved between Rory and the crows as summer wooed autumn. He’d wake (largely due to an annoying prostate), make his bed, and get dressed before dawn. While waiting for his coffee, he’d restock the platforms. He’d since added two additional platforms due to overcrowding. Once back inside, he’d get his cup, sit in his chair by the window and wait. Without fail, the crows would come.

The crows began leaving gifts for him regularly. Sometimes, not much more than twigs and grass, but occasionally they’d drop a true treasure. They had brought him a key, several pieces of plastic, including half a plastic egg. Strangest of all, they’d left a weather-scarred photo of a young woman who appeared to be riding a white buffalo and shooting an arrow.

Initially, he’d thrown the stuff away only to find, for reasons he couldn’t ascertain, he’d pull the items from the trash, leaving it on the counter. Realizing that was not a long-term solution, Rory decided add them to Elaine’s small ornate chest in which she’d kept her most precious keepsakes collected over the years.

The relationship matured and Rory soon had a lawn chair positioned amongst the platforms. The birds landed freely around him and, occasionally, a young one landed on him. By the reaction of the others, Rory got the impression this was improper crow etiquette. They’d caw loudly and flap around until the young one got the point and flew off.

Word had gotten around about his kinship with the crows. Neighbors, uncertain if Rory was a weirdo or a wonder, shared photos on social media of him surrounded by the birds. One nervous neighbor, sure that crows were “of the devil”, had called animal control. Animal control came, but loved what Rory had done. Ultimately catching the interest of the local news, the station came out and interviewed Rory while he sat in a sea of black birds. The news dubbed him The Crow Man.

The first frost was settling on the lawn when Rory was startled from sleep by the sound of breaking glass. Confused, he’d laid in bed listening. More glass shattered downstairs. Then muffled voices and shoes. He’d sat up in his bed, trying to think. Heart pounding in his ears, he couldn’t hear anything over his own breathing.

“Hello!” He’d yelled, “Hello! Who’s down there?”

The house went silent. Rory had reached for his cell, cursing when he recalled leaving it by the couch. He hardly ever used the thing.

Sound of movement on the stairs.

Rory climbed out of bed, unsure of his own intentions. The decision was made for him, however, when he tripped on his slippers. Flailing his arms for something to grab, he fell, landing hard on his side. Rory heard a squishy pop followed by liquid hell through his right hip.

Through the agony, he heard noise in the hall outside his room. Rory groped around for anything to help and knocked Elaine’s small chest end over end across the floor, the contents splaying.

With a crash, his bedroom door blew open. In the gloom, Rory could see three people rush the room. He didn’t have long to think about anything before the first one landed him a kick to the face.

His mind exploded with light and the thought burst into his head that he was grateful he’d left his dentures on the side of the bed or that kick would’ve broke them for sure. The second kick should have killed him.

Feeling as though each lid weighed a thousand pounds, Rory tried to open his eyes.

“There he is,” a cheerful voice said to his side, “Take your time. It’ll take a minute to get your head straight. You’re safe and you’re going to be okay.”

Rory’s vision cleared. Beside the bed stood a lovely young woman in scrubs looking down at him. Rory opened his mouth to speak but just croaked.

“Hold on. Let’s see if we can get you a sip or two of water. You’ve been out for a while.”

The woman moved away, returning in a moment carrying a white foam cup, assisting Rory to get a small drink. Relieved, Rory tried again, “What happened?” He began to explore his various bandages.

The nurse nodded, “I’m Dor, your nurse for the next few hours. You’re at Mercy Hospital and, well... mister, you’ve been through quite the ordeal. You got here two days ago after an attack in your home. I don’t know a lot more than that, but the police can fill you in. You arrived with multiple injuries, including a broken hip and a head injury that needed surgery. You have a few broken ribs, a broken nose, three broken fingers and lots of cuts and scratches,” she roamed the room completing various tasks while she spoke, “All this should heal fine, but it will take some time to get you back to your usual spry self.”

This caused Rory to laugh but only came out as a grunt. “Assaulted in my home?” Rory asked.

“Well, I’m going to let the police in here in a moment and they will handle all that, but I just wanted to introduce myself and make sure you have all you need.”

Rory, feeling disoriented, pointed toward the cup, “Mind handing me that water?” Dor brought him the water, ensuring Rory knew how to operate his pain and nurse call buttons. Satisfied Rory was taken care of, the nurse swooshed from the room.

The nurse had been gone only a few minutes before the door opened again, revealing a gentleman wearing a polo shirt, khakis, a badge, and gun. Approaching the bed, he offered a hand, “Good afternoon, sir. I’m detective Knolls with the Great Rapids Police Department. How are you feeling?”

“Nurse just told me I should be back to my ‘spry’ self in no time. I haven’t been spry in decades. I am looking forward to that.” Rory declined the offered hand, displaying bandaged fingers.

Withdrawing his hand apologetically, Knolls said, “I was hoping, if you’re feeling up to it, to get your statement about the unfortunate attack in your home?”

“Absolutely, but I don’t recall a whole lot.”

“That’s fine, sir. Just tell me what you do recall,” he replied, pulling a notebook and pen.

Rory told Knolls all he could remember about the attack and the events of that day. Knolls nodded, only interrupting occasionally to ask a question. The telling didn’t take long and soon the detective was filling Rory in on what he knew.

“We’re still investigating the situation, but here’s the time-line, as we know it. 911 received a call from your neighbor and the police were dispatched. The 911 report states the neighbor heard screaming from your home, grew concerned and came over. Noticing a broken window, she called the police,” Knolls flipped a page in his notebook, “Officers arrived, gaining entry via the broken window. Upon entry, officers noted the place appeared ransacked.” Knoll glanced at Rory, “The responding officers found you, unconscious, in your bedroom along with the three men we believe assaulted you. The three men were incapacitated, huddled against the wall having sustained life threatening injuries.”

“How?” Rory stuttered out, setting the shaking cup on the table.

“That’s what we’re trying to figure out. All three men are hospitalized. They’re a couple floors down, in critical care, under guard.”

“What happened to them?” Rory asked bewildered.

“We aren’t clear on that,” Knolls said but then looked closely at Rory, “All three appear to have been mutilated by — birds.”

Rory blinked.

“Yes, Knolls continued, “two men lost their eyes. The third was smart enough to cover his face at the expense of his hands. The birds appeared to be aiming for throat and eyes, nearly killing one of them. You will likely leave long before they do.”

“My god,” Rory whispered.

“Yes. I’ve never seen anything like this. Do own birds?” Knolls asked suddenly.

“No. No pets,” Rory said, still lost in shock.

“Okay,” Knoll replied, “the neighbor said you feed birds, so we thought maybe you had some inside the house.”

At the mention of feeding birds, Rory said, “Oh! Well, I feed crows. They come to my yard, and I feed them. They don’t live in the house, though.”

Knoll snapped his fingers, “Wait. Are you that bird guy? What’d they call you,” he grasped for a moment, “the Crow Man. You were on the news not too long ago, right?”

Rory grinned, putting hands up in surrender, “Guilty as charged, officer.”

Chuckling, Knolls said, “That was pretty cool. My daughter wants to try it.” Recalling his business, “No pets, but you feed crows. The odd things, sir, is that’s also what we found throughout your house. Crow feathers.” Knolls looked at Rory expectantly.

Rory felt lost and looked the part.

“We have a lot of bizarre evidence that seems to indicate the crows were involved somehow, but that seems rather unlikely. As it is, unless you recall anything further, we will have to wait to talk to the three suspects when they are able.”

“I’m sorry, no I don’t recall anything else. This is so bizarre,” Rory felt dizzy.

“I’ll swing by in the morning to see how you’re doing, sir. If you recall anything further, we can discuss it then and here’s my card,” Knoll placed a business card on the table.

“I appreciate the help, detective,” Rory said.

“You bet.” Knolls began to head to the door. Stopping, he snapped his fingers, “I almost forgot,” he said reaching into his pocket. He pulled out a small plastic bag, “Looks like the thieves were trying to pry this off you. We found it on the floor near where you were attacked.”

Taking the bag, Rory could only stare at it as Knolls turned and left the room.

Rory opened the bag, took out a small gold band and put it back on his finger, crying and laughing.",2,1730039041.0,NoSleepAuthors,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now. I’m definitely on the “ace spectrum” but I do have some fetishes. 

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

About you: Preferably you’d be into the stuff I am into, too! I find girl-next-door type women to be cute. Long hair, smooth legs, enjoys hugs, things like that. Girls who can rock a sundress or skirt with Chucks are tens out of ten! 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with.

For around a week now I've been playing a couple games on my PC that give you free rewards for playing for some time, but even when it says I can claim them nothing happens for like 40 seconds. I first got this bug in ""make calls to save your best friend tycoon"" and I thought it was something with the game so I ignored it. Then 2-3 days later I started playing ""Coffee Shop Tycoon"" on a different account and device and everything was fine which made me think I was right about the bug only being in that one game, but then I joined the game again on my PC and the bug started appearing again. Two days ago I finished the ""make calls tycoon"" game so I started playing another game made by the same group and it's happening again. Does anyone know how to fix it? It's getting annoying

1gdc31c,https://www.reddit.com/r/studyAbroad/comments/1gdc31c/experience_at_shed_coliving_krakow_a_warning_for/,Experience at SHED Co-living Krakow: A Warning for Future Students,">**Writing this feedback wasn’t exactly on my bucket list, but here we are. Honestly, I don’t want other students to go through the rollercoaster ride we did at SHED Dormitory Cracow. Who wants their European adventure spoiled by a bunch of unprofessional folks?**

>

From day one, they showed us exactly what they were about. When my roommate and I asked to see some nice rooms with a view, we were met with a response that could only be described as a cold slap: “We’re not your personal assistants.” It felt more like they were saying, “If you don’t like it, good luck finding somewhere else.” But hey, maybe they just had a rough morning. We decided to give them the chance.



Once we finally settled in, that’s when the real circus began. Here’s the full rundown of the chaos:



**1. Safety Issues:** Based on my deep dive into [**Google reviews**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vDrUPzSedJiw9c2XA)**,** I discovered that one of the reception guys seems to have taken on the role of a reality TV producer. Apparently, this guy was caught watching the gym girls on the cameras and then knocking on doors late at night. It was like he was trying to deliver some kind of questionable service. Professional training before the job? Nope, thanks. We were charged around a lovely 3K PLN every month, and on top of that, if your guest overstayed their welcome by three days, you got hit with an extra fee for “security.” Meanwhile, they had this guest list that felt more like a bad joke than a real security measure. It’s as if they thought, “Who needs real safety when we can just add more fees?” Despite this being a student dorm, they turned all the empty summer rooms into hotel rooms, transforming our home into a makeshift motel where anything could happen.



**2. Management:** If you’re looking for a textbook example of customer service, look elsewhere. The management here could give a masterclass in how to ignore complaints. You could repeat your issues ten times, and it felt like you were talking to a wall. I half expect to see them at the next “How Not to Manage a Dorm” seminar. Seriously, if someone in a higher position reads this, please reconsider the management you’ve assigned to handle 700 students. They need a serious refresher course on how to actually help people. Let me tell you about my wild ride trying to get my payment sorted out! When I first asked them to check, they hit me with, “We’re not your personal accountants, just throw us the check.” I mean, considering I have a contract with my name on it, checking my payment shouldn’t be rocket science, right? But hold on, it gets better! They later claimed they couldn’t see my payment at all. Instead of just asking my bank directly, they turned my life into a sitcom with all the drama and frustration. I’m practically ready to write a book titled “How to Make a Simple Payment Into a Major Life Crisis.” And here’s a kicker: I found out that some of the managers are busy trying to scrub all the bad reviews. Talk about dedication!



**3. Noise Levels:** Now, I know dorms can be loud—trust me, I’ve been there—but this place took it to a whole new level. I’ve never heard such a party atmosphere in a study space. Imagine trying to focus on your assignments while the common area turns into a nightclub, complete with music blasting until the wee hours. “Hey, can you guys turn it down a notch?” we kindly asked. Their reply? “If it bothers you, maybe just switch rooms.” So, instead of addressing the problem, their solution was to just shove us somewhere else. I guess keeping 15 people happy is too much of a hassle. When we asked security to handle the noise situation, it was like trying to get a cat to take a bath. Good luck with that.



**4. Fridge Situation:** Let’s talk about the fridge situation. For the lovely price of around 3000 PLN for our room, you’d think we’d get a decent mini-fridge, right? Nope. Instead, we were gifted with a mini-fridge. Our food had to take refuge in the huge common fridge, which felt more like a game of food hide-and-seek, despite all the cameras keeping an eye on us like Big Brother; unfortunately, they were more likely made by 5-minute crafts kinds of stuff like never useful but always there. Twice, our food mysteriously disappeared. When we asked them to check the cameras, they just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. If you enjoy the game of “Guess Where’s My Dinner Now?” this is the place for you.



**5. Room and Bed Sizes:** You know those rooms they advertise for two people? Well, they clearly have a different definition of cozy. The bed size was more appropriate for one person—definitely not meant for two people. And guess what? No air conditioning in a brand-new 2023 building. Who needs cool air when you can just sweat it out, right? We had to buy a fan that could probably power a small country just to survive the heat. At this rate, I might as well invest in a portable sauna.



**6. Walls:** The walls here are practically made of tissue paper. You can hear everything. I once overheard my neighbor discussing their life choices and questionable music choices. And don’t even get me started on the sounds coming from their night dance. It was like living next to a live performance of a very questionable nature. Privacy? What’s that?



Now, picture this scenario: it’s 3 AM, and you’re trying to work in a glass-walled room that’s supposed to be a sanctuary of peace. Suddenly, two middle-aged guys are banging on the glass like they’re auditioning for the next big action flick. As the reception escorted them away, they staggered down the hall, looking like they were in an eating contest gone wrong. Honestly, it was one of the most surreal sights—these dudes were clearly under the influence of some wild kind of drugs, probably bad decisions, and way too much junk food. The receptionist said they were “hotel guests,” which felt like a punchline to a really bad joke about 700 students secure. I wish I had Will Smith with a neuralyzer at that time; maybe it would have helped me erase that moment from my entire memory. Meanwhile, let’s talk about the security measures in place. Your friend had to wait at the door like we were auditioning for a secret society. Just put the fires on the bag, man. Named this security but let an unknown bazillion middle-aged sweet van man-type people live at the same time with students. Not cool.



Then, there was one tenant who had quite the experience in his room. Imagine this: You're in the room with confidence because you're sure you locked your door. What could happen, right? But then the cleaning lady, key card in hand, walked into your small room and saw you naked. It’s a wonder she didn’t hand him a towel and invite him in for a waltz. Don't ask why he is naked in his room.



**7. Unprofessional Behavior**: With the exception of a couple of lovely staff members at reception, the rest acted like they were auditioning for a soap opera with their eye rolls and dramatic sighs whenever you asked for help. It felt like they were sharing your personal info over coffee breaks just for kicks. If you need a lesson in how to not take your job seriously, this is the place to learn it. When I tried to get some basic information, it was like asking a cat for directions. So many blank stares and ignoring sounds. It was almost impressive.



**8. Elevators:** For over half of our stay, at least three out of the four elevators were out of service. I can’t even count how many times I ended up on the stairs, lugging my bags up and down like I was Sisyphus. If you want a workout while trying to get to your room, this place supports a healthy life. Just don’t forget your water bottle. It became a daily routine, waiting for an elevator that rarely arrived, and when it did, it was like winning the lottery.



**And here’s the cherry on top**: after our contract ended, they tried to sneak in a clause that basically said, “If you don’t want to end up in the Bad Review Hall of Fame, keep your mouth shut.” What a creative way to avoid accountability. They even threatened me with an email after I shared my honest feedback online. It’s like they think we’re too scared to speak up in 2024.



It’s such a shame to deal with this kind of unprofessionalism, especially in a country that values freedom of speech. If only management could turn complaints into actual improvements, they’d be the talk of the town—minus the eye rolls.



**I really hope no student has to go through this while trying to enjoy one of the most exciting times of their lives. Do your homework before picking a place to stay, and for the love of all things good, steer clear of places like Shed Co-Living. Your future self will thank you :)**",0,1730039015.0,studyAbroad,0,0.5,False

1gdc0o0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Invisalign/comments/1gdc0o0/psa_my_honest_experience_with_invisalign_and_now/,PSA: my honest experience with Invisalign and now braces…,"I must have scoured the Internet to help me make this decision. I am compiling the pros &cons based on my experience as an adult woman - it WILL NOT apply to everyone:)

First things First: please pick an orthodontist. Dentists do not have the training to troubleshoot when things do not track. 

Why I had to switch: two of my teeth (most crucial) were not tracking despite compliant wear over 8 months….

Appearance: Point to Invisalign! But please remember that there are attachments. Also, aligners can get discolored. Changing an aligner in public is not the most appealing thing to look at! 

Food choices: Another point to Invisalign. There is no restriction on crunchy foods, etc. 
I found timing three meals, coffee, snacks, brushing, and flossing after each food consumption very tedious….
If you are grazer, please think about this. 

Pain: Both hurt! Braces hurt every four weeks or so when they make adjustments. Also, you need wax, etc., for the discomfort in the inner mouth. Invisalign hurts with every tray change (7-14 days). Some trays hurt every time I put them back in after eating.

Hygiene: Both require more attention to dental hygiene. Invisalign can be TOO much. Brushing and flossing 3-4 times a day—in between work—can be too much, especially when life gets hard…If you let it slip, you will have a much higher risk of cavities! 
With braces, I invested in a water pik and Costco had a portable one, which I use at work. 

Pricing/Frequency of Appointments: braces rely on the orthodontist to make adjustments, so you have to go in more frequently. Invisalign has less frequent appointments. 
For this reason, the price at my orthodontist practice was very similar. You pay for the orthodontist's time over the raw material. 

What is your personality? I found that with Invisalign, my teeth dictated my life. There were weeks when work and life got crazy, and it was the last thing I wanted to worry about!
With braces, I know it is working in the background. Even if I don’t have time for a detailed floss - I can rinse my mouth with a water pik for 30 seconds and get on with my day. I also wouldn’t recommend Invisalign to my children. They just don’t have the frontal cortex development to keep up with it!

If I had to do it all over again: I would value my TIME over my VANITY and choose metal braces…and save 8 months!

EDIT: I am not anti-Invisalign. If my teeth had tracked, I would have stuck it out. We always celebrate the successful ones. I just think it is important to discuss the less successful cases.

Hello espresso enthusiasts,
I recently bought Hibrew h10a with hibrew G5 grinder, I'm having trouble dialing in the espresso I'll elaborate below.
1. First attempt was made with beans that we're light roast and quite old so all I got was extremely sour shots that ran in 15 secs, I figured that my beans are stale (roasted 4 months ago) so I gave up on them.
2. Second attempt was with the beans that were roasted around first week of September and similar thing happened (btw it says filter roast on the pack) and enough pressure was not generated,  it showed that the pressure was around 8-9 bars on the machine.
Further just for the sake of experiment I tried grinding finer ( I was grinding the finest espresso setting up until that point on the g5 grinder, this time I went into Turkish coffee range) 
RESULT: more pressure was generated this time, the shot ran 5 sec slower ( 20 sec now) and obviously espresso was bad.
 
Now comes the question 
1. Is this a stale beans problem?
2. Or grind size issue?
3. If it's a grind size issue, is anyone familiar with the Hibrew G5 grinder and can I calibrate it to grind finer? Because I was pretty much at end range for the 20 sec shot which generated high pressure.

Any kind of help or insight is helpful, please do share your thoughts.

1gdbyu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1gdbyu5/apparently_protected_woodland_doesnt_matter_if/,Apparently protected woodland doesn't matter if you have kids,"So I live in a rural area with protected ancient woodland.

The forest is big and beautiful near me, and so nice for long walks, especially in spring and autumn.

Today my partner and I got up late, went to a cute cafe for a coffee and pastries, and then went to the local woodland for a long leisurely stroll to enjoy the autumn colours. (Hurray for leisurely childfree weekends)

Most people in the forest were all well behaved, walking their dogs either on leashes, or with dogs that were well behaved with good recall. Couples walking arm in arm. Blissful.

The one family we saw, was a man and woman with three kids. We heard the screaming from ages away, and decided to pick up the pace so we could pass them by quickly. The three kids were under a very old but skinny tree, and the man was aggressively shaking the trunk and various branches to get leaves to fall quickly on the kids, so that the mum could snap photos for social media.

I went up to them and asked if they could not shake the tree, as the whole woodland is a protected conservation area (and signs literally all around us clearly state not to damage or disturb the trees). I suggested that they could just pick up some of the leaves from the forest floor (literally thousands of freshly fallen leaves) and throw them in the air to create the same effect for their video. Or better yet, just take a video of the leaves falling all around us at a fast and natural pace.

The dad immediately has an attitude, tells me to fuck off, threatens to fight me (in front of his kids, very classy). The mum also starts swearing and being a total Karen, saying ""it's just a fucking tree"".

I take their picture and tell them I'm passing it on to the local ranger so that they're aware of their behaviour, and walk off.

I'm honestly just so done with how entitled parents can be. Do they not understand that nature isn't their personal playground? They've probably caused damage to the poor tree they were harassing. Also, it's completely selfish to try and shake all the leaves off a tree just for their photo, why can't they leave it alone so other people can enjoy the scenery too?",54,1730038706.0,childfree,2,0.99,False

1gdbv4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Erasmus/comments/1gdbv4d/experience_at_shed_krakow_a_warning_for_future/,Experience at SHED Krakow: A Warning for Future Students,">**Writing this feedback wasn’t exactly on my bucket list, but here we are. Honestly, I don’t want other students to go through the rollercoaster ride we did at SHED Dormitory Cracow. Who wants their European adventure spoiled by a bunch of unprofessional folks?**

From day one, they showed us exactly what they were about. When my roommate and I asked to see some nice rooms with a view, we were met with a response that could only be described as a cold slap: “We’re not your personal assistants.” It felt more like they were saying, “If you don’t like it, good luck finding somewhere else.” But hey, maybe they just had a rough morning. We decided to give them the chance.

Once we finally settled in, that’s when the real circus began. Here’s the full rundown of the chaos:

  
**1. Safety Issues:** Based on my deep dive into [Google reviews,](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vDrUPzSedJiw9c2XA) I discovered that one of the reception guys seems to have taken on the role of a reality TV producer. Apparently, this guy was caught watching the gym girls on the cameras and then knocking on doors late at night. It was like he was trying to deliver some kind of questionable service. Professional training before the job? Nope, thanks. We were charged around a lovely 3K PLN every month, and on top of that, if your guest overstayed their welcome by three days, you got hit with an extra fee for “security.” Meanwhile, they had this guest list that felt more like a bad joke than a real security measure. It’s as if they thought, “Who needs real safety when we can just add more fees?” Despite this being a student dorm, they turned all the empty summer rooms into hotel rooms, transforming our home into a makeshift motel where anything could happen.

**2. Management:** If you’re looking for a textbook example of customer service, look elsewhere. The management here could give a masterclass in how to ignore complaints. You could repeat your issues ten times, and it felt like you were talking to a wall. I half expect to see them at the next “How Not to Manage a Dorm” seminar. Seriously, if someone in a higher position reads this, please reconsider the management you’ve assigned to handle 700 students. They need a serious refresher course on how to actually help people. Let me tell you about my wild ride trying to get my payment sorted out! When I first asked them to check, they hit me with, “We’re not your personal accountants, just throw us the check.” I mean, considering I have a contract with my name on it, checking my payment shouldn’t be rocket science, right? But hold on, it gets better! They later claimed they couldn’t see my payment at all. Instead of just asking my bank directly, they turned my life into a sitcom with all the drama and frustration. I’m practically ready to write a book titled “How to Make a Simple Payment Into a Major Life Crisis.” And here’s a kicker: I found out that some of the managers are busy trying to scrub all the bad reviews. Talk about dedication!

**3. Noise Levels:** Now, I know dorms can be loud—trust me, I’ve been there—but this place took it to a whole new level. I’ve never heard such a party atmosphere in a study space. Imagine trying to focus on your assignments while the common area turns into a nightclub, complete with music blasting until the wee hours. “Hey, can you guys turn it down a notch?” we kindly asked. Their reply? “If it bothers you, maybe just switch rooms.” So, instead of addressing the problem, their solution was to just shove us somewhere else. I guess keeping 15 people happy is too much of a hassle. When we asked security to handle the noise situation, it was like trying to get a cat to take a bath. Good luck with that.

**4. Fridge Situation**: Let’s talk about the fridge situation. For the lovely price of around 3000 PLN for our room, you’d think we’d get a decent mini-fridge, right? Nope. Instead, we were gifted with a mini-fridge. Our food had to take refuge in the huge common fridge, which felt more like a game of food hide-and-seek, despite all the cameras keeping an eye on us like Big Brother; unfortunately, they were more likely made by 5-minute crafts kinds of stuff like never useful but always there. Twice, our food mysteriously disappeared. When we asked them to check the cameras, they just shrugged it off like it was no big deal. If you enjoy the game of “Guess Where’s My Dinner Now?” this is the place for you.

**5. Room and Bed Sizes:** You know those rooms they advertise for two people? Well, they clearly have a different definition of cozy. The bed size was more appropriate for one person—definitely not meant for two people. And guess what? No air conditioning in a brand-new 2023 building. Who needs cool air when you can just sweat it out, right? We had to buy a fan that could probably power a small country just to survive the heat. At this rate, I might as well invest in a portable sauna.

**6. Walls:** The walls here are practically made of tissue paper. You can hear everything. I once overheard my neighbor discussing their life choices and questionable music choices. And don’t even get me started on the sounds coming from their night dance. It was like living next to a live performance of a very questionable nature. Privacy? What’s that?

Now, picture this scenario: it’s 3 AM, and you’re trying to work in a glass-walled room that’s supposed to be a sanctuary of peace. Suddenly, two middle-aged guys are banging on the glass like they’re auditioning for the next big action flick. As the reception escorted them away, they staggered down the hall, looking like they were in an eating contest gone wrong. Honestly, it was one of the most surreal sights—these dudes were clearly under the influence of some wild kind of drugs, probably bad decisions, and way too much junk food. The receptionist said they were “hotel guests,” which felt like a punchline to a really bad joke about 700 students secure. I wish I had Will Smith with a neuralyzer at that time; maybe it would have helped me erase that moment from my entire memory. Meanwhile, let’s talk about the security measures in place. Your friend had to wait at the door like we were auditioning for a secret society. Just put the fires on the bag, man. Named this security but let an unknown bazillion middle-aged sweet van man-type people live at the same time with students. Not cool.

Then, there was one tenant who had quite the experience in his room. Imagine this: You're in the room with confidence because you're sure you locked your door. What could happen, right? But then the cleaning lady, key card in hand, walked into your small room and saw you naked. It’s a wonder she didn’t hand him a towel and invite him in for a waltz. Don't ask why he is naked in his room.

**7. Unprofessional Behavior:** With the exception of a couple of lovely staff members at reception, the rest acted like they were auditioning for a soap opera with their eye rolls and dramatic sighs whenever you asked for help. It felt like they were sharing your personal info over coffee breaks just for kicks. If you need a lesson in how to not take your job seriously, this is the place to learn it. When I tried to get some basic information, it was like asking a cat for directions. So many blank stares and ignoring sounds. It was almost impressive.

**8. Elevators:** For over half of our stay, at least three out of the four elevators were out of service. I can’t even count how many times I ended up on the stairs, lugging my bags up and down like I was Sisyphus. If you want a workout while trying to get to your room, this place supports a healthy life. Just don’t forget your water bottle. It became a daily routine, waiting for an elevator that rarely arrived, and when it did, it was like winning the lottery.

**And here’s the cherry on top:** after our contract ended, they tried to sneak in a clause that basically said, “If you don’t want to end up in the Bad Review Hall of Fame, keep your mouth shut.” What a creative way to avoid accountability. They even threatened me with an email after I shared my honest feedback online. It’s like they think we’re too scared to speak up in 2024.

It’s such a shame to deal with this kind of unprofessionalism, especially in a country that values freedom of speech. If only management could turn complaints into actual improvements, they’d be the talk of the town—minus the eye rolls.

**I really hope no student has to go through this while trying to enjoy one of the most exciting times of their lives. Do your homework before picking a place to stay, and for the love of all things good, steer clear of places like Shed Co-Living. Your future self will thank you :)**",0,1730038416.0,Erasmus,1,0.38,False
1gdbv2e,https://www.reddit.com/r/progrockmusic/comments/1gdbv2e/two_sides_of_peter_banks_is_phenomenally/,Two Sides of Peter Banks is phenomenally underrated,"Two Sides honestly builds one of the best atmospheres I've ever heard on an album. The whole thing just puts me at ease like a late night cup of coffee.

 Side one starts with some incredible acoustic work, complimented by occasional electric flourishes that put you at such ease. Then Knights just rip through the tapestry that the previous track created, only to resew it into a different, moodier piece. After that, Battles once again cuts through with some of the first drum work on the album, making a fun jam that honestly reminds me of the upbeat improv section of Echoes. After that trip there's a short reprisal of Knights, before culminating with an epilogue of sorts in Last Eclipse. 

Side two is a little less stunning but still very nice. The acoustic work that Jan Akkerman does on Loneliest Sea is phenomenal. Oh, right, this whole album has an A list of prog musicians. Jan Akkerman of Focus, Phil Collins and Steve Hackett of Genesis, John Wetton (or Whetton as the sleeve says) of King Crimson, and some of Banks' bandmates from Flash. Anyway, side two has a fun jam session amongst Jan, Pete, and Phil called Stop That! where they trade some nice solos. The albums ends on a quirky note with Get Out of My Fridge, which feels like it could be a sitcom outro from the 90s. 

All in all, probably my personal favorite Yes solo album. It's a real shame Banks never made anything like it, because it really is a gem.
