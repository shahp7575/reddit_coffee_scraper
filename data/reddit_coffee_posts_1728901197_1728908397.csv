# Discovering Neuro-Thrive

In a sea of supplements and brain-boosting solutions, Neuro-Thrive stood out like a beacon of hope. Its promise of supporting memory, focus, and overall brain health in just one veggie capsule a day seemed almost too good to be true. But as I delved deeper into the science behind Neuro-Thrive, I discovered a wealth of research backing its efficacy.

But as I approached the end of the first week, subtle changes began to emerge. I found myself recalling names and details with greater ease, and my mental clarity seemed sharper than usual. Could it be the Neuro-Thrive effect kicking in, or was it just a placebo? I couldn't deny the improvements I was experiencing, but I remained cautiously optimistic, knowing that true results take time.

# Reflecting on Neuro-Thrive's Impact

As I continued to take Neuro-Thrive daily, the improvements became more pronounced. My ability to stay focused and attentive throughout the day was noticeably enhanced, and I felt more alert and engaged in my daily tasks. Even my mood seemed uplifted, a welcome bonus I hadn't anticipated. With each passing day, I found myself becoming a believer in the power of Neuro-Thrive. Gone were my doubts about its efficacy; instead, I marveled at the transformation taking place within my own brain. It was clear to me now: Neuro-Thrive wasn't just another supplement; it was a game-changer for brain health.

Boston area - 63M 5'9"" 170 lbs - Vaccinated 7x - Recent STD tests: all negative

I don't drink, smoke, or do drugs. I'm **not** a recovering drinker, smoker, nor drug user, I just never cared for them, nor to be around people who are drunk or high. I'm open to a considerate smoker, and someone who may enjoy a drink but doesn't **need** it to be social or intimate.

I'm quite happy with my life as it is. I'm open to meeting someone new if it works.

I started choosing to have ethically open relationships about 25 years ago. Being inclined to see more than one person at the same time is just part of who I am. Integrity is a core value for me, so I try to be as clear about this as I can early on. I'm open to as much disclosure as each partner and I are comfortable negotiating.

I take a ""non-hierarchical"" approach. I don't treat any partner as ""primary,"" ""secondary,"" etc., which is probably a by-product of my not being married and living alone. If you have a different approach, that's fine.

We'll also probably have to discuss the terminology, since I've found that ""polyamory,"" ENM (ethical non-monogamy), and CNM (consensual non-monogamy) often mean somewhat different things to different people.

I offer:

* strength and experience
* empathy and respect
* compersion, e.g., I'm also happy when your other partners treat you well
* good sense of humor
* patience and acceptance
* fairness and compassion
* growth
* a safe, healing space
* slow sensuality, warm aftercare
* the ability to make grammatically coordinated lists

I am:

* quietly enthusiastic, excited about life
* playful
* always learning, always curious, especially about you
* good listener, most of the time
* supportive
* comfortable with silence, just being present, especially with you
* imperfect

I can:

* teach you about me, learn about you
* take responsibility for my mistakes and flaws, sometimes even learn from them
* be spontaneous, in a planned and careful way
* share my feelings, quietly listen to yours
* be kinky when it works for both of us, details to be discussed, never required

I have:

* room in my life for another if we're a good match
* good self-esteem
* healthy boundaries, respect for your boundaries
* the ability to really see you, if you feel safe enough to show me
* open relationships, honestly disclosed to whatever level of detail we're both comfortable with

I will treat you well. I embrace **both** careful consent and well-timed risk-taking. I'm told that I've got sparkling brown eyes and a warm, accepting smile.

I'm a **gentleman** with old-school manners, until you ask me not to be.

I'm looking for a **woman** who:

* loves to share food in a restaurant or on our own
* insists on being treated well, stands up for herself
* wants to explore her sensual submissive side, or explore it further
* enjoys flavors beyond vanilla

Someone who is:

* kind
* smart and capable by day, sometimes wants someone else to take the lead when she doesn't have to be in charge
* articulate
* affectionate, loves to touch and be touched
* curious, wants to learn more
* open-minded

Someone who can:

* ask questions
* teach me about you, what you like and need
* learn about me
* laugh about dualities and contradictions, debate how to unpack and accept them, possibly even change them

The following are not important to me, I have no expectations or requirements about your level of interest:

* travel
* sports
* long-distance relationships
* penpals

Note that I don't require that you are 100% compatible with **every** item listed above. I hope that, like me, you aspire to do your best most of the time.

I'm in no hurry.

Let's talk. After some messaging, if we both feel comfortable we can then meet in person over coffee or ice cream, with no pressure, no agenda except to talk more and see how it feels being together.

I finally let these 2 coffee rest enough to start brewing, and I'm absolutely blown away!

To start off, I don't think I have hade any coffees before this that have seen as much processing, and I haven't had any coffees from this quality level before, so I don't have any good reference points /disclaimer

I always make a french press first when trying new beans, so a bit over 3 weeks off roast I tried both of them this way.
So much fruit and sweetness, a very juicy mouthfeel, the aroma of both is really something.

At the moment I'm focusing on the Jose Giraldo first.
The brewed coffee gives me an aroma of what I expect pineapple candy would taste like.
In the taste I get some pineapple, peach, maybe some cotton candy?
Very juicy and sweet, but not obnoxiously so.

First v60 was Hoffmann's 1 cup technique, K6 on 85 clicks, 96C water. I usually use a brita filter but got bottled water for this one.

First cup is already in the ballpark, same aroma, quite some fruitiness. Drawdown was a bit quick so I poured from a little higher to add some agitation in the subsequent pours. I'll probably try one or two clicks finer. No harshness in the taste, so I'm guessing the temperature is good(it's a very light roast).

I can't read the situation ,"So I met a girl a few weeks back, she seems great and I know it's still very early days, but she's not like anyone I've dated before and as far as I'm concerned she ticks all my boxes.

We had a coffee date and went for a walk, ended up going to a bar for a few drinks (maybe like 3 drinks, nothing too heavy). We ended up back at my place but just kissed a lot, no sex. It was really hot though.

She talked a lot about wanting sex over text, so I reciprocated which was fine.

She later changed her tune and said she didn't want to just meet up for sex - she wanted to have cute dates and start something serious. I said I felt the same, and although I was very attracted to her and definitely did want to have sex with her, I was happy to wait until she felt comfortable and continue having dates until that day came. She seemed to not really believe me and she said I had fuck girl energy (this is 100% not who I am at all) but she said that it was good we were on the same page. 

We arranged another date for last friday, but she cancelled the day before, saying that being around people is giving her anxiety and she wouldn't be giving her best self at the minute.

I replied saying no problem. But it kind of is - I'm not happy about the situation but I'm accepting her choice. I just don't know if it's worth saying anything else to her as I really do like her.

Does it seem like she is just making excuses because she doesn't want to see me??

I'm aware that, statistically, this post will probably bother at least one person, but please go easy, I don't do a lot of dating around and I'm pretty monogamous/tend to focus on one person at a time with a decent amount of time in between.

Hii everyone, I’m a 20 yo guy from Serbia. Considering I’m closeted I don’t exactly wanna reveal my face on this sub but we can do that in private chat.         

Also, tell me something about yourself in your first message if you decide to send me a message, instead of just saying “hey”, otherwise I won’t reply.


My body pics are on my profile if that matters, I take care of myself in that sense.   


Also, if we grow closer and form a serious relationship, I will delete the pics from my profile if it bothers you. I know it’s ironic lol, but the pics are there for you to at least see my body if not my face.     


I’m 182 cm tall and around 70kg if height and weight matter to you.     


I’m looking for a masculine, caring, loving and loyal boyfriend who is interested in a ldr and ltr.   I’d prefer someone who is from Europe as the time zones will be much easier to handle.     


I’m looking for someone close to my age range but as long as you are 18+ it’s fine.        


I’m a bottom exclusively if that matters and looking for a top, although romance and intimacy is way more important than sex.     


I rly like gaming, I like going out although I don’t really go to bars and clubs as it’s not my thing, I really like going out for coffee, breakfast, lunch, dinner, with friends or dates and just chilling sometimes when I need to rest.

     
I mostly play: Throne of Liberty, Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves and BDO these days.     


I’m gay and I’m very secure in my sexuality and don’t need to explore any other options.     


Due to a small repertoire of potential boyfriends in my country and the nature of being closeted, I’ve started doing long distance relationships and have had quite a couple of successful ones.     


If you’re looking for something similar or the same thing as me, feel free to send a message and we can get to know each other :3.      


Also I’m not interested in straight curious guys so please don’t waste your time.

Things started off really well. He’s M31 (almost 32), I’m F25. We hit it off over messages, and he suggested we meet up in person.

**Date 1**: For our first date, we met in his city (I live 30 minutes away by train and was staying with my brother there anyway). It started off pretty casual. We grabbed coffee, and from the beginning, it felt comfortable—he seemed genuinely excited to meet me, sharing his cake and asking thoughtful questions about what I do and where I'm from. The conversation flowed easily.

He suggested we take a walk and play some arcade games, which was fun. He hesitated a bit before suggesting we ride a scooter together (maybe afraid I’d reject being close), but I agreed. Since I didn’t know how to drive it, he stood behind me and drove, and it was really sweet. He showed me around the city, including the highest floor of a hotel to see a beautiful view, and then some of the best streets.

At one point, he mentioned that I seemed hard to read and couldn’t tell if I was having a good time. I reassured him that I was, but it just takes me a while to open up. He rode a scooter with me to the bus station, hugged me goodbye, and said we should do this again. When I got home, I texted him to thank him for the date, and he asked for my number and suggested we meet the following week. He texted me sometimes during the week and was sweet overall.

**Date 2**: This time, he came to my small city, taking the train to see me. He was more touchy this time, but in a good way. We got coffee again and sat by the riverside, feeding the birds. Afterward, we went bowling, and he was extra supportive, putting his arm around my waist. I’m shy, especially when I like someone, so I didn’t know how to react, but I was okay with it.

He then mentioned going to a nightclub (with a nervous look like he was testing the waters). I hesitated and told him I would’ve liked to know beforehand. I explained that I’d never been to a nightclub, only pubs, and he said I should try it with some friends to see if I’d like it.

We went out for dinner, where he touched my hands, commented on how soft they were, and asked if I ever smoked. He said Im so innocent when I said I’d never tried it. He complimented me, saying I looked good in red, and insisted on paying for dinner. Afterward, we walked around my university, and that’s when he kissed me for the first time. It was sweet and didn’t feel rushed.

As we waited for his train, he held my hand, interlocked fingers, kissed me again, and even played with my hair. He complimented how good I smelled and mentioned some future places we could visit. He also showed me how to dance a little salsa while we waited. It was cute. We kissed and hugged goodbye, and I had to run to catch my bus. He texted me when he got home to make sure I’d caught my bus, which I appreciated. The next day I noticed he added a new picture to his Bumble profile, but I didn’t think much of it.

After that, though, his texts started to slow down. He’d reply late, and at one point, he said his sleep was bad and he had a doctor’s appointment. He still mentioned wanting to meet again but wasn’t as direct. He asked if I had plans for the weekend, and when I said I didn’t, he said he didn’t either. I ended up telling him I’d be in his city that weekend, and he agreed to meet. The day before, he told me he might be sick. I offered to cancel, but he said he could still meet if he felt better, which he did.

**Date 3**: When he saw me, his face lit up, and he said, “It’s so good to see you.” We grabbed coffee, and during this time, he brought up two future date ideas. He mentioned a bowling place near his home and joked about getting me a custom bowling ball as a gift because I struggle to find one that fits my hand. He also asked if I liked chocolate and suggested visiting a chocolate place he’d been to.

We spent the day walking around a park with animals. Despite saying he might be sick, he seemed fine. He took a phone call, explained who it was, and apologized. He stayed engaged throughout the date and even mentioned that if he’d known I was free in the evening, he would’ve planned something for us.

As the date went on, he continued to hold my hand and be physically affectionate. When we reached the station, he suggested we take a picture together in a photo booth, saying, “It’s about time for a picture.” I sat on his lap, and we kissed in the booth (though I realized he was trying to French kiss, but I was too nervous to let it happen). It was funny and awkward, but in a good way. Afterward, he hugged me tightly, kissed me again, and mentioned trying a restaurant next time. Then he said goodbye, and I took the train home.

**The Switch**: Six days went by without a word from him. Eventually, I texted to ask what was going on. That’s when he sent me a message saying, “Hey! I'm ok, just a bit stressed at work, I think. I think you’re wonderful, but somehow it doesn’t feel completely right for me :( Maybe our age difference is part of it, not sure. So not sure if we should continue.”

I told him I would’ve appreciated it if he’d been more upfront instead of leaving me wondering. He apologized, saying, “I’m sorry. I guess I just needed some time to think.” I asked why he’d suggested meeting again if he’d felt this way, and added, “I don’t know what went wrong… but it doesn’t matter now. It was fun, wish you the best.” He replied, “I had a good time. I wish you the best also.”

That was the last we talked. I unmatched him on Bumble and deleted his contact. But looking back, I’m confused. He was talking about future plans, took a photobooth picture together which felt nice... I don’t know what happened, and sometimes I wish I’d been more myself—less stressed and more open to his advances.

**So, Reddit, here’s my question: What went wrong? He seemed so into me during the dates, and now I’m left confused. I really liked him and wish I could fix things.**",1,1728907302.0,Bumble,1,1.0,False

1g3dz0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g3dz0j/will_she_come_back/,Will she come back?,"So here's the situation,

I (35m) working met somebody (25f) studying fashion in October last year. Everything I could ever want in a woman. We got together pretty fast, we got physical really fast, just two in love inseperable people. 

Ater a few months I sometimes felt like I was giving more than her. she never really wanted me to invest in her. I don't mean going on fancy dates or buying her things, I mean emotionally. While also she was very very reciprocal for love and affection. She had her way of showing it but it was just always less. I even threw out an I love you, but never got it back. Already some red flags. Mind you I was never really all over her constantly, I gave her enough freedom and space.

She's an expat studying here, so during the summer she went back to Spain to visit her family for three whole months, she never asked me to come with her, but she did send me updates of her life there. So I feel she kept me secret to her family this whole time. Cause when she got back she came with her dad who stayed there for another week,  and I could only see her after her dad left. So again hiding me. I didn't think much of it and let it slide cause I would just be too nosy.

We didn't hang out that much in September and this month now, cause she is is busy with her master year, which is asking a lot from her.

Two weeks ago we went on a date, things felt off. And it made me frustrated that we weren't as close as before, I jokingly said I would need a new girlfriend after some stupid thing we were joking about. She laughed and said it would be ok we would be going for coffee. So the day after I texted that I felt she was waiting for me to break up with her cause I felt nothing more than a friend. I felt unloved. And she didn't have the balls to do it herself. The thing she said bugged me hard and rubbed me the wrong way. I said if you wanna make this work then I need more time from you, I was hardly seeing her. Like if you care you would find more time right?

She said she cares for me a lot but she needs time and space, that we go in circles cause I ask more, she can't give more, we talk, I ask more. It's taking half of her mind, and she can't do that cause she needs to focus on her priorities which are her studies. She doesn't want me to wait for her and feels we are living two different realities. She thinks I think she's the woman I want for the rest of my life, and said she's not. 

She doesn't want me to change but she said she needs a bit of distance cause our lifestyles are not compatible right now. 

So all this time I felt like she just used me to fill that lonely void of being alone in a city, not wanting anything serious but never really fucking telling me straight to my face, always just stringing me along. Just somebody to keep her warm at night and give her validation. Feels good right? So never really giving the guy back what he deserved.

The keywords here are give her time and space, incompatible lifestyles **right now**. She never mentioned the words breaking up. She would love to go for coffee in a few months but thinks it's a bad idea right now.

So.. I don't want to wait but I also don't want to move further. I was happy with her, and I know if she ends her studies she could give this a lot more energy. She never really fought for this, just let it happen, giving in to the situation which can't be changed.

She knows I would be an amazing partner, I gave her my best while putting myself first a lot.

Will she come back or am I a fool that got used?

Mind you I'm focusing on myself, talking to different people (women)",1,1728907147.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

It’s like if a desktop went on a diet and got *ripped* instead of just losing weight. Here’s my take:

**Performance:**  
The 12th Gen Alder Lake N97 processor is no joke—it hits up to 3.6GHz, and paired with 16GB of RAM, it runs smoother than I do after a coffee. I’ve been able to run multiple programs at the same time, stream 4K content, and still not hear the fan screaming for mercy. It's like the calm, cool guy at the party who just knows what he’s doing.

**Storage:**  
It’s got a 512GB SSD, which means this thing boots up faster than I can find the remote when Netflix starts playing the next episode. Transferring files is quick, and there’s plenty of space for my media downloads. And if that’s not enough for you, you can slap in more storage easily—there’s room for both an extra SSD and a 2.5"" HDD. 

**Display & Graphics:**  
This little dude can handle triple 4K screens at once, which is wild. I’m running two 49” ultra-wide monitors (I know, I know, overkill), and it’s been as smooth as butter on a hot pancake. No lag, no weird flickers, just crisp visuals. Perfect for watching movies, editing stuff, or pretending to be productive when I’ve got five tabs of YouTube open.

**Connectivity:**  
It’s got USB 3.0, Ethernet, HDMI, and even VGA (because apparently, some of us still live in 2005). The WiFi 5 and Bluetooth 4.2 are fine, though, if I’m nitpicking, it’d be cooler if it had WiFi 6, but let’s be honest, I can’t tell the difference when I’m streaming cat videos on YouTube. The Bluetooth works well enough for my mouse and keyboard, so I can’t really complain.

For something so small, the KAMRUI GK3Plus packs a punch. It’s perfect if you need a reliable, compact PC for light work, streaming, or even multitasking across multiple displays. Plus, it doesn’t break the bank. If you’re looking for a mini PC that can handle a bit of everything, this is the one.

[Aluminum does not occur naturally in a pure form due to its reactivity. Instead, it is extracted from bauxite ore, refined into alumina, and then smelted through electrolysis. - \(Wikimedia Commons\)](https://preview.redd.it/gfhg5351kpud1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=e34c9649aa677d5d1c2c7e93daffca12191482b9)

# Cutting-edge innovations turn aluminum into a cornerstone of the green transition, reshaping technology and the future.

Imagine a metal that's as light as it is strong, capable of taking cars further on a single charge and helping planes soar higher with less fuel. Enter aluminum – the unsung hero of the green revolution.

This year, aluminum isn't just playing a supporting role in the shift to sustainability; it's stealing the spotlight, driving innovations that are making our world lighter, faster, and a whole lot greener.

From electric vehicles pushing the limits of range and efficiency, to the high-capacity batteries driving them farther, and the aerospace industry's relentless pursuit of lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft, aluminum is at the core of these technological leaps. It is proving to be a game-changer, powering innovations that are shaping a sustainable future.

This versatile metal has evolved far beyond recycled soda cans, now sitting at the heart of innovations driving advancements in energy storage, transportation, and beyond. Aluminum is enabling technologies crucial for a sustainable future.

Its unique combination of strength, lightness, and recyclability makes aluminum indispensable in the race to cut carbon emissions and build a sustainable future. However, achieving a truly green aluminum industry comes with its own set of challenges.

Traditional aluminum production is energy-intensive, with smelting processes historically responsible for significant greenhouse gas emissions – a challenge central to the green paradox. Balancing the demand for this versatile metal with the need to reduce its environmental footprint is a complex dilemma that the industry is only beginning to unravel.

However, recent technological advancements are beginning to shift this narrative. Innovations like carbon-free smelting, advanced batteries, cutting-edge alloys, and more are redefining aluminum's role across various industries.

Aluminum's influence spans multiple industries, particularly in automotive, where its weight-reducing properties enhance both electric and internal combustion vehicles.

By lightening the load, aluminum directly contributes to increased range for EVs and improved fuel efficiency for traditional vehicles. This is especially critical as automakers strive to meet stringent emissions targets while also catering to the growing demand for more efficient and longer-range vehicles.

Similarly in the aerospace industry, where every pound spared can result in substantial fuel savings, aluminum is an essential material.

Modern aircraft are increasingly incorporating aluminum alloys that offer a superior strength-to-weight ratio, enhancing both performance and fuel efficiency. The development of aluminum-scandium alloys, for example, is pushing the boundaries of what's possible, offering stronger, lighter components that are critical for next-generation aircraft.

As the world accelerates toward a greener future, aluminum stands out as a material that's not only adaptable and resilient but also central to the technologies driving this change. Its versatility, combined with ongoing innovations in production and application, ensures that aluminum will continue to play a pivotal role in shaping a sustainable future-whether it's in the air, on the road, or beyond.

# Domestic shortcomings

In 2024, aluminum continues to be one of the most critical materials in the global push toward sustainability. With its unique properties, this metal is integral not only to automotive and aerospace industries but also to construction, consumer goods, as well as future renewables, making it a cornerstone of modern technology and infrastructure.

Feeding enough aluminum to meet the demand of these diverse industries requires a substantial supply of this increasingly critical metal. In 2023, the apparent domestic consumption of aluminum in the U.S. was around 4 million metric tons. However, this figure doesn't fully capture the total aluminum brought into the country.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.8 million metric tons of crude and semi-manufactured aluminum. With the country being 44% reliant on these imports, this data suggests that actual consumption may be higher than reported, or that a portion of the imported aluminum is being stockpiled, exported, or otherwise allocated for future use.

Regardless of the actual number, the U.S. currently operates only five primary aluminum smelters, and from those, produced around 19% of the apparent consumption last year, approximately 750,000 metric tons.

Although not as reliant as some of the other critical minerals, this limited domestic production highlights another possible vulnerability in the supply chain. As global demand for aluminum continues to grow, this dependence poses risks not only to national security but also to the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions.

# Green paradox

In the world of materials science and industrial production, a complex issue known as the ""green paradox"" has long been recognized.

The green paradox refers to the irony that materials essential for advancing green technologies often come with significant environmental and social costs in their production – negating at least some of their potential benefits.

This concept is a recurring theme not just for aluminum, but for numerous critical materials like lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, copper, and nickel.

Things like EVs, solar panels, wind turbines, advanced batteries, and even the electrical grids that support renewable energy infrastructure all rely heavily on these critical minerals. Without them, the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future simply wouldn't be possible.

Despite the undeniable benefits they offer, the extraction and processing of these materials often comes at a steep environmental cost. Aluminum and copper mining are energy-intensive and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, while lithium and cobalt extraction can lead to water depletion and are strongly tinged with ethical concerns.

Hence, a paradox: they are essential for a greener future, yet their production methods are often anything but green.

# The fire

With a mix of cutting-edge technology and bold ambition, global mining company Rio Tinto is rewriting the rules of aluminum production, turning what was once an environmental risk into an opportunity for innovation by attacking aluminum production from two fronts – by revolutionizing the smelting process itself and the fuel that powers it.

Joining forces with industry leader Alcoa, Rio Tinto is addressing the challenge of carbon emissions from aluminum smelting using an innovative new technology.

Described as the most significant advancement in the aluminum industry in over a century, this technology, known as ELYSIS, replaces the traditional carbon anodes in the electrolytic cells of electric furnaces with proprietary inert anodes.

Instead of producing CO2 as a byproduct, these inert anodes release pure oxygen.

This climate-saving technology is expected to lower production costs by 15% and increase output by the same percentage. Additionally, it can be retrofitted to existing smelters or used to construct new facilities, making it versatile and scalable.

""ELYSIS is a truly disruptive technology for the industry, and it's thanks to Québec expertise that we are the first in the world to produce GHG-free aluminium,"" said Pierre Fitzgibbon, Québec Minister of Economy, Innovation and Energy. ""This is a technological innovation with unprecedented benefits for our aluminium sector, which remains an undisputed world leader.""

As proof of concept, the first deployment of this technology will be built adjacent to the existing Arvida smelter, allowing the use of the current aluminum supply and casting facilities.

Supported by the governments of Canada and Québec, as well as tech giant Apple, this innovative approach to aluminum manufacturing has already been successfully demonstrated at the ELYSIS Industrial Research and Development Center in Saguenay–Lac-St-Jean.

This joint venture between Rio Tinto and Alcoa will continue its research and development program to scale up the ELYSIS technology and has already completed the construction of larger prototype cells designed to be integrated at the end of an existing production line at Rio Tinto's Alma smelter.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey's Mineral Commodity Summaries 2024, the U.S. imported approximately 4.8 million metric tons of crude and semi-manufactured aluminum. With the country being 44% reliant on these imports, this data suggests that actual consumption may be higher than reported, or that a portion of the imported aluminum is being stockpiled, exported, or otherwise allocated for future use.

Regardless of the actual number, the U.S. currently operates only five primary aluminum smelters, and from those, produced around 19% of the apparent consumption last year, approximately 750,000 metric tons.

Although not as reliant as some of the other critical minerals, this limited domestic production highlights another possible vulnerability in the supply chain. As global demand for aluminum continues to grow, this dependence poses risks not only to national security but also to the broader goal of reducing carbon emissions.

# Green paradox

In the world of materials science and industrial production, a complex issue known as the ""green paradox"" has long been recognized.

The green paradox refers to the irony that materials essential for advancing green technologies often come with significant environmental and social costs in their production – negating at least some of their potential benefits.

This concept is a recurring theme not just for aluminum, but for numerous critical materials like lithium, cobalt, rare earth elements, copper, and nickel.

Things like EVs, solar panels, wind turbines, advanced batteries, and even the electrical grids that support renewable energy infrastructure all rely heavily on these critical minerals. Without them, the transition to a sustainable, low-carbon future simply wouldn't be possible.

Despite the undeniable benefits they offer, the extraction and processing of these materials often comes at a steep environmental cost. Aluminum and copper mining are energy-intensive and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, while lithium and cobalt extraction can lead to water depletion and are strongly tinged with ethical concerns.

Hence, a paradox: they are essential for a greener future, yet their production methods are often anything but green. (Article shortened to meet Reddit Post standards)

# Aluminum-scandium alloy

***As it stands, aluminum production is responsible for an estimated 1.1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions each year. Even as one of the world's largest aluminum producers working to reduce that number, the demand for aluminum in new and emerging technologies continues to rise.***

***NioCorp Developments Ltd., a company focused on producing critical minerals for high-tech industries, is at the forefront of developing aluminum-scandium alloy – a material that could redefine performance in automotive and defense applications, as only a small dose of scandium is needed to bolster the strength and toughness of aluminum.***

***Operating the Elk Creek critical minerals project in Nebraska, NioCorp has access to one of the richest scandium deposits in the U.S., alongside niobium, titanium, and rare earth elements.***

***Recognizing the potential of scandium for high-performance applications in the early 2010s, NioCorp has steadily developed the infrastructure and technology needed to produce an alloy that joins together the lightweight, strength, and corrosion resistance of aluminum with the exceptional durability and heat resistance of scandium.***

***Building on this foundation, NioCorp has laid out a three-phase development strategy for the aluminum-scandium master alloy more concretely around 2022. This plan set the stage for pilot-scale production to begin shortly thereafter.***

[NioCorp plans to offer a U.S. supply of aluminum-scandium master alloy for the automotive sector.](https://preview.redd.it/91dc8etkkpud1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d8776c1fa55ba278ef180a473e3872df3f09b9d)

***Collaborating closely with its development partner, Nanoscale Powders LLC, NioCorp has been refining the production process, with an eye toward reaching full-scale commercial production.***

***By late 2024, the company's effort finally bore fruit as it successfully produced scandium metal at a pilot-scale facility in Pennsylvania. This milestone not only demonstrated the feasibility of the production process but also paved the way for the creation of kilogram-sized samples of aluminum-scandium master alloy – later sent to its ""unnamed automaker partners"" for testing.***

***""The progress being made in this phased commercialization effort is important given the rapidly growing interest in scandium alloys across both the commercial transportation sector and in the national defense community,"" said NioCorp Developments Executive Chairman and CEO Mark Smith. ""This successful test demonstrates that we can make scandium metal at a high-enough purity level to proceed directly to the pilot-scale production of kilogram-sized samples of aluminum-scandium master alloy.""***

***From that success, the company remains focused on scaling production, aiming to move from 10-kilogram (22-pound) ingots to 100 kg (220 lb) ingots, ultimately targeting full-scale commercial production.***

***NioCorp's advancements in aluminum-scandium alloys not only exemplify the cutting-edge innovation driving the aluminum industry forward but also underscore the critical role that such materials will play in shaping the future of transportation and defense.***

***As the global demand for aluminum continues to surge, these innovations, alongside those from industry leaders like Rio Tinto, highlight a pivotal shift toward a more sustainable and resilient aluminum industry-one that is essential to powering the technologies of tomorrow while addressing the environmental challenges of today.***

[Through a combination of grants, tax credits, loans, and tariffs, the White House is mobilizing an all-of-government approach to establishing secure and reliable domestic critical mineral supply chains. - \(Shane Lasley for Data Mine North\)](https://preview.redd.it/1w4na5aalpud1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=292aff5d21c788c053193ee449b4881413cc3bb9)

# An all-of-government strategy is beginning to unfold in the US.

Over the first two years following the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. Department of Energy has invested billions of dollars into establishing a clean energy supply chain in the United States. These heavy investments, however, have neglected one vital link – the domestic mines needed to supply the processing facilities, battery plants, and other energy transition infrastructure that DOE has worked so hard to build.

Senators Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., both of which helped to author the domestic mining provisions in the BIL and IRA, are concerned that the White House's strategy is putting the U.S. in a situation where it becomes even more beholden to China and other countries for minerals and metals critical to the clean energy future.

""You've got an administration that is approaching how we deal with this with one hand deliberately tied behind our back – and we are talking about the critical minerals that go into this,"" Murkowski said while questioning DOE Deputy Secretary David Turk during a January Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on EV supply chains.

Turk indicated that DOE's hands are also tied when it comes to supporting domestic battery materials mining projects.

""We are trying to be as creative as possible with the tools and the authorities that we have got,"" the DOE deputy secretary told the committee.

The tools available to DOE were expanded with an updated guidance released in April that allows the department's Loan Programs Office (LPO) to finance domestic critical mineral mining projects under the Title 17 Clean Energy Financing Program.

""The United States has substantial critical minerals resources, but we must do more if we want to lead in the mining or processing of most critical minerals. Many of the supply chains for these minerals are concentrated in just a few countries, most notably China,"" DOE wrote in a post announcing the updated Title 17 guidance. ""This raises risks for investors and businesses, eroding U.S. economic power, weakening our energy security, and increasing our reliance on unreliable foreign sources, which are often produced with lower environmental or labor standards.

Murkowski says the new guidance is a good start.

""What we need now is for the department to go beyond words, beyond funding projects that lock in long-term mineral imports from abroad, and to instead support domestic projects – in states like Alaska – that will strengthen our economy and security,"" Murkowski said.

Thus far, DOE has been reluctant to tap into the roughly $72 billion of loan guarantees available under Title 17 to support domestic mining projects. The U.S. Department of Defense and the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM), however, are leveraging their own authorities to bolster the first link of America's clean energy supply chain.

The DOD grants and EXIM loans are beginning to reveal an all-of-government strategy to establish complete mines-to-clean energy supply chains in the U.S.

# Strategic DOD grants

When compared to the billions of dollars DOE has poured into battery materials processing, manufacturing, and recycling, DOD's investments in domestic critical minerals projects have been relatively small but strategic.

In 2019, then-President Donald Trump authorized the Pentagon to utilize funding available under Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA) – a tool established during the Cold War to ensure the U.S. could secure goods needed for national security – to support the re-establishment of a rare earths supply chain in the U.S.

Over the ensuing five years, DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic rare earth element supply chains. \*\*\*(NOTE: ARTICLE SHORTEND TO MEET REDDIT WORD LIMIT POSTING STANDARDS)

# EXIM does the heavy lifting

The Export-Import Bank of the United States has emerged as the federal government's heavy lifter when it comes to funding domestic critical mineral mining projects.

https://preview.redd.it/e9w14l6olpud1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=8131d75655dd46e364931056ff52dad237aca94e

In April, the export credit agency for the U.S. government extended an offer to loan Perpetua $1.8 billion to fund the development of a mine at its Stibnite Gold project in Idaho that would provide the only domestic source of antimony critical to America's economic and national security.

The antimony to be produced as a byproduct of gold at Stibnite is of strategic interest to the Pentagon, which is why it invested nearly $60 million to advance this mine project from the start.

In a letter inviting Perpetua to submit a loan application, EXIM said the Idaho antimony project may be eligible for funding under the U.S. export bank's ""Make More in America initiative.""

The proposed EXIM loan would provide the funding to build the antimony-gold mine that the Pentagon has backed through the engineering and permitting phases.

""We are seeing a whole of government approach to bring antimony production home,"" said Perpetua Resources President and CEO Jon Cherry. ""From EXIM's potential financing of up to $1.8 billion to the multiple Department of Defense's multi-million-dollar awards to Perpetua, there is a profound recognition that we need domestic antimony production now.""

# A month after the invitation to Perpetua, EXIM offered a similar but smaller $800 million loan to NioCorp Developments Ltd. to fund the development of a mine at the Elk Creek project in Nebraska that would provide a domestic source of 17 minerals deemed critical to the U.S.

# ""Our goal is to make North America less dependent on foreign suppliers for the critical minerals we need to transition to a clean energy and less carbon-centric economy,"" says NioCorp Developments Chairman and CEO Mark Smith.

# To achieve this mission, the company plans to produce niobium and titanium, key ingredients in an emerging rapid-charging solid-state battery technology; scandium used in lightweight and durable alloys for automotive, aerospace, and defense applications; and 14 rare earths essential for numerous high-tech, military, and everyday applications.

# Global automaker Stellantis has already agreed to offtake future neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium produced at Elk Creek. These rare earths are key ingredients in the powerful magnets that go into the motors driving EVs, including electrified versions of the automaker's Jeep, Dodge, and Ram brands that are popular in North America.

# The EXIM loan would cover about two-thirds of the $1.2 billion currently estimated cost to develop Elk Creek. The total costs, however, will likely be higher with the completion of an updated feasibility study for Elk Creek that includes the recovery of rare earths, which is expected later this year.

# ****""As I see it, the stars are increasingly aligning behind our Elk Creek project and 2024 promises to be a momentous year for NioCorp,"" said Smith.******

The stars are also aligning for U.S. Strategic Metals (USSM) and the battery materials mining, processing, and mining project it is developing in neighboring Missouri.

In August, EXIM invited USSM to apply for a $400 million loan to fund the construction of a state-of-the-art plant to recover metals from concentrates and recycled lithium-ion batteries.

This potential loan will add to the nearly $230 million in funding commitments from affiliates of Appian Capital Advisory LLP announced by USSM late last year, as well as around $250 million in previous funding from Glencore and others.

""Appian is excited to partner with USSM to develop its cobalt-nickel mine and battery recycling and mineral processing operation in Missouri,"" said Appian Capital CEO Michael Sherb. ""USSM will shape the battery recycling landscape in the U.S. and play a critical role in establishing a domestic supply of essential minerals for the energy transition.""

I am recovering. Due to therapies and fact that we are from one community that makes events for children, I have decided I will no longer cover for him. When I am directly asked why I wish to avoid him, I say why. When I am directly asked why we did not work out, I say why.

The other day, my former colleague (with whom we grew friendship exceeding friendly coffee every now and then) reached out to me with a job offer, and asked why I was thinking about leaving my current company. I said - because it is hard to work with someone who caused me harm, meeting in office and keeping professional face. The company offer is promising, but I decided I will wait my next promotion cycle in here as I have something to gain career-wise.

My ex came to me and asked if I spoke to mentioned former colleague. Turns out he was also given a job offer, but it was removed after I confessed to our former colleague about the abuse. Ex accused me of sabotaging his career.

I cannot help but feel slightly guilty, although I know I do nothing wrong. It was my experience and I am not lying. It is interesting, however, how the remorse on his side came only after facing consequences.

Sometimes I wonder - am I being too hard on him, by staying firm behind my truth? But then I see some of the photos of my bruised arms and legs and know this is the right way, because this is not normal. Nobody should suffer this.

It’s the first holiday meal without my mom, so I was looking forward hosting my dad and having family time together in the absence of mom, since she always loved bringing us together for family dinners. 

My dad has recently talked about dating again, and when he got into town on Friday night, he said he had a dinner date on Saturday evening. I figured he’d be gone maybe 3 hours, but his date ran 6 hours. On Sunday afternoon, he said he was meeting the woman again for coffee. I asked him what time and he said she wanted to meet at 3:30pm; I know he told her we were having a holiday meal together because he said she doesn’t celebrate Thanksgiving in her culture. I asked him to move it earlier so he could be back for dinner and they agreed to 2pm. As he was leaving, he said he might not be back in time for the meal and to start without him, but I told him that I planned and prepared this meal for him and expected him to be back for 5:30pm. He agreed.

At 5:32pm, he texted me saying he’d be missing dinner. We had another guest so I maintained my composure, despite my child asking where his grandfather was and our guest asked if we wanted to wait for my dad. He finally walked in at 6:30pm as my child was heading up for bed. After the guest left, my dad said he was going to meet the woman for breakfast before he leaves town today. And that’s when I snapped. I understand he wants to date again and I want to support him, but his timing really sucks: I’m trying to keep it together as I grieve this first holiday meal without my mom and I expected my dad would be here to help us make a nice memory for it. I understand he didn’t expect to have this kind of connection with this woman, but he skipped a family holiday meal (that I spent the past week and a half planning and preparing at 36 weeks pregnant) to spend time with some woman he just met. 

He apologized, but it was half-assed and it was only because I addressed him about this. I’m angry, I’m sad, but most of all, I’m just really disappointed. He’s planning to be back after the baby arrives, but I honestly don’t know if I want him here.",2,1728905559.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1g3dimv,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1g3dimv/is_it_the_coffee_or_caffeine_or_the_combination/,Is it the coffee or caffeine or the combination of the two?,"I stopped drinking coffee because of the hellish anxiety it gave me in the evening. I went from these high highs to feeling like the world was against me in every way conceivable from 5pm until sleep time. 

So, I experimented with no coffee but substituting in caffeine pills. This came with the benefit of the energy feeling cleaner but now I was taking in considerably more caffeine at 400mg a day from my original two cups of coffee a day. 

I convinced myself that the caffeine had no significant negative effects on my system but as the years have worn on I have wondered if my joint pain, low level anxiety (albeit much more manageable than the coffee induced anxiety), and weak erections are linked to my heavy caffeine use. 

Recently I switched to other hot non-caffeinated beverages and I have begun to taper down on my caffeine consumption. I am currently at half that regular dose at 200mg a day. Naturally I am feeling tired, brain fog, but surprisingly my sexual health seems to be improving especially in the morning. I am also sleeping throughout the night too which has been rare for me. I also feel like my strength in the gym is starting to pick up despite not feeling that original oomf from the caffeine. An odd benefit is that I am feeling my body in a more tactile way. It is very difficult to describe. Perhaps someone could explain better. 

Many folks on this forum have seen tremendous benefits from quitting caffeine altogether but they have done so by switching to decaf or just quitting coffee in total. 

How much of the benefits that are felt from quitting caffeine are from quitting coffee completely and how much from quitting caffeine? 

Side question: Has anyone felt like the inflammation in their joints has improved dramatically since quitting caffeine? (My diet is high fat and low carb. No refined sugars. My supplements and training are optimized.)",1,1728905422.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

due to depression and bereavement of my father dying, it took longer than it should have. But my bungalow is coming along.

1g3dezp,https://www.reddit.com/r/ebikes/comments/1g3dezp/would_really_appreciate_advice/,Would really appreciate advice ,"Hey everyone! 

I know there are a lot of posts like this so I really appreciate yall reading and offering any advice! 

My husband and I share one car at the moment and we have a 2 yo. We have been looking at new cars but have just been crapping ourselves at the prices right now even for used cars. We just can't afford a car payment right now.

My husband rode a motorcycle for years while we were dating and we've decided we are going to get him a motorcycle for his commute to work which will be a million times cheaper than a car at this point.

However my issue is that he is a nurse and works 3 12s, so he'll be home with our daughter for 3 of my work days every week. I work from home but I like to commute to a coffee shop 1-2x a week so I don't lose my ever loving mind. I also like to go to a yoga studio that's right by the coffee shop. I also think it would be really nice to take the bike to yoga so I can boost my workout and add in some good cardio. I want my husband to have the car on these days so he can take our daughter places and will have the ability to drive to the hospital for emergencies.

We considered that I could learn how to drive his motorcycle but he is concerned for my safety and quite frankly I'm not sure I want to risk it out there as a novice now that I'm a mom/ may have a future pregnancy 😂

ANYWAYS, our solution is that I get a bike, and he gets a motorcycle, these two things combined will still be way cheaper than a car. Plus- I have been wanting a bike for years- for recreational purposes. I did buy a bike 5 years back, but money was super tight so I got a basic one from Walmart, and it sucked so bad the gears wouldn't even shift properly. 

I have been doing research and went to a bike shop yesterday and honestly I'm getting so overwhelmed and stressed out. I was about to buy a lectric bike, but then I saw people on this Reddit saying to not buy a lectric bike. I'm so anxious about blowing a bunch of money on something and then it sucking and having regret. We really need to be as frugal as possible right now.

Here is what I'm looking for:

COMMUTE: my commute would be 8 miles round trip, a very small portion on the road and then mostly on a really pretty paved bike trail. Pretty much totally flat (Texas).
I think it's important to note that this commute would be 2x a week at most and if I ever needed to just stay home or take the car for whatever reason, I could. 
I would also use the bike just for fun rides on the weekends, etc. so maybe 30 miles a week at the absolute max.

WHAT I NEED: 
-I would like the bike to have a very comfortable seat (which I know can be swapped out). 

-I strongly prefer that I could tow my daughter in a trailer on occasion, but it's not necessarily needed. I do NOT care about speed or any of that type of thing. 

-I would like it to be reliable and good quality but as affordable as possible. 

-I prefer big tires and don't want one of those bikes that has tiny tires.

-I do not want to have to click my shoes in

- if it can fold it would be a huge plus, as I could put it in our trunk if needed. However seems like people on here hate folding bikes?

- I would consider myself athletic-ish and willing to get a good workout in

TLDR; I'm looking for a basic e bike, just something that's good quality and reliable, for absolute max 30 miles a week. Need it to be as affordable as possible. Mostly riding on paved trail. I do want it to be a cardio workout but like that an e bike will allow me to chill more on off days/ help me tow my daughter. Was about to buy a lectric but now I'm second guessing that because of reviews on here. I did look at the Yamaha one but there's a wait for shipping and I'm inpatient 😂

1g3dbh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g3dbh8/aitah_for_telling_my_mentally_ill_housemate_to/,AITAH FOR TELLING MY MENTALLY ILL HOUSEMATE TO CLEAN?,"I (F27) am living with two housemates who I'll call Lena (34F) and Jess (30F) 
Lena is an indigenous trans woman who has been confronted by a lot of struggles in life that I would never experience. She is a Uni student with ADHD and really struggling to keep on top of her school work. She currently has a fragile mental state due to her life experiences and stress from school. 
Lena has expressed in previous crying breakdowns that she's so grateful Jess and myself don't mention the mess/clutter she leaves everywhere because of her ADHD as it would be triggering for her. She sees us ignoring it and cleaning for her as an act of 'mutual support' during a tough time. She once got annoyed when Jess moved her stuff off the coffee table so I've avoided touching Lena's things all together nowadays. 

I was trying to think of ways I could mention cleaning without upsetting her as common spaces of the house have become unusable. I casually mentioned wanting to be able to use the dining table (every surface of the house is covered in her stuff) and she did clean her stuff of it but covered it again a day later. 
I also mentioned when she was on uni break us all having a big spring clean to get the house up to a nice standard which she said would be a good idea. 
Uni break has now come and she didn't do her work during the semester so is having to do it now during her break which she is spiralling about. So the spring cleaning never came to fruition. 

This mess has been escalating as Lena leaves takeaway boxes, used cups and milkshakes out for long periods of time and I have stopped throwing them out for her. It's become not just clutter but unhygienic and I have seen cockroaches as the weather warms. As an example I opened a drawer in the lounge yesterday and discovered an empty chocolate mousse container with a spoon still in it sitting there. Lena said she put it in there when she was stoned so her cat wouldn't get into it.

Everything came to a head today. I've been working 7 days a week across two jobs so I slept in on my one day off between shifts and woke up to a group chat message from Lena saying we have carpet beetles in the lounge and that we'll need to deep clean blankets/pillows, the furniture and vacuum. Lena is on a deadline for Uni so said she couldn't help.  
 
Jess floated the idea of creating a cleaning roster which I said was a good idea as I have been seeing cockroaches around and the state of the house is becoming a health issue. 
I didn't say this but I also thought it was a good idea as Jess has been doing a lot of the cleaning as I've given up touching anything that doesn't belong to me which is unfair for Jess especially. 
Lena said that we weren't prioritising properly and just to worry about the beetles for now avoiding the conversation about a cleaning roster all together. 
I got up and Lena was sitting in the lounge still doing Uni work. I moved Lena's clothes from the laundry basket (had been sitting in the communal laundry basket for weeks and weeks) and collected the cushions and blankets to start washing them. 
While they were in the wash I started busying myself as I couldn't do more about the beetles in the lounge while Lena was in there. I didn't want to disrupt her work. 

I started taking out the recycling and discovered a moldy loaf of bread behind it which made me gag. I also took out the rubbish bin and discovered Lena's cat food stuck to the bottom of it festering which again.. made me gag. I still took it outside and scrubbed it clean though.

I sent some messages to the chat about what I was cleaning so Jess knew she didn't have to do them when she was home. Jess popped home to do the dishes before going out again and expressed she was also frustrated at the state of the house but didn't know how to say anything as she is afraid of conflict. 

Lena disappeared from the lounge and hid in her room with her cat (I felt like she was hiding from the cleaning and how visibly unhappy I was but maybe that wasn't her intention) 

I started trying to move Lena's clutter from the lounge so I could vacuum as the carpet beetles seemed urgent and Jess/Lena said they couldn't vacuum and clean the lounge until two days from now. The more I moved the more gross things I discovered underneath and eventually was so disgusted I gave up. As Mina was in her room I couldn't talk to her about it and sent this message to the group chat -

""I'm moving clutter around so I can vacuum the lounge and I keep uncovering gross stuff. I don't want to be the bad guy and I've tried to be patient but I have hit my breaking point with how unhygienic and gross the house has gotten. It's at the point where we can't use common spaces because of the sheer amount of stuff on every surface and we're attracting multiple types of pests. We need to work as a team and find a resolution so we can all have a decent living standard at home. I have hit my absolute limit and am spending my one day off cleaning gag worthy stuff that I haven't created.
This is a deal breaker and I don't want to move but will if this is how we're expected to live.
I'm not going to keep cleaning all this by myself today so I'm stopping. I will continue washing the blankets and pillows cases though."" 

This I think is what gave Lena a panic attack and she eventually responded with -

""If you’re feeling this strongly about the state of the house OP then it sounds like we need to have a house meeting to try and address some unresolved tension. I’ve been proud of the way we’ve quietly supported each other during a very turbulent period up until this point. We’ve all had a lot on our plate and sadly the house has paid the price for that. 

I will say that I’ve cleaned up some pretty unpleasant messes that I haven’t created since I’ve been here, but I know we’ve all been going through it so I considered it an act of mutual support to just get on with it until we were in a place where we could address the state of the house and the division of labour. I’m also very aware that my ADHD creates a lot of clutter and I know you’ve both been patient with me in that regard while I’ve worked towards creating space in my own life to try and address that and many other things, so I’ve tried to reciprocate where I can by doing little things like cleaning the toilet regularly, doing the bathroom sink, doing the shower and bath etc. when I’m home alone. 

Either way, I’ve already had one panic attack tonight and don’t fancy another, so I’m going to request that we leave this for tonight. Ingrid and I have already planned to do the whole house on Thursday to deal with the carpet bugs and we can discuss the house meeting another day."" 

Here's where I may have been the asshole. I felt like we were continuing to ignore and not resolve an issue Jess and I have been tiptoeing around for months until it absolutely could not be ignored anymore and a bug infestation wasn't something we could leave for days so I kept responding which maybe I shouldn't have - 

""I understand there are extenuating circumstances and I have been very patient and tried to provide as much support as possible. I'm sorry this is such a serious subject of stress for you but we can't avoid talking about it as we have been because it has escalated to becoming a health issue. I will give you as much space as possible but this is a reasonable need I am expressing."" 

Lena responded -

""Yes, wanting to address the state of the house is a reasonable request. So is ‘can we not tackle this tonight in this way - I’m having a menty b.’ I didn’t say I don’t want to talk about it - we need to. I opened and finished that message with ‘it sounds like we need to have a house meeting.’

I think it’s more concerning if this is how we are going to navigate conflict resolution as a house. When I said ‘I think we have a carpet bug problem’ I wasn’t  blaming anyone - I was just letting everyone now because, primarily, my main concern was everyone’s stuff being destroyed

Tension and conflicting lifestyles are part of any sharehouse experience and yes - things haven’t been good - but if this is the roadmap for resolution then I think we have more to discuss than just cleaning rosters""

It felt to me that Lena was framing me being upset and expressing it as a worse offense than anything I was upset at her about about once again side stepping and deflecting from the cleaning issue without taking steps to resolve it 

So I responded -
""Lena, we can put a pin in this and discuss another time as I said 'i will give you as much space as possible' if conflict resolution is the issue you want to focus on instead we can do that at the house meeting but things will need to be resolved in the near future before things get destroyed by pests."" 

Jess chimed in and said -

""hey tīma, we should def book in some time to have a sit down and discuss this in person, i feel that messaging doesn't always allow for the best communication. hope yall have a cosy night x"" 

Which she was right and I started to feel like I might be being awful for getting upset about Lena's ADHD symptoms. I didn't think I was being angry or cruel but maybe I was coming across that way? We didn't have any face to face discussions as Lena was in her room so everything I said is in this post. I felt guilty for triggering Lena and appearing unsupportive so I sent this -

 ""@Lena, I'm sorry I'm not trying to attack you and still love and respect you. I hope we can get on the same page with conflict resolution and communication also so we can have a comfortable  space to express these needs to each other before it issues escalate to being unignorable as this one has."" 

Lena didn't respond and I think I heard her crying 

Does anyone with ADHD have advice on how I should better handle these kinds of situations before they get to this point? As of now the house is still disgusting and I've caused a 'menty b' as Lena put it. So I don't feel like I've won anything or resolved the issue. Am I the asshole? ",6,1728904634.0,AITAH,40,1.0,False

I'm the only one from the four of us who sleeps at a somewhat decent time (11pm to 8am). I've had insomnia since I was a teenager so even in complete darkness and silence going to sleep and staying alsleep is hard for me. My 3 roommates always come back well after midnight and even though they try to keep silent I wake up every single time. In the morning I can't get anything done bc they sleep until noon, so I can't make breakfast or coffee (the kitchen is practically a concrete hole in the wall so that's sorta out of question).

During daytime when I'm trying to study one of them is always in the room packing stuff very loud, clanking with dishes and crackling plastic bags that make it impossible to study bc I can hear it through earphones.

I have very sensitive ears, I always wear headphones but I can hear everything they do through it so I can't really rest or study bc the noise is irritating. They just can't do anything silently.

I tried to tell them to please turn the lights off at 11 pm, bc I have classes from 10 am that I have to rest for. I have to ask them EVERY NIGHT to keep quiet and turn off the lights but I started to feel really bad, bc I keep nagging them over and over again. I feel like a Karen for it bc I'm the only one who's cranky all the time due to the poor sleep and the irritation that the noise causes me.

What should I do? Do I sit them down for a big talk? Keep nagging them? 

Unfortunately I need the dorm room a lot, I don't have a good living situation at home, but I can't exist like this. Everything they do just irritates me and I don't know why.

2.5 months ago i had a big pain in my chest and i was thinking about some stomach problem. Then the pain came to just under my hearth and ribs i couldnt fight with and head to er. They run test and find 5400 lipase with sludge in gallbladder. They offer me gallbladder removal but I refused because my wife 7 months pregnant. Also I wasn't sure I asked them are you sure gallbladder is the problem they said suspect is gallbladder, now you dont have and infection we can do it. But it doesnt make sense to me and I sign the papers I left to ER. When I arrived home doctor call me from my phone he said we run your blood test again, labs was wrong my lipase is 540 which is nice and no need surgery strick with diet. I said okey and sleep well ( i went to hospital 9 pm and came home 6 am). I woke up around 1 pm and i check my chart app and i saw my lipase tedt result change again ( they run another test with same blood) and it is final result 7400 lipase. I call ER they said please come back here immeadilately. I went there another test and result was 700ish. 2 weeks with pain I couldnt eat anything and I call gastroentrology they said nothing to do with us, call GI for galbladder removal. I call surgery doctor we did a visit he explain me. Then couple days later I had another big pain i couldnt sleep sweating all night next day i went to ER again. They run tests and now my AST ALT  was over 1500 and lipase 746. Also they check my gallbladder they said it is look like normal no inflamation some small stones (ct scan and ultrasound). They said might be some sludge on common bile or stone need ercp mrcp test. And this time I said yes for surgery and everythung and they sent me another hospital same night. I was waiting they going to do me some ercp or mrcp to me but then my surgery doctor came and said no need ercp they gonna remove my gallbladder and FL scan after that. And after the surgery they said my common bile clear. Doctor did not give me any diet and said eat whatever you want. I was shocking and I didnt eat first day. Couple days later i start to eat 3 months ago like fatty foods. Then my all pain come back and end it up in ER. They run blood test again everything was normal except lipase. It was 1470 this time. Same recommendation stay clear liquid . It was 15 days ago and i still have pain. And i fight all this pain without any pain drug from begining. Still 20 opioid sitting on bag. From the begining it wasnt gallbladder it was pancreas. I read a lot and now i am scarred. Because now it is 2.5 months past with this high lipase levels, still pain happening and last time luckly they sent me to mri and they saw some fatty psrt of my pacreas has infection. All ducts are clear biles are ok. But 2.5 months it is too much and make me nervous. Am I eveluated to CP now ? Because still pain in my chest under ribs.i didnt eat anything last 3 days only 1 cup coffee per day and 2 cup apple juice. This night i ate half bread (homemade no oil no sugar inside kind of lavash or pita-naan) and i have big pain in my chest and i cant sleep now 4 am.

1g3d6fm,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g3d6fm/she_didnt_lose_feelings_but_i_was_awful/,"She didn't lose feelings, but I was awful.","My (24F) girlfriend broke up with me (24M) after a 4.5 year-long relationship. She's my first ever girlfriend, and I was her first ever boyfriend. We also lived together inside a studio apartment owned by my parents for the past 2 years.

Long story short, I became everything I hate. Working a remote job that I hate, went from a healthy 175lbs to 250lbs, when I didn't work, I slept most of the day (I can only work 2nd and 3rd shifts while she works 1st), and played video games. I don't have a social group and I never did. Maybe a friend or two that I occasionally see. I was insanely lazy and procrastinated all the time. I ran away from responsibility, she wanted kids and planning our future, I didn't even put a second of thought into it and would just delay the talk or say 'I don't know' because I was scared of exiting this comfort zone and becoming a responsible man she can rely on. To be fair, most of my life was like this, alone and sad with no goal in mind. Our love is real, but she was suffering. She tried everything she could for 2 years, even went to a psychologist on my behalf to see how she could help me. She'd ask me to go outside on Friday or Saturday, go for a walk or to a nice concert, I would keep and keep denying because I was uncomfortable in my own skin. I despised myself but I never did anything about it. I wanted change, but I was too lazy to fight for it. I allowed laziness and comfort to conquer me.

She became resentful, and I didn't do anything beside offer promises of change, and then loop back in that vicious cycle I called life. I was coasting through life.

The pain I felt after we broke up was immeasurable. Something flipped in me. Not for her, I was sick of losing every battle I take. I got sick of being a loser. I sat down and starting reading David Goggins' book. I made a routine I religiously follow. I go to the gym 3x days a week, run 6x days a week, cycle for 6x days a week, wake up at 5am, quit my job, I am looking for a new one. I am preparing myself for a half-marathon (I HATE RUNNING). I started developing a better relationship with my parents and I am actually enjoying it. I am proud of myself. I never said that myself. I am doing things I believed to be impossible. Fat MF running for 4 miles at 6am in the morning? I start gasping for air after 500 yards, but I ush myself and give myself ultimatums. I will not stop my pre-planned run even if it means dying out of a stroke. I'd rather die fighting for myself for the first time in my life than to stop. Waking up at 5am? Reading books I always hated reading and enjoying them? Going to psychotherapy every week? Stopped playing video games. I became obsessed with pushing my limits. I am pushing through pain.

But I also have this glimmer of hope that she can forgive me and go for a coffee after a month or so.. 1 day after breakup I start texting her and she denied me saying she's tired, needs space, and that she became resentful. That she lost herself in our relationship. We had beatifu lmoments. We were full of understanding. I'd listen to her whenever she needed me. I'd be there. I'd cook for her. I'd try to put up a fight for her, but I always failed after a couple of days at max.

Day 2 she called saying she's hurt and asking me how am I. I broke down and told her that I truly flipped a switch but she didn't listen and said she made up her mind and that shes sorry that she called me and wishes me all the best. We agreed on no contact for an undefined period.

Fast forward to yesterday, I shipped all her remaining stuff (fridge, microwave, some personal belongings, etc.) and paid for the transport to another city to her family. I took extra care to bubble-wrap everything and neatly put them into boxes. Clean the fridge, the microwave, her desk. That's the man I want to be. I think that's the right thing to do. And then, her father called me, crying and saying how sorry he is and asked me how I am doing. I was doing something, so he asked if it'd be okay to talk tomorrow. I don't even know what to think anymore. She's amazing, her family is amazing and I am such a fucking idiot for allowing myself to become what I became. But I am no longer than man. I am no longer going to coast through life. I have already made changes and I am sticking to them, no matter how much it hurts and how unmotivated I am. I dropped 10lbs in a week (I know it's not healthy, but I am obsessed with change). I am fully disciplined.

She still loves me and I love her. She told me that after a breakup. Do you think it'd be okay after respecting her wishes for space to text her in a month or so and ask her how she's doing and maybe ask to arrange a coffee meetup with no obligations? To talk about what happened in the period following the breakup? To see how we feel then?",1,1728904051.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I know, I know, a slip-on steel toe boot sounds a little too good to be true, but hear me out.

First off, **comfort**. These boots felt like they were custom-made for my feet. I work in construction, so my feet are used to suffering. I’m talking blisters, sore toes, and general foot misery by the end of the day. But with these SUREWAY boots, my feet have never been happier. The fact that they're slip-ons also means no more wrestling with laces in the morning when I’m still half-asleep.

**Durability**? These bad boys hold up. I’ve dropped all sorts of things on my feet (the joys of construction), and the steel toes did their job every time. One time, I was carrying a stack of drywall, and it slipped right onto my foot. Normally, this would’ve had me limping for days, but nope – these boots saved me, and I kept on working like nothing happened. Well, I did take a 5-minute coffee break because, you know, why not?

Now, let’s talk about **waterproofing**. I live in a rainy area, so this is a big one for me. These boots have kept my feet dry even after hours in puddles and mud. I mean, sure, the rest of me is soaked, but at least my toes are cozy.

**I GOT MINE FOR CHEAP** [**HERE**](https://amzn.to/4eHaGhe)

And here's a little **bonus**: I never thought I’d say this, but they actually look pretty good too. My wife even said, “Wow, you’re wearing those to work?” – and that’s coming from someone who thinks my usual work gear makes me look like a cave troll.

One funny moment: My buddy at work noticed my boots and asked if I was trying to “fancy up” the construction site. He was joking, of course, but after seeing how comfortable and tough they were, he ordered a pair the next day.

So, if you’re in the market for the *best steel toe boots*, give the [SUREWAY Men’s Slip-On Work Boots](https://amzn.to/4eHaGhe) a shot. Your feet (and possibly your marriage) will thank you!",1,1728903788.0,redditsreviewed,0,1.0,False

It's slop. It is actual, irredeemable slop. Polite British society rallied around it and do to this day! Reading it makes me feel like I am taking crazy pills. The trial did however deliver an all time quote from the prosecutor:

""Would you approve of your young sons, young daughters—because girls can read as well as boys—reading this book? Is it a book you would have lying around your own house? Is it a book that you would even wish your wife or your servants to read?""

\`You've got a baby in her all right.'

For the last few months, I've been largely ignoring technologies that didn't exist in 1989. Almost everything I consider to be a real world daily luxury existed in 1989. Indoor plumbing, hot water, heating and air conditioning, dishwashers, microwave ovens, refrigeration, electric guitars, washers and dryers, coffee makers, ovens and stoves, vacuum cleaners, etc. all existed in 1989.

Since then, little if any innovations have positively impacted my daily life, so I'm ignoring most of it.

There are some steampunky things I'm still doing, like I have a smartphone, but use it more like a 1980s land line phone connected to an answering machine. It sits as far away from me as possible in whatever room I'm in; even it's even in the same rooms as I. 

Until a couple of weeks ago, if my kids didn't insist on using text and if land lines weren't more complicated than smart phones, I would have ditched it for a flip phone.

The ""as far away from me as possible"" solution is working well, though. With just a glance, I can see what time it is and whether I have any notifications because I keep it plugged in and the lock screen displayed with large text. This is not dissimilar to a 1980s phone.

However, I've begun to re-introduce using my smartphone as an alarm (brush teeth, prepare lunch) and timer (meditation, gym rest/work intervals, cooking); now that I've discontinued using my smart watch due to EMF pollution. I researched dedicated function stopwatches, but not surprisingly they are all rated fairly poorly.

I (F, 20) started Elvanse 5 weeks ago after being diagnosed with ADHD - predominantly inattentive. 
Started on 30mg, was amazing. I felt like someone had turned the tv down on my life and everything made so much sense, nothing felt overwhelming. It was the feeling I had always wanted.

A week later I then went up to 50mg. At first I didn’t really feel a difference, and then after a week it definitely kicked in. I still felt fine though - more relaxed, concentration and focus was amazing. If I started something best believe I HAD to finish it before starting something else! My anxiety was a little higher than it had been on the 30mg, but I’m generally anxious anyway due to overwhelm (another lovely ADHD symptom) so I wasn’t too worried. I know this can be a common side effect when first starting Elvanse anyway. 

Only downside was I started really struggling to fall asleep. My clinician thought it was something to do with my meds wearing off to quickly, which made sense, so popped me up to the 70mg to give me an extra boost. 

This is where I started to have a negative experience. My anxiety has gone INSANE. I literally cannot sit still. I feel dizzy, whole body feels like I’m shaking. I HAVE to be concentrating on something if not I just go into a major panic. It feels like I haven’t eaten anything and surviving the day on about 12 really strong coffees. I honestly felt like this is what being high feels like. It was really scary. 

I was on it for a week, and yesterday was so bad. I decided to go back down to the 50mg today as I had some left over, and I’ve asked for an urgent appointment with my clinician.

I still feel quite anxious and on edge today even on the 50mg. Really fidgety and stuff. Nowhere near as bad as yesterday, so I’m probably just generally anxious due to what I’ve experienced over the last week.

Has this happened to anyone else? I feel so stupid and silly for not being able to “handle” the 70mg. I’m worried that what if the 30mg is really all I need - is that gonna make me look like a fraud? Like I’ve wasted everyone’s time? Idk. I just hope they don’t take me off it because up until the 70, it’s given me everything I’ve ever wanted.

","Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels is crucial for overall well-being, especially for individuals who are prediabetic, diabetic, or those looking to support better metabolic health. Supplements like **Gluco6** claim to offer natural and effective ways to regulate blood sugar and improve overall health. In this comprehensive guide, we’ll dive deep into what Gluco6 is, how it works, its ingredients, benefits, potential side effects, customer reviews, pricing, and more. Let’s explore if Gluco6 is truly a solution for blood sugar management.

# [Click Here To Gluco6 official Website+ 60-day money-back guarantee​​](https://shorturl.at/gPdao)

# What is Gluco6?​

**Gluco6** is a dietary supplement formulated to help individuals manage their blood sugar levels naturally. The product is designed for people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or those looking to maintain healthy glucose levels. It contains a blend of natural ingredients, including herbs, vitamins, and minerals, each selected for their ability to regulate blood sugar, support insulin sensitivity, and improve metabolic health.

# Key Features of Gluco6:​

* **Natural Ingredients:** Gluco6 combines plant extracts and essential minerals known for their potential to balance glucose levels.
* **Non-Habit Forming:** The supplement is free from stimulants or addictive compounds, making it safe for long-term use.
* **Designed for Blood Sugar Support:** Each ingredient in Gluco6 is selected for its known role in supporting glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

# How Does Gluco6 Work?​

The effectiveness of Gluco6 lies in its ability to target multiple aspects of blood sugar management. It works through several mechanisms to support healthy glucose levels and promote better metabolic health:

# 1. Enhancing Insulin Sensitivity:​

One of the primary functions of Gluco6 is to improve insulin sensitivity. Insulin is the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake into cells. When cells become insulin resistant, blood sugar levels rise, which can lead to prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Ingredients like Berberine and Chromium in Gluco6 are known to enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to manage glucose levels more effectively.

# 2. Reducing Glucose Absorption:​

Gluco6 contains ingredients like Gymnema Sylvestre and Cinnamon Bark, which are known to inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines. This results in lower blood sugar spikes after meals and more stable glucose levels throughout the day.

# 3. Supporting Insulin Production:​

Certain ingredients in Gluco6, such as Bitter Melon, stimulate insulin production from the pancreas. This can be especially beneficial for individuals whose insulin production has decreased over time due to poor dietary habits or underlying health conditions.

# 4. Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress:​

Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are often linked to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. Ingredients like Alpha Lipoic Acid and Berberine help reduce inflammation and oxidative damage, further promoting better blood sugar control.

Let’s dive into the details and uncover what you need to know.

# 👉👉[ Click here to order Gluco6 and experience the benefits!](https://shorturl.at/gPdao)

# Understanding Gluco6: What Is It Really?

**Gluco6** is marketed as a revolutionary supplement designed to support blood sugar levels and potentially reverse type 2 diabetes. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on medication, diet, and exercise, this product offers a new approach. According to the information available, Gluco6 utilizes a unique blend of ingredients to address what’s claimed to be the root cause of diabetes.

# The Claims: What Does Gluco6 Promise?

Gluco6 claims to tackle diabetes from a novel angle. It suggests that the root cause of diabetes is not solely poor diet or lack of exercise but rather a malfunctioning protein. By targeting this key protein, the supplement aims to stabilize blood sugar levels and even reverse the condition. Sounds intriguing, right?

# How Does Gluco6 Work? The Secret Behind the Formula

The formula behind Gluco6 is centered around a so-called “unique type of sugar” or “Sudanese blood sugar secret.” This ingredient is purported to interact with the body’s systems in a way that stabilizes glucose levels. While the specifics of this ingredient are not fully disclosed, it’s claimed to have undergone extensive testing with promising results.

A significant part of Gluco6’s appeal lies in the success stories shared by users. Many have reported positive changes in their blood sugar levels and overall health. Tony Bailey, the spokesperson for the supplement, claims personal success in reversing his type 2 diabetes using this product.

# The Controversy: Why Is This Information Suppressed?

Gluco6’s promotional materials suggest that the supplement’s potential benefits are being suppressed by pharmaceutical companies and media outlets. This claim is based on the idea that these entities would lose out on revenue if a non-drug solution were widely adopted. While it’s common for new treatments to face skepticism, it’s crucial to approach such claims with a critical eye.

# What is Gluco6?​

**Gluco6** is a dietary supplement formulated to help individuals manage their blood sugar levels naturally. The product is designed for people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, or those looking to maintain healthy glucose levels. It contains a blend of natural ingredients, including herbs, vitamins, and minerals, each selected for their ability to regulate blood sugar, support insulin sensitivity, and improve metabolic health.

# Key Features of Gluco6:​

* **Natural Ingredients:** Gluco6 combines plant extracts and essential minerals known for their potential to balance glucose levels.
* **Non-Habit Forming:** The supplement is free from stimulants or addictive compounds, making it safe for long-term use.
* **Designed for Blood Sugar Support:** Each ingredient in Gluco6 is selected for its known role in supporting glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity.

# How Does Gluco6 Work?​

The effectiveness of Gluco6 lies in its ability to target multiple aspects of blood sugar management. It works through several mechanisms to support healthy glucose levels and promote better metabolic health:

# 1. Enhancing Insulin Sensitivity:​

One of the primary functions of Gluco6 is to improve insulin sensitivity. Insulin is the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels by facilitating glucose uptake into cells. When cells become insulin resistant, blood sugar levels rise, which can lead to prediabetes or type 2 diabetes. Ingredients like Berberine and Chromium in Gluco6 are known to enhance insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to manage glucose levels more effectively.

# 2. Reducing Glucose Absorption:​

Gluco6 contains ingredients like Gymnema Sylvestre and Cinnamon Bark, which are known to inhibit glucose absorption in the intestines. This results in lower blood sugar spikes after meals and more stable glucose levels throughout the day.

# 3. Supporting Insulin Production:​

Certain ingredients in Gluco6, such as Bitter Melon, stimulate insulin production from the pancreas. This can be especially beneficial for individuals whose insulin production has decreased over time due to poor dietary habits or underlying health conditions.

# 4. Reducing Inflammation and Oxidative Stress:​

Chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are often linked to insulin resistance and high blood sugar. Ingredients like Alpha Lipoic Acid and Berberine help reduce inflammation and oxidative damage, further promoting better blood sugar control.

Student loans are a major financial burden for many Americans. In the United States, a whopping $1.7 trillion is owed collectively in student loan debt according to the Education Data Initiative. 

That's a lot of people sharing your shoes! But no need to feel overwhelmed by all the talk of loans, interest rates, and repayment plans! 

When Penny Calling Penny is always ready to help you in your financial journey. Forget dry textbooks and confusing jargon! This guide is your BFF, which will help you navigate the world of student loans and also help you on how to repay student loans.

We'll break down the different types of student loans, figuring out which tools to use in your toolbox.

Plus, we'll make sense of interest rates - no more mystery behind those numbers! Consider this your cheat sheet to conquer [student loan](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/what-is-a-student-loan/) confusion.

But first let’s understand the types of student loans there are.

# Understanding Your Loans: Federal v/s Private 

College can be expensive, and student loans can feel like a whole new language. But hey, you're not alone!  Millions of us have been there, staring at loan options and wondering which one to pick. But fear not, future scholar! 

This section will equip you with the knowledge to [choose the right student loan](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-choose-a-student-loan/) for your educational journey. 

Here's the breakdown on the two main types of student loans:-

# Federal Loans

These government-backed loans offer lower interest rates and borrower-friendly benefits like income-based repayment plans. They come in different types based on your financial need. 

(a) Subsidized loans are like the helping hand of a friend - the government pays the interest while you're in school (high five!).  

(b) Unsubsidized loans are more like going solo - you're responsible for the interest from the start, but you might qualify for a higher borrowing limit. 

Roughly 43.2 million people in the US currently hold federal student loan debt, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

# Private Loans

Private loans, issued by banks and other lenders, can sometimes offer lower borrowing limits but may come with higher interest rates than federal loans. On average, private loan rates can be 1-3 percentage points higher than federal loans according to CNBC. 

They can be a good option for students with specific needs, like those in certain medical programs, but it's crucial to compare rates and terms before committing. It's always best to shop around to find the best deal! 

Before diving headfirst into loans, let's tackle two key concepts: interest rates and repayment periods.

# The Interest Factor: How It Affects Your Repayment

Interest rates can sound scary, but they're really just the fee you pay for borrowing money over time. 

*Remember, the lower the interest rate, the less you'll pay on top of the amount you borrow.* It's kind of like renting an apartment - a higher interest rate means more ""rent"" each month.

Here's a fun fact: federal loan interest rates are typically fixed, so they won't change much.  

Private loan rates can be fixed or variable, and something to remember about interest is that it can actually grow over time! Imagine it like a snowball rolling downhill, getting bigger and bigger. That's why it's important to choose a loan with a good interest rate to avoid owing a mountain of money in the future.

# Loan Repayment Periods

[Paying back your student loans](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-pay-off-student-loans/) takes time and planning, but don't worry, it's a marathon, not a sprint! These loans are typically repaid over several years, with the standard federal repayment plan stretching for 10 years. 

But there's good news! Many different repayment plans are available, depending on your income and financial situation. Some plans offer lower monthly payments but take longer to repay, while others focus on faster repayment with higher monthly payments. The most important thing is to find a plan that fits your budget comfortably. 

We'll dive deeper into different repayment plans later, but for now, remember: you have choices! 

**Pro Tip:** The most important takeaway is this: Knowledge is power! By understanding your loan options and repayment plans, you can take control of your student loan journey. 

We know you're eager to find the best repayment strategies, but before we dive in, let's take a crucial first step:

# Understanding Your Student Loan Situation 

The first step is to gain a comprehensive understanding of your current financial standing is to Calculating Your Total Debt First, Next up is Reviewing Loan Terms, Finally, Identify Payment Options. 

**OPTIONAL** 

Loan terms can feel like a foreign language, filled with technical jargon. Don't worry, we'll be your translator! Here are some key terms to pay close attention to:-

● **Interest Rate:** This is the fee you pay to borrow money over time. The lower the rate, the less you'll pay in total.

● **Repayment Period:** This is the time frame allotted to repay the loan in full. Standard plans typically last 10 years, but there are other options available, which we'll explore later.

● **Minimum Payment:** This is the minimum amount you're required to pay each month to stay current on your loan.

● **Repayment Plan:** This outlines the structure of your loan repayment, including the monthly payment amount and repayment period. 

Now that you have a solid grasp of your total debt and loan terms, it's time to explore your repayment options. 

There are various plans available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here's a quick overview:- 

● **Standard Repayment Plan:** This is the most common plan, offering a fixed monthly payment and a standard 10-year repayment period.

● **Income-Driven Repayment Plans:** These plans adjust your monthly payment based on your income and family size. This can be a great option if you have a lower income.

● **Graduated Repayment Plan:** This plan offers lower monthly payments initially, which gradually increase over time.

# How To Repay Student Loans Fast?

Here are few tips to clear off [student loan debt](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/how-to-get-student-loan-debt-forgiven/) faster:-

# Maximizing Income

Explore strategies to increase your income and dedicate more funds towards your debt repayment: 

**(i) Identifying Additional Income Streams:** 

While those loans might feel like a weight on your shoulders, there are ways to break free faster. Consider generating some extra income specifically for your student loans. Freelancing, online gigs, or part-time work are all great options. 

**(ii) Negotiating Salary or Hourly Rates:** Research industry standards for your position and consider negotiating for a higher salary or hourly rate. 

By gathering information about typical salaries for your role, location, and experience level (think years of experience, certifications, etc.), you arm yourself with the knowledge to negotiate effectively. 

Imagine you're a graphic designer with 3 years of experience in a major city. You find out the average salary range is $60,000-$75,000. 

Let's say the initial offer is $55,000. With your research as evidence, you can confidently approach the negotiation table and propose a salary closer to the market average, potentially securing an extra $5,000-$10,000 a year. 

That translates to a significant boost in your disposable income, allowing you to allocate more towards your student loans and accelerate your repayment journey.

**(iii) Utilizing Tax Refunds and Bonuses:** Tax refunds and bonuses can feel like a windfall, a happy surprise that lands in your lap. 

But instead of letting them disappear into everyday expenses, treat them like a financial treasure discovered specifically for your student loans!  

Imagine finding a hidden $1,000 bill in your pocket. Wouldn't you use it strategically?  

Allocate a significant portion of your tax refund or bonus directly towards your loan principal. This acts like a lump-sum payment that significantly reduces your outstanding balance. By reducing the principal amount, you end up paying less interest in the long run, saving you thousands of dollars over the life of your loan.

# Minimizing Expenses For More Resources

Focus on prudent spending habits to free up resources for debt reduction: 

**(i) Reducing Unnecessary Costs:** Analyze your budget and identify areas where you can cut back. Subscription services you never use or excessive dining out are potential targets for cost reduction. 

**(ii) Exploring Loan Forgiveness Programs:** Certain professions and public service careers offer loan forgiveness programs after a set number of years working in that field. Research your eligibility to determine if you qualify for such programs. 

**(iii) Refinancing or Consolidating Loans:** Refinancing or consolidating your loans can be a double-edged sword.  While it might secure a lower interest rate, potentially [saving you money](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/save-money-live-better/) in the long run, there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Before taking the plunge, carefully evaluate the options. 

Think of it like deciding on a new apartment – you wouldn't just pick the first one you see.

Research different lenders, compare interest rates, and understand the terms and conditions. 

If you have federal loans, consider that refinancing might mean losing valuable benefits like income-driven repayment plans. 

Consulting with a financial advisor can help you make an informed decision that best suits your situation.

*Part 2 of this guide will delve into prioritizing high-interest loans, utilizing windfalls wisely, maintaining consistency and motivation, and seeking professional advice.*

**Student Loan Repayment Strategies (Part 2)**

Building upon the foundation established in Part 1, this section delves into additional strategies for effective student loan repayment:

# Prioritizing High-Interest Loans: A Strategic Approach

High-interest loans accrue interest at a faster rate, significantly increasing your overall debt burden over time. Therefore, prioritizing these loans for repayment can save you a considerable amount of money.

**Understanding The Impact Of Interest**

Interest acts as a fee for borrowing money. The higher the interest rate, the more you pay on top of the original loan amount. Prioritizing high-interest loans minimizes the total interest accrued and reduces your overall debt burden.

**Strategies For High-Interest Loan Repayment**

There are two main approaches to tackling high-interest loans:- 

● **Avalanche Method:** This strategy focuses on directing the majority of your available funds towards the loan with the highest interest rate while maintaining minimum payments on other loans. [Avalanche method](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/avalanche-method-to-pay-off-debt/) minimizes the total interest paid over the entire repayment period.

● **Snowball Method:** This strategy prioritizes paying off the loan with the smallest balance first. While it may not save you the most money in interest, seeing loans disappear quickly can provide a sense of accomplishment and boost motivation. 

**Consider These Criteria While Choosing Your Method** 

Ultimately, the best method for you depends on your financial goals and personality:- 

**(i) Numbers-Oriented vs. Motivation-Focused:** If you prioritize saving the most money on interest and are comfortable with a long-term approach, the Avalanche Method might be a good fit. 

However, if seeing quick wins keeps you moving forward, the Snowball Method could be more effective. 

**(ii) Debt Tolerance:** Consider your current debt situation. If you have several high-interest loans with large balances, the Avalanche Method might feel overwhelming initially. The Snowball Method Is quicker wins can be a good motivator in such cases. 

**(iii) Financial Discipline:** Both methods require discipline, but the Avalanche Method demands slightly more. You need to be committed to allocating extra funds towards the high-interest loan even when the payoff might not seem immediate. 

**Remember:** There's no one-size-fits-all answer. The most important thing is to choose a method you can stick with consistently. Evaluate your financial situation, personality, and goals to determine which approach aligns best with your debt-free journey.

# Avoiding Loan Default

Missing loan payments is a slippery slope you don't want to slide down. The consequences are harsh: late fees that drain your wallet, a damaged credit score that haunts you for years, and even wage garnishment, where a portion of your paycheck is automatically deducted to repay the debt. 

Here's the key: prioritize making at least the minimum payments on all your loans, every single month. It might seem like a small step, but it's a giant leap towards staying afloat and avoiding default.

# Utilizing Windfalls Wisely

Life can surprise you with unexpected financial blessings – a tax refund, a work bonus, or maybe even an inheritance. These windfalls can be a game-changer in your debt repayment journey! 

Here's how to turn windfalls into a powerful weapon against your student loans:

**(i) Plan your attack:** Don't let these windfalls slip through your fingers! Develop a plan in advance for allocating a significant portion towards your student loan principal. 

Remember, the principal is the actual amount you borrowed, and reducing it lowers your overall debt burden. 

**(ii) Resist the urge to splurge:** It's tempting to treat yourself with a windfall, but remember, your long-term financial freedom is the ultimate prize. 

Avoid splurging on unnecessary items and stay focused on your debt repayment goals. 

**(iii) Direct hit on loans:** The most impactful way to use windfalls is to directly contribute them towards your loan principal.  This minimizes the amount of interest you accrue over time, saving you significant money in the long run. 

Think of it as chipping away at a large rock – the more you chip away at the principal, the smaller the rock (your debt) becomes, and the faster you reach the finish line (debt-free status!).

# Staying Consistent and Motivated

Look, student loans can feel like a long, uphill climb. But hey, nobody conquers a mountain in one go, right? 

Here are some tips to keep your debt-busting journey feeling fresh and keep you motivated: 

**(i) Celebrate Milestone:** Don't get lost in the big picture! Break down your repayment journey into smaller goals, like knocking out a specific loan or reaching a certain amount paid. Every milestone you hit deserves a mini-celebration! 

Think fancy coffee, a fun outing with friends, or whatever keeps you pumped. Yes get your Trenta Cold Brew, double shot, almond milk, caramel drizzle and enjoy!

**(ii) Ask for Support:** Nobody should fight this battle solo! Surround yourself with positive people who get your financial goals. These could be friends, family, whoever understands your hustle and cheers you on. Sharing your journey with them can keep you accountable and motivated, especially when things get tough.

**(iii) Don't Forget to Breathe:** It's easy to laser focus on debt repayment and forget about, well, life!  Make sure you schedule in time for activities you enjoy. Whether it's catching a movie, grabbing coffee with a buddy, or reading that book you've been meaning to, finding a healthy balance between tackling those loans and taking care of yourself is key to staying on track in the long run.

# Seeking Professional Advice

Consulting a financial advisor can be beneficial, especially when navigating complex financial decisions. 

**1. Consulting Financial Advisors:** Certified financial advisors can provide personalized strategies based on your unique financial situation.

They can help you evaluate different repayment options, explore loan consolidation or refinancing possibilities, and ensure your overall financial plan aligns with your long-term goals. 

**2. Understanding the Impact on Credit Scores:** Making consistent loan payments can positively impact your credit score. 

However, certain strategies like loan consolidation may have a temporary negative effect.  A financial advisor can help you understand the potential impact of different options on your [credit score](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/what-is-credit-score/). 

**3. Exploring Loan Forgiveness Options:** A [financial advisor](https://www.pennycallingpenny.com/what-is-a-financial-advisor/) can assist you in navigating various loan forgiveness programs and determine your eligibility. 

They can help you understand the requirements and ensure you are on track to achieve loan forgiveness if that is your ultimate goal.

# Common Mistakes To Avoid

The path to student loan freedom is paved with good intentions, but even the most well-meaning can stumble. Here are some common pitfalls to avoid:

**1. Neglecting Minimum Payments:** Missing payments can have severe consequences  - late fees, damaged credit scores, and even wage garnishment. Prioritize making at least the minimum payment on all your loans to avoid default.

**2. Late Payments:** Even a single late payment can negatively impact your credit score. Set up automatic payments or reminders to ensure on-time payments.

**3. Ignoring Income-Driven Repayment Options:** If your income is limited, IDR plans can offer significant relief. Explore your eligibility and consider switching to an IDR plan if it aligns with your financial situation.

**4. Ignoring Interest Accrual:** Remember, interest is like a snowball - it grows bigger the longer you wait. Prioritize repayment to minimize the total interest paid over time.

**5. Lifestyle Inflation:** Don't let your lifestyle expenses balloon as your income increases. Allocate any raises or additional income towards your loans for faster repayment.

# Resources For Further Information 

Knowledge is a powerful weapon in your debt-fighting arsenal. Here are some credible resources to equip you further:- 

**1. Federal Student Aid Website:** This website provides comprehensive information on federal student loans, repayment options, and loan forgiveness programs. 

**2. Your Loan Servicer's Website:** Each loan servicer has a website where you can access your loan information, manage your account, and explore repayment options. 

**3. Financial Aid Office:** Your college or university's financial aid office can offer personalized guidance and answer questions specific to your loan situation. 

**4. Non-Profit Credit Counseling Agencies:** These organizations provide free or low-cost financial counseling and education. They can help you develop a personalized debt repayment plan and manage your student loans effectively.

I was moving, squashed against something warm.

Something... no, *someone*... writhing.

It took me a disorienting moment to realize I was in the trunk of someone's car. 

I wasn't alone. 

I could feel his ice-cold breath on my face, and when I dared open my eyes, I saw the eerie sliver of a crescent moon reflected in his iris. 

So bright, and yet so beautiful.

Rowan wasn't completely *done* yet. 

There were still pieces of him that were contorted, confusing static struggling to stitch his skin back together.

But he was awake, his half-lidded eyes piercing into me.

“Urgh. I fucking haaaate you.” 

His voice was a whispered slurry mumble, and I could sense the darkness seeping back into me, ready to tear me away once again. The two of us were pressed together, eye to eye, our arms bound behind our backs, so there was no way to avoid that uncomfortable conversation neither of us wanted to have. “You're drugged.” I whispered, testing out my new mouth. 

He responded with a spluttered laugh. 

“Ahhctually, for the first tiiiime in a while I am completely 100% soberrrr right now, so you're going to fuhhhcking *listen* to me.” 

Moving closer, I could hear his heavy breaths, his attempts at stifling a panic attack. 

Rowan Beck had suffered from them his whole life.  But I had to remind myself this wasn't him. 

Rowan’s voice broke apart, and for a moment, he blinked away that mesmerising light, and seemed maybe kind of human. 

“Nin.” He whispered. “I'm begging you.” His warm lips grazed my cheek. 

I don't think that was his choice, especially when the car we were in flew over a speed bump. “Please save them.”

Instead of speaking, I found myself running my hands through his hair.

Wait, wasn't I tied up? 

My head was spinning, two versions of Rowan swimming in front of me. 

“Do you remember that show when we were kids?” I was aware I was drawing out my words too much, but my tongue was swollen. “You know! The one with the, uhmmm…”

He laughed, and maybe it was him being not fully there, or maybe it was genuine. 

“Fuck *off*.” Rowan’s voice cracked into a snort. “I’m not a fish.”

I laughed too, the two of us suddenly in hysterics. 

Maybe we *were* drugged. 

I woke (for the second time) to *screaming.*

Both inside the room I was in, and further away. Faded, but still bleeding through the walls.

The cries closer to me, blowing my eardrums out, weren’t human.

It wasn’t just screaming. It was brutal. Animalistic. A banshee wail I felt in my brain and in my bones, numbing my body and freezing me in place as I woke from slumber. It took me a moment to gather my bearings, memories flooding back.

I was in the car with Rowan, and we…crashed. 

I remembered I’d died for the 28th time. I remembered Rowan’s body being copied right in front of me, static becoming flesh, and flesh becoming skin. The rest was a blur. I had a vague recollection of flashes, like my memories were being fast-forwarded. 

Once I knew I was fully real, that my body wasn’t made of static, I had tried to drag Rowan out of the road. 

Then a sharp pain hit the back of my head, the world spun around, and… darkness.

I came to expecting the hollow sensation and the hunger, but I just felt dizzy. 

I was lying face down on the floor in my bedroom back at the house in a fresh puddle of drool. I knew it was my room because I could smell the exotic plants I kept on my window, and the raspberry-scented perfume plugged into the outlet. 

Slowly, I sat up, resisting the urge to cover my ears to block out the cry. It was agonising, nothing I’d ever heard before. In the corner of my eye, I saw her, a shape bleeding into my vision. 

Somehow, I knew she was crying in pain. 

It was agony and fear and anger enveloped in one hysterical cry, burning her lungs out and setting her body on fire. 

Imogen. 

I could feel my housemate’s scream like a living entity crawling inside my brain. 

Like she was dying.

And somehow, I could feel it. 

The entity slicing into my soupy brain and twining itself around my spinal cord.

Like Rowan, she was sickly pale and gaunt, but somehow beautiful. 

Lying in a pool of halo-colored hair and moonlit eyes, my housemate writhed like she was possessed. 

But she didn’t look like a monster. She was in pain, each wail wracking her body.

She was like an animal, I thought. An animal who needed to be put down. An animal I couldn’t stand to see like that. 

Her vacant eyes didn’t fully find me until I shook her, and life began to return to her expression slowly before she sat up. Imogen was trembling, her eyes raw, filled with tears, and not quite human, but I could believe for a moment, if I suspended my disbelief, that she wasn’t a monster. 

My housemate stared at me, blinking rapidly, like I was a hallucination, before her hand whipped out, claw-like fingernails slicing into my flesh.

I felt her desperation, each nail digging into my skin and drawing blood. 

She could smell me. 

Rowan said that the three of them had been starving for the last few days and seeing me must have been agony.

Before she seemingly caught hold of herself, Imogen’s grip loosened, her clammy fingers detaching from my flesh.

My housemate’s expression crumpled, humanity blooming back into fruition. Her voice grew stronger. “Please!” 

She was growing progressively more hysterical. “You have to stop them! They’re hurting them!” 

Imogen tried to get up, but she was so weak. I found myself reaching out a hand and yanking her to unsteady feet, and once she could hold herself, my housemate dragged herself over to the door. She needed to eat, I thought dizzily. But it’s not like the snacks I hid under my bed would do anything. 

I knew exactly what Imogen needed. 

Once I was close enough to the door, I could hear it: low murmurs, followed by yelling. And judging from Imogen’s expression, I knew we weren’t alone.

There were people downstairs. Strangers. 

Remembering the figure looming over me, the person who had knocked me out and brought me home, I shivered. Who would do that? I thought. They had kidnapped me, and presumably Rowan too, and brought us home? 

“Stop who?” I managed to get out.

My housemate was sobbing, trying and failing to get the door open, her twitching fingers scraping the handle. 

I sucked in a breath and grabbed her hands, squeezing them. 

The same thing I did in our freshman year, and I found holding her hands and talking to her in hushed whispers calmed her down enough to talk. 

This time, however, my housemate was inconsolable. I did what I could to break through. “Imogen.” I spoke stiffly. “You need to tell me what’s going on, okay?”

I squeezed her hands tighter, and her wails turned into soft whimpers. I hadn’t forgotten what she was, and who I was to her, nothing but food. 

But right then, we were both dealing with an unsuspected mutual enemy. 

I shook her again when she let out a sharp cry. Her whole body was trembling, and I fought to stabilize her. 

Every erratic movement threatened to buckle her legs. 

""Imogen. Who's downstairs?""

Her expression darkened, and I caught that sliver of moonlight glinting around her iris. 

Somehow, my housemate was acting territorial. 

“There are strangers,” she said through her teeth. “They’re hurting us, and I can’t stand it, Nin. They’re hurting us… they won’t stop hurting us, and my head… my head feels like it’s on fire. I can’t... think straight….” 

She drifted off, grabbing the door handle with one hand, and my arm with the other. I didn’t fight against her strength. I didn’t hear the rest of what she said; it was caught up in a territorial hiss ripping from her throat.

Imogen’s grip tightened once again as my housemate dragged me down the hallway. 

She flattened us against the wall and twisted to me, pressing a shaky finger to her lips. *Follow me*, her eyes told me. 

I held my breath, sticking to her steady stride. “The guys,” I managed to get out. “Did they…”

What was I going to say?

Did they hurt someone? 

Kaz and Rowan were unpredictable under the full moon. I had no idea what they were capable of.

It must have been them downstairs, them doing the hurting. After all, in my head, they were monsters.

“No.” Imogen whimpered. “It’s a group of them.” She said, “They’re hurting us!”

Imogen’s humanity practically emitted from her like an aura. I saw fear, pain, and anger. All human emotions.

“Kaz and Rowan,” she said in sharp gasps. “They killed them. Over and over again, they keep killing them! And it hurts!""

Copying, I thought dizzily.

Someone, no doubt the person who had kidnapped Rowan and me, was torturing them.

Imogen swallowed a cry, her expression twisting. 

She didn’t finish that sentence, and that only left more questions as she pulled me further down the stairs. 

The low murmur of voices got louder, until I could hear them clearly. 

A man, or a group of them. As we neared the door, Immie grew stiff. 

“Stay with me.” my housemate breathed. She turned to me, her eyes glowing, that eerie white bleeding into her irises. 

I couldn’t trust her, not when her expression had melted into something inhuman, something I’d expect from a horror movie. Her teeth came out in a vicious growl, her steel grip tightening.

The monster my housemate was, however, was surprisingly protective. 

When I tried to pull my arm from hers, Imogen made a hissing sound, digging her fingernails in. When I caught sight of the front door, I had a chance to run. 

I had a chance to rip my arm from her grasp, lunge into a sprint, and not look back. 

But I didn’t. 

When I jumped from the last step, the downstairs hallway was quiet.

The intruders were in the lounge. 

I could sense them, and I knew she could too; her nostrils flared like a wild animal as she followed their scent, moving in quick strides. 

I followed, not as quick as her, my body leaning back, trying to escape.

“It’s a full moon,” Immie said under her breath. “Kaz and I had just enough time to protect the house before they came.”

“What?” I whispered. I’d already checked, and totality wasn’t expected until September 10th. I’d checked multiple times to ensure I’d have enough time to escape before a full moon fell on us. 

But even as I thought that, my eyes found the clumsily taped-up front door, and if I squinted, I could just about glimpse the tiniest fragment of moon peeking in. 

“They broke in,” she said. “Those bastards broke in and took Kaz and then hunted down you and Rowan.”

As she spoke, my housemate pulled me towards the lounge, where I knew the 
kidnappers were. 

Immie stiffened up when she reached the door. 

I think part of her enjoyed searching each room beforehand, like she was hunting them down. She reminded me of a lioness losing her cubs. Whoever hurt Kaz and Rowan was dead, and we both knew that. 

I could tell from the way she moved, squeezing my arm like I was some kind of anchor.

We found the boys inside the lounge, surrounded by a group of strangers. 

I didn’t know what to look at first. 

The windows were taped up, blocking out the night bleeding in, a protection from the moon. 

Scattered around the room were various versions of my housemates, copies of them strewn across the floor. 

If it had been my first time, I might have thought I was seeing things, or even in a dream of my own making. 

There was so much blur between fiction and reality.

Inside that room at that moment, that line had been crossed multiple times.

What I was seeing reminded me of an Adult Swim commercial. 

I can’t remember which one, but I do know that those commercials were made to spread unease and play with that so-called line which separated reality and our own dreams.

The copies were in varying states: decapitated heads and severed limbs leaking static mixed with blood soaking into the carpet. It was like seeing a cartoon leak into real life. The canny, with the uncanny. My stomach twisted at the sight before my gaze found the current versions. 

Rowan and Kaz were strapped back to back, duct tape covering their mouths, feral teeth slicing through the gags. 

They looked like fresh copies, but I knew from experience the pain clung on, and memories were still fresh, even before they faded. I knew they were fucking strong. Rowan had pinned me to my seat with one hand, and Immie’s grip on me was cutting off my blood circulation. 

But somehow, the restraints pinning their wrists to the chair’s armrests were enough to hold them down. 

Kaz’s gaze met mine, his expression crumpling, like he was ashamed. 

He rapidly shook his head, gesturing for me to run. 

Rowan tipped his head back, snarling through his gag. His eyes were already half drowned in moonlight, already half taken over. The two of them were nowhere near moonlight, with it being trapped behind the taped-up windows. 

But I still saw it coming to life in their eyes, in their cracking skin splintering apart, static moonlight leaking out. 

It was strange seeing the hunters become the hunted. 

Imogen didn’t speak.

Her eyes were wide, her expression feral

When she made a move toward the boys, an oldish-looking man stepped in front of her, and I recognized him from Sam’s group of friends. He was one of the people who had surrounded Sam’s coffee table, marking something on a piece of paper, and actively trying to hide when Poppy dragged me in.

Now that I was taking in the others, I realized they were all from Sam’s house.

I recognized a dark-haired teenage boy and an older woman with greying hair and a thinning smile wielding a knife that I knew had already killed the boys multiple times. The leader's eyes ignited. “See?” 

He turned to the others. “I knew the little bitch would come try save her boys.”

He grabbed Kaz’s hair, yanking the boy’s head back. Kaz glared at me, like *I* was the problem, before averting his gaze.

He didn't fight back, squeezing his eyes shut.

Rowan shoved him, muffle screaming, but Kaz didn't move. 

“We’ve been playing with your friends for a while now,” The man’s grin made me nauseous. He was talking to Imogen. “Now you’re deciding to come downstairs?”

I watched the group take their positions, following orders. A familiar sandy-colored ponytail sent my heart into my throat. 

I must have been seeing things, right? 

Sure, I was seeing some of Sam’s friends, but I wasn’t seeing my best friend himself. 

That idea quickly splintered when I glimpsed his face. 

I wanted to find his expression frozen in some kind of trance. 

I wanted to believe he was brainwashed or under some kind of control. 

But Sam’s eyes were lit up with excitement, anticipation, his lips pulling into a small smile as his group surrounded Rowan and Kaz.

He must have seen me with Imogen, must have known that I was in the room. 

As much as I struggled to meet his gaze, however, I realized he was actively ignoring me. Sam was armed. 

The boy who told me he was scared of fireworks going off was armed with a scary-looking blade sticking from his belt, a handgun moulded into his palm. 

Imogen, trembling, stepped in front of me. Her lips curled back into a hiss, and the man’s eyes widened.

“See. She's a monster.” The man cocked his head, and I tore my gaze from Sam. “A devil too, I presume.”

Devils. My eyes took in the rest of them, their disgusted sneers. That’s what these people thought they were.

Imogen winced, hurt by their words, but she held herself together.

“They’re not devils.” I heard myself say, surprised by my confidence. 

I had spent days trying to escape the monsters in my house, the monsters who were killing and eating me. 

Yet, I was still a resident, and Sam and his gang were the intruders.

“Get out.” I said, directing my words at Sam. I was going to kill him.

Then I was going to kill his friends. 

“This has nothing to do with you.” I sucked my teeth. “Also, they're *clearly* werewolves.”

Rowan caught my eye, his expression crumpling. 

Even with the duct tape gag, his eyes perfectly screamed, “Are you *serious*?”

“No, Nin.” Imogen murmured. “I want to know who the *fuck* they think they are.”

Imogen’s gaze snapped to the man, her lips curling into a snarl. “Why are you hurting my family?”

Her grip slipped from my arm, and I was free. I was free to run, but I didn’t. 

Immie’s eyes reminded me of a cornered animal. She was frantic. 

“Who *are* you?” 

It was the first time I’d heard Imogen Prairie sound threatening. 

I’d known her for two years, and I’d never seen this side of her.

The monster she had been trying to hide.

She opened her mouth to speak but stopped when the teenage boy, who looked to be thirteen at most, lunged forward, grabbed Rowan by the scruff of his neck, yanked his head back, and plunged the knife he’d been playing with into my housemate’s stomach.

Rowan screamed, an agonizing raw wail piercing my brain. But his cry wasn’t alone. Kaz, struggling wildly, howled into his gag—and Imogen squeaked, slamming a hand over her mouth. 

And then it hit me. Why I’d woken to her crying, writhing on my bed. 

Why her tangled words had been barely decipherable on her tongue.

“Stop!” She screamed, dropping all pretense. 

Imogen could feel them. 

Everything they felt, everything the two of them were going through, she felt it too, and it was ripping her apart. 

Every copy of the boys who had been tortured and murdered, Imogen felt everything. Their pain. 

Their deaths. 

Their rebirths. 

Chuckling, the man pulled the knife out with a whistle.

It slid easily back through several layers of skin, though the knife was wet with static. Imagine something you didn’t think was tangible, didn’t think could be touched, and there it was, slicking the blade. There was a cavern in his gut, and already the blood was draining away, the skin stitching back together with pooling static. The man’s eyes were wide, lips stretched into a grin. 

“This is a fascinating magic trick,” he leered. “Why don’t you tell me, huh? How do these guys do it? We can slice up your boys and cut off their heads, and they just grow another one!”

His shriek of laughter pierced my ears, and I caught Rowan’s half-lidded eyes flick to the window still covered with tape.

Imogen's lip curled. She was already keeping an eye on him. Something told me the chair wasn't going to hold him for long.

“Rowan.” she spat. “I'm *handling* it.”

He responded with a snort, muffling through the tape.

“Well, you're doing a *great* fucking job!”

“I’ve got a question.” The kid stepped forward with a scowl. I expected Imogen to attack him, but she just stood there, paralyzed, her body rattling with the boy’s pain. 

“What did you devils do to my brother?” 

His words stirred something in my mind. 

Is that what they had been doing? Before me, had they feasted on others?

Others who didn’t share my ability to come back.

No. 

Because they made it pretty clear all they *could* eat was me. 

The leader, who was more in awe than disgusted, laughed. “You're devil spawn hiding in  an innocent’s body! Why don’t we have another look at what’s inside, hmm?” 

To my surprise, he gestured to Sam. 

“The Delacroix devil is an old flame, right? He’s all yours, Samuel. And don’t show any mercy, kid.”

In two quick steps, he was in front of Kaz, slapping him across the face. I saw Imogen’s expression darken significantly. Rowan snarled like an animal.

The man raised his voice, addressing the rest of them. “Just like I told you—this thing isn’t Charlie Delacroix. It’s a mimic. This creature wearing the boy’s handsome smile is nothing more than a suit of flesh for a devil, and we’re putting him down.” He laughed. “And we’ll do it again, and again, and a-fucking-gain—until he stays dead.”

Every word was emphasised as he ducked in front of Kaz, spitting each one in his face. 

Sam straightened up. He caught my eye before quickly looking away. 

“Yes, sir.”

“And remember,” the man grunted. “They aren’t human. I don’t know what the fuck they are. They're demons. They don’t even have shadows! Look at them! They bleed darkness, and they're feasting on townspeople!""

Sam didn’t move for a moment before nodding and striding over to my housemate.

Kaz weakly lifted his head, and I caught a glance between them. It was so fast I barely saw it, but it was definitely there. 

Familiarity and hatred mixed together in a cocktail burning between the two of them.

Sam didn’t hesitate, stabbing the blade through Kaz’s hand, and just like clockwork, Rowan and Imogen reacted in sync, jolting, like they had been electrocuted. Sam didn’t stop. 

He plunged the knife again and again, each thrust more violent, more brutal, telling a story. 

When Kaz’s body arched back, and he lunged forward in his chair, screaming through the tape over his mouth, howling like a beast, Sam twisted the blade deeper until it perforated bone, which turned to static, rewriting itself back into existence. 

Kaz’s body didn't make *sense*. 

Rowan’s cries turned animalistic as he kicked and screamed, his razor-sharp teeth slicing through the tape. 

Sam. 

No matter how much he seemed to enjoy it, there was something else in his eyes. 

Something I think he was in denial of, which only motivated him further. 

He was upset. No, angry.

Fuming.

My housemate’s pained wails were in perfect harmony, and next to me, Imogen took a different stance. 

Her grip slipped from my wrist. “Go upstairs and lock yourself in your room,” she said through sharp breaths. 

“Just like every other full moon, and don't come out until dawn.”

“What?” I managed. “Are you serious? I know what’s going on,” I swallowed. “And I want to help.”

“Help?” Imogen’s tone dripped with something sour. “So, not run away?”

“What?”

""Run."" She turned to me, her eyes pleading. ""Promise me you’ll lock yourself up. I don’t want you to see this.""

I was already backing away. “What are you going to do?""

Imogen was in agony. I could see it in her face, every contortion in her expression matching the boys’.

She offered me a sheepish smile. ""Just…talk to them.""

When I risked a look at Kaz, while Sam dragged a knife down his face, static pouring out, he was shaking his head. 

Don’t. His eyes were on Immie, desperate, as he struggled under the restraints. 

He seemed to already know what she was going to do. Imogen tried one more time. 

“If you want to talk, we’ll talk,” she said. “I’ll tell you everything about what we are. Just let them go.” Her lips pricked into a smile. “That’s your warning. Let them go, or I'll show you.""

“Show us?” the man scoffed. I inwardly cringed as he dragged his nails down Rowan’s face. Rowan snapped at him like a wild animal. “You’re already showing us! You’re inhuman! Be thankful we’re merciful enough to put you down right here—and not string you up on the gallows where you belong.”

“Then I’m sorry,” Immie said softly.

“Imogen.” Kaz muffled through his gag. I was getting déjà vu from the last full moon. 

He rocked forward in the chair, almost tipping over. ""You’re going to make it worse!""

""*Let* her do it!"" Rowan howled when an older woman with thinning white hair plunged her dagger into his arm. He was seething, a hysterical laugh bubbling. ""These bastards really think they can *kill* us?""

“Don’t do what?” the teenage boy joined in, a delirious grin on his face, circling my housemates like a shark. “You’re weak!”

Rowan spluttered. “I'm sorry, shouldn't you be playing Fortnite?”

“Imogen. Please.” Kaz chewed through his gag. “What the fuck is doing this going to accomplish?”

His gaze snapped to me, and I saw it. Disgust. Disdain he was trying to hide. 

“Tell her, Nin.”

“We just want to talk,” Imogen spoke through a growl. Her patience was thinning. “Let them go, and like I said, we’ll talk.”

But that just got a laugh from the group in response. Sam, the only one who wasn’t laughing, paused mutilating Kaz’s face. 

I noticed he was slower with the knife, like he was reveling in watching the skin slice open and splinter, bleeding moonlight.

“Talk?!” a woman screeched. Her voice was like nails on a chalkboard. “The devils want to talk to us?! Devilish wolves don't talk!”

Rowan groaned. “Jesus fucking Christ, we're not wolves!”

She pointed a gun at Imogen. “Tell me, child,” she sneered. “Would you be able to come back from a bullet in the brain? If I blow your head off, will you grow another one like them? Should I test it out? How about severing each of your limbs, hm?”

I saw the exact moment Imogen Prairie gave up. She gave up begging, gave up trying to negotiate. 

Gave up being human.

She grasped my hand, entangling her fingers with mine. 

I would be lying if I said it wasn't comforting. 

“There’s a freezer inside Rowan’s closet,” Immie said under her breath. “I want you to ignore what’s in it and lock yourself in there.”

“But—” I choked on my response, and she hissed, cutting me off.

“Now!”

I found myself nodding, my brain subconsciously submitting to that light in her eyes that was so hard to look away from. 

“Right.”

I staggered into the wall. 

Immie was next to me one moment, and then she was at the window, half of her face already illuminated in a semi-circle of moonlight. 

At first, I thought she was going to try another tactic to free the boys, maybe from the back. She was fast, after all. Faster than I thought. But… no. 

Kaz turned to me with questioning eyes before twisting to Immie, muffling into the tape over his mouth.

“Imogen, don't!”

Immie didn’t waste time, standing on her tip-toes and clawing at the protection put in place to block out the full moon. And almost as if the moon herself had been waiting in anticipation outside, fighting to get in, she seeped into the room, milky white light filling every corner and hitting every surface. 

I remember turning to run.

Though something made me turn, something, maybe morbid curiosity, twisted my body around and forced me to watch. 

Watch as I finally realized why my friends were so afraid of the full moon. 

Why they forced me to stay in my room every night and blast music until my ears were ringing. 

It was almost like they were waiting for it. 

At least, Rowan was. I knew part of him didn’t care about the control she had over him or what she made him do.

He just wanted out of that fucking chair. 

I watched his frenzied gaze fix on Sam, who was carving the flesh from my housemate’s face, before his twitching eyes darted to every corner the light bounced from. And then he went slack.

His wrists writhed against the restraints—then his face did the same.

It drooped to one side.

His whole expression went blank.

Kaz followed, at first trying to bury his head in his lap, but it was too bright, too powerful, drowning him, flooding his eyes.

Their faces, drenched in her, were... hypnotizing.

Just like the night of Abigail Matheson’s party. They stopped struggling, their frightened eyes wide, lips twisted around the gags—before going slack.

With her so close, inside the room, she filled me too.

I heard her voice, her melodic singing filling their minds.

No. Our minds. 

She was affecting me too. 

I was aware I was moving—jerking, twitching—trying to find a way out.

But I couldn’t move. She was in my head, twining herself around my being. Filling me. Teasing me. My housemates' eyes reflected the same eerie glow.

Not just the subtle halo glint I was used to seeing.

This was blinding light—light that should have scorched their eyes out. And yet it didn’t. Instead, it became part of them, weaving inside of them, fully taking over. 

She hit every reflective surface like she was burrowing deeper, overwhelming us. 

I was staring at Rowan, my gaze glued to him, that light bleeding from him was almost beautiful–hypnotising. 

I felt it beckoning me forward, and only snapped out of it when cutting fangs pierced through his ductape gag, his mouth parting in a monstrous snarl,  inhuman screech sending me to my knees. 

While the moon found her home, leeching onto their minds, I heard only the low hum of her song bleeding into my skull, enrapturing me.

The humans reacted differently. They seemed more confused.

I watched Sam’s expression shift from morbid pleasure to horror as he pulled back with the knife, but my brain couldn’t process what was happening.

Time seemed to slow down, and suddenly, there was so much screaming.

What my mind failed to grasp was that Rowan had ripped himself from the restraints, stumbling like an animal, duct tape still hanging from the corner of his mouth, and pounced on the woman who had leered at him. There wasn’t even a struggle.

I saw those brand new teeth snap out in an animalistic bite—and her headless torso hit the ground. Just like that.

So fast.

But he didn’t stop there.

Once free and fully exposed to her light, still suffocating the room, my housemate dropped to his knees, tearing into her chest and ripping out squirming, glistening insides until she was nothing more than unrecognizable flesh pulsing under his weight.

I didn’t even see Kaz escape, but his chair was overturned, and there was so much… blood. So much red illuminated under the mesmerizing moonlight, drenching everything.

It glittered under dim light, entrails and severed limbs strewn across the carpet.

Kaz had been the chilled out one, the one against killing Sam and his gang.

But once the moon seeped inside him, my usually laid-back housemate crawled across the floor, tearing into anything resembling human flesh, bounding forwards on his hands and knees like a rabid dog. 

I watched him dive on the flailing teenage boy, gnawing into him.

Mushy pink matter clung between his teeth as he chewed through the boy’s skull, newly elongated fangs splintering shattered bone and brain.

Kaz’s movements were mindless, blindly grasping for anything alive in his path.

Imogen pounced on a screaming man, ripping out his spine with a single, brutal tug.

Then Rowan—still kneeling over the woman’s remains—coughed up an eyeball. Imogen snatched it from the ground and stuffed it into her mouth, the pulpy mass of red and white squelching between her too-sharp teeth.

That’s when I remembered how to breathe.

Movement behind me. Sam’s sharp, heavy breaths hit the back of my neck as he whispered, “Run.”

“Get out of here, Nin,” he hissed, slipping on entrails stuck to the soles of his shoes.

“Fucking run!”

Kaz, still ravaging the corpse of the leader, reacted to Sam’s movement. His neck snapped up, head cocking to the side. 

His eyes were vacant.

Sam stumbled back. He didn't look scared. I wouldn't say it was fear. It was pain. Agony. 

""Fuck."" He said in a sharp breath, his gaze on Kaz. Sam pressed himself against the wall, twisting his head to find an exit. 

""Kaz.”  He held out his hands. “Hey! Kaz, it's me!” 

My housemate’s face was transformed. No longer human, no longer the guy I knew, twisted into something resembling a zombie. 

His eyes were milky white, filled, drenched, overwhelmed with her. 

Every part of him was her, his splintered skin bleeding her, his claws digging into flesh and bone. There was nothing there. 

No ignition in his eyes, nothing to suggest he was a living, breathing human. 

Looking at Rowan, he had the same look, kneeling over the kid’s body, his hands cupping into the cavity in the gut and scooping out glistening gore. 

Imogen, moving from each body with incredible speed, like an animal, her toes primed, slick with pooling red. 

I was still standing there, staring, like a fucking idiot, when the three of them seemed to… change. 

No, that’s not the word. 

As if they operated as a three, they all suddenly got the same thought. 

Kaz stopped mindlessly chewing, a slew of chewed up red mush slipping down his chin. 

Rowan spat out the severed arm he’d been mauling, and Imogen lifted her head, and looked directly at me. 

The other two followed, like they shared a hivemind of some kind, a mind which no longer thought like a human, instead like a feral beast. I would much rather have been ignorant at that moment. I would have happily worn rose tinted glasses. 

Instead though, it began to dawn on me. Looking at what they were feeding on, they weren’t really eating it. Just chewing and spitting it out, or in Rowan’s case, mauling on it like a dog. 

When Imogen slowly got up on primed toes, nostrils flaring, moonlit eyes pinpointing on me, I remembered her words before she surrendered to the moon. *Go upstairs and lock yourself up.* 

And as the three of them began to slowly make their way towards me, like animals cornering prey, I found my gaze going to their so-called meals. None of which they had eaten. Another step. 

They were taking their time, revelling in my scent, moving as a group. 

I could sense their mutual agreement that they were going to share. 

When Rowan made a sound cross between a snarl and a snort, I twisted around and ran. The front door was close, but they already knew my thoughts before I did. They knew my destination before it was in my head. Kaz appeared in front of the door, Rowan and Imogen behind him. 

So, I dived upstairs. 

Again, though, they already knew.

They knew where I was heading. 

Their footsteps followed me, pounding up the stairs, forcing me to kick myself further into a frenzied sprint. 

Their breath tickled the back of my neck, and halfway up the stairs, a hand curled around my leg and yanked. 

I crumpled, losing my grip on the top stair, flailing, and kicking my attacker in the face. 

Kaz.

Faster than the others, a mindless determination glimmered in his eyes, he didn’t stop, didn’t falter, only falling, and getting back up again, crawling up the stairs on all fours. 

As if watching him, the moon seemed to follow, her light pouring from cracks in his face. His arms wrapped around my waist and pulled me halfway down the stairs, and I kicked blindly, only for his grip to loosen, letting me go.

Reaching the top, I followed Immie’s earlier words and threw myself into Rowan’s room, slamming the door behind me and throwing my weight into it. 

But they were already on the other side, hurling themselves into old wood. Fuck. 

Scanning my housemate’s room, I glimpsed his closet. 

They were going to get through. 

Their combined weight was overwhelming, sending me staggering. 

I left the door, lunging into the closet just as they broke through. 

Rowan was first, then Kaz and Imogen. 

When I saw Rowan’s teeth curl back, an animalistic hiss ripping into my ears. 

Rowan dropped onto his knees, rolling around in seeping, pooling moonlight. 

I made awkward eye contact with him, and his head inclined. 

He made a soft noise, and I bit back a hysterical laugh. 

*Yep. Definitely werewolves.*

The closet door was flimsy, barely even a door. 

But something was inside: a large white container my brain didn’t register as a freezer until I yanked it open, finding myself face-to-face with severed pieces of an earlier version of me. 

I didn’t have time to be disgusted. 

Slamming the closet doors shut, or at least trying to shut them as best as I could, I climbed into the freezer, burying myself in my own body parts, and closing the lid shut. 

Sucking in a breath, I waited for them to knock it over, or rip open the lid. Instead though, the three of them didn’t even come in the closet. They knew I was in there. I could hear them clawing at the wood, slamming their weight into it. 

But for some reason they never came in. When I was sure I was safe, I risked letting out a breath. 

And then I was too aware of where I was. What I was enveloped in. I reached out, cringing when I touched my own severed flesh. 

Rowan had cut me into pieces. Probably so I’d last longer. 

My stomach flipped over, and my mouth watered. I was going to throw up. I could feel it, a barf-like paste creeping up my throat. The closet door suddenly flew open, footsteps following. They were in. 

So close. I could hear their heavy pants. Instinctively, my fingers curled around what felt like a slimy piece my torso before something flashed in front of my eyes. A memory from that version of me.

The version they’d murdered and cut up, preserving me in Rowan’s freezer.

This had happened before, I thought dizzily. I’d seen my body’s memories in a sharp blur of colors I could barely focus on.

But this.. this was in clarity. 

Again, I saw everything through her eyes. Unlike the other memory, it was less like I was seeing it, more like I was reliving it. 

The graze of cool night air on my bare skin as I opened up our door to a figure on our doorstep.

*“Oh, hey!”* My own voice was a lot lighter and more energetic. I barely recognised myself. *“You’re…not the pizza guy.”*

“Nin!” Kaz yelled from upstairs. “Did they send extra? My wallet is in my car!”

“Tip them if they're hot!” Imogen shouted, her voice a very drunk slur. 

“It’s not the pizza guy!” I shouted back through a laugh.

It struck me, then, that I didn’t remember this.

This had been part of my blackouts. 

What had been ripped from my memories. 

I felt myself pull away from my body parts, my gut curling at the thought of finally knowing what happened that night. I had to know. 

Even when part of me cringed away, refusing to accept a certain part of myself, I needed to understand the events. 

So, ignoring my body’s insistence to let go, I dug my nails into my own severed flesh, willing myself to delve back into the memory when it started to blur out of focus.  A woman. She was maybe in her late fifties or early sixties with white hair growing grey at the ends. 

Her smile was friendly, and I instantly trusted it.

“Good evening! Would you mind helping me out?” 

I felt the dread building in my current self, as well as in my memory. 

In my memory, however, I ignored the alarm bells.

“Bolivia House, I presume.” The old woman’s smile widened, “It’s just like I remember it.”

Her eyes flicked from the door to me. “I am quite lost.”

“Yeah, of course!” I said, my voice sounded different. Tipsy. I think we were all drunk. “What do you need help with?”

Before the woman could answer, a voice spoke up, and I twisted around. Rowan was standing behind me, halfway through a bag of Cheetos. “Who’s at the door?” He said, through a mouthful of orange mush. 

“Nin, I said don’t talk to strangers.”

Rowan. Part of me splintered. I forgot what he looked like before my blackouts. 

Before he started wearing raybans to hide the effects. 

His eyes used to be warm. Friendly. 

They used to be pretty to look at, a deep shade of brown with flecks of ember like orange. Now I could barely see them anymore. 

They’re almost completely taken over whether he’s possessed or not.

I shoved him, shooting the woman an apologetic look. “It's literally an old woman.” I said through a gritted smile. “Do you want to come in?”

Rowan copied me, grinning through his teeth. “And *what* if she's a psycho murderer?”

The woman cleared her throat. She nodded to Rowan. “Do you and your girlfriend live alone?”

*”Girlfriend?!”* He squawked, choking on Cheeto dust, and I shoved him. Harder. 

Rowan hissed. “That hurt!”

“Go back upstairs. You're drunk and embarrassing yourself.”

“We’re housemates.” I corrected the woman. “There are two more of us!”

“Okay, but whyyyyy do you wanna know?” Rowan pressed his face against the door, attempting to act as *weird* as possible. 

I shoved him again and he fixed her with a not-quite smile, “Are you planning on moving in? We're not an AirB&B, y’know.”

“Goodness, no!” The woman said. “I was just curious! So, four of you, correct?”

Rowan folded his arms. “Why so many questions?” He stepped forward. “Can I question *you*?”

“Rowan.” I warned him. “I’m dealing with it."" 

The woman nodded along, seemingly grateful for me shutting him up. “Thank you.” She said, “Would I be able to come in?”",1,1728901695.0,Malliem,0,1.0,False

So it’s manic Monday.  Things always seem just a little more nutty than needed on Monday.  Kids don’t want to get up and ready.  Other parents are going nuts trying to get their kids to school.  Work folks are late or need more coffee or are grumpy.  Except Larry.  That jerk is always in a good mood.  

So in the spirit of Manic Monday, let’s discuss things that made you and your lost love crazy.  

My wife was the neatest neat freak at work.  Her space when she worked in an office was immaculate and later when she owned her flower shop, it was as clean as it could be.  She was organized, thorough and thoughtful with everything at work.  When she got home she was a nightmare.  Clothes, shoes, and papers everywhere with no rhyme or reason.  It was impossible to clean or organize.  When I was cleaning, I found birth certificates mixed with Walmart receipts together with report cards.  I found probably 20 notebooks with 1/3 full of notes.  Not in some sequential order, but with random pages filled with notes about random things.  To complete a set of notes on a subject one might need 3 or 4 notebooks.  

The bedroom was the worst.  After she passed, I immediately cleaned our bedroom, bathroom and closet.  I took out two 55 gallon trash sacks of expired medicine, papers, and assorted garbage.  I haven’t touched her clothing or make up.  

It drove me nuts.  Kids have learned to be total slobs from her.  It’s probably my biggest fight with the kids and I struggle with it daily.  ",9,1728901518.0,widowers,2,0.92,False

Round tables are perfect if you have a smaller or more compact living room. The curved edges allow for better movement around the table, giving the space a more open feel for your family. Since it lacks sharp corners, a round table like this ‘[Royaloak Novara Italian Glass Coffee Table](https://www.royaloakindia.com/royaloak-novara-glass-coffee-table.html)’ fits neatly into tight spaces without feeling overcrowded. This makes it especially handy for homes with limited rooms or furniture close together.

# Rectangular Coffee Tables

Larger living rooms, on the other hand, often benefit from rectangular coffee tables. These tables stretch across more space, making them perfect for longer or more spacious rooms. A round table, because of its small size, can make larger rooms feel empty. If you have a long sofa or a sectional couch, a rectangular table like this ‘[Royaloak Sepang Malaysian Glass Coffee table](https://www.royaloakindia.com/royaloak-sepang-malaysian-glass-coffee-table.html)’ aligns well, filling the space efficiently and creating a balanced look. Rectangular tables can also perfectly work as a **centre table for living room.**



# 2. Safety and Practicality

For many families, especially those with young children or pets, safety is a big concern. Here’s how the two shapes differ in terms of practicality and safety:

# Round Coffee Tables

The absence of corners on round tables makes them much safer in households with small children or even pets. There’s no risk of bumping into sharp edges, making the room feel more child-friendly. Also, round tables tend to have a soft, flowing look, which can help create a relaxed, welcoming vibe in your living space.

# Rectangular Coffee Tables

While rectangular tables provide more surface area, they come with sharp corners, which can be a potential hazard in homes with kids or if you tend to walk around the furniture a lot. However, if your space is more formal, or you live in a home without young children, this may not be an issue for you. Recently, you can even find rectangular tables that don’t have sharp edges, rather, they are smartly rounded around the edges to protect from any injuries. This ‘[Royaloak Parma Italian 5D Marble Coffee Table](https://www.royaloakindia.com/royaloak-parma-italian-5d-marble-coffee-table.html)’ is a perfect example of a rectangular coffee table with rounded edges.



# 3. Style and Aesthetic

The shape of your [**coffee table for living room**](https://www.royaloakindia.com/living/center-table/glass-center-table.html) can also impact the overall aesthetic of your room. Different shapes work better with certain decor styles, so it’s essential to consider how the table will complement the rest of your furniture.

# Round Coffee Tables

These tables often lend themselves to more casual, contemporary, or even bohemian spaces. Their soft curves break up the straight lines of other furniture, adding a sense of fluidity and balance to the room. Round coffee tables work well with minimalist decor, as they naturally draw the eye without overwhelming the space.

# Rectangular Coffee Tables

Rectangular tables, on the other hand, are ideal for traditional or modern rooms. They offer a structured, clean-lined look that pairs beautifully with formal or industrial decor. If your room has a lot of angular furniture like square sofas or boxy chairs, a rectangular coffee table helps maintain that sharp, defined look.

# 4. Functionality and Storage Options

While design and safety are essential, it's important to not forget about the functionality of your coffee table. Coffee tables aren’t just for holding drinks; they’re also storage solutions, workspaces, and decorative platforms.

# Round Coffee Tables

Typically, round coffee tables don’t offer as much storage space as rectangular ones. However, some modern designs like ‘[Royaloak Monza Italian Marble Coffee Table](https://www.royaloakindia.com/royaloak-monza-italian-marble-coffee-table.html)’ include hidden storage or lower shelves, providing just enough room for magazines, remotes, or small decorative items. They are also ideal for informal spaces, where functionality takes a backseat to aesthetics.



# Rectangular Coffee Tables

Rectangular coffee tables often come with built-in storage options, such as drawers, shelves, or lift-tops, making them highly functional. This makes them great for homes where space is at a premium or if you need a surface that doubles up as a workspace or storage unit. You can easily tuck away books, games, or other clutter in the coffee table like this ‘[Royaloak Rovigo Italian Marble Coffee Table](https://www.royaloakindia.com/royaloak-rovigo-italian-marble-coffee-table.html)’ to keep the room looking neat.



# Conclusion

Both round and rectangular coffee tables have their own set of benefits, and what works best for your home depends on the space available, your lifestyle, and the overall look you're going for. Whether you choose a sleek, modern round table or a classic rectangular one, make sure it enhances your room's style and serves your functional needs. A well-chosen coffee table isn’t just a piece of furniture; it's the finishing touch that ties your room together.
