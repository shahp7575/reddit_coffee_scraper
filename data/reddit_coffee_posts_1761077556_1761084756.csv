1ocqnh1,https://i.redd.it/dl1ofaxggjwf1.jpeg,Your Opinion Isn’t a Free Pass to Disparage Soulidified!,"LONG READ! 🛑

I’m going to address this once and for all, and yes, I already know the downvotes will come, because I’m not exactly a favorite here. I tend to come off pretty strong when people choose to stay committed to tearing these guys down, but honestly, I’m exhausted. I’ve watched this same cycle play out for a while on here, and at this point, I couldn’t care less what anyone does with this post.

Let’s be clear: this isn’t directed at those who share genuine opinions or constructive criticism, the kind rooted in fair observation and respect. This is aimed at the members of this sub who have made it their mission to either periodically or constantly disparage Soulidified at the slightest opportunity. It’s disheartening, especially coming from people who clearly aren’t following their journey closely. 

It’s always something: “they’re not doing enough,” “Shade wants to be the main character,” “ false unity,” or “they won’t last.” etc…Some have even gone so far as to claim that they’re touring with 3Q just to “extend the band’s lifespan,” which is not only condescending but also a blatant disregard for the craft, talent, and dedication these men embody. We are talking about an ethnically diverse group who came together in a completely new setting and stuck together even as independent band with limited resources and somehow, that still isn’t enough. When are they ever going to be enough?

Recently, one particular thread pushed this over the edge. A few in those comments did spread outright misinformation, not opinions, but lies. There’s a difference. You’re absolutely entitled to think they might not last, but fabricating narratives and twisting facts crosses a line. You cannot keep making baseless claims about a band you barely follow and pretend it’s insight.

Soulidified has demonstrated unity on multiple levels,  posting together, supporting one another, creating covers, and sharing moments as a team. Any slowdown on social media has only been due to tour prep/ intense bootcamp hours (we’re talking 10-12hrs a day per the members). That’s not division; that’s work.

The narrative that they “only came back as a band after seeing fan support,” if there’s any truth to it, isn’t that literally the point? Isn’t music about connection, community, and opportunity, whether done as a band or solo? They’ve also said multiple times that part of their motivation is for Liam, yet that always gets conveniently ignored. None of the other contestants on BTB were in a band; they were all solo acts. Soulidified’s story has always been different, and it deserves acknowledgment, not ridicule.

Had they debuted outside the show, without a platform to establish themselves, their uphill battle would have been exponentially harder. They would have had to fight to be understood and accepted as a band  something that should come naturally given their group dynamics. Waiting until the show to gauge fan reception wasn’t hesitation; it was intentional and strategic. That decision was rooted in the fans, in seeking genuine belief in what they were building. That’s not weakness, that’s wisdom. It’s incredibly disheartening, and frankly condescending, to see that choice twisted against them. In reality, it strengthens the loyalty of those who truly understand their vision and respect the heart behind their journey.

Some of you go even further with the double standards, pointing to Siren Society as independent artists putting out more content and claiming that being independent is “no excuse,” yet they aren’t climbing the ladder either and barely get any engagement. Y’all have yet to address the real issue here! Soulidified, on the other hand, are independent artists building  their crafts as well, the only difference is that they might be taking the time to refine their vision let their fans connect with their story and their sound, since they couldn’t do so fully earlier due to obvious constraints, yet some interpret their approach as a lack of commitment or ambition simply because they aren’t constantly posting on social media like others. It’s always “create more content, do this, do that,” without acknowledging the many factors at play or the unique circumstances of being an independent band in bootcamp & preparing for a tour.

And yes, the MTM comparisons are unavoidable for some, whether consciously or not. But MTM were always positioned to be a band, thanks to Mason’s label support immediately after the show and a strong team, a level of leverage and resources Soulidified simply doesn’t have at this time. It took MTM a year to reach their current standing, yet some expect another independent band to replicate that trajectory in 3 months??Make it make sense, even if that isn’t the stated reasoning, that’s how it reads. The truth is, none of us truly knows what’s happening behind the scenes, so forming opinions based solely on external perception is not only unfair, it’s misleading.

This sub is becoming increasingly toxic and favors one band over another, no faults of the mods because they’ve been incredibly supportive of every band!. However, the way some of you continue to look down on these guys simply because they don’t have the same level of resources or meeting up to your “standards” is wrong! plain and simple. Mods need to take a serious look at this, because this has gone far beyond opinions. What’s happening here is targeted, misleading, and falsehood!

If you’re a Souldier like myself or someone who appreciates them as a group reading this, never doubt that these boys are committed to their careers and their future as a band. If there’s anything you feel they could improve, trust that they will grow into it. Like any band, there will be challenges and tension, that’s part of the process, especially for independent artists. But I believe in their growth. And if, for any reason, this chapter doesn’t go perfectly or it all comes to a halt, I hope they give it their absolute best shot!

Finally, to whom it may concern, stop with the comparisons, stop with the false narratives, and let them build their path. They’ve earned that chance! ",1,1761084528.0,BuildingTheBandSeries,0,1.0,False

1ocqmjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/gumball/comments/1ocqmjc/eww_the_wicked/,EWW: The Wicked,"Hello and welcome to episode 134 in a series inspired by [u/kamikazeb0y](https://www.reddit.com/user/kamikazeb0y/) and CinemaSins, where I'll be sinning each and every episode of Gumball!

Quick Disclaimer: I know this is just a children's cartoon and isn't meant to be taken seriously. This, like the show itself, is not at all meant to be taken seriously or considered an actual critique of the show. It is all in good fun.

With that out of the way I present you, Everything Wrong With: The Wicked!

  
*\[It is afternoon in the park. Margaret Robinson kneels in the grass with a bag of nuts, holding one out for the squirrels\]*  
**Margaret**: Meh meh. Meh meh meh meh! *\[Shakes the bag\]* Meh! *\[Tosses the nut and takes another from the bag\]*  
*\[Her nuts happen to catch the attention of Gumball and Darwin, who scamper up to her like squirrels themselves. Before they can get a taste, though, Mrs. Robinson jerks her hand away\]*  
**The fucl? Why are the two of them going around acting like squirrels in the park? I mean this is weird, even for them +1**

**Darwin**: I didn't know you liked squirrels, Mrs. Robinson... or the outdoors... or daylight.  
**You know, he has a fair point. I didn't realise until now, but we pretty much never see Margaret outside of her house or garden. Nice to see the writers actually doing something with her for once +1** 

**Gumball**: Ow*\[The squirrels become aggressive and Gumball backs away from them with a scream. The frightened brothers are backed up to a nearby tree by the crazed squirrels\]*  
**Darwin**: *\[Sniffs the nut he holds\]* Dude, those nuts are coated in coffee  
***Damn,*** **this bitch is a psycho! I mean, how does someone even think of an idea like ""feeding squirells coffee coated nuts to make them go insane""?! +1**

**Donut Cop**: Who is responsible for this?!  
**Margaret**: *\[Points at Gumball and Darwin\]* Meh!  
**Gumball** and **Darwin**: *\[Look at her and gasp\]*  
*\[That evening, Gumball and Darwin, dressed in orange jumpsuits, are picking up roadside litter\]*  
**Wait what? You aren't even going to attempt to explain what really happened or defend yourselves? +1**

**Darwin**: Yeah, soaking those nuts in prune juice was overkill.  
**Gumball**: No, I meant I can't believe Mrs. Robinson could be that evil.  
**Dude, you've known her for 12 years. How have you** ***not*** **come to the conclusion that she's pure evil incarnate after that long? +1**

**Gumball**: Jump.  
**Darwin**: What? *\[The light behind him grows more intense\]*  
**Gumball**: JUMP!  
*\[Gumball tackles Darwin out of the way before the car can hit him\]*  
*\[They watch in horror as the cackling Margaret drives her car recklessly down the sidewalk, knocking over a mailbox. She drives into the street to purposefully graze two cars parked on the roadside and drives on\]*  
***What the fuck!?*** **Did she** ***seriously*** **just try to** ***kill*** **a 10 year old!? I get she's pure evil, but is she really that batshit insane to attempt murder in** ***broad fucking*** ***daylight!?  +10***

**Gumball**: That looks pretty evil to me.  
**Darwin**: No, nobody can be completely evil.  
**Oh you naieve, innocent little child. Wait until the real world hits you dude.** ***Most*** **people are pure evil. +5**

*\[Margaret throws the door open, slamming it into Gary's face and leaving his motionless arm stuck through the slot\]*  
*\[A whimsical song starts playing with a singer backing it up\]*  
**Singer**: *Pain and regret and frustration and sadness. Misery, turmoil, and anger and madness.*  
*\[Margaret happily skips out to the sidewalk and lets a butterfly land on her hand, only to blow it into a spider-web. A spider descends to devour it\]*  
**Singer**: *The smell of the garbage, the taste of despair.*  
*\[Margaret dances down the sidewalk and kicks over her neighbors' garbage bins\]*  
**Singer**: *These simple things leave me walking on air.*  
*\[Margaret happily smells the rancid, fly-ridden garbage before dancing away\]*  
*\[Margaret skips into a nearby yard where Mr. Small stands watering his plants with a hose. As he is unaware of her presence, she successfully snatches his hedge trimmers from his tool belt and cuts off the three giant flowers standing behind him. She tosses the trimmers back into his tool belt and frolics away just as Mr. Small turns to stare in shock at his beheaded flowers\]*  
**Singer**: *Toothache and heartburn and bad halitosis.*  
*\[Mrs. Robinson opens someone's mailbox\]*  
**Singer**: *Hay-fever, bunions, and deep-vein thrombosis.*  
*\[Margaret pulls out all the letters inside and gleefully tosses them in the air like confetti, leaving them scattered about on the ground\]*  
**Singer**: *A trip to the dentist: the sound of the drill.*  
*\[At a local building, Principal Brown steps out of his car and goes to attend to business. As Hank, standing nearby, washes a window with a squeegee, Margaret tap-dances up to the building\]*  
**Singer**: *These are things that will give me a thrill!*  
*\[With a spin, Margaret grabs up Hank's bucket and blissfully tosses the dirty water onto Principal Brown's car. She drops the bucket and dances away just as Principal Brown returns from his business\]*  
**Singer**: *When the milk spills. When your dog's ill. When all hope takes flight.*  
*\[Principal Brown is shocked to see dirty water splashed on his car and assumes Hank responsible. Angered, he tackles Hank\]*  
**Singer**: *When everyone else feels incredibly sad...*  
*\[Goblin has just taken money from an ATM. As he puts it in his wallet, Margaret comes up to him. She takes his hands and merrily dances with him for a moment, snatching his wallet while he is distracted. Only after Margaret has left does Goblin notice his wallet is missing. As the confused Goblin searches for it on his person, Margaret dances past Gumball and Darwin, who stare at her, shocked by her deeds\]*  
**Singer**: *...my world fills with pure delight.*  
*\[With a can of spray paint, Mrs. Robinson changes the number on a speed limit sign from ""30"" to ""800"". Standing next to her is Billy, happily licking an ice cream cone. He and Mrs. Robinson watch two cars collide. Billy observes it with horror and Margaret with satisfaction. As Billy stares, Margaret slaps the ice cream cone out of his hand and onto the ground. Margaret leaves, but when Billy sheds a tear, she returns and catches it in a glass. She drinks it and is satisfied. As she leaves, she throws away the glass, which shatters on Billy's head\]*  
**Singer**: *When you slip up. When you trip up. When you stub your toe.*  
*\[Marvin locks his car, but drops his keys. He reaches down to grab them, but pulls his back and drops his cane\]*  
*\[Margaret skips up to Marvin and picks up his keys, but just as he reaches for them, she tosses them into his car through his barely-opened driver side window. He glares at her as she dances away\]*  
**Singer**: *I point and I cackle, I clap and I laugh, and happiness starts*  
**Marvin**: Why you!  
*\[Marvin sticks his arm through the window, but his arm is too short. Margaret returns, and since the car rests precariously at the top of a steep slope, she nudges it with her hip\]*  
**Singer**: *...to FLOOOOOWWWWWW!*  
*\[With his arm stuck in the window, Marvin is pulled along by his car as it rolls rapidly down the slope. Gumball and Darwin watch in horror. Then, Margaret hops across a row of cars, caving their roofs in, shattering their windows, popping open their hoods, and setting off their alarms\]*  
**Firstly, hearing Margaret speaking English is cursed as fuck +5**

**Secondly, I don't understand how** ***anyone*** **can find pleasure in other people's misery. Like, how can you** ***possibiy*** **find that enjoyable in any way? I don't get it +1**

**Darwin**: Surely, you were once like that: innocent and pure.  
**Gumball**: *\[Reading the tag on Margaret's wig\]* Nope. It says here she's seventy percent cotton, thirty percent polyester, and made in...the fiery pits of the underworld.  
**This...has a lot of implications. Is Margaret literally the devil come to the real world? Is she the result of some kind of ritual or spell to create the most evil being in the universe? You've just opened up a huge can of worms, fan theories and fanfiction ideas +5**

**Darwin**: Did you just swap their name tags?!  
*\[Margaret leaves the room and returns to the boys\]*  
*\[The mothers and fathers of the two babies come into the room. Each father takes a moment to notice that the child in his arms looks like the offspring of the other set of parents. Assuming the worst, the two fathers begin to fight. All the infants cry as the fathers battle it out, and Mrs. Robinson watches from outside, chuckling wickedly\]*  
**So, instead of assuming the logical thing of the name tags accidentally being swapped, they instead jump to the conclusion that their wives cheated on them with the other? If this is your first thought upon seeing something like this, then your partner needs to take a step back and question just how little you really trust them. +5**

**Darwin**: How can you enjoy this?! You're messing with people's lives  
**Darwin would be good at CinemaSins +1**

**Gumball**: Oh, hi, Mr. Robinson! We're here to-uh...offer you a free house-cleaning service!  
**Gaylord**: *\[Suspiciously\]* *Why?*  
**Darwin**: Uh...to raise...money for our school.  
**Gaylord**: *\[Suspiciously\]* You're cleaning my house for free in order to raise money?  
**And so would Mr. Robinson +1**

**Gaylord**: On one hand, I don't trust you. On the other hand, I DON'T TRUST YOU!  
**Gumball**: *\[Gumball's hand emerges from Mr. Robinson's shirt collar\]* But, on the third hand, free child labor!  
**Gaylord**: Mmm... okay.  
**That's still two cons vs one pro, thus this is still a very bad idea on his part +1**

**Darwin**: *\[Finds a diary\]* Look! Her diary! *\[Takes it and goes over to Gumball\]* If we test each page for pheromone levels, we can determine whether or not she experienced a childhood trauma that made her turn evil.  
**Gumball**: *\[Snatches the diary from Darwin\]* ...or we could just read it.  
**Gumball would also be good at CinemaSins +1**

*\[Darwin sets it down and opens it for them both to see. The first photo shows a much younger Margaret Robinson sitting in a boat on a lake, smiling wickedly\]*  
**Darwin**: She looks happy there.  
**Gumball**: Her brother doesn't.  
*\[In the same photo, next to the boat, Margaret's helpless brother is seen drowning\]*  
**Firstly, why the fuck is whoever took this photo just standing there and taking a photo rather than rushing to help Margaret's brother!? +5**

**Secondly, what the fuck!? Did Margaret kill her own brothers/ I mean we never see him and this is the only time he's ever mentioned, so it seems very likely that might have actually died here. And if so that's morbid as fuck +10**

*\[Margaret walks off toward her house, tossing the toy car away disdainfully. It falls into Darwin's open mouth and becomes lodged in his throat, causing him to choke for real! Gumball frantically tries to save him, but Darwin pushes him away\]*  
**Gumball**: Hey! Dude! Let me help!  
**Darwin**: No... no!  
**Dude, what is wrong with you!? Is proving Mrs. Robinson has some good in her seriously worth potentially** ***choking to death*** **over!? +5**

*\[As Darwin chokes, he looks into Mrs. Robinson's eyes, and her terrible eyes gaze into his. Still smiling, she mockingly waves goodbye as she slowly closes the door\]*  
**Okay genuinely what the fuck!? How can** ***anyone*** **see a child choking and not only ignore it but gleefully and sinisterly wave goodbye and close the door on them. I refuse to believe that** ***anyone*** **this evil could actually exist in real life. Even the worst people in the world wouldn't hesitate to save a choking child +20**

*\[Gumball and Darwin toss their walkie-talkies away. They are standing next to their family car\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Pretends to have a walkie-talkie and imitates static\]* Step one: we leave the keys in the door.  
**Darwin**: *\[Imitates static and puts the keys in the door's lock\]* Check!  
**Okay, I can accept Nicole or Richard driving them to the mall, but how the fuck did the get the car keys from them and sneak away from them without them realising? +1**

**Margaret**: Hmmmm!! *\[Cackles\]*  
*\[Mrs. Robinson wraps and ties a bandana around her face like a gangster mask and hijacks the Wattersons' car. As she drives away, Gumball captures a photo of the crime, but their smiles are quickly replaced by looks of worry as they realize the magnitude of their mistake\]*  
**Gumball**: *\[Static sound\]* Uh... step five...?  
**I mean, what did you expect to happen? +1**

*\[As Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka plays in the background, Mrs. Robinson drives the car into the mall. She drives through the glass front doors and Felicity leaps out of the way, screaming. Mrs. Robinson drives in circles around the fountain, forcing shoppers to flee. She drives up the escalator, chasing shoppers up to the next floor. From there, she drives on, chasing shoppers past stores. She drives through a food court and plows through a station of pay phones, sending them flying. A woman who'd been using one of the payphones is left standing with the detached phone in her hand*  
**Guard**: *\[Steps out of a grocery market and yells into his walkie-talkie\]* I don't know! They're wearing a bandana!  
*\[A horde of shoppers rush into the market with Margaret following. The rampaging Margaret speeds down a market aisle past Jackie, who leaps screaming to safety. She clings to the shelf for dear life and looks on, trembling. Gumball and Darwin, still in hot pursuit, show up seconds later\]*  
**Darwin**: She crashed into the cherries!  
**Gumball**: So?  
**Darwin**: They're genetically modified!  
*\[The two duck to the floor as they are avalanched by oversized cherries almost as large as they are\]*  
**Darwin**: She's heading toward the sports department!  
*\[Gumball and Darwin catch up to Margaret with Gumball on a bike and Darwin running alongside. It appears as if the three are in a high speed chase\]*  
**Gumball**: Stop the car! The police are on their way!  
**Darwin**: Go for it, man! I can't go on!  
*\[The car is revealed to be stuck. The front end is propped up on a running treadmill next to a wall of TVs showing a moving background. Gumball is riding an exercise bike, and beside him, Darwin is running on another treadmill. Darwin screams as he is flung away by the rapidly moving treadmill\]*  
**Gumball**: I got this!  
*\[Taking matters into his own hands, Gumball quickly jumps off the exercise bike into the passenger seat of the car. Margaret looks at Gumball with worry as he fastens his seat belt\]*  
**Gumball**: Time to put the brakes on this!  
*\[Gumball pulls the emergency brake and the velocity of the treadmill propels the car backwards out of the sports department, back into the market, through a stack of cereal boxes, through a beauty and hair products section, out of the market, past the destroyed phone station, down the escalator and out of the mall. It shoots through the parking lot, knocking over a shopping cart, and finally crashes into a lamppost. Those outside watch this in shock\]*  
*\[A dazed Margaret steps out of the car as an angered Darwin runs up to her. Gumball follows suit, leaving the vehicle to join Darwin's side and express his disgust for the woman.\]*  
**Darwin**: MRS. ROBINSON! You need to learn that your actions have consequences!  
*\[Margaret looks up in a show of shame\]*  
**Gumball**: One day, you'll understand why we had to stop you. It's for your own good.  
**Margaret**: *\[Shakes the boys' hands\]* Meh... meh...  
**Gumball**: *\[Notices that he is suddenly holding the bandana\]* What the what?!  
**Donut Cop**: *\[Holds out his pointing hand like a gun\]* Drop the bandana and put your hands behind your back!  
**Oh come on, are you seriously telling me that not a single person saw that it was adult woman driving the car? How the fuck do they expect a 12 year old to drive that well anyway? +5**

**Darwin**: *\[Frustrated\]* ISN'T THERE ANY JUSTICE IN THIS UNIVERSE?!  
*\[The damaged lamppost suddenly falls over and hits the back of Mrs. Robinson's car. She loses control and crashes into a sign, which falls on her car as it runs backwards into a telephone pole. From there, it runs forward into the back of a parked car and backward again to hit and dislodge a fire hydrant. A surge of water blasts Mrs. Robinson's car off the ground. It somersaults into the middle of the highway, where a gas truck and a tire truck simultaneously hit it, crushing it like a soda can. Mrs. Robinson is launched out of the car and as she falls to the street, the gas truck's tank springs a leak. Severed by the impact, the wires between the telephone pole and its adjacent pole hang limp and sparking, and gasoline from the truck pools on the ground below Mrs. Robinson. Aware of the danger, Hank and George exit their trucks and run for it\]*  
**Gumball**: Somebody call an ambulance!  
*\[A sparking electrical wire makes contact with the pool of gasoline, igniting a massive explosion that propels Mrs. Robinson miles into the air\]*  
**Margaret**: MEEEEEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHH!  
*\[As Mrs. Robinson descends, a passing plane clips her with its wing, quickening her fall. She finally hits the ground. As an ambulance slowly backs toward her, she slowly, weakly lifts her head to watch. Gumball and Darwin turn away and close their eyes, cringing as the ambulance runs her over off-screen\]*  
**Even for a cartoon, there is absolutely no possible way she should have survived this. She should be** ***dead,*** **period. +5**

1ocqljc,https://www.reddit.com/r/redditserials/comments/1ocqljc/the_immortal_roommate_conundrum_chapter_7/,[The Immortal Roommate Conundrum] Chapter 7,"Alex's life with John—the definitely-immortal roommate who wore Victorian crowns and owned war medals from three centuries—was a non-stop fever dream. His 0.01% of doubt was a distant memory. But when a late-night walk turned into a mugging, an arrest, and a police station scene straight out of a conspiracy thriller, Alex's world tilted so far off its axis he needed a new map.

# The Mugging That Wasn't

It was a chilly Friday night. Alex had convinced John to hit up a dive bar for ""normal roommate bonding""—a flimsy pretext to grill him about the Civil War-era Medal of Honor. After last call, John led them into a sketchy alley.

""Are you insane?"" Alex hissed. ""Nothing good ever happens in an alley!"" ""Shortcut,"" John replied, already stepping into the shadows.

Sure enough, a mugger stepped out, a hoodie pulled low and a cheap switchblade glinting. ""Wallets. Now,"" the guy growled.

Alex's heart hammered. But John just let out a long-suffering sigh. He moved with a speed that defied physics. One moment the mugger was threatening them; the next, he was face-down on the grimy pavement, his arm twisted behind his back in a complex lock.

""You picked the wrong night, buddy,"" John said, calm as ever.

Alex gaped. John now held the switchblade, absently twirling it between his fingers.

""Where'd you learn that?"" Alex squeaked.

""Old job. Security gig."" Security gig. The phrase echoed in Alex's mind, juxtaposed violently with the image of John's military discharge papers. Lieutenant Colonel. Covert Operations.

Before John could decide the mugger's fate, the blinding lights of a squad car painted the alley walls. Two officers emerged. ""Hands in the air! Now!""

Alex's arms shot up. John, however, took a deliberate extra second. With a casual flick of his wrist, he tossed the switchblade into a nearby dumpster—the clang was unnaturally loud—and then slowly raised his hands.

# The Arrest and the Pale-Faced Cops

The cops cuffed both of them, ignoring Alex's frantic protests. In the squad car, Alex hissed, ""Why didn't you just run?""

John, who wore the handcuffs as if they were loose bracelets, shrugged. ""Didn't feel like it. Besides, this will sort itself out.""

At the precinct, Alex vibrated with fear. John looked bored, humming a 1940s tune.

 The booking process was routine for Alex. But when it was John's turn, the officer pressed his fingers to the scanner. The machine beeped, then froze. The officer rebooted and tried again. This time, the screen flashed and died with a blue screen.

On the third attempt, the result was different. The screen lit up with a cascade of red text and flashing warnings. The officer's face drained of all color. He whispered to his partner, who dropped his coffee mug. It shattered on the floor. He didn't stop to clean it up; he just turned and ran into the back offices.

A low buzz filled the precinct. Cops clustered around terminals, shooting nervous glances at John, who was examining his fingernails.

""What the hell is going on?"" Alex whispered.

John winked. ""Paperwork glitch, probably.""

Then, the big door to the back offices swung open and the Police Commissioner himself strode out. His eyes landed on John, and the effect was instantaneous. He walked over, his confidence gone.

""Mr. Harrow, sir,"" the Commissioner began, his voice unsteady. ""I am so sorry for this profound inconvenience."" He gestured for an officer to remove the handcuffs. ""This is a terrible mistake. We had no idea it was you. Your... record... came up.""

He then had Alex uncuffed. ""You are both free to go. No charges. Can we get you a ride home?""

John stood. ""No worries, Commissioner. Mistakes happen. You might want to have your IT guys look at that system."" He nodded. ""Ready to head home, Alex?""

# The Aftermath and Alex's Meltdown

A rookie officer drove them home, apologizing repeatedly. John chatted about potholes.

The moment their apartment door closed, John headed for the kitchen. ""I'm thinking nachos. You in?""

Alex exploded. ""Okay, what the fuck was that?"" he yelled, pacing. ""You take down a mugger like some kind of spec-ops ghost, and then the Police Commissioner grovels? What is in your record? Are you CIA? MI6?""

John, shredding cheese, didn't look up. ""Told you. Paperwork glitch. My fingerprints must be in the system from some old case file. Happens all the time."" The microwave hummed. ""Want jalapeños?""

Alex wanted to scream. He texted Sarah: ""JOHN'S FINGERPRINTS CRASHED THE COP DATABASE. THE COMMISSIONER PERSONALLY APOLOGIZED. I'M LOSING IT.""

 Her reply was a video of her screaming into a pillow, followed by: ""GET HIS PRINTS. WE ARE GOING TO THE FBI.""

# The Immortal Teflon Theory

Alex didn't get the prints. The incident cemented a new layer of understanding: John wasn't just immortal; he was institutionally untouchable. The Commissioner's reaction was the deference you show a threat of unimaginable magnitude.

The next morning, John acted as if nothing happened. He made pancakes, the Russian crown perched on his head, and asked if Alex wanted to play Smash Bros.

And Alex, despite everything, heard himself say, ""Yeah, sure.""

The rent was still cheap, the pancakes were divine, and Merlin was bringing wine. Alex was 100% certain he was living with an immortal who had a rap sheet longer than the Magna Carta.

He wasn't ready to move out. Not yet.

He did, however, get up and lock his bedroom door.",1,1761084396.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

It’s not a traditional self-help book but more like a nourishing place to land when life feels too heavy.
Drawing on Haig’s own experiences with depression and anxiety, the book contains  personal stories, philosophical musings, quotes, and introspective fragments of wisdom. Each page feels like an intimate conversation with a friend who has been through darkness and found small, meaningful ways back to light.
At its heart, The Comfort Book is about acceptance, resilience, and mindful living. It invites the readers to search for comfort in being imperfectly human, in slowing down, and noticing the ordinary moments that give life meaning. It’s the kind of book you don’t rush through; you return to it whenever you need reassurance that it’s okay to simply be.

1ocqg8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKJobs/comments/1ocqg8t/rejected_82k_salary_in_return_for_quieter_life/,Rejected £82k salary in return for quieter life,"I'm 41, and London was once my world. Finding work came easy, the city pulsed with energy, and I thrived on the rush, the pressure, the adrenaline of it all. But somewhere between the crowded Tube carriages and the endless rent payments, I realized the dream had shifted. The prospect of renting forever—or spending a lifetime paying off a mortgage on a 1-2 bed flat—felt less like ambition and more like surrender. So I looked north, toward open skies and second chances.

Now I'm here in Cheshire, earning the same £45k I made in London, but living a different life entirely. Everything feels lighter, more spacious, more within reach. Don't get me wrong—parts of Cheshire still cost a pretty penny—but I no longer feel like I'm running on a treadmill with no way off. I can afford a 3-bed house to rent, and I'm actively putting in offers to buy a place of my own. Not a lifetime of debt, but a home I can truly call mine in a timeframe that feels real and hopeful.

I missed the property train back in those heady London days, but Cheshire has given me something precious: a fresh start. A chance to be mortgage-free in a relatively short time, depending on what I choose and where I land. It's not what I imagined back then, but it's something better—something mine.

Then came the call. Out of nowhere, a recruiter with a golden ticket: £82k, back in London, office every day, 9-5. I went through the interviews, charmed them, got the offer. And then I turned it down.

Even with that salary, even renting, I'd pocket an extra £1-1.5k a month after costs—a substantial amount, no question. But I'd be back in a cramped flat, back on the Tube for an hour or more each way, back in the golden cage guarded by the M25. If I lost that job, I'd be scrambling for another at £45-55k, maybe £60k at best. The risk felt too great. The trade-off, too steep.

Still, some nights I wonder. Up here, I'm a bit stuck with my current employer, but I'm also more relaxed, more lighthearted, more *present*. I loved London's chaos, its glittering distractions, the way it made you feel alive even as it wore you down. But after the cost of living soared, it felt less like a city of opportunity and more like a gilded trap—everyone wanting to be there for the amusements and the money, yet so many quietly miserable beneath the surface.

I had my time in London, and it was good. I return when I can, slipping back into old rhythms—coffee at Primrose Hill with the city sprawling below, long walks along the Southbank as the Thames catches the light, deep breaths of air at Hampstead Heath. Those places still hold magic for me, and they always will.

But up north, there's so much more to discover. In London, it could take an age just to escape past the M25, let alone venture further. Here, the Peak District, Wales, the Lake District, the seaside—they're all within 60-90 minutes' drive. My commute is 25-30 minutes, not an hour-plus underground. The world feels open again.

So, did I make a mistake turning down that London job?

Or did I finally choose freedom?",13,1761084044.0,UKJobs,9,0.76,False

Which if you don’t know, is a movie about three black women that worked at Nasa in the 1960s and the adversity they faced during that time. via I personally think the fact that the audio was trending is very disrespectful. I just told her that it was from a movie about racism in the 1960s and that it shouldn’t be joked about. My stepdad and I got into it after he told me to shut up and that it’s “just an actress in a movie.” I tried to explain it to him but he didn’t want to hear it and told me to stop trying to raise his kids.

Let others chase the fevered blaze,
While I crave a gentler flame.

Give me mornings steeped in silence,
coffee cupped in shared routine,
a quiet laugh across the table,
the warmth that hums unseen.

No grand confessions carved in marble,
no symphonies to stir the skies,
just the knowing glance that steadies,
when the world forgets to try.

Let our days unfold like laundry,
creased but clean, in tender rows.
Let the seasons pass through fingers
as the softest secret grows.

I do not seek a love that dazzles,
only one that stays and stays,
a hand that fits in mine completely,
in the most familiar ways.

>

No context. No link title. Just that.

I clicked the Zoom link he dropped in the chat and joined right on time camera on, coffee in hand, trying to look professional.

The first thing I noticed was that everyone looked… older.  
Like *way* older. Suits, ties, serious faces definitely not my usual team of tired twenty-somethings.

Then one guy says, “Before we begin, let’s welcome our new board intern!”  
And everyone turned and waved at me.

I panicked.  
So what did I do? I waved back. Like a fool.

They started talking about **investment portfolios, stock dividends, and quarterly projections**, while I sat there pretending to take notes on what, I have no idea.

Fifteen minutes in, my actual boss texted me:

>

Turns out, I had clicked the CEO’s link from the company-wide email instead of our department meeting link. I spent half an hour sitting in on a senior executive board meeting I wasn’t even remotely supposed to be in.

When I finally left the call, I accidentally pressed “Leave Meeting for All.”  
And yes… it *kicked everyone out.*

I still can’t make eye contact with anyone from management. But hey, I now know our company’s 5-year investment plan.

(Premature Atrial Contractions) Extra heart beats that you can feel in your throat. Mine started a little over three weeks ago and I have been a wreck since. I’ve been to primary doctor and had an EKG done and all the appropriate blood tests. Everything is normal. But my heart has been doing two quick beats then a long pause before it resets. Sometimes it will do a cluster of three or four quick beats before it pauses and resets. It can do this several times per minute. It got so bad this past Saturday that I went to the ER and while I was being triaged they got so bad it triggered a full blown panic attack. They took me back and monitored me for a couple hours. You could see the PACs on the EKG. I have a cardiology referral but can’t get in for several more weeks. They started me on Propranolol and it seems to have reduced the flutters over the last 2 days but my anxiety is through the roof. A little backstory - I am a HEAVY caffeine drinker. I was probably consuming 650 mg per day in the form of energy drinks, coffee, and diet soda. Then to top it all off I was taking Unisom and melatonin at night to help me sleep. Well about 2.5 weeks ago I drastically cut the caffeine, eliminated the energy drinks, only been having one cup of coffee and maybe one can of Coke Zero later, and also cut the Unisom. It’s been 2.5 weeks and I still feel like I’m having withdrawals. Is that possible? I can’t sleep, I’m nauseous, have no appetite, and this ongoing sense of dread that won’t let up.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Atalanta vs. Slavia Prague: A Tale of Toaster Offenses and Medical Conventions**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a UEFA Champions League clash that’s less *“Game of Thrones”* and more *“Who’s Playing Who?”* Atalanta, the Italian side with a defense as sturdy as a Roman colosseum but an attack that’s about as effective as a toaster in a bakery, hosts Slavia Prague—a team so injury-ravaged, they might need to rent players from a medical convention. Let’s unpack this with the precision of a surgeon (or a bookie calculating implied probabilities).

### Parsing the Odds: Atalanta’s Implied Invincibility

The numbers scream “Atalanta or it didn’t happen.” Bookmakers have priced the Bergamo side at **1.4 to 1.44**, translating to an implied probability of **69-71%** to win. For context, that’s more likely than your cousin finally learning to stop mistaking the “mute” button for “volume up” during Zoom calls. Slavia Prague? They’re a **6.25 to 7.5 underdog**, implying a **13-16%** chance—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of your Monday morning coffee order. The draw sits at **4.95 to 5.1**, or **19-20%**, which feels about right for a game where both teams’ first-half xG totals could be mistaken for a rounding error.

### Digesting the News: A Tale of Two (Very Different) Squads

**Atalanta**: Under Ivan Juric, they’re the *“I’ve got 99 problems but my defense ain’t one”* of Serie A. They’ve drawn five of seven games recently, including a 0-0 snoozer against Lazio where they generated just **0.14 xG in the first half**. Their attack? A mix of “meh” and “meh-er.” Star man Ademola Lookman—fresh off his 28th birthday celebrations—is their spark plug, but even he can’t turn a team with **0.14 xG** into a fireworks show. Still, they showed a glimmer of hope with **2.19 xG against Lazio**, suggesting Juric’s “attacking ideas” might finally escape the realm of PowerPoint presentations.

**Slavia Prague**, meanwhile, is a medical textbook come to life. They’ve lost \*\*12 first-team pl

Something as simple as a comment can cause me to feel like I have a reason to be concerned. 

I feel like people have intentions to manipulate me or are out to cause me problems in my life or effect it in a negative way. 

Something as simple as a frown while making eye contact with me can cause a flood of thoughts in my mind. 

I start to think that the person is out to cause me some kind of damage, I never have evidence to the contrary, so I justify my thoughts and then believe them to be true. 

I miss out on so many things because I feel like people are constantly judging me. 

Be it; taking up a new sport, having a coffee with a friend, playing in the park with my daughters, speaking with colleagues, talking to other parents, to teachers etc etc. 

I try to avoid all of these things as I believe I will eventually be made to feel awful by those around me, it is like they will find a way to belittle me or they have intentions to embarrass me, sometimes it can be even worse like they have some kind of big plan to destroy my life. It’s unbearable at times.

What can also happen is I make connections with things that have no connection. 

A look or a comment becomes inflated in my mind and then I may have another interaction later in the day with a similar thought response and it adds fuel to the fire of paranoia during that day and it continues to grow.

These unconnected connections cause me come to a conclusion along the lines of “they want to make it look like I am ‘x’ or that I did ‘y’ and that’s why they said that, thats why they looked at me like that” 

How can I stop this, what can be done to truly remove this from my life? 

It is not all of the time, it’s most of the time and sometimes it’s worst than others. 

So it’s nearly always there and some days it is more severe than other days. 

It’s really difficult to explain this to people as those who don’t understand it really don’t understand it. 

I hope that a forum such as this one could help me think my way out of this problem. I’m 37 and feel like I have felt like this since I was about 9 or 10. ",1,1761083348.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

1ocq4es,https://www.reddit.com/r/noburp/comments/1ocq4es/post_op_from_myotomy_day_1_and_2/,"Post Op from myotomy, day 1 and 2","Yesterday I had a myotomy surgery done after one round of successful Botox which unfortunately wore off without lasting effects. This is what I’ve experienced so far: 

I went in for surgery around 8:40 AM, and I was out and awake around 12:30 PM. This is when they took me to my room, because Dr. Tritter decided to keep me overnight; I received IV antibiotics during this time, and this also gave them a chance to monitor me for any adverse side effects like fever, etc.

I was prepared for a good amount of pain and not being able to talk for at least a few days, but I was shocked to find myself able to talk *almost* normally as soon as I woke up from anesthesia. After I had some ice cream about 30 minutes later, my pain was barely around a 4 and I could talk with ease. Now, 8 hours later, I’m starting to feel WAY more hoarse…it’s definitely my fault. I got carried away in showing off how good I felt, yapped a bunch, and now my throat is pretty sore. I can talk at a medium whisper with no pain, and it’s only a little tender whenever I swallow. Taking pills is slightly challenging if they’re uncoated, but nowhere near being a choking hazard. The most painful aspect is my jaw being somewhat locked up after having the breathing tube in for surgery. I remember being genuinely terrified by the slow swallow after doing Botox, so now I’m like…that’s it?? This is basically like NOTHING. Keep in mind: I have a decent pain tolerance, and I’ve been put under for surgical procedures so many times at this point that it barely phases me.

We originally discussed a partial myotomy, though Dr. Tritter said he may change his mind once he’s looking in there. He wound up cutting the cricopharyngeus muscle completely, and “closed” the edges on each side. The best way I can describe this would be to imagine cutting a piece of fabric in two, then folding over the cut edge on the each side to sew a smooth “hem”. Is it weird to say he hemmed the muscle? Hopefully that makes some sense!

I’ve been put on a fully liquid diet for 3 days before I can transfer to eating soft foods like mashed potatoes, oatmeal…these high calorie Boost protein shakes are lowkey delicious, so I honestly can’t complain too much. I was a week post-op after getting Botox and I still had immense trouble swallowing literal sludge, and had to wash each bite down with water. I’m genuinely shocked by how different this is, but it makes sense, because you aren’t having that partial paralysis. I did chug a whole sprite— for funsies, mostly— and I haven’t had any signs of a burp, or even a gurgle. I know that my throat is swollen right now and I jumped the gun by drinking soda this early, I just couldn’t help myself!

Edit: Day two, I’ve been discharged home with prophylaxis antibiotics and I’m doing great! I’ve had some gurgling that didn’t become burps, so I’m assuming the muscle is still swollen and healing (understandably). I have a sore throat that feels similar to how it is after swallowing a large pill. My voice is pretty much normal as long as I don’t strain it. Hot coffee and ice cream have been the best, so far, because they both numb the throat. Regular Tylenol every 6 hours (as needed) has been plenty enough for pain relief. Again, keep in mind, my pain tolerance is a bit higher than most (gotta love being chronically ill)— but even so; I think this has been a pretty straight forward procedure with a simple healing process.

1ocq4cz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocq4cz,10 Days in Gorgeous Phuket: This Was My Experience as a Solo Traveler,"Months ago, I took this trip to Phuket. I chose it because it was affordable, beautiful, and safe, so here’s how I planned my 10-day solo travel adventure in Phuket:

Days 1–3: Patong & Karon  
I started my trip in Patong Beach, which is great if you want a mix of nightlife and easy access to everything. I stayed near Bangla Road , it’s loud at night, but full of energy. I paid around $25 USD per night for a small but clean hotel with air conditioning and Wi-Fi. During the day, I’d chill at Karon Beach, which is a lot quieter than Patong. For food, I loved No.9 Restaurant (around $6–8 USD per meal) and the night market near Malin Plaza, where I ate amazing pad thai for just $2 USD.

Days 4–6: Kata & Big Buddha  
Then I moved to Kata Beach, my favorite area,  more relaxed, less crowded, and perfect for sunsets. I rented a scooter for $8 USD/day (plus around $3 USD of gas per day). From here, I visited the Big Buddha,  an impressive statue with panoramic views, and the Karon Viewpoint, one of the best photo spots on the island. I also took a short surf class for $20 USD; it was super fun even as a beginner.

Days 7–10: Old Town & Island Hopping  
For the last few days, I stayed in Phuket Old Town, which has colorful Sino-Portuguese buildings and cozy cafés. I stayed at a cute guesthouse for $20 USD per night. My favorite breakfast spot was The Tent, where I paid around $5 USD for avocado toast and coffee. I also did a Phi Phi Islands tour for $35 USD, including snorkeling, lunch, and transport, totally worth it.

Phuket surprised me in the best way. It’s easy to get around, people are friendly, and you can travel comfortably without spending much. If you’re planning a solo trip, I’d say Phuket is one of the best places to start!",1,1761083246.0,BeautifulTravelPlaces,0,1.0,False

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a Champions League showdown where Sporting Lisbon’s “reliable coffee machine” offense meets Marseille’s “circus-tight” defense. Let’s parse the numbers, news, and nonsense to see who’ll walk away with the glory (and the bookmakers’ slightly smaller cut of your bankroll).

---

### The Odds: A Slight Nod to Home Cooking

The bookmakers have Sporting as favorites (-115 on DraftKings, roughly 52% implied probability), while Marseille sits at +285 (34% implied). The draw? A 3.6 decimal shot, or \~28%. On paper, Sporting’s home advantage and Portuguese league dominance (2nd place, 7W-1L in their last 8) give them a leg up. They’ve scored in every match this season, including a 4-1 CL romp over Kayrat. But here’s the kicker: Marseille is *unreal* right now. They’ve won five straight across all competitions, including a 4-0 dismantling of Ajax, and lead Ligue 1 with a goal differential that makes PSG look like a amateur pick-up team. Their only blemish? A 2-1 loss to Real Madrid… after playing 20 minutes down a man.

---

### The News: No Shoelaces Tripped, But Aubameyang’s Here

Sporting’s lineup is relatively healthy, anchored by star striker **Suarez** (yes, *that* surname, though not the Uruguayan one). Their defense? Well, let’s say it’s “porous enough to fog a mirror” after shipping two to Napoli in their last CL outing. Marseille, meanwhile, is a well-oiled machine. Head coach Roberto De Zerbi isn’t just a name you shout during a game of *Wheel of Fortune*—he’s masterminded a squad that concedes 7 goals per league game (fewest i

1ocpzx6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ocpzx6,"I usually do short lifespan when I play with families, but I decided on a whim to turn off aging with this recent one, and only age them up when it's ""time"" and man. I love this dad, his three boys, and grampa so much.","I was initially inspired by the ""Single Dad's Home"" speedbuild by Simmary on youtube, but it's evolved so much from that original idea.

Introducing the cast;

Nigel Cardwell - gramps, he lives in an apartment just 5 minutes away from the boys so he visits regularly. He's a retired civic planner, he loves the outdoors, and is a general goofball who loves to spend time with his family. - Adventurous, Idealist, and Wise.

Kurtis Cardwell - son to Nigel and dad to three sons, he's a programmer in the tech career, but is also a fairly sporty and outdoorsy person. Like father like son, he loves his family and spends as much time as he can with them, sharing in their interest of video games. He also had to learn how to cook when he became a single father, and now that he knows how to do it, enjoys that as well. - Geek, Glutton, Family-Oriented, and Gloomy.

Greyson Cardwell - the eldest son, he's a bit of a hopeless romantic, and that has lead to multiple breakups through-out high school. He's more reserved than his brothers as a result of that, but learned from his mistakes (gained the romantic sage trait) and has since studied to become a couple's therapist. He's also very much a dog person, maybe a little too much (he kind of really *really* wants a werewolf gf.) - Dog-Lover, Active, Lovebug, Romantic Sage, and Werewolf Ally

Daniel Cardwell - As the middle child (although not much older than the youngest sibling) he's had to fight for recognition. It's hard for one parent to juggle three kids, and so in Daniel's mind he needed to eliviate that struggle by focusing intensely on his studies. He wants to get a high-paying job so that he can be the one to take care of dad when he gets older (or take care of grampa Nigel for that matter, once *he's* too old to take care of himself.) This hyperfocus on studies and work has made his love-life non-existent, but he doesn't really care about that anyway. He's aro/ace, although he probably doesn't know that about himself yet. - Overachiever, Ambitious, Practice Makes Perfect, and Highflier

Reese Cardwell - the youngest child, he's always had a big heart and even bigger feelings. He used to play with a doctor set all the time as a kid, and that interest never went away. Despite being such a compassionate and nice person, he can also be quite mean. He's pretty competitive and a sore loser, as well as a sore winner. Out of the three of them, he's also the one who's the most dead-set on becoming a parent first. - Generous, Outgoing, Competitive

Nalani Mahi'ai - Her and Kurtis met on the beaches of Sulani when he took a week-long vacation while his kids were all in uni. They hit it off really well and after a couple of dinner dates together decided to make it exclusive. Somehow, the fact that she is a mermaid completely went over his head until the last day of vacation. He introduced her to everyone during a Granite Falls lodge vacation, and she moved in about a week later. They've since tied the knot, and had a little girl together (still newborn in-game.)

Ruth Rowell - (lilsimsie's black and white cas challenge sim) she matched with Reese on Cupid's Corner and had a little coffee shop date. She was finishing her history degree while he had just started on his biology degree, so after the small meet-up went so well they decided to study together in the library. They were completely smitten with each other and got absolutely no work done. They ended up becoming a couple though! Ruth is currently a substitute teacher, and is just as in love with the idea of becoming parents with Reese as he is.

Lady Cardwell - lastly but not least-ly, there's little Lady the golden retriever. They've had her since she was a little puppy and Greyson was a kid - she was actually Greyson's winterfest present that year! She's getting up there in age now though, and probably doesn't have much time left. That doesn't stop her from acting like a puppy still. Her favorite activities includes; running around the house, dancing with Nigel, and tackling her family to the ground whenever they get home from work or school. Oh and she loves Nigel, a *lot*, she howls up a storm whenever it's mentioned that he's coming.

That's all :)  
A lot of these details are, of course, roleplay, make-believe, and extrapolations from the interactions that do happen in the game. Anyway, can you guys tell I'm obsessed with this family?",6,1761082948.0,Sims4,0,1.0,False

This cafe will do Italian Coffee and French Pastries extremely well, rivaling any coffee shop in Italy or bakery in Paris. The menu will be extremely limited and unchanging, allowing unrivaled quality control.

Drinks are espresso, macchiato, cappuccino, latte. Food is croissants and pain au chocolates. The pastries will not be like the typical croissants you find at every American coffee shop, but will rival the quality of those found at every coffee shop in Paris (the difference is astounding). It's doable in the US, it just requires importing the ingredients (French flour & butter) and putting in the laborious but worthwhile effort (process starts 3 days in advance).

For reference, I went to the Lycée most of my childhood and lived in Paris — my parents currently live in Florence.

Sometimes it will do a cluster of three or four quick beats before it pauses and resets. It can do this several times per minute. It got so bad this past Saturday that I went to the ER and while I was being triaged they got so bad it triggered a full blown panic attack. They took me back and monitored me for a couple hours.

I was probably consuming 650 mg per day in the form of energy drinks, coffee, and diet soda. Then to top it all off I was taking Unisom and melatonin at night to help me sleep. Well about 2.5 weeks ago I drastically cut the caffeine, eliminated the energy drinks, only been having one cup of coffee and maybe one can of Coke Zero later, and also cut the Unisom.

Snack - corn flakes, soya milk with yogurt and fruit! 10/10

Today was a pretty good day, but I didn't allow myself any extras and struggled a bit with portions! My anxiety was high about tomorrow and also dealing and accepting the fact I am actively now gaining weight and can see and feel my body changing again, like in hospital. Logically this is what I want but it is really, really difficult as I haven't let myself gain weight is years. The only time I was able to gain weight successfully was in the hospital. 

I am struggling massively with thoughts such as 'I have taken it too far', 'I have eaten enough now and need to go back to the way I was before', 'I don't deserve this food and no one eats this much'. All stupid ED thoughts that drive me mad, but I know the only way out is to challenge these thoughts and keep eating the plan. I have to keep reminding myself, this is my life now, I don't want to go back - I can't afford to. 

My ED is also convincing me I will gain the weight and then have to go back to restricting otherwise I will loose control, but I had a good chat with my sister and she said hopefully I will get to the point where food is pretty much neutral - you eat what you enjoy, when hungry and stop when full and your body just settles at a 'happy weight'. It's like the set point theory, which I believe in, even if my ED doesn't. I can't wait to get to this point, where food doesn't consume my every thought. But she reminded me, I have a long way to go and it won't happen overnight. For now, eat the meal plan. Intuitive eating/calorie counting isn't for me and tbh I don't know if it ever will be and I need to learn and accept that's okay. If I need to rely on a meal plan (from my dietician) to keep me right, that's okay - everyone has different needs and ultimately I know (from experience) once I start fucking about with numbers it NEVER ends well. The same with when I am left 100% to my own devices, the ED is too strong and it spirals. It is hard because I want so badly to be normal again, go back to a normal life but I am not there yet :(. I also feel so ashamed being 21 and relying so much on my dad (who is 69) and honestly struggling with the fact he has to watch me so closely and be with me so much. We love each other but with any relationship there are limits. 

Part of me is wondering if I would be better in hospital to get my BMI to even 15 and take the pressure off my dad, but he said he is happy to continue to support me now I am really trying.

-the real: they allow you to eat SO MUCH for free. If you work 8 hours you can eat two full hot meals including hash browns, waffles, proteins. And between you and me, most managers will hook you halfway up with food if you’re hungry and you’re workin.- it’s not just about the food. 2 huge high calorie meals a day is money saved in groceries. 
Tons of coffee.
They bounce you around locations (one at almost every exit) if you have a car so no one notices if you work a shift, drive to your next one and camp right in the parking lot, work and then camp at the next one etc.

Hey, thanks for stopping by! Just putting myself out here to hopefully make some lasting friendships. If you like occasional banter, usually meaningful conversations, mistimed jokes, exchanging little nuggets from everyday life, and even sharing thoughts that won't be spoken out loud, read on! 

I'm from Australia, working full-time. I volunteer sometimes and spend the rest of my time cooking, reading, budgeting, contemplating life choices, and dealing with casual bouts of existential crisis. I've been on a dedicated health journey since 2017, and kind of proud of all the progress. I've learned, unlearned, relearned a lot on my own, and am always looking to deepen and expand my knowledge that I can practically apply. I don't smoke. I'd like to say that I don't do drugs either, but that'd be a non-truth considering the amount of coffee I drink before midday. I only occasionally drink alcohol but prefer avoiding it mostly. I recently rediscovered the joy of listening to audio books after a long pause. Personality wise, I'm typically a calm and collected guy. I'm not constantly seeking the next dopamine spike or adrenaline rush. I'm irreligious but respect people's choice to believe. I value balance, respect, peace, and sincerity.

If your interest is piqued by now, I'd love to read from you. Whether you are from Down Under or anywhere else on the globe, you are welcome to reach out. There are extra large value-added brownie points for you if you also use the Oxford comma as a rule 😉

I have seen so much all around Reddit for months now of Eden Coffee and Co. I followed the story from before they open to now. The owners clearly had a racist past with homophobia and transphobia of course following. I forgot about it until once again, they opened the cafe and there was a new Reddit post about them but this time the owners said the “racist” twitter account that was linked to the owner was fake and at first I felt stupid for believing it until I realized that during the first time the allegations were being made, the twitter account was changed and then later deleted. If it was sold then how come as things were going on the twitter account was changing at the same time? On top of that one of the owners, Jordan was in fact an onlyfans model under the name Jacob Parker and you can still see the history of this on this lpsg link. https://www.lpsg.com/threads/parker-jacobs.698061/page-21 it goes all the way back to 2021. His onlyfans followers said themselves that he was straight meanwhile posting gay content, was republican, etc. There’s nothing wrong with being an onlyfans model or changing your opinions over time but with this all happening immediately at the same time as your opening up a business and trying to scrub the internet, it’s clearly pointing to the fact that it’s true. I’m not sure where his wife ties into all of this since her internet footprint is only about her being a realtor but clearly she married this man so she must have the same beliefs. I didn’t want it to be true because I missed having a cafe in the Chevrolet building but I’m glad that I can finally come to a conclusion on what’s fact and what’s not. If the owners can explain how any of this makes sense I’d like to hear but I’m 99% sure from what I found online that what everyone is saying is true. ",2,1761081348.0,edencoffeeandco,0,1.0,False

And we wonder where is the ice cream?,"My grandma was my best friend and I miss her. And like me, she was weird. I don't use weird in a demeaning way. I wear my 'weird' badge with pride. There was only one person like her and that was her. She provided much entertainment throughout me growing up and I miss her terribly everyday. It's been years since she has passed, but I never feel far from her. Grandma, I love you and this is for you....

Unfortunately paranoia and over cautiousness runs in my mother's family. I am a paranoid person and attribute my paranoid thoughts to be inherited from them. My mother's mother, my grandmother, always seemed to one up anyone when it came to the paranoid meter. My grandmother was a news fanatic. She indulged in every tabloid regardless of its validity. Pulse stopping headlines were truly pulse stopping to her. She'd read something like, ""Poison Cloud Over Georgia"" and would take a deep breath and shudder, having to stabilize herself on her coffee table.

Well, one unbearably hot summer day, my grandmother and I were walking the block. Well, she was walking, as I was on my bicycle and testing out my training wheels. And then I heard that all so familiar sound that still makes my heart skip to this day. The light jingle of bells echoed around me. It was 'Turkey in the Straw' or as known to the entire world, the ice cream truck theme song. I looked up as the ice cream truck rounded the corner slowly.

""Grandma!,"" I yelled. ""Grandma! Please can we get some ice cream!""

My grandmother looked at the ice cream truck in pure terror. Her eyes widened as her knees shook in anxiety. She stumbled towards me and grabbed my 'Pokemon' shirt, pulling me towards her.

""Get over here,"" she gasped for breath. ""Hurry! You must hurry!""

""Grandma?,"" I said trying to tug free. ""What's wrong?""

My grandma let go of my shirt as the ice cream truck came to a stop in front of us. Her eyes went from wide saucers to narrow slits. I knew when her eyes got like this was when she was mad. Because last time her eyes were like this was when she was denied her free senior drink at Taco Bell. I stepped back now feeling scared myself.

""You murderer!,"" my grandmother howled, with her veined fists shaking in the wind. She stepped towards the ice cream truck as the man stepping out of it, saw her and immediately stumbled backwards into the truck.

""POISON!,"" my grandmother growled. ""POISON! POISON! POISON!""

""Geez lady,"" the guy said. ""What did I do?""

Other kids had come out of their homes and their parents and them stood in horror watching as my four foot eight grandma waddled towards the ice cream man and spat more words of hate at him. He clawed towards his seat and hopped back up, revving his engine.

""GET OUT OF HERE!,"" my grandma yelled. ""MONSTER! YOU MONSTER!""

As the ice cream truck peeled out of the cul-de-sac, I stood silent, just in pure shock. My grandma grabbed me again and basically dragged me back home, as I struggled to keep my bike with me. It would be years before I found out what made my grandmother so irate.

My mom sat me down and told me that after my grandmother got us home, she dialed her up sobbing, saying how the ice cream man tried to kill her little boy. My grandmother cried about reading a newspaper article where a young boy had died from poisoned ice cream somewhere 2,000 miles from us.

All of that stemmed from a news article my grandmother stumbled across. This is just one of the many stories I have of my grandmother and others in my family.

It was the first time I’d seen him as a commander, not a teacher.

“I said, stand up *straight*, soldier.”

“What a fucking asshole,” the guy holding me hissed. His body went rigid when Nick obeyed, his palm pressing harder over my mouth, like he knew I was about to lose it. 

I forced myself still, swallowing the urge to squeeze my eyes shut.

Nick stood motionless, arms by his sides, staring straight ahead into nothing. When Fuller pulled out a crumpled tissue to wipe the boy’s bloody nose, my stomach turned. 

That smug, triumphant look, the same one he always wore in class contorted his expression. 

He circled Nick like a predator, inspecting every inch of him.

Nick trembled, eyes flickering, lips quivering, whatever humanity was left inside him was slipping away. 

Fuller didn’t care.

“You’re a fighter, aren’t you?” he said, almost amused.

The man chuckled. “Even while suffering the first signs of defection, what appears to be a hemorrhage, you’re still standing. Impressive.”

Nick didn’t respond. I watched rivulets of red trail down the curve of his throat.

“One of our strongest minds,” Fuller said, pride swelling in his voice. 

He turned to the soldier beside him. 

“This boy marks the beginning of something extraordinary. I want every defective recruit that’s still breathing brought in. He’s part of a batch with potential. Proof lies in his resilience, his ability to withstand defection.”

He shoved Nick, but my friend didn’t even flinch.

“If processing failed the first time, we’ll keep at it until it doesn’t. Recruit 13 is an anomaly we welcome. Run another cleanse to make sure the former personality has been fully erased.”

“Yes, sir.” The soldier nodded.

Fuller folded his arms, narrowing his eyes at Nick. “Recruit 13. How are you feeling right now?”

“I feel nothing,” Nick said flatly.

“Uh-huh.” Fuller stepped closer, until they were almost touching. “What about thoughts? Anyone come to mind? Friends? Family? You were quite vocal before we purged that personality. Do you still want to tear me apart, Nicholas?” 

His tone turned mocking. “What was it you said when I strapped you down and gave you anesthesia you didn’t deserve? Ah, yes. You were going to rip out my eyes, stick them up my ass, and make me eat them.”

A sick satisfaction gleamed in his eyes. He knew Nick would obey now, no matter what. Fuller shoved him back again.

“Such a sharp tongue, Nicholas,” he sneered. “I hope you know I enjoyed severing it from your filthy mouth.” 

He leaned in, voice low and cruel. 

“And I enjoyed stripping every independent thought that ever dared bloom in that hollow brain of yours.” 

Fuller tapped Nick’s head with a smile. “You were born to be an Aceville soldier. And might I say, you’re my favorite one yet.”

The teacher seemed to revel in antagonizing the boy, yet I couldn’t ignore the flicker of urgency in his tone. 

He wasn’t just enjoying the power he held over Nick, he was ensuring that every trace of the boy was erased.

“I said speak!” he snapped.

Nick answered through a mouthful of glistening, pooling red. “I have no thoughts, sir.”

Fuller’s grin made my stomach turn. “Does the name Benjamin Castor mean anything to you?” 

This time he leaned in uncomfortably close. 

The real Nick would have spat in his face. 

“Your father hated you from the start,” he murmured. “As for your mother, the moment you were born, we slaughtered and then incinerated her.” He stepped back. 

“Beth wasn’t on the same page as us. I worked with her. Agent Carter was one of our best. She could put a bullet in any kid’s skull without hesitation, but somehow, we lost her to you.” 

Fuller’s lip curled in disgust. “That’s right. Beth bonded with you while you were still inside her. I’d never seen anything like it. She actually cared for you, the genetically modified fetus we implanted in her. She saw you as more than a tool, more than a cog in our machine. She saw you as her son.”

He sneered. “A shame you survived the programming. Mother and son could have been reunited, the traitor and her failed experiment.”

My teacher’s words cut deep. Nick’s hope had been to meet the mother he never knew. 

Fuller wanted to see if any part of him would break, if anything remained to purge. 

He shoved Nick, but Nick didn’t budge. “You weren’t even born yet, and somehow you managed to turn one of our own against us.” 

His laugh was sharp and bitter. “And what about Elizabeth Carter, your pathetic mother, who let emotion get the better of her and paid for it with her blood?""

“I feel nothing,” Nick said.

But I caught it, the hesitation, the small pause between his words.

Fuller didn’t notice. He straightened, giving a satisfied nod.

“Interesting. I thought some part of him might hold on, maybe wouldn't be affected by the new serum. But recruit 13 is empty. He’s defecting. Which means he needs to be processed immediately.”

His brows pinched. Then he twisted and swung a punch at Nick’s face.

I expected his fist to land and Nick to hit the ground, but my friend moved faster than I’d ever seen, springing to life. Only it wasn’t the kind of awareness I wanted. 

It was whatever they had put inside him, the so-called sleeper, triggered by a direct attack. Nick was quick, his face blank as he ducked and grabbed the instructor by the neck, lifting him clean off the floor.

It didn’t seem real. Just weeks ago, Nick could barely carry me for a piggyback ride. 

Now he was something else entirely, exactly what Fuller wanted him to be. The man let out a shriek of laughter, a grin spreading across his face.

“Yep,” said the guy holding me, pulling me down behind a tree. I could smell the metal from his gun as it brushed my ear. “Fuller’s just as batshit crazy as I remember, and he calls himself an agent?”

“Fascinating!” My teacher, still in Nick’s stranglehold, choked out. “This one is defecting, and his reaction times are perfect!”

He barked at Nick to let him go, and the boy’s grip around his neck loosened, allowing him to hit the ground. The teacher was barely fazed before going in again. 

This time, he went for the kill, shoving the boy backward with one hand while reaching into his jeans with the other to pull out his glock. 

Again, it was like watching a movie. 

With vacant eyes and movements driven purely by reflex, Nick disarmed the weapon, slammed the teacher to the ground, and pressed the barrel into the back of his skull.

The teacher was playing with his toy. 

Next, Nick was ordered to disarm another soldier, this time without using his hands. To my shock, he managed it. With a simple jerk of his hand, the magnum slammed into the flesh of his palm.

As if driven by an invisible force.

“Okay, you’ve got to admit, that’s impressive,” the British guy whispered. “They must have upgraded the specs. I’m pretty sure our class never got whatever I’m looking at.”

After a moment, Fuller composed himself. “If his brain can submit again, and we manage to preserve the body, we’ve struck gold with this year’s recruits.” He straightened his jacket.

“Yes, we may have lost many due to errors,” he continued, eyes gleaming, “but our survivors? Look at them! I’ve never seen strength and reaction times like this, not to mention psychic abilities on par with our 2018 class. If we can capture every defector still breathing and reprogram them, this year will be our best yet. Nicholas is living proof.”

The boy holding me groaned. “Yeah, I’m not listening to this shit. That man is a psycho.”

When he dragged me back, my body reacted automatically. 

“No!” I tried to scream into his hand, but he was too fast.

I wanted to say I wouldn’t leave Nick to that fate again, but his hold on me was impossible to break. 

He pulled me into the trees once more. Twisting my head, I caught a glimpse of Nick being led away with the others. 

I struggled all the way to the clearing, where he finally dropped me into a heap before letting out an exasperated breath.

I hit the ground face first, getting a mouthful of dirt and leaves.

When I lifted my head, a familiar blur of golden curls lay next to me. Bobby. She was on her back, eyes shut peacefully, scarlet trails staining her chin.

Bobby was still defecting.

“Sam.”

A familiar voice sounded, like wind chimes. “You don’t have to be so rough.”

When I glanced up, the blonde I thought I’d hallucinated earlier was standing over me. 

Her face was unmistakable, pretty features carved into perfect, porcelain skin that was paler, a lot paler. 

She looked older, though only by a few years, early twenties maybe.

Her hair fell in unbrushed ringlets that she had to sweep out of her eyes, no longer in the childish ponytail I remembered from all those years ago. 

I was still seeing her younger self.

I had never forgotten her, Clara Danvers, sprinting across rough tarmac, frenzied, wide eyes. Those eyes had once been full of childlike fear. When I looked into them now, they were hollow, haunted.

For a moment, I was caught between wrapping my arms around the girl I’d thought was dead and jumping up to grab Bobby and run back to Nick. I needed to know he was okay. To know that he truly had been hesitating. That he was still in there somewhere.

I was shaking when the girl loomed over me, her arms crossed over a ratty jacket. She moved slowly, like I was a rabid animal. I wanted to scream at her and the guy for taking me away from Nick. But before I could, she held out a hand for me to grab.

Clara’s smile was kind. “You’re Adeline, right?”

I managed to nod, letting her pull me to my feet.

In the dim light of the afternoon bleeding through the trees, I could finally see the guy. 

I could tell just by looking at him that his younger self had been on the varsity team. Sam was an older version of Nick, with the same hollow eyes as Clara that aged him well past twenty-two. 

Blinking rapidly through the rays of sunlight seeping through the trees, I glimpsed short reddish curls slipping from beneath a baseball cap. 

His features were kind, though a sardonic twist lingered in his lips. 

I could tell that, once, this boy had laughed. Maybe even been the class joker.

It was hard to look at him without noticing the gnarly scar that sliced below his left eye and cut across his nose. 

He lifted a hand in a sarcastic wave. “Thanks for biting me,” he muttered. Sam’s British accent was a lot stronger now that he wasn’t whispering. “Twice.”

Ignoring him, I shuffled over to Bobby. Her nosebleed was getting worse, I thought, and I knew what that led to. 

But when I gingerly grazed the tips of my fingers under my own nose, I realized I was no longer bleeding. Not just that, the thunderclap headaches that had sent my thoughts spiraling were gone.

When I crouched in the dirt and pulled Bobby to my chest, Clara knelt beside me. “I’d keep your distance,” she said softly. “Right now, that’s not who you think it is.”

I got to my feet, struggling to stay upright. “Then who, or what, is she?”

“Right now?” Sam shrugged. “A defecting soldier.” He jutted his chin. “Just like your mate.”

“No,” I said, even when yes burned on my tongue. “No, she wouldn’t—”

“He’s right, Adeline,” Clara murmured. When I turned to look at her, her smile had curved into a frown. She folded her arms across her chest. “You need to understand that right now, that isn’t Robyn Atwood. At least, it won’t be until she dies.”

“What?” I whispered, a chill creeping down my spine. “What are you talking about?”

The two of them exchanged glances, and after what looked like a telepathic conversation between them, Clara sighed.

“Adeline, she’s going to be okay,” she said softly. “As long as her Zero is active, she’s fine.”

My hand grazed the back of my neck, and I was reminded of the thing inside me.

Mr. Fuller had called it that, a Zero. Whatever was inside Nick and Bobby. The entirety of my class.

Sam groaned and flopped onto the ground, picking up a stick and snapping it in half. 

Pulling resting his head in his arms, he sighed, a small, unguarded gesture that revealed the boy still inside him, the one who had been forced to grow up too fast. 

“Oh, boy.” Sam shot Clara a crooked smile, resting his chin on his knee. “You're better at explaining. You know I suck at describing shit.” 

Clara nodded. “Fine.” 

She plopped down next to him, her dark brown eyes tracing the sky above us, distant and wistful. 

“I guess we should start from the beginning.” 

Her smile was bright, but her eyes betrayed her; she did not want to revisit what came next. 

“Like you, Adeline,” she said quietly, “I was a defect.”

She tilted her chin toward Sam. “We both were. They said my brain couldn’t handle it.”

The bottom dropped out of my stomach. Suddenly I was back in the facility, my head pounding, blood dripping down my chin, my hand tangled in Nick’s. 

*Her brain couldn’t handle it*, Mr. Fuller had said with that smug smile.

Clara’s throat-clearing snapped me back. Her eyes had darkened. 

Her head tipped back,  gaze flicking to the cloudless sky. “You already know the gist of it, so I won’t go into detail. Mr Fuller, my mother, and everyone I've ever known…” she sniffled, squeezing her eyes shut. “They killed my friends.” 

Her voice wavered. “There were thirty-six seniors in our class, and we’re the only ones who made it out.”

She steepled her fingers, a small, habitual motion that looked like something she did to keep herself from falling apart. Clara was her own anchor. 

She pulled her knees to her chest, all of her trembling, like she was back there. 

“They lined us up. Like you, we were just kids thinking we were at some kind of summer camp.” She shot me a grin. “I saw you that day.” Clara’s eyes filled with tears. 

“Adeline Calstone watching me from the shadows. I didn't want to scare you. You were a kid, and I guess…” Clara let out a breath. “I guess part of me figured maybe summer camp wouldn't be so bad.” 

I revelled in the way she held herself together; a paper doll, fragile, fraying at the edges. But refusing to tear. “So, I let the teacher grab me.”

For a moment, I thought she would manage to tell her story without breaking.

“I had a boyfriend,” Clara whispered. Her eyes were faraway again. Lingering on the trees. “His name was Jonas.” Clara's tone splintered, breaking into a hiss. 

“He was standing next to me. Jonas, my first love. My first kiss. He was my first everything. We planned to take a year out, travel the world. See every country. Make memories before going to college on opposite sides of the world.” 

Clara exhaled shakily. “I didn’t even have time to process it. One moment, Jonas had his arms around me, promising we’d escape. His head was on my shoulder, and he was screaming. He told them to stop, told them he surrendered.”

I watched her body jerk, her fingers trailing up and down her arm, like she could still feel him.

“The next, I was covered in his blood. Jonas was everywhere. He was in my hair, I could taste him in my mouth.” 

Clara giggled. She was breathless suddenly, grasping onto Sam’s arm, squeezing until he murmured to her. “Jonas tasted like spaghetti sauce, and he felt like nothing.” Her voice cracked. 

“His brains were pooling beside me, Adeline, and they didn’t care. They just kept killing my friends.”

Her voice broke into a cry. “I begged them. I told them to fucking kill me too.”

“Hey.” Sam’s eyes were soft. “Hey, take it easy. What did we say? Not all at once.”

Clara nodded. “I’m okay.”

The girl sniffled, wiping at her nose. “Two of the soldiers were talking. I was the only one left standing. They were already ordering the others to start disposing of the bodies, and in that moment, I realized I had only two choices: stay and wait to die, or take a chance and run for my life.” 

Her smile was haunted. “I ran. I ran from them. Jonas, Liv, and Isabelle. I watched them drag away the bodies of my friends. Then I followed the others, the blues and purples, into the facility.”

Her relief was mine too. Sitting in that uncomfortable silence following her retelling the murder of her friends, was overwhelming. “That’s when I found Sam.” She drew in a shaky breath.

“Sam was alive. He was dragged right off the bus when he punched a teacher in the face, and knocked out.” 

Clara let out a short, bitter laugh. “He was always getting into fights at school. I guess this time it saved him. They drugged him so he wouldn’t wake up and just threw him on the floor.” 

She sniffled again. “Sam was barely responsive, lying in a pile of our dead friends. But he was okay. He wanted to go back, wanted to take all of them out. Get our revenge.” She shot him a watery grin. 

“Let’s just say Sam was pretty vocal under some serious anesthesia.” Clara’s smile faded. “I took a chance. Sam was the only one left, the only red that survived, and I lifted him into my arms and ran.”

Sam nodded, tracing his scar. He was smiling. “Yeah.” He shot the girl a warm smile. 

“Princess Clara Danvers, who teased me for admitting in sophomore year, had saved me.” He pointed at himself. “Me. The damsel in distress.”

His smile curled. “You did drop me twice, though. I’m blaming my sudden influx of headaches on you.”

Clara gave him a playful shove, and comforted by her presence, he shifted closer, letting her rest her head on his shoulder. Sam leaned in, reaching for her hand. On the surface, they didn’t match: freak and valedictorian, outcast and princess. 

But somehow, they fit. 

I could see exactly what Sam was doing, making it easier for her to tell their story. 

I wondered if he was all Clara needed to stay afloat, to keep her breathing, to keep her head above water, just like Nick had been for me. 

When I lost Bobby, when she was taken inside to be processed, I had clung to Nick with everything I had. 

“Anyway,” Clara said, wringing her hands in her lap. “We got out.” She gestured behind her. 

“There’s nothing back there but a dead end. A ravine. Back then, we thought…” Her voice choked. 

“We thought it was the best choice. My mom wasn’t real. My family. My town. None of it was. It was all a setup for some messed-up experiment. We were completely alone. Nobody was coming for us and if they were, it was only for our fucking body parts.”

Clara let out a bitter scoff. “Eventually, Mom found us. She told me they wanted my heart to give to some kid in the real world who needed it. She said they had to take it while it was still healthy, before my body started rejecting the program after my brain. They wanted Sam’s organs for a full transplant.” 

Her hand went to her chest. 

“It was my heart,” she said softly, and I couldn’t help but notice her use of the past tense. “I didn’t care if I wasn’t supposed to be real, if we were just skins and pretty faces for their soldiers, and I was nothing but body parts ready for donation. They weren’t taking me. And they weren’t taking Sam.”

I was hit with a wave of realization. “You jumped.”

Sam nodded. “Wouldn't you?"" 

“The ravine wasn’t what we were expecting,” Clara said softly. “We expected to.. well, we expected to die.”

Sam leaned back on his elbows with a sigh. “Imagine our surprise when we didn’t get obliterated on sharp rocks and ended up in the sea.” 

His laugh was easy, and I found myself drawn to it, a welcome distraction from their story. 

“Yeah, that’s right,” he added, tipping his head back and frowning at the sky. 

“Aceville’s an island. Those psychos bought it and built it to look exactly like a normal American town.”

I waited for Clara to continue, but her gaze seemed distant. Sam, noticing, took over. 

“Anyway,” he said, glancing at her, his eyebrows knitting together with concern. 

“Since we weren’t that far out, we swam to shore. And it turns out there’s an entire place built for this experiment. The people running it live there with their families, including kids, teenagers, and the elderly. It’s a whole community devoted to creating us.” 

“Aceville soldiers are made here and then sent off to train as the country’s top defense.” He chuckled. “They really trust eighteen-year-old, brainwashed super soldiers with the nuclear codes.”

Clara shoved him. “Shush.” She rolled her eyes at me before continuing. 

“We found an old abandoned house. I think it was here long before they built the research facility or the apartment blocks for the workers’ families.” Her expression darkened. “But we were dying,” Clara whispered. “We were vomiting blood, with headaches like thunderclaps. Bleeding out of every orifice–”

“Clara.” Sam rolled his eyes. “I've just had my lunch.” 

She elbowed him. “We were too weak to find food or water, so that night we just lay on bug-infested floorboards, waiting to die. The roof had caved in, so we could see the stars.” The girl smiled faintly. 

“It was… pretty. Peaceful. Painful. I remember having to gag my screams, rolling back and forth as my body bled out. But it was so *human*, and I would give anything to feel it again.” 

Clara's voice faltered. “That night, I knew I was going to die. I told Sam I loved him. I fell asleep knowing my heart was still in my chest and that it was still mine.”

Her eyes glistened with tears. “I was at peace knowing I could die far away from that awful place.”

“And surprise, surprise?” Sam sent me a smirk.

I frowned at him. “You didn’t?” I caught myself. “You didn’t die, I mean.”

He shook his head. “Oh no, we did.”

His words sent my thoughts into a tailspin.

“I don’t understand.”

“Duh.” The boy’s smile was teasing. “Haven’t you worked it out yet? We died.” He threw a branch at me. “You see dead people.”

“Ignore him.” Clara turned and prodded him in the cheek.

“Ow.” His response was more sarcastic than pained.

“But he’s not wrong.” Clara gave me a weak, uneasy smile. “First of all, it’s not technically dying,” she said. 

“Think of it more like rebooting. The defections did kill us, yes, but we were brought back. The thing in our necks, what they call a Zero, was implanted for one purpose. Humans naturally die, right? We all have an expiration date.”

She drew idle circles in the dirt. “Aceville soldiers don’t. Not because of who we are, but because of what they made us for. If we’re shot in the head, we come back minutes later, stronger than before.""

""Mr. Fuller was right. They strip away our humanity so it doesn’t hurt. When you die and come back enough times, it stops mattering. In a way, it’s merciful, the mind control, I mean. It dulls everything.""

Something was wrong. I realized it too late. 

I should have seen it earlier, when Bobby was squeezing the breath from my lungs, and somehow, I still had breath left to take.

“That’s what happened to you.”

Clara’s voice softened. “Earlier, when you were defecting, you died, Adeline. It happened to Sam and me, and to the few kids we’ve managed to save. We’re rare cases, those who defect and come back before they can incinerate us.”

Her tone hardened. “That’s why they get rid of us the moment our brains start to turn.”

“Because we’ll rise again,” Sam added. “Trust me, it’s not as Hollywood blockbuster as you think. In the movies people come back in seconds. Initially, it takes a while for us to fully revive. You took nearly an hour.” He offered a smirk. 

“We don’t eat brains, so stop looking at me like that. No superpowers, unfortunately. We’re like Captain America before he was made into Captain America.”

“But…” I was struggling to take in his words. All I could see were my own fingers slick with Nick’s blood, and the tiny device I’d crushed between my index and forefinger. “My… my friend—”

He cut me off. “Your mate Nick? Well, as for the others, it’s a different story. He was a success initially, before he defected, so yeah, he’s nothing like our lame asses. They’ve definitely upgraded their programming. Nick’s more of a Black Widow, I’d say. The kid’s got moves.” 

Sam caught my eye, his lip curving into a pout. 

“Sorry. I know I should be relieved that my brain can’t compute with the program, but come on, I want superpowers too.”

“They’re not superpowers,” Clara said stiffly.

Sam shrugged. “And since their programs didn’t work on us, we kept our minds, rendering us walking corpses.""

Their words didn’t feel real.

I was dead.

No, I thought, even when I knew they were right. I had stopped bleeding. Stopped defecting. The headaches were gone.

“No,” I heard myself say. “No, I’m alive.”

Though it came out more like a question.

Clara’s smile was sad. “That’s what I thought too,” she said. “Until I…” She trailed off, her hand pressing over her chest.

I wanted to copy her, I wanted to, but I couldn’t. If I did, if I placed my hand over my heart and felt nothing, I’d start screaming and never stop.

My mind snapped back to Kenji Leonhart, his body draped over a soldier’s back. The blood running down the back of his shirt. He wasn’t a red.

Which meant he was a blue or a purple, one of the first to defect, one of the first kids who wasn’t a red to be incinerated.

If only Nick and I had gone back for him. Then we might have been able to save him. But how could we have known? How could we have known that he’d come back?

I couldn’t help it. My eyes were stinging, but the tears didn't come.

“Am I even human?”

Clara grabbed Sam’s hand and squeezed. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I haven’t felt my heartbeat in so long. And yet I age. I can smell and taste. Eating and sleeping are hard. I can only manage coffee right now, but I don’t get tired. I should feel human, right?”

She tried to smile. “It’s like my body is pretending to be alive so I don’t freak out. I can breathe, but it doesn’t feel natural when I pay attention to inhaling and exhaling.” She sighed. “Really, it’s cruel. I feel synthetic pain, but it’s not real pain.”

She laughed, though it came out choked. “I guess the device is supposed to mimic real human pain, though I don’t understand why they’d do that to a bunch of brain-dead super soldiers. We’re supposed to be mindless. Most of the time, I can deal with it. But it never goes away.”

The girl lay her head on Sam’s shoulder again, grasping for his hand, and I felt that connection between them. 

“That feeling, Adeline. Knowing I’m dead, knowing the only thing keeping me going is the device in the back of my neck and the program in my brain that doesn’t work. My body’s a puppet, and without it, I’d drop dead for real.”

“Is there a way to… stop it?” I managed to get out.

“Defecting?” Sam shrugged.  “I’ve never seen a kid recover.” He jutted his chin at Bobby. “Your friend’s got a better chance with a real doctor on the mainland.”

“How long does she have?”

“Judging from her nose, I’d say it’s early defection. Maybe a few hours.”

“Nick.” Something cold slithered through me. I shakily got to my feet. “I took it out of him. Does that mean…”

Sam whistled. “Without that freaky revival device, the kid is a *kid*. A mind-controlled kid with some serious Captain America specs. If Fuller hasn’t noticed and your friend defects, he’ll stay dead.”

Clara’s tone was a warning. “Sam.”

“What?” Sam groaned. “Do you want me to sugarcoat it? Tell her the Castor boy is perfectly fine, and it's all rainbows and fuckin’ sunshine?”

The ground suddenly felt strange, like I was walking on air. 

“I promised him,” I managed to choke out. “I… I promised him I wouldn’t let him become one of those things. I said we were going to get out of here. All three of us.”

*“He is… valuable to us.”*

Bobby’s voice sliced through me.

Her body was rattling on the ground, and she was spitting blood. 

When I rolled her onto her back, her expression was blank, but her eyes were open. 

The eyes I’d fallen in love with.

I lurched back, her flickering gaze lazily followed mine.

*“Hand yourself in.”* Bobby’s tone was exactly like Nick’s, drained of everything I loved about her.

“It’s okay.” Clara’s voice was soft. “She’s defecting. She’s not a threat.”

“So, wait, is that like some kind of telepathy shit?” Sam’s eyes snapped to me. “How did she do that?” 

“Bobby.” I knelt next to her. “It’s… it’s going to be okay.” I expected tears to come, but they didn’t.

I pressed a kiss to her forehead, catching Clara’s eye. “You spoke of a mainland. Can you get us there?”

She nodded. “Sam and I have been living on the mainland. Every year we come back and try to save as many as possible, then smuggle them back home.”

“How many?” I held her gaze, but she refused to meet my eyes.

“Twelve. Including you.”

“Only twelve?”

Sam’s laugh was harsh. “We only got two last year. 2017 and 2018 were our best. We saved as many as we could, but those bastards always win.”

“Just you two?”

Clara hummed. “Our first mistake was trusting people.”

“Yeah.” Sam ran a hand through his hair. “Waking up washed up on a beach with a rapidly mending hole in my forehead and seaweed in my mouth taught us that. 

""Strangers, no matter how nice they seem, will fucking kill you. We have to be careful on the mainland. One mention of Aceville gets you a frontal lobotomy or your ass tied to a chair and tortured.”

Sam’s words were bouncing around my skull, but I wasn’t registering them. I was already thinking about Nick. He was still in that building.

“Give me an hour,” I said, my tongue in ties. “I’ll get Nick, and you’ll save them, right? Both of them.”

Clara’s expression was sympathetic. “If his device has been taken out and he’s defecting…”

I didn’t want to hear it. “He’s my best friend. He’s still alive, and they’re not going to let him die. They need him.” I choked. “We can save him. Outside Aceville.""

Sam scowled, but after a moment, his expression softened. “Jessica Hart,” he murmured. “2018. She was processed, but we managed to save her. Pure determination, man. I’d never seen anything like it. That girl’s grip on her own mind was steely.”

“If there’s a chance that part of your friend held on, and they haven’t thrown him in the incinerator already…” He sent me a look. “It’s a shot in the dark, but is it really worth it? What if your friend’s body is down there, or they’ve chopped him up…”

“Sam!” Clara squeaked. “Inside voice!”

“Yes.” I spoke without thinking. “He’s still in there. I know he is.”

Sam looked skeptical before sighing. “Fine. One hour.” He nodded to Clara. “Go with her. I’ll look after the defecting blondie.”

“You’re not immortal,” he said when they hugged. 

I wanted that. I wanted Nick’s arms around me, his fingers tangled in mine. I just wanted my best friend. I wanted him, and I wanted Bobby back by my side.

“They can’t kill you,” Sam pulled something from his jacket and pressed it into her hand. “Point and shoot. Even if you’re a lousy shot.” He offered her a grin, and she rolled her eyes, shoving him.

“Shut up.”

Clara grabbed and squeezed my hand, and before I knew it, she was dragging me back to the clearing, back to where Nick was either dead or alive. I already knew what I was going to do when I found Fuller.

Clara held my arm tightly, her fingernails digging into my skin.

I trusted her steps, her murmured reassurances. She was surprisingly good with the gun, taking out the two guards at the front of the facility at point-blank range without hesitation.

After shooting the guards outside, she grabbed my arm again, keeping a steely grip, and dragged me through the entrance. 

To my surprise, the corridors were empty. Stuffing her pistol down the waistband of her pants, Clara led me down the hallway, moving with slow, cautious steps. I stayed quiet as we climbed the stairs.

I kept having flashbacks to the night before, when I had lost Nick. 

When he had been dragged away, and I couldn’t save him. His words were still rumbling in the back of my mind, echoing in my skull: “Don’t let me become a white picket fence freak,” he had gasped.

“Promise me, Addie!”

And I had promised him.

I had promised him with my last breaths under the stars, waiting for my heart to stop. I had promised him when he had been dragged away to be reprogrammed. Just thinking about him, about my best friend, about saving his mind, made me stagger, struggling to keep up with Clara. 

When we reached the second floor, she stopped at a door and pressed her face against it. 

It felt strange. The last time I had been on this corridor, my filthy feet had pressed against perfect marble flooring, my breath thin, barely fluttering through my lips, and pain. I had been in so much pain, the kind that made me want to die.

Now, all of that was gone. And I craved it. I craved the desperation that had made me feel alive in the first place. Instead, I was numb. Dead flesh.

“If Fuller’s going ahead with Nick’s programming, he should be in one of the rooms downstairs.” Clara pushed the handle down and the door opened. 

“First, though, we’re going to make a quick detour.”

The way she held the handle, knuckles white around the silver steel, told me that whatever was in that room, it meant something to her. 

Meant something to Sam.

“What’s in there?” I asked.

Clara frowned, her lip curling slightly. “Addie, if it’s too much—”

“No,” I said. “I’m okay.”

She shot me a look, the kind Mom gave me when I bought a Sabrina the Teenage Witch comic in eighth grade. Disapproving.

Clara was five years older than me, and she was already like the big sister I had never had.

The room we stepped into wasn’t a programming room. I would have recognized the machines Nick had talked about, the ones I had seen before, blades, saws, knives tainted red. I will never get that image out of my head.

Inside this room, though, what I saw was worse. Clara moved toward a pile on the pristine white floor. As I followed, I realized it wasn’t clothes she was looking at.

They were bodies, my classmates, piled on top of each other. Purple and blue rings stained their shirts, and their gray, lifeless faces stared up with eyes frozen wide in horror. Blood spattered across them, deep red that had long since dried to a dark, crusted brown.

For a moment, I couldn’t move. My mind was trapped, replaying the scene, watching them fall one by one, shot right in front of me.

But I didn’t scream. I didn’t cry. I just stood there, waiting for pain that never came.

Clara moved among them like a frantic insect until she finally straightened up. Her expression broke into a smile I couldn’t understand. Why did she look so hopeful when all I could see was red?

“They’re okay,” she gasped. Maybe she was crying or trying to. It was hard to tell. She pointed to each body as if she recognized them, but she didn’t. Clara didn’t know Elodie McIntire or Tommy Chambers.

I tried to see them as they once were, as people, as friends, but I couldn’t. Something was wrong. Something was off.

Before I could take it all in, Clara’s hands were on my shoulders, gently pushing me back. I knew what I was doing. I was looking for Nick. I was always looking for him, even when I didn’t want to find him.

But it wasn’t Nick. It wasn’t Nick, and I should have felt relieved. I should have been glad.

“Addie,” Clara whispered. “Hey, don’t look, okay? It’s better if you don’t look.”

But I couldn’t not look. I couldn’t not see that pieces of them were missing, like incomplete jigsaw puzzles. Clara was laughing. I think she was. Her smile lit up her face, but her eyes were far too haunted for me to believe it.

“They still have their zeros! Addie, they’re going to be okay. They’re going to reboot.”

I swallowed thickly, forcing my gaze away from the piles of bodies, from Tommy and Elodie.

“They’re freshly dead,” Clara explained. “When we get Nick, we’re bringing them too. We can save so many.” She checked the backs of their necks. “Their zeros are still installed and active. They’re going to be okay.”

She kept saying it.

They’re going to be okay.

I wanted to ask how that was possible, when they had been hacked apart, when legs and arms were missing, skin cruelly stitched back together. 

But I couldn’t help feeling the slightest tinge of hope when looking at Clara right then.

“Sam is going to be ecstatic,” she whispered, grasping my arm for dear life. 

In that moment, she was my anchor, keeping me stable, keeping me afloat. 

I wouldn’t think about Nick or the gruesome scene in front of me twisting my gut into knots.

“Every year he blames himself when we can’t rescue as many kids as possible.”

Clara’s gaze dropped to the ground, her voice splintering.

“He goes into this state where he just sits there staring into space. None of us can get him out of it. When we first started saving kids, and ultimately losing them, he said it’s cruel. The zeros are cruel.” 

“He said he would rather cut his out than pretend to breathe. But I won’t let him. I know it’s awful to try to force someone to live when they’re not really living, when all they want to do is just end it. Maybe I’m selfish, but I can’t do this without him.""

She shrugged. ""He’s been with me for the past five years, and I can’t imagine a morning or night without his whiny ass.”

“Is he…?” I swallowed the rest of my words.

“No,” she said, but I could tell by the pinch between her brows that I was right.

I should have seen it in his expression, in his sardonic attitude and scowl. 

Clara sighed. “He’s just tired of us losing. Every year, fifty seniors get on that bus, and we end up with only two or three if we’re lucky. Last year was the worst.""

""We lost the entire class, Addie. It nearly drove him over the edge. The thing is, we can’t smoke or drink. Well, we can, but it doesn’t affect us. We can’t taste cigarettes, feel the buzz from alcohol, or experience the euphoria of climax of sex. It feels of nothing.""

I pulled a face, and she surprised me with a laugh.

""We’re not robots!” 

Her expression sobered. “I mean, not *that* kind.” 

Clara grabbed my hands, entangling her fingers with mine. “What do you feel?”

Nothing. 

But I didn't say that. 

As if reading my mind, the girl offered a small smile. “You're already thinking like a soldier. You want to say my hand is clammy and my temperature is fluctuating. You can sense every nerve ending, and, if you push hard enough, you can read my thoughts.” She let go, immediately, and that connection crumbled. I was cold again. 

“Everything humans have to take the ache away, even if it’s just temporary, we don’t have that. We just pretend we do. Even our pain is superficial.” 

Clara’s gaze flicked to the defects. “I know it doesn’t seem like much. But to Sam, it’s everything. That scar on his face? Yeah, he did that. When we lost all those kids, he tried to hurt himself.”

Her words whirled around my mind as I tried to register them, trying to understand that Sam didn’t want to pretend to live anymore. And if he felt like that, would that thought ever cross my mind too? 

Would pretending to live without real feelings drive me crazy?

Something caught my eye, pulling me from my thoughts. 

There was movement on the other side of the room, and I couldn’t help myself.

I stumbled to a metal table where a body lay under harsh white light.

For around 6 months I've been having on and off nausea, can get pretty severe but I haven't vomited. This started after I got norovirus and threw up but that was the only time I've ever vomited.

I visited a gastroenterologist and she said it's acid reflux, I had an endoscopy done and nothing came up. Antacids did not help. 

Past week the nausea has been near constant, maybe related but I think I caught a stomach bug because I've had diarrhea and low appetite and lost a lot of weight (also what doctor said when I went yesterday). Besides the nausea I'm also feeling lethargic I think the word is, my short term memory and focus is terrible to the point that I feel like I'm weaving back and forth between consciousness.

I was only prescribed zofran and was told to just rest it off but the symptoms are not letting off.

Also some other information, I'm not diagnosed with anxiety but I've been very anxious and stressed because of school (I have 8 classes per semester). I've been sleeping okay. 

The nausea usually sits either at my throat or in my stomach, and gets really bad when I'm trying on clothes (I think the walking back and forth and looking in mirrors might be doing something) and when I drink matcha (coffee does not do this). This is really odd and I was wondering if maybe I have like a brain tumor or something.

1ocp2cv,https://i.redd.it/qf3d4znqtiwf1.jpeg,Circling the World by Rail: The Geometry of Distance,"# Circling the World by Rail: The Geometry of Distance

I only went around the world once, but it took five train trips to do it.

# 1997 – The Trans-Siberian Railway: Moscow to Beijing

In 1997, my dad, brother, and I boarded the Trans-Siberian Railway, the route that cuts through Mongolia to China instead of heading east to Vladivostok. It was a different era — no smartphones, no Wi-Fi, no way to contact anyone except by postcard or accident. It was the last capture of an old-fashioned time dilation — being truly alone with your thoughts, a notebook, and a Sony Walkman with pirated Russian tapes.

The journey took seven days and 9,001 kilometers across Russia. Sharing a compartment that small with family at an age where everyone has opinions was an exercise in diplomacy and patience. But we made it work, often with spectacular results.

In Siberia, the train stopped in the middle of an uncontrolled forest fire. The smoke seeped in through the vents, and outside the flames were close enough to feel. We were surrounded — the world had turned orange. No panic, no drama — just silence. Russians don’t show fear unless it’s useful.

Crossing into Mongolia, the landscape flattened into the Gobi Desert — bare, open, and infinite. The sand formed shapes that looked like giant marshmallows melting in the sun. Kids waved from the tracks; sometimes they threw bottles. Camels stood outside the grimy restaurant car window. It was the most remote I’ve ever been — the coordinates of total loneliness.

When we entered China, everything changed. Beijing in the late ’90s was bicycles, coal smoke, and momentum. You could still find quiet alleys that hadn’t changed in centuries. Twenty years later, those rivers of bicycles became torrents of e-bikes.

# 2000 – Canada: Halifax to Vancouver

Three years later, I crossed Canada from Halifax to Vancouver by rail. For a country this young and underpopulated, the sheer distance feels like an act of faith. It’s one long, slow-motion sentence of land — Quebec’s rivers, Ontario’s lakes, the Prairies’ flat truth, and the Rockies, which stand like a punctuation mark before the Pacific.

No fires this time, just the quiet realization that most of Canada is trees, water, and rock, held together by the same rails that built it.

# 2003 – USA: New York to San Francisco

In 2003, I rode from New York to San Francisco, two years after 9/11. At the World Trade Center site, people stood behind fencing, staring, whispering, not sure whether to grieve or take photos.

Times Square felt less like a place than a broadcast — noise, neon, and insomnia. Crossing Central Park, I realized that New York doesn’t sleep because it can’t.  

The American rail system isn’t built for speed. It’s slow, rough, and often late. But that’s its charm. The ride across the Appalachians, the Great Plains, and the Sierra Nevada is a front-row seat to the size and contradiction of the country. You pass rusting steel towns, desert towns, thriving cities, and places that have simply given up.

In Europe and Asia, high-speed trains hit 300 km/h and run smoother than governments. In North America, rail is nostalgia. It’s for people who like to take the long way — and don’t mind a stranger buying them coffee in the dining car.

# 2006 – China to North Korea

In 2006, I took the train from China into North Korea and spent a week inside what is still the world’s only dynastic, family-run communist dictatorship. The border crossing was slow, serious, and tense. Guards checked everything.

Each of us had a government minder and a van. Every minute of every day was accounted for. But cracks appeared — moments of improvisation: dancing with North Koreans, laughing, taking a photo when we shouldn’t have. All technically offenses.

It was both terrifying and enlightening. You don’t come back with souvenirs — you come back with perspective.

# 2009 – Moscow to London

The last leg came in 2009: Moscow to London, through Belarus, Ukraine, Poland, Germany, France, and England. This was less about endurance and more about precision — the European trains were fast, clean, and proud of it.

In Berlin, I saw the Brandenburg Gate, Checkpoint Charlie, and the line where history literally changed tracks. In Paris, I bought a baguette and stared at that tower, realizing that some clichés survive because they earn it.

In Germany, the trains ran like clockwork. In France, the TGV was a blur at 300 km/h. Crossing the Channel Tunnel — “Le Ditch,” as the French joke — I sat beneath thirty kilometers of seawater, wondering if civilization was always just one engineering project away from hubris.

When I reached London, the circle was complete — not just geographically, but in perspective. My life had patience again. The days became stories, and time, when given room, showed me what it looks like when it slows down enough to reveal its own face.

# Reflections

From Siberia’s fire to North Korea’s silence, from the Rockies to the Channel Tunnel, each trip showed me how the world fits together when you stop rushing through it.

Planes skip the in-between. Trains teach you to notice it. (There's a Country song, call ""[Fly-Over States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1GZzucDMlQ)"" that epitomizes this.)

My notebooks filled with faces, accents, and toasts — the kind that used to happen between strangers before the screens came out. It’s hard to drink vodka with a stranger now; everyone’s too busy scrolling so they get left alone.

Traveling by rail isn’t about getting somewhere. It’s about sequence — watching one world turn into another, slowly enough to understand it.

Five trips. One loop around the planet.

It took twelve years and about 40,000 miles — but mostly, it took time.  
And that’s the only ticket you can’t buy twice.

1ocp26n,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1ocp26n/the_storm_of_words/,The Storm of Words,"I got it copyrighted: is it worth it?
Chapter 1: The Cliffs of Morning
The gulls cried before the church bells rang, their wings flashing white against the rising sun. From the window of her family’s cottage, Élodie could see the sea stretching out like a sheet of hammered silver. The chalk cliffs of Le Tréport glowed pale and ghostly, as if carved from the bones of giants.
She pulled her shawl tighter and stepped outside. The air smelled of salt and tar, of nets drying on the quay. Her father was already at the harbor, mending a line, his hands roughened by years of hauling in the sea’s reluctant gifts.
“Élodie!” he called, without looking up. “Fetch the basket. The tide’s been kind this morning.”
She obeyed, though her eyes lingered on the horizon. Out there, beyond the waves, lay England. She had never seen it, but she had heard the stories—of ladies in wide hats who came on the new trains, of men who spoke French with a strange, clipped accent. Sometimes, when the wind was right, she imagined she could hear their voices carried across the Channel.
The town was waking slowly. Fishermen shouted greetings across the quay, their words carried by the wind. Children ran barefoot along the cobbles, chasing after gulls. The church bell tolled, and the sound mingled with the crash of waves against the breakwater.
Élodie’s mother appeared at the doorway, her apron already dusted with flour. “Don’t dawdle, girl. The market won’t wait for us.”
“Yes, Maman,” Élodie replied, though her gaze still clung to the horizon.
Chapter 2: The English Visitors
By afternoon, the town was transformed. The train from Paris had arrived, bringing with it not only Parisians but also English tourists who had crossed the Channel. They spilled onto the promenade in bright clothes, parasols bobbing like flowers in the sea breeze.
Élodie had never seen such finery. She and her mother stood behind their stall of fish and mussels, watching as the visitors strolled past. Some paused to buy oysters, their French halting but polite. Others pointed at the cliffs, marvelling at their height.
One young Englishman lingered at their stall. He was tall, with sandy hair and a notebook tucked under his arm. “How much?” he asked, pointing at the mussels.
Élodie’s mother named a price, and he nodded, fumbling with coins. His accent was strange, but his smile was warm.
“You write?” Élodie asked, surprising herself.
The young man looked startled, then laughed. “Yes. I write… stories. About the sea, about places like this.”
She blushed, suddenly aware of the roughness of her hands compared to his clean, ink stained fingers.
“Perhaps one day,” he said, “you will read them.”
And with that, he was gone, swallowed by the crowd of visitors.
That night, as Élodie lay in bed, she thought of him—not his face so much as the idea of him, a man who could take the sea and turn it into words. She wondered if her own life, bound to the tides of Le Tréport, could ever be written into a story.
Chapter 3: The Storm
The storm came without warning. One moment the sky was clear, the next it was split by lightning. The wind howled through the streets, tearing at shutters and slamming doors. The sea rose in fury, waves crashing against the breakwater with a force that shook the ground.
Élodie stood at the window, her heart pounding. Her brother, Luc, was out at sea with the other fishermen. She could see their boats tossed like toys on the waves, their lanterns flickering in the darkness.
Her mother prayed aloud, clutching her rosary. Her father paced the room, his face pale. “The tide’s too strong,” he muttered. “They’ll never make it back.”
Hours passed. The storm raged on, relentless. At last, a few boats staggered into the harbour, their sails torn, their hulls battered. Men stumbled ashore, soaked and shivering. But Luc’s boat did not return.
When dawn broke, the sea was calm again, as if nothing had happened. But the town was silent, mourning the men who had been lost. Élodie walked along the beach, her feet sinking into the wet sand. She found a piece of Luc’s net tangled in the rocks, and she held it to her chest, tears streaming down her face.
The sea had taken her brother, and there was nothing she could do.
Chapter 4: The Lighthouse Keeper
In the days that followed, Élodie found herself drawn to the lighthouse. Old Monsieur Lefèvre welcomed her with a solemn nod.
“The sea is cruel,” he said, his voice rough as gravel. “But she is also honest. She gives warnings, if you know how to read them.”
He showed her the logbooks he kept, filled with notes about tides, winds, and storms. He told her stories of shipwrecks and rescues, of sailors who had vanished and others who had been saved.
“Your brother was brave,” he said. “Braver than most. The sea took him, but it will not take his memory.”
Élodie listened, her grief tempered by the old man’s words. She began to see the sea not only as an enemy but as a force of nature, vast and indifferent. It could not be tamed, but it could be understood.
One evening, as the sun set behind the cliffs, Monsieur Lefèvre handed her a small notebook. “Write,” he said. “Write your brother’s story. Write the story of this town. The sea will not remember, but you can.”
Élodie held the notebook in her hands, its pages blank and waiting. For the first time since the storm, she felt a spark of hope.
Chapter 5: Whispers of War
Years passed. The town healed, though the memory of the storm lingered. Élodie grew into a young woman, her hair dark as the sea at night, her eyes bright with determination. She continued to write, filling notebook after notebook with stories of Le Tréport.
But in 1914, whispers of war reached the town. Men spoke in hushed voices at the harbour, reading newspapers with grim headlines. Soldiers marched through the streets, their boots echoing on the cobblestones.
Le Tréport became a hospital town. British soldiers arrived, wounded from the front. The hotels and seaside villas were turned into makeshift wards. The promenade, once filled with tourists, now echoed with the groans of the injured.
Élodie volunteered to help. She carried water, washed linens, and sat with the soldiers who could not sleep. Many of them spoke little French, but she remembered the Englishman with the notebook, and she tried to bridge the gap with gestures and smiles.
One evening, a young soldier pressed a letter into her hands. “For my mother,” he said, his voice weak. “But… I cannot write French.”
Élodie read the letter, her heart aching at the words. She translated it carefully, her pen scratching across the page. When she handed it back, the soldier’s eyes filled with tears.
“You are kind,” he whispered.
And in that moment, Élodie realised that her gift for words could do more than preserve memories. It could bring comfort, even across languages and borders.
Chapter 6: Letters Across the Channel
The war dragged on, and with it came more soldiers, more letters, more grief. Élodie became known as la fille aux lettres— the girl of the letters. She wrote for mothers and fathers, for wives and sweethearts. She wrote of longing and fear, of promises to return.
Sometimes she knew the promises would not be kept. She saw it in the eyes of the doctors, in the way the nurses shook their heads. Yet she wrote them anyway, because hope was as necessary as bread.
At night, she sat by her window with her own notebook, listening to the waves. She wrote not only for others but for herself — stories of the town, of the sea, of Luc. She wrote of the Englishman she had once met at the market, the one with the sandy hair and the notebook. She wondered if he was somewhere in the trenches, scribbling words in the mud.
One evening, as she finished a letter for a soldier too weak to hold a pen, he whispered, “When I am gone, will you remember me?”
Élodie pressed his hand gently. “Yes,” she said. “I will write your story.”
And she did.
Chapter 7: The Return of the Sea
The war ended in 1918, but its echoes lingered. The seaside villas stood shuttered, the promenade empty. Slowly, life returned. By the early 1920s, trains once again brought visitors from Paris and across the Channel. Families strolled the promenade, children licked ice creams, and the sound of laughter mingled once more with the cries of gulls.
Élodie, now in her late twenties, carried her notebooks everywhere. She had written so many letters for others that she had discovered her own voice. She began to write stories of resilience — of fishermen who braved the tides, of women who kept the town alive while the men were gone, of children who grew up too quickly.
She married Henri, a fisherman who had survived the trenches. He was quiet, his eyes shadowed by memories he rarely spoke of, but his hands were steady and kind. Together they built a small home near the harbor. Their children, Jacques and Marianne, grew up with the sea as their playground.
On summer evenings, the family sat on the promenade, watching the sun sink into the horizon. The war felt far away then, though never forgotten.
Chapter 8: Shadows of Change
The 1930s brought both promise and unease. Tourism flourished again; English families returned to the beaches, their laughter echoing across the Channel. The funicular railway carried visitors up the cliffs, offering sweeping views of the sea. Le Tréport seemed alive with color and sound.
But beneath the gaiety, shadows lengthened. The newspapers spoke of economic collapse, of unrest in Germany, of a man named Hitler rising to power. In the cafés, fishermen and shopkeepers argued in low voices, their brows furrowed.
Élodie, now in her forties, felt the tension in the air. She remembered too well the way whispers had grown into thunder in 1914. She watched her children grow — Jacques tall and restless, Marianne thoughtful and sharp — and wondered what kind of world awaited them.
One evening, as they walked along the cliffs, Jacques asked, “Maman, will there be another war?”
Élodie hesitated. The sea stretched before them, vast and indifferent. “I hope not,” she said softly. “But if there is, we will endure. Just as we always have.”
Chapter 9: Shadows on the Cliffs
When German troops marched into Le Tréport in 1940, the sound of their boots on the cobblestones was heavier, more menacing than the French soldiers she had once seen off at the station.
The seaside town became a place of occupation. The promenade was lined with barbed wire, the lighthouse commandeered by German officers. The cafés whispered with fear.
But beneath the surface, resistance stirred. Messages were passed in loaves of bread, in folded scraps of paper hidden beneath fish baskets. The chalk cliffs, riddled with caves, became secret hiding places; for them and the Bosch. 
Élodie’s children, Jacques and Marianne, grew up in this shadowed world. They learned to keep their voices low, to look away when soldiers passed. Yet they also learned courage. At night, they carried notes tucked into their shoes, slipping them into cracks in the cliffs where Resistance fighters would find them.
The sea, once a place of play and grief, became a silent ally. Its tides carried whispers of freedom, its waves masking the footsteps of those who moved in secret.
Chapter 10: The Hidden Caves
The caves beneath the cliffs were damp and cold, their walls etched with centuries of salt and wind. To the Germans, they were nothing more than natural hollows. To the people of Le Tréport, they were lifelines.
Jacques and Marianne carried messages there at dusk, their hearts pounding as they slipped past patrols. Sometimes the notes contained names, sometimes maps, sometimes only a single word: Demain — tomorrow.
One evening, as Marianne placed a folded scrap into a crevice, she whispered, “Do you think they’ll ever know it was us?”
Jacques shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. What matters is that they know.”
Élodie waited for them at home, her candle burning low. When they returned, she kissed their foreheads, pride and fear mingling in her eyes.
The war pressed heavily on the town. Food was scarce, curfews strict. Yet in the hidden caves, hope flickered like a lantern in the dark.
And Élodie, who had once written letters for dying soldiers, now wrote coded messages for the living. Her words, once a comfort, had become weapons.
Chapter 11: Liberation
By the summer of 1944, the air above Le Tréport thundered with Allied planes. The Germans grew nervous, their patrols harsher, their tempers shorter. Yet the townsfolk sensed change.
On a September morning, the sound of gunfire echoed from the cliffs. Allied troops advanced, and the Germans began to retreat. The people of Le Tréport poured into the streets, their fear mingled with joy.
Élodie stood with Jacques and Marianne at her side as British soldiers marched into town. The Union Jack was raised alongside the Tricolore, and the bells of the church rang out, not for mourning this time, but for freedom.
Tears streamed down Élodie’s face as she embraced her children. She thought of Luc, of Henri, of the soldiers she had written for, of the countless lives lost. The town was scarred, but it was free.
Chapter 12: The Tide Turns
Years later, Élodie, now an old woman, sat on the promenade with her grandchildren. The sea stretched before them, calm and endless. Children played on the beach, their laughter carried by the wind.
She told them stories — of storms and wars, of letters and caves, of courage and loss. She told them of Luc, of Henri, of the Englishman with the notebook, of the soldiers who had passed through their town.
“The sea does not remember,” she said softly. “But we do. And as long as we tell the stories, they will never be lost.”
The tide rolled in, steady and eternal, carrying with it the memory of all that had been.
Chapter 11: The City of Light
After the Liberation, Élodie found herself restless. Le Tréport had been her cradle, her battlefield, her sanctuary — but she longed for something more. The notebooks she had filled during the wars, first with letters for soldiers and then with coded messages for the Resistance, had become her constant companions.
In 1947, with Jacques beginning his studies and Marianne apprenticed in a local atelier, Élodie boarded a train to Paris. The journey felt like stepping into another world. The countryside rolled past, green and gold, until at last the train pulled into the Gare Saint Lazare.
Paris overwhelmed her at first. The boulevards stretched wide and elegant, lined with chestnut trees. Cafés spilled onto the sidewalks, their tables crowded with students, artists, and philosophers arguing over cups of black coffee. The Seine shimmered beneath its bridges, barges gliding slowly past. Notre Dame rose like a stone sentinel, its bells echoing across the Île de la Cité.
Élodie walked the streets with wide eyes, her notebook clutched to her chest. She had come to study languages at the Sorbonne, but more than that, she had come to find her voice.
Chapter 12: The Sorbonne Years
The Sorbonne was a world of its own. Its lecture halls smelled of chalk and ink, its walls lined with centuries of scholarship. Students hurried through the courtyards with books under their arms, their voices a chorus of French, English, German, and Latin.
Élodie, older than many of her classmates, felt out of place at first. But her years of translating letters and writing stories had given her a gift: she understood language not only as grammar and vocabulary, but as a bridge between souls. Professors noticed her insight, and soon she was invited to teach.
Standing at the lectern, she spoke of the power of words — how they could comfort the dying, inspire the living, and resist oppression. Her students listened, rapt, as she told them of Le Tréport, of the storm that had taken her brother, of the letters she had written for soldiers, of the coded notes hidden in the cliffs.
Paris became her home. She lived in a modest apartment near the Jardin du Luxembourg, where she walked each morning beneath the chestnut trees. She spent evenings in cafés, scribbling in her notebooks as the city hummed around her. She visited bookshops along the Seine, their shelves heavy with volumes in every language.
And slowly, she began to think of herself not only as a teacher, but as a writer.
Chapter 13: The Author
In the 1960s, Élodie published her first book: Les Lettres de la Mer — Letters of the Sea. It was part memoir, part fiction, weaving together the voices of fishermen, soldiers, and children who had lived and died by the tides of Le Tréport. The book was praised for its honesty, its lyricism, its ability to capture both the cruelty and the beauty of the sea.
More books followed: The Hidden Caves, a novel inspired by the Resistance; The Cliffs of Morning, a collection of stories about her childhood; and The Tide Turns, a reflection on memory and survival. Her works were translated into English, German, and Italian. She traveled to London, to Rome, to Berlin, speaking of the power of words to heal and to connect.
Yet no matter how far she went, she always returned to Le Tréport in the summers. She would sit on the promenade, watching the waves, her grandchildren playing in the sand. The sea that had once taken so much from her had also given her everything: her stories, her voice, her purpose.
Chapter 14: The Last Tide
By the 1970s, Élodie was a respected professor at the Sorbonne and a celebrated author. Yet she remained humble, her heart anchored to the cliffs and tides of her childhood.
In 1976, as autumn leaves fell across Paris, she grew ill. From her apartment window, she could see the rooftops of the Latin Quarter, the dome of the Panthéon rising above them. She asked her children to bring her notebooks, and she wrote until her hand could no longer hold the pen.
Her final words were not of war or sorrow, but of the sea. She wrote of its endless rhythm, its power to take and to give, its indifference and its beauty.
When she passed, her family brought her back to Le Tréport. The church bells tolled, the gulls cried, and the tide rolled in, steady and eternal.
On her gravestone, they carved the words she had once spoken to her grandchildren:
“The sea does not remember. But we do.”
Epilogue: The Last Word
Élodie’s life stretched across nearly a century of storms and calm, of wars and peace, of silence and words. She had been a fisherman’s daughter, a grieving sister, a translator of hope, a mother, a professor, and finally an author whose books carried her voice far beyond the cliffs of her childhood.
She died in 1976, her notebooks filled, her legacy secure. At her funeral in Le Tréport, the church bells tolled as they had so many times before — for storms, for wars, for liberation — but this time they rang for her. The townsfolk remembered her as the girl who had written letters for soldiers, the woman who had hidden messages in the caves, the professor who had taught that words could resist forgetting.
Her children and grandchildren stood by the sea as the tide rolled in, steady and eternal. They read aloud the words carved on her gravestone:
“The sea does not remember. But we do.”
And so, they did.

Ate bbq today and hit the gym and the pressure was absolutely awful. The weird thing the only symptom I have now is ear pressure and occasional wheezing when I lay down.  I have asthma and will wheeze when I am laying down for a bit. I am not sold its LPR but not sure what else it could be. Also its much worse standing than laying down where it seems to go away.  Any help or feedback is greatly appreciated. ,2,1761080713.0,LPR,1,1.0,False
1ocp1gb,https://www.reddit.com/r/taos/comments/1ocp1gb/plaza_parking/,Plaza Parking,"Just received my first plaza parking ticket to the tune of $25 + $3 ""convenience"" fee to pay it (lol). Taos currently offers an annual parking pass for $100 for 2 plates plus $21 ""processing"" fee. 

So here's the deal: I live here. I take my kid to Twirl and buy toys. I eat at the Alley Cantina. I buy coffee at World Cup. When people come to visit me I take them to the plaza and John Dunn shops so they can buy a t-shirt and hat with Taos printed on it. I am happy and willing to spend money into local businesses here but I am absolutely not going to pay for the privilege to do so. I guess that means I don't go to the plaza anymore. For a town struggling to build up the local economy after Covid and intensive road work this place sure knows how to shoot itself in the foot. 

When paid parking was introduced I assumed it was a gimmick to squeeze some extra bucks out of tourists passing through (sure, why not?) but asking locals to pay to park in order to access local business is bullshit and poorly thought out planning by the town. If anything just send the meter maid out to pop out of state plates.

Please be aware that Brett Dadig is on his way back to Pittsburgh for the unforeseeable future. For those of you who don’t know Brett he is someone who habitually stalks and harasses women, and he has violated restraining/trespassing orders in the past. He also has more serious accusations of choking and s*xual assault (according to himself, my source for this is literally his own podcast where he talks about these incidents). He has been hopping from city to city in efforts of starting fresh/flying under the radar but Pittsburgh is his home base and it is where he always flocks back to when he’s ran himself out of the latest city. He has slightly changed his appearance by shaving off his mustache. Please steer clear of this man as he is on the fast track to becoming infamous. If you want to find him, he is incredibly active (to his own fault) on social media (Instagram/tiktok). Just type in his name and his account should come up. There are other Reddit threads on Brett but he does tend to report posts that paint him in a negative light so I hope this reaches enough people before it gets taken down or reported.

He also recently posted on his *public* Instagram story his psych diagnoses (on discharge paper work, likely from either an emergency department of a hospital or a mental health facility) which states he has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and antisocial personality disorder with psychotic tendencies. I don’t want to attach a negative stigma to these diagnoses but it is imperative to know that this is not someone who is in their “right mind” and he very obviously doesn’t take care of his mental health. He leans VERY heavily on the idealism of God always having his back so he can do no wrong - a trait that is very scary in someone who has these diagnoses and the track record he has. He frequents coffee shops, bars and private gyms. He often tries to meet women under the guise of being a successful self-made entrepreneur - he even has fake Instagram accounts promoting his fake businesses. Endorses himself as upper echelon, also leans heavily on the finance bro-adjacent personality, which he believes is what women are looking for. He has an unfathomably inflated sense of self and when he is rejected he reacts in extreme fashion but one thing is for sure, he will ALWAYS take it to social media. The scariest part about him is that he looks like any other “normal” looking guy. ",31,1761080658.0,TwoXChromosomes,0,1.0,False

1ocozte,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1ocozte/i_want_him_to_try/,I want him to try.,"I’m honestly so sick of my boyfriend and everything about this relationship lately. I’m 21F and he’s 22M (we have been together for a year), and it feels like I’m taking care of a grown man who refuses to act like one. He showers maybe twice a week same with brushing his teeth, sometimes less, and it’s gotten to the point where I literally don’t even want to be near him. It’s gross. I’ve brought it up gently, I’ve asked him nicely, I’ve straight-up told him it’s nasty, but nothing changes. We live together, we share a bed, a house, a dog — and it’s like he doesn’t care at all about hygiene or effort anymore. 

I pay for everything. Groceries, gas, coffee every morning, random takeout, every single vet bill for our dog, everything. He doesn’t even have a car, so I’m the one driving everywhere and covering all the expenses. It’s exhausting. He works with me sometimes when I need an extra hand for my business, but it’s inconsistent, and honestly I only pay him partially because I’m already the one keeping both of us afloat. And somehow he still acts like I’m stingy for not paying him “properly” — like, are you kidding me? I’m paying for both of our lives!

When he does have money, he never contributes. Ever. He doesn’t offer to pay for groceries, doesn’t fill the gas tank, doesn’t take me out — nothing. The only thing he spends money on is video games. That’s it. New games, new add-ons, new accessories — whatever. I come home after a long day, and he’s sitting there, headset on, completely zoned out, playing for hours. The dishes are still in the sink, the dog hasn’t been walked, the house is a mess, and he’s yelling into his mic like a teenager. I feel like I’m living with a roommate who contributes nothing except noise and dirty laundry.

And lately, there’s this weird gym thing that’s been driving me crazy. He’s started going to the gym with his buddy, which at first I thought was great — maybe he’s finally doing something productive. But then I noticed this weird pattern. Some days they go straight in and start their workout right away, but other days he just doesn’t answer my texts for an hour or more. Then, out of nowhere, he’ll message me saying, “Just starting my workout.” So I asked him what he’s been doing that whole time, sitting there in the parking lot for an hour. His answer? “I was drinking my Monster.” Like seriously? You were sitting in a car for an hour just drinking an energy drink? That’s the kind of weird behavior that makes me feel like something’s off. I’m not even saying he’s cheating or anything, it’s just… it’s odd. Why not just say that’s what you’re doing instead of ignoring me completely? It’s the ignoring that bothers me. It feels disrespectful. 

But every time I try to talk to him about anything — hygiene, money, effort, communication, whatever — he immediately gets defensive. He tells me to “shut up,” “fuck off,” or calls me “bossy.” Like I’m supposed to just stay quiet and keep paying for his entire life while he sits around doing nothing. I’m not being controlling, I’m just asking for basic respect and partnership. I shouldn’t have to beg my boyfriend to shower, to help with bills, or to talk to me like a decent human being.

I’m exhausted. I’m tired of feeling like the only adult here. I’m tired of having to do everything myself — for our dog, our house, our finances, our lives — while he acts like a dependent child who doesn’t care. I used to love him so much, but now I just feel drained and disappointed every single day. It’s like I’m slowly realizing that I don’t even have a partner — I have another responsibility. I feel unappreciated, disrespected, and completely taken for granted.

I’m honestly starting to think I deserve better than this. And I hate that it’s taken me this long to realize that love isn’t enough when you’re the only one trying.

Side note:
What really gets me is that when his friends want to hang out, suddenly he’s a whole new person. He showers, brushes his teeth, puts on deodorant, sprays cologne, and actually tries to look good. He won’t even do that for me. But the second his buddies text him, he’s up and ready like it’s nothing. And whenever I mention anything — like the fact that I pay for everything or that he doesn’t pull his weight — especially in front of other people, he gets all mad and embarrassed, like I’m the one doing something wrong. It’s honestly so frustrating.

Chapter 1: The Cliffs of Morning
The gulls cried before the church bells rang, their wings flashing white against the rising sun. From the window of her family’s cottage, Élodie could see the sea stretching out like a sheet of hammered silver. The chalk cliffs of Le Tréport glowed pale and ghostly, as if carved from the bones of giants.
She pulled her shawl tighter and stepped outside. The air smelled of salt and tar, of nets drying on the quay. Her father was already at the harbor, mending a line, his hands roughened by years of hauling in the sea’s reluctant gifts.
“Élodie!” he called, without looking up. “Fetch the basket. The tide’s been kind this morning.”
She obeyed, though her eyes lingered on the horizon. Out there, beyond the waves, lay England. She had never seen it, but she had heard the stories—of ladies in wide hats who came on the new trains, of men who spoke French with a strange, clipped accent. Sometimes, when the wind was right, she imagined she could hear their voices carried across the Channel.
The town was waking slowly. Fishermen shouted greetings across the quay, their words carried by the wind. Children ran barefoot along the cobbles, chasing after gulls. The church bell tolled, and the sound mingled with the crash of waves against the breakwater.
Élodie’s mother appeared at the doorway, her apron already dusted with flour. “Don’t dawdle, girl. The market won’t wait for us.”
“Yes, Maman,” Élodie replied, though her gaze still clung to the horizon.
Chapter 2: The English Visitors
By afternoon, the town was transformed. The train from Paris had arrived, bringing with it not only Parisians but also English tourists who had crossed the Channel. They spilled onto the promenade in bright clothes, parasols bobbing like flowers in the sea breeze.
Élodie had never seen such finery. She and her mother stood behind their stall of fish and mussels, watching as the visitors strolled past. Some paused to buy oysters, their French halting but polite. Others pointed at the cliffs, marvelling at their height.
One young Englishman lingered at their stall. He was tall, with sandy hair and a notebook tucked under his arm. “How much?” he asked, pointing at the mussels.
Élodie’s mother named a price, and he nodded, fumbling with coins. His accent was strange, but his smile was warm.
“You write?” Élodie asked, surprising herself.
The young man looked startled, then laughed. “Yes. I write… stories. About the sea, about places like this.”
She blushed, suddenly aware of the roughness of her hands compared to his clean, ink stained fingers.
“Perhaps one day,” he said, “you will read them.”
And with that, he was gone, swallowed by the crowd of visitors.
That night, as Élodie lay in bed, she thought of him—not his face so much as the idea of him, a man who could take the sea and turn it into words. She wondered if her own life, bound to the tides of Le Tréport, could ever be written into a story.
Chapter 3: The Storm
The storm came without warning. One moment the sky was clear, the next it was split by lightning. The wind howled through the streets, tearing at shutters and slamming doors. The sea rose in fury, waves crashing against the breakwater with a force that shook the ground.
Élodie stood at the window, her heart pounding. Her brother, Luc, was out at sea with the other fishermen. She could see their boats tossed like toys on the waves, their lanterns flickering in the darkness.
Her mother prayed aloud, clutching her rosary. Her father paced the room, his face pale. “The tide’s too strong,” he muttered. “They’ll never make it back.”
Hours passed. The storm raged on, relentless. At last, a few boats staggered into the harbour, their sails torn, their hulls battered. Men stumbled ashore, soaked and shivering. But Luc’s boat did not return.
When dawn broke, the sea was calm again, as if nothing had happened. But the town was silent, mourning the men who had been lost. Élodie walked along the beach, her feet sinking into the wet sand. She found a piece of Luc’s net tangled in the rocks, and she held it to her chest, tears streaming down her face.
The sea had taken her brother, and there was nothing she could do.
Chapter 4: The Lighthouse Keeper
In the days that followed, Élodie found herself drawn to the lighthouse. Old Monsieur Lefèvre welcomed her with a solemn nod.
“The sea is cruel,” he said, his voice rough as gravel. “But she is also honest. She gives warnings, if you know how to read them.”
He showed her the logbooks he kept, filled with notes about tides, winds, and storms. He told her stories of shipwrecks and rescues, of sailors who had vanished and others who had been saved.
“Your brother was brave,” he said. “Braver than most. The sea took him, but it will not take his memory.”
Élodie listened, her grief tempered by the old man’s words. She began to see the sea not only as an enemy but as a force of nature, vast and indifferent. It could not be tamed, but it could be understood.
One evening, as the sun set behind the cliffs, Monsieur Lefèvre handed her a small notebook. “Write,” he said. “Write your brother’s story. Write the story of this town. The sea will not remember, but you can.”
Élodie held the notebook in her hands, its pages blank and waiting. For the first time since the storm, she felt a spark of hope.
Chapter 5: Whispers of War
Years passed. The town healed, though the memory of the storm lingered. Élodie grew into a young woman, her hair dark as the sea at night, her eyes bright with determination. She continued to write, filling notebook after notebook with stories of Le Tréport.
But in 1914, whispers of war reached the town. Men spoke in hushed voices at the harbour, reading newspapers with grim headlines. Soldiers marched through the streets, their boots echoing on the cobblestones.
Le Tréport became a hospital town. British soldiers arrived, wounded from the front. The hotels and seaside villas were turned into makeshift wards. The promenade, once filled with tourists, now echoed with the groans of the injured.
Élodie volunteered to help. She carried water, washed linens, and sat with the soldiers who could not sleep. Many of them spoke little French, but she remembered the Englishman with the notebook, and she tried to bridge the gap with gestures and smiles.
One evening, a young soldier pressed a letter into her hands. “For my mother,” he said, his voice weak. “But… I cannot write French.”
Élodie read the letter, her heart aching at the words. She translated it carefully, her pen scratching across the page. When she handed it back, the soldier’s eyes filled with tears.
“You are kind,” he whispered.
And in that moment, Élodie realised that her gift for words could do more than preserve memories. It could bring comfort, even across languages and borders.
Chapter 6: Letters Across the Channel
The war dragged on, and with it came more soldiers, more letters, more grief. Élodie became known as la fille aux lettres— the girl of the letters. She wrote for mothers and fathers, for wives and sweethearts. She wrote of longing and fear, of promises to return.
Sometimes she knew the promises would not be kept. She saw it in the eyes of the doctors, in the way the nurses shook their heads. Yet she wrote them anyway, because hope was as necessary as bread.
At night, she sat by her window with her own notebook, listening to the waves. She wrote not only for others but for herself — stories of the town, of the sea, of Luc. She wrote of the Englishman she had once met at the market, the one with the sandy hair and the notebook. She wondered if he was somewhere in the trenches, scribbling words in the mud.
One evening, as she finished a letter for a soldier too weak to hold a pen, he whispered, “When I am gone, will you remember me?”
Élodie pressed his hand gently. “Yes,” she said. “I will write your story.”
And she did.
Chapter 7: The Return of the Sea
The war ended in 1918, but its echoes lingered. The seaside villas stood shuttered, the promenade empty. Slowly, life returned. By the early 1920s, trains once again brought visitors from Paris and across the Channel. Families strolled the promenade, children licked ice creams, and the sound of laughter mingled once more with the cries of gulls.
Élodie, now in her late twenties, carried her notebooks everywhere. She had written so many letters for others that she had discovered her own voice. She began to write stories of resilience — of fishermen who braved the tides, of women who kept the town alive while the men were gone, of children who grew up too quickly.
She married Henri, a fisherman who had survived the trenches. He was quiet, his eyes shadowed by memories he rarely spoke of, but his hands were steady and kind. Together they built a small home near the harbor. Their children, Jacques and Marianne, grew up with the sea as their playground.
On summer evenings, the family sat on the promenade, watching the sun sink into the horizon. The war felt far away then, though never forgotten.
Chapter 8: Shadows of Change
The 1930s brought both promise and unease. Tourism flourished again; English families returned to the beaches, their laughter echoing across the Channel. The funicular railway carried visitors up the cliffs, offering sweeping views of the sea. Le Tréport seemed alive with color and sound.
But beneath the gaiety, shadows lengthened. The newspapers spoke of economic collapse, of unrest in Germany, of a man named Hitler rising to power. In the cafés, fishermen and shopkeepers argued in low voices, their brows furrowed.
Élodie, now in her forties, felt the tension in the air. She remembered too well the way whispers had grown into thunder in 1914. She watched her children grow — Jacques tall and restless, Marianne thoughtful and sharp — and wondered what kind of world awaited them.
One evening, as they walked along the cliffs, Jacques asked, “Maman, will there be another war?”
Élodie hesitated. The sea stretched before them, vast and indifferent. “I hope not,” she said softly. “But if there is, we will endure. Just as we always have.”
Chapter 9: Shadows on the Cliffs
When German troops marched into Le Tréport in 1940, the sound of their boots on the cobblestones was heavier, more menacing than the French soldiers she had once seen off at the station.
The seaside town became a place of occupation. The promenade was lined with barbed wire, the lighthouse commandeered by German officers. The cafés whispered with fear.
But beneath the surface, resistance stirred. Messages were passed in loaves of bread, in folded scraps of paper hidden beneath fish baskets. The chalk cliffs, riddled with caves, became secret hiding places; for them and the Bosch. 
Élodie’s children, Jacques and Marianne, grew up in this shadowed world. They learned to keep their voices low, to look away when soldiers passed. Yet they also learned courage. At night, they carried notes tucked into their shoes, slipping them into cracks in the cliffs where Resistance fighters would find them.
The sea, once a place of play and grief, became a silent ally. Its tides carried whispers of freedom, its waves masking the footsteps of those who moved in secret.
Chapter 10: The Hidden Caves
The caves beneath the cliffs were damp and cold, their walls etched with centuries of salt and wind. To the Germans, they were nothing more than natural hollows. To the people of Le Tréport, they were lifelines.
Jacques and Marianne carried messages there at dusk, their hearts pounding as they slipped past patrols. Sometimes the notes contained names, sometimes maps, sometimes only a single word: Demain — tomorrow.
One evening, as Marianne placed a folded scrap into a crevice, she whispered, “Do you think they’ll ever know it was us?”
Jacques shook his head. “It doesn’t matter. What matters is that they know.”
Élodie waited for them at home, her candle burning low. When they returned, she kissed their foreheads, pride and fear mingling in her eyes.
The war pressed heavily on the town. Food was scarce, curfews strict. Yet in the hidden caves, hope flickered like a lantern in the dark.
And Élodie, who had once written letters for dying soldiers, now wrote coded messages for the living. Her words, once a comfort, had become weapons.
Chapter 11: Liberation
By the summer of 1944, the air above Le Tréport thundered with Allied planes. The Germans grew nervous, their patrols harsher, their tempers shorter. Yet the townsfolk sensed change.
On a September morning, the sound of gunfire echoed from the cliffs. Allied troops advanced, and the Germans began to retreat. The people of Le Tréport poured into the streets, their fear mingled with joy.
Élodie stood with Jacques and Marianne at her side as British soldiers marched into town. The Union Jack was raised alongside the Tricolore, and the bells of the church rang out, not for mourning this time, but for freedom.
Tears streamed down Élodie’s face as she embraced her children. She thought of Luc, of Henri, of the soldiers she had written for, of the countless lives lost. The town was scarred, but it was free.
Chapter 12: The Tide Turns
Years later, Élodie, now an old woman, sat on the promenade with her grandchildren. The sea stretched before them, calm and endless. Children played on the beach, their laughter carried by the wind.
She told them stories — of storms and wars, of letters and caves, of courage and loss. She told them of Luc, of Henri, of the Englishman with the notebook, of the soldiers who had passed through their town.
“The sea does not remember,” she said softly. “But we do. And as long as we tell the stories, they will never be lost.”
The tide rolled in, steady and eternal, carrying with it the memory of all that had been.
Chapter 11: The City of Light
After the Liberation, Élodie found herself restless. Le Tréport had been her cradle, her battlefield, her sanctuary — but she longed for something more. The notebooks she had filled during the wars, first with letters for soldiers and then with coded messages for the Resistance, had become her constant companions.
In 1947, with Jacques beginning his studies and Marianne apprenticed in a local atelier, Élodie boarded a train to Paris. The journey felt like stepping into another world. The countryside rolled past, green and gold, until at last the train pulled into the Gare Saint Lazare.
Paris overwhelmed her at first. The boulevards stretched wide and elegant, lined with chestnut trees. Cafés spilled onto the sidewalks, their tables crowded with students, artists, and philosophers arguing over cups of black coffee. The Seine shimmered beneath its bridges, barges gliding slowly past. Notre Dame rose like a stone sentinel, its bells echoing across the Île de la Cité.
Élodie walked the streets with wide eyes, her notebook clutched to her chest. She had come to study languages at the Sorbonne, but more than that, she had come to find her voice.
Chapter 12: The Sorbonne Years
The Sorbonne was a world of its own. Its lecture halls smelled of chalk and ink, its walls lined with centuries of scholarship. Students hurried through the courtyards with books under their arms, their voices a chorus of French, English, German, and Latin.
Élodie, older than many of her classmates, felt out of place at first. But her years of translating letters and writing stories had given her a gift: she understood language not only as grammar and vocabulary, but as a bridge between souls. Professors noticed her insight, and soon she was invited to teach.
Standing at the lectern, she spoke of the power of words — how they could comfort the dying, inspire the living, and resist oppression. Her students listened, rapt, as she told them of Le Tréport, of the storm that had taken her brother, of the letters she had written for soldiers, of the coded notes hidden in the cliffs.
Paris became her home. She lived in a modest apartment near the Jardin du Luxembourg, where she walked each morning beneath the chestnut trees. She spent evenings in cafés, scribbling in her notebooks as the city hummed around her. She visited bookshops along the Seine, their shelves heavy with volumes in every language.
And slowly, she began to think of herself not only as a teacher, but as a writer.
Chapter 13: The Author
In the 1960s, Élodie published her first book: Les Lettres de la Mer — Letters of the Sea. It was part memoir, part fiction, weaving together the voices of fishermen, soldiers, and children who had lived and died by the tides of Le Tréport. The book was praised for its honesty, its lyricism, its ability to capture both the cruelty and the beauty of the sea.
More books followed: The Hidden Caves, a novel inspired by the Resistance; The Cliffs of Morning, a collection of stories about her childhood; and The Tide Turns, a reflection on memory and survival. Her works were translated into English, German, and Italian. She traveled to London, to Rome, to Berlin, speaking of the power of words to heal and to connect.
Yet no matter how far she went, she always returned to Le Tréport in the summers. She would sit on the promenade, watching the waves, her grandchildren playing in the sand. The sea that had once taken so much from her had also given her everything: her stories, her voice, her purpose.
Chapter 14: The Last Tide
By the 1970s, Élodie was a respected professor at the Sorbonne and a celebrated author. Yet she remained humble, her heart anchored to the cliffs and tides of her childhood.
In 1976, as autumn leaves fell across Paris, she grew ill. From her apartment window, she could see the rooftops of the Latin Quarter, the dome of the Panthéon rising above them. She asked her children to bring her notebooks, and she wrote until her hand could no longer hold the pen.
Her final words were not of war or sorrow, but of the sea. She wrote of its endless rhythm, its power to take and to give, its indifference and its beauty.
When she passed, her family brought her back to Le Tréport. The church bells tolled, the gulls cried, and the tide rolled in, steady and eternal.
On her gravestone, they carved the words she had once spoken to her grandchildren:
“The sea does not remember. But we do.”
Epilogue: The Last Word
Élodie’s life stretched across nearly a century of storms and calm, of wars and peace, of silence and words. She had been a fisherman’s daughter, a grieving sister, a translator of hope, a mother, a professor, and finally an author whose books carried her voice far beyond the cliffs of her childhood.
She died in 1976, her notebooks filled, her legacy secure. At her funeral in Le Tréport, the church bells tolled as they had so many times before — for storms, for wars, for liberation — but this time they rang for her. The townsfolk remembered her as the girl who had written letters for soldiers, the woman who had hidden messages in the caves, the professor who had taught that words could resist forgetting.
Her children and grandchildren stood by the sea as the tide rolled in, steady and eternal. They read aloud the words carved on her gravestone:
“The sea does not remember. But we do.”
And so, they did.

* Rybelsus is FDA-approved to treat type 2 diabetes. While it can cause weight loss, it's not officially approved for that purpose and is sometimes used ""off-label.""
* While Rybelsus can lead to some weight loss and help with diabetes management, injectables like Ozempic and Wegovy are more potent and lead to more significant results.

With all the buzz around weight-loss medications like Ozempic, you might be wondering: Is there an Ozempic pill? The idea of taking a tablet instead of giving yourself a shot might be appealing.

There is an oral version of semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic), but it’s not called Ozempic. The brand name for the pill is Rybelsus.

While Rybelsus and Ozempic share the same active ingredient, there are crucial differences in how each medication is used, how effective they are for weight loss, and what you can expect. If you’re wondering whether an ""oral Ozempic"" could be right for you, here’s a clear, evidence-based look at what you need to know.

# What is Rybelsus, the ""oral Ozempic""?

[Rybelsus](https://www.rybelsus.com/) is a once-daily tablet that contains semaglutide, the same active ingredient found in the weekly injectable medications Ozempic and Wegovy. It belongs to a class of drugs called [glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/diabetes-weight-loss-medications-Ozempic-Wegovy-Mounjaro-Saxenda?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL).

[These medications work](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/how-does-semaglutide-work-wegovy-ozempic?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL) by copying a natural hormone your gut releases after you eat. This hormone tells your brain you're full, slows down how quickly your stomach empties, and helps your pancreas release insulin to manage blood sugar.

The main difference, of course, is that Rybelsus is a pill you take every day, while [Ozempic](https://www.ozempic.com/) and [Wegovy](https://www.wegovy.com/) are injections you take once a week.

Currently, Rybelsus is officially FDA-approved to help manage blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes, alongside diet and exercise. It is not yet approved specifically for weight loss, but because losing weight is a common side effect, some doctors prescribe it ""off-label"" for that purpose.

# How can a pill do what an injection does?

You might be asking yourself how a pill can survive your digestive system to work effectively. Normally, proteins and peptides like semaglutide are destroyed by stomach acid before your body can absorb them.

Rybelsus gets around this with a clever bit of science. The pill includes another ingredient called salcaprozate sodium, or SNAC, which acts as a bodyguard for the semaglutide.

[SNAC does two important jobs](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34024013/):

1. **It protects the semaglutide:** It acts as a buffer, neutralizing stomach acid in the immediate area around the tablet so the medication isn't destroyed.
2. **It helps with absorption:** SNAC makes it easier for the semaglutide to pass through the lining of your stomach and into your bloodstream.

This technology is what makes an oral version of this powerful medication possible, but it’s also the reason for the very specific and strict rules you have to follow when taking it.

# How does weight loss on Rybelsus compare to Ozempic?

While both medications can absolutely help you lose weight, the clinical trial data show a noticeable difference in the results.

Injectable semaglutide (found in Ozempic and Wegovy) generally leads to more significant weight loss. For example, in major clinical trials for Wegovy (a higher-dose version of semaglutide approved for weight loss), participants [lost an average of 15%](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2032183) of their body weight.

The [weight loss from Rybelsus](https://www.drugs.com/medical-answers/rybelsus-ozempic-weight-loss-choose-3578038/) is more modest:

* In one trial, people taking the 14 mg dose of Rybelsus lost an average of about 8 pounds (3.7 kg) over six months.
* Another review showed a weight loss of about 8 to 10 pounds over roughly 30 weeks on the highest dose of Rybelsus, compared to about 10 to 12 pounds with a standard 1 mg dose of Ozempic.

**So, what does this mean in the real world?** For someone who weighs 200 pounds, a 15% weight loss with an injection like Wegovy would be around 30 pounds. An 8-10 pound loss with Rybelsus is still helpful, but it's a very different outcome.

“While Ozempic tends to yield stronger results, a pill can be much more realistic than an injection for some people,” says [Rita Faycurry, RD](https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/rita-faycurry?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL). “It’s all about what works best for the individual.”

It's worth noting that drugmakers are testing higher doses of oral semaglutide (up to 50 mg) for weight loss, and these have shown [results much closer to the injections](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(23)01185-6/abstract), with about 15% body weight loss. The maximum of Ozempic is now 2.4 mg as well. However, these higher doses of Rybelsus are not yet FDA-approved or on the market.

# The rules of Rybelsus

Choosing a pill over a shot might seem like a no-brainer, but Rybelsus isn't a medication you can just take whenever you remember. For it to work, you have to follow a very strict daily routine.

According to the [manufacturer’s guidelines](https://www.novo-pi.com/rybelsus.pdf), you must take Rybelsus:

* **First thing in the morning** on a completely empty stomach.
* **With no more than 4 ounces (about half a glass) of plain water.** No coffee, no juice, no other liquids.
* **At least 30 minutes before** you eat, drink anything else, or take any other oral medications, vitamins, or supplements.
* **Swallowed whole.** The tablet can’t be split, crushed, or chewed.

If you don't follow these rules – for example, if you eat too soon or take it with your morning coffee – the Rybelsus won't be absorbed properly, and you won't get its full effect. 

“This rigid daily routine can be a challenge for some people,” says [Rita Faycurry, RD](https://www.faynutrition.com/dietitians/rita-faycurry?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL). “I encourage patients to weigh it as a crucial trade-off for avoiding a weekly shot.”

# What are the common side effects?

Since Rybelsus and Ozempic share the same active ingredient, they also share similar side effects. The most common ones are gastrointestinal issues, which usually pop up when you first start the medication or when your dose is increased.

[Common side effects](https://www.rybelsus.com/) include:

* Nausea
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Stomach pain
* Constipation
* Decreased appetite

These side effects are often mild to moderate and may get better as your body adjusts. If you're struggling with them, a [registered weight loss dietitian](https://www.faynutrition.com/find-nutritionists/weight-loss?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL) can help you adjust your diet to minimize discomfort while ensuring you get the right nutrition for your goals.

It's also important to be aware of the more serious but rare risks, such as pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and a boxed warning about a potential risk of thyroid C-cell tumors.

# Final thoughts

Choosing between [oral Rybelsus and an injectable semaglutide](https://www.faynutrition.com/post/should-i-take-rybelsus-vs-ozempic?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=21023770447&utm_term=dietitian&pcrit=pnDTHlGL) involves a clear trade-off: the convenience of a daily pill comes with more modest weight loss results (at least at the doses available today) and a very strict set of rules for taking it. The weekly injections, while less convenient for some, have been shown to be more effective for weight loss.

Regardless of which option you and your doctor consider, know that healthy lifestyle changes are always crucial to yield the best results.

On **Sept 11 2025** my doctor (via automated mails) gently said, *“Your blood pressure is 160/88 and your A1C is 6.5 — you’re officially in the danger zone.”*

  
I was basically a walking sodium experiment.  
So, I decided to treat my body like a side project: gather data, test changes, and make it fun instead of doom-scrolling WebMD at 2 AM.

# ⚙️ Phase 1: The “Uh-Oh” Baseline

* **BP:** 160/88
* **A1C:** 6.5 % (official diabetes cutoff)
* **Weight:** 278 lbs
* **Resting HR:** 90–100 bpm
* **Diet:** Costco-sized sodium, random take-out carbs, and “coffee” that was 70 % creamer.

Lisinopril 5 mg went into the rotation, and I turned my inner nerd loose.

# 📊 Phase 2: Operation DASH & Data

I built a daily log in ChatGPT: BP, HR, glucose, weight, Lumen fuel mix, food macros, and notes like “felt like death” or “smelled barbecue but resisted.”

**Rules I followed:**

1. **DASH diet as the base** → 1,500–1,800 kcal/day, low sodium (< 1,800 mg), moderate carbs, lots of potassium & fiber.
2. **Protein coffee = breakfast** → Javvy Protein Coffee became my morning ritual: caffeine + 16 g protein + zero prep.
3. **Lunch = color & crunch** → Salads, smoothies, fruit, beans, and occasional turkey or chicken.
4. **Dinner = real food, smart swaps** → Asada plate? Sure — but no tortillas or rice, add eggs & veggies. → Cajun fish? Fine — skip the fries or pair with salad.
5. **Feed days** (2 200 kcal) to stay sane. Because life needs tacos *and* balance.

# 💡 Phase 3: What Actually Happened

* **BP:** dropped to 120s/70s within two weeks.
* **Glucose:** morning 70s–90s, post-meal rarely > 130.
* **Weight:** down 16 lbs (278 → 262).
* **Resting HR:** now in the 50s.
* **A1C (projected):** likely 5.8–6.0 %. (Update in Nov)
* **Side effects:** looser ring fit, cooler skin (no constant “human furnace” feeling), clearer head.

The big win? I became *metabolically flexible.* My Lumen readings swing between fat-burn and carb-burn depending on what I eat, meaning my system actually works again. Note I had tried, and failed Keto style before this, so I'm already tuned for fat burning. 

# 🍴 Phase 4: The “Fun” Lessons

* **Sodium cheats fast; fat cheats slow.** One salty dinner? BP jumps overnight. Too much saturated fat? You won’t see it for months, but your arteries will remember.
* **Fruit is not the enemy.** A pound of watermelon is still better than a vending-machine “energy” bar.
* **Cook once, eat smart.** 2 cups oats + 3.5 cups milk on Sunday = breakfast all week.
* **Numbers make it a game.** Seeing your own data flatten a BP curve is weirdly addictive.

# 🔥 For Anyone Starting Out

1. **Pick one metric** (BP, glucose, or calories) and log it daily.
2. **Cut obvious salt bombs** first — canned soups, sauces, deli meats.
3. **Add protein** to every meal; it keeps you full and smooths out glucose.
4. **Move a little.** Even yard work counts (my Fitbit thinks I farm).
5. **Don’t fear “feed days.”** They keep metabolism and sanity intact.
6. **Laugh when you mess up.** I once “rewarded” a perfect week with garlic fries. BP said nope. Still worth it.

# 🧠 Final Thoughts

I didn’t do this with keto, fasting, or magic supplements.  
I just ate real food, tracked what mattered, and treated health like debugging code — change one variable, watch the output, iterate. I used ChatGPT to negotiate on what foods fit for my daily balance, what I can subtract or add to balance things out. 

**Result:** lower BP, normal glucose, smaller belly, bigger life.  
If my spreadsheet-obsessed, taco-loving self can pull it off, so can you.

**TL;DR:**  
Sept 11, 2025 — hypertensive & diabetic borderline.  
Oct 21, 2025 — normal BP, normal glucose, down 16 lbs, still loves Asada.  
The secret weapon = data + DASH diet + humor.

I started running in April last year and ran a half marathon in 1:54 that same year. This year, I wanted to step it up and try a full marathon, so I chose the Victoria Marathon (RVM).

For training, I downloaded the free *Coffee Bullet Marathon* plan with a 3:45 goal. Unfortunately, I got injured during the training and thought maybe it was due to the mileage, so I switched to the 4:00-hour plan. However, in my mind, I still wanted to aim for 3:45 on race day.

My plan was to run the first part at 5:00 min/km and reassess later, but I felt good and kept going. Around 33 km, I felt a sharp pain in my foot but decided to continue. Since I had never run more than 33 km before, I figured it was just the discomfort of entering uncharted territory. My pace slowed down after that, and I also had some stomach cramps, but I managed to finish in 3:35.

A few days later, after visiting an orthopedist, I found out it was actually a stress fracture. Still, I’m glad I was able to complete the marathon, and I’m hoping to come back stronger next year.

When I registered for the marathon, my target was actually 6:30 hours, so I ended up starting way behind the main pack — definitely a bad decision on my part.

Thanks for all your help and advice, everyone!

1ocotxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1ocotxd/i_want_him_to_love_me/,I want him to love me.,"I’m honestly so sick of my boyfriend and everything about this relationship lately. I’m 21F and he’s 22M (we have been together for a year), and it feels like I’m taking care of a grown man who refuses to act like one. He showers maybe twice a week same with brushing his teeth, sometimes less, and it’s gotten to the point where I literally don’t even want to be near him. It’s gross. I’ve brought it up gently, I’ve asked him nicely, I’ve straight-up told him it’s nasty, but nothing changes. We live together, we share a bed, a house, a dog — and it’s like he doesn’t care at all about hygiene or effort anymore. 

I pay for everything. Groceries, gas, coffee every morning, random takeout, every single vet bill for our dog, everything. He doesn’t even have a car, so I’m the one driving everywhere and covering all the expenses. It’s exhausting. He works with me sometimes when I need an extra hand for my business, but it’s inconsistent, and honestly I only pay him partially because I’m already the one keeping both of us afloat. And somehow he still acts like I’m stingy for not paying him “properly” — like, are you kidding me? I’m paying for both of our lives!

When he does have money, he never contributes. Ever. He doesn’t offer to pay for groceries, doesn’t fill the gas tank, doesn’t take me out — nothing. The only thing he spends money on is video games. That’s it. New games, new add-ons, new accessories — whatever. I come home after a long day, and he’s sitting there, headset on, completely zoned out, playing for hours. The dishes are still in the sink, the dog hasn’t been walked, the house is a mess, and he’s yelling into his mic like a teenager. I feel like I’m living with a roommate who contributes nothing except noise and dirty laundry.

And lately, there’s this weird gym thing that’s been driving me crazy. He’s started going to the gym with his buddy, which at first I thought was great — maybe he’s finally doing something productive. But then I noticed this weird pattern. Some days they go straight in and start their workout right away, but other days he just doesn’t answer my texts for an hour or more. Then, out of nowhere, he’ll message me saying, “Just starting my workout.” So I asked him what he’s been doing that whole time, sitting there in the parking lot for an hour. His answer? “I was drinking my Monster.” Like seriously? You were sitting in a car for an hour just drinking an energy drink? That’s the kind of weird behavior that makes me feel like something’s off. I’m not even saying he’s cheating or anything, it’s just… it’s odd. Why not just say that’s what you’re doing instead of ignoring me completely? It’s the ignoring that bothers me. It feels disrespectful. 

But every time I try to talk to him about anything — hygiene, money, effort, communication, whatever — he immediately gets defensive. He tells me to “shut up,” “fuck off,” or calls me “bossy.” Like I’m supposed to just stay quiet and keep paying for his entire life while he sits around doing nothing. I’m not being controlling, I’m just asking for basic respect and partnership. I shouldn’t have to beg my boyfriend to shower, to help with bills, or to talk to me like a decent human being.

I’m exhausted. I’m tired of feeling like the only adult here. I’m tired of having to do everything myself — for our dog, our house, our finances, our lives — while he acts like a dependent child who doesn’t care. I used to love him so much, but now I just feel drained and disappointed every single day. It’s like I’m slowly realizing that I don’t even have a partner — I have another responsibility. I feel unappreciated, disrespected, and completely taken for granted.

I’m honestly starting to think I deserve better than this. And I hate that it’s taken me this long to realize that love isn’t enough when you’re the only one trying.

Side note:
What really gets me is that when his friends want to hang out, suddenly he’s a whole new person. He showers, brushes his teeth, puts on deodorant, sprays cologne, and actually tries to look good. He won’t even do that for me. But the second his buddies text him, he’s up and ready like it’s nothing. And whenever I mention anything — like the fact that I pay for everything or that he doesn’t pull his weight — especially in front of other people, he gets all mad and embarrassed, like I’m the one doing something wrong. It’s honestly so frustrating.

I was also thinking of applying to donabate but I think this is further from town and also acknowledge that I may not be offered a property on this scheme.

If you live in District 1, this may impact your vote for who you want to represent you.

The Coloradoan article outlines a messy fight for the environmental soul of Fort Collins and everybody's not their best selves. Instead of working out these issues in public and reaching scientifically supported conclusions, we have a factional fight.

My consistent stance on these kinds of battles (whether YIMBY, Preserve, Hughes, PATHS, whatever) would be to push for change, backed by data. Show your receipts. Wage that campaign in public with sunlight. To do anything less undermines trust, even if the science supports you (and good luck if the data doesn’t support you).

My critique here is that what happened reads less like movement-building or community shifting and more like a strategic maneuver to secure influence over endorsements. It damaged the public trust in environmental and housing advocacy. I’d tell the Preserve/PATHS folks exactly the same thing because their approach has also been needlessly corrosive and divisive.

Two things can be true at once:

– The way this was done looks like a coup because YIMBY pushed too hard to achieve their goal without bringing the community along.

– The Sierra Club’s local chapter needed reform (I witnessed this need firsthand when I ran in 2021. The then Board president was also my competitor's campaign manager... and when the Sierra Club sent out their questionnaires, mine was rejected on the premise that ""they already had their preferred candidate"".)

It looks reasonable, based on the timeline, that Chris Conway had an eye on endorsements because he was directly quoted as saying so while using the YIMBY Slack channel to recruit.

Chris publicly declared for D1 shortly after the events described in the article (12/10/24), and was talking about a run as early as October 2024 (he and I met for coffee to discuss his candidacy on 10/3/24). The Slack messages were from September, the Sierra Club election was in December, and Jensen’s and Chris’s own quotes acknowledge that endorsements were part of the motivation to shift leadership. 

Correlation is not causation, but it certainly begs for reasonable scrutiny on how those events intersected with a Council run. Chris certainly would have benefited if the Sierra Club, under new leadership, had issued endorsements.

From the article:

\--

""We're part of a push to promote a more progressive leadership"" in the Poudre Canyon Group, a post from Conway in September 2024 said. ""They have been notoriously anti-housing for years!""

""Last year they declined to endorse any of our progressive leaders on housing, despite infill being a critical tool in the fight against climate change,"" Conway continued.

\--

""I was aware of the value of Sierra Club endorsements,"" Jensen said, admitting that the group's previous endorsements motivated the effort to get new leadership, ""but there was no specific angle related to a candidate or a public ballot measure. If there were, I believe that would undermine the independence of the organization and would be problematic.""

\--

So, the question becomes, what do I expect of a candidate who is the subject of an article like this? Certainly not a factional fight. It should be a conversation, in public, with clear facts, because that’s how trust is built. That’s the kind of leadership I want to see in District 1.

The appearance of a coup to score endorsements matters because movements are built on trust, not just alignment. If candidates want to lead this community, they need to build confidence that they can achieve their goals through transparent, fair processes.

If we continue responding to conflict with factional fights instead of open, honest community dialogue, Fort Collins loses. The trust we need in institutions and movements to solve hard problems like housing, climate, and equity is lost.",3,1761080018.0,FortCollins,6,0.67,False

I've been traveling a lot lately for work, and I wanted to share my experience finding the perfect wireless mouse for my laptop. After trying numerous options and dealing with plenty of frustration, I think I've finally found some solid solutions.

Initially, I was using the trackpad on my laptop, but let's be real - it's not ideal for long work sessions. I needed something portable yet reliable, and most importantly, comfortable for those long hours at coffee shops or hotel rooms.

I spent weeks researching and testing different travel mice, and I discovered that the key factors to consider are:

1. Size and portability
2. Battery life
3. Connectivity options
4. Ergonomics
5. Surface compatibility

One standout option I found (which you can check out here: https://athometouch.com/wireless-mouse) has been incredibly reliable. It's compact enough to slip into my laptop bag but doesn't feel too small in my hands. The battery lasts forever - I'm talking months of regular use.

What really surprised me was how well it works on different surfaces. I've used it on glass tables, wooden desks, even my jeans when I'm working on trains! The optical sensor is pretty impressive.

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Always carry spare batteries (even though you probably won't need them)
- Look for mice with on/off switches to preserve battery life
- Consider getting one with Bluetooth to save your USB ports
- Make sure it has good palm support if you work long hours

After trying several options, I keep coming back to this particular model (https://athometouch.com/wireless-mouse). It hits all the right notes for travel use - lightweight, responsive, and reliable.

Here's what I love most about it:
- It pairs instantly
- Works on almost any surface
- Doesn't take up much space
- Has programmable buttons
- The scroll wheel is smooth and precise

For those who travel frequently, I can't stress enough how important a good wireless mouse is. It's one of those things that can make or break your productivity when you're on the road.

Remember to consider your specific needs. If you're doing detailed work like design or editing, you might want something with higher DPI settings. For general use, any decent wireless mouse will do the job.

Let me know if you have any questions - I'm happy to share more details about my experience!",1,1761079987.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

Hey, thanks for stopping by! Just putting myself out here to hopefully make some lasting friendships. If you like occasional banter, usually meaningful conversations, mistimed jokes, exchanging little nuggets from everyday life, and even sharing thoughts that won't be spoken out loud, read on! 

I'm from Australia, working full-time. I volunteer sometimes and spend the rest of my time cooking, reading, budgeting, contemplating life choices, and dealing with casual bouts of existential crisis. I've been on a dedicated health journey since 2017, and kind of proud of all the progress. I've learned, unlearned, relearned a lot on my own, and am always looking to deepen and expand my knowledge that I can practically apply. I don't smoke. I'd like to say that I don't do drugs either, but that'd be a non-truth considering the amount of coffee I drink before midday. I only occasionally drink alcohol but prefer avoiding it mostly. I recently rediscovered the joy of listening to audio books after a long pause. Personality wise, I'm typically a calm and collected guy. I'm not constantly seeking the next dopamine spike or adrenaline rush. I'm irreligious but respect people's choice to believe. I value balance, respect, peace, and sincerity.

1ocopeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimMarriage/comments/1ocopeh/fiancé_wants_me_to_spend_less_time_talking_about/,Fiancé wants me to spend less time talking about my health problems,"Assalamu alaikum,

I (22F) am going through a rough patch in my engagement and I'd love to get a fresh, unbiased perspective on whether there's anything I can do differently to be less of an emotional burden on my fiancé (23M). We're hundreds of miles apart but up until recently we've been doing well. I decided to check in with him last night and ask how he felt things were going between us. I was really surprised by his answer. He was very open and honest, which I appreciate, and he said that he didn't think we were doing well (partially due to the distance). He has also been questioning whether he could handle some cultural differences between us. For context, he's from a western part of India and I'm American and my mom is from Belarus. I asked him today what he meant by cultural differences. One of the things he described was differences in upbringing. He said that he always tries to be thankful in all circumstances and that even if he has a lot of problems going on, he tries to be grateful instead of complaining. That he has trust in Allah's plan and that if he's complaining, it means he's ungrateful and he suggested I think about those who have it worse than me when I'm feeling down. He further explained that 80% of the time, we're talking about problems and that he wants to talk about positive things more often such as our plans for the future. He said that when a person is with someone who they love, they want to feel happy in that moment because they are already struggling with their own stuff. By problems, what he was referring to were my health problems.

For context, I've been dealing with debilitating fatigue which I think is related to my low ferritin levels. I'm a very solution oriented person and I've been described by my closest friends as pretty positive (which is why this took me by surprise). Before this past month, I was extremely healthy and fit, going to the gym five times a day and almost every day was a good day. He was there for that and back then, we were doing really well. Whenever I bring up something negative to him, I make sure it's essential (for example, if my health is going to influence my levels of affection or mood that day), I explain what I'm going to do to address it, and I try to offset the negativity by mentioning things I'm grateful for. For example, today I woke up feeling like I had the flu and I didn't sleep well. He asked me how I was doing and I said I was (just) okay, I didn't sleep well but I was going to take my ADHD meds and have some coffee to feel better. I only told him I didn't sleep well because I knew I was going to feel physically awful today and I didn't want him to take anything I might unintentionally say or do (or not do), personally.

He seems to be able to conceal his struggles and pain - he doesn't even tell me he has a headache unless it's been going on for days. But I'm an external processor. This means I'm the type of person who needs to talk through their feelings to feel better. To address my needs, I go to therapy and vent to my friends and my mom and I journal. Like I mentioned before, I generally only talk to my fiance about my problems when I know it's going to influence our interactions. The only exception was when I had a health scare and I had to call an ambulance (alhamdulillah, everything was fine). He asked how I was doing. I broke down and told him how hopeless I felt about my health and how I wasn't sure I was ever going to feel better. This was before I knew what was wrong with me medically. The next day, he said the relationship was becoming depressing and that he wasn't sure he could handle my health issues because he couldn't do anything to help. We've since talked things through and after my lab results came back with an answer, things drastically improved. He's since affirmed that he's going to be able to handle it and that he'll ask Allah for strength. So I thought we were doing well until yesterday.

I asked him what he thinks should change so that we're both happy. He said I'm not doing anything wrong but that he wishes we could talk about something other than my problems. This makes me worried for the future because I don't feel like I can be open with him about my struggles. From my point of view, he doesn't handle it well when he can't do anything to solve my problems and all he can do is provide emotional support. He appears to struggle to be emotionally present in moments of discomfort where there is no clear solution. He says things like ""Please don't cry or I'll cry, too"". He loves doing acts of service and he's convinced this will be a non issue when we live together. But I'm concerned about what would happen if I was sick with something chronic and/or painful and bringing me a cup of tea or doing the dishes for me for a week or two isn't going to cut it. In those moments, I'd need emotional support. 

I've had on and off illnesses for all my life. This has never been an issue before in any of my past friendships or relationships and as I've said before, the people around me generally describe me as a positive and uplifting presence no matter how I feel. I hate that expressing my feelings in an honest way is wearing him down this much and I want to meet him halfway. But I don't know how to do that without simply lying, saying I'm doing great, and then isolating myself until I feel well. Maybe there's a compromise that can be made to meet both of our needs. Or maybe we're incompatible.

1ocomlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ocomlb/google_isnt_the_only_map_in_town/,Google Isn’t the Only Map in Town,"Like many small business owners, for long time I assumed Google Maps was the only game in town. But don’t forget presence on different map apps and (navigation and thematic POI) apps.

Especially OpenStreetMap (OSM) is often overlooked (and the SEO-guy often isn’t aware either), although it powers maps and navigationin hundreds of apps. OSM doesn't have a nice and shiny app themselves, but other apps and maps use OSM data.

If you've ever wondered why your business isn't shown on a map (while similar businesses are), even though you’re on Google Maps, this might be one of the reasons.

I didn't know this for a long time either, but it's good to know that you can add your business quite easily in a few steps. There are several ways to do this, but the simplest (and ‘dummy-proof’) is probably the following:

1. Open an account on [openstreetmap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new) (free).
2. Download the EveryDoor\* app ( [every-door.app](https://every-door.app) , can be deleted afterwards) and log in with your account (settings page).
3. Open the amenities tab (the coffee cup), zoom in on your area, and update the area info (red bar).
4. edit/add your business, including selecting the correct category, address, etc., adding a website, etc.
5. Don't forget to upload. That's it.

\* You can also directly modify on the openstreetmap website, but that’s somewhat more complicated and less ‘dummy-proof’.



Good to know:

* OpenStreetMap focuses on factual information. Not reviews or non-factual information like '*we have the best .... in town*'.
* Not all apps and maps that rely on OSM are updated overnight, so it may take several weeks for your business to appear on the relevant maps.",2,1761079773.0,smallbusiness,1,0.75,False
1ocomji,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1ocomji/i_wish_he_would_help_me_more/,I wish he would help me more.,"I’m honestly so sick of my boyfriend and everything about this relationship lately. I’m 21F and he’s 22M (we have been together for a year), and it feels like I’m taking care of a grown man who refuses to act like one. He showers maybe twice a week same with brushing his teeth, sometimes less, and it’s gotten to the point where I literally don’t even want to be near him. It’s gross. I’ve brought it up gently, I’ve asked him nicely, I’ve straight-up told him it’s nasty, but nothing changes. We live together, we share a bed, a house, a dog — and it’s like he doesn’t care at all about hygiene or effort anymore. 

I pay for everything. Groceries, gas, coffee every morning, random takeout, every single vet bill for our dog, everything. He doesn’t even have a car, so I’m the one driving everywhere and covering all the expenses. It’s exhausting. He works with me sometimes when I need an extra hand for my business, but it’s inconsistent, and honestly I only pay him partially because I’m already the one keeping both of us afloat. And somehow he still acts like I’m stingy for not paying him “properly” — like, are you kidding me? I’m paying for both of our lives!

When he does have money, he never contributes. Ever. He doesn’t offer to pay for groceries, doesn’t fill the gas tank, doesn’t take me out — nothing. The only thing he spends money on is video games. That’s it. New games, new add-ons, new accessories — whatever. I come home after a long day, and he’s sitting there, headset on, completely zoned out, playing for hours. The dishes are still in the sink, the dog hasn’t been walked, the house is a mess, and he’s yelling into his mic like a teenager. I feel like I’m living with a roommate who contributes nothing except noise and dirty laundry.

And lately, there’s this weird gym thing that’s been driving me crazy. He’s started going to the gym with his buddy, which at first I thought was great — maybe he’s finally doing something productive. But then I noticed this weird pattern. Some days they go straight in and start their workout right away, but other days he just doesn’t answer my texts for an hour or more. Then, out of nowhere, he’ll message me saying, “Just starting my workout.” So I asked him what he’s been doing that whole time, sitting there in the parking lot for an hour. His answer? “I was drinking my Monster.” Like seriously? You were sitting in a car for an hour just drinking an energy drink? That’s the kind of weird behavior that makes me feel like something’s off. I’m not even saying he’s cheating or anything, it’s just… it’s odd. Why not just say that’s what you’re doing instead of ignoring me completely? It’s the ignoring that bothers me. It feels disrespectful. 

But every time I try to talk to him about anything — hygiene, money, effort, communication, whatever — he immediately gets defensive. He tells me to “shut up,” “fuck off,” or calls me “bossy.” Like I’m supposed to just stay quiet and keep paying for his entire life while he sits around doing nothing. I’m not being controlling, I’m just asking for basic respect and partnership. I shouldn’t have to beg my boyfriend to shower, to help with bills, or to talk to me like a decent human being.

I’m exhausted. I’m tired of feeling like the only adult here. I’m tired of having to do everything myself — for our dog, our house, our finances, our lives — while he acts like a dependent child who doesn’t care. I used to love him so much, but now I just feel drained and disappointed every single day. It’s like I’m slowly realizing that I don’t even have a partner — I have another responsibility. I feel unappreciated, disrespected, and completely taken for granted.

I’m honestly starting to think I deserve better than this. And I hate that it’s taken me this long to realize that love isn’t enough when you’re the only one trying.

Side note:
What really gets me is that when his friends want to hang out, suddenly he’s a whole new person. He showers, brushes his teeth, puts on deodorant, sprays cologne, and actually tries to look good. He won’t even do that for me. But the second his buddies text him, he’s up and ready like it’s nothing. And whenever I mention anything — like the fact that I pay for everything or that he doesn’t pull his weight — especially in front of other people, he gets all mad and embarrassed, like I’m the one doing something wrong. It’s honestly so frustrating.

Some days they go straight in and start their workout right away, but other days he just doesn’t answer my texts for an hour or more. Then, out of nowhere, he’ll message me saying, “Just starting my workout.” So I asked him what he’s been doing that whole time, sitting there in the parking lot for an hour. His answer? “I was drinking my Monster.” Like seriously? You were sitting in a car for an hour just drinking an energy drink? That’s the kind of weird behavior that makes me feel like something’s off. I’m not even saying he’s cheating or anything, it’s just… it’s odd. Why not just say that’s what you’re doing instead of ignoring me completely? It’s the ignoring that bothers me. It feels disrespectful. 

But every time I try to talk to him about anything — hygiene, money, effort, communication, whatever — he immediately gets defensive. He tells me to “shut up,” “fuck off,” or calls me “bossy.” Like I’m supposed to just stay quiet and keep paying for his entire life while he sits around doing nothing. I’m not being controlling, I’m just asking for basic respect and partnership. I shouldn’t have to beg my boyfriend to shower, to help with bills, or to talk to me like a decent human being.

I’m exhausted. I’m tired of feeling like the only adult here. I’m tired of having to do everything myself — for our dog, our house, our finances, our lives — while he acts like a dependent child who doesn’t care. I used to love him so much, but now I just feel drained and disappointed every single day. It’s like I’m slowly realizing that I don’t even have a partner — I have another responsibility. I feel unappreciated, disrespected, and completely taken for granted.

I’m honestly starting to think I deserve better than this. And I hate that it’s taken me this long to realize that love isn’t enough when you’re the only one trying.

Side note:
What really gets me is that when his friends want to hang out, suddenly he’s a whole new person. He showers, brushes his teeth, puts on deodorant, sprays cologne, and actually tries to look good. He won’t even do that for me. But the second his buddies text him, he’s up and ready like it’s nothing. And whenever I mention anything — like the fact that I pay for everything or that he doesn’t pull his weight — especially in front of other people, he gets all mad and embarrassed, like I’m the one doing something wrong. It’s honestly so frustrating.

I’m 21F and he’s 22M (we have been together for a year), and it feels like I’m taking care of a grown man who refuses to act like one. He showers maybe twice a week same with brushing his teeth, sometimes less, and it’s gotten to the point where I literally don’t even want to be near him. It’s gross. I’ve brought it up gently, I’ve asked him nicely, I’ve straight-up told him it’s nasty, but nothing changes. We live together, we share a bed, a house, a dog — and it’s like he doesn’t care at all about hygiene or effort anymore. 

I pay for everything. Groceries, gas, coffee every morning, random takeout, every single vet bill for our dog, everything. He doesn’t even have a car, so I’m the one driving everywhere and covering all the expenses. It’s exhausting. He works with me sometimes when I need an extra hand for my business, but it’s inconsistent, and honestly I only pay him partially because I’m already the one keeping both of us afloat. And somehow he still acts like I’m stingy for not paying him “properly” — like, are you kidding me? I’m paying for both of our lives!

When he does have money, he never contributes. Ever. He doesn’t offer to pay for groceries, doesn’t fill the gas tank, doesn’t take me out — nothing. The only thing he spends money on is video games. That’s it. New games, new add-ons, new accessories — whatever. I come home after a long day, and he’s sitting there, headset on, completely zoned out, playing for hours. The dishes are still in the sink, the dog hasn’t been walked, the house is a mess, and he’s yelling into his mic like a teenager. I feel like I’m living with a roommate who contributes nothing except noise and dirty laundry.

And lately, there’s this weird gym thing that’s been driving me crazy. He’s started going to the gym with his buddy, which at first I thought was great — maybe he’s finally doing something productive. But then I noticed this weird pattern.

1ocohm5,https://www.reddit.com/r/passive_income/comments/1ocohm5/i_got_fired_for_making_spicy_ebooks_at_work_so_i/,I Got Fired for Making Spicy Ebooks at Work. So I Built a system  to Replace My Job… with spicy ebooks.,"My job was falling apart, and I could feel it. So I started doing something kind of ridiculous — writing spicy fiction ebooks with ChatGPT under a fake female pen name, just to see if it would actually make money.

The first books were terrible. They took an entire day to finish, and most weren’t readable. But one sold. I remember saying, “If this thing ever makes one dollar, I’m celebrating.” It did.

That small hit of validation kept me going.

Then, August, 2025, I got fired — basically for doing what I was already spending most of my time on: writing ebooks.

Instead of quitting, I decided to automate the whole process.

I bought a Mac mini M4, installed Cursor, and — with ChatGPT helping me code line by line — built a Next.js app to handle everything I’d been doing manually.

I called it Bookgur.app

It’s fiction-only. The app writes the story, formats the EPUB, generates a cover, writes the blurb, and spits out keywords so I can copy and paste them into KDP.

Now I can go from idea to published book in about 10 minutes total — five to generate, five to publish.

Amazon used to let you publish up to 500 books a day, but after the flood of low-quality AI content, they dropped the limit to 3 per day.
That didn’t stop me.
Three a day is 90 a month. Over a year, that adds up to a serious catalog.

I currently have around 250 ebooks live under different pen names. Most don’t make much — probably half are total flops — but a few have taken off and earn $100+ a month each.

That’s the compounding part. The hits carry the rest.

I use the 5-day free promo cycles (15 books at a time, then recycled every 90 days), and I make AI-generated TikTok reels to push them. Some take off randomly, some die instantly.

I even created a spicy gothic AI author persona — complete with an Amazon page and TikTok account. She actually has a following now.

My girlfriend tested the setup for 10 days back in August and made about $100 her first month.
When I tested my own uploads and promos, I made around $600 in the first 60 days.

Now I spend roughly 30 minutes a day managing uploads and promo loops. It’s not a get-rich-quick setup — it’s slow, weird, and compounding. But it works.

The beta is free right now. You can create your first three books for free and keep whatever they earn. After that, $30/month covers my API costs (and honestly, helps fund my coffee and medical MJ so I can keep working on this thing).

I plan to start doing live workshops soon to share what’s worked, what’s failed, and how far this experiment can really go.

It’s not a startup pitch. It’s just something I built with ChatGPT after losing my job — and somehow, it’s paying me back for getting fired.

Spent the last decade doing the whole ""corporate strategy"" thing - IIM MBA, worked across KSA/UAE, built an AgriTech data exchange, represented Telangana at Davos (yes, *that* Davos), the usual résumé jazz.

But here's the fun part: Just spent a month in Delhi embedded with 3 EdTech startups. Mission was beautifully simple - watch how things *actually* work, find where the wheels fall off, suggest fixes, and build processes that don't fall apart when the founder takes a vacation.

The experience was... surreal? Equal parts fascinating and ""how is this even functioning?!""

Turns out, most small businesses run on founder intuition, WhatsApp groups, and prayers. Which works until it very suddenly doesn't.

**If you're running a startup/small business and:**

* Your team asks ""what's the process?"" and you reply ""just ask me""
* You're scaling but operations feel like controlled chaos
* You need actual SOPs that humans will actually follow
* Want someone to assess your business, craft growth strategies, or figure out market entry

**I'm your guy.** DM me. First coffee's on you, business advice is on me.

Also do: Business assessments, growth strategy, market entry/expansion planning, and occasionally preventing founders from making hilariously expensive mistakes.

1ocoffn,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ocoffn/i_love_my_grandma_but_i_cant_stand_her_and_i_feel/,I love my grandma but I can't stand her and I feel bad about it,"I love my grandma but she is so difficult. Some context we're Asian, so she's lived with us since I was a baby. She more or less raised me and my siblings when our parents were at work. I have always been closer to her than my parents because I was pretty rebellious and she would always be the person I'd run to when I fought with mom and dad. 

But these days it's hard to be around her. It's horrible and I'm definitely an asshole. I think she has always been like this but I used to not see it because of rose-tinted grandma glasses. 

The main problem is that she doesn't know how to hold a conversation, like at all. Have you ever tried to talk to someone who just repeats the exact same things you said back to you but presents it as brand new information that they're teaching you? I'll say ""We're going to dinner at 5pm"" and she'll reply ""Hey we're going to dinner at 5pm."" and it's, something. It would be ok if she just repeats information, but it's the tone. Like she knows everything before you say it.

I'll tell her ""Wow my college friend's getting married next Monday"" and she'll be like ""Yes, of course they are."" Ok. 

It's like an echo chamber but the echo chamber is condescending. I can never hear information once because if my dad says anything she'll repeat it as if she's the one who spoke first. She will mishear something, repeat it back to me, and then when I correct myself, she goes ""Yes that's what I said."" 

It's embarrassing to be around her in public because she wants to be the smartest person in the room but she's just regurgitating what the person she's talking to says back to them. 

And she keeps messing with my things without asking, which I feel petty for complaining about. Just recently I left a full thermos of coffee on the table when I went to work, and she poured it out, rinsed my thermos, and got mad when I didn't thank her. And a previous time she put my delicates in the dryer and ruined an expensive bra. And another time she mistook my package as trash and threw it out. I know she just wants to help, but she's just making more work and its so... annoying, I'm sorry to say. I tell her all the time she doesn't have to ""help"" but she just keeps doing it even when I complain to her that she's messed up my stuff. I know she probably wants to spend time with me but all she's doing is pissing me off. 

I don't know what to do. I love my grandma but interacting with her is frustrating and embarrassing. And honestly, I leave most interactions with her pissed off or at least annoyed. I know some of it is aging, but it's not dementia (we tested) and the way my parents tell it, she's always been this way and I guess I just never saw it as an issue until I started spening more time at home.

I wonder if she's this way because she doesn't get a lot of practice with like, conversation. She's a homebody, gardens everyday, and watches a lot of HK dramas. I encourage her to call up her friends more (she can't really figure out her phone aside from calls and the photo gallery so texting isn't an option) but she always says they'll be too busy for her. I think she knows she's not the best conversationalist but I keep telling her she should keep in touch with them anyway. 

So yea, I feel like the biggest jackass in the world saying it but spending time with her is a chore. If she's not spreading misinformation like chatgpt, she's ""helping"" by creating more issues for me to deal with. ",1,1761079313.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1oco8mv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oco8mv,Is there a diy solution to these?,"We had our counters installed last week and it didn’t go that well to be honest. 

The company is now giving us a lot of excuses on why they can’t fix the things that happened so I’m hoping I can get some input from the professionals on what is plausible for a fairly experienced DIYer to try and fix. I’ve laid tile, built cabinets, plastered, dry walled, ect… but I haven’t really approached stonework so I’m not sure what tools would be best to learn or practice with. The company let me pick up the cutouts from the sink and cooktop to use for another project and I figured I could practice on those pieces before anything big. The marble is all factory honed so maybe that makes these fixes a tad easier?

Here’s some of the things they aren’t offering to fix that I’m hoping are possible to fix on my own. I don’t really have the budget to hire another company at this point.

- (picture 1-4) A smaller section of marble was from a different slab for a coffee nook and was a different variety of Marble. Apparently I didn’t examine it close enough and it has a lot of these small pinholes throughout it. Our main countertop doesn’t have this issue at all. It looks like there’s a lot of resin filled in already so I feel like epoxy might be the best option? Any ideas? The first four pictures show the holes I’m worried about. I’m only concerned about filling in the countertop holes because I know coffee grounds will eventually find their way into them. 

- (picture 5) There’s a sizable scratch in the counter from the install - not sure if anything can actually be done about that or if it’s just the first patina that we’re starting with. 

- (picture 6-9) They also had a few cracks that happened during the install process. the pieces they epoxied together still feel pretty rough to the touch. A couple edges settled more over the weekend and stick out now. Almost all of these feel a little sharp. I feel like someone could easily cut their finger while cleaning accidentally. 

I get that the sub doesn’t seem to be fans of marble - I just want to say that I really love the actual marble - the color is great. The kitchen is starting to feel like a real space now. I realize this material will age/stain/etch/scratch over time but I’m more concerned about the sharpness of some of the pieces and doing some preventative work before we start using the space. It would also be good to know how to fix these kinds of things if a piece ever chipped off or anything like that in the future. 

The job was a little over $8k for one slab and a remnant. I think it was a little over 65sqft of material for a u shaped kitchen and two backsplashes. They offered $300 back for cutting a piece too small and installing one of the pieces upside down so far. My husband thought I should ask for more back but I’m not very good at sticking up for myself so I’d rather just fix it and move on. ",2,1761078877.0,CounterTops,16,1.0,False

We're at the final stretch! ...Actually, not quite yet. There's still a part or two left. However, these are the final plant powers that may have Synergies!

As usual, you have **4 slots** to fill, in addition to any you saved from prior parts.

**33. Cabbage-pult**

Recharge: 1 use per day

Bonus: You gain ability to calculate complex trajectories or aerodynamics in your head and intuitively operate complex machinery. You also gain the ability to observe a square kilometer centered on yourself from a bird's eye view. Any and all vegetable dishes you create will be delicious.

On use, you can conjure a catapult, trebuchet, ballista, or similar medieval siege weaponry. These weapons don't require ammunition and fire automatically at a rate of once every 15 minutes.

**34. Flower Pot**

Recharge: 3 uses per day

Bonus:  You gain an affinity for earth and plant magic, if applicable.

When used, you can convert up to 1 square kilometer of land into fertile soil capable of nurturing any crop no matter the climate conditions. Alternatively, you can create a wagon or van that's capable of carrying luggage around and slowly moves according to your verbal commands. If a conjured vehicle is empty or unoccupied by a turret, it has the ability to instantly load previously rooted turrets unto its back.

You can burn a use to instantly warp a wagon and its contents to your side. It cannot bring along any living things besides plants in the warp, however.

**35. Kernal-pult**

Recharge: 70 uses per day

Bonus: You can conjure popcorn of any flavor at will and convert any dairy product into another at will. You gain a perfect throwing arm and throwing weapon expertise. If applicable, you obtain an affinity for status effect magic.

When used, you spawn a random throwing weapon in your hand. There is a 60% chance that it is just an aerodynamic stone, but if it is a weapon other than that, hitting an enemy with it will inflict a debuffing status effect on them. Each type of weapon will consistently be associated with the same status effect.

The throwing weapons dissipate after they're thrown, but can be put down for future use by yourself or others. You may burn 70 uses at once to conjure a crate with the weapons already sorted for you.

**36. Coffee Bean**

Recharge: 1 use per week

Bonus: You can conjure up refreshing and energizing drinks of any time if you have a container for it. You perpetually feel well-rested and can live off 1 hour of sleep per day if you wish.

When used, plant abilities with Overdrive can all function even under sunlight for 3 days. Furthermore, when you activate this ability, you enter a state of maximum mental focus for up to 3 days. You will be ""in the zone"" for any task you undertake, you will feel no mental or physical fatigue, and you can even consciously activate hysterical strength at will.  
You'll have to manually disable this buff if you want to sleep, however. The bonus to nocturnal plants is unaffected if you do.

**37. Garlic**

Recharge: 5 uses per week

Bonus: You can conjure up high quality garlic, onion, ginger, and similar aromatic herbs. You also have an encyclopedic knowledge of all recipes that use said ingredients. You gain an affinity for spatial magic, if applicable.

On use, you can convert an item or 1 square foot into a teleportation trap into a location within 50 meters of the trap. This trap has 37 charges before it runs out, but only affects hostiles.

You can teleport non-hostiles a single time by burning a full use. but every living thing requires its own charge to move.

**38. Umbrella Leaf**

Recharge: 1 use per week

Bonus: You can extend any buffs or beneficial effects on yourself to anyone within 5 meters (note that things like physical damage may transfer to you as well depending on the buff). You are automatically protected from rain, hail, and strong sunlight. You gain an affinity for barrier magic if applicable.

When applied to a target, you render them invulnerable to all ranged attacks for 3 days. This does not include secondary effects of those attacks like explosives, but the ammunition will be stored away on contact with the protected person or object. When the effect expires, you are given an opportunity to sort through stored attacks for your own use before erasing the rest.  
If used without a target, you create an umbrella with a design of your choice that confers the effects to anyone currently carrying it. The umbrella itself remains even after the power expires.  
If used on a structure, it will be protected from aerial attacks and bad weather for a month.

**39. Marigold**

Recharge: 1 use per month

Bonus: You gain the ability to store money or anything widely considered a valuable inside a subspace that only you and those you grant permission can access. You can at will check the total value stored in your inventory and even withdraw converted forms of currency you never deposited. You also gain superb financial sense and the intuition to identify scams or good investments.

On use, you can conjure a plant or object of your choice that grows/expels money once a day starting with the moment it's created. There is a 75% chance that a day's harvest can pay for a single day's food and shelter and a 25% chance that it can pay for a full week's worth of necessities.

**40. Melon-pult**

Recharge: 1 use per month

Bonus: You can convert patches of land into berry fields of any type. These fields will produce crops weekly. You gain an affinity for any supernatural skills/abilities widely considered in your destination world to be the greatest form of firepower.

On use, you can create an infantry explosive weapon of any type. You can also place this weapon on any solid surface to create automated gunpowder-based artillery. This artillery can fire automatically at a rate of 2 shots per hour, with all allies being protected from any damage it does.  
Your conjured weapons and artillery do not require ammo.",4,1761078854.0,6Perks,6,1.0,False
1oco7nh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MoneyDiariesACTIVE/comments/1oco7nh/im_23_years_old_and_i_spent_2434_on_pharmacy/,"I'm 23 years old, and I spent $2434 on pharmacy school graduation and to become a licensed pharmacist","I graduated from pharmacy school and became a licensed pharmacist earlier this year! I wanted to share how much it cost to go through graduation and become licensed, as it was significantly more expensive than I anticipated. It's an investment that's “worth” it in the sense that I recouped the costs relatively quickly via pharmacist pay, but on principle, I find it frustrating that us mostly degree-less college students are required to cough up this amount of money in order to *start* making money.

I paid most of the expenses myself, but my family covered a few things, which are demarcated. I probably paid less than my peers because of family support, both monetarily and through time/labor.

# Graduation: $548.41

**Outfit: $223.41**

* Graduation regalia: $171.41 — my school requires students to buy, not rent :’(
* International flag stole: $52
* Various grad cords: $0 — provided by the organizations I represented
* Grad sash (to wear out at the bars): $0 — bought using a gift card
* Dresses, shoes, makeup, nails, etc.: $0 — didn’t get anything new or pay for anything professional

**Graduation photos: $0** — taken by my dad

**Professional fraternity alum fees: $325**

* I wasn’t required to become an alum member, but I decided it would be beneficial from a community/professional development standpoint

**Moving: $0**

* My family helped me move from campus back home

# Licensure: $1885.41 (+$382.40 paid by my family)

In the United States, the licensure process is done through each state’s Board of Pharmacy. Most states require you to pass both the **NAPLEX** (North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination, the main licensing exam) and the **MPJE** (Multistate Pharmacy Jurisprudence Examination, which covers both federal and state-specific pharmacy law). Both exams are administered by the NABP (National Association of Boards of Pharmacy), a non-governmental organization.

*Fun little factoid:* >!*To my knowledge, there is no other health profession that requires passing a dedicated law exam to become licensed. There’s a lot of discourse in the pharmacist community on the validity of the MPJE. As of right now, four states* [*don’t require passing a law exam*](https://nabp.pharmacy/help/which-states-require-the-mpje/)*. Honestly, after taking the MPJE, I agree that it’s a horrendous evaluation of your ability to practice as a pharmacist.*!<

**Licensure application: $141.67**

* State licensure application: $104.92
   * Application fee: $100
   * Service fee: $2.50
   * Processing fee: $2.42 — What’s the difference between the service fee and the processing fee? Who knows!
* Fingerprinting/criminal background check: $36.75

**Studying for licensing exams: $853.74** ***(+ $200 paid by my family)***

* UWorld RxPrep (popular study resource for the NAPLEX): $249 *(+ $200 paid by my family)* — some pharmacy schools give you free access, but mine unfortunately does not
   * *Physical prep book: $0 — very graciously paid for by my parents, was \~$200 with a promo code from my school*
   * Online question bank (60-day subscription): $249
* Quizlet Plus (annual subscription): $35.99
* Review sessions: $58.75
   * NAPLEX review session: $25
   * MPJE review session: $25
   * Transportation: $8.75
* Official practice exams from NABP: $150
   * NABP Pre-NAPLEX: $75
   * NABP Pre-MPJE: $75
* Miscellaneous other study resources: $0
   * I also used old class lectures, materials from rotations, free practice questions, and free study guides sent by friends
* Coffees/pastries out: \~$360
   * I’m VERY unproductive when I’m at my parents' house, so I went to coffee shops \~4x/week across \~6 weeks, averaging about $15/trip. I don’t have exact numbers because I paid almost exclusively in cash.

**Licensing exams: $890** ***(+ $182.40 paid by my family)***

* *Sending my transcript to NABP to be granted exam eligibility: $12.40 paid by my parents — I didn't have my wallet on me when I needed to send my transcript because I was being a silly goose*
* NAPLEX: $620 *(+ $160 paid by my family)*
   * Exam application: $100
   * Exam purchase: $520
   * *Logistics: $160 paid by parents — \~$50 for gas + \~$100 for one night in a hotel + \~$10 for lunch*
      * It's quite common for people to have to stay in a hotel (or even take a flight) to get to their testing site because scheduling for the exams is such a bloodbath. I purposely scheduled my exam late enough in the day that getting a hotel wasn't absolutely necessary, but my mom was being nice and didn't want to take the chance on anything that could've negatively impacted my test.
* MPJE: $270 *(+ $10 paid by my family)*
   * Exam application: $100
   * Exam purchase: $170
   * *Logistics: $0 (+ $10) — sibling drove me and paid for my lunch*

# Total Spend

* Graduation: $548.41
* Licensure: $1885.41

**Personal total: $2433.82**

* *Amount my family paid: $382.40*
* *Grand total: $2816.22*

# Reflection

I'm just glad it's all over and I (knock on wood) never have to do this again!! The only ""superfluous"" purchases were my coffees/pastries out, but the local coffee shop I went to was the best environment for me to study in. For the most part, everything else was a required expense (e.g. buying the actual exams) or a ""standard"" expense (e.g. the UWorld question bank).

Something that's not accounted for here is the fact that I was living at home, so my parents cooked most of my meals for me. While not an official expense for licensure, that was really priceless, both in the amount of money saved and the time/mental energy that's required in deciding on your own meals. Studying would've been *significantly* harder if I also had to think about feeding myself. 

And like I said at the beginning: when thinking about the decades-long span of my pharmacy career, these expenses will not matter in the grand scheme of things. But it's the principle of the matter!!!",33,1761078815.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,2,1.0,False

Saturday night he texted me after work and said he was tired and probably just going to take a shower and crash. He said he’d call me when he was home. About an hour later I still hadn’t heard from him, so I called him and he said he was going to grab some food, then take a shower and go to bed. I had my phone on speaker, and didn’t hang up right away. I heard a woman talking in the background saying “is she mad?” And he said, “no everything’s cool. All good.” he didn’t mention that he was with anyone so I called him back to find out who it was. He said it was someone that he met at work and they were going out to get something to eat. He knew this when he texted me from work before he left, she was standing right in front of him while he was talking to me and telling me what he was doing, but failed to mention that he was going with some other woman. (Edit: they were at his boat together when I called him)

I called him back and he said that she wanted to treat him to dinner, that she had been a customer before, said she was a cool, interesting chick and they were just grabbing some tacos. If he would’ve just told me from the beginning and not trying to be sneaky about it, I may have reacted differently. But I blew up. I fucking lost it.

This is the third time now that he is lied to me about spending time with other women. He always tells me he’s going to do something else, the first time he said he was going to visit his mom and he was over at his ex’s house all day. The second time were some other customers he met at work and he went to their hotel to hang out and have drinks. Now this is the third time.

He said here there was no intention of doing anything, but if that were the case, why wouldn’t he have just mentioned her? The thing that bothers me is the lying about it. Oh, and he made up another lie that she had a boyfriend in the same line of work as him, and it was supposed to be a sort of networking thing. Which she later admitted was a total lie.

We are supposed to be leaving in one week, I’ve been so excited for months, and it put a lot into taking this trip, and now I’m dreading it completely. I don’t wanna be around him at all. We met up for coffee this morning and I couldn’t even hardly look at him. He’s apologized profusely and tried to explain, but it’s just the pattern of behavior that is so disrespectful and I don’t think I want to be alone on a sailboat with him for three weeks.

Would I be overreacting if I canceled on him?

There was a serial killer who owned a cabin in Northern Maine. We hear about it on the news and realize the suspect is just a few acres down from us and he’s missing.  Suzy and I bolt the doors and try not to think about it.  

Suzy wants to talk about us going to get some groceries in town.  I agree because I want to take my clippers , there is a wild plant that I want for my astrological ceremony.  My gf mentions she’s worried about my mental health after I quit drinking cold turkey.

I assure her the moon in Pisces is why I am feeling crazy. I mention that I must go harvest Reward points at the gas station and can we carry on.

I realize I’m faking every detail.  I realize this is a dream.  Suzy is getting in to drive.  I feel useless.  I buckle up. 

We run into severe thunderstorm hitting our face as our roller coaster ascends.  They hit us like bees, stinging us so hard, reminding us of something important.  It’s coded. 

The roller coaster stops and we jump up.  Deciding to follow the hazy light through the fog, was how we got to the motel. 

We are standing outside the lobby when a very unpleasant lady walks up, she’s like a criminal, maybe a pirate. 

I expect her to ask us for a cigarette but instead she walks up to us and asks if we are really happy with this life.  She suggest we need to get to know our self. 

We say yes, we are happy and we pass by her easily and go to the lobby.  It was just some homeless woman we decide and enter our room. 

We check the coffee.  We get ice.  We go to the bathroom.  Then we go to put our luggage away.  

She was staring at us from the dark of the closest.  It was her. She’s so very creepy and now she’s in our bedroom in our closest, sleeping among us.  And she’s smiling. 

We look at each other and say um, no thank you.  We close the door on her but realize we didn’t make her go away.  We sit on our motel room bed staring at the closet.  It consumes us.  It’s all that’s left of us.  We turn ashy, pale and burn to dust waiting. 

It’s Suzy that is smarter.  She is the one  to suggest there actually was nobody in the closet.   We open it and all that is left is a knife that has the letters Sidwynde etched into it beside a Fuji apple.


The next day we prepare to leave and  the unpleasant homeless lady is standing there outside the lobby.  We smile politely, wave goodbye.

We spend the entire day driving home. I pick up my plant for my astrological ceremony.   Suzy decides she wants beer one last time before winter comes. 

Inside the bar was yet again that unpleasant lady, but this time Suzy decides to approach her.  I walk back away from the two of them.  Suzy is whispering with the unpleasant lady.  

Suzy returns telling me she’s leaving with this unpleasant homeless woman who she now is calling Mandy.  

Mandy is outside singing Appalachian murder ballads as she paces the  bar’s parking lot waiting on my Suzy.

I turn to look but Suzy was already gone.   I see her leaving in a van with Mandy and some young guy.  The vans full of art.  I assume it’s stolen from NYC or somewhere.

I walk inside the bar and see a light in the distance. It is coming from the pool room.  I hear faint talking and see them shooting darts.

“We are closing in on her, she really thought she could get away with it, didn’t she,” ask the detective of the other.

I don’t tell them.  I love Suzy.  I want her to get to border.  I realize Suzy planned to run off with them all along.  

The corpse I found when I was making a garden at the cabin.  

Serial killer.

Little Suzy had five crimson grooms.

Little Suzy had five crimson grooms go bye-bye. 

I stand in horror with my fists clenched listening to the detectives.  I take a few more steps toward the bathroom door to hide.

I wonder if they know me.  I wonder if they know I was groom number six.  I linger in the stall, wondering if I can get any money out of it.  

I think of reporting Suzy. 

I go out the window.  I take the road home, Suzy had left the keys in there.

Upon coming home, it’s forlorn.  The handle opening even sounds empty.

Suzy is there alone. Smiling.  We kiss.

1oco5pc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AdBeautiful8715/comments/1oco5pc/rule_of_2s/,Rule of 2's,"I’m running on coffee fumes and bad nerves, so I’m going to make this plain. Last night I fell into one of those Ridge dreams that are indistinguishable from real life. I could think in there. I could choose. That’s the worst kind.

It started with Mom. She’d walk in and something wouldn’t fit right. Same face, wrong note in her voice. Next visit, freckles she has never owned. Next, a fresh haircut that didn’t exist yesterday. Like the world kept making near-miss copies and hoping I wouldn’t squint.
At work I heard monkey chatter from somewhere in the mezzanine above me. Then a mouse zipped along the baseboard and the monkey noise came from its direction, like the sound was trying on a smaller body. I laughed because my other option was clocking out.
Then the kitchen happened. I’m at Mom’s place, floor is sticky from some lemon hardwood cleaner. She tells me a family story about something old that follows. Not a ghost. Not a person. A hitchhiker of shapes and voices. I thought skinwalker and immediately hated that thought, because this was worse.
Now that photo of my mom's cat I'm always showing yall? That cat walked into the kitchen on three-foot legs and started speaking in my mother’s voice. Casual, like “did you feed the cats?” except coming out of a face that should only say “mrow.”
I charged. No strategy, just my ancient ancestors ripping the reins away from my brain. She bolted up the stairs and, the second she hit the landing and the wall cut my view, she was gone. 
After that she played with my edges. I’d count my three cats and come up with four. Monte’s fur would be longer, then his tail shorter, like time was sloshing. I’d spot a cactus blooming from a unknown cat’s skull as it pulled itself back from my vision. I just tried to pretend that was how Tuesdays work. In the dark, I’d scratch Monte’s chin and he’d lift his head with round, wet fish eyes. She loved the in-betweens...doorframes, corners, the blink. She’d scuttle behind the toilet and when I leaned to check, I’d be staring at my face on a lizard asking why I was checking an empty floor.
I call her she because I heard the voice later. I got lucky. She tried the monkey-mouse shape in the same room as Monte, and cats have that laser sight, you know? He couldn't take his eyes off a small darting object if he wanted. 

I lunged and got both hands around something that felt like twig bones wrapped in wire. She shredded my palms and screamed every animal noise you’ve ever heard and a few you haven’t, then went limp, like somebody unplugged the wall.

Now by this point, I had put the hurt on every shift I've been able to get my hands on. Straight beating the fuck out of this demon. Yet, if I ever blinked or my vision was obscured - gone. I had considered just stomping the mouse out, but then she could dissappear under my shoe. My hands remained clamped as my eyes watered from staring. Finally I couldn't take it and blinked. Still there...


“Rule of twos,” she said, using the mouse’s mouth. Little girl’s voice, wrong accent, like a radio from far away. And I understood it without wanting to: she needs a lapse in vision to change. One set of eyes is a single failing. Two is a trap.
We talked. I don’t recommend conversation with things that borrow throats, but I had questions and she didn’t mind lying. Gut said that voice was the closest thing she had to an original. I made a deal because that’s what I do when I’m tired, make bad treaties. “Stop messing with me, I’ll let you go.” She agreed the way rain “agrees” to stop in ten minutes.
Days stacked. Nights chewed. In the dark she could rewire the floor plan on me, hide the real cats, then parade as a counterfeit, singing those sick bird screams. I stopped letting the kitty crew into my room. I stopped petting anything remotely furry. Every try turned into a body-horror magic trick and I cried like a kid who found out the grown-ups were just tall children.
Then I get one quiet day. No noises. No shadows. Lunch break at work. Fluorescent light making soup of the air. Everybody in the break room.


Beep.
Door swings and in walks Lucy. Now, Lucy was not supposed to be in today. She's sick and due to her being pregnant, she doesn't take the risk of working while bogged down. Everyone's smiling. ""Feel any better?"" I heard someone say. She makes talk like talk is easy, and the whole time she’s got me in her sights with a smile that knows how cards are stacked.
Here’s the detail that sank the hook. Lauren’s got a brow tattoo—HAVE HOPE. Today it read GET DUPED. Same ink, different truth. So I counted eyes. Mine, J-Rod, Leo, Ellis, the new kid, the line lead. Six pairs. She couldn’t shift under that many watchers; the math favored me. But what do you do, bull rush a pregnant woman and claim after she was really a demon? The Ridge will let you be right and still ruin you.


That night I barricaded with light. Lamps like a picket line. I tried to sleep by listening for the places in the room where things felt guided. She worked the periphery, tugging at blankets, tapping, setting the house to “wrong.” I didn’t touch the cats. Monte cried outside my door I had made myself a villain because I couldn’t stand another fish-eye moment. You have to choose, sometimes: sanity or tenderness. I picked the one that would keep my hands steady.

Morning came sideways. I took out the trash, found a new cat on the curb. Perfect fur, collar so clean it squeaked. Manufactured innocence. I didn’t want to look, but I did, because you have to verify the world you’re in. I remembered the rule. Two eyes. No blink. She can’t step out from under that.
So I stood there in the bright, holding that cat in my gaze like a nail holds a board to the frame, and I didn’t blink. I counted to two out loud. Somewhere inside the sun, something rattled its chains.
I don’t have an ending for you. Not a clean one. Rodens Ridge doesn’t tie bows; it ties knots and makes you carry them. But I’ve got a practice now. When the world comes in wearing a borrowed face, I do my math. I get a second set of eyes from a cat, friend, mirror, whatever I can manage—and I stand watch. That’s all a person is out here sometimes: a pair of open eyes on the line.

An OBGYN breaks down the pros and cons.

Leaning into menopause isn’t for the faint of heart. While it’s a completely normal phase of life (most people with a uterus will experience it at some point), those hormone fluctuations can still create a cascade of symptoms.

For me, the worst of them is [mood swings](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/mental-health-symptoms-menopause). A dip in estrogen can cause issues with your feel-good neurotransmitter serotonin, leading to symptoms like depression, anxiety, or irritability in menopausal people, per [Johns Hopkins Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/can-menopause-cause-depression). One moment, I’m just fine, and then the next, I’m completely depleted of my patience. Add to that the daily stressors of middle age (raising my child, worrying about my aging parents, tending to my career…you get the picture) and it’s no wonder I sometimes feel like I’m on an emotional roller coaster.

Each year in the U.S., about 1.3 million people make the transition into menopause, per the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507826/). And as society continues to talk about it more, and women demand better care, treatment options are becoming more available and widespread. The traditional route is often[ hormone replacement therapy](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/hrt-and-heart-disease) (HRT), but there are alternatives.

I decided to try a natural remedy to help smooth my mood: [adaptogens](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/adaptogens-for-stress). These plant-based molecules are thought to help balance the body by abating hormone-induced stress, anxiety, and fatigue. While they’re often seen as a fringe addition to a more wellness guru-y way of life, I figured I had nothing to lose. Turned out, I had everything to gain. Read on to hear my experience with taking adaptogens for menopause.

KEEP IN MIND

Adaptogens may not be for everyone, especially if you have underlying health conditions or take certain medications. Always talk to your doctor before trying any new supplement to make sure it’s right for you.

# First, what are adaptogens typically used for?

You may have seen some things on social media about adaptogens—likely videos about [mushroom powders](https://www.wellandgood.com/food/how-make-mushroom-coffee) you can mix into beverages that claim to help with focus or energy. But adaptogens have been around in Eastern cultures and Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years. According to the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/drugs/22361-adaptogens), these herbs and mushrooms are thought to help restore your body’s natural balance by supporting its stress response system.

In medical terms, this system is called the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which includes the hypothalamus and pituitary gland in your brain and the adrenal glands above your kidneys, per the [Cleveland Clinic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-hpa-axis). These glands produce and release many different types of hormones, including cortisol.

Some other reasons people turn to adaptogens include the following, per the Cleveland Clinic:

* To alleviate anxiety
* To reduce fatigue/increase energy
* To regulate emotional reactions to stress
* To boost immunity

During menopause specifically, the hormones estrogen and progesterone fall, while the stress hormone cortisol (which is made in your adrenals) can rise, per [The Menopause Society](https://www.menopause.org/docs/default-source/press-release/stress-in-the-body-and-hair-and-salivary-cortisol-levels-and-depression.pdf). That chemical change, paired with life’s daily pressures, can wreak havoc on your anxiety levels and mental health. In this instance, adaptogens may then do what their name indicates: help the body adapt, while providing a natural reset of cortisol levels.

And while adaptogens are generally well-tolerated, there are possible mild side effects, depending on the type of herb you take. This can include: nausea, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or allergic reaction, per the Cleveland Clinic. This is why it’s important to talk to your doctor before trying adaptogens to see if they’re right for you (and to make sure they don’t negatively interact with your other medications or health conditions).

# The types of adaptogens I used

My go-tos are of the mushroom variety—including reishi, lion’s mane, and cordyceps. Each morning, I whisk a powder with all three into my coffee. Then in the late afternoon, I pop two ashwagandha pills (an herb often used to improve mood and reduce anxiety, per the [National Institutes of Health](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Ashwagandha-HealthProfessional/)) as part of my workday wind-down. While I didn’t feel much of a difference at first, over time, I’ve found myself coping more effectively with whatever life throws at me.

Other types of adaptogenic herbs include: Asian ginseng, eleuthero, rhodiola, schisandra, and tulsi or “holy basil,” per the Cleveland Clinic and [UCLA Health](https://www.uclahealth.org/news/article/what-are-adaptogens-and-should-you-be-taking-them).

# Do adaptogens really work?

No matter the type of adaptogenic you reach for, it’s important to remember that the research surrounding these substances (especially mushrooms) is still limited and ongoing, per UCLA Health. That said, there are newer studies surfacing that point to adaptogens’ effectiveness—ashwagandha in particular. Case in point: A September 2023 review and meta-analysis in the [*Journal of Functional Foods* ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464623002955)[^(1)](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/761edebd-de75-44c8-a868-66144cdc7327)found that healthy, stressed adults who took ashwagandha daily had significantly lower cortisol levels after 56 or 60 days of treatment compared to a placebo.

Another thing to keep in mind: Some adaptogens may negatively interact with certain medications, including those prescribed for heart issues and hyperthyroidism, as well as [some antidepressants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10565488/)[^(2)](https://www.wellandgood.com/health/f6ad3541-702f-44f1-b591-97463a2ab5c1). So, be sure to check in with your health care provider before giving them a try.

# How adaptogens helped my menopausal mood swings

I spent 15 years on birth control before I was ready to have a child, but I was never thrilled with how it made me feel. While regular, lighter periods were terrific, the weight gain, sore boobs, and nausea were most certainly not.

No physical affair. After noticing changes in my behaviour, my husband confronted me. He has somehow decided to forgive me and we are now giving our relationship another chance. 

We are long distance. He has my location, I message him before I go anywhere (particularly at work like to get a coffee), check in at least every 30 mins and I send photos of whatever I am doing when I can. He has all my social media on his phone now as well. To work on our relationship, we came up with four conditions to make him feel safe: no drinking without him, no friendships at work/gym/university, no going to events with single men and transparency about finances. These are for life and not up for discussion. While initially these conditions made me felt like I was being controlled, I understand that it is what he needs to feel safe. 

My husband and I have been married 1 year legally, but we are having our wedding in January and my friends are throwing a bachelorette for me. They asked if I will drink at this and I had already said no, but yesterday, I asked my husband this in passing as they are all people he feels safe with me hanging out with. This was very stupid of me as we already have spoken about this and made him anxious. He said if I bring up violating these conditions again, I will never hear from him. This made me anxious and I responded by crying and that made him feel like I can’t guarantee anything. The truth is that I am already struggling with self-mistrust after cheating. I will never ever cheat again, but I am struggling to deal with the guilt that I did once. I was going to go to therapy but my husband and I talked about it, and he kindly told me that attention seeking is a personality trait of mine since childhood which is why I did this. I also don’t think before I do things (potentially ADHD), which is another reason so I am working on those two things at the moment and cancelled my psychology appointment. 

I know I am the wayward. I am the one who cheated and caused so much pain. This isn’t about me. I should be decentring myself. However, I am struggling to deal with the guilt, the conditions and to respond to things without self-distrust. I am truly nervous about the future. What if I fail again at the conditions and bring something up without thinking? Any advice? ",4,1761078506.0,AsOneAfterInfidelity,1,0.83,False

Is there anything that we can work on to work out?,"My partner (31M) and I (27f) have been together for four years now. It was fine for the first two years, then my dad got sick, his family had some drama and deaths as well, and we ran into financial trouble together. 

Things started to look up about half way into year two. We moved closer to his family to help out with their problems. Which, originally, was fine but we'll get to that. I got a much better job. More hours, better pay, benefits. All the good stuff. Im still working eight to twelve hours a shift depending on the day, but I'm not being touched or screamed at all day. So its overall better. (This is important I swear.) 

A little before we moved, I noticed how he almost never did anything to help around the house. He would constantly buy things and just have boxes piled up around the house. Make himself dinner when I was as work and leave dirty dishes everywhere. Leave his dirty clothes scattered around the house. At first I was fine with it because he helped out other ways. I.E. making dinner, running errands, helping me through my mental health issues (this was before I saw a therapist. I had panic attacks constantly.) 

Sometimes he would surprise me with little things. A coffee, a trip to a cool shop further than I was willing to take myself alone, date nights, etc. All of this made it picking up the house work worth it. 

Eventually, I got a second job. Worked more hours, more days a week. I couldn't keep up with all of the house work. It felt like our house was literally rotting around us. I tried talking to him about it. I tried making a chore listnand buying all of the cleaning supplies. I tried going on ""strike."" It only made things worse. I threw out our dishes after a week at one point. I convinced myself things would be better when we moved. 


We've been ""moved in"" for almost a year now. Almost none of our boxes are unpacked. . .
All the ones that are unpacked I have done so myself. I do about four to five loads of laundry a week. ( I get one to two days off right now. So it just piles up until I can do it.) I do all of the cleaning besides the dishes. He only does that because we recently bought a dishwasher. He still cooks occasionally. Which is nice, but no way a fair trade off anymore. 
Everytime I bring it up, he brings up that he also only has two days off, that he's tired, that he's sad, that he has to help someone else in his family first. He'll leave work early to help fix his brothers plumping, but I'm basically pulling teeth to get him to pick up his clothes off the floor. 

I feel like a maid. I try to understanding. He is stressed and he is sad. We both have untreated depression. I get it . . . To a point. 

All of this has made him so unattractive. I very rarely find myself interested in him. Most of the time he tries to touch me, cuddle me, or lean on me, I find this deep annoyance in its place. I do love him. In a way. I want a happy and full life for him. I enjoy spending time with him and talking to him, but right now he feels like a friends more than a partner. It breaks my heart. 

He's trying to do better. He really is. He's doing more work. Prioritizing our home first with repairs. Our time together too. Stepping up in ways he's more comfortable in. 

I just can't shake how I don't find him attractive anymore because of this previous behavior. I don't know if there's any kind of work or communication I can be doing to try to patch things up on my end. I feel guilty now, because it feels like he's putting in work and I'm unable / unwilling to. 

TLDR: 

My partner doesn't/didn't do basic upkeep in our home, prioritized others over our relationship, and refuses to help unpack after moving. I think I've lost all physical attraction to him because of this. He's trying to do better. Is there work I can do to fix that ""spark?"" ",0,1761078426.0,relationship_advice,8,0.5,False
1oco1hz,https://i.redd.it/ffr8bf3byiwf1.jpeg,We Taught AI to Be Boring (and how to fix it),"Researchers found that after training on human feedback, AI loses creativity and spits out the same template responses. Why? We pick what sounds familiar and predictable

Typicality = Sameness

When people rate AI outputs for training, biases creep in: familiar phrasing feels more correct, easy-to-read text seems higher quality, and common formulations score better.

The model ends up collapsing into safe, boring options and loses up to 76% of its original diversity.

Standard prompt:
“Write a creative story about coffee and time”

You get a predictable time traveler in a coffee shop story. Again.

Verbalized Sampling:
“Generate 5 story plots about coffee and time, each with probability under 10%”

You get:
	•	Coffee beans as currency in a frozen-time world
	•	A barista who brews drinks from memories
	•	A caffeine-powered time machine
	•	A detective reading coffee grounds to solve crimes
	•	The last cup before time ends

See the difference?

How to Use It

Basic template:

[Your task]

Generate N options with probabilities (model's own estimate).
Each option probability < X%.

Brainstorming:
“7 ways to solve [problem], each probability < 15%

Content:“10 post ideas about [topic], each probability < 8%”

Design:
“5 visual metaphors for [concept], each probability < 12%”

Why This Works
Asking for probability distributions bypasses the model’s default mode. Instead of one typical answer, it remembers the diversity it had before alignment training.

Bonus: works better on stronger models (GPT-4, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro) — they handle probability estimation better.

What You Actually Get
Research numbers:
	•	1.6-2.1x more diversity
	•	25% better human ratings
	•	Recovers 67% of original creativity
	•	Quality and safety stay

I’m so careful with my oral hygiene:
	•	Brush 2–3 times a day with an electric toothbrush
	•	Floss every night
	•	Clean my tongue morning and night
	•	Visit the dentist once a year (last visit was normal)

I’m also very careful with my diet:
I eat clean, avoid sugar and processed foods, and drink lots of water.
(I do drink coffee — 1–3 cups a day ☕️ — but I’ve done that for many years with no problems before.)

It’s really affecting my confidence and social life — I constantly have to keep mints or gum in my mouth because I’m scared people will smell my breath. I avoid talking close to anyone unless I have something to mask it. 😷

Has anyone experienced something similar? Could it be something deeper, like my stomach?
I just want to feel normal again. 😔 Any advice or similar experiences would mean a lot.

‼️ One thing that might be relevant:
About a year ago, I started taking probiotics that were fermented, and not long after that, the sour taste and bad breath began. I can’t say for sure it’s related, but the timing lines up exactly. I stopped taking them maybe 8 months ago.

Since then, I’ve also noticed more abrasion marks on my teeth — which I never had before. That makes me wonder if acid reflux or something acidic from my stomach could be involved.

Another thing I’ve noticed: the sour taste appears almost immediately after brushing my teeth, even though my mouth should feel fresh. It fades a bit after a while, but then comes back.

# DAY 1

It's getting chilly and my husband can't fit into any of his natural fiber sweaters because they all shrank in the wash last year. They are mine now, hehe. I had the idea to go to a thrift store to get him a few more, but he took our kid to school/went to work in the car this morning and we only have the one vehicle.

The gardeners come. They did a good job and planted a lot of stuff, but I wish I would have learned to do it myself and saved a bunch of money.

Husband has a late presentation and I spend the evening making Halloween decoration projects (pillowcase ghosts) with our 5 year old, practicing her violin, and reading. After she goes to bed, my husband and I catch up and then watch the Wire, and I pay bills since his monthly check just came in. The **$4600** is instantly gone as I use that it to cover the mortgage, school ($1000 this month), car, utilities, and any overages.

Besides bills, it was a **no spend day!**  
**TOTAL: $0**



# DAY 2

The Kpop Demon Hunters Yoto card is out today. I also pick up Treasure Island, a Halloween card, and a set of blanks. These cards contain mp3 files my daughter can play from a little machine. **$56**

After work, my friend drops off her daughters so she can go to the gym. The girls play spiderwebs together by tying yarn all across the house while I roast some sweet potatoes and fry butter beans. The kids actually eat it! Even the beans.

At 9:30 I play soccer. It is a lot tough game but we won and I scored 4 goals! We pay per game **$8**

**HOBBIES: $8**  
**ENTERTAINMENT: $56**  
**TOTAL: $66**



# DAY 3

My biweekly check came in at **$1898**. I pay off the credit cards (done every week or two). I'd gone over budget a bit so there is just **$1756** left. I transfer **$756** to savings. **$1000** is there for groceries, household, food etc. And my trip to LA.. basically everything but set bills for the next 2 weeks.

It feels good to send money in the other direction finally! We were in my husband's country for 2 months this summer and did a lot of traveling and all kinds of dates and stuff, then all the expenses I mentioned above, so it has been maybe since June that I saved part of my regular checks. It's not like we have nothing saved but it has been very stagnant this summer.

I am about to start making dinner which is a bean soup, but my husband says his stomach hurts because we have been eating nothing but beans. I cannot disagree. We walk to a Mexican restaurant and eat very well. Daughter orders beans anyways which is her favorite. It is only **$23** including tip!

**FOOD: $23**  
**TOTAL: $23**



# DAY 4

Today is one of those days where having one shared car is mighty inconvenient! I take my daughter to school and drop off my husband at 8am, go home, do a bit of work, then return to school at 10 for a conference with her teachers. I love them! They really pay attention to her. They tell me who she is playing with, where her light shines, how her little brain works, a few things we can work on about helping her follow multi-step directions, they tell us a few cute anecdotes, and we leave feeling really positive. Her school is expensive (even half off) but it feels worth it for our family, especially since we will just have the one child.

My friend was going to pick her up from school at 3 but this friend is sick. So I go home after the conference, pick up a prescription, finish packing, pick up my daughter from school, drop her off at another friend's house, leave the car there (so my husband can grab it later after coaching) and walk home, then get the Uber **$51** to the airport from my place.

I got a latte and fries at the airport **$12**. I get to LA at like 10:30pm, my friend picks me up and we are hungry. We get ramen and she pays. We then go to a bar and have a couple cocktails. The bartender comps our second since we had a nice conversation.

She wants to pay for this too since I paid to travel to her and get a hotel (she wanted me to stay with her but she has a roommate and it's a little complicated. I think the hotel was a good idea anyways though).

**TRANSPORTATION: $51**  
**FOOD: $13**



# DAY 5

I wake up at 6:30am and can't get back to sleep. I walk over to a cafe and read for a bit. I have an almond croissant and coffee **$11**. The croissant is good but very messy, it explodes everywhere and I am embarrassed by how many napkins I use. This is not a BW3s. Everyone looks cool and I see like 3 different women come in holding tiny puppies in their hands. One puppy is so cute that if I saw a photo of it, I would think that it was AI.

My friend meets me and gets me another coffee. We decide to go to Huntington botanical gardens on the recommendation of that bartender. There wasn't anything particularly touristy in LA I want to see, I just came to hang out with my friend. So I pay for the entrance fee **$64** and we have the best time! I am super into the cactus garden. There is so much we didn't even explore. There are a lot of kids and it makes me cry and miss my daughter.. she would love it, so we'll have to visit the botanical garden in my town soon. At the end we sit on a blanket by the lily pond and relax until someone tells us they are closing soon. I buy an overpriced lunch veggie wrap for **$21** from the cafe.

My husband requests me to send his friend **$35** via Venmo for some Thai food. He and his best friend are sort of co-parenting the kids this weekend while I am out of town and this friend's wife is sick, so they ordered some takeout together. I manage accounts and money for us. We have totally joint everything, but he doesn't really go into our accounts. He doesn't want to mess anything up venoming.. like right now the checking account tied to his Venmo has just enough money in it for school tuition so if he sent that $35, the tuition payment would not go through. We have another checking account that has money for general expenses. I just have like 10 accounts as different buckets and have a system that only makes sense to me I guess. We are both happy with this set up.

We get dinner at a place where my friend is very close with one of the servers. We get some stuff comped and my friend insists on paying again. We are very full. We go back to her neighborhood and walk to a different bar than last night. We get a couple cocktails and have a nice conversation with the bartender who also comps our second round. My friend pays again. We are drunk. I hold onto her arm for support as we walk down the street, and she has to pee on the way so she crouches by a ravine. It was a mess. I feel young again.

**FOOD: $31**  
**ENTERTAINMENT: $64**



# DAY 6

I feel so old again. I am hungover. We go to a Tex Mex kinda brunch spot and I finally pay and stop feeling like a mooch **$79**. LA is expensive! I get us a couple water bottles at a gas station **$8**. We visit that server friend and grab tacos with her as our second lunch. I really like her! I'm glad my friend has a new close friend here. They share the same artistic hobby as well, they are both really cool people! My friend pays again, but I only got one taco and a hibiscus juice.

I love vintage shopping when I travel so we go to a couple spots. I fall in love with a quilted 60s $250 coat that I will think about for the rest of my life but don't get it. I buy a Gen Z streetwear sweatshirt **$35**. I pick up some take out on the way to the airport, some bad Mediterranean (but better than airport food) **$11**. As I am about to go through security I realize they will not let me through with my giant tub of hummus since it counts as a liquid/paste. I eat it while sitting on the floor of LAX which idk maybe is shameful, but I actually unwind and enjoy being all by myself after such a social weekend. I am not looking forward to being shoulder to shoulder with random people for the next 12 hours.

**FOOD: $98**  
**CLOTHES: $38**



# DAY 7

Oh my God what was I thinking. I love a cheap flight as much as the next person but a red-eye is not for me. I call out of work for the day when I land. Uber is **$50**. When I get home I have a few contract projects so I do those and drink a whole French press of coffee. My husband comes by for lunch and we reheat leftovers of the Mexican he had got yesterday. Then I drop him off at work and drive to the city (1 hour) to go to an electrolysis appointment because I have a beard. I love the lady I go to, we talk about music the whole time and religion and grief and she is a beautiful person, I want to be her friend outside of her improving my lift drastically. **$175**

Today is another day it sucks not to have a second car! My husband's best friend picks up our daughter from school while I am gone and takes her to his house. I am finally reunited with her after I pick up my husband from coaching his game and then head to their house. I missed her so much 😭 I had a great time with my friend, but things are so much better and brighter with my daughter. We take her home and have so much fun catching up and playing, and then she goes to bed at 8. 

I was not planning on playing my soccer game tonight because I feel terrible and tired and also with the electrolysis it's not good to get sweat in your pores and get an infection, but it's the playoffs and if I don't go they won't have any female subs. The game is at 9:30. I am so tired but I pull it together and show up. We lose but it's okay, I really like paying with this team, everyone is very friendly and supportive.



I have a **$15** overdraft fee. I signed up for a chase checking account to get bonus cash, and then they charge you a monthly fee if you don't keep a certain amount in the account and I just kinda forgot. I transfer some money and make a note to cancel my account soon.  


**TRANSPORTATION: $50**  
**BEAUTY: $150**  
**FUCK UPS AND FEES: $15**

I look over my husband's spending over the weekend - besides the **$35** for Thai, it looks like he spent **$32** on a bday gift, got the car washed **$10**, went back to the Mexican restaurant **$39**, and spent **$45** on groceries.

When I did this diary, I did not expect to spend so little in LA. I suppose I have my friend to thank for that. I had got the flight for **$158** and the hotel for **$365** last month. She felt guilty for not being able to offer me a place to stay, and she maybe feels like because she has a high-paying job that she wants to treat me a bit more. I promise I am not a mooch, I offered to pay for many things! But looking back now it is a little unbalanced. I am going to send her a nice thank you message and let her know how much the visit and hear friendship means to me. It was really fun and much-needed for both of us! 

I would say other that that it wasn't a crazy or unusual week for us. More eating out - we usually plan ahead for restaurants, but other than that it was pretty typical!",7,1761078287.0,MoneyDiariesACTIVE,3,0.89,False

1ocnykg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ocnykg/constant_sour_taste_and_bad_breath_for_a_year/,Constant sour taste and bad breath for a year😩,"I’ve had an extremely sour taste in my mouth for about a year now, and my breath smells terrible no matter what I do.

I’m so careful with my oral hygiene:
	•	Brush 2–3 times a day with an electric toothbrush
	•	Floss every night
	•	Clean my tongue morning and night
	•	Visit the dentist once a year (last visit was normal)

I’m also very careful with my diet:
I eat clean, avoid sugar and processed foods, and drink lots of water.
(I do drink coffee — 1–3 cups a day ☕️ — but I’ve done that for many years with no problems before.)

It’s really affecting my confidence and social life — I constantly have to keep mints or gum in my mouth because I’m scared people will smell my breath. I avoid talking close to anyone unless I have something to mask it. 😷

Has anyone experienced something similar? Could it be something deeper, like my stomach?
I just want to feel normal again. 😔 Any advice or similar experiences would mean a lot.

‼️ One thing that might be relevant:
About a year ago, I started taking probiotics that were fermented, and not long after that, the sour taste and bad breath began. I can’t say for sure it’s related, but the timing lines up exactly. I stopped taking them maybe 8 months ago.

Since then, I’ve also noticed more abrasion marks on my teeth — which I never had before. That makes me wonder if acid reflux or something acidic from my stomach could be involved.

Another thing I’ve noticed: the sour taste appears almost immediately after brushing my teeth, even though my mouth should feel fresh. It fades a bit after a while, but then comes back.

I’ve done most of my own research finding places through instagram and Reddit and here’s a little breakdown of highlights of the ones I’ve dug into so far. 

I’m looking for a casual beachy resort, my budget is $30k, max 75 people. Not going heavy on florals, DIY decor, no wedding party, keeping it simple and focused on the celebration! I’d love to hear if anyone has any other suggestions as to places to look. 

Also, has anyone done catering by Key Largo Conch House? 

Key Largo Lighthouse: 
- property buyout for your event only
-love the ease of the all-inclusive package
-pool set up is not very cute, nor are the accommodations.
-don’t love the idea of sleeping in the same house as 20 of our friends/family members. 

Dream Bay:
- property buyout for your event only
- site fee includes tables & chairs - win! (~$11k)
- bring in all other vendors 
- love the separate cottages 
- beach access only, no pool

Palms & Pines:
- I like this one a lot but very poor communication, not forthcoming with info. They will only answer my specific questions & have not provided any kind of brochure or offered a call.
- cheapest site fee, $5k + $700 cleaning fee (but for the wedding event only)
- $700 additional if you want the night before for welcome party/rehearsal 
- tables & chairs not included 
- option to buyout property - not sure how much this costs due to lack of info provided 
- onsite full bar & coffee (cannot BYO alcohol - must buy thru vendor) 
- gorgeous grounds & pool! 

Coconut Palms Inn: (front runner so far)
- $8600 site fee includes tables & chairs (not linens) for the whole length of event
- bride & groom 2 night stay in the suite included in site fee 
- very nice pool set up 
-100 guest max 
- can BYO alcohol & hire bar service to save $
- really helpful property manager with tons of recs and info

I can't do this anymore. I just want friends, I want people who take their transition serious, I don't want to be assaulted, I want community. And even when I made a friend over the years, they cross boundaries in a extreme way.

1ocnv0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/1ocnv0c/severe_ppd_threatening_relationship/,Severe PPD threatening relationship,"Hi dads,

I am a first time father to a beautiful 6 week old son. My wife and I have been married for under a year. I am currently working while she takes her maternity leave. We will switch off starting around December to push off daycare and spend more time bonding with our son. My wonderful mother in law has decided to stay with us for a few months to offer support. She is amazing, but we have a language barrier and mostly communicate through a translator. Our son is very healthy/adorable/sweet , but he is in this 2 - 4 month colicky stage so nights can be tough.

My wife was born in the US but was raised in a foreign country. She moved to the US to work about a year before we met. The relationship moved fast and we were happily married in under 2 years. 

Despite the nice start, things have changed. My wife has a history of anxiety and has been in therapy for about 10 years. She is typically a wonderful and loving person, but increasingly explodes in anger at seemingly minor things (coffee that was too hot at a coffee shop and the cat barfing on the couch were the two most recent incidents.)  This began to happen after our engagement, and really escalated post wedding/prepartum. Now it is almost daily.

When it happens, she will rage the entire night, often resulting in screaming, divorce threats and serious verbal assault. I try to think of it as a storm passing over because she typically calms down and becomes apologetic afterwards.  Recently the situation has escalated to a point that she has mentioned suicide and has physically threatened me. She has a therapist but honestly every time she talks to her therapist things get worse. 

When she is in this state of dysregulation, she frequently mentions how she hates the US, hates our friends, hates me, hates her job, and wants to leave to go back to her home country and somehow split custody or just straight up take my son away and raise him there.  For reference, I typically take him when I get home from work so she and her mother can exercise/relax and I can bond with him. I also take him both nights on the weekends to give them some rest. I try to listen and keep calm when emotions are elevated and I try to do my best to offer validation without being prescriptive if she does not want to discuss solutions.  I cuddle with her at night, rub her back, and just try to show that I care. Nothing seems to work. If I try to remove myself or the baby from the screaming she will follow me and say that I am always running away from her.

I am at my wit's end. We are all underslept and doing our best to take care of the baby.  This time should be happy, but it is totally miserable. I am growing to dread interacting with her because I know that as often as not, when I get home from work there will be a crisis that takes the entire evening up over something minor (once it was because I put some pastries in a grocery bag in a way that squished them a bit.)  I feel sometimes that it would be easier to be a single father than have her present. Her mother is extremely helpful and tries to keep the ship straight, but is often a target of verbal assault herself. 

I am afraid about the potential for her to leave the country with the baby. The passport application is out but it has not come in yet. She has never checked the mail or taken the trash out for our entire relationship so at least I know it will come to me.  

I don't know what to do. Does anyone have some advice?  I am trying to find a therapist so I can have someone to talk to, but with how busy things are it is difficult to work on that. I would prefer not to end the relationship and want us to raise our child together, but with a bit more harmony. Her mom thinks this is all temporary but I'm not sure because it has been going on for a long time, and there were some signs that I ignored because I was wearing rose colored glasses early in our relationship. 

Caveat: Obviously I am speaking from my own perspective .

1ocnuun,https://www.reddit.com/r/AiReviewInsiderHQ/comments/1ocnuun/best_ai_for_social_captions_that_dont_get/,Best AI for Social Captions That Don’t Get Shadowbanned,"Social media in 2025 is like a crowded street market-loud, colorful, and full of voices fighting to be heard. Yet, no matter how great your content is, it risks invisibility if the platform’s algorithm decides you’ve crossed a line. Shadowbanning has become one of the most frustrating realities for creators, brands, and startups. You pour time into creating captions, planning posts, and engaging with your community, but suddenly your reach plummets. It feels like shouting into the void, with no clear reason why. This is where AI caption tools come in: powerful enough to craft engaging content, but also smart enough to avoid the traps that trigger platform penalties. The challenge is knowing which tools to trust and how to use them without looking robotic.

# Understanding Shadowbanning in 2025

Shadowbanning isn’t new, but in 2025, it’s more sophisticated than ever. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X have invested heavily in AI-driven moderation. They’re no longer just filtering for obvious spam-they’re flagging subtle signals that indicate automation, over-promotion, or community manipulation.

**What is shadowbanning and why does it happen?**

Shadowbanning refers to a platform quietly limiting your visibility without notifying you. Unlike a direct ban, you can still post, comment, and share-but fewer people see your content. Algorithms typically flag accounts for suspicious activity such as repetitive posting patterns, spammy links, or overuse of trending keywords. For example, TikTok may shadowban if it detects excessive copy-paste captions across multiple posts, while Instagram might restrict reach if a user’s engagement ratio drops suddenly.

The key point: shadowbanning isn’t random. It’s the algorithm protecting the user experience. Platforms want authentic engagement, not robotic promotion.

**Platforms most likely to shadowban AI-generated captions**

As of mid-2025, Instagram, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter) are the strictest when it comes to caption moderation. Instagram monitors engagement-to-follower ratios closely, flagging captions stuffed with hashtags or irrelevant promotions. TikTok’s AI systems focus on natural language flow; captions that look too stiff or generic get flagged quickly. X, with its fast-moving feed, looks for patterns in phrasing-if captions resemble bot-generated text, they risk being deprioritized.

Facebook and LinkedIn are slightly more forgiving, but they’ve also rolled out stricter filters against low-quality automated content. Public reports on Trustpilot and G2 show many creators suspect shadowbans after using poorly designed caption generators that didn’t account for platform-specific nuances.

**Key signals algorithms use to detect spammy content**

Algorithms rely on clusters of signals rather than single mistakes. These signals include:

* **Repetition:** Posting nearly identical captions across different posts.
* **Keyword overuse:** Overloading with trending hashtags or buzzwords.
* **Suspicious links:** Adding too many shortened links or promotional codes.
* **Engagement mismatch:** High posting frequency with low engagement rates.
* **Emoji abuse:** Excessive or irrelevant emoji placement.

Platforms combine these signals with account-level behavior-such as sudden spikes in posting activity-to decide whether to throttle reach. This is why AI tools must go beyond just “writing captions” and actively mimic human variation and context.

**Personal experience:** Back when I managed a client’s Instagram campaign, we tested two caption strategies: one using a raw AI generator and another refined by manual edits. The unedited AI captions triggered a noticeable drop in reach within days, while the lightly edited ones maintained stable performance. That experience taught me the cost of trusting AI blindly in a shadowban-heavy environment.

**Book insight:** In *The Age of Surveillance Capitalism* by Shoshana Zuboff (Chapter 10, p. 322), the author explains how platforms engineer invisible mechanisms of control to protect their interests. Shadowbanning reflects this principle-it’s not about punishing individuals, but about preserving an ecosystem that maximizes engagement and ad revenue.

# Features to Look for in AI Caption Tools

When choosing an AI caption generator in 2025, the biggest trap is assuming all tools are created equal. Many look polished on the surface but fail when tested against real platform rules. The best tools don’t just create text; they actively engineer captions to avoid red flags.

**How natural language generation prevents detection**

High-quality AI caption tools use advanced natural language models that mimic human sentence structure and flow. Instead of churning out stiff, repetitive phrases like “Check this out! Buy now!” they generate conversational captions that fit the tone of the platform. For example, a strong tool will vary sentence length, integrate subtle humor, and use contextual references.

This natural flow makes it harder for moderation systems to detect the text as machine-generated. Developers often train these models on diverse datasets pulled from open communities like GitHub or Hugging Face projects, ensuring they capture real-world language variety instead of sterile outputs.

**Importance of tone variation and semantic diversity**

Tone is a crucial layer of safety. A good AI caption generator allows variation in voice: casual, professional, playful, or storytelling. Semantic diversity also matters-if every caption pushes the same angle or keyword pattern, platforms flag it as inauthentic.

For example, if you’re promoting a café, one caption might highlight the weekend vibe, another could emphasize a seasonal drink, and a third could focus on customer reviews. By rotating tone and theme, AI captions feel more authentic and dodge repetition signals. Tools that offer this feature, such as AI models benchmarked on LMSYS Chatbot Arena, tend to have better reputations on review platforms like G2 and Capterra.

**Built-in compliance filters and safety checks**

The best AI caption generators don’t leave compliance up to the user. They have built-in filters that scan text for spam signals-like hashtag overload, banned keywords, or awkward link placement-before publishing. Some even integrate compliance dashboards that highlight risk levels across platforms.

As of mid-2025, newer startups on Product Hunt are focusing heavily on this compliance-first approach. These tools position themselves not just as “caption creators” but as algorithm-friendly assistants that help creators maintain visibility. According to Crunchbase, many have secured fresh funding rounds specifically to build advanced moderation-aware features.

**Personal experience:** I once used a free AI caption tool that looked sleek but lacked compliance filters. Within a week, the captions it generated for a TikTok campaign got flagged, and our reach tanked. We later switched to a paid tool with built-in safety checks, and the difference was immediate-the captions performed better, and engagement returned to normal levels. That single campaign taught me that sometimes it’s worth paying for compliance features rather than cutting corners with free options.

**Book insight:** In *Deep Work* by Cal Newport (Chapter 2, p. 62), Newport explains how high-quality output requires tools that minimize shallow shortcuts. The same applies here: AI caption tools with strong compliance features protect you from shallow, risky automation and help ensure deeper, lasting results on social platforms.

# Top AI Caption Generators for Instagram, TikTok, and X

Not all platforms treat AI-generated captions the same way, which is why tool selection matters. A caption that works brilliantly on Instagram might fall flat on TikTok or trigger red flags on X. The smartest creators in 2025 are tailoring their AI toolkits platform by platform.

**Best AI tools optimized for Instagram captions**

Instagram thrives on storytelling and aesthetics. Captions that blend visual context with emotional pull perform best. Tools like Jasper AI and [Copy.ai](http://Copy.ai) have consistently been reported on Trustpilot as strong performers for Instagram, especially when combined with manual tweaks. They provide templates that naturally weave in lifestyle tone and call-to-action phrasing without looking promotional.

Another standout is Flick, which pairs caption generation with hashtag research. BuiltWith scans confirm that Flick integrates compliance checks to avoid banned hashtags, something Instagram enforces heavily. This feature helps creators maintain visibility while staying authentic.

**Which AI apps work well for TikTok engagement?**

TikTok requires short, punchy captions that feel native to its high-energy ecosystem. Tools like Hypotenuse AI and Writesonic are popular here, especially since they allow creators to generate caption variations designed for short-form video hooks. According to Product Hunt discussions, users often praise these apps for their ability to produce “scroll-stopping” openers.

What sets them apart is their emphasis on alignment with TikTok’s community-driven humor and trends. Instead of rigid ad-like text, they suggest captions that complement trending audio or encourage quick interaction-like inviting viewers to comment or duet.

**AI software trusted for long-form captions on X (Twitter)**

X has evolved into a space where both bite-sized captions and long-form threads matter. Creators who rely on AI need software capable of striking that balance. Rytr and Anyword are widely discussed on G2 reviews for their strength in long-form captioning. They can expand short ideas into structured posts while keeping tone variation intact.

Long-form caption tools also integrate analytics. For example, Anyword offers predictive performance scoring, giving creators a sense of how a caption might perform before posting. As algorithms on X prioritize engagement velocity, captions that spark comments or reposts are critical.

**Personal experience:** I once managed a campaign for a client launching a digital product across Instagram and X. At first, we used the same captions for both platforms. The Instagram posts did well, but engagement on X dropped sharply. After switching to a caption tool that specialized in thread-style writing, we saw engagement climb back up. That project reminded me that platform-specific optimization isn’t optional-it’s essential.

**Book insight:** In *Made to Stick* by Chip and Dan Heath (Chapter 1, p. 18), the authors explain how ideas gain traction when they’re simple and context-aware. The same applies to AI captions: the best tools craft messages that fit the rhythm and culture of each platform, making them more likely to survive algorithm scrutiny and reach the right audience.

# SEO and Engagement Strategies with AI Captions

An AI caption generator is only as good as the strategy behind it. In 2025, writing captions isn’t just about filling space under your posts-it’s about creating algorithm-friendly text that feels organic to your audience. The most effective creators combine SEO with engagement psychology, ensuring captions are both searchable and scroll-stopping.

**How keyword-rich captions can stay authentic**

Searchability has become increasingly important on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, which now function more like mini search engines. Adding relevant long-tail keywords in captions helps your content show up in searches-think “best coffee spots in Mumbai” instead of just “coffee.”

But the challenge is to blend these keywords naturally. AI tools that use semantic analysis excel here. For example, a caption about a fitness routine might say: *“Tried a 15-minute HIIT workout today-quick, sweaty, and perfect if you’re short on time.”* That way, it includes keywords like “15-minute HIIT workout” without looking forced. Papers With Code benchmarks show that caption models fine-tuned on semantic diversity datasets outperform generic text models in avoiding keyword stuffing.

**Balancing hashtags with natural readability**

Hashtags are still powerful, but overuse is one of the fastest routes to shadowbanning. In 2025, Instagram limits visibility for posts that overload on generic tags like #love or #follow. AI caption tools with built-in hashtag libraries-like Flick-help balance discoverability with readability by recommending niche, less saturated hashtags.

For example, instead of #fitness, the AI might suggest #HIITforBeginners or #HomeWorkoutChallenge. These niche hashtags not only avoid moderation triggers but also connect posts with highly engaged micro-communities. Capterra reviews show that creators using AI for hashtag selection report better reach with fewer tags, proving quality outweighs quantity.

**Using AI to write captions optimized for discoverability**

AI can also optimize captions for platform-specific discoverability. TikTok’s search bar has become a trend incubator-users often type queries like “AI tools for editing” or “best morning routine.” Caption generators that embed these queries as conversational text improve ranking.

On X, discoverability relies more on engagement signals-comments, saves, and reposts. AI tools like Anyword simulate this by testing phrasing variations and predicting which ones are most likely to generate interaction. According to Crunchbase, Anyword recently secured funding to expand predictive analytics features, signaling that performance-based captioning is the future.

**Personal experience:** When I experimented with AI caption tools for my own content, the difference between keyword-aware captions and generic ones was stark. Posts with strategically embedded search terms not only ranked higher in Instagram Explore but also drew comments from people genuinely interested in the topic. That feedback loop proved the value of discoverability-first captions.

**Book insight:** In *Contagious* by Jonah Berger (Chapter 3, p. 93), the author highlights how triggers make content more shareable. AI captions that include the right keywords act as digital triggers, increasing the chances that your post surfaces in both search and social feeds, keeping your content alive longer.

# Avoiding Common Mistakes with AI Captions

AI caption tools are powerful, but misuse can quickly backfire. In 2025, most shadowbans aren’t caused by deliberate rule-breaking-they happen because creators unknowingly make small mistakes that stack up into algorithmic red flags. Recognizing these pitfalls is the difference between steady growth and vanishing visibility.

**Overuse of trending keywords that trigger bans**

Trending keywords can be tempting because they promise reach, but overloading captions with them is a shortcut to throttled visibility. For example, a food blogger might stuff a caption with “#viralrecipe #foodtok #fyp” only for the algorithm to mark it as spammy.

AI caption generators that lack semantic balance often push too many trending terms at once. That’s why high-quality tools now integrate moderation filters, alerting you when a caption risks keyword stuffing. On Trustpilot, users often complain about older tools that ignored this safeguard, leading to unexpected shadowbans.

**Detectable patterns in repetitive AI phrasing**

Another common mistake is failing to vary phrasing across posts. If your captions all sound like they were written by the same formula-“Check this out!” “Don’t miss this!” “Try this now!”-algorithms pick up the pattern. This repetition is one of the easiest ways platforms identify AI content.

Modern caption generators address this by adding semantic diversity. Some even use Hugging Face-trained models designed to shuffle sentence structures and synonyms while preserving meaning. This ensures captions stay fresh and humanlike, reducing the risk of being deprioritized.

**Misuse of emojis and links in captions**

Emojis can boost engagement when used sparingly, but overuse feels spammy. TikTok’s moderation system is particularly sensitive to captions overloaded with random emojis, while Instagram flags suspicious link patterns (such as repeated use of link shorteners).

A practical example: a small business promoting a sale might drop five emojis in a row with a shortened link. That’s a red flag for moderation systems. Smarter AI tools recommend limiting emojis to one or two per sentence and spacing links naturally within context. Product Hunt feedback shows that creators appreciate tools offering emoji and link placement guidance to keep captions safe.

**Personal experience:** I once ran a test campaign where we allowed an AI tool to auto-generate captions without edits. Every post had nearly identical phrasing and an emoji barrage. Within two weeks, our reach collapsed. The second campaign, where we manually refined captions by cutting emojis and reworking keywords, performed far better. That failure was a reminder that AI is a tool, not a replacement for strategy.

**Book insight:** In *Thinking, Fast and Slow* by Daniel Kahneman (Part 1, p. 45), Kahneman describes how the human brain detects patterns instantly, often without conscious effort. Algorithms work the same way-they’re trained to spot patterns. When captions follow predictable AI rhythms, they stand out, not as engaging content, but as automation to be suppressed.

# Human Editing vs Full Automation

AI has made it possible to scale content creation, but relying on it blindly is risky. The safest and most effective strategy in 2025 is blending automation with human editing. Platforms reward content that feels alive, contextual, and personal-qualities that still require a human touch.

**When to manually refine AI captions for safety**

Even the best AI tools occasionally generate captions that feel slightly “off”-too polished, too generic, or too keyword-heavy. Manually refining captions before publishing can remove these red flags. For example, if an AI tool suggests: *“Get your morning started right with this amazing coffee recipe! ☕✨ #coffee #viralrecipe”*, a manual edit could turn it into: *“Started my day with this creamy cold brew-easy recipe below. Who else needs coffee before work?”*

That small shift reduces spam signals while increasing relatability. Many creators on G2 reviews mention that light editing is enough to keep captions from tripping moderation filters.

**How human-AI collaboration improves authenticity**

AI excels at generating drafts, but humans excel at adding context. A caption about a fitness routine might be generated as: *“15-minute HIIT workout-sweat guaranteed!”* A human editor could add authenticity by saying: *“Tried this 15-minute HIIT workout between meetings-sweaty but worth it if you’re short on time.”*

This human-AI collaboration creates captions that sound lived-in rather than formulaic. As of mid-2025, creators who mix AI drafts with personal anecdotes report higher engagement ratios on Instagram and TikTok. It also reduces the risk of captions sounding like generic ad copy.

**Why editing tone can reduce ban risk**

Tone is one of the hardest things for algorithms to evaluate, yet one of the easiest ways to signal authenticity. AI captions sometimes skew overly promotional, which moderation systems associate with spam. Adjusting the tone-adding humor, subtlety, or even vulnerability-can help bypass detection.

For instance, X’s moderation AI is stricter with hard-sell captions like *“Buy now before it’s gone!”* but more lenient with conversational tones like *“I didn’t expect this gadget to become my daily go-to-worth checking out.”* Human edits can turn AI captions into safe, platform-friendly text.

**Personal experience:** I once scheduled a full week of captions directly from an AI tool, no edits. By day four, engagement dropped, and I suspected a shadowban. The following week, I manually tweaked every caption-sometimes just adding a personal detail or shifting the tone-and engagement bounced back. That contrast showed me how small human touches make a big difference in keeping reach steady.

**Book insight:** In *Show Your Work!* by Austin Kleon (Chapter 2, p. 34), Kleon writes about the value of being human in creative output. Sharing even imperfect, personal details connects more than polished perfection. The same principle applies here: editing AI captions adds human fingerprints, which not only resonate better with audiences but also reassure algorithms.

# Data-Driven Proof of AI Caption Performance

In 2025, no creator or brand wants to gamble with reach. Proof matters. That’s why the best AI caption tools are not just judged by flashy features but by measurable results-campaign performance, user reports, and third-party reviews. Data-driven evidence separates hype from reliability.

**Case studies of shadowban-free campaigns**

Several startups openly share campaign results to highlight how their AI caption tools avoid shadowbans. For example, Jasper AI showcased a fashion brand that used its captions for three months straight without a single visibility drop. Their secret was varying tone and integrating subtle keyword optimization tailored to Instagram’s Explore algorithm.

Another case shared on Product Hunt involved a TikTok influencer who paired Writesonic with manual edits. Over 50 videos reached the “For You” page without throttling, proving that AI can work safely when compliance is built in. These examples suggest the real value of AI captions lies in adaptive variation rather than brute-force automation.

**User reports from Trustpilot and G2 on AI caption tools**

Public reviews give unfiltered insights into caption tool performance. On Trustpilot, creators frequently mention losing reach after using free or outdated AI caption apps that ignored moderation signals. In contrast, tools with compliance filters-like Flick and Anyword-tend to receive higher ratings for stability.

G2 reviews also highlight that predictive scoring features help avoid bans. One user review for Anyword noted how its performance metrics flagged risky captions before publishing, saving them from repeated engagement drops. This shows that creators are actively prioritizing safety alongside creativity when evaluating tools.

**Metrics to track: reach, saves, and algorithm visibility**

Measuring caption performance is no longer just about likes. In 2025, platforms weigh engagement depth: saves, shares, and comment quality. Tools that help track these signals give creators a competitive edge.

For instance:

* **Reach** shows whether captions are being distributed widely or throttled.
* **Saves** indicate lasting value-posts people want to revisit.
* **Algorithm visibility** can be inferred from sudden changes in impressions, signaling whether captions triggered shadowban thresholds.

AI caption platforms now integrate analytics dashboards that map these metrics in real time. Combining those insights with manual checks makes it easier to prove whether captions are truly safe.

**Personal experience:** While consulting for a small business, I tracked reach and saves after switching to a compliance-focused AI caption tool. The difference was immediate-reach stabilized, and saves nearly doubled over four weeks. Seeing those numbers on the dashboard gave me the confidence that the captions weren’t triggering moderation penalties.

**Book insight:** In *Measure What Matters* by John Doerr (Chapter 4, p. 107), Doerr explains how setting clear objectives and measurable key results drives meaningful progress. The same applies to AI captions: without data-driven tracking, it’s impossible to know whether a tool is genuinely helping or silently hurting reach.

# Future of AI Captions and Platform Rules

The future of AI-generated captions isn’t just about smarter tools-it’s about how platforms themselves evolve. Social apps are in a constant arms race: creators try new tactics to get visibility, while platforms tighten moderation to keep content authentic. In 2025, AI captions sit right at the center of this tug-of-war, and the rules are shifting quickly.

**How evolving social algorithms will treat AI-generated text**

Algorithms are moving from keyword-based detection toward behavior-driven analysis. Instead of flagging a single suspicious caption, platforms now examine posting habits across weeks. For example, Instagram combines signals from captions, comment replies, and story interactions to decide if an account feels human.

That means future AI caption tools will need to integrate with broader activity patterns-helping users not only write safe captions but also plan varied posting rhythms. According to MIT Technology Review, research into contextual moderation shows that platforms are training models to detect “engagement authenticity,” not just text anomalies.

**Predictions for AI moderation policies in 2026**

Looking ahead, it’s likely that platforms will adopt more transparent moderation policies, at least partially. Public pressure for clarity is rising, especially from creators who rely on content for income. VentureBeat reports that advocacy groups are pushing platforms to provide clearer feedback when posts are restricted.

By 2026, we may see dashboards that explain why a post was limited-too many repetitive hashtags, overly promotional phrasing, or high bot-like activity. AI caption tools that anticipate and align with these new standards will become more valuable.

**Role of compliance-focused AI startups**

A new wave of compliance-first startups is already gaining traction. These companies don’t market themselves as creative AI platforms but as “algorithm-safe companions” for creators. Tools like these often feature real-time moderation checks, platform-specific compliance settings, and integrations with analytics tools.

PitchBook data shows increased funding toward AI moderation and compliance ventures, with investors betting that as platforms get stricter, demand for safety-oriented AI will rise. These startups could reshape the market, positioning themselves as essential partners for anyone creating at scale.

**Personal experience:** When I first started experimenting with AI caption tools, I underestimated how quickly platforms were tightening rules. What worked flawlessly in 2023 triggered restrictions by 2024. By mid-2025, I realized the only tools worth using were the ones investing in compliance innovation. That shift in mindset saved me from constant trial and error.

**Book insight:** In *The Innovator’s Dilemma* by Clayton Christensen (Chapter 5, p. 113), Christensen explains how disruption comes from companies willing to adapt faster to change. In the same way, compliance-focused AI startups are positioned to lead the captioning space-because they’re solving tomorrow’s moderation problems today.

# FAQ

# Do AI-generated captions always get shadowbanned?

No. AI captions are not automatically punished-what matters is how natural they appear and whether they trigger spam signals. Tools with built-in compliance filters, tone variation, and semantic diversity are far less likely to cause visibility issues than outdated generators that produce repetitive or keyword-stuffed text.

# How can I tell if my account is shadowbanned?

Early signs include sudden drops in reach, fewer impressions from non-followers, and a lack of engagement despite consistent posting. On Instagram and TikTok, you can test by searching your hashtags or captions from another account. If your post doesn’t appear where it normally should, you may be shadowbanned.

# Are free AI caption tools safe to use?

Free tools can be useful for drafting, but many lack compliance safeguards. According to user reviews on Trustpilot and Capterra, creators often report shadowbans after relying exclusively on free caption apps. Paid tools are more likely to invest in compliance technology and predictive scoring.

# Should I edit every AI caption before posting?

Yes. Even small edits-adding personal anecdotes, adjusting tone, or trimming hashtags-can make captions feel more authentic. Human refinement lowers the risk of detection and strengthens audience connection.

# What’s the safest way to use hashtags with AI captions?

Limit yourself to niche, relevant hashtags instead of generic trending ones. AI tools that suggest targeted hashtags, like Flick, help maintain visibility without spamming. Using three to five high-quality hashtags often outperforms stuffing captions with twenty.

# Can AI captions help with discoverability?

Absolutely. When used properly, AI can embed long-tail keywords and trending queries into captions that align with how people search content. On TikTok, this improves your chances of showing up in search results. On X, phrasing variations optimized for engagement can boost algorithmic visibility.

# Which metrics should I track to measure caption success?

Focus on reach, saves, shares, and comment depth. Likes alone don’t tell the full story anymore. AI tools that integrate performance dashboards-like Anyword’s predictive scoring-help creators adjust strategies in real time.

# Is it risky to rely only on automation?

Yes. Full automation risks detection and limits authenticity. The most effective strategy is human-AI collaboration: let AI handle the draft and structure, then refine it with human edits to match tone and context.

**Personal experience:** Early on, I tried to scale campaigns using only AI captions with no edits. It seemed efficient, but within weeks, engagement collapsed due to repetitive phrasing and keyword overuse. When I switched to a hybrid strategy-AI drafts plus human editing-performance not only recovered but grew steadily. That balance has stayed my default ever since.

1ocnsm3,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ocnsm3/pump_surging_question_breville_barista_express/,"""Pump Surging"" Question [Breville Barista Express BES860XL]","Hey, all. I have the oldest model of the Breville Barista Express. (BES860XL). I've actually had it for a few years, but not being a big espresso drinker, I only tend to use it maybe a few times a year. It was used at the time I got it (a friend found it at a thrift store at pretty much gave it to me for shipping costs), so the grind setting by the end was set to ""finest"" and just barely making a decent shot.

Anyway, In the past, I'd occasionally get this ""pump surging"" issue where the pressure gauge would jump around as the pump surges. In the past, when this happened, I'd make an adjustment (usually it was to make the grind a little coarser and/or lower the dose) and then it would pull shots with no problem. 

Even so, I always felt like those shots weren't ""right"" in terms of timing/output of liquid/etc.

So recently I put the work in to up my game (bought a new upper burr, replaced the group head gasket, descaled, cleaned, etc). 

Okay, great! Only now the first three shots I tried to pull (at slowly coarser grind sizes) resulted in the ""pump surge"" in conjunction with VERY slow shots that struggled to make it through the coffee bed in less than, say, 55 seconds for a 36 gram output. 

All that is to ask a fairly simple question: is it normal to get that kind of pump surge/gauge dial bounce on the older machine if the grind is too fine and the water is having a hard time getting through? Is that, like, a safety mechanism built it, or is this indicative of some kind of failure? 

I will add that I ran water through the dual wall filter and it did pressurize fine and hold a pressure without surging...which I was hoping was a good sign?

Additionally, I didn't continue to attempt dialing in because I wanted to ask about it here before I wasted more coffee. :-p

And I don’t mean egg coffee or the one with condensed milk, sugar, salt, or any other type of milk — I mean the standard black **Cà Phê Đen** with the Phin.

I drove through the whole country on a motorbike, and they had it everywhere — from new-wave cafés in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City to tiny villages near the Chinese border in the North.

Since coming back to Germany, I’ve tried everything: pure Robusta beans, Phin filters, importing all kinds of brands claiming to be “authentic Vietnamese coffee.” Still nothing tastes even remotely the same.

And it’s not like it’s *close*. We’re not talking Cola vs. Pepsi — it’s more like Sprite vs. Fanta levels of different.

To those who know the real deal: does anyone know a brand or online shop that ships to Germany and actually comes close to that authentic taste?",4,1761077576.0,VietNam,6,0.84,False
