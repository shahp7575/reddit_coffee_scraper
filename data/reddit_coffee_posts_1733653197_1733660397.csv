Hi all, woman in her 20s here. Thought I‚Äôd ask this question to gain some perspective in hindsight. If you have a crush on him and there‚Äôs some interest on his end and he asks you out but it‚Äôs still within a university context where people are talkative and friendly with everyone, is it a date?

I‚Äôll explain for context. Reflecting back on my first ‚Äúdate‚Äù ever at 20yo, til this day it‚Äôs unclear whether it was one or not. I guess date means different things to different people. So I‚Äôve had a crush on him for 2-3 months and he was in my class at university. We were talking on WhatsApp for group projects and when we would meet in person during lectures the communication was getting stronger both in person and online. But tbh knowing him it‚Äôs still blurry as to whether it was a date or not back then since he was the typical extroverted kind that had large friend groups, talked and was friendly with everybody. He kept insisting to go have beer/coffee and celebrate that we passed a very difficult course. We went at an outdoor caf√©/pub/garden under a castle in the evening with light bulbs on trees, very fancy decor and overall lovely vibes. 
Our hangout/date lasted 7 hours and he was mesmerised, didn‚Äôt wanna go home, was staring at me almost with sparkles in his eyes, constantly smiling (I had never seen him smile THIS MUCH in person at school). If I didn‚Äôt remind him that the last bus leaves at 11pm he wouldn‚Äôt have left. Immediately when we parted ways he texted the aftermath text. 

You might think this is obvious, but it‚Äôs not that clear since he talked and would hang out with girls as friends and in general he was very popular and had a loooot of friends (guys and girls) and was very extroverted constantly surrounded by people.

In the quest for ultimate comfort and efficiency, have you ever wondered why ergonomic keyboards with touchpads seem to be the holy grail of input devices? As someone who's spent countless hours trying out different keyboards - from the classic QWERTY to the funky Dvorak - I've found my ergonomic keyboard with touchpad to be an absolute game-changer. Let's dive into why these magic devices are worth every penny and how they can transform your typing experience.
  
  
## The Ergonomic Revolution

Ergonomics is like giving your body a cozy hug while you work, especially when it comes to keyboards. You might be wondering, ""What‚Äôs that all about?"" Well, ergonomics, in simple terms, is the science of designing things‚Äîlike desks and keyboards‚Äîso that they fit us humans better. This means reducing strain and discomfort while improving productivity. When I first laid hands on an ergonomic keyboard with a built-in touchpad, I had one of those ‚ÄúAha!‚Äù moments where the light bulb flickers on above your head, you know? It felt like my fingers were finally dancing to the right beat instead of clumsily stumbling around.

Before this magical moment, I was battling a pesky repetitive strain injury (RSI)‚Äîyou know, that nagging pain that feels like your wrist is auditioning for the next big horror flick. But after a few days with my ergonomic buddy, my discomfort started to fade like magic! The split design lets my hands rest in a more natural position, and the touchpad? Oh boy, it‚Äôs like my fingers found their long-lost best friend. 

The physical benefits were immediate: less wrist fatigue, no awkward angles, and a much more relaxed vibe while typing. I felt like I could tackle my to-do list with the energy of a raccoon after finding a stash of snacks. Who knew a keyboard could be such a game changer?

## The Touchpad Advantage

I can tell you, having a touchpad integrated into your keyboard is like finding out your favorite pizza place delivers free sodas ‚Äì it just makes everything better! I remember this one time, I was working on a project late at night. There I was, hunched over at my desk, frantically trying to meet a deadline. My mouse had other plans, though. It decided to phase out during the most critical moment, resulting in an epic battle of me sprinting after it as it rolled under my desk. Spoiler alert: I lost that battle, along with some valuable time! Since then, I‚Äôve embraced the magical combination of an ergonomic keyboard with a built-in touchpad, and it‚Äôs been a game-changer for my workflow.

Now, let‚Äôs talk touchpad technologies. There are mostly two types: capacitive and resistive. Capacitive touchpads respond to your finger's electrical charge, which means they‚Äôre super sensitive and can detect multi-touch gestures. On the flip side, resistive touchpads require pressure, which can be a bit of a workout for your fingers but helps when you‚Äôre wearing gloves. Each has its pros and cons, but honestly, having that built-in touchpad has saved me from more than a few mouse chase incidents. Imagine no more tangled wires or frantic searches! Now, if only I could figure out how to use that touchpad to make coffee‚Ä¶

## Size Matters: Choosing the Right Keyboard

When it comes to keyboards, size really does matter. I mean, have you ever tried typing on one of those tiny keyboards? It‚Äôs like trying to play piano with marshmallows for fingers! I remember my first experience with different keyboard sizes. I was on a quest‚Äîlike a knight in search of the Grail, but instead of a fancy cup, I was hunting for the perfect keyboard.

At first, I tried a compact one, claiming it was ‚Äúcutting-edge.‚Äù Spoiler alert: my fingers began to protest, sending urgent signals of pain after just a few minutes. As I ventured deeper into Keyboardville, I stumbled upon a mid-size option which seemed promising. It was like Goldilocks finding the porridge that wasn't too hot or too cold. But alas, it still wasn‚Äôt quite right. My wrists were beginning to feel like they were auditioning for a drama about arthritis.

Then there was the glorious discovery: an ergonomic keyboard with a built-in touchpad! Not only did it fit perfectly in my hands, but the wrist rest was a game-changer. It felt like my wrists had found their own cozy sofa. That, coupled with the adjustable height, made a world of difference. I realized that maintaining good posture is like finding the balance in a seesaw‚Äîtoo high or too low, and it‚Äôs all a mess. So, folks, choosing the right size in keyboards can make all the difference between smooth sailing and a rocky ride!

## Programmable Keys: The Power of Customization

Programmable keys can turn your ordinary work experience into a supercharged productivity machine. Imagine having a magic button right at your fingertips that performs tasks faster than you can say ‚ÄúI need a coffee break.‚Äù I remember when I first discovered how to customize the keys on my ergonomic keyboard. It felt like finding a secret weapon in a video game. Suddenly, all those repetitive clicks and tedious commands disappeared, replaced by a few easy taps on customized keys.

Creating custom shortcuts was a game-changer for me. For example, I set a single key to open my email app. Just one tap, and boom‚Äîmy inbox is ready! I also programmed another key to insert my email signature, saving me precious seconds that might otherwise have been spent watching the cursor blink impatiently while I clicked and typed.

There are different software options out there to help you program your keys, from basic setups to more sophisticated choices. Some let you record macros or even create unique profiles for different software programs. Did you know that some programs even allow you to set up keys that perform multiple actions with one press? Talk about being a wizard of efficiency! With a little exploration and creativity, you can customize your keyboard to fit your workflow perfectly and grab back those lost minutes. So, give those programmable keys a whirl‚Äîthey're not just buttons; they‚Äôre your ticket to a more streamlined day.

## Setting Up Your Ergonomic Workstation

Setting up your ergonomic workstation is like finding the right rhythm in a dance; it can elevate your comfort and productivity to a whole new level. When I first transformed my workspace, I didn‚Äôt just feel a difference‚ÄîI experienced it in my bones. Here‚Äôs how I did it.

Start with your chair. Get it adjusted so that your feet are flat on the floor, and your knees are at about a 90-degree angle. Trust me, you don‚Äôt want to look like a flamingo while typing! Next, your desk height should allow your elbows to sit at a comfortable angle too‚Äîagain, around 90 degrees. My desk used to be too high, and I felt like I was typing from the treetops!

Now, let‚Äôs talk screens. Your monitor or laptop screen should be at eye level. This means you don‚Äôt have to crane your neck like a giraffe to see what‚Äôs on it. A quick tip: place books or a sturdy box underneath your monitor if it‚Äôs too low. Just make sure whatever you use is stable‚Äînobody wants a monitor avalanche!

Lastly, don‚Äôt overlook your keyboard and touchpad placement. They should be close enough so you don‚Äôt have to stretch your arms, creating a cozy little bubble of productivity. Trust me, with just a few adjustments, your workspace can become a comfort zone where your creativity can thrive!

## The Future of Ergonomics: What's Next?

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about what the future holds for ergonomic keyboards with touchpads, and let me tell you, the innovations brewing out there are, quite frankly, mind-blowing. We're not just talking about those same old designs with a few bells and whistles. No, no! I‚Äôm talking about an exciting shift towards smarter, more adaptive technology that can really change how we work and play at our computers.

For one, trends in ergonomic keyboard design are leaning heavily on integration. Imagine a keyboard that adjusts to your hand position automatically. Like, one minute you're typing and the next, it knows you‚Äôve gone for a snack (don‚Äôt judge, we all do it) and adjusts its height or angle to keep your wrists relaxed when you get back. Pretty neat, right? Plus, there‚Äôs this growing emphasis on sustainability, so keyboards might soon be made from recycled materials, putting the ‚Äúeco‚Äù in ergonomic. 

But wait‚Äîthere‚Äôs more! Have you ever wished your keyboard could learn how you type and adapt its sensitivity? Well, it might become a reality soon. With AI and machine learning making waves, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see a keyboard that becomes your personal typing tutor over time. What do you think? What‚Äôs the next big thing in ergonomic keyboards that will knock our socks off?

## Conclusions
  
  
In conclusion, an ergonomic keyboard with touchpad isn't just a gadget; it's a life-changer. It's been my companion in reducing strain, boosting productivity, and making my workspace a genuinely comfortable place to be. So, if you're ready to take the ergonomic leap, don't hesitate - your wrists (and your future self) will thank you!

I know its not to do with the quality of the food as i have eaten in both and they are nearly identical, the coffee is identical etc.. 

I used to see this behaviour in toronto and new york and thought it was really funny how people can be such sheep for certain situations... like lemmings...

They see a review and a couple of instagram posts and suddenly its THAT EXACT CAFE and no other where they will buy their coffee... 

I am literally sitting inside a lovely cafe with lovely food right now looking at people in the pouring rain across the street...what a lovely sinday they are having... its hilarious.

* WHISKEY - Irish whiskey, based on the label. It is made by a company called [**Uisce Beatha**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uisce_beatha), which is the Irish word for whiskey. A fun little piece of trivia right there.
* WINE - [**Merlot wine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlot), based on the label.

**FALLOUT 4 CHEMS**

* ADDICTOL - [**Buprenorphine, methadone, acamprosate, disulfiram, naltrexone**](https://www.samhsa.gov/medications-substance-use-disorders), or any other drug meant to help with drug addictions, mixed with a purgative and endorphin blockers.
* AGILE SLUDGEPAK - The recipe is condensed radioactive fog, dirty water, and fertilizer (*shit*) mixed into a Stimpak syringe which you then inject into yourself. I can't even begin to think of a real-life equivalent to this but know that it would most definitely kill you. This goes for all the sludge recipes: some include fiberglass or alcohol you inject into yourself, while others involve chugging down dirty water and mosquito meat. All of them are pure fiction.
* BERRY MENTATS - Same as Fallout 3.
* BUFFJET - Steroids mixed with cocaine.
* BUFFOUT - Same as Fallout 1.
* BUFFTATS - Steroids mixed with adderal.
* CALMEX - [**Ketamine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketamine). It's a sedative that induces relaxation and can block out pain. Calmex increases your weapon accuracy and sneak attack multiplier, which requires being calm.
* CALMEX SILK - [**Benadryl**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphenhydramine#Recreational_use). It's a sedative like ketamine that can induce relaxation and euphoria. Like Day Tripper, the Luck bonus is caused by the euphoria letting you take risks you wouldn't otherwise take and lowering inhibitions, making you ""*happy-go-lucky*"".
* DADDY-O - [**Heroin**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin). It is in an orange syringe similar to some heroin needles. Heroin can cause relaxation and pain relief, which could help with focus, thus the boost to Perception. The description says it was ""*Popular with beatniks and intellectuals before the Great War*"".
* DAY TRIPPER -[ **LSD**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD). It has ""*trip*"" in the name and stereotypical hippy-like flower patterns on the bottle. It increases Luck and Charisma, aka making you ""*happy-go-lucky*"".
* FURY - [**Bath salts**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_salts_(drug)). They can put one into a state of dissociative psychosis and extreme aggression, similar to the drug's name, Fury. This also explains the penalty to Perception.
* GRAPE MENTATS - Same as Fallout 3 with the addition of alcohol.
* JET - Same as Fallout 2.
* JET FUEL - Cocaine mixed with fuel as an [**inhalant**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inhalant#Toxic_inhalants).
* MED-X - Same as Fallout 3.
* MENTATS - Same as Fallout 1.
* MYSTERIOUS SERUM - As far as I know, there is no alien artifact that makes your blood into a super serum. I'm gonna comfortably put this in the ""*fictional*"" category.
* ORANGE MENTATS - Same as Fallout 3.
* OVERDRIVE - [**Speedball**](https://greenhousetreatment.com/stimulants/crystal-meth-addiction/speedball/), or an opioid mixed with a stimulant. This is why it's called Overdrive, as the potent mixture of drugs literally puts your body into overdrive. The erratic effects allow you to score more criticals as you attack unpredictably and without hesitation.
* PSYCHO - Same as Fallout 1.
* PSYCHO JET - PCP and meth mixed with cocaine.
* PSYCHOBUFF - PCP and meth mixed with steroids.
* PSYCHOTATS - PCP and meth mixed with adderal.
* RAD-X - Same as Fallout 1.
* RADAWAY - Same as Fallout 1.
* SKEETO SPIT - [**Iresine leaf**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iresine) mixed with blood as a transfusion remedy. In some parts of the world, Iresine species are used as herbal and folk medicine.
* SMOOTH OPERATOR - [**MDMA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA) mixed with liquor, which is in the recipe. It improves Charisma similar to Grape Mentats and has a recipe similar to Party-Time Mentats.
* STIMPAK - Same as Fallout 1.
* ULTRA JET - Same as Fallout 3, but with a different recipe.
* VAULT 81 CURE - [**Panacea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panacea_(medicine)), a fictional medicine that cures all ailments.
* X-111 COMPOUND - In-game it is a mutagenic compound that shields cells from being damaged by radiation. Since this doesn't exist in reality, I'm going to chalk it up to anti-radiation medicine such as [**potassium iodide**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_iodide) as mentioned with RadAway and Rad-X.
* X-CELL - Judging by the name, it could possibly use stem cells. The name is also a pun since it makes you ""*excel*"" at everything. By its experimental and rare nature, I'm guessing it uses some sort of genetic engineering, possibly FEV, for its powerful effects.",1,1733659419.0,Fallout,1,1.0,False

* CRUNCHY MUTFRUIT - [**Apple**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Smith). Retains the color of Fallout 3 Mutfruit, but has the shape of Fallout 1 and 2 Mutfruit. Possibly a hybrid between the two fruits between games.
* DANDY BOY APPLES - [**Andy Boy Apples**](https://pt-br.facebook.com/AndyBoyProduce/photos/d41d8cd9/10154517036634057/). This is the best link I could find since their main site URL was down. The actual product is most likely freeze dried or candied apples.

* FRESH POTATO - [**Domestic potato**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato).
* GUM DROPS - There are no brands of radioactive [**gum drops**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gumdrop). This might be a reference to marketing gimmicks used by Warheads, Toxic Waste, and other ""*extreme sour*"" candy.
* HATCHLING MIRELURK MEAT - [**Hatchling crab meat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_meat).
* HUMAN FLESH - [**Long pig**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_cannibalism).

* IGUANA-ON-A-STICK - Same as Fallout 1.
* INSTAMASH - [**Deb's instant mashed potatoes**](https://collections.museumsvictoria.com.au/items/1466591) from the 60's. Both have the same blue and white color scheme with the product's name at the top in white, capitalized text.
* JUNK FOOD - [**Potato chips**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_chip). I don't think they are based on a specific brand.

* MOLE RAT MEAT - [**Rat meat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_meat).
* MOLE RAT WONDER MEAT - [**Rat meat**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_meat) mixed with glue. Not sure if you can cure meat with glue, but the ""*wonder*"" part of the name is likely based on products popular in the 50s with similar names like Wonderbread and Miracle Whip. Glue could be used as a binder.
* MUTFRUIT - [**Plum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plum) and [**blackberry**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackberry) hybrid due to its new appearance.
* NOODLES - [**Ramen noodles**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramen). The model most resembles ramen noodles, and it is associated with Asian theming such as the Brass Lantern's sign and Takahashi.

* SWEETROLL - [**Sweetroll**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_roll) with frosting.

**FALLOUT 3 DRINKS**

* AQUA PURA - [**Aqua Pura**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqua_Pura), which is a real brand of mineral water.
* BEER - Same as Fallout 1, although it is unknown whether it is home-brewed or not. The model has no label. The icon has a label, but nothing is written on it.
* DIRTY WATER - [**Dirty, irradiated water**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_pollution).
* HOLY WATER - [**Irradiated holy water**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_water), although there is no known cult like the Children of Atom that worship radiation, holy water is notoriously filled with bacteria.
* MOONSHINE - [**Prohibition-style moonshine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonshine) made from Buddah's hand fruit and battery acid. This would most likely kill you if consumed in real life. Or make you go blind.
* NUKA-COLA - Same as Fallout 1.
* NUKA-COLA QUANTUM - [**Radithor**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radithor) in soft-drink form. Glow-in-the-dark soda is possible with compounds from jellyfish as described earlier. It is described as having ""*twice the calories,¬†twice the¬†carbohydrates,¬†twice the¬†caffeine, and¬†twice the¬†taste""*, so it's possibly a REVERSE version of Diet Coke/Coke Zero. The [**real version**](https://www.amazon.com/Nuka-Quantum-Fallout-Jones-Bottle/dp/B016ZEGTBS) is flavored like berry lemonade.
* PURIFIED WATER - [**Generic bottled purified water**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purified_water).
* SCOTCH - [**Generic scotch**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotch_whisky). The label just says ""*Scotch*"" with a leaf symbol.
* VODKA - [**Generic vodka**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vodka). The label shares an emblem-style design similar to some vodka bottles in the 1950s and has text, presumably in Russian. The icon just says ""*Vodka*"".
* WHISKEY - [**Old Royal Whiskey**](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/brand/85446/old-royal). The label says ""*Olde Royale*"", a clear reference.
* WINE - [**Generic red wine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_wine). The label is mostly illegible, although ""*LA*"" can be made out, suggesting it is written in French. The icon just says ""*Vine*"".

**FALLOUT 3 CHEMS**

* ADAPTDEL BIOGEL - Alien Biogel, but adapted for human use.
* ALIEN BIOGEL - It is described by Elliot as being ""*slathered onto wounds*"". It is most likely ointment like futuristic [**aloe vera**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aloe_vera) or [**Silvadine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_sulfadiazine), seeing as how they use energy weapons.
* ANT NECTAR - [**Ant nectar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant). Honeypot ants collect nectar from flowers.
* ANT QUEEN PHEROMONES - [**Ant pheromones**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_pheromone) used by ants for communication.
* BERRY MENTATS - [**Piracetam**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piracetam). Specifically, berry-flavored Piracetam pills in an Altoids tin. Its effects of enhanced Intelligence are similar to Piracetam's cognitive-enhancing effects.
* BLOOD PACK - [**Blood bag**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_transfusion). The reason they heal 1 HP is because you can't perform a blood transfusion, so you drink the contents, as confirmed by the Hemotaphage perk.
* BUFFOUT - Same as Fallout 1.
* FIRE ANT NECTAR - [**Ant nectar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_ant), although honeypot ants do not have venom.
* GRAPE MENTATS - [**MDMA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA). Specifically, grape-flavored MDMA pills in an Altoids tin. Its effects of enhanced Charisma are similar to MDMA's empathy-enhancing effects.

* STIMPAK - Same as Fallout 1.

* MRE - [**2000 to 2001 MRE Menu No. 2, Boneless Pork Chop**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YM5vQBCXLj0). If you look closely, you can see that this is what's written on the packaging. Lack of variety, much?
* MUSHROOM CLOUD - [**Merigune**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meringue). The recipe calls for gum drops, Sugar Bombs, and Nightstalker eggs. Egg whites and sugar, plus citric acid from the gum drops, could make meringue. The meringue puffing into the shape of a mushroom cloud is what gives it its name.
* MUTANT CAVE FUNGUS - [**Cortinarius austrovenetus**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortinarius_austrovenetus) matches it the closest in appearance, and unlike normal Cave Fungus, Mutant Cave Funus is not radiotrophic.
* MUTFRUIT - Same as Fallout 3.

* POTATO CHIPS - Same as Fallout 3.
* PRESERVED MEAT/PRE-WAR STEAK - [**Freeze-dried steak**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze_drying). If they were really around before the war, freeze-drying wouldn't cut it, and a special preservative would have to be used.
* PRICKLY PEAR FRUIT - [**Prickly pear fruit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia_basilaris).
* RADROACH MEAT - Same as Fallout 3.
* RUBY'S CASSEROLE - There is no casserole recipe that calls for scorpion venom or scorpion... anything, to my knowledge. Cut content shows it is made of rat and jalepeno.

* STRANGE MEAT PIE - Same as Fallout 3.
* SUGAR BOMBS - Same as Fallout 3.
* THICK RED PASTE - [**Blood pudding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pudding). A more literal take on pudding in this case, as it involves cooking blood with flour to turn it into a thick, edible paste.
* THIN RED PASTE - Blood. It can be found on creatures with Them's Good Eatin'.
* TRAIL MIX - Dehydrated apple and pear slices with pine nuts and Corn Pops.
* WASTELAND OMELET - [**Ostrich egg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_egg) omelet with boxed mac n' cheese powder, apple, and snapping turtle meat. Ostrich is the only egg that comes close to the size of a Deathclaw egg.

* XANDER ROOT - [**Jicama**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyrhizus_erosus). Both are similar-looking roots that grow in Nevada.

* BITTER DRINK - [**Powdered jicama**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyrhizus_erosus) and [**desert globemallow**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphaeralcea_ambigua) distilled into a tribal healing exlir, as it uses the same ingredients (*xander root and broc flower*) as healing powder.
* BLACK COFFEE - [**Tobacco tea**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotiana_attenuata) with [**honey mesquite**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neltuma_glandulosa) to dilute the mixture. In reality, brewing tobacco like this would most likely kill you from extreme nicotine exposure.
* BLOOD PACK - Same as Fallout 3.
* DIRTY WATER - Same as Fallout 3.
* DIXON'S WHISKEY - Low-quality [**whiskey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whisky), possibly with drugs added due to its unusually high chance of addiction (*50%*) and pronounced negative effects.

* NUKA-COLA QUARTZ - Bubblegum-flavored cola, similar to Inca Cola.

Let‚Äôs spill some contaminated tea:

# 1. Complain First, Science Later

Every post is either *‚ÄúMy PI is a tyrant,‚Äù* *‚ÄúWhy does this protocol hate me?‚Äù* or *‚ÄúI spilled phenol on my leg; will I die?‚Äù* Spoiler: No, but your will to live might.

# 2. The Eternal PI Roast

*‚ÄúMy PI emailed me at 2 a.m. about an experiment I didn‚Äôt even run. Should I quit science?‚Äù* Yes. But also no, because r/labrats will drag you right back into the toxic cycle of pipette Stockholm Syndrome.

# 3. Trash Equipment Rants

*‚ÄúThe -80 freezer alarm won‚Äôt stop screaming, and I think the centrifuge is possessed.‚Äù* No one cares, Jessica. Just slap some duct tape on it and pray to the gods of NIH funding.

# 4. Postdoc Flexes

*‚ÄúI worked 120 hours this week, ran 40 Western blots, and still had time to teach undergrads.‚Äù* Cool, but you‚Äôre also one lab accident away from starring in a sci-fi horror movie.

# 5. Undergrad Bashing Central

Every third post: *‚ÄúMy undergrad can‚Äôt even pipette.‚Äù* Meanwhile, the undergrad is probably making TikToks about how much they hate you.

# 6. Experiments Gone Wild

*‚ÄúAccidentally mixed ethanol with my sample. Should I start over?‚Äù* No, just publish the results anyway. That‚Äôs how half of r/labrats‚Äô readers got their PhDs.

# 7. Mystery Goo and WTF Science

*‚ÄúFound this in the fume hood. Is it radioactive?‚Äù* Yes. Also no. Either way, just don‚Äôt touch it.

# 8. Lab Snacks > Lab Science

More posts about which snacks belong in the communal fridge than actual scientific breakthroughs. Hint: It‚Äôs not your lunch from three months ago.

# 9. ‚ÄúAm I the Lab Ahole?‚Äù**

*‚ÄúI used someone else‚Äôs pipettes without asking. Was that wrong?‚Äù* Yes, Brad. You‚Äôre why there‚Äôs an unspoken pipette war in every lab.

# 10. Hoarding Protocols Like Gold

*‚ÄúCan someone send me the protocol for X? My PI refuses to share it.‚Äù* Here‚Äôs a protocol: stop asking Reddit and read a damn paper.

# 11. RIP Lab Mice

Every post about animal models somehow turns into a philosophical debate about whether mice are our colleagues or just furry test tubes.

# 12. Chronically Overworked, Proudly Underpaid

*‚ÄúI worked 70 hours this week for a $25 Amazon gift card. Should I be grateful?‚Äù* No, but at least now you can buy more coffee to keep suffering.

r/labrats, you‚Äôre the over-caffeinated, under-appreciated backbone of science, but let‚Äôs be real: the only experiment truly working is how long you can survive on free pizza from seminars. Stay chaotic! üß™",0,1733658784.0,labrats,2,0.37,False

To be clear: I am not suggesting that we should ban selling caffeine to children. If a kid wants to buy a cup of coffee, a can of energy drink, or a caffeinated milkshake, they should be allowed to do that without being carded. 

The problem is that kids are impressionable, and they‚Äôre surrounded by advertisements for caffeine. The Starbucks unicorn latte, the Coca Cola Santa Claus commercials, and the Red Bull cartoon commercials are just a few of the many caffeine advertisements targeted at kids. 

Pediatricians recommend no more than 100 mg of caffeine per day for teens, and no caffeine for children under 12.  https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx

Caffeine is physically addictive. An 8 year old who starts drinking a can of Coca Cola (32 mg) every other day could easily turn into a teenager who needs a Monster Energy Drink (160 mg) every day to avoid a headache.

One thing I noticed was that many of these started closing around the turn of the millennium. Mostly becoming mini supermarkets selling anything from fresh produce, cookware, vapes and alcohol. Some became places of worship which I always found quite amusing going from smoky dens of drunken debauchery and the obligatory Saturday  night punch up to be transformed into a place of sanctuary, purity and prayer.  Some became trendy flats and some pretty good restaurants. It's just demographic change and is something that happens in the UK every generation or two we're a constantly changing nation, always have been. This isn't my grumble though. My issue is that we have seen the demise of comfortable private places where intimate conversation can be held face to face without the need to have to use our phones with apps owned by the likes of meta.  Meta who own the most popular and convenient messaging apps in the world we use  to chat remotely, lubricated by the availability of cheap booze to be consumed at home is without doubt leading to people putting things online that normally would never be typed out. Anx off the cuff drunken remark, largely forgotten about by most within earshot but now preserved for immortality on the internet on some server the other side of the world. It has the ability to be used against you and quite often screen grabs of 'private' conversations from minor celebrities end up smeared all over the front page.  Cheap booze in itself isn't a terrible thing but to some it has become a health risk both physically and mentally. Drinking alone without actual direct contact with other people is indeed unhealthy and used to be frowned upon.. So you have a load of people who would once go to the pub and chat over a few beers now doing this without even having to leave home. The conversation is held over meta owned apps, is scanned for ad words, recorded and sold on as data to whoever will pay the top price for it or leaked 'oh dear we've had a data breach...' a familiar story... We need private places to come back, where people can chat, without the usual cameras peering at us as there are now in coffee shops and eateries all under the comforting weasel words of 'For your safety and comfort'.  Personally, having a cctv camera watching me slurp an espresso or be behind me as I check my phone or roll a cheeky joint for later isn't very comforting. It is an intrusive new thing that everyone seems fine with. I may be old fashioned and seem that I need to wear a tinfoil hat by some but as someone who is quite private and respectful of others privacy there are some changes I certainly don't like.

I (28F) am at my wits end. I'm just tired. My boyfriend (28F) changes his attitude quicker than my mood swings and I don't know how to deal with it.

This morning he was super sweet cuddly and adorable, and while we were in the kitchen I was starting to make breakfast. 

I don't know if I do, but I highly suspect to have ADHD because I strain to focus on a task, if I happen to do one thing I struggle to do another or even completely forget about the one thing I was doing. This'll come in important later.

So while I was doing breakfast, I forced myself to make the times line up (e.g put bacon in first so I can make coffee while it cooks). My bf asked me when his coffee will be ready so my brain short-circuited and I started making coffee, completely forgetting to set the timer on the air fryer etc. 

Trying to be helpful he suggested he'd do the coffee, except I've got my own way of doing it and usually measure it with muscle memory (cafetiere). When I told him no thanks he immediately storms off saying ""The one time I try to help and it's not good enough!"" So I offered he could wash a cup or two and I just get a ""Oh so now you want my help?"" 

Defeated I give up, and I just carry on. Both in a bad mood, I asked him (tiredly) how many bacon rashers he'd like and he just says he doesn't care, doesn't want any. So I'm asking him ok do you want coffee? And he goes ""No don't fancy it anymore""

And I'm so. So tired. AITA for telling him no to help with the cafetiere? I'm just genuinely trying to see where I went wrong and where is attitude came from but even when I ask nicely he just shrugs and doesn't talk to me.",3,1733657095.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False
1h9gv5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/glutenfree/comments/1h9gv5h/tips_for_travelling_to_spain_if_you_have_celiac/,Tips for travelling to Spain if you have celiac disease or gluten intolerance.,"I have to travel a lot for work and I am always afraid of getting glutened abroad, specially the embarrasment of it happening at a work meeting. So for all fellow bussiness travellers and tourists coming to my country (Spain) I want to make things easier. As 1% of Spanish population has celiac diseases and I think our country has improved a lot in the last years and I believe we are quite a friendly country for people that follow a gluten free diet.

  
**First a little bit of Spanish:**

Let's lear some useful Spanish words:

\- Wheat: Trigo

\- Barley: Cebada

\- Rye: Centeno

\- Oats: Avena

\- Spelt: Espelta

\- Triticale: Triticale

\- Gluten: Gluten

\- Gluten free: Sin gluten.

\- Contains gluten: Tiene gluten, contiene gluten.

\- May contain (traces of) gluten/wheat/barley/rye/oats: Puede contener (trazas de) gluten/trigo/cebada/centeno/avena.

These are important to interpret labels, however, almost all products will be labelled in English and most of them  French, Italian, German and Portuguese too.

  
**Labels:**

1) Products that are naturally gluten free cannot be labelled as gluten free. This can be a little bit confusing, but the reasoning is that labelling an apple as gluten free would be false advertising as all apples are gluten free. However, if they have traces they have to declare like the (in)famous lentil case.

2) Products that you expect to contain gluten: bread, cookies, pasta, breadcrumbs... can be labelled as gluten free. They would say ""Sin gluten"" and have this symbol (the second one if for gluten free oats).

[Gluten free symbol and certified gluten free oats symbol](https://preview.redd.it/3ks8yyflml5e1.jpg?width=369&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=edd44448a6eaf0ece927d6261d08bfe67263561c)

Below, there is a label of pasta. You can see the allegerns are bolded in order to easily spot them in the list of ingredients:

https://preview.redd.it/e3pam0sqnl5e1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ba4c56dfe6c8fa6e914d76658bc1f096d15f603

The other 14 allergens that are mandatory to declare are:

\- Shellfish: Crust√°ceos, marisco.

\- Egg:  Huevo.

\- Fish: Pescado

\- Peanuts: Cacahuete/man√≠

\- Soy: Soja

\- Nuts: Nueces, Frutos de c√°scara, almendras, avellanas, anarcardos, nueces de Brasil, nueces de macadamia...

\-  Celery: apio

\- Mustard: Mostaza

\- Sesame: S√©samo

\- Lupins: Altramuces

\- Sulfur dioxide and sulfites: Di√≥xido de sulfuro and sulfites

\- Mollusk: Moluscos.

\- Milk: Leche

  
**Buying gluten free food.**

Most supermarkets have a gluten free aisle such as Carrefour, Alcampo, Hipercor, Eroski, Familia, Dino and Gadis. They have a selection of products for gluten free brands (Adpan, Abuelo Bread, Schar, Santiveri, Gullon...). Sometimes, you can find the gluten free product by the gluten containing one. For example: gluten free pasta is in the pasta aisle, gluten free soy in the Asian aisle or gluten free tortillas in the Latin American aisle. So if you don't find the product in the gluten free aisle don't asume is not in the store.

Mercadona is a popular supermarket chain in Spain but almost all their products are from their store-brand: ""Hacendado"" which has many gluten free options.

Aldi and Lidl are not good for gluten free in Spain, unfortunately.

Even if you are at the gluten free aisle, check the labels, I had a nasty suprise some months ago because I found buckwheat with gluten traces in the aisle (buckwheat = trigo sarraceno in Spanish).

Finally, some big drug stores have a ""Diet Food Aisle"" and you can find gluten free products there.

  
**Eating in a Restaurant.**

Restaurants must declare in their menus the presence of any of their 14 allergens. However, some of them may have fine print in them saying: ""We cannot rule out the possibility of cross contamination/No podemos excluir la presencia de trazas"".

  
The national celiac association puts a seal in restaurants that they have assessed as safe for celiacs:

[FACE \(Spain's national celiac association\) seal for restaurants](https://preview.redd.it/vz94k2kqrl5e1.jpg?width=522&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=05ea8eefaed31c6ab1cc1de6126afab14bbe9ccb)

Sometimes restaurants that don't have the seal can be safe for celiac, you may call them and ask or read reviews in TripAdvisor or Find me Gluten Free.

  
Big hotel chains usually have gluten free options in their morning buffet. Sometimes they have a gluten free table and sometimes you have to ask the waiter for it. Unfortunately the bread is almost always a frozen loaf that has the texture of chewing gum... Spanish bread is quite good and I miss it dearly. And that is why the next point is...

  
**Gluten-free Bakeries.**

Spanish bread, specially in the North of Spain is amazing. Unfortunately not every city has a gluten free bakery (mine for example...). If you happen to stay in a place with a good gluten free bakery try it, and if you want something to eat quickly and continue visit buy some ""empanadillas"" to go (for our latin American friends they are just empandas). They can be either fried or baked and filled with chicken, grounded beef, mushrooms, tuna... and my favorite cod. In Galicia (north of Spain) you can have a slice of the bigger version ""Empanada gallega"" and make sure to try ""bacalao con pasas"", cod with raisings, if you want a combination of sweet and savory.

[Gluten free empanadillas](https://preview.redd.it/6ri3koo3tl5e1.png?width=304&format=png&auto=webp&s=a01595af884d244bac510ae8885b08ee628e8006)

  
**Some Spanish products that you must try:**

\- Jam√≥n Ib√©rico: The king of our gastronomy. It must be gluten free. You can buy it at deli stores or order a plate (una raci√≥n) in Restaurants. However, it is usually served with some side bread or breadsticks so tell your waiter in advance that you have celiac disease. The cheaper version is called serrano ham and can be found in supermarkets. It might contain gluten so check the label. It is great for sandwhiches. 

\- Chorizo: it should be gluten free if the quality is good. But you'd better check the label.

\- Tortilla de patatas: The potato omelett is amazing and vegetarian. It's also a popular tapa served alongside with coffee or beer (and when I say tapa, I mean it's free and complimentary). Again, they might serve it with bread so ask first.

\- Paella: it shold be gluten free unless they are using some kind of spice or food coloring that contains gluten.

\- Croquetas: they are not gluten free, but it is a common food in gluten free restaurants because they know us celiacs crave it. My favorite ones? Squid croquetas with squid ink.

\- Gazpacho and salmorejo: I love these cold tomato soups in summer... but unfortunately they are made with bread so you have to look for a gluten free option. If you don't top it with boled egg or serrano ham it is a vegan dish.

\- Calamares a la romana (breaded calamari): they have gluten so again, look for a gluten-free version. If you put it in a Sandwhich it is called bocadillo de calamares and it is the typical dish of Madrid.

\- Pisto manchego: amazing winter dish, specially with a rice side and some sunny side up eggs. Should be gluten free. It is easy and if you take away the eggs it would be vegan.

\- Pulpo a la gallega/Pulpo √° feira: if you are not squimish about eating octopus this dish is amazing. 

\- Patatas con alioli/patatas bravas: the problem with eating french fries is that restaurants usually makes them in the same frier as croquetas, breaded calamari... and get contaminated. 

\- Callos a la madrile√±a: I do not like offal so I have never tried them... but should be gluten free.

\- Fabada asturiana: it is a dish made with beans, chorizo, blood sausage (morcilla),  lacon... try it.

\- Papas arrug√°s con mojo pic√≥n: It is a dish from the Canary Islands, baked potatos with mojo sauce, the gluten free version is available in many places. By the way, gofio, another Canary ingredient is absolutely NOT gluten free.

\- Morcilla de burgos: Blood sausage with rice, sounds bad but I swear it is delicious.

\- Crema catalana: very tasty dessert that should be gluten free. Same with flan (caramel pudding).

  
**Beer.**

There are gluten free beers available in most bars. Try gluten free Estrella Galicia or Alhambra. I am not really a beer person so I prefer to order some cider (NOTE: a friend from the United States was suprised that cider had alcohol and called it a spiked cider, but the alcohol comes from the apples, is not added). The best cider is in Asturias and has recently been declared [Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity](https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/asturian-cider-culture-01959)

  
**National celiac association.**

It is called FACE [https://celiacos.org/](https://celiacos.org/) and has lots of good advice in its webpage that is written in Spanish and English.

  
**Final Words.**

When you think of mid-century modern furniture, the first thing that probably comes to mind is those warm, rich wood tones. But what exactly makes them so iconic?

**The Go-To Wood Colors of Mid-Century Modern**  
Mid-century modern loves natural, earthy wood finishes. Here‚Äôs a quick look:

* **Walnut:** The classic. Deep, reddish-brown. The gold standard of mid-century style.
* **Teak**: Warm, honey-like. Great for dining chairs and tables‚Äîit‚Äôs durable and beautiful.
* **Rosewood**: For a statement piece, rosewood is bold with its dark tones and grain.
* **Oak and Ash**: Lighter woods like oak and ash are more Scandinavian, bringing a fresh, neutral feel to mid-century interiors.

**Why These Work**

Mid-century modern is all about form and function. These wood tones anchor the clean lines of the furniture. Plus they‚Äôre versatile and work with both neutral and bold accent colors so they‚Äôre good for any home.

**How to Tell Mid-Century Modern Furniture**  
When you‚Äôre out shopping or just browsing look for:

* **Natural Wood Grain:** The grain is often left exposed, showing off the wood.
* **Tapered Legs:** Many pieces, like coffee tables or cabinets, have angled, skinny legs that give a light feel.

### Devotional: Go and Tell ‚Äì The Call to Share His Good News

**Scripture Reading:**

‚ÄúGo therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.‚Äù

‚Äî Matthew 28:19-20 (ESV)

**Reflection:**

As followers of Christ, we are given a precious commission ‚Äî to go and tell the world about His love, grace, and the incredible good news of salvation. This is not just a task; it is a privilege! Imagine being entrusted with a light that can brighten the darkest corners of the world and bring hope to despair.

In our daily lives, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle, to become preoccupied with our own challenges. Yet, Jesus calls us to step out of our comfort zones and share the transformative message that He so freely gave to us. There‚Äôs a world outside our walls that longs for the hope and assurance we have found in Him.

**Encouragement:**

The call to share His Good News may seem daunting, but remember that we are never alone in this mission. Jesus promises that He will be with us always. Take a moment to reflect on the joy that comes when you share your story. Your testimony, your experience of God‚Äôs faithfulness, is a powerful tool that can impact lives.

You don‚Äôt need a seminary degree or extensive biblical knowledge to share His love. A simple act of kindness, an encouraging word, or sharing your own experience of how God has worked in your life can profoundly influence someone else‚Äôs journey. The Good News of Christ is, at its core, a story ‚Äî a story that invites others into a relationship with Him.

**Practical Steps:**

1. **Pray:** Begin with prayer. Ask God for opportunities to share His love with those around you. Look for divine appointments in your everyday life, whether at work, school, or in the neighborhood.
2. **Be Intentional:** Set aside time during your week where you can consciously seek to connect with others. It could be inviting a friend for coffee or volunteering in your community. Every interaction can be an opportunity to share the love of Christ.
3. **Share Your Story:** Think about how Jesus has transformed your life. Write down key moments when you felt His presence, guidance, or peace. These are your powerful testimonies ‚Äî share them!
4. **Encourage and Connect:** Look for ways to encourage those who may be seeking or struggling with their faith. Showing genuine interest in their lives can open doors for meaningful conversations about Christ.

**Prayer:**

Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of Your Good News. Help me to be bold and courageous in sharing the love of Jesus with others. I pray for the hearts that need to hear Your message, and I ask for Your guidance in the opportunities You present. May my life be a reflection of Your grace, and may I always remember that You are with me, encouraging and empowering me to go and tell. Amen.

**Closing Thought:**

Today, let your heart be open to the leading of the Holy Spirit. As you go about your day, consider who you might reach out to. The world is hungry for hope, and you carry the Good News within you. Go and tell!

I am a long time lurker but this community has been such a blessing for me. I read the posts, love, support and encouragement from others and it has helped me in my own life so many times. Y‚Äôall are amazing.
My girlfriend, the one who I thought I would spend my life with, cheated on me. My heart feels like it‚Äôs in pieces. I knew the entire time. I always felt that feeling in my gut that something was wrong. I asked her about it so many times and she would look me straight into my eyes and lie. She was around my kids, in my home. I feel so dumb. I loved her so much and did everything right for her. I believe I have always been a good partner but I gave her my all. Idk why I thought, if I showed her that all her needs were met, that she would choose me and never cheat. The girl she cheated with doesn‚Äôt even compare to me and that feels wrong to say. We are just not on the same level and my girl‚Äôs needs were all the way met. She always told me I was the only one who ever treated her like a girl, that nobody ever made love to her like that, that nobody ever did the little things that I do for her, that she knew I loved her bc I showed it & that she loved me too, that she loved me kids.. my kids love her.. I made her leave, blocked her on everything and she has tried to call and text multiple times from different numbers. I want to answer so bad. I went to bed early last night, woke up at 4am and she was the very first thought in my mind. I miss her. I love her so fucking much but I can‚Äôt do that to me or my kids. I have cried since I opened my eyes, idk how to make this pain any easier. I‚Äôm so lost rn.

She had BPD, and at the time, I was too much of a coward to handle the complexities of our relationship. I broke up with her because I didn‚Äôt know how to navigate it, and I feel like the biggest fucking pussy for it.

Since then, I‚Äôve been with other women‚Äîone-night stands, dates, different personalities, ages, everything‚Äîbut none of them have ever come close to making me feel even an ounce of what I felt when I first laid eyes on her. I was literally star-struck. It was during lockdown, my friend‚Äôs birthday, and we all had ecstasy pills. Luckily, she was there. We hit it off insanely well. I remember having to chase her around, trying to show her how much I liked her in these stupid, indirect ways because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do (I promise it was in the least-creepy-most-ethical-respectful-way)

We were both in uni, and we used to spend every night together, getting stoned or just chilling. We had this little ritual‚Äîone night we‚Äôd watch TikTok on my FYP, and the next night it‚Äôd be hers. It was so simple, but it felt perfect. Eventually, though, I left uni and went back home. Things just fell apart after that.

Fast forward three years, and I still check her Instagram. She looks really healthy now, and I‚Äôm so, so happy for her. I tried messaging her once, but I didn‚Äôt know she had a girlfriend at the time. She doesn‚Äôt now, but it‚Äôs not like that makes it any easier.

I‚Äôve been doing better in my own way too. I‚Äôve got a full-time job now, and I‚Äôm way more stable than I was back then. I‚Äôve also been locked in at the gym these past few years. It‚Äôs been my sanctuary‚Äîgiving me mental clarity and helping me stay focused. But even with all of that, I still can‚Äôt get her out of my head.

I just wish we could get the chance to experience the better versions of ourselves‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs catching up over something as small as coffee or just talking about life.

I look for her in every single person I go out with. I‚Äôve tried to forget her, and sometimes it works‚Äîfor a while. But then she‚Äôll show up in my dreams, out of nowhere, and I‚Äôm back at square one.

I am completely and utterly in love with this woman. I don‚Äôt know what to do with these feelings anymore. This is just a rant, but if anyone has advice or even just words that might help, I‚Äôd really appreciate it.",0,1733655825.0,self,1,0.5,False

I met my (30f) partner (32m) a few months after I lost my mum. I am waiting on an autism assessment too, it's taken a while to get the ball rolling with this since I've had depression since I was a child and hadn't had much consideration for what's wrong with me through the years other than a feeling I was ""defective"".

When we began dating, I was vulnerable for the first time in my life. I lost my mum, I gave up a flat I had with an ex who was not supportive of my loss (a few other things came to light that changed my feelings of him) and i moved back to my dad's place. During all of this, I was going through university, looking after my dad who has heart issues and ongoing leg/knee problems, working and looking after my dog. I felt burnt out, but the constant pressure from everywhere in life kept me occupied so I didn't have to think about my loss.

I was so careful to get into this relationship. I gave him so many chances to leave as I said to him I didn't feel like I could recover from being messed around - and he would give me so many signs that he had other women on the go. After we hung out, he'd go AWOL from say 11pm - 9am, or the weekends we never saw eachother he would stop replying about 6pm on weekends and reply the following morning/noon.

It came to light that in the first 10 months of our relationship, he was sleeping with 4 other women - that I know of. He lied consistently, but I'll give a breakdown

He said we were exclusive - my friend sent me his dating profile.
He said he ""just looked"" on the apps - until I mentioned the app saves information and he freaked out. Telling me he spoke to a former fwb.
When I pressed to see the messages, this turned into sexting.
One woman came forward to admit they were sleeping together, and he tried to gaslight me into believing we were exclusive from May, so it was okay to sleep with her in March.
The reality was that we were exclusive in March and he met her in May.
His excuse for the other two women was that he didn't know how to end it. As he didn't want to hurt anyone.
He kept his beautiful, rich ex around that be broke up with, but didn't tell her about me. Because he didn't want to hurt her feelings as she was ""vulnerable"". Everything that happened to her happened to me too. Between the years of bullying and physical attacks ar school, so SA from older people, to being in toxic relationships and being the carer for a terminally sick parent. It felt like she was praised for her resilience and he didn't want to upset her, but he was so happy to step all over my blind faith in him.

I chose to stay. I was alone. I didn't have my mum, and I don't have much of a support network - my friends are amazing but I only have a few and they all have so much going on in their own lives. This is just a burden for anyone to listen to.

I became so verbally abusive to him. When everything came out - on the same day - I threw his phone at him. I've called him everything under the sun. It's been a year and he's done what he can. He's changed his number, cut contact with everyone he slept with and spoke to, and blocked his ex (he told me that she knew about me and as she was sending him photos of her going out in dresses etc, and then snuck out to meet her a few days before I found out about his cheating, I lost it and sent her abuse as he made it look like she was disrespecting me, and I sent her evidence he cheated on her too).

This is messy. I became so toxic. It feels like I used this relationship to distract myself from my problems in life. He's never begged me to stay. He actually tried arranging to fuck someone else one of the times I dumped him. But this person he arranged to meet was an entirely new person he failed to disclose.

It has been a year of coffee in bed, doing things with our pets, inside jokes, falling asleep in one another's arms and organising dates for eachother. I'm just so scared to trust him again. I give him so much grief for last year. I can't stop fighting him and I habe thrown things at him like 4 times. I think this is abusive of me, but I never threw things to hit him. I would aim beside him and it was after things came to light that he lied about.

He let's his friends call him abusive, I don't know if they are just as bad, or if he's downplayed what he's put me through. He tells his friends he's ""checked out"" because of how emotional I've become this last year, but he talks to me about moving in together next year, kids names, marriage etc. I do want that. But even after he cheated on me, he never chased me.

I dont know why that matters so much. There was no grandiose attempt to get me back. No spamming my phone, no flowers, no begging me to stay or anything. But he breaks up with me at least once a month for my emotional outbursts and I beg for him to stay.

I need help. I have never loved someone this much and I know its a trauma bond. It breaks my heart how easily he leaves, but when things are good he tells me how he's never felt this way and how it's scary etc.

We broke up 2 nights ago because he was half an hour late. He made out he was at the venue we agreed to meet and I ran there in heels in the rain. He wasn't there. He was at a bar with his old fwb (married with kids now) who I've met and she is really nice. I wish I could be uncomfortable about that but he has so many other red flags that she doesn't even come into my mind as a concern, despite her saying she got with her husband to make him jealous and apparently said she loves him, and also SA'd him once about 10 years ago. I threw an umbrella at him in tears as he didn't want to deal with me being emotional. It is important to note that around this time last year, everything about the other women came out. And someone posted about a man matching his description on the same Facebook page that I found them on earlier this day. I hadn't been able to confront him as I was at work when I saw this and I don't even know if it was about him, but the name and location matched.

As I type this out, it feels unbelievable that I even want this person, but I do. I am in therapy as last year traumatised me. But I want him to realise the depth of the damage that he did. When I feel angry I feel like he deserves the abuse I gave him. I have so much anger and hatred. But most of the time I'm just feeling sad and guilty for the way I've spoke to him and want to be a better person.

Before all of this unfurled last year, he said I was the ""easiest"" relationship he had ever been in. I was low maintenance and fun. I'm not that person anymore. His sexual past disgusts me. His cheating disgusts me. I don't know how to be the person I was last year. He slept with someone the night before my birthday. The same week he said he loved me for the first time.

He blocked me off everything again. For good this time. But he plans to call me at noon. One hour from now.

Please help. I don't know what to say. I want to be a better person. I want to be the people pleasing, joker friend that had a social life and ambition. I want to stay with him. I need to learn to trust him. But there's so much scar tissue I need to get through in order for my head to be clear again and he doesn't seem to realise how unfair it is that I habe this inner conflict while he sits idly by in the aftermath of his actions. He will never beg me to stay. He doesn't care to. He sees his actions, he just seems to think I should be able to move past it, without realising when you love someone these things have a horrible, lasting impact on you.

If anyone has been in a similar situation where they have displayed abusive traits after infidelity, please let me know. I don't recognise myself. There's so much good about our relationship that I want to fight for but at this point it is my actions and my attitude that is the problem.

==================================================

When we talk about dental aesthetics, veneers often come up as a popular solution for transforming smiles. These thin shells of porcelain or composite resin can do wonders for one‚Äôs appearance, hiding imperfections and creating that Hollywood smile. However, an issue that frequently arises in conversations around veneers is whether they might contribute to bad breath. This article will unravel the mystery surrounding veneers and their potential link to halitosis (the medical term for bad breath).

Understanding Dental Veneers
----------------------------

Before diving into the relationship between veneers and bad breath, it's essential to understand what veneers are. Dental veneers are custom-made shells that fit over the front surface of teeth to improve their appearance. They're primarily used to correct issues like:

- Discolored teeth
- Chipped or worn-down teeth
- Misaligned or irregularly shaped teeth
- Gaps between teeth

Veneers can be made from porcelain or composite resin, both materials having their unique advantages. Porcelain veneers are known for their durability and stain resistance, while composite veneers are less expensive and can be applied in a single visit.

### The Procedure: What to Expect

Getting veneers is no walk in the park. The process usually involves several steps:

1. **Consultation:** You‚Äôll discuss your goals with your dentist.
2. **Preparation:** Some enamel may need to be removed to create space for the veneers.
3. **Impressions:** Your dentist will take impressions of your teeth to ensure the veneers fit perfectly.
4. **Fabrication:** The veneers are crafted in a lab, which can take a week or so.
5. **Bonding:** Once ready, the veneers are bonded to your teeth using a special adhesive.

While the aesthetic benefits of veneers are clear, some patients worry about the practical aspects, such as whether they can lead to bad breath.

Do Veneers Cause Bad Breath?
----------------------------

Now, let‚Äôs get straight to the point: ‚ÄúDo veneers cause bad breath?‚Äù The short answer is not directly, but there are several factors at play that could potentially lead to bad breath if not properly managed.

### The Role of Oral Hygiene

One of the primary concerns that link veneers and bad breath is oral hygiene‚Äîor rather, the lack thereof. Veneers don‚Äôt inherently produce bad breath, but neglecting your oral care routine can lead to issues that do.

- **Bacterial Growth:** Food particles can get trapped around the edges of veneers or between your teeth, providing a cozy home for bacteria. As these bacteria break down food particles, they release foul-smelling compounds, leading to bad breath.
- **Gum Health:** If you have underlying gum issues, they can exacerbate bad breath. Gum disease can occur when plaque builds up along the gum line, causing infections that produce unpleasant odors.

### Maintenance: Keeping Your Smile Fresh

To keep bad breath at bay, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain good dental hygiene practices, especially after getting veneers. Here are some tips to help you stay fresh:

1. **Brush Twice Daily:** Use fluoride toothpaste and a soft-bristled brush. Get in those nooks and crannies!
2. **Floss Regularly:** Floss is your friend. It helps remove food particles and plaque from hard-to-reach areas.
3. **Use Mouthwash:** An antibacterial mouthwash can help reduce bacteria in your mouth, promoting fresher breath.
4. **Stay Hydrated:** Dry mouth can lead to bad breath, so drink plenty of water throughout the day.
5. **Regular Dental Checkups:** Visit your dentist regularly for cleanings and checkups to catch any issues early on.

By following these steps, you can dramatically reduce your chances of experiencing bad breath.

Common Myths About Veneers and Bad Breath
-----------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs face it; dental myths run rampant, and veneers are no exception. Here are a few common misconceptions about veneers that might be raising eyebrows:

### Myth 1: Veneers Are Impervious to Stains

While porcelain veneers are resistant to stains, they‚Äôre not completely impervious. Over time, exposure to foods like coffee, tea, or red wine can discolor them. Stained veneers can be less attractive, but they won‚Äôt directly cause bad breath.

### Myth 2: You Don‚Äôt Need to Floss with Veneers

This one‚Äôs a biggie! Many people think that because veneers cover the teeth, flossing isn‚Äôt necessary. Wrong! Flossing is critical‚Äîespecially around the gums. Neglecting this step can lead to gum disease, which is a known culprit of bad breath.

### Myth 3: All Bad Breath Comes from the Mouth

Surprisingly, that's not always true. Conditions such as sinus infections or digestive issues can also contribute to bad breath. So, if you‚Äôve got bad breath despite excellent dental hygiene, it might be time to consult a healthcare professional.

How to Identify Bad Breath Caused by Veneers
--------------------------------------------

Since we're all about the nitty-gritty details, recognizing the signs of bad breath related to veneers can save you from awkward encounters and social faux pas. Here are some tell-tale signs to watch for:

1. **Unpleasant Odor:** If you notice a persistent bad smell, it could mean there‚Äôs something amiss.
2. **Taste Changes:** A metallic or unusual taste in your mouth may indicate bacterial buildup or something else brewing.
3. **Red or Swollen Gums:** These symptoms can signal gum disease, which can also lead to bad breath.
4. **Sensitivity:** While veneers shouldn‚Äôt be sensitive, discomfort might indicate underlying issues affecting breath.

What to Do If You Have Bad Breath From Veneers
----------------------------------------------

Discovering that your veneers might be linked to bad breath can be alarming. But fear not! Here‚Äôs what you can do:

### Step 1: Re-evaluate Your Oral Hygiene Routine

Take a moment to assess whether you‚Äôre doing everything you can to keep your mouth healthy. Are you brushing sufficiently, and are you using mouthwash?

### Step 2: Schedule a Dental Appointment

Your dentist is your best ally in this situation. They can provide professional cleaning and check for any underlying problems.

### Step 3: Consider Dietary Changes

Sometimes, certain foods can exacerbate bad breath. Try cutting back on odor-causing foods like garlic and onions, and see if it makes a difference.

### Step 4: Explore Additional Treatment Options

If bad breath persists despite your efforts, speak to your dentist about possible treatments. They might suggest specialized mouthwashes or even periodontal treatments for gum issues.

The Connection Between Gum Health and Bad Breath
------------------------------------------------

We've mentioned gum health several times, and for a good reason. Maintaining healthy gums is crucial for fresh breath. When gums are inflamed due to plaque buildup or gum disease, they can emit a foul odor. Here‚Äôs how you can promote gum health alongside your veneers:

### Signs of Healthy Gums

- **Pale Pink Color:** Healthy gums should be a pale pink shade.
- **Firm Texture:** They shouldn‚Äôt be swollen or bleeding when you brush or floss.
- **No Bad Breath:** Simply put, if your breath stays fresh, your gums are likely in good shape.

### Tips to Maintain Gum Health

- **Use an Antibacterial Toothpaste:** This can help reduce plaque buildup.
- **Don‚Äôt Skip the Dentist:** Regular cleanings are vital.
- **Avoid Tobacco Products:** Smoking can harm your gums and worsen bad breath.

Final Thoughts: Keeping Your Smile‚Äîand Breath‚ÄîFresh
---------------------------------------------------

In conclusion, ‚ÄúDo veneers cause bad breath?‚Äù The evidence suggests that while veneers themselves don‚Äôt directly lead to halitosis, neglecting oral hygiene can certainly put you at risk. By maintaining a robust oral care routine, you can enjoy the aesthetic benefits of your veneers without the discomfort of bad breath.

Remember, your dentist is your partner in keeping your smile healthy and radiant. Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out for help whenever you feel something might be off. So, go ahead, flaunt that smile with confidence!

It still hasn't opened up. He was out to get some sunlight. He remembers how evening shifts and no exposure to sun had yielded effect as joint pains last year. But the day was as gloomy as it becomes during storms. Monsoon had already arrived it seems. Such a mood really makes one crave spiced chai and smoke. But there weren't any chai shops nearby to soothe his cravings. He had to settle on just a smoke. Lighting a cigarette he took a drag and letting the spiced taste hit his upper throat, made his eyes close. Tilting his head to get a look at the dark clouds he exhaled. Smoke was in front of his face, opaquely hiding the shops in front of him as he tried to see across the road. A caf√© came into view as the smoke cleared. Amber shaded lamps hung on the dark brown walls gave the caf√© an antique view. He remembered this caf√© had great mutton cutlet and caramel custard. His craving for chai had definitely found a home. Crossing the street he entered the caf√© and ordered a chai at the counter while he walked inside. The caf√© was beautiful from inside, a contrast kept at every visible surface to make it look aesthetically antique. All chairs and tables were dark brown matching the walls and tablecloth, white and red chequered with a beige colored flower vase kept atop. There was a blackboard kept on the wall for the dishes of today. It read, Mutton cutlet, chicken cutlet, chicken fry, cream soda, chai, coffee, caramel custard written in white chalk. There was a great rusty vibe to the place. But as he walked inside he found all the chairs empty. There was one cook, who was not visible but the noise of gas and a ladle clanging against the pot made his presence clear. And then there was the cashier at the counter who was apparently gazing into distance with some incense burning beside him on his counter. Still trying to figure out why is the place so empty he looked around. He saw someone sitting at the center table, midnight blue T-shirt with their back towards him, sipping on what seemed to be cream soda. A black cap lay on table alongside a small waist pouch. There was a bowl of caramel custard already on the table waiting to be dug into. They might be alone, he assumed. He was not much of a social person and would love to sit alone at another table but he felt like he should be sitting there, right beside them not across but beside them. He walked towards the table and sat beside them in the empty chair. *I should be socializing with this person,  I have sat beside them. I don't want to make them uncomfortable,* he thought to himself. Suddenly feeling conscious about his appearance he took a glance towards his shirt and jeans and started talking, ""Hey... I am just getting chai. I will just sit for a while...."". His breaking words and trembling voice had exposed his confidence. He couldn't make eye contact with such a nervous sentence. And there was no response from the person either. He had to make small talk. So he cleared the lump formed in his throat and tried talking again, ""I will just finish my chai...The weather is gloomy outside."" He turned his face towards them trying to make it less awkward. While slowly lifting his face up, he came to realize it was a girl. Short yet perfectly stout. He gasped as his eyes fell upon the face. There was nothing at all. It was a clear white light, stinging in his eyes. He tried to narrow his eyes but it was just stinging his eyes to keep focus and looking what it was. Instinctively he raised his hands and tried to touch the face to get an idea of the features of the face. *I don't understand why am I even doing this.* But he couldn't touch it. The more he tried, the more it felt distant like it was constantly repelling his touch. He got up in a hurry and ran backwards looking at this absurdism. He went to the cashier. Hurriedly he tried speaking to the cashier, ""What is that?...Forget it! cancel my order!"" But the cashier didn't even flinch,sitting still as a statue. He lifted his wrists and curled into a ball to knock on the counter when his gaze fall on a notepad which was surprisingly was kept straight as if meant to read. It read:

He felt a sharp sting in his eye as the he had ignored the incense stick burning beside the notepad. The smoke engulfed his vision. And then a waft blew across his face. He opened his eyes, his eyes were watery. He was leaning on his back to the wall. He closed his eyes again to loose the teary eyes. The cigarette in his hand was still burning.

I have some trauma counselling next month but need to get this out before I see him after work.

Where to even begin... my dad is jealous of us, his own daughter and wife. Shes not allowed to have a coffee with me for an hour it's has to be under. We work together and that means we spend too much time together. She is too soft with me, my sister, the kittens and dog. He hates the kittens and never wanted them, even though he agreed to have them. 

He's a hoarder, the house is a mess with his belongings everywhere and maintenance is needed but we're not allowed to get external help. No, he has to do it yet he never does. The insulation fell through the roof of the extension and its still open after 3 years.

The garden is full of stuff and we cant have family over because it's a mess. He moans at his wife for taking her sister to the hospital for appointments and for buying her a coffee after.  

He is physically abusive and I don't trust him with anyone when angry so I make sure I'm near by when they argue but if I get involved I'm being nosey and need to mind my business. Never mind that the neighbours can hear him, so how can I not? He has hit me and my mother in the not so distant past.

To the point of me wondering what would have been if both my Asian parents don't have severe issues. Would I have been happy? It made me contemplate of the life of the what IFs. I know I shouldn't and just face realistic but this.... Is just painful.

Context: As a child my parents never ever just plain believed me. To a certain degree they did that to teach me to have sources and double check. But now, it has just became toxic. Till the point I have to prepare a argument every single time to prove even the fact that I was the one that turned off the lights. And not someone else. (We only have 3 people in the home at all times)

At a coffee shop that's extremely crowded, I was waiting for my take out cake. The rare moments that I could treat myself and have peace away from my parents.

A family all Asian speaking Cantonese even, came into the shop. At first I didn't notice much but then they started to find a place to sit whilst holding a ton of luggage. The parents speaking in Chinese asked their child that looks around 5-6 to go and check out the second floor of the cafe for empty seats. The child did as told and after coming back to their parents said there aren't any free seats. Without any hesitation, the parents didn't scold or even second guess their child. With full trust and love they said it's okay, and thanked them for checking out the place. And without arguments just went away and gone out the coffee shop.

The first thing in my brain was to second guess the child if they are wrong. But that's when I caught myself. I have been conditioned to the point that's the first thing I would think about.

It hit me like a huge wave of guilt and just pure sadness. When I heard the family speaking the same language as me I already assumed they werengoing to be the typical Asian parents, but no. And this, just made me feel absolutely distraught. I guess there are Asian parents that actually are good. Normal even. Not filled with trauma that they project ont obtheir kids. Nothing. That split second, that entire thing....just made me think of all the possibilities if my parents aren't the way that they are. If they aren't laced with baggage, would I have grown up happy. Trauma free. I rather be a spoiled brat and hit by societies expectations and ruthlessness than to grow up like this, in this toxic household.

But yeah. In another perspective, I guess I can say not everyone has bad Asian parents. Some of them have good lives and maybe if I ever become a mother I can be one of those good few. I guess we were just unlucky to have parents like these.

The holidays are coming soon, so I hope you all have some kind of warmth and love sent to your way.

I‚Äôve had GERD for the past maybe 12 years (I‚Äôm now 30). At first I would just get a cough after drinking wine or any other kind of alcohol. As time went I started to get flareups, I‚Äôd take some medicine and move on.

Around 2 years ago I got such a huge flare that medicine did not work, even drinking water made it worse. I‚Äôd eat oatmeal made with just water and salt and cry, because it would burn and make me dry heave. All the test showed that my stomach was okay. So the problem was not with the sphincter. I lost 7 kg (around 15 pounds) in less than 3 weeks. I couldn‚Äôt eat.

After a good half a year the symptoms became managable. I was able to eat different kinds of foods and not be in constant pain. After a year from the flare up I went to the doctor cause I still would feel the constant GERD symptoms (though not so bad that I would cry everyday like before). The doctor found that the sphincter was not working properly. I was ordered to take 80 mg (40 in the morning and 40 in the evening) of Esomeprazolum. I‚Äôve been doing that since. That was a year ago.

Everytime I tried to start taking just 40 mg per day, I would feel the symptoms. Mostly it‚Äôs the burning in my throat and coughing. I even have the same syptoms with the 80 mg just they are not so big.

I want to stop taking such huges amounts of pills. I‚Äôve been already diagnosed with vitamin b12 deficiancy due to taking ppis.

I need advice how to do that. Please.

I don‚Äôt drink coffee, alcohol, I don‚Äôt smoke. I drink a cup of matcha per day (with almond milk). I know what my food triggers are: bread, pastries, dairy, anything fatty and so on. I don‚Äôt indulge a lot, but sometimes I let myself eat a burger or pain au chocolate and so on. Because I still wake up everymorning with the taste of acid in my mouth even if I don‚Äôt eat burgers.

I (17F) and my boss (42M) have been working together since I was 15, over this period we have gotten very close. My boss has been friends with my dad since they were in there late 20s so I have often seen him in my house while my dad has had late nights where they drink. I noticed he always tried to talk to me and I did find him very attractive. At work I often purposely wear short dresses or clothing to see if he looks.

I went to leave when he told me he had sinething else he wanted from me. He told me to do exactly what he said. His office was on the 17th floor with a wide open window qnd he asked me to give him a show. Knowing this was my chance I knew exactly what to do. I took my shirt off and pushed my large breasts against the window. I pulled me shirt up and began to feel my leg have c#m drip down. I began to moan very loudly as he left down to lick it up. As I felt his young moving up my leg I began to get exited as I had never had s#x before and was extremely exited. I felt my skirt being lifted up and my thong moved out of the way. The feeling of his young licking my lips made me feel extremely good. He asked me to f#nger myself so of coarse u did. With all fingers in my v@gina I felt very good.

Please help I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs a Sunday here in the UK/ if i ring my doctors all they‚Äôll do is tell me to stop taking them, they‚Äôve exhausted everything they can do/ prescribe at their level. 

Constipation since January 2023. My symptoms have changed and progressed over the time. Now completely laxative resistant (and has been for almost a year). 

It‚Äôs suspected slow bowel transit but the NHS are TERRIBLE dragging their feet. (Couldn‚Äôt do a colonoscopy as the meds wouldn‚Äôt work even with increased dose/ low fibre, had anorectal studies and still awaiting results). 

Specialist recently prescribed me Linaclotide approx 1.5 months ago, made no change to consistency of my poo, still rock hard, still incredibly painful. Gastro specialist discharged me as he was just a local community one who can literally only book colonoscopies then refer you on to somewhere else, and referred me back to colorectal specialist I‚Äôd met before when admitted in A&E in June. Said after a month if no change start sodium picosulfate as well as the linalcotide. So been on that approx 1.5 weeks. First two days violent diarhea, still painful, still painful to sit down. Since then it‚Äôs stopped working. Back to before, actually probably worse incredibly painful, constantly feel like I need to poo, when I managed to force anything it‚Äôs balls. 
 
I know I‚Äôm dehydrated AF I feel terrible. My mouth every morning is like it‚Äôs been sucked of all moisture in the night. I feel ‚Äúoff‚Äù. I‚Äôm hardly peeing, maybe 4-5 times a day, but it‚Äôs a fine stream as if something pressing against my urethra and my pees brown. 

I‚Äôm drinking minimum 1.7l of water plus a coffee every morning, then approx another 1.2l on an afternoon and whatever other drinks I have on top. 

Last time I was like this I ended up hospitalized for 3 days, where they couldn‚Äôt get my blood as I was too dehydrated (this was after a GP prescribed me 5 different laxatives to take in one day). They weren‚Äôt fussed whatsoever over the dehydration as I was drinking plenty and returned to normal (having stopped the laxatives). 

On another note I can‚Äôt take any macrogels (I was on them long term with doctors keep changing me from 2 - 8 sachets a day as nothing was working) as I developed an intolerance to them and when I take them they make me have horrendous headaches and pass out multiple times. Every time it‚Äôs taken them minimum 3 weeks for a blood test after putting me on/ stopping them and they say my electrolytes are normal. 

I just want to go to the toilet, not be in pain when I do, not be consciously aware of the pressure in my bum at all times, and be able to sit down and not feel in pain. ",1,1733654170.0,ConstipationAdvice,1,1.0,False

Many years ago a met an amazing person from the LGBTQIA+ community and we‚Äôve managed to build an amazing friendship. Like mind blowing for me that there was a person who could get me so well and with whom we‚Äôve had so much in common, especially in terms of life views, experiences etc. We‚Äôve been inseparable for years, talking like literally every hour via texts etc, many calls or video chats over the course of those blissful years.

Unfortunately their romantic relationship ended with a long term partner and they started distancing themselves from everyone. I know they weren‚Äôt just distancing themselves from me, but from the world altogether. We‚Äôve managed to survive this more or less, but I already started feeling that something is not right, their spirit was severed (the loss of this relationship was tremendous, and it was mostly because that breakup was totally avoidable and it wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúfault‚Äù of either partners - there was a child from another relationship that was sawing seeds of ruin and it worked). Nonetheless I did my best, despite not being perfect in any way or form, to ease their pain and show support.

With time I saw a glimmer of hope to regain the ‚Äúold relationship‚Äù we had, but unfortunately they started distancing themselves again. This time I didn‚Äôt know why and every time we talked I got 0 information from them about their life and whatever I would share about mine ended with their criticism (whether accurate or warranted, is a different story) about my life choices, my inability to conquer obstacles and generally move on with my life. Now that was years before my Asperger‚Äôs & CPTD diagnosis, so I really did believe that I‚Äôm fucked up since I cannot do the things they were recommending me to resolve my issues.

Unfortunately they started distancing themselves further to the point that we‚Äôd be talking maybe once per week and it‚Äôd be just some shallow text message exchange. Ultimately I did voice my concern about the distancing and asked what‚Äôs going on, why they aren‚Äôt talking to me anymore. They informed me that they have started a new relationship and need to focus on it, they don‚Äôt want to talk about it in order to not jinx it etc. While I did understand the fear of jinxing a relationship, I did feel pushed aside (again) for no obvious reason. By that time we‚Äôd been best friends for years and so I thought this level of trust and understanding could conquer those fears.
But I was wrong.

Eventually we just ‚Äúnaturally‚Äù stopped talking as it was months between texts. Fast forward few years, till last year around Christmas, I just felt another time a tremendous loss and this feeling of missing them so much, so I decided to write to them a text. I didn‚Äôt understand it at that time, but I decided to take the blame on me for the lack of contact just in hope of rekindling the friendship. I sent a long text with an apology and explanation that I was going through a lot etc and that I am sorry that I failed my promise to never abandon them. They replied that they were surprised by my text, we‚Äôve agreed to have a call and talked for like 2 hours straight just playing surface level catch-up. I learned that their relationship (the one which caused them to further distance themselves from me) unfortunately ended and that now they are enjoying a single life. We‚Äôve agreed to meet for a coffee etc and I promised that I will earn their trust back. And to be honest with you, dear people, I really believed that.

Took me couple of weeks to realize nothing has changed and that they are still distancing themselves from me. In all fairness they did tell me that me stopping contact with them broke their heart and trust in people and now they do not trust anybody at all. I tried my best to text every morning, but I just couldn‚Äôt stomach the surface level of nothingness, while remembering the amazingly deep and vulnerable conversations we used to have. And just one morning I didn‚Äôt text, and so they didn‚Äôt too. I did the same the next day, hoping that maybe they‚Äôd put in an effort, but nothing. And so passed around 11 months since I last sent a text to them and there‚Äôs no word from them.

Until last week, I did feel like the worst person in the world. I believed I had broken a promise, to not abandon them, twice and lived with the struggle of that. But something changed, last week I realized I am angry at them. That while yes, I did stop fighting for this friendship twice, I wasn‚Äôt the first to stop. They were and it fucking sucks. Up until that point it was the best friendship I had in my life and I fucking miss it a lot. I miss that feeling of safety, trust & understanding we had until their heart was broken and they never recovered. And I miss that spark they used to have in their eyes and I would do anything to get it back, anything but sacrificing myself again and again and again in hopes of rekindling it. A friendship works two ways and it should be two (or more) people caring for its growth, not just one.

So yeah, I miss them deeply but I‚Äôm still angry, because they decided to shut down and never let me back in. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the worst person in the world for not fighting harder, but despite my anger at them I do feel ashamed of giving up. I wish they‚Äôd let me back in, but I just can‚Äôt carry all the weight myself. It‚Äôs just too much‚Ä¶",1,1733654118.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Just a little trivia too. I have only had sex once in my life and it went bad (it is kind of overrated and I wish I would have waited to be honest). I have had many jobs and been used at each one and have pretty much nothing to show for it.

While I say sex is overrated, I've never had sex with someone I am super-hot-for or invested in. Nutting is also great or the dopamine rush from it. So, sex could be addicting if the girl actually gets me to cum. I do have the intention of replacing it with porn though (want a gf). I may however fall into an addiction because I do have a problem with dopamine and nutting. I won't know until I get there.

These events are not in chronological order either. I am also intentionally not going into extended detail and unintentionally with some stuff. I can't give exact dates for any of it maybe age ranges but nothing exact. I have never been good with remembering dates.

Vegas 8-18 years old

\++++++++++++++

During elementary school I hit my head on a pull-up bar. I was chasing someone playing tag. I had turned around because someone called my name. I hit my head hard enough that the following night I was laying on the couch/sofa and dizzy, lightheaded, and nauseous. I remember not eating that night because it ruined my appetite. I remember getting up to go to the restroom and walking there alone using the wall to brace me. I remember not being able to piss despite feeling like I had to piss. It was a strange feeling, and I ended up sitting down on the toilet waiting to gain enough energy to walk back to the sofa. I ended up sleeping on the couch that night if I remember correctly. I couldn't make it upstairs to my room, it sapped all my strength.

As I have said in other posts the neighbors brought over muffins and I remember answering the door with my brother or parents. I remember having the distinct feeling of not being able to trust the muffins. One of them scoffed as the door closed for whatever reason. It was a very rude scoff in my opinion. I was only seven years old at the time so my judgement may have been off. It was a first-time experience perhaps so I can‚Äôt say I gaged it right. The fact is though whatever the reason he did it. He scoffed and that is rude or immature just like they claimed I was at the time. There is no real excuse for it. I also remember having this feeling that we couldn‚Äôt trust the muffins (like they were poison, or the gesture was fake which is a type of poison). Not a single one was eaten if I remember all trashed.

The same neighbors pinned me to a wall and threatened my life for messing with their sister and brother. I was a perverted kid, mostly on the curious side, lack of understanding also. I got ahold of porn and was just imitating what I saw (without comprehending the emotional side of it). I might not have been able to comprehend the emotional side of it because I was also being coerced and screwed with by someone in my family.

My parents were constantly yelling at me because of the school system (my homework and grades). I often didn‚Äôt do it or even try to do it because I didn‚Äôt understand it at the time. Their yelling didn‚Äôt really help because it creates a state of fear or overwhelm. Which I guess had an effect on my memory abilities. It certainly made me not want to do the schoolwork at all. There would be other fights also, with chores, and all the mischief I got into.

I once lit the carpet on fire 100% on accident. I lit a Kleenex on fire, the kind with lotion added to it. I didn‚Äôt know it had lotion added to it. The embers flew off when I let go of it because it was about to burn me. They flew a good 10-15 feet away from me and the carpet lit on fire. Luckily it burned slow, and I got water quick enough. My mom was taking a tub bath at the time. Didn‚Äôt need to see all that but I don‚Äôt really care. It isn‚Äôt like it was sexual or anything and it never was never could be either not into doing that and have no attraction to direct family.

My grandpa once fell over when he was going to use the restroom on a portable toilet. He was nude (I believe he didn‚Äôt have a shirt on) and I saw his junk. Helped him up off the ground and went back to sleep. Never spoke of it again after that. I did get a thankyou from him once for it. Left him to himself after the fact, it wasn‚Äôt super bad.

Fed our family dog oleander or a branch or something (I didn't know that it would do what it was going to do). I was trying to make a point that animals will do anything you tell them to do. That same dog is the one that protected me in Hawaii from the other dog. She did the same thing up here with another dog we owned. The loyalty of animals is insanely high, I suspect that is why I love that dog. She showed me what love is in some way, just realized it. That dog also nipped me on the face because I was sitting on her back once when I was little. Which is fine whatever, she didn‚Äôt try to bite me. She got me though which made me have a little more respect for animals. I used to sit at the top of the stairs talking to that dog. I even apologized to her for things I did. When she almost died, I started watching my behavior even more started to realize I needed to have more control. She would have died because of me, and nobody would have known it was me. I would have had to keep it a secret had she of died. That is one secret that would have ruined me. I looked forward to seeing her when I came home from school every day. Chasing her when she had her not, playing fetch with her, just petting her when she was resting and talking to her. Nothing can replace that dog not ever and I hope whatever is in the next life wherever I go, I see her again. Though I have loved all the animals my family has had, this specific dog molded my perceptions and taught me without even knowing it. Funny how something that can‚Äôt speak taught me more than anyone else. Perhaps it is that animals cannot speak that makes them have such a heavy impact on humans.

The person who I was trying to show something with that dog, he didn‚Äôt try to stop me. It was the same with a lot of the mischief. It was usually him or my cousin who either didn‚Äôt stop me or instigated it all. They would blame me when we got caught. I had an obsession with fire when I was younger. I used to use hairspray and lighters and mess around. I would burn the ends of rope and the hair on my arms all the time. That is why the hair is slightly thicker on the inner sides of my wrists. Once was burning rope with the same kid as above and some of it dripped on my foot. Couldn‚Äôt tell anyone about it because I would have gotten in trouble. I got minor burns on other occasions too. With the rope I think he saw it was about to drip on me. He didn‚Äôt say anything to me though. He just let it happen.

Even after getting burned in Hawaii, I still messed with fire. Too be honest though, that memory was never present when I would. There is a lot of stuff that returned to me recently memories wise.

My dad bought weights, and I never used them except to fool around. I might have had he of bought me a power wrack like the ones we used in high school. Just the simple box frame with holes in it. I think part of the reason that I didn‚Äôt work out though, is I didn‚Äôt want to hear criticism, get scolded and other things. I love weightlifting as an adult but don‚Äôt own my own weight set and hate going to the gym. Too many people who aren‚Äôt serious in the slightest or screw with people. I do workout at home with limited weight and other cardio.

Those same people, whose family I messed with, the girl and the boy, their brother was always calling me fag, queer, gay, and other things. He has a hella mean aura, pissed off because he has always been a fatty (I suspect). Their family would say I think he has ADHD, Autism, or other things (that I have it). They also said my family has narcissism and they were going to use that against me, to get back at me for what I did. They also pinned me to the wall and threatened my life twice at 7-12 years old. Along with all the other forms of harassment, and theft which they were always doing. Asking to borrow tools and never returning them, stealing drinks from the fridge, pretty sure them and their friends stole mine and my brothers‚Äô bikes and painted them black, they borrowed a third one to meet up with friends and never returned it. I did break a mountain bike of theirs when we were riding around. I don‚Äôt know how it broke exactly I do know it was an accident or act of God type stuff.

They were always telling people who moved into the community about me, the things I did, and turning them against me. So, I could never have or sustain a lasting friendship. These people went to the same school as me and also spread rumors there. I was in special ed at the time. I do for certain have dyslexia and ADHD or Asperger‚Äôs or some Intellectual Disability which is unknown. It could all be PTSD though, from when they pinned me to the wall and threatened my life, or it may have exasperated the problem. They also did this to gain favor with people and influence over them (as though they are the only victim and or trying to be heroic ""get justice."").

I would write this girl in middle school and high school who only ever wrote one letter for me. Her and the brother of the person who threatened my life talked on the phone once. They said something about me and wouldn‚Äôt tell me what it was. He turned her against me too. The people who did all these things are organized criminals for the most part.

I once showed the younger brother some guns my parents had, and he asked for ammo. The funny thing is that his older brother shot himself in the foot with a friend‚Äôs gun. So, I assume, that they were trying to do the same thing in this situation. All these people do is want to file lawsuits and create situations and instigate situations so they can steer it in the wrong direction get hurt and file a lawsuit. They would threaten lawsuits sometimes for other things when they were angry.

One of the people who screwed with me (within my family). I made her dog get hand shy. I hit him a couple times messed with him when we watched him for a week or two. I took the anger out on the dog which they caused in me. Not the person. Was it right? Hell no. At the time I didn't think about it. Between all the things that kept happening I just lost my s+++ again and took it out on the dog. Plus, that dog used to always try to hump my leg (not that animals understand what they are doing to the degree that we do). Another time with that same person they told me it was okay to play with them with the blankets and then I did it when their parents were around and got scolded. I have mixed feelings about this event in my life. Maybe the dog didn't deserve it. I don't feel I deserve everything that was happening to me at the time. There was for sure retarding going on (as the law calls it).

Their brother that would bully me went from calling me a fag, gay, queer, and other things to calling me a pedophile at one point. You can‚Äôt be a pedophile at 14 or 15 years old, just a pervert at worst. Mind you their brother was having sex when I was over at their house once. With someone I was talking to or at least they tried to make it sound that way.

They were once driving in front of the school bus we were riding in and kept slamming on the brakes making the bus driver hit the brakes harder. We were all sliding forward sometimes because they would abruptly stop by every turn.

There was a kid on the bus who I wouldn‚Äôt let sit next to me when we got off, he hit me in the center of the chest right next to my heart. Not that I really care. It wasn‚Äôt hard enough to make me fall over or even cry. It shook me little because it was the first time someone did that to me. I let him have a free hit arm down and everything. Didn‚Äôt bother to get into a fight with him either. I could have, probably, maybe could have beat him down right there too. We waited for the bus to leave also. This was between two 16‚Äì17-year-olds. But if I could take a direct hit at that age, I can take a hell of a lot more as an adult.

My neighbor shat in a box. I saw him do it. Didn‚Äôt believe he was actually going to do it out in the open. His grandma locked him out of the house.

I shat myself in my friend‚Äôs backyard because I was holding it for too long and his grandma wouldn‚Äôt let me in the house. I was super young, so I didn‚Äôt think about just sitting against the wall and dumping on their rocks and washing it away with water.

I used to borrow movies and go to this lady‚Äôs house down the street who would give me candy. I once got into a jumper with a bunch of little kids. I want to say around 15 years old. It was fun. I thought I could take them on, but they got me (she warned me about it. I remember laughing on the inside. I remember her telling me I told you. I think I smiled because she was right. They all tackled me and everything it's hard when there is like 4-8 of them and you are the only big person, naturally they all attack you animal instincts and all.). I was done after like 15 mins or 30 or so. They drained me for sure. I used to play video games at her house like Alien and Goldeneye 007. She gave me a great deal of relief that I couldn‚Äôt find anywhere else. She let me swim in their pool and pretty much do anything I wanted. It was awesome. She had a lizard; her brother had a red Honda, I think. I once talked about going to sleep and her little girl got undressed. Which was not my intention that memory is very blurry to be honest. I do remember helping her put her clothes back on and my friend freaking out that she got undressed. I had just mentioned that I was tired and wanted to go to sleep. That is the way I remember it. I did end up going home and going to sleep a little bit after.

I took martial arts and got a purple belt. There was a jumper there once too. I got bit by one of the kids in the jumper. Not that I really care. I was told to watch out for him (I don't think I got super angry I just stopped playing in the jumper as a result). He got me at some point. I was focused on something else and laying down. There was a girl there that I gave StarCraft and some music also. Crushed on her pretty hard to be honest. Wonder what ever happened to her to be honest. Someone there got jealous and would try to show off in front of her kicking me and stuff outside. She was the one who got me started on burning cheese in the microwave turning it into crisps. I remember being super shy at the first class that she showed up to. Back then though, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been as serious I didn‚Äôt know what I know now. I do know I got slightly jealous when she started pulling away from me. During those classes I was punched in the gut by a brown belt and someone who took boxing on the palms and gut. The gut punches were nothing but my ki‚Äôs were loud. I wish I could do some of this stuff in private so I can show my real strength. I don‚Äôt like attracting attention to myself though it tends to happen either way, usually. There was a camo or green belt there also who would get assigned to us for self-defense and grab us from behind, and I stomped on his foot. Everyone did the same thing. The girl that I crushed on was assigned to fight me and we would just standoff and do nothing, I believe we encouraged/pressured by our teacher and I did finally some but eventually he just switched pairs he realized I think that we couldn't (internally I wasn‚Äôt because the part of me that liked her didn‚Äôt want to initially) I was being shy and didn‚Äôt want to risk hurting her. It was a fun time. I was in the adult classes because they said I was mature enough. I was 16-18 at the time.

When I was back in Hawaii at one point for a family funeral, we were walking on the beach that night, and I decided to go in the water. I body surfed a little bit and ended up face planting in the sand. I remember coming out of the water and smiling. I didn't laugh because it was all the kids in the family. I played it off like nothing happened. I also remember sitting on the beach and thinking this is wonderful, listening to the waves, sitting with family. The beach didn't have too many good memories originally but that changed it a bit.

For my graduation we ate sushi. I wanted to eat somewhere else, but it was closed. There was an argument in the car and at the time I didn't like sushi. It was just to keep my family happy or appease some of them. That night was kind of stolen from me. I was glad to never have to go back to school again though.

During high school I was pretty much quiet in every class the whole class. I finally failed a class and got dreadful of the conversation or argument with my parents that might ensue. This is because all the prior incidents of fighting over homework and grades. I ended up putting my head down in the class of a teacher I trusted. She had a sub that day of course and so I ended up getting wheeled down to the health office and going home early. I made a huge commotion though and was sweating bullets prior to that class thinking about going home.

My mom kicked me and my sister out of the house one day for not doing our chores like usual. We tried to walk to my grandma's house in the middle of summer as a result. We got a ride from some strangers eventually.

Got into a fight with my father once and he went to fight and attack me, and I ran outside to the middle of the street. I forget what it was about. I was backtalking about something. Fighting with my sister over the computer or something, I think. He was trying to sleep or do something in the office and got pissed off.

My friend robbed someone's house and brought the stuff to my house. I told him if I couldn't get rid of it in time I wasn't going to try and fight or hide it. Our friendship started falling apart after that. He tried to convince me to come with them and do it too. I rejected the invitation to do that stuff because I had changed by that point. I never told on him or turned him. His parents called my house and the police, and I did what I said I was going to do. He got the idea I guess because he had been robbed by people. He had a falling out with the person he robbed and couldn't let go of the anger, so I get that, that is part of why I did some of the bad things which I did. We all have our bad chapters in life, and he was committed I could tell. He was also one of the few friends that I had at the time, so it was a loss for me too in a sense.

I got into a couple scuffles in middle school. I also punched a brick wall, not at full strength though. I was irritated because this punk in one of my classes. The teach let me go outside to cool off and I hit the wall. That same kid as 2-3 months later tried to start something with me as we were exiting the classroom. The teacher was gone, and I pushed the kid into a bookshelf, and he tried to run, and I guess he tripped over himself. I just ended up leaving the classroom and looking at him and how pathetic he was on the ground shaking like a b++++. I could have pummeled him if I wanted but I am not in it for violence. When people don't f+++ off they get what they get eventually. I could see how scared he was though, and I think I scoffed at him before I left like I was originally trying to do. Sometime later down the line another Mexican tries to fight me after we leave, I pushed him into the lockers, and I guess a teach saw us. They were saying stop or something, so I stopped and quit fighting. He was hitting my back, and I honestly didn't feel anything at all. If the teacher didn't break it up eventually, I would have grabbed his leg and pushed him down on the ground and who knows where it would have gone from there. I would have been on top of him. This was all because of the girl I wrote letters to and notes and the punks from my neighborhood spreading rumors and instigating stuff. Least I am pretty sure. I used to talk about this girl's boobs and wanting to have sex in the notes and stuff. I guess some people took offense to that, more likely jealousy, and a stick up their a++.

Lots of people in high school and middle school didn't like me because I was already sexually active or interested. I couldn't help it. I was being coerced by someone within my family. Things happened that left me on the edge of a cliff (in curiosity). What can I saw I wanted more. I went for it. Many of the people who talked about me an played hero ended up sleeping with girls as a result. They have probably slept with countless women, made them feel like dirt when they realize it isn't love, when they are just getting used. That is what it is mostly if you aren't with them still. I am the evil one somehow. F+++ YOU and your skank a++ family. You people and your moralistic anger and hypocrisy, entrapment, and all sorts of scandals and manipulations. Nobody ever asked me about these things though, they just left me to ruminate, judged me, gossiped about me, and threw me under the bus just because I was in special ed and because some things I did that were messed up. They won't tell you about all their bad behaviors and deeds though all the adultery, gossip, lies, theft, and other things they would do. They just smear their targets to play the holier than thou role, so their image gets a boost.

Mind you, all of these are with Mexican, they get up in your s+++ with morals and ethics and are the most insecure mother++++ers, they take everything personal (don't know how to ignore their thoughts). I never instigated anything with them, never talked smack to them, never tried to hurt their feelings. When I don't like people, I keep my mouth shut. Even when I sense the same energy radiating from them that radiates from my enemies. It could be murderer energy, and I just ignore it. They always got to start something though, like the one I pushed into the bookshelf, he was told once to back off. After that I attempted to ignore him to get the point across, and he still persisted. I never start fights with people, but I will f+++ing finish them if I have to. He got me in a tight spot and tried to start something, tried to touch me, and wouldn't piss off so he got what he got. I tried nice, I tried distance, I kept my mouth shut but he just didn't get that I wanted nothing to do with him. I hadn't said a word to him ever prior to these incidents or insulted him even though I could feel the clash of our energy. I never met this kid prior to these incidents. This was over the course of a couple weeks maybe two to three months. For this reason, I will always have aversion to Mexicans. They like to talk smack and do dirty things and then when you do it them, they get butt hurt or turn out to be a total b++++. They don't like being snitched on, but they will run and snitch or tell someone in their gang, so you get jumped or harassed (that is the same thing as snitching dip s+++, just not to the cops). When I don't like people, it isn't a skin color thing. I could care less about how white or brown a person is. It is your attitude and mindset that piss me off, disrespect.

Someone within my family coerced me into kissing them and that escalated into other things. There was never anything beyond touching and kissing though. It took two whole years, maybe more, for this person to get through my defenses. Even after everything I never hurt them or caused trouble for them. They would cause me trouble though, instigate things like getting me to burn plastic on a lamp. This person ended up getting raped by someone, whom I still don't know who it is, I have some ideas but can't be sure. I didn't do anything that day because I froze up between all the yelling at home between my sister, my parents and me about homework and chores, and getting bullied by someone in my neighborhood for things. The person also said they would rape me too. I can't remember if it was before or after I had my life threatened, I can't tell if they were close together or far apart in memory. I assume they are close because I can't put a figure on distance apart.

I found porn pamphlets outside once, I kept them, hid them, and someone told my old man. Most likely my friend who I showed them to (the same ones that did all the other trouble and backstabbing).

Watched porn and jerked-off daily on my brother's computer. Watched all kinds of dirty hentai and actual porn. Probably watched every kind of porn there is at least once. This is before I knew what any of it meant really. Some of it stuck and some of it didn't. Cool Devices #3 I think it was it has the girl in the cat costume at the start and the blonde at the end, some of the Bible Black series (the blonde chicks reminded me of someone I knew used to think of me and that person doing the same thing while watching it, sadly never got to), Teachers Pet, Shin Angel or is it New Angel. I was never really into the chicks with dicks in terms of that actual stuff but sometimes I did get off to the idea of humping the person/character they were humping. I would think yeah, I would hump her too if I could). This was all on Kazza and LimeWire for those who don't know what it is. I would just type in porn or hentai and all sorts of stuff would come up. You sometimes didn't know what you were getting. As a result, I have seen every type of porn there is.

When I watch porn, I think of it as me humping someone, though I can relate to the person actually doing it in terms of someone being hot and me wanting to, them getting to how good it must feel, maybe a little envy there, but not with anime/hentai, as it isn't real). Sometimes it was setting that I like. Sometimes it is the situation or position and style. Sometimes it is the moans of the voice actors. Don't talk to me about this stuff in person, I won't, it is a private affair mostly. I'll message people I don't know if you need someone to talk to. Porn leads you down some pretty dark and despicable paths.

I used to role-play on the computer and say some dirty stuff, often just imitating the porn I watched, drawing from the imagery it created in me. Not really understanding what it was fully (least not on the emotional side. as I was numb/lost from all the other stuff that happened in my life). Not that I really care a lot of it was water sports type stuff and other things. Sex dungeon type stuff. In my older age, the solace, I have become somewhat ashamed of it. There was a girl that was being abused at the time that I talked to. Kind of wonder what happened to her. Hope she made it out honestly. Not sure it was actually real at the time, just thought it was someone my age screwing around on the other side, like me. Sometimes I did jerk off too. In hindsight probably a bad idea I never knew who was on the other side, could have been some dude typing the stuff up. Not that it matters I would just think of the girls i wanted in school.

Built a snowman in 2009 with a girl at her house. We were alone. I am actually quite fond of this memory to be honest. She wanted me to hump her I am pretty sure. I didn't. I wasn't into her like that. It wasn't the first time I was alone with her either. She once went in the shower. I wasn't into her like that (though if she asked me directly, I might have). Strangely enough, I miss my friendship with her. Probably because she was into me or crushed on me hard. I think if I could go back, I might have done it there, to know, to find out, but I was too worried about what other people might think. Not just because of how she looked but because of all the other stuff that went on in my life also. I once called her ugly and then everything fell apart from there. I don't know, perhaps it was for the better, I didn't share the feelings she had for me. I do have some love for her now, not of the physical desire sort, just those soft moments. Making 2009 memorable after it snowed that year, and we graduated. Saved my lunch money and gave it to her to buy a skateboard that she wanted. She ended up trying to give it back. She gave me a wall scroll of the FF7 character Tifa. I once tried to give it back to her because I realized I don't really deserve it, and she seemed to have a bit of trouble parting with it. If I ever have power or money and she needs help and asks I'll see what I can do. Out of respect for her character and choices in the past. She was a swimmer and had a smoking body at the time. I am a face guy, and her face just wasn't what I wanted. I understand her heart now to a degree too, what it must have felt like, my behavior, I also have a picture of what I want in terms of female character because of her. Funny that she was atheist at the time. I don't know about now. But you can really pick up perception and perspective from people you don't like. Wherever you are I hope you are doing good, life is treating you good, I hope. This girl was also a virgin and even knowing that at the time and perhaps because of it, the good part of me, the part that loved women, didn‚Äôt. I am good. Not going to run around stealing people's virginity. There is nothing cool about it in my opinion.

I had no sex throughout middle school or high school so all these bad things, all that got me through them, were my faith and jerking off to numb my brain. Always had God in my heart even if I am not exactly saintly. Writing the girl letters helped a little too. Talking to her on the phone. Felt stabbed in the side when she told me she was pregnant. I finally experienced jealousy, but I let it go because that meant she had responsibilities and loved someone else.

My cousin a female would sleep over at our house all the time. Never did anything to her. I have a sister that lots of people consider hot. I never did anything to her. Me and my sister would get into fights all the time. My cousin would instigate mischief and then blame me when we got caught. I still never hurt either of them. That is the person i am at my core. I did call my sister a bitch a couple times. She‚Äôd always get me in trouble for things and it took me years before I did say it (like porn).

The girl I wrote letters to all the time. I also gave her gifts. I sent her a bottle of Patron once an $80 bottle across the states to Virginia. I never got anything in return for it. I never got angry at her for anything until 2014 give or take a couple years (not sure exactly when). Sent her a nasty letter, very rude, I believe there was also a letter that I rubbed my dick all over before I wrote it.

In these years approximately seven people in my family died all in a couple years and a couple animals as well (including the dog mentioned above).

Went to Fright Dome (they don't do this anymore; it was Circus-Circus for Halloween) with the girl I built the snowman with. Went with the kid that was brother with the person that would bully me. He ended up touching the inside of her thighs. It was a short night. Too busy honestly. I took apart a pen and touched people's clothes with it randomly in super crowded areas where we had no choice but to touch each other. There was a guy walking around in a snowman costume (big like massicot style) and someone knocked the head piece while he was walking, so he couldn't see, or something, I guess. I thought it was kind of funny. I didn't feel good later about the ink thing, I did it in irritation and frustration and I was high that night also. I hadn't actually thought it through too much. I didn't know the things that I know now. I wanted someone‚Äôs night to be ruined, like mine, there were other reasons aside from this.

Breaking apart VCRS in the garage. When I was in my teens.

Remember getting my fingers smashed in car doors and other doors. Just shaking it off like it was nothing.

Dropped a pair of scissors and it landed right in between my toes in the skin, I pulled it out and just walked it off.

Dropped a five-pound weight on my foot and fractured my small toe. This toe has been broken before while I was playing with our dog and jammed it into a coffee table. It doesn‚Äôt bend anymore. Used to get migraines that are equal to the amount of pain that breaking that toe felt like and fracturing it. The migraines (they may be a little worse honestly, as I get disabled sometimes) lasted way longer sometimes 24 hours. Concussions are hard in a different way but far more disabling in the long run. When a migraine is going it is like working with a broken bone and being dizzy at the same time. Sometimes makes me want to puke. I would get them all the time as a teen.

One of the girls I had a crush on in high school ended up screwing someone in the park or something. Though I had a conversation with her on the phone once. She told me I was in limbo. I guess she might have been right.

Put some nails under a former teacher‚Äôs car tire that made me cry in elementary school and was a dick to me all the time.

Tried to sneak into the girl's restrooms just to see what it looked like at my old elementary school (school was out for the day the janitor just left it open). Was there another time with the friend who robbed the other guy, and a girl. I was shooting him with my airsoft gun. He ended up chasing me with his skateboard and was trying to hit me with it. Spraypainted the slides and got the idea from other people having done it while I was in school. Spraypainted the side of someone's RV randomly with a long line. Didn't know the person it wasn't personal. It was just anger and evil and being carried away because, we just, I had just done the other stuff. I was pretty full of anger here the type that comes from pain and I let it out wrong. Looking at the person I was, I was very frustrated and still hanging around with the wrong people.

Went through some guy‚Äôs backyard to do a weed run with a friend (the same one as above). It was a shortcut to the house we were going to. This is when it was illegal to smoke weed. They told me the guy might shoot at us and that he had threatened to do it to people before.

The same friend that just about all the other bad stuff happened with gets on my computer and looks up two girls one cup or however you get to the website with it. It also fried that computer because at the time there was a virus attached to that website. If you don't know what it is, it is where one girl s+++s in a cup and another girl and her eat it her s+++. I told him to turn that s+++ off. I was like what the f+++. It was gross. I don't hate but I don't need to watch that crap either. He did it on another computer too to trash that computer.

During middle school I was asked to help a girl with some math. I had just learned this math and I thought I had it. I went to help her and lost all of it. I couldn't do it. Not that I was any good at math to begin with. Not being good at math wasn't the reason. I felt dumb as a result of freezing up, of my brain losing all its memory. I think it was the result of what had happened, between listening to people get rapped and my life being threatened, being shy as well, she was pretty after all. I was into her though. I just got shook and my brain didn't want to function.

Another incident during middle school was with an eighth grader while I was in sixth grade. This dude was a dick and I don't know why I hung out with them. I guess because I didn't really have anyone else. Not that it matters. He grabbed my backpack once and wouldn't let go of it. In the scuffle my arm turned red because I also wouldn't let go of it and the strap wrapped around my arm. The back had torn so I had to get a new one. I think he may have also heard about my problems outside of school since one of the brothers of the family I had all the problems with went to that school also. rode the same bus as me and everything.

I will probably add more to this later. As I said I can't remember everything all the time. Sometimes things come and go and then come back again. None of these memories I can say without doubt are fully detailed. They may be missing bits and pieces. Sometimes when reading things come back to me. It takes many times reprocessing it all.

\+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The stuff I know now. Which has helped my mental landscape tremendously.

Indian specialty coffee has come a long way! Really impressed with some of the roasters I tried and still many more on the list to go. 

Some standouts: Rosette Yeast CM Naturals Ratnagiri, Caffeine Baar Frozen Cherry, Tramways A Sassy Misfit, Kokoro Zazen, and Rogue Wave Ethipioan Teshome Gemechu.

1h9g2re,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScammerPayback/comments/1h9g2re/pig_butcher_scam/,Pig butcher scam?,"Hi there everyone,

I recently found a very cute chinese girl on Tinder and there was here number to add on whatsapp so I did.  
She asked who I was and how I got the number I told her and she said she only used it while traveling and that the tinder account should be deleted. We got to talking and there were some red flags right from the start.

1. She said she was in Shanghai and I am up to date with the world how it works and I know that you cannot use whatsapp in China unless you use VPN.  
2. The number on the whatsapp account is a vodafone one from the UK so it makes no sense to use it in China just for whatsapp.  
3. I asked her for her wechat and she said she does not get notifications there so its best to use whatsapp.  
4. I doubted its a scam so I asked her if we could video chat which she agreed upon imidiatelly and to my surprise it was the same person as the photos.

I decided to continue talking and see where it leads Im just curious. She said she has visited my country previously and she plans to come here again in January, she even asked If I wanted to meet up and grab a coffee which was weird straight off the bat but I just went with the flow said okay no problem. Then she told me how she and her ex got into business together and got rich, how she is the COO now in the fabric making business. Then out of nowhere she was gone for about half an hour returning with the message : ""sorry I was checking on my crypto I am investing in SFJB"" I asked what it was and she told me it is a new crypto started by the peoples bank of china and that her uncle is an executive there so she got some news.  
She asked me if I invest in something and I told her I am just a broke ass student rn, paying for my studies and groceries is all I have right now. She was even okay with that and continued to talk like nothing happened she does not even bring up the investing part anymore.

The red flags about the investing is this:

1. She sent me the website that she invests on and that is the only website where I could actually find FSJB.  
2. FSJB climbed like 50 percent in 2 days which was weird that it climbs that fast from 2 dollars to 3 in 2 days then 2 more days and now its 4$.  
3. I checked out the site on whois website. Its only been created last month and there is literally no information about it besides the 2 ip addresses that you can find in the US ( those are the server ips for the site)

Im pretty sure that it is a really the Pig butcher scam but I will see how it goes. As I said I do not have money to invest nor do I intend to. But first I will say to her that I thought about it and I am ready to sell my car and take out a loan of 50k on my apartement and that we should meet when she comes here and make a plan in person about how to invest. I really wanna see how long this scammers are willing to go. 

Please let me know what you think.

Best regards to you all and stay safe broskis.",2,1733653692.0,ScammerPayback,4,1.0,False

I have had a search but I‚Äôm still new to the whole
Process forgive me please if the answer is right in front of my eyes here 

Got my first machine  last weekend [SAGE Barista Express] and been playing about trying to get the settings right, from what iv been reading on my previous coffees it has been too coarse .. but let me tell you where I am now 

I have changed the grind to fine inside to grinder Ona setting of 4 

I am grinding to 18g and have an extract time
Of 25 seconds on my last attempt‚Ä¶ however I am getting 18g of coffee extracted (which I need to double I think if I am reading right ?) as you can imagine the pour is slow over these 25 seconds

But this is where I am now stuck - the next move ! Iv been back and forth a week and now I feel like I‚Äôm at square one again.

Any help or pointing me in the direction of the articles that can help will be much appreciated

1h9g0lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1h9g0lo/which_manual_machine_1000/,Which manual machine? [¬£1000],"Hi all I'm in the UK, thinking about upgrading my espresso setup! I've a fair amount of experience with other forms of coffee and a reasonable hand grinder (a timemore c2). Last year I got a beginner espresso machine (a swan nordic) but have been a bit unhappy with the results, and I recently learnt that it may be because it has a pressurised portafilter. I'm coming into a bonus soon, and I thought I'd like to upgrade my setup. I enjoy straight espresso, but I do use the milk wand to make hot chocolate for my kid.

Options are...

* upgrade the portafilter on the nordic with something random from amazon https://www.amazon.co.uk/NEOUZA-Bottomless-Portafilter-Compatible-Replacement/dp/B09CK91JFX

* https://www.cafelat.co.uk/products/cafelat-robot-barista ¬£400

* https://www.harrods.com/en-gb/p/la-pavoni-professional-lusso-coffee-machine-000000000006837005

The la pavoni is more expensive (but on offer?) and it looks like I'd have to upgrade to get the kind of pressure gauge that'd be useful?

I quite like the look of the robot as a nice compromise, and I do enjoy manual machines! But maybe it's too much of a leap when I'm still such a beginner? Any thoughts?

Maybe this year I'll meet someone nice? Someone worth keeping throughout the new year. 

Not looking for anything in particular. Could be a kakwentuhan, a friend, hobby buddy, or potential d√†te, or idk let's just see where it goes. SFW only.

Some stuff about me ~ simple and decent looking, tall-ish and slim. I'm more of an introvert but has a playful side also. Fond of running and photography. Beach, coffee, and music are my comfort stuff. 

I'm hoping to connect with someone who's decent and smart looking, taller (>5'8 üòÖ) than me and slim-ish also. Would be really nice if you have a nice speaking voice. Hope you're someone warm and has hobbies you're enthusiastic about. Single, of course.

If this piqued your interest, hit me up maybe by sharing what you're looking forward to in the new year. See yuh! üçª
